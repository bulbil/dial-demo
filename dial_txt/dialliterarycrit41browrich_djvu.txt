EARLY CRITICAL OPINIONS OF 

WINSTON CHURCHILL'S new novel 




CONISTON 

describe it as 

"first of all a delightful love-story, 
vigorous, vibrant and realistic." 



CONISTON 

" is a love-story of the sort that warms the cockles of the heart, arouses 
every laggard and latent impulse of sympathy, and lends enthusiasm to 
fancy ... its sentiment is so true, its humor so native and abiding, and 
its grip on the eternal verities so strong, that its characters seem to live 
and move in the immediate present." 

CONISTON 

" is by long odds the best, the most important, and most significant novel 
that has proceeded from Mr. Churchill's pen — if it be not, indeed, the 
best American novel yet brought to public notice and attention. . . . 
With amazing constructive skill and superb literary 
art ... its alluring and powerful demonstration of 
human nature glows and flashes through the pages 
of this long narrative." 

CONISTON 

" is the great novel of the year."

POETRY AND ARBORICULTURE. 



The daily press has reported the slaughter, 
in a New York town, of some grand old white 
oaks that lifted their heads in majesty one hun- 
dred feet heavenward, each of them " a forest 
waving on a single stem "; and, with shame be 
it confessed, these monarchs of the tree world 
were sacrificed to the demands of a local spoke- 
factory. Wood that has for centuries matched 
its strength with the fierce fury of winter blasts, 
and braved the devasting thunderbolt, must 
henceforth patiently describe its wearisome 
epitrochoids (if that be the name of the curve) 
beneath the weight of some groaning dray, or 
more nimbly revolve with the nickel-mounted 
hubs and silently-s\s'ift rubber tires of some 
smart trap, or festive tally-ho, or road devour- 
ing motor car, — not altogether ignoble uses, it 
may be urged, but served at how lamentable a 
cost ! 

The annual recurrence of arbor-day may have 
suggested to many besides the present writer the 
query whether, in the present endeavor of all 
enlightened persons to create a public sentiment 
adverse to the reckless .sacrifice of natural beauty 
to commercial utility — and even, as is often 
proved in the end, to commercial inutility, — 
poetry may not be enlisted as a powerfid ally in 
the righteous cause, a more powerfid ally, that is, 
than we have yet recognized it to be ; and this, 
too, without gi>*ing the slightest oflFense to the ad- 
vocates of " art for art's sake," or incurring the 
faintest suspicion of seeking to harness Pegasus 
to the plough. Qmte the contrary'. The poetry 
of trees and forests and woodland scenery may, 
by appealing to our love of natural beauty, serve 
the interests of arboriculture, and, by a pleasing 
reciprocation of benefits, ai-boricidture Avill yield 
inspiration to the muse of the nature-losing poet. 
The right influences thus brought into action 
by the apostles of sweetness and light shoidd 
broaden down from the more to the less cid- 
tured, until all good Americans shall feel the 
same instinctive respect for noble trees and 
majestic forests that is entertained in the older 
communities of the world. Something of the 
same recoarnition accorded to the rights of 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



animals will thus more and more be yielded to 
the claims of our rooted and stationary fellow- 
ci'eatures. 

Although the poet has, of necessity, less often 
taken a theme for his song from the calm 
beauty of field and forest than from the rich 
multiplicity of human emotions and passions 
and actions, yet a very considerable body of 
verse coidd be got together descriptive of wood- 
land scenes and of the majesty of individual 
trees, to say nothing of the many poems that, 
like " The Building of the Sliip " and " The 
Wonderful One-Hoss Shay," treat of the uses 
of timber — mechanic uses, which it is our pres- 
ent purpose to put entirely out of mind. The 
Old Testament writers, as living in a poorly- 
wooded land, make but few references to trees. 
The green bay tree of the Psalmist, and the 
cedars of Lebanon, are familiar to us ; the oak, 
cypress, sycamore, pine, and fir tree are also 
occasionally mentioned, as are various kinds of 
fruit trees ; and the ash occurs once, in " Isaiah." 
But of the stately beauty of the forest primeval 
we get hardly a hint. In his " History of Israel," 
Ewald says that Solomon made gardens, vine- 
yards, and pleasant parks around Jerusalem, and 
that he wrote a book describing all the plants and 
trees cultivated there ; but this treatise is lost. 

Homer, rich in marine effects, gives but a 
faint idea of the charms of sylvan scenery. In 
the sixth book of the " Iliad " he aptly likens 
the successive generations of men to the leaves 
of the trees, ever dying and as often renewed ; 
and in the " Odyssey " he pictures the grove 
that surrounds Calypso's grotto, and also de- 
scribes the orchards of the Phaeacians. But, 
though other references to trees are not lacking, 
Homer is by no means the forest-lover's poet. 
Hesiod, now and then, is a little more satisfying, 
as in the first book of his " Works and Days," 
where he depicts a country rejoicing in peace 
and plenty, and adds : 

'• Nature indulgent o'er their land is seen ; 
With oaks, high-towering, are their mountains green ; 
With heavy mast their arms diffusive bow, 
While from their trunks rich streams of honey flow." 

Theocritus, as some of his Idyls prove, was 
sensitive to the beauty of tree and forest. He 
sings of the " clustering pine-tree that scatters 
many a cone," and elsewhere thus voices his 
love of the same tree : 

" Yon breezy pine, whose foliage shades the springs, 
In many a vocal whisper sweetly sings." 

Moschus celebrates the calm delights of repose 

beneath a plane-tree, whose leafage, cool and 

deep, guards the sleeper from every annoyance. 

The Greek tragic poets, as might have been 



expected, offer scarcely anything to our purpose. 
But coming down to the post-classical poets of 
Alexandria, we find in the " Argonautica " of 
Apollonius Rhodius at least two graceful refer- 
ences to trees. A hamadryad thus pleads for 
the life of an oak : 

" Oh, rustic, stay, nor wound the hallowed rind ; 
For ages with that stem I live entwined." 

Again, after the too-adventurous Phaethon has 
come to grief, and, hurled from the sun-chariot 
by Jove's thunderbolt, has perished in the river 
Eridanus, we read : 

" The daughters of the sun, a mournfid band, 
Along the bank, enclosed in poplars stand." 

Items such as these, however, are rather matters 
of curiosity than of literary interest. Passing 
to a better-known poet than old Apollonius, we 
find in Ovid's story of Orpheus and Eurydice 
all the trees of the forest described, with appro- 
priate epithets, as following the sweet strains of 
the musician's lyre ; and in the legend of Ver- 
tumnus and Pomona the patroness of the apple- 
tree is represented as a scientific arboriculturist. 
In the same poet occurs the following descrip- 
tion of an aged oak : 

" An ancient oak in the dark centre stood, 
The covert's glory, and itself a wood ; 
Garlands embraced its shaft, and from the boughs 
Himg tablets, monuments of prosperous vows. 
In the cool dusk its unpierced verdure spread 
The Dryads oft their hallow'd dances led ; 
And oft when round their gauging arms they cast, 
Full fifteen ells it measured in the waist." 

Virgil, too, is responsive to the appeal of wood- 
land scenes. When ^neas reached Italy, one 
of the first sights to attract his attention and 
win his admiration was : 

" A mighty grove of glancing trees. 
Embowered amid the sylvan scene, 
Old Tiber winds his banks between." 

In the second book of the " Georgics," all the 
methods, natural and artificial, by which trees 
are propagated, are enumerated in realistic de- 
tail. A fine description of the oak is also met 
with in this poem. 

Passing abruptly (to avoid the tedium of too 
long lingering among the ancients) from Virgil 
to Spenser, we come upon a good picture of a 
rugged old oak in " The Shepherd's Calendar " 
(February) : 

" There grew an aged tree on the green, 
A goodly Oak sometime had it been 
With arms full strong and largely displayed : 
The body big and mightily pight, 
Thoroughly wooded and of wondrous height ; 
Whylorae had been the king of the field, 
And muckle mast to the husband did yield, 
And with his nuts larded many swine : 
But now the gray moss marred his rine ; 
His bar^d boughs were beaten with storms. 
His top was bald and wasted with worms, 
His honour decayed, his branches sere." 



1906.] 



THE DIAL. 



The swine-feeding virtues of this oak recall the 
early English custom of estimating the value of 
forests by the number of hogs they would fatten ; 
and in the survey made at the time of the Nor- 
man Conquest, and embodied in Doomsday 
Book, woods of a single hog have a place on the 
list. The derivation of acorn (from " aec " or 
** ac " and '• corn," as being the com produced 
by the oak) is interesting. The tree first yields 
acorns at about eighteen years of age, and it 
does not attain its maximmn height and pro- 
ductiveness until it is much older. The vulgar 
proverb, •' soon ripe, soon rotten," holds true 
throughout the vegetable world. Dryden voices 
the prevailing belief as to the great age attained 
by the oak, in these lines : 

" Three centuries he grows, and three he stays 
Supreme in state ; and in three more decays." 

But from competent authority we leam that the 
tree's maximum tale of years far exceeds the 
limit here set, being in fact about two thousand. 
There are flourishing in England to-day trees 
that are said to have been old enough to cut for 
lumber when A-Yilliani the Conqueror landed in 
1066. Venerable indeed are such veterans of 
the tree- world. The historic oaks of this and 
other lands — the Chai-ter Oak, the Eliot Oak, 
the Ro^al Oak, and coimtless others — need not 
here detain us. Of an oak with its historic pos- 
sibilities still before it, Oliver Wendell Holmes 
writes : " There is an oak a mile from where I 
am now sitting, at Beverly Farms, Massachu- 
setts, to which I always lift my hat. What a 
future that robust, fidl-bloo<led, broad-armed, 
symmetrical young giant has before it if the 
human ephemera which carries an axe in its 
grasp does not sacrilegiously invade its life I " 
Less hardy and shorter-lived than the oak, but 
more pliantly graceful in form, is the elm, espe- 
ciallj' the American elm. Dr. Holmes speaks of 
" the grand old patriarchs, those mighty elms, 
before which I often, when alone, and without 
affectation, bowed my head, and could without 
shame have knelt and kissed the turf at their 
feet." With a pleasing bit of imagery he has 
told us that '• the proper rule for measuring the 
girth of the trunk of an elm is the same as that 
for taking the measure of a lady's girdle," — 
that is, in the waist of the tree, just where the 
trunk begins to expand downward and to throw 
out its mighty roots, and to broaden upward into 
its powerfid branches. This point is usually 
about five feet from the ground. In rhythmic 
and poetic phrase the same writer somewhere 
exclaims, " What tales, if there were tongues in 
trees, this giant elm could teU ! "" It might well 



have been with our splendid ebns in mind that 
Walt Whitman asked, " Why are there trees 
I never walk luider but large and melodious 
thoughts descend upon me ? " Lowell — under 
the trees at Elmwood, we may suppose — TNTites : 

" I care not how men trace their ancestry, 
To ape or Adam : let them please their whim ; 
But I in June am midway to believe 
A tree among my far progenitors. 
Such sympathy is mine with all the race, 
Such mutual recog^tion vaguely sweet 
There is between us, — surely there are times 
When they consent to own me of their kin. 
And condescend to me, and call me cousin." 

Of the charms of countless other trees, as 
celebrated in song and story, only the briefest 
hints can here be given. How vivid and how 
familiar the picture presented in these three lines 
from Wordsworth : 

" I saw far off the dark top of a pine 
Look like a cloud, — a slender stem the tie 
That bound it to its native earth." 

What could be more magnificent than the horse- 
chestnut in full bloom, its thousand chandeliers 
aflame, and the whole as resplendent as an illu- 
minated pagoda ? The catalpa, in its pride of 
foliage and blossom, presents a somewhat sim- 
ilar appearance. Who can celebrate fitly, even 
in stateliest verse, the grandeur of the maple in 
autumn ? Who will picture its rosy charms (we 
have in mind now the red maple) in spring? 
Lowell has attempted the double task : 

" The maple puts her corals on in May, 
While loitering frosts about the lowlands cling', 
To be in tune with what the robins sing'. 
Plastering new log huts 'mid her branches gray ; 
But when the autumn southward turns away, 
Then in her veins bums most the blood of spring, 
And every leaf, intensely blossoming, 
Makes the year's sunset pale the set of day." 

It is, however, a tardy spring that sees the maple 
first donning her corals in May ; nor, in prosaic 
truth, are the maple blossoms light enough in 
hue to suggest the delicate pink of coral. Of 
the chestnut in springtime, and its swelling 
buds, Tennyson has written : 

" What an hour was that, 

When after roving in the woods 
(Twas April then), I came and sat 

Below the chestnuts, when their buds 
Were glistening to the breezy blue." 

The sombre beauties of evergreen groves have 
been celebrated by many poets. Most fanuliar 
to us are the opening lines of " Evangeline ": 

'* This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the 

hemlocks, 
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the 

twilight, 
Stand like Druids of eld, ■with voices sad and prophetic, 
Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.'' 

From these stately lines to Bryant's *' Forest 
Hymn " is a natural transition : 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



" The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned 
To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, 
And spread the roof above them — ere he framed 
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back 
The sound of anthems ; in the darkling wood, 
Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down, 
And ofPered to the Mightiest solenm thanks 
And supplication." 

Still finer and more natural are the sentiments 
of the same poet's " Inscription for the Entrance 

to a Wood ": 

" Even the green trees 
Partake the deep contentment ; as they bend 
To the soft winds, the sun from the blue sky 
Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene." 

Let US remember, too, Bryant's "Autumn 
Woods," glowing with color and murmuring 
with the southwest wind, — perhaps the best of 
his woodland lays. 

With Wordsworth, it is needless to say, the 
lover of nature must ever delight " to range her 
blooming bowers and spacious fields," 

" Or pierce the gloom of her majestic woods ; 
Koaming, or resting under grateful shade 
In peace and meditative cheerfulness." 

The gustatory delights of a fruit orchard need 
not here be enlarged upon, although the pleasure 
of owning a few cherry-trees, snowy wonders in 
early May, or a half-dozen rows of apple-trees, 
clothing themselves in pink-and-white prettiness 
as the summer approaches, is not exclusively a 
gastronomic satisfaction. Says our always- 
enjoyable Dr. Holmes, in writing of his large 
apple-trees : " Fine trees they are, and I am grate- 
ful to them, and even proud of two of them, — 
the ' green tent ' and the ' seven-branched candle- 
stick '; but they are lacking in ' distinction,' as 
Matthew Arnold would say, and are fruit- 
peddlers, while the elm deals only in sunbeams." 

It is a cheering sign of the times, and one that 
goes far to offset the discouraging symptom noted 
at the beginning of this article, that one million 
young trees are to be, or already have been, dis- 
tributed by the State Forestry Commission to 
dweUers on the treeless plains of western Kansas. 
The pioneer's inveterate hatred of " timber " 
we may hope to be passing away. To quote 
once more, and for the last time, the tree-loving 
Autocrat, " when trees are spoken of under the 
fatal name of timber, the settler may expect 
soon to find himself in a graveyard of blackened 
stumps," or, worse still, a cemetery of those 
gaunt horrors, girdled trees, done to death in 
shameful fashion, and lifting their naked and 
stiffening arms in mute appeal to heaven. But 
let us hope that blackened stumps and girdled 
trees are fast becoming things of an irrevocable

The Western Course of Empire.* 



The important series of reprints of " Early 
Western Travels," imder the editorship of Dr. 
Thwaites, increasingly reveals its value as the 
work proceeds. The earlier volumes were re- 
viewed in The Dial for November 16, 1904, 
where attention was called to the general aspects 
of the series, and especially to its worth as ex- 
hibiting in graphic contemporaneous accounts 
the procession of civilization advancing into the 
West from the days of the contact between the 
French and the English. 

The present volumes, continuing the series to 
Vol. XX., embrace the period between the War 
of 1812 and the early thirties, and fall into 
three groups. The first is made up of James 
Flint, Hulme, Flower, Woods, Faux, and Welby 
(English travellers of whom all except Flint de- 
vote especial attention to English immigration 
to Illinois), and Ogden, Bullock, and Bradbury 
(in part), who in briefer sketches depict condi- 
tions in the Mississippi Valley following the War 
of 1812. A second gToup consists of Astoria 
fur-traders, Franchere and Ross, who made the 
voyage around the Cape to the Oregon country, 
and Bradbury and Brackenridge, who accom- 
panied Astor's overland party well up the 
Missouri. The third gi'oup, including Nuttall, 
Long, Pattie, and Gregg, includes explorers and 
traders in the Southwest, and especially in the 
arid country west and south of the Missouri. 

Together, these travellers present a remark- 
ably interesting picture of American expansion

THE DIAL 



following the AVar of 1812. We are made 
to see the tide of settlement reaching the edge 
of the prairies of the Old Northwest even under 
the discouragements of the panic of 1820, and 
are shown the far-reaching effect of this body of 
cheap lands upon discontented English farmers. 
We get graphic views of back^^'oodsmen making 
new frontiers up the Missouri and the Arkansas, 
and of planters carrying the question of slavery 
into the new lands. Beyond these areas of set- 
tlement we see the daring hunters and Indian 
traders, whose predecessors had traversed the 
forests of the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes, 
now pushing forward to reveal the mysteries of 
the arid plains and the Rocky Movmtains, there 
to contest with Englishmen the possession of the 
New Northwest in the Oregon country, and with 
Spaniards the New Southwest in the region of 
Santa Fe. A fresh horizon of American ambi- 
tion rises into view : the Pacific Coast engages the 
interest of pioneer and statesman, and another 
advance is prepared into Spanish American 
lands. 

Among the best of the English travellers is 
James Flint, whose moderation and insight make 
his travels especially valuable for the period 
1818-1820, when he studied agricultural condi- 
tions from Long Island to Ohio and into Canada. 
He is alert to note new agricultural implements, 
prices of lands and products, wages and freight- 
rates. The beginning of the agricidtural occu- 
pation of the edges of the prairies engages his 
interest. The changing values in this period of 
disturbed industrial conditions diminish the reli- 
ability of his observations, but the panic of 1819 
itself gave him occasion for usefid comments on 
Western banking and currency. His sojourn 
of several months in Indiana furnished the op- 
portunity for a series of usefid chapters on 
American political, economic, and social condi- 
tions, which make him an interesting predecessor 
of his feUow-countryman James Bryce, although 
it must be confessed that he is not in the same 
class. He gives intelligent estimates of the rela- 
tive advantages of the different sections for im- 
migrants, and predicts the effect of slavery not 
only in turning foreigners away from the South, 
but also in the inevitable discord produced along 
the extensive boundary-line between free and 
slave States, His friendly attitude toward the 
West as a whole, and his faith in its future, was 
shown by his settling in Indiana. 

Ogden's " Letters from the West " and Bul- 
lock's " Sketch of a Journey," briefer sketches, 
are somewhat inappropriately placed in the 
present series, in the same volume with Gregg's 



" Commerce of the Prairies." The first of these 
travellers was a New England Quaker who spent 
two years, beginning in 1821, along the Ohio 
towns. He furnishes little valuable information, 
much of his description being second-hand. 
Bullock was an English jeweller interested in 
natural history, who twice visited Mexico in the 
search for curios, and on his visit in 1827 voy- 
aged from New Orleans up the ^lississippi to 
Cincinnati. Here he purchased a large estate 
across the river, and plotted an interesting site 
for a future city. Returning by way of the cities 
along Lake Erie and the Erie Canal, he gives 
us an appreciative view of the country through 
which he passed. New Orleans, with its twelve 
to fifteen hundred flat-boats lying along the 
river, its busy commerce in cotton and sugar, its 
cosmopolitan population, is vividly portrayed. 
Cincinnati so captivated him that he determined 
to make it his future home. Through central 
Ohio to Sandusky his stage route took him past 
Indian reservations, which, under his somewhat 
idealistic pen, became centres of agricultural 
prosperity. Buffalo, reached by steamboat, re- 
minded him of a Dutch town ; and here too he 
describes the Indian remnants giving way before 
the whites. On the Erie Canal he met many 
poor Irish emigrants on their way to Ohio. 

The English settlement in Edwards County, 
Illinois, called out a large amovmt of contro- 
versial literature in this period. Founded by 
Morris Birkbeck and George Flower, on the 
prairie between the Big and the Little Wabash, 
in 1817, it was an interesting experiment in 
the occupation of the neglected prairie lands, by 
wealthy and scientific English farmers who had 
left England in the years of political discontent 
and economic depression that followed the War 
of 1 8 1 2 . The story of the evolution of society in 
this region, and of the attempts to apply the agri- 
cidtural methods of the mother country to Illinois 
prairies is a most interesting one. Through it 
runs also a romance, that divided the founders, 
and resulted in separation into two rival ham- 
lets, Albion and Wansborough. The experiment 
attracted wide attention in England, called out 
the opposition of English agricultural interests, 
aroused the jealousy of Eastern land speculators, 
whose ideas were voiced by the famous Cobbett 
(Peter Porcupine), and led many Englishmen 
to travel into the West. It made clear the fact 
that gentleman farming for profit in Western 
prairies was not a practicable system : whatever 
opposing sympathies the travellers had, they 
united in the conclusion that only the strong- 
handed toilers could grapple with frontier farm-

ing. Free lands furnished only the opportunity 
for liard work in this frontier, where a wage 
class hardly existed. 

Of the voluminous literature called out by 
this settlement, Dr. Thwaites prints the narra- 
tives of Hulme, Woods, Faux, Welby, and the 
letters of Richard Flower, the father of George 
Flower. The student will find in Birkbeck's 
" Notes on a Journey " and " Letters from Illi- 
nois," and in George Flower's " History of the 
English Settlement," important accoimts to 
supplement the above ; but the editor has selected 
for reprinting the works that are less accessible. 
Hulme's " Journal " abounds in usefid notes on 
economic conditions, wages, prices, etc. He 
writes in the spirit of fairness, though he de- 
cided against remaining in Illinois ; but his work 
was unfairly used by Cobbett in his " Year's 
Residence " to attack the West as a field for 
English emigrants. Flower's letters are written 
in defense, but contain valuable information on 
Western conditions. Woods gives us a straight- 
forward account of his journey to the West, his 
land purchases, and his experience with the 



retreating frontiersmen. 



Faux was a less agreeable type of the John 
Bull farmer, lacking adaptability to new condi- 
tions, and devoid of good breeding. He talks 
with unrestrained freedom of the seamy side of 
American life, and professedly has a mission to 
deter Englishmen from removing to a land of 
sharpers. The primitive conditions gave him 
only disgust. Faux's strictures were not kindly 
received by contemporary Americans, and later 
critics have found liim guilty on many counts 
of violating good taste, truthfulness, and judg- 
ment. But his book is a useful one. If the win- 
dows which he opens upon American conditions 
following the financial panic of 1820 show vistas 
of the back yard instead of the well-kept lawns, 
they are none the less real windows ; and after 
due allowance for his prejudices, the reader will 
find in Faux abundant repayment for opening his 
pages. The narrative of his sojourn in Charles- 
ton society and among interior planters fur- 
nishes very readable and intimate views of the 
life of the slaveholders, while his Washington 
visit opened to him an acquaintance with large 
land-owners from whom he drew more or less 
reliable accoimts of the agricultural conditions 
of the region. His data on Western agrarian 
economics, when checked by that of other con- 
temporaries, is a useful source of information on 
the cost of clearing lands, the profits in successive 
years, and kindred subjects. But his general 
attitude toward the country is sununed up in this 



statement : " The American, considered as an 
annual, is filthy, bordering on the beastly ; as a 
man, he seems a being of superior capabilities. 
. . . All his vices and imperfections seem nat- 
ural ; those of the semi-barbarian. He is ashamed 
of none of them." 

In Welby's account we have another amusing 
and unfavorable view of Western life. He jour- 
neyed to Illinois in a handsome phaeton and 
pair, attended by a groom in top-boots and on 
horseback. Naturally enough, this intrusion 
into backwoods taverns created consternation 
and resentment, and led in turn to disrespectfid 
remarks on the democratic and vulgar society of 
the frontier on the part of this English visitor. 

Several of these travellers give considerable 
space to the very interesting German commu- 
nistic experiment at Harmony in Indiana. All 
were impressed by the thrift and prosperity of 
the settlement, which was indeed a revelation 
of what combined and differentiated industrial 
activity could do in building up a successful 
economic society on the frontier. In this con- 
nection may be noted the repeated evidence that 
a home market developed by the rise of the little 
cities along the Ohio Valley increased the value 
of lands and furnished a profitable market for 
the products of the adjacent regions. No care- 
ful reader of these travels can fail to see more 
clearly how Clay's American System woidd ap- 
peal to the West. 

In general it may be said that the student 
of society, and the economist as well as the his- 
torian, can profit by the perusal of these travels. 
With all their prejudices and superficial infor- 
mation, they present, as it is nowhere else so well 
presented, the picture of society in the making 
in the American back country : Indian yielding 
to backwoodsmen ; backwoodsman selling out 
his little clearing on the approach of capital and 
civilization ; farming rapidly giving rise to cities 
as markets for crops, and these in turn calling 
into existence the mercantile and professional 
classes, and creating irresistible demands for 
manufacturing and improvements in transporta- 
tion. Hard on the heels of the woodchoppers 
came the academies and churches ; and then the 
work of social evolution had to be begun anew 
on a remoter frontier. 

Turning from the Middle West to the trans- 
Mississippi empire, a new and fascinating theme 
is presented ; for here American civilization 
was brought to its early survey of the Great 
Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific 
Ocean. In his republication of the narratives of 
Brackenridge, Bradbury, Franchere, and Ross,

Dr. Thwaites enables the reader of Irving's 
"• Astoria " to see the Far West, not idealized 
by the style of the great author, but in the clear 
Western sunlight, realistically if not artistically 
set forth. Xuttall, a scientist who visited the 
Arkansas region in 1819, has a value, aside 
from his scientific observations, in the view which 
he gives of the period when American pioneers 
and the Indians were mingled together in this 
frontier area. The student whose knowledge of 
Arkansas at this time is confined to discussions 
over its territorial status, and to whom the 
tongue of settlement depicted in the Census 
maps of the distribution of popidation in 1820 
means but little, vriH find in Nuttall the oppor- 
tunity- to realize the coarse rough life that was 
going on in this newly occupied wilderness. 

To Long's Expedition Dr. Thwaites gives 
four volmues, reprinting James's " Accovmt " 
in the London edition, modified by transferring 
the notes to the foot of the pages and including 
various supplementary material from the Phila- 
delphia edition. This "Yellowstone Expedition," 
imdertaken diu-ing 1819 and 1820, was sent out 
by the United States Government, with the com- 
bine<l purpose of extending the military posts 
up the ^lissoxiri in order to ovei-awe the Indians 
and diminish British influence, and of fur- 
nishing scientific information concerning the 
trans-Missouri coimtry. The latter project was 
confided to Major Long, who, with a party of 
scientists, proceeded from Pittsburg to the 
Rocky Movmtains by way of the South Platte, 
and returned in two detachments by descending 
the Arkansas and the Canadian Rivers. The 
party were but poorly equipped by the Gov- 
ernment, for the panic of 1819 compelled 
retrenchment. The scientific residts were not 
of enduring value, and as an exploration it was 
not especially productive of new discoveries, the 
lack of equipment preventing them from pene- 
trating the mountain valleys, although James 
distinguishetl himself by making the first ascent 
of Pike's Peak. By the confiising reports of 
Indians, Long was led to descend the Canadian 
under the mistaken idea that he had reached 
the upper waters of the Red River, which his 
instructions required him to explore. Nevei-the- 
less, the " Western Engineer," the first steam- 
boat to ascend the Missouri above Chariton 
(near the present Glascow), bore them along 
the line of advancing pioneers : and the des- 
criptions of this new area of frontier settlement 
are interesting. Quite as useful is the account of 
life in the sparse settlements between Arkansas 
and St. Louis, given by the returning explorers. 



Valuable also is the data on the sociology of 
the Indians of the plains, especially that of the 
Omahas. The most enduring result of Long's 
expedition, however, was the characterization of 
the region of the plains as the Great American 
Desert, unsuited for agricultural occupation, 
and valuable chiefly as a western frontier bar- 
rier against Indians and foreign nations. 

A different type of book is Pattie's " Narra- 
tive " of the wanderings of a trapper. His 
grandfather was a pioneer in Kentucky, serving 
in the frontier fighting under Logan and George 
Rogers Clark ; his father, as the editor points 
out, joined the Boones in the migration to Mis- 
souri, and in this new frontier defended block- 
houses against the Indians in the War of 1812, 
The Patties, father and son, conducted a trading 
caravan up the Platte to Santa Fe in 1824, and 
after romantic adventures, including the rescue 
from the Indians of a Spanish senorita, daugh- 
ter of the Governor, they secured permission to 
trap on the Gila River. In this distant land, the 
adventurous Patties traversed the wilderness be- 
tween the Big Horn and the Gila, until in 1827 
they followed this river into California, suffering 
horrible hardships in the deserts before they 
reached San Diego. Here they were promptly 
jailed by the governor, and the elder Pattie died 
in his cell. The son, after his release from prison, 
gives a most interesting account of California 
life in this period before the coming of the Amer- 
ican pioneer ; but his hatred of the Mexicans for 
the treatment which had been received no doubt 
colors his narrative. Passing into Mexico, he 
finally returned by way of New Orleans to Ken- 
tucky. The especial value of the narrative lies 
in the accoimt of the life that went on in the 
Spanish- American Southwest prior to American 
exploitation. But it has an interest from the 
fact that it is a weU-told story of adventure, and 
because Pattie broke a new trail for Americans 
to the Pacific. 

Even more valuable for its portraiture of 
conditions in the arid lands is the classic " Com- 
merce of the Prairies, or the Journal of a Santa 
Fe Trader," by Josiah Gregg, here reproduced 
in two volumes. The work is by far the best 
account of the trade along the Santa Fe Trail, 
and is at once accurate and fascinating. It cov- 
ers the period from the beginning of this trade 
to its interruption in 1841, when Mexico closed 
the custom-houses. The ^4\'id pictures of the 
daily life of the caravans from frontier ^lissouri 
across the deserts to the Mexican settlements 
cotdd not be better done, and the accounts of 
society and manners and customs among the

people over whom the tide of American advance 
was so soon to flow are as real as they are enter- 
taining. Gregg is an enthusiast over the prairies, 
in the sweep and freedom of which he rejoiced ; 
but he is at the same time the reliable historian 
of an influential commerce which had much to 
do with shaping the later conflict which resulted 
in the expansion of the United States into the 
region he describes. 

The same abundance of maps, pictures, and 
valuable annotations which characterize the 
earlier volume are to be found in these later issues 
of the series. In spite of rare slips, such as the 
attribution of the Hayne- Webster debate to 
1832, the notes themselves are among the most 
valuable of the contributions to American his- 
torical scholarship presented by this excellent

Revival, of ax Elizabethan Poet.* 

There are few English poets as well known 
by name as Drayton who is at the same time so 
little accessible to the general reader. Outside 
of libraries, it is almost impossible to get 
together a complete set of his works ; and the 
valuable selection made by Mr. Bullen has long 
been out of print. Other volimies of selections 
have been edited by Mr. Henry Morley and by 
Canon Beeching, — the latter's, published as late 
as 1899, heralding the manifestation of a new 
popular interest in the old poet who has been 
largely neglected save by scholars since the 
days of Lamb and Southey. Now there are 
announced a new complete variorum edition of 
Drayton's poems imder the editorship of Mr. 
Arnold Glover, and a new selection with an 
introduction by Mr. Arthur Symons. And as 
an avant-courieur to this concerted attempt to 
restore Drayton to his place of eminence in 
English literature, there has lately been pub- 
lished in England a little volume by Professor 
Oliver Elton which will tell the prospective 
reader of the poetry all that is known, through 
the researches of modern scholarship, of the man 
and his work. 

Professor Elton's essay, — for it is scarcely 
more, — is not a new piece of work, but was 
published ten years ago under the title of

obscure method of publication, the new bio- 
graphical and other matter which it contains 
escaped the notice of recent historians of En- 
glish literature, including Professor Courthope. 
" I regret," writes Professor Elton in his Intro- 
duction, "that Mr. Courthope was not saved 
some of the labor of his independent inquiries, 
and hope that my reasons may relieve him of 
some serious doubts he has expressed in regard 
to Drayton's behaviour. If Drayton acted as 
Mr. Courthope thinks, he was the less a gentle- 
man ; but if the charge is not true, no other is 
left against his personal character." 

The charge which is here referred to, and 
which is dealt with by Professor Elton in his 
first chapter, is that Drayton, having originally 
addressed Lady Bedford as " Idea " in the son- 
nets, later, out of pure spite, transferred that 
name to Anne Goodere, Lady Rainsford. A 
break Drayton did have with Lady Bedford, 
who had been his patron, never his mistress ; 
but the name " Idea," as Professor Elton con- 
clusively shows through a rather complicated 
but consistent concatenation of bibliographical 
evidence, had never been applied to that lady 
by the poet, but liad, from the very start, if we 
are to find any concrete personality behind this 
abstract term at all, referred exclusively to the 
other lady. Drayton is thus saved from the im- 
putation of having used the same series of verse 
twice under the same fanciful name of address 
in the service of two separate love-suits. 

Professor Elton does not overlook the theory, 
which has of late been so prominently brought 
forward and strongly sujiported by Mr. Sidney 
Lee, that Drayton, in conmaon with the other 
Elizabethan sonneteers, wrote in a purely lit- 
erary convention of the Renaissance, and that 
" Idea," instead of being Anne Goodere or any 
other real person, is, like Sidney's " Stella," 
Shakespeare's " Dark Lady," and the various 
other heroines of these sonnet sequences, a mere 
fiction required by the convention as it was taken 
over from French and Italian literature. To 
this theory, while allowing the weight of Mr. 
Lee's recent discovery of the hitherto unsus- 
pected extent of the indebtedness of the group 
as a whole to Petrarch, Desportes, Ronsard, and 
others. Professor Elton replies in the only man- 
ner possible for those who apprehend in their 
own consciousness the processes of art as modes 
of real experience, and who are susceptible to the 
charm and vitality of the best of these sequences 
as poetry. Between the two theories, — the one, 
that the Elizabethan sonnets transcribed in every 
detail real experience, and the other, that they

are merely translations or academic exercises 
supplied by piKerings from foreign poets, — 
there is a third way of interpreting them, that 
of the imaginative artist who gets his original 
impulse from his personal experience, but who 
proceeds in a mood of creative elation, filling out 
his frame with those themes, motives, and ex- 
pressions which, get them when he may, appear 
to him beautiful and worthy to be wrought into 
the work of his own heart and brain. Professor 
£lton writes most felicitously of Drayton's son- 
nets in this vein : 

" They are plastic experiments where the original 
impulse of lore or complaint is transflorured in the joy of 
fashioning; much as when a man should begin to paint 
his mistress' face upon a fan, but should find that it did 
not suit the spaces and design, and then should alter it 
into some happy pattern, perhaps inspired by another 
artist, but should stiU send her the offering as his 
handiwork in her honour. This kind of work will be 
undreamed of, if we forget that a shy gift may hide 
itself in a line of translation, or in what seems purely 
scholar's practice ; that the presence of a common theme 
in many artists, perhaps influencing one another, is a 
poor proof of the insincerity of any of them; and that 
the existence of weaker work on the same theme else- 
where or by the same hand does not prejudice the 
quality of a noble and graceful poem." 

In succeeding chapters. Professor Elton treats 
of the Satires and Odes, Later Works, and with 
a short critical chapter, concluding with a Bib- 
liography, Appendix, and an Index, that fill 
fully one-third of the volume. Here, then, is 
the preparation one shoidd need for the study 
and proper imderstanding of Drayton's volumi- 
nous works. And it may be said that if any- 
thing coidd find favor for Drayton in advance 
on the part of one unfamiliar with the poet and 
a little halting in his approach to such for- 
midable masses of verse, it woidd be Professor 
Elton's happy success in striking just the right 
note in presenting the claims of his poet for 
consideration. These claims are certainly modest 
and reasonable. Unlike so many editors and 
resurrectors of neglected reputations, he does 
not seem to be holding a brief which he is 
boimd to sustain at all costs. He admits that 
Draj'ton as a poet possessed industry rather than 
inspiration, although his patience and persever- 
ance, his fine scholarly equipment, his noble 
respect for his craft, and above all an inner 
sweetness of the man himself which yielded itself 
fully only as his years advanced, led him to real 
inspiration in more than one line and passage. 
Surely, to have ^NTitten one i)erfect sonnet, and 
to have approached Sidney, Spenser, and Shake- 
speare in others ; to have invented the form of 
the Heroical and of the Ode or Ballad ; to have 



been the author of Nympkidia ; to have prac- 
tised with some measure of success nearly every 
other form of composition known to his time, 
including forms so remote from each other as 
the epical narrative and the verse drama, — 
surely to have done these things was to have 
accomplished something to make him worthy of 
remembrance among the greater men with whom 
he lived. He was in all respects a representa- 
tive Elizabethan, — perhaps, judging by the 
scope and diversity of his work, the most repre- 
sentative, — indicating best of all, certainly 
better than Shakespeare, the general level of 
cidtivation and the general aims and tendencies 
of the age in letters. And he had that in him, 
too, which made him representative of even more 
than his age : his intense and ardent patriotism, 
which constitutes him, more than almost any 
other English poet, the national bard of Britain. 
Other greater English poets have dedicated their 
most glowing numbers to love of country ; but 
never has one lived so exclusively at the moment 
of inspiration in this pervading patriotism, or 
made inspiration so exclusively coextensive with 
patriotic enthusiasm as he. Hence has been 
shaped the kind of recognition which has been 
most freely accorded him. " Xo poet," writes 
one critic (Mr. Bullen), " is more thoroughly 
English than Michael Drayton ; there is not a 
poem in our literature that breathes a finer spirit 
of patriotism than the ' Ballad of Agincourt '; 
and who loved better than the author of the 
' Poly-olbion ' all the highways and byways of 
England, its lulls and dales, its woods and 
streams ? " 

The ' Poly-olbion ' is indeed, for the Briton 
of to-day, now that the face of England is sadly 
scarred since Drayton's time with iron rails and 
hideous factory towns, a kind of sacred reposi- 
tory of her pristine beauty and freshness. There 
England lives again as once she was before a 
material and progressive age had all but dried 
up the founts of poesy at her heart. It was the 
heart of Drayton that spoke through the lips of 
Ruskin, when that apostle of beauty and of na- 
ture poured forth his jeremiads over England's 
sylvan and pastoral defilement. Hence the more 
than merely surface significance of the revival, 
at this time, of work which has so long been 
allowed to slumber in old folios and scarce 
reprints. w. A. Bradley.

[July 1, 



An Appreciation of a Famous 
Violinist.* 



Mr. Upton and Miss Kelley, in their collab- 
orated work entitled "Remenyi, Musician and 
Man," have given us a book about a musician 
rather than a work on music. The personal 
element presses strongly forward in every page. 
Edouard Remenyi was incapable of classification ; 
as a violinist he represented himseK, not a school. 
With splendid technical equipment, he played 
with all his soul ; and so at times was carried 
away by his impetuous temperament to extrava- 
gant results. It was the custom in some critical 
quarters to stigmatize him as a sort of inspired 
charlatan who knew how to play all sorts of 
tricks on his violin for the popular edification. 
Nothing covdd have been farther from the truth. 
The same charge has been made against all artists 
who had eccentric manners or yielded in any 
unusual degree to the claims of a fiery nature. 
Paganini had to meet it ; so had Von Biilow ; so 
has De Pachmann. Remenyi was a trained and 
versatile musician who knew the classic literature 
of the violin and loved to play it to the people. 
He will always have the praise which belongs to 
those who have moved many thousands of souls 
with pure delight, and moved them deeply. 

Knowing, as he did, many of the great men of 
our times, — among them the musicians Wagner, 
Brahms, Liszt, Joachim, RafP, and others, — it 
is to be regretted that Remenyi did not write his 
memoirs, as he often talked of doing. In his 
later years he was a welcome guest at the home of 
Miss Gwendolyn Kelley in Columbus, and became 
a warm friend of both herself and her mother. 
To Miss Kelley were entrusted many of his let- 
ters and other biogi'aphical documents, with the 
intention of some day using them in making a 
story of his life. That hope was frustrated by 
his sudden death at San Francisco in 1898 ; but 
Miss Kelley, knowing his purpose, made as fidl 
a collection of material as possible, added her 
own graceful tribute of admiration, together with 
one from her mother, and secured, to edit the 
whole, the practised hand of Mr. George P. 
Upton, the well-known musical critic and author, 
of Chicago. The result is, accordingly, a cento 
of impressions, sketches, letters, anecdotes, in 
which, after all, we get a pretty clear idea of the 
ardent, whimsical, somewhat vain, but quite sim- 
ple and lovable nature of the man. His letters 
to Miss Kelley — generally signed "your old 
fiddler friend " — are a comical macaroni of

has arrived from San Francisco, and you would hear

double vengeance), and now at last, after years of 
musical and forced Careme (Lent), I am in a perfect 
exotic musical garden of Hesperides and musical 
Champs Elysees. I could make you now paint minia- 
tures, grandiatures, in oil, in pastel, in Tod und Teufel, 
that you would not recognize yourself, and that the 
female zealous paintress would, could, and should paint 
until nothing would remain of her but a spot — there 
now I must finish. I have to rehearse some foine new 
pieces of music of my own composition, des pieces qui ne 
se mouchent pas du pied. This means ' unpretetentious. 
pieces, yes, but devilishly good all the same.' 

Votre vieil ami, Ed. Remenyi." 

And this, from a letter dated August 16, 1897: 

" Xow my dear Corvina [he was fond of compli- 
menting Miss Kelley by calling her a descendant of 
Matthias Corvinus], a simple question: In your last 
letter you addressed me, ' Mon cher ami,' in to-day's

Corviniana's part absolutely erroneous, as I am not an 
Italian. If you want to be very polite to me yoti woidd 
be obliged to write ' Edes Remenyi Ur ' {' dear Remenyi 
Mister '). This is Hungarian. Herr, Monsieur, Signor, 
Senor, Dom, Don, Pane, Mister, are ' Ur ' in Hungarian, 
and the ' Ur ' cometh after the Remenyi, that is, Remenyi 
Mister. Now you know it.

between miy goodiest wish, desire, and will, and my

cheap, he can have one. I know of one. Tliousand 
million greetings and thanks to my good and genial

The book is well printed, and illustrated with 
interesting portraits ; and it may be heartily rec- 
ommended as a presentment of one of the most 
original of violinists.

Three Mex of the Rexascexce.* 



Any promising addition to the very limited 
number of books in English on the Renascence 
is sui-e of a cordial welcome among students of 
literatui-e and students of history alike. In his 
" Renascence Portraits, " Professor Paul Van 
Dyke has contributed a book of substantial 
value to all students of that interesting but often 
misinterpreted movement. The volume is an 
attempt to illustrate the Renascence by the de- 
scription of thi-ee men who were affected by it, 
typically and contemporaneously, in Italy, En- 
gland, and Germany. These men are Pietro 
Aretino, the Venetian satii-ist, whom Biu-ckhardt 
calls the founder of modern joiu*nalism ; Thomas 
Cromwell, the powerfid \acar-general of Henry 
the Eighth ; and Maximilian I., the first German 
Emperor trained under the New Learning. The 
three " portraits *' which make up the bidk of 
the voliune are biogi-aphical studies embo<l}Tng 
the well-authenticated residts of carefid research, 
and they are given a style of treatment which 
makes them enjoyable reading. The author be- 
lieves that the writer of history may worthily 
aspire to something more than scientific exact- 
ness ; he has succeeded in his own avowed pur- 
pose to be interesting. 

The initial essay is concerned with an expo- 
sition of what the Renascence was. Against 
the popidar idea, the author expresses his \aews 
m these words : 

" The Renascence was not an equivalent to the revival 
of classic antiquity. Nowhere has the undue liking of 
writers on history for memoi-able, sharp, and picturesque 
statements made more plain its evU effects upon popular 
misconceptions than in this matter. Large numbers of 
educated people believe that the Renascence began with 
the fall of Constantinople, which di-ove a crowd of Greek 
teachers into Italy and so reArived the knowledge of the 
classic world — mother of arts, literature, and learning." 

The fallacy of this popidar idea of the Re- 
nascence becomes quite apparent when one 
remembers that Petrarch, the " first of the mod- 
ems " and the more notable of his confreres of 
the early Renascence in Italy, were all dead or 
very old men by 1453. What bearing, there- 
fore, had the recovery of classic ciAalization upon 
the Renascence movement ? On this point the 
author's words afford a direct answer : 

" The truth is that the influence of classic antiquity 
in the art, the langiiage and the literature of Rome and 
Greece was only the means of accomplishing the Re- 
nascence ideal." 

Again he observes : 

" The end of the men of the Italian Reuascence was

York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



New 



a broader and more human culture of the mind, their 
favorite means the study of classic antiquity, but neither 
their means nor their end was the source of the impulse 
which moved them." 

This impulse is explained as " a revival of the 
love of truth and beautj', making men more sen- 
sitive to the world around them and quicker to 
respond to its glories of form and color with 
vi\dd emotions of pleasure." This revival foimd 
in the uncovering of classic cvdture a " new and 
better means of expression." This is a some- 
what more direct statement of the same view 
that is presented by such authorities as Burck- 
hardt and Symonds, and by almost every recent 
writer on the Middle Age. Yet one finds a 
scholar of no less eminence than Sidney Lee, in 
his brilliant essay's on sixteenth century En- 
glishmen, tending to emphasize the causal, rather 
than the instrmnental, importance of the clas- 
sical discovery in the Renascence of Western 
Europe. With no disposition to fall into a meta- 
physical defense of his position. Professor Van 
Dyke states his belief that " to use the word 
Renascence intelligently, we must see behind 
it the men of the Renascence "; that whether 
it be true that man helps to make his history 
or is made by it, " we act as if it were true 
that he helps to make it," and he contends 
that to assume that personality is a leatling factor 
in the life of our own day justifies the assump- 
tion of its potency in the life of the sixteenth 
century. 

It is to the author's credit that he has given 
us, in his first Portrait, the fullest and most 
trustworthy account of Pietro Aretino to be 
found in English. Aretino has received but brief 
treatment at the hands of Symonds and Burck- 
hardt : and much new light has been thrown on 
his character since their works were written. 
His importance as an illustration of the spirit 
of the later Italian Renascence is very great. 
Well known to Englishmen in Addison's day, 
the fame, or rather the ill-fame, of this remark- 
able sycophant gradually lapsed into obscurity, 
until to-day, even among the etlucated, he is 
scarcely known by name. The researches of 
Italian scholars have recently made the writings 
of this erstwhile " Perverter of morals and let- 
ters " accessible to the extent to which they have 
sur\aved, so that it is now possible to study 
Aretino soberlj^ in the light of the diseased age 
in which he lived. 

Aretino spent the last thirty years of his life 
in Venice, where he died in 1557. Unaided by 
a knowledge of the himianities, he developed in 
the vernacidar a style of expression remarkable

[July 1, 



for its facility and power. His mastery of pas- 
quinade made him in truth the " Scourge of 
Princes." He reduced invective and eulogy to 
a successful commercial system. The dread or 
pleasure which his pen inspired became a con- 
tinual source of revenue from the official incum- 
bents of both church and state. His knowledge 
of the crimes and rumors of crimes chargeable to 
the priests and princes of Europe made it desir- 
able for them to keep the facts of their careers 
out of his Giudizi, periodically circulated and 
eagerly read. On the principle that ofPenders 
hate publicity, he demanded gifts from promis- 
ing victims as a condition of his silence or eulogy. 
Henry VIII., Francis I., and Charles V. were 
among those who pensioned him ; such was the 
power of the press in its incipiency ! He was 
always ready to confer immortality for a sub- 
sidy — an exchange of " servitu " for " cortesia." 
In return for generous treatment, he thus writes 
to Barbarossa, pirate prince of Algiers : " The 
sun envies you because the glory of the fame 
which crowns you with eternal praise goes into 
those parts of the world where the light of the 
flame which he offers cannot go . " Henry VIII. 's 
liberality is rewarded by similar grandiloquence 
of praise. An instance of Aretino's failure of 
reward is afforded in Michaelangelo's admirable 
indifference to his request for some sketches ; 
but the great artist was punished by a seriously 
phrased denunciation of the nudities in the 
" Last Judgment." 

In hiring himself out as a giver of immor- 
tality, Aretino illustrates the " common weak- 
ness of the men of that day, an insatiable desire 
for fame." His own words best express this 
"characteristic passion of the age": " I do not 
know the pleasures misers feel in the sound of 
the gold they count, but I know well that the 
blessed spirits do not hear music which is more 
gratefid than the harmony that comes out of 
one's own praises. One feeds on it as in Para- 
dise the souls feed on the vision of God." 

As a writer, Aretino was prolific and ver- 
satile. His works include comedies, obscene 
sonnets, and pornographic dialogues which he 
maintained were " a warning to virtue and an 
exposure of vice." His religious writings in- 
clude a life of Christ and the lives of several 
mediaeval saints. Presumably he wrote about 
six thousand letters, of which more than half 
have survived. It is, of course, in these that 
Professor Van Dyke has found his best material 
for exhibiting Aretino's curious personality. 

To portray personality is the supreme task 
of the biographer's art. To gather and judge 



facts is one thing ; it is quite another to frame 
them fitly into an individuality, so tliat a 
reader of ordinary imagination may receive a 
trustworthy impression of the character that is 
interpreted for him. The task is well-nigh 
baffling when the material at the biographer's 
disposal is practically void of the personal ele- 
ment. Such a difficulty opposes itself to the 
historian of Thomas Cromwell. About seven 
thousand letters and documents about him are 
calendared in the State Papers of Henry VIII. 's 
reign, but he has left us no personal record of 
his motives. Such is not the case with his great 
namesake and kinsman, Oliver. Professor Van 
Dyke's fresh and independent study of the great 
minister — based on a personal examination of 
these letters and state papers — is on the whole 
sympathetic and vindicatory. He believes that 
Cromwell was neither so incredibly bad as most 
of his contemporaries thought him to be, nor 
so great and good as, for instance, Froude's 
extravagant estimate woidd imply. He sees in 
Cromwell a man of the Renascence able to 
discern England's need of a strong national 
government, and strong enough to employ the 
truculent methods of the time in devising and 
executing a definite programme of reform. This 
programme embraced the overthrow of papal 
authority by making Henry VIII. supreme head 
of the church ; the displacing of the old ascetic 
and political ecclesiasticism by the protest-ideal ; 
and the final destruction of the declining feudal 
nobility. In thus centralizing the power of the 
sovereign, Cromwell employed and preserved 
the Parliamentary sanction. He strove to re- 
place the Old Learning by the New ; and hav- 
ing embittered the king by his attitude toward 
the distastefiil marriage with the German prin- 
cess, he fell a sudden victim of the courtly party, 
who were not only his personal enemies, but were 
unwilling to share his manifest sympathy for the 
transition of England from the mediaeval to the 
modem idea of the state. 

The essay on CromweU embodies the conclu- 
sions of Professor Van Dyke's criticism of Car- 
dinal Pole's portrait of Cromwell m the Apologia^ 
written in 1539 to urge Charles V. to invade 
England and " force it from schism to obedi- 
ence." This criticism, first published in the 
" American Historical Review," is reproduced 
in an appendix to the volume. In it, Professor 
Van Dyke presents an elaborate and fairly sat- 
isfactory argument to disprove Pole's contention 
that Cromwell's diabolism was inspired by Ma- 
cliiavelli's II Principe. Cromwell's portrait in 
Fox's Book of Martjrrs, as a " Martyr of the

Gospel," is likewise shown to be untrustworthy. 
Both estimates were outgrowths of the violent 
polemic spirit which attended the breaking up 
of the old conditions in England to make place 
for the new. 

The essay on Alaximilian I. affords a schol- 
arly and readable illustration of the crude con- 
ditions under which the German Renascence 
moved forward. An account of the inchoate 
political confederacy which was Germany's in- 
heritance from mediaevalism forms a clearly- 
sketched background for the author's portrait 
of the picturesque but inefficient Hapsburg em- 
peror. Although much care had been given to 
his education, Maximilian shared but little of 
the real humanistic spirit, and was thoroughly 
mediaeval as a ruler. This aspect Professor Van 
Dyke makes clearer than most \s'riters on the 
Renascence in Germany. Maximilian gave some 
encouragement to the universities, and possessed 
a passion for art : he even found time for such 
literary composition and dictation as his Haps- 
burg pride was capable of ; but the material for 
the four allegorical works for which he is directly 
or indirectly responsible — Weisskunig. Teuer- 
dank. The Triimiphed Arch, and The Triumphal 
Procession — savor of the medifeval rather than 
of the modem taste. He manifested no intelli- 
gent interest in the Reformation. He failed to 
recognize the awakening national consciousness 
of his people, and their growing aspiration for 
reform in church and state. The inherited fan- 
tasy of the Holy Roman Empire fed his thirst 
for personal distinction and family aggrandize- 
ment, and blinded him to the demands of his 
time for a stronglv-organized internal adminis- 
tration of authority. He was happiest when 
hunting, dancing, or leading an army upon some 
foreign conquest. He had no taste for construc- 
tive statesmanship, and was a complete failure 
in matters of finance. The Renascence forces 
slowly gathering were his opportunity to become 
the national leader of a people evidently moving 
toward modernism in its ideals. But whatever 
interest he had in his patronage of Renascence 
tendencies '• grew fix)m the hope of presenting 
his figure to posterity as the greatest member 
of the glorious house of Hapsburg, and illus- 
trating the lessons of his example to descendants 
who might raise the dynasty to the heights of 
power where his day-dreams had placed it." 

Of American historians, Professor Van Dyke 
has given us the most important contribution to 
the literature of the Renascence. ^\Tiat in his 
earlier work he did for the general reader, he 
has done in these '" Renascence Portraits " for 



the student. It is a book that will be read with 
much satisfaction and profit by everyone inter- 
ested in the great transition movement from 

mediaeval to modem life, x i? t>^^^.c^^.

Oxj) Egtt»t to the Fkoxt.* 



Napoleon opened Old Egjrpt to the modem 
world. His discovery of the Rosetta Stone, in 
1799, was one of the two permanent and bene- 
ficial results of his Egyptian campaign. For it 
was by the decipherment of that unique docu- 
mentary relic of antiquity that Champollion and 
other decipherers introduced to us the Ancient 
Egyptians. Explorers, excavators, archaeolo- 
gists, linguists and historians have been unroll- 
ing their history for nearly a century. Temples, 
tombs, pyramids and papyri have almost poured 
their treasures into the laps of those laborers. 
Every season's work is filled with surprises; 
every new campaign of exploration and excava- 
tion yields some results that help bridge the 
chasm between the known and vmknown in the 
long stretch of Egyptian time. The wealth and 
abundance of the material gathered during the 
last century have increased with every decade. 
Its scope has included history, science, religion, 
poHtics, and social customs. Time and again 
scholars have prepared, on the basis of discover- 
ies, elaborate treatises, discussions, and extended 
histories of that great Oriental people. But 
the new facts found even in one decade require 
another re-casting and re-Avriting to be commen- 
surate with our newly discovered knowledge. 

Professor Breasted, whose previous work in 
this field has entitled him to distinction, has had 
excellent advantages and opportimities to make 
the most thorough preparation for the writing

sion of the very best material available. That 
he might utilize to the fullest extent the latest 
improvements and results of research, he per- 
sonally translated the entire body of known 
Egyptian inscriptions ; and these translations are 
now appearing in four volumes from the Uni- 
versity of Chicago Press. This material forms 
the basis of his present " History of Egypt." 

The entire sweep of time covered by the vol- 
ume stretches from 4241 B. C. to 525 B. C, 
or from the introduction of the calendar year, 
" the earliest fixed date in the history of the 
world," down to the conquest of Egypt by the 
Persians. This period of time is discussed under 
eight books, — 1, Introduction; 2, The Old 
Kingdom ; 3, The Middle Kingdom, The Feudal 
Age ; 4, The Hyksos, The Rise of the Empire ; 
5, The Empire, First Period ; 6, The Empire, 
Second Period ; 7, The Decadence ; 8, The Resto- 
ration and the End. The most startling discover- 
ies of the last decade fall within the scope of the 
first two books. Histories of Egypt written more 
than ten years ago began authentic history after 
the time of the reputed Menes. " Menes the 
Good," the foimder of Memphis, was said, in 
1894, by Professor Maspero (" DaAvn of Civili- 
zation," p. 234) to have owed " his existence 
to a popidar attempt at etymology." Again he 
says, " The two Thinite dynasties, in direct 
descent from the fabulous Menes, furnish, like 
this hero himself, only a tissue of romantic tales 
and miracidous legends in the place of history " 
(p. 237). At this date, however, we not only 
know that Menes was a historical character, but 
we have an abundance of his personal effects — 
some of which may be seen in the HaskeU 
Oriental Museum of the University of Chicago. 
More than this. Professor Petrie's excavations 
have produced evidence of the existence of sev- 
eral kings who rided previous to the establish- 
ment of the so-called first dynasty. These finds 
have pushed back the historical beginning of 
Egypt more than seven hundred years, even on 
the basis of the calendar year introduced in 
4241 B. C. 

The third book, on " The Middle Kingdom," 
contains some new material, though less than 
the first two books. The feudal age is described 
with ample fvdness as that in which the empire 
finally expanded and began to reach beyond its 
ancient boundaries and to aspire to the position 
of world rulers. On the Hyksos period, treated 
in the fourth book, we have next to no new light. 
Josephus, some fragments of antiquities, and an 
occasional reference or hint, constitute the bulk 
of our sources for an accoimt of that Asiatic 



domination of the Nile Valley which stretches 
over 208 years of time. But the historian is 
at his best in treating the XVIIIth and XlXth 
dynasties — The Empire. Here we have a 
plethora of information touching almost every 
phase of Egyptian life. The discoveries of the 
last decade have given us a new conception of the 
glory of the XVIIIth dynasty. The uncovering 
of the Der el Bahri temple of Queen Hatshepsut 
has unlocked many of the mysteries of that 
remarkable woman's power and reign. The 
relations of the XlXth dynasty to Asia and to 
the Hittites constitutes one of the chief inter- 
ests of that period. To Rameses II. and to his 
tremendous energy in erecting monuments are 
due the vivid pictures that we have of that epoch. 
Professor Breasted has sho^vn remarkable 
skill in weaving together the scattered fragments 
of information that we possess covering the 
whole period of his treatment ; and the result is 
a vigorous, popidar, and highly interesting narra- 
tive account — even though sometimes severely 
condensed — of the political, religious, and social 
life of the ancient Egyptians. The type used 
in the volume is large and clear, and the text is 
not burdened with references — these appearing 
as footnotes. The volume is rather profusely 
illustrated with half-tones and etchings of scenes 
and antiquities that are connected directly with 
the narrative. Another edition shoidd correct 
these errors : Figure 26, opposite page 42, is 
upside down ; map 11, page 444, is also inverted ; 
a few misprints, as " called " for " call," line 9 
from bottom of page 80, and " born " for 
' ' borne , " line 8 , page 123. The publishers have 
done their part excellently, but they should give 
a book of this weight a firmer binding. 

Professor Flinders Petrie is now the Nestor 
among active living excavators. He has dug out 
of the tombs and tumuli of Egypt a vast amount 
of antiquities, that have proved to be new chap- 
ters in the history of Old Egypt. His skill, 
both as an excavator and an Egyptian scholar, 
has given him the advantage of being able to 
utilize his discoveries at once. His work in the 
present volume reveals an exhaustive knowledge 
of the antiquities, including inscriptions, of Old 
Egypt. But the narrative is not popidar in 
character. It is rather a complete index of every 
known historical monument that belongs to the 
XlXth and succeeding dynasties through the 
XXXth, with a careful and scholarly estimate 
of its character and contents. The atmosphere 
of the book is studious and learned. It requires 
patient, thoughtful, concentrated effort to read

it and get out of it the best that it contains. It 
is not history in the popular sense of that term, 
but is rather a chronological arrangement of the 
materials out of which a running narrative could 
be constructed. As a compendiimi, it is inval- 
uable to the scholar. The book Ls well illustrated 
by 155 beautiful reproductions of seals, statues, 
monuments, and inscriptions, belonging to the 
period that it covers. The first two voliunes of 
the series to which Professor Petrie's work be- 
longs appeared several years ago, and brought 
the history down to the close of the X^^IIth 
dynasty. The present volume carries us down 
through the XXXth dyna.sty. The succeeding 
volumes of the series are to be on Ptolemaic 
Egypt, by Professor J. P. Mahaify ; Roman 
Egypt, by Mr. J. G. MUne : and Arabic Egypt, 
by Dr. Stanley Lane Poole. 

Professor Georg Steindorff , of the University 
of Leipzig, delivered, in the spring of last year, 
the fifth course of lectures in the " American 
Lectures on the History of Religions." A spe- 
cialist himself, and dealing with his material at 
first-hand, he gives us his own interpretation of 
the phenomena of religion as he finds them in the 
monuments of Egypt. There were no peoples 
in antiquity which were more deeply religious 
than were the Egj^tians. It permeated their 
actions and controlled their conduct. The mass 
of religious ritual, amidets, charms, divinities, 
temples, are but the externals of the thoughts 
and beliefs that swayed their lives. The abund- 
ance of religious texts that now speak to vis of 
their thoughts are relatively meagre in definite 
information. In the earliest times, we find local 
divinities on the one hand and cosmic beings on 
the other, standing at an infinite distance from 
man. As time went on, these two became blended 
by theological speculation ; and from that com- 
bination we discover an almost new religion. 
The sim-god (Atum) of On or Heliopolis was 
the first divinity to enter into special relations 
with the hiunan race, and to receive special wor- 
ship. By a process of reasoning, the sun-god 
that soared in the heavens was regarded as one 
and the same in essence as he. In a similar 
manner, they everywhere united local deities and 
cosmic beings until there was evolved a unique 
religion. But the most striking element in the 
Egyptian religion was their conception of life 
after death. This idea modified not only their 
whole lives, but shows itself in all their funeral 
customs, and in their elalx)rate tombs and burial- 
places. The l>elief in the transmigration of souls 
likewise permeated all their ideas of the here- 



after. Professor SteindorfF's lectures are com- 
paratively comprehensive of all the light we have 
on Egyptian religion, set forth in popular and 
readable but distinctly scholarly terms. 

We are extremely fortunate to receive from 
the press the sources of Professor Breasted's 
" History of Egypt " in his " Ancient Records 
of Egypt." This latter work is appearing in four 
volumes, three of which are already out, and will 
present in translations aU the known historical 
documents from the earliest times to the Persian 
conquest. The author has wisely introduced his 
translations by discussing, in the initial volume, 
with sufficient detail, the documentary sources 
of Egyptian history and the chronology ; and he 
has also included therein a chronological table. 

The first volume embraces the material from 
the first to the seventeenth dynasties. The 
earliest date said to be fixed in Egyptian history 
is 4241 B. C, the time of the introduction of 
the Egyptian calendar. Under this scheme, 
Menes, the first king of the first dynasty, began 
to rule 3400 B. C, and succeeding dynasties 
and reigns follow in such order that each can be 
almost exactly dated. This fact gives great 
satisfaction to the student of history. Thence 
through this volume the author gives under sepa- 
rate sections a translation of each little inscrip- 
tion of each year, so far as found, of each king's 
reign. In some places the section is almost bar- 
ren, because of lack of material or of its broken 
character. To make the matter more significant. 
Professor Breasted describes each inscription 
before translating it, and in footnotes gives 
textual remarks or references so that the reader 
may verify his statements. 

Volume II. presents translations of all the 
known inscriptions of the eighteenth dynasty 
— one of the two most productive periods of 
Egyptian history. This large volume is replete 
with the marvellous documents of the reigns of 
Thutmose III. and his half-sister queen. We 
can trace through these inscriptions the won- 
derfid seventeen campaigns of Thutmose, as he 
sweeps the plains of Western Asia and makes his 
influence felt over in the Mesopotamian Valley. 
We can also trace in outline the steps by which 
the religion of Western Asia invaded the sacred 
precincts of the gods of the Nile, and possibly, 
in a later age, contributed to the overthrow of 
that powerful dynasty. 
I The third volume deals likewise with a single 
dynasty, the nineteenth. The largest contribu- 
j tions to our knowledge of any one monarch of 
i this dynasty are the known records of Rameses

II. The number of wars, conquests, temples, 
statues, and palaces of that monarch are almost 
incredible. With an indomitable energy he 
perpetuated his name and fame in almost every 
available space in Egypt. These translations, 
as none before, convince the reader of the vast 
significance of his career in the history of that 
period. 

Such source-books are invaluable to the stu- 
dent of Egyptian history, and serve as the chief 
basis of the popular work reviewed above.

Thepersonaiuv ''The True Andrew Jackson," by 
of Andrew Mr. Cyrus Townsend Brady, is the 

Jackson. seventh of the series of " True Biog- 

raphies" (Lippincott). Like the other volumes of 
the series, this one aims simply to present a per- 
sonality, and not to furnish a complete life with a 
discussion of the military and political events of the 
time in which the subject lived. The topics treated 
will exhibit the compass of the work : Jackson's 
family and his early life ; Jackson as lawyer, planter, 
soldier, politician ; his manners and personal appear- 
ance ; his devotion to mother and wife, his respect 
for women and kindness to children ; his pugnacity, 
his patriotism, his duels and quarrels. The book is 
well illustrated, and the. appendix contains a paper 
on the birthplace of Jackson by Mr. A. S. Salley, Jr., 
of South Carolina, some nullification documents, 
Jackson's farewell address, and his last will and 
testament. A usefid chronology is also given. Mr. 
Brady has evidently made use of all available ma- 
terial in print, and in constructing his account he 
has drawn heavily upon former biographers of " Old 
Hickory " — Parton, Buell, Sumner, Colyar, and 
Brown, besides the general historians who deal 
with the Jacksonian period, such as Roosevelt, Peck, 
and Schouler. From these sources have been drawn 
anecdotes, opinions, estimates, so numerous that the 
reviewer is tempted to assert that not a single in- 
teresting one has escaped. And here is one fault 
of the book : — there is too much quotation, and 
the result is too much like a scrap-book. We are 
glad to have the stories and opinions of Jackson's 
contemporaries, but there is no need of an array of 
estimates from Mr. Brady's contemporaries. Mr. 
Brady has made a closer study of Jackson than most 
of the recent authorities quoted by him, and his 
judgment, not theirs, should have been given. Many 
of these extracts are practically duplicates ; too many 
of them are not labelled as to source. The historical 
structure is unusually sound, in this respect the work 
ranking among the best of the series. The author 
has a correct conception of the forces at work in the 
West, and has rightly estimated the importance of 
Jackson's environment in relation to his career in 



war and politics. There is a tendency toward hero- 
worship — a slight Jacksonian disposition to under- 
rate Jackson's opponents ; but this is useful to offset 
such unfriendly accounts as that of Sumner, whom 
our author handles without gloves. In view of Mr. 
Brady's understanding of the Southwestern frontier 
spirit of expansion, we hardly expect to find him say- 
ing that as a result of the battle of New Orleans, " to 
Andrew Jackson is due the vital fact that the western 
boundary of the United States is the Pacific and 
not the Mississippi "; also, understanding Andrew 
Jackson as he does, he should be able to explain hi» 
hero's attitude toward the annexation of Texas, — 
" oiu* national iniquity," as he calls it, seemingly 
unmindfid of oiu* later and far greater transgressions. 
But in spite of such defects as those noted, the book 
is a live and interesting one ; the author's method 
and his love for his subject have made it the most 
readable life of Jackson since Parton's, and it has 
the advantage of Parton's in being shorter. 

Lives of two Edyard Grieg is probably the most 
living masters eminent of living composers — pace 
of music. Camille Saint-Saens ; and although 

he has reached his " grand climacteric," being sixty- 
three this year, curiously enough no connected 
account of his life and personality and works has 
been written in English. His countless admirers will 
therefore welcome the compact little biography con- 
tributed to the " Living Masters of Music " series 
(John Lane) by Mr. Henry T. Finck, the well-known 
musical critic. Its 130 pages contain just what one 
would most wish to know about the Norwegian mas- 
ter — his childhood, education, originality of genius, 
and relation to other composers ; together with vari- 
ous photographs, f ac-similes of music, and a complete 
bibliography by opus numbers of all his compositions 
to date. It is not generally known that Grieg is of 
Scottish descent — pretty well back ; and that the 
name originally was Greig, as it is so often misspelled 
now. Mr. Finck's admiration for his musical heroes 
is hard to restrain within moderate limits ; it is like 
Mr. Swinburne talking of Marlowe, or Victor Hugo 
when he says of Solvejg's Cradle Song in " Peer 
Gynt," "I would not give it for all the songs of 
Brahms, Hugo, Wolf, and Richard Strauss, put to- 
gether. The creative thrill of delight which Grieg 
must have felt when he penned the last twelve bars 
of this song — which have not their equal in more 
than twelve other songs ever composed — surely 
atoned for all the disappointments of his life." This 
is pretty strong ; but, for all that, the book is a sound 
and sympathetic study of this great son of the North. 
— Another interesting book in the same series is the 
sketch of Theodor Leschetizky, the great Viennese 
teacher of the piano, by Miss Annette HxiUah. Of 
Bohemian and Polish parentage, Leschetizky was 
musically endowed from birth, and as a Wunderkind 
made the usual sensation by his public performances 
at the age of nine. At fourteen he began to take 
pupils himself ; and ever since then — for more than 
sixty years — he has been beset by eager students

from all parts of the world. The story of this con- 
centrated career is well and clearly told hy Miss 
Hullah, who makes the discriminating point that 
Leschetizky is emphatically an individualist in his 
work : " Less philanthropic than his friend Rubin- 
stein, he has preferred to work in a smaller field. 
He would devote himself heart and soul to watching 
and tending the unfolding of any young talent, but 
not to the education of the masses ; and it is well 
that it is so, for otherwise a specialist would have 
been lost to the world. His chief care was that each 
pupU entrusted to him should develop to the best of 
his abilitj' ; if pianism in general incidentally bene- 
fited by the system of study he had built up, so 
much the better." 

The deadlv " ^* ^* ^^^ S^^^^ ^^^ t^^ legalized strife 

w€uteof for gold," says Mr. Sidney C. Reeve, 

competition. u ^hich is the root of all evil." The 
institution of '• barter " and the resultant " competi- 
tive system " have indeed many sins to answer for, 
if all be true that this author says throughout the 
six hundred pages of '• The Cost of Competition " 
(McOure, PhiUips & Co.). The first half of the 
book treats the economic cost, in contradistinction 
to the ethical cost, and the future of competition. 
That economics, as a science, is as yet in a very crude 
stage of development, is sadly impressed upon the 
reader, who cannot forbear wishing that writers on 
this subject would adopt a standard terminology, 
and in so doing omit new definitions whose distinc- 
tions from old ones are apt to seem arbitrary and 
are certainly confusing. Mr. Reeve, however, start- 
ing with his own definitions, builds up a perfectly 
consistent system of economics, pointing out, by 
means of statement and diagram, the waste of pro- 
ductive energj' in the present system of exchange. 
His arguments are convincingly stated, and perhaps 
the only barrier to the reader's conviction is the 
absence of statistical proof, which the author depre- 
cates as " the weakest method of all." In the second 
part of the book, Mr. Reeve estimates the ethical 
cost of competition, and its effect, especially upon 
the community'. This cost, he would lead us to be- 
lieve, is so tremendous that half-way reforms are 
futile, and the only remedy is the adoption of co- 
ordination and communitj'-ownership of all value 
produced. This economic transformation he confi- 
dently predicts for the near future : it is, indeed, 
the only hope of a man who says that he is "pal- 
pably, absolutely sure that all want, the great bulk 
of all crime, and an enormous proportion of all sin, 
sorrow, and ugliness, are the inevitable fruit of a 
single artificial and irremediable but indestructible 
institution : Barter." Hence all nature, it would seem 
to us, escapes without its share of responsibility in 
this indictment ; and we cannot agree ■with 31r. Reeve 
to the extent of believing that economic forces are 
the only sources of ethical results. •• The Cost of 
Competition " is written with all the zeal of a mis- 
sionar}', and upholds the cause of socialism with 
vigor and earnestness. 



There are limits to the appetite of 
'm^ocUnas." *^^." *^^ greediest devourer of me- 
moirs and letters. Why Mrs Emily J. 
Climenson, the '' great-great-niece " of Mrs. Elizabeth 
Montagu, " Queen of the Blue-Stockings," should 
feel called upon to issue two large volumes (which 
bear the imprint of Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.) of 
that lady's correspondence, when we have at least 
five volumes already, is not apparent to one who is 
neither a Robinson nor a Montagu. False dates in 
some of the Montagu letters published by the present 
editor's grandfather, Baron Rokeby, have been cor- 
rected ; but exactly how many of the letters in this 
collection are here printed for the first time, one 
could tell only by a laborious comparison of Mrs. 
Climenson's pages with Lord Rokeby's, and with 
perhaps a dozen other publications containing por- 
tions, large or small, of Mrs. Montagu's correspond- 
ence, — and the game is not worth the candle, or, 
in this case, the midnight oil and the strain on the 
eyes. We are told that if all the letters were pub- 
lished they would fill a large bookcase; so that 
presumably many fresh pages are here opened to 
the reader. Not a few letters to Mrs. Montagu are 
also included, and the interspersed narrative matter 
and accompanying footnotes are all that could be 
expected of a painstaking editor. She hopes, if life 
is spared her, to continue her labors at some future 
time, pausing here with the year 1761, thirty-nine 
years before her distinguished kinswoman's death. 
As a portrait gallery, the volumes are attractive, 
with their twent}'-f our reproductions from Reynolds, 
Lawrence, Opie, Hogarth, Hudson, and other artists ; 
and to the genealogical enthusiast the opening pages 
of family historj-, and the large folder showing the 
Robinson pedigree, will prove choice reading. Of 
Mrs. Montagu's acknowledged merits as a letter- 
writer — despite Dr. Johnson's poor opinion of her 
intellectual equipment — it is unnecessary here to 
say anything. 

Education at Through the translation — acceptable 
the German though not masterly — of Professor 
univertttie*. Paulsen's comprehensive volume upon 
"German Universities" (Scribner), a significant 
contribution to the American's knowledge of Grer- 
man education has been rendered accessible. The 
book presents an adequate historical survey of the 
development of the German universities, — a story 
that on the whole shows how few of the essential 
characteristics of these seats of learning are properly 
ascribed to their age. Modern education is as mod- 
ern in one countrj- as another ; and the American 
who takes comfort for the deficiencies of Amer- 
ican universities by leaving their shortcomings to 
their youth is resting his judgment upon illusive sup- 
port. An account of the modern characteristics of 
a German universitj- is followed by a detailed ac- 
count of the spirit and methods of university instruc- 
tion, by an equally careful rSsumS of the student life,, 
and by a less pertinent (to American readers) ac- 
count of the ways and purposes of the several facul-

ties. While useful and authoritative, the volume is 
not wholly suited to English i-eaders, and suggests 
that a book specially written for their needs would be 
a more efficient means of promoting an acquaintance 
and a comprehension of German universities than 
is afforded by this translation. Professor Paulsen's 
critical and painstaking analyses of points and argu- 
ments that appeal only to the German in his more 
technical moods mar the perspective of the work for 
the American reader. At the same time, they serve 
to present the perspective of importance to the Ger- 
man mind, and empliasize the great differences of 
problem and point of view that the educational stu- 
dents of the two countries have to face. The trans- 
lation is welcome, but does not lessen the need for a 
volume that shall present the story of the German 
universities in a way adapted to the American point 
of view and to the American interests. 



Fragments of '^« understand the career of anyone 
an actress's who has exerted a marked influence 

autobior/raphy. upon art or science, it is necessary 
not only to have some sympathy with that person, 
but still more to understand the circumstances and 
conditions which made his or her career and influ- 
ence possible. In the autobiographical sketch of her 
life, Mrs. Clara Morris Harriott has appealed to a 
sympathetic audience by dedicating her work to 
" those women Avho tasted sorrow and defeat before 
they won success." " The Life of a Star " (McClure, 
Phillips & Co.) is made up of a collection of short 
articles, reprinted from various periodicals ; they por- 
tray the dignity of the actor's art, with its difficulties, 
its uses, and its triumphs. Personal reminiscences 
of many persons famous in art, literature, and politics 
are interspersed. Fragmentary views of McKinley 
and Garfield, gained from personal acquaintance, 
are here made no less interesting than the anecdotal 
sketches of Salvini, Rachel, or Dion Boucicaidt. 
The author's own histrionic invasion of the metrop- 
olis, her crucial moments in critical Boston, her ad- 
ventures en route, suggest, as she intimates, one 
of those small kaleidoscopes wherein these short 
sketches become the bits of colored glass — '' green 
for hope, blue for faith, red for courage, purple for 
power." This record of the thoughts, fancies, sen- 
timents and reflections of a good and talented woman 
is commendable alike for the grace, purity, simplicity 
and expressiveness of its diction, its apt and oft- 
times felicitous collocation of words and plrrases, and 
the easy flow of its style. It will bear comparison 
with some of the best of similar work by authors of 
acknowledged rank in literatm-e. 

Catherine ^he story of the gi-eat Empress 

of Russia, Catherine is retold in two substantial 

and her court. volumes by Mr. Fitzgerald MoUoy, 
in " The Russian Com-t in the Eighteenth Century " 
(imported by Charles Scribner's Sons). It is the 
narrative of a career as strange and astonishing as 
any to be found in the annals of history. This 
princess of a little German state, who was brought 



into Russia to be the consort of the stupid heir to 
Elizabeth's throne, by her force of will and magnetic 
personality made herself absolute mistress of the 
great Russian Empire, casting off her unspeakable 
husband and drawing to her support the nobility 
and the masses as she proved her power to rule. She 
practised unbridled and open licentiousness ; but 
inasmuch as in that barbarous court licentiousness 
was common, she maintained her sway and proved 
herself to be a great ruler and state-builder, one of 
the great rulers of modern history. Mr. MoUoy's 
work does not contain a narrative of political events, 
but rather the personal narrative of Catherine's life 
and of the lives of those with whom she was asso- 
ciated as Grand Duchess and Empress. We see 
the procession of handsome favorites on whom she 
lavished affection and wealth to the end of her life ; 
the venal and cruel courtiers ; the Empress Eliza- 
beth who preceded her, her husband, and the base 
son who followed her. And we find incidentally 
set forth the motives, mainly personal, that led to 
Russia's various intei'ventions in European affairs 
during the latter half of the eighteenth century, 
and to the great scheme of Catherine's later life, the 
Partition of Poland. The whole story is of absorb- 
ing interest to one Avho would watch the play of 
the elemental passions either in individual relations 
or in a barbaric state. The work is illustrated with 
many fine portraits.

specialized a volume as Mr. Rhead's " The Basses, 
Fresh- Water and Marine" (Stokes). Even those 
who usually find the printed page of little avail, 
either for inspiration or instruction, wUl do well to 
make an exception in this case, for the editor-author 
has succeeded not only in telling " how, when, and 
where to fish for bass," but in giving the reader an 
intimate acquaintance with the history, habits, and 
distribution of the various species. The basis of the 
descriptions is carefully scientific, but science serves 
mostly as a point of departure, and the " pleasing 
vicissitudes of angling " receive due attention. The 
book represents a division of labor, the chapters on 
the fresh-water basses having been wi'itten by the 
late Mr. William C. Harris, and those on the marine 
basses being contributed by Mr. Tarleton H. Bean, 
while the editor himself adds interesting reminis- 
cences and practical suggestions. Colored plates of 
the basses, and of artificial flies, have informing 
value, though most of the illustrations serve for 
general attractiveness rather than accurate exposi- 
tion. To the actual fisherman, the chapters on baits, 
flies, and artificial lures will be most serviceable ; 
while to others the story of the marine basses will 
perhaps be most engaging, for the spice of rather 
rare adventure in it. A satisfactory feature of the 
book is the credit given the United States Fish Com- 
mission for the successful stocking of many waters 
with this typically American fish.

A handbook of The small volume by Mr. Rossiter 

the ComtUulion y , ...■. j , rr,, o, « .\ 

of the United Johnson entitled '• Ihe btory of the 
states. Constitution" (New York: William 

Ritchie ) seems to be a miniature reduction of the 
principal facts in the first part of a constitutional 
history of the United States. It is not such a critical 
study as the volumes of a similar title by Stevens, 
Campbell, and other investigfators, but rather a sum- 
mary or outline. The chapters deal with the for- 
mation and failure of the Articles of Confederation, 
the incidents of the Convention and its work, the 
ratification by States, and a sketch of the amend- 
ments. In the introduction, the author hints that 
neither the '• inspired " theory nor the inheritance 
from England explains the origin of the Constitu- 
tion ; but he nowhere lifts the veil. The only novel 
feature of the sketch is a summary of " what might 
have been," describing the proposals that failed of 
adoption in the Convention. Defects exist in the 
frame of national government, according to the au- 
thor, in the discrepancies of divorce laws in the vari- 
ous States, in the veto power, which is " a remnant 
of kingly prerogative," and in the ease with which 
a State may alter its constitution after admission to 
the Union — whereas its admission should be in the 
nature of a contract. The accustomed official docu- 
ments take up a large portion of the volume. The 
work may serve as a handbook for students or as a 
convenient manual for the general public. 

A hopeful view ^^ " ^he Country Town : A Study of 
of the future of Rural Evolution" (Baker & Taylor 
the countrv town. Q^ ) j^^ WUbert L. Anderson takes 
an optimistic view of the future of rural communi- 
ties, though by no means ignoring the unfortunate 
tendencies which have been emphasized by other 
^vriters. He has read widely and thought deeply on 
the subject, and on many other subjects in so far as 
they affect his theme ; but though he cites numerous 
authorities, he writes in the graceful stj'le of the 
essajTst. While recognizing that tendencies are at 
work which, unchecked, would ruin all rural com- 
munities, he relies upon the power of children to be 
better than their fathers, and upon the innate virtue 
of the rural environment to make up for the migra- 
tion of the more progressive elements of the popula- 
tion to the cities. There is a philosophical vagueness 
about the proposals for conscious improvement, and 
the author seems to under-estimate the value of such 
a definite movement for the betterment of rural 
conditions as the revival of old-time handicrafts. 
Much is made of the " indissoluble partnership " 
between country and cit}\ 



JfOTES. 



"The Title-Mart," a comedy in three acts by Mr. 
Winston Churchill, is published in book form by the

Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. 



" Elements of Political Science," by Professor Stephen 
Leacock, is a text-book for the use of high schools and 
colleges, just published by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin

" Francisco de Goya," by Mr. Richard Muther, is

A practical manual of " English Composition," suit- 
able for school use, and helpful for writers out of school, 
is the work of Mr. Hammond Lamont, and is published 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

" The Education Question," being a series of four

question of the hour in English politics, is a pamphlet 
publication of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" The Foundations of the Republic," by the Rev. 
Edward Everett Hale, is a small volume published by 
Messrs. James Pott & Co. Its contents are two lectures 
given of recent years before the Brooklyn Institute. 

Four new volumes in the " pocket edition " of Sir 
George Meredith's writings are now sent us by the 
Messrs. Scribner. " The Egoist," " Harry Richmond," 
" Rhoda Fleming," and " Beauchamp's Career " are the 
titles. 

Good translations are rare, but among their small 
number we must surely reckon Laf cadio Hearn's version 
of " The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard," that charming 
masterpiece of M. Anatole France. This delightful 
book now comes to us from Messrs. Harper & Brothers 
in a new edition. 

" The Literary History of the English People," by 
M. J. J. Jusserand, French ambassador to the United 
States, will shortly appear under the Putnam imprint. 
This second part — the first of the two volumes which 
it comprises — covers a period extending from the 
Renaissance to the Civil War. 

" Harper's Novelettes " is a new series of voltimes of 
short stories to be edited by Messrs. W. D. Howells and 
H. M. Alden. The first volume is called " Under the 
Sunset," and includes ten tales of life in the far West 
by Mr. Janvier, Mr. Mighels, Mrs. Peattie, ]VIiss Chan- 
ning, and others. Apparently these stories are reprinted 
from " Harper's Magazine." 

A new edition of Mrs. Graskell's works will appear 
shortly imder the Putnam imprint. It will be named 
" The Knutsford Edition," and will be a " biographical " 
edition in the sense in which Mrs. Ritchie's edition of 
Thackeray is so called. The work upon it is being done 
under the editorial supervision of Dr. Adolphus W. 
Ward, Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. 

One of the most attractive school books that we have 
seen for a long time is the " Robert Louis Stevenson 
Reader," compiled by Catherine T. Bryce and published 
by the Messrs. Scribner. It is made up of selections 
from the " Child's Garden," with alternate chapters 
telling the story of each poem in simple prose. There 
is an illustration in color on nearly every page. 

Matthew Arnold's " Merope," with Mr. Robert 
Whitelaw's translation of the " Electra " of Sophocles, 
are brought together in a Uttle volume imder the edi- 
torship of Mr. John Churton Collins, who suppfies a 
lengthy and learued critical introduction. Mr. Collins 
also stands sponsor for an edition of Dr. H. Kynaston's 
translation of the " Alcestis " of Euripides. Both books 
are published by Mr. Henry Frowde at the Oxford 
Clarendon Press.

[J-uly 1, 



" The Temple Greek and Latin Classics," edited by 
Messrs. G. Lowes Dickinson and H. O. Meredith, are 
a new Dent series of reprints, published in this country 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. They present the 
original text faced by an English translation. The 
" Medea " and " Hippolytus " of Euripides, edited and 
translated by Mr. Sydney Waterlow, are given us in 
the initial volume of the series. 

Messrs. A. C. MeClurg & Co. will publish at once a 
new illustrated edition of the famous Canadian romance, 
" Wacousta," by Major John Richardson. The story 
is founded upon incidents connected with the attempt 
on Fort Detroit by the Indian chief Pontiac in the year 
1763, which gives it a special pertinency for Messrs. 
McClui'g & Co.'s list, as the same incidents are the basis 
of Mr. Randall Parrish's " A Sword of the Old Front- 
ier," published by them last Fall. 

" The Acorn," of wliich the first two numbers have 
been received, is a quarterly magazine of literature and 
art published in London at the Caradoc Press, and in 
this country by the J. B. Lippincott Co. Each number 
is a volume in substantial binding, which at once sug- 
gests " The Yellow Book " of fin de siecle fame. This 
suggestibn is still further emphasized by the contents, 
which, whether literary or artistic, strike the note of 
modernity. In fact, an essay " In Defence of Modei'nity " 
is a characteristic contribution to the first number. 
Budding geniuses furnish the contents, for the most 
part, but among well-known names we notice those 
of Messrs. Yeats, Chesterton, A. C. Benson, and John 
Todhunter.

KNOWLEDG E AN D WISDOM. 

" Knowledge comes but wisdom lingers." 
Tennyson understood the matter well enough, 
for he was one of the wisest of men. But the 
phrase, glibly quoted though it may be, prob- 
ably has little meaning for the majority of 
those who use it. To cocksure youth, in partic- 
ular, making confident pronouncement upon all 
things in heaven and earth, the distinction be- 



tween knowledge and wisdom can hardly exist, 
for vvisdom is of the years far beyond, when 
knowledge shall have been duly sifted and syn- 
thesized. And what passes for wisdom even to 
advanced age may be no more than that crystal- 
lized prejudice which is the intellectual founda- 
tion of most lives that are past their prime. 

Let us take a moment to inquire into this dis- 
tinction. We realize, of course, that all wisdom 
must be knowledge, and also that the proposition 
is not a convertible one. For knowledge ranges 
all the way from the baldly empirical statement 
of isolated facts to such generalizations as those 
that have made immortal the names of Newton 
and Darwin. With every step taken in the di- 
rection of rationalization, knowledge approaches 
wisdom more closely, and to that extent begins 
to partake of its character and share its dignity. 
Yet the attainment of a certain degree of intdl- 
lectual abstraction is not in itself enough to 
admit mere knowledge to the jealously-guarded 
courts of wisdom ; we have an instinctive feeling 
that other credentials are demanded, and an 
inquiry into their nature inevitably leads us to 
the realization that they should also be affected 
by a human interest. The profoundest and most 
completely-classified knowledge, as of the mathe- 
matician or the naturalist, may make a man 
learned, but need not make him wise ; it is the 
former term, rather than the latter, that is the 
more fitting for the Newtons and the Darwins, 
but we need have no hesitation in attributing wis- 
dom, using the word with the nicest sense of its 
value, to an Aristotle, or a Bacon, or a Goethe. 

We attribute wisdom to such men as these 
because, in the possession of highly specialized 
stores of knowledge, they have not been content 
with it for its own sake, but have been insistent 
in bringing it to bear upon the conduct of life. 
Their aphoristic utterances form a sort of frac- 
tional distillate of the rarer elements of their 
thought, and, whether expressed in prose or 
verse, impress us with the sense of their finality. 
Here, of course, the poets have a little the best 
of it, for they know how to add to a wise saying 
just that touch of beauty that is needed to make 
it forever memorable. Never was a criticism 
more just than was addressed by Jowett to 
Tennyson, saying : " Your poetry has an element 
of philosophy more to be considered than any 



28

regular philosophy in England." And never 
was a definition more profound than Words- 
worth's of poetry as " the breath and finer spirit 
of all knowledge, the impassioned expression 
which is in the coimtenance of all science." 

Much of the world's inheritance of wisdom is 
impersonal in its nature, not traceable to a defi- 
nite source, being the expression of racial rather 
than of individual consciousness. It flashes 
upon us from apologue and parable and proverb, 
which have no assignable origin save dim tra- 
dition, but are treasured from age to age for 
the universality of the thought they embody, 
making them no less applicable to our own lives 
than to those remote conditions which gave them 
birth. Every people has its store of such wis- 
dom as this, ranging from the dignity and au- 
thority of whatever scriptures it holds sacred to 
the homeliness of those practical maxims that 
oral transmission rather than the printed page 
serves to keep alive. This is the wisdom which, 
albeit with a certain admixture of superstition, 
is brought to bear upon us from the nursery 
upwards, and whispers its monitions in our eai- 
at all seasons and upon all occasions. It is 
perhaps the deepest of all wisdom, by virtue of 
the very fact that it has thus triumphantly borne 
the test of time, and approved itself to human 
intelligence under circumstances so numerous 
and so diverse. 

Those of us who have succumbed to civiliza- 
tion, however, enduring its inherent evils for 
the sake of the benefits which so manifestly out- 
weigh them, have also at our command the 
world of books, which means the recorded wis- 
dom of past generations and of our own which 
is even now passing. It is a bewildering maze, 
filled with the sound of many voices, their coun- 
sels sharply at variance, and their conflicting 
claims irreconcilable in any synthesis now ap- 
parent to the understanding. Yet something 
forbids us to exclaim, in Milton's phrase, 
" Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy," 
which is the refuge of indiff erentism ; something 
urgent within us impels to the quest of truth, 
no matter how laborious may be the tracking 
thereof. Nor, again quoting Milton, may we be 
content with the proposition which he thus 
words : 

" To know 

That which before us lies in daily life 

Is the prime wisdom." 

Or if this be " the prime wisdom " in a narrowly 
practical sense, it cannot suffice for the spiritual 
needs of beings of our " large discourse, looking 
before and after." We cannot stifle the im- 



perious cry of our nature for that deeper wis- 
dom which subsmnes our temporal existence 
under the species of eternity. 

Not to despair of truth, but to learn to know 
wisdom from its counterfeit, is the obligation 
laid upon every serious soul. There is in cir- 
culation much spurious coin of thought, and 
careless observation permits it a wide currency. 
In some cases the imitation is too obvious to 
deceive any who are not willing to be deceived ; 
in others the expert requires all his skill to dis- 
tinguish between the false and the true. How 
well we know the musty phrases to which sophis- 
try invariably has recourse when some wrong is 
to be defended or some lie varnished with the 
semblance of verity ! Let one of these phrases 
make its cunning appeal to some prepossession 
of ours, and the wrong is supported, the lie 
coimtenanced. Eternal vigilance is the price, 
not of liberty alone, but of intellectual and 
moral integrity. 

There is a type of mind for which the wisest 
precepts grow stale by repetition, and are even- 
tually spurned in favor of more piquant rivals. 
For the mind of this type the phrase-mongers 
ever lie in wait, their epigrams pointed by wit 
and baited with paradox. They acquire vogue 
by sheer audacity of utterance, and no truth is 
sacred enough to shame them from its denial. 
We need not specify, for modern instances will 
occur to every reader. But the mischief done 
by these smart philosophasters is considerable. 
They sap the ethical foundations of society, and 
sell their birthright for the pottage of a little 
applause. " As the crackling of thorns under a 
pot "— so were their antics described of old by 
one who was wise indeed. 

Wisdom receives its highest warrant from 
age and experience. Despite the scriptural tes- 
timony that it may come from the mouths of 
babes and sucklings, we are justified in viewing 
with suspicion any coinage of thought, however 
sharp its mintage, that cannot claim a respon- 
sible origin. Young's verse, 

" The man of wisdom is the man of years," 
is the statement of a truism, generally speaking, 
for no form of words may as such so bear the 
impress of authority as to dispense with the 
support of a weighty personality. Many a 
saying that is in itself without force or distinc- 
tion acquires both from the character of which 
it is the deliverance, and is given a higher power 
of energetic impact by the very name of its 
author. The man who has seen life from many 
angles and has upheld the standard of truth in 
many conflicts, the man who has been tested by

adversity and whose thought is the product of 
ripe reflection, is the man who may fitly claim 
our respect and confidence. 

But each new generation, as the scroll of 
time is unrolled for it, must work out its own 
salvation. The accumulated wisdom of the past 
is offered for our guidance, but something more 
than passive acceptance is reqvured of us. Ovir 
spiritual no less than our material inheritance 
must be earned anew if we woidd make it in 
very truth our own possession. New occasions 
bring new duties, and bring also new problems 
of conduct that for their solution tax our utmost 
powers. And specious counsels are ever whis- 
pered in the ears of youth, making the worse 
appear the better reason, and seeking to turn 
its gaze away from the old ethical landmarks. 
Si jeunesse savaitf But youth does not know, 
and from its very nature cannot know, many 
things of the highest import that are clear to the 
eyes of experience. So it pursues the old rovmd 
of foUy and disillusionment, of sin and expiation, 
slowly shaping itself in character and purpose. 
Wisdom is vindicated in the end, but the waste 
of the process seems pitiful. Yet this, too, is 
wisdom — to discern the educative value of the 
very faidts that come near to making shipwreck 
of life, and to realize that something more than 
counsels of perfection are required for the up- 
bidlding of the poised and full-statured soul.

POETRY A]^D TREES. 
(To the Editor of Tkk Dial.) 
I have just read with sympathetic pleasure the article 
on " Poetry and Arboriculture," in your issue of July 1. 
"Worthy to stand with anything that the poets have writ- 
ten about the trees, is Spenser's simple enumeration in 
the first book of the first canto of " The Faerie Queene " : 

" Much can they praise the trees so straight and hy. 
The saylinfir Pine ; the Cedar proud and tall ; 
The vine-propt Elme ; the Popplar nerer dry ; 
The builder Oake, sole krn£: of forrests all ; 
The Aspine, good for staves ; the Cypresse funerall ; 
The Laurell, meed of mightie conquerors 
And poets sage ; the Firre that weepeth still : 
The Willow, wome of forlome paramours ; 
The Eugh, obedient to the bender's will ; 
The Birch for shaftes ; the Sallow for the mill ; 
The Mirrhe, sweete-bleedlng in the bitter wound ; 
The warlike Beech ; the Ash for nothing ill ; 
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round ; 
The comer Holme ; the Maple seldom inward sound." 

A little instruction in some of the fimdamental prin- 
ciples of Forestry, with a wider acquaintance with what 
the great poets have said about the trees, would pro- 
duce more practical results, and would open the way to 
a great deal more of pleasure and profit, than many of 
the subjects that now absorb much of the time in our 
public schools. Geobge S. Wills.

liiFE OF '*The Arabian Kxight."* 



Good wine needs no bush. A good book 
needs no laudatory preface. The confident, al- 
most exulting, tone of Mr. Thomas Wright's in- 
troduction to his " Life of Sir Richard Burton " 
tends to prejudice the reader against what is 
to follow, " My revelations," declares the self- 
complacent author, " which form an astonishing 
story, will no doubt come as a complete surprise 
to almost everybody. I can imagine them, 
indeed, dropping like a bomb-shell into some 
circles." Bombastic prediction ! In the same 
strain is to be noted the following : 

" The amount of absolutely new information in this 
work is very large. Thtis, we are telling for the first 
time the history of Burton's friendships vrith Mr. F. F. 
Arbuthnot, Mr. John Payne, and others; and we are 
giving for the first time, too, a complete and accurate 
history of the translation of The Arabian Nights, The 
Scented Garden, and other works. Hundreds of new facts 
are recorded respecting these and other absorbing topics, 
while the citations from the impublished letters of Burton 
and Lady Burton will, we are sure, receive a welcome. 
We are able to give about fifty entirely new anecdotes 
— many of them extremely piquant and amusing. We 
also tell the touching story of Burton's brother Edward 
[who was diunb for the last forty years of his life] . In 
our account of Burton's travels will be found a number 
of interesting facts and some anecdotes not given in 
Burton's works." 

And yet, self-confidence and self-praise not- 
withstanding, the author has turned out a cred- 
itable piece of book-making. The story is not 
offered as the glowing tribute of an intimate and 
admiring friend, — in fact, there is no indication 
that the narrator ever even saw the subject of 
his narrative ; but the whole book bears such 
evidence of painstaking research, draws from so 
many sources hitherto neglected or unavailable, 
presents so many new facts and throws so much 
new light on the old ones, that it cannot be dis- 
missed as merely a pretentious piece of hack- 
work. Read the preface as an appendix, — and 
a preface, though first in the order of position, 
is always last in the order of creation, — and 
there is less fault to find with it. Its assertions 
are not outrageously extravagant, however un- 
fortunate their tone. Neither Mr. Hitchman in 
his detailed account of Burton the traveller and 
explorer, nor Lady Burton in her portly vol- 
umes of verbiage and slang and rhodomontade 
and indiscriminate panegyric, nor Miss Stisted 
in her shorter eulogistic sketch of her imcle's life, 
nor any other writer known to us, has so care-

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



fully weighed the claims of this man of varied 
talents and striking personality to be accounted 
also a great translator and man of letters. As 
it is in the treatment of Burton as a scholar 
and writer, rather than as a daring and resource- 
ful explorer, a speaker of many tongues, and an 
ardent anthropologist, that Mr. Wright's book 
offers something new to the general reader, it 
will here be fitting to confine our attention to 
these interesting " revelations," merely adding 
by the way that the story of his restless wan- 
derings, gathered chiefly from his own too- 
voluminous writings, is so well told as to make 
it difficult to point to a single dull page in the 
narrative. Sir Richard's fifty or more pub- 
lished volumes, prolix and ill-proportioned, have 
been squeezed and made to yield their juice for 
us in Mr. Wright's more scholarly pages. 

After giving a long list of his authorities for 
information never before divulged, the biog- 
rapher teUs of his success (the reward of per- 
sistent effort) in winning Mr. John Payne's 
consent to the publication of the true story 
concerning his own and Burton's " Arabian 
Nights." Some of these facts are already 
known to Arabic scholars who have critically 
examined the two versions. Intimate friends 
and zealous co-workers though these two men 
were. Burton seems to have been most strangely 
willing to take credit that was the other's due. 
He acknowledges indebtedness to Mr. Payne, 
but not in terms equal to the extent of his obli- 
gation. In the mere drudgery of translation, Mr. 
Wright makes it clear, by " deadly parallels," 
that his hero was not above " cribbing." Two of 
the shorter tales are printed in the two versions 
side by side, and they show a transference of 
whole clauses from the earlier to the later pub- 
lication. The biographer, " yielding to nobody in 
admiration of Sir Richard Burton," yet finds him- 
seK obliged to make the following admissions : 

"When I compared the two translations, page by 
page, I could scarcely believe my own eyes; and only 
one conclusion was possible. Burton, indeed, has taken 
from Payne at least three-quarters of the entire work. 
He has transferred many hundreds of sentences and 
clauses bodily. Sometimes we come upon a whole page 
with only a word or two altered. In short, amazing to 
say, the public have given Burton credit for a gift which 
he did not possess — that of being a great translator. 
... I must mention that Mr. Payne gave me an abso- 
lutely free hand — nay, more than that, having placed 
all the documents before me, he said — and this he 
repeated again and again — 'Wherever there is any 
doubt, give Burton the benefit of it,' and I have done so." 

" Amazing as the statement may seem, we feel our- 
selves compelled to say at once, though regfretfully, 
that Burton's own account of the history of the transla- 



tion, given in his Translator's Foreword to The Arabian 
Nights, and Lady Burton's accoimt, given in her life of 
her husband, do not tally with the facts as revealed in 
his letters. In matters relating to his own history. 
Burton often spoke with amazing recklessness, and 
perhaps he considered he was justified in stating that 
his translation of The Arabian Nights was well advanced 
by November 1881, seeing that it had for thirty years 
intermittently occupied his thoughts. As regards Lady 
Burton, no doubt, of some of the facts presently to be 
given, she was unaware. But she was one who easily 
deceived herself. Whatever she wished, she was apt 
to believe. The actual facts compiled from existing 
documentary evidence — including Burton's own letters 
— will now be revealed for the first time ; and it will 
be found, as is generally the case, that the unembroi- 
dered truth is more interesting than the romance." 

An instructive chapter deals with " The Fate 
of ' The Scented Garden.' " The biographer 
holds that the loss was chiefly a pecuniary one, 
to Lady Burton herself, who burned the manu- 
script, and that its publication would not have 
added to the translator's fame. An earlier ver- 
sion of all but the rare twenty-first chapter, 
from Burton's pen, had been published by the 
Kama Shastra Society, and apparently the mis- 
sing chapter had not been supplied in the later 
translation ; and such notes as Burton may have 
added are probably better lost. His fondness 
for the pornographic, and his firm conviction 
that researches in all the nameless forms of 
oriental vice make for the advancement of an- 
thropological science and of human welfare, 
can never cease to astound and even to dismay 
his admirers. Tndy his was a nature woven of 
mingled yam. In unsparing reprehension, his 
biographer writes : 

" Henceforth every translation was to be annotated 
from a certain point of view [as indicated in Burton's 
preface to his Catullus']. One can but regret this per- 
versity, for the old Roman and other authors have 
unpleasantnesses enough without accentuating them. 
. . . Unfortunately, Sir Richard now made this kind of 
work his speciality, and it would be idle — or rather it 
would be untrue — to deny that he now chose certain 
books for translation, not on account of their beautiful 
poetry and noble thoughts, but because they lent them- 
selves to pungent annotation. Indeed, his passion for 
this sort of literature had become a monomania. He 
insisted, however, and he certainly believed, that he was 
advancing the interests of science. We wish we could 
say that it was chiefly for their beauties that he now set 
himself to translate Catullus, Ausonius, and Apuleius. 
. . . For the translating of so delicate, so musical and 
so gracious a poet as Catullus he was absolutely and 
entirely imqualified." 

"Of Burton's rendering of Camoens, we read 
the following : 

" Regarded as a faithful rendering, the book was a 
success, for Burton had drunk The Lusiads till he was 
super-saturated with it. Alone among the translators, 
he had visited every spot alluded to in the poem, and

his geographical and other studies had enabled him to 
elucidate many passages that had baffled his predeces- 
sors. Then, too, he had the assistance of Anbertin, Da 
Cunha, and other able Portuguese scholars and Camoens 
enthusiasts. Regarded, however, as poetry, the book 
was a failure; and for the simple reason that Burton 
was not a poet. . . . On every page we are reminded 
of the translator's defective ear, annoyed by the unnec- 
essary use of obsolete words, and disappointed by his 
lack of what Poe called ' ethericity.' " 

What is told of Lady Burton's reckless bum- 
ing of her husband's papers after his death must 
fill the reader with regret — not for the loss of 
" The Scented Garden," but for the destruction 
of diaries, letters, and other autobiographic 
material that would have made good reading if 
carefully \\'innowed and edited, and would have 
contributed to the better imderstanding of a 
puzzling but ever fascinating personality'. 

The otherwise excellent appearance of Mr. 
Wright's volimies is marred by perhaps more 
than the pardonable number of misprints. Or 
shall we call some of them slips of the pen ? 
"AxundeU," elsewhere thus spelled, appears in 
the genealogical table with one I. Wortley 
Montagu twice takes unto himself a final e. 
Sine does duty for sive in a Latin phrase. 
" Dervise " and " dervish " strive for preference. 
" Ober Ammergau " looks very un-German in 
its divided and bicapitalized form. Last, but 
not least, the author shares with !Mr. Borthrop 
Trumbull of " Middlemarch " renown, with An- 
thony Trollope, John Stuart Mill, and many 
other excellent Englishmen, an unaccountable 
partiality for commencing rather than begin- 
ning his various undertakings. Only one in- 
stance of the latter verb has caught this reviewer's 
eye in ^Ir. Wright's pages. And yet we Ameri- 
cans have been accused of a reprehensible and 
peculiarly national proneness always to com- 
mence, never to begin. 

In the matter of pictorial embellishment, we 
have it on Mr. Wright's authority that " the 
illustrations in this book are of exceptional in- 
terest." They include the Burton family por- 
traits, which, owing to certain family quarrels, 
Lady Burton was unable to use in her own 
work. They are now reproduced for the first 
time. A series of photographs taken at Trieste, 
where Burton succeeded Charles Lever as Brit- 
ish Consul, deserves mention ; and numerous 
pictures of friends of Burton also adorn the 
work. Eleven appendices, including excellent 
bibliographies of Burton, Arbuthnot, Dr. Stein- 
gass, and Mr. Payne, are added. The index, 
though somewhat scanty, is helpful.

The Struggle for LiIberty.* 

For many years the late Lord Acton of 
Cambridge is said to have cherished the plan of 
writing a History of Liberty, which, considering 
his vast erudition, would probably have been a 
masterpiece of historical writing. Professor Mac- 
kinnon, of St. Andrews University, has given us 
the first two volumes of a work planned on 
somewhat the same lines, except that he purposes 
to restrict himseK to a narrower field, — namely, 
the history of liberty during modem times. 
This self-imposed limitation has not, however, 
been strictly observed by the author, for his 
initial volimie is devoted entirely to the pre- 
modern period, with a view to tracing the me- 
diaeval origins of modem liberty which were 
slowly evolved from the chaos and confusion of 
the Roman Empire in the West. The second 
voliune covers the period of the Reformation, 
the major part being devoted to a study of the 
struggle for liberty in England and Scotland ; 
for here it was, says the author, that "the 
great battle of constitutional liberty was fought 
out, and that the struggles of the Reformation 
Age in those countries formed the preliminary 
of that great constitutional drama." Succeed- 
ing volumes, we are told, will be devoted mainly 
to tracing the impidse which the theories and 
conflicts of the sixteenth century gave to liberty, 
which came to full maturity in the French 
Revolution, and were displayed in the constitu- 
tional struggle in England and Scotland in the 
seventeenth century, the American and the 
French Revolutions in the eighteenth, and in 
those movements in the nineteenth century re- 
sidting in the establishment of full intellectual, 
religious, political, and social liberty. 

An examination of the two volumes at hand 
warrants the conclusion that a usefiJ and valu- 
able contribution to historical literature will be 
matle if the work is ever completed on the scale 
its author planned. It shordd be observed, 
however, that the work is designed to be what 
its name indicates — a history of liberty, not a 
philosophical treatise. In vain does one search 
for a discussion of the nature and limitations of 
liberty, with the exception of a few brief obser- 
vations in the preface ; or of the theories that 
have obtained in different ages and by different 
schools concerning the idea and scope of liberty. 
To some, this wiU appear to be a serious defect ; 
but in view of the author's explicit disclaimer 
of an intention to treat his subject philosophi-

cally, criticism on this score is hardly just. 
Nevertheless, we are justified in feeling a sense 
of regret that a work on so important a subject 
should be restricted entirely to its historical 
aspect. 

It may be seriously questioned whether the 
usefulness of the work would not have been in- 
creased by the topical method of ti-eatment 
rather than the chronological. Thus, there is 
no place to which one can turn for an account 
of the rise of religious liberty, or the freedom of 
the press, or the other forms of intellectual 
emancipation. To gain specific information con- 
cerning the development of liberty under any 
one of these heads would require a reading of 
the entire work. Another possible ground of 
criticism is the inclusion in the history of much 
that has little or no bearing on the subject of 
liberty, as the term is ordinarily imderstood. 
Thus, there is a long account of the Reforma- 
tion, that has little to do with liberty except as 
regards the emancipation of the Church from 
Rome. The work is encumbered with a detailed 
history of the religious wars, and a discussion 
of the lives and doctrines of Luther, Von Hutten, 
Calvin, Zwingli, and other reformers, containing 
a large amount of historical detail mainly foreign 
to the subject of liberty. The same is to a less 
extent true of the detailed discussion of the po- 
litical theories of Machiavelli, Hotman, Lan- 
guet, L'Hopital, Bodin, and other political 
philosophers, — theories interesting in them- 
selves, but belonging rather to a history of polit- 
ical philosophy than to a history of liberty. 

Professor Mackinnon's style in places is 
characterized by lucidity of statement, forcefvd- 
ness of expression, and even by brilliancy ; but 
too often the detail which mars his discussions 
is dry and prolix. Unfortunately for the serious 
student, he does not indulge in what he calls the 
luxury of footnotes, or in citations of authorities. 
Often one wishes to know the source of infor- 
mation for particular statements ; but this is not 
given. At the end of each chapter, however, 
is appended a list of the authorities consulted, 
an examination of which affords evidence that 
the author possesses a wide familiarity with the 
literature of his subject. 

Starting out with a definition of liberty as the 
free development of man. Professor Mackinnon 
reviews the history of the Middle Ages in a vain 
search for some evidence of that larger conception 
which the word possesses to-day. He points out 
that the terms " rights," " liberties," and "priv- 
ileges " are frequently met with in the chronicles 
and state papers of the Middle Ages, but that 



they seldom had reference to the masses. " Lib- 
erty of the subject," he says, applied to the 
privileged few, not to the servile class. Popular 
liberty as we understand it was wholly non- 
existent. Occasionally a bold champion of free- 
dom of thought and conscience appeared to 
challenge traditional authority, but he was usu- 
ally suppressed by the sword or fagot. The 
revival of commerce and the growth of towns, 
following the crusades, gave an impulse to the 
movement for emancipation from feudal sub- 
jection. Then came a recognition of the rights 
of the craft-guilds, or artisans, and the gradual 
elevation of the peasantry in the social scale, 
to be followed in time by the admission of the 
Third Estate to the Parliaments. During the 
feudal regime, the indi^'^dual overshadowed the 
State, just as during the period of the Roman 
Empire the State regulated and controlled al- 
most every activity of the individual. The 
sovereignty of the individual under feudalism 
was no more conducive to the development of 
real liberty than was the despotism of Rome, 
for the former regime meant disintegration of 
the State, with its resulting anarchy and oppres- 
sion of the masses, just as the latter meant the 
crushing out of the individuality of the citizen. 
Everywhere the despotism of caste tended to 
compress within narrow limits the liberty of 
action of the individual, and to destroy his sense 
of initiative and energy. The sum total of the 
struggles during the Middle Ages was the ele- 
vation of the serf to a condition of partial free- 
dom, the endowment of the merchant and artisan 
with political and civil rights, the attainment of 
municipal freedom, and the inauguration of the 
movement for intellectual and religious liberty. 
The Renaissance and the Reformation con- 
stitute an important stage in the evolution of 
modern liberty. The former was characterized 
by an emancipation of the intellect from the 
thralls of tradition and the bonds of the feudal 
age, the latter by an emancipation of the con- 
science in spiritual matters. More particularly 
it liberated the soul from the authority of Rome 
and brought it into immediate relation with 
God. The modem spirit of liberty of thought 
and of worship breathed freer, and gradually 
awoke from the nightmare of authority. The 
Reformation, the author says, was a crusade in 
favor of liberty as the age understood liberty ; 
but, mighty as the movement was, it constituted 
little more than the mere backgroimd of that 
larger movement which did not finally take 
shape imtil the nineteenth century.

A Scholar's MrNT>.* 

" I have loved books and music, and, above 
all, the earth and the things of the earth. To 
the wholesome, normal man, these things are but 
an agreeable background, and the real business 
of life lies with wife and child and work. But 
to me the real things have been the beautiful 
things — sunrise and sunset, streams and woods, 
old houses, talk, poetry, pictures, ideas. And 
I always liked my work, too." So writes the 
author of '• The Thread of Gold," not, indeed, 
of himself, but of one of the interesting and 
quiet types of character that he describes with 
so much skill. Yet the words, with but little 
modification, are applicable to him, as also to 
the author or authors of the two volvunes that 
we have grouped with his. It is no doubt an 
intrusion on Mr. Benson's anonymity to attrib- 
ute to him these two delightful imsigned books. 
One sees clearly enough why they are unsigned. 
Such intimate avowals as these are made with 
more freedom from behind even a transparent 
mask. The greater spontaneity and charm of the 
anonymous volumes, as compared with " From 
a College Window," are evidence of this. Cer- 
tainly, however discreet one may incline to be, 
he cannot resist the conviction that the three 
books are the work of one hand. The subjects 
considered, the opinions expressed, the allusions 
and illustrations employed, the personal stamp 
of the style, are as convincing as such things can 
well be. It would be stupid, however, to infer 
that the two imacknowledged volimies are in any 
way autobiographical. They merely express, 
from behind a thin veil of fictitious characters 
and situations, the author's inmost mind. 

These are not clever books, as current taste 
estimates cleverness. They contain no paradox, 
no epigram, no scintillation. Still less are they 
literary books. The writer of them knows his 
poets, but for the most part he carefully ignores 
occasions to quote from them. Indeed, at times 
he seems rather to do violence to himself in 
his effort to avoid an allusion. One need not 
admire the reminiscent habits of Hazlitt and 
Lowell, to regret that in such books and by 
such a man an apt quotation should be so 
patently scouted. For example, it is hard to 
believe that he wrote the following passage in 
" The House of Quiet " without a thought of 
Browning : "A thrush sang with incredible

deamess, repeating a luscious phrase often 
enough to establish its precision of form, and 
yet not often enough to satiate — a triumph of 
instinctive art "; nor this, in " The Thread of 
Gold," without a thought of Arnold : " Beyond 
all this lies that wellspring of inner joy which 
seems to be withheld from so many of us. Is 
it indeed withheld? Can we not by quiet pas- 
sivity, rather than by resolute effort, learn the 
secret of it ? I believe myseK that the source 
is there in many hearts, but that we visit it too 
rarelv, and forget it in the multitude of Kttle 
cares and businesses, which seem so important, 
so absorbing." 

Nor are these books, although they deal much 
with out-of-door delights, the beauty and sig- 
nificance of natural objects, the quaint and 
interesting ways of animals, in any sense 
"nature-books." They deal, to use a phrase that 
occurs in " From a College Window," not with 
" the pursuit of natural history, but the pursuit 
of natural emotion." The latter pursuit is one 
that most so-called '* nature-books " pointedly 
avoid. Most of all, they are not hollow with 
the great emptiness of the current literature of 
" the simple life." Concerning this, Mr. Ben- 
son, in " From a College Window," sufficiently 
says : " The moment that a man is conscious 
that he is simple and humble, he is simple and 
humble no longer." Yet the genuinely simple 
life is the very theme of which they treat. " To 
be natural, to find our true life, to be independ- 
ent of luxuries, not to be at the mercy of pre- 
judices and false ideals — that is the secret of 
life," says " The House of Quiet." 

These books appeal, then, to no special class, 
but, as Wordsworth said of poetry, to man as man. 
They are fidl of a broad and winning hmnanity. 
Hvmian associations give them their charm, and 
a full hxunan pulse beats in every sentence. To 
be sure, they are hardly universal in their ap- 
peal. They are too subtle, too tender, too 
thoughtful for that. But they deal, after all, 
with the elements of '• mere living," which is 
not the less elemental because it is fine and cid- 
tivated. Indeed, their chief charm consists in 
their portrayal of a certain type of mind, and 
they will have an interest for those only who 
can in any degree sympathize with that type. 
This type is perhaps sufficiently described in the 
passage quoted at the beginning of this article. 
It is a mind to which the earth and the things 
of the earth are endlessly interesting and de- 
lightfid, which is " awake and aware " before 
the beauty of the world, which watches for its 
brief epiphanies, which loses no finest touch of

it, which lives in the memory of it. It is alive, 
also, to the beauties of art, though toward these 
it maintains a somewhat reluctant attitude. 
The artist is, by definition, too hard and self- 
centred to satisfy so humane and benign a spirit. 
The cuckoo's " heartless customs " are to him 
suggestive of the ways of the poet. " Those 
that sing so delicately," says " The Thread of 
Gold," " would not have leisure and courage to 
make their music so soft and sweet if they had 
not a hard heart to turn to the sorrows of the 
world "; and " The House of Quiet " affirms, 
even more distinctly, " that literature and art 
play a very small part in the lives of the major- 
ity of people ; that most men have no sort of an 
idea that they are serious matters, but look 
upon them as more or less gracefid amusements ; 
that in such regions they have no power of 
criticism and no judgment ; but that these are 
not nearly such serious defects as the defect of 
vision which the artist and the man of letters 
suffer from and encourage — the defect, I mean, 
of treating artistic ideals as matters of pre- 
eminent national, even of moral, importance." 

We could wish, perhaps, that this fine spirit 
received with less grudging thanks the gifts pro- 
vided by the gods of art. He is in danger of 
giving aid and comfort to persons with whom, 
we are persuaded, he would be even less in sym- 
pathy. Yet we must take him as we find him. 
Perhaps this gentle heresy adds an original and 
piquant touch to a character of such a type. For 
he belongs naturally to a class to whom artistic 
ideals are matters of preeminent importance. 
He is a scholar, in the himiane, not the scien- 
tific, sense of the term, living a quiet life of 
thought and imagination ; though secluded from 
the business of the world, delighting in human 
association of every sort, and feeling to the full 
the charm, almost a pathetic charm at times, of 
the gay young life about him. In " The Thread 
of Gold " he writes : 

" Aiid then, too, there is the tide of youthful life that 
floods every corner of the place. It is an endless 
pleasure to see the troops of slim and alert young fig- 
ures, full of enjoyment and life, with all the best gifts 
of life, health, work, amusement, society, friendship, 
lying ready to their hand. The sense of this beating 
and thrilling pulse of life circulating through these 
sombre and splendid buildings is what gives the place 
its inner glow; this life full of hope, of sensation, of 
emotion, not yet shadowed or disillusioned or weary, 
seems to be as the fire on the altar, throwing up its 
sharp, darting tongues of flame, its clouds of fragrant 
smoke, giving warmth and significance and a fiery heart 
to a sombre shrine." 

To say that the author is a scholar implies, 
of course, that he has the limitations of his class, 



limitations so much greater and more narrow- 
ing, we are assured nowadays, than the limi- 
tations, say, of business or professional life. 
Well, here at any rate is one man who ac- 
cepts them without protest or apology. And to 
many, do doubt, it will be a genuine satisfac- 
tion, amid the prevalent talk of making oneself 
better, or at least different, to find this quiet 
acceptance of the limitations of temperament 
and situation. To have the courage of one's 
limitations — not many of us are as bold as that ! 
He has also the scholar's and the poet's per- 
sistent sense of the past, of " the incommuni- 
cable touch of time." He dwells upon the life 
that has throbbed and grown quiet, worked and 
loved, enjoyed and suffered within the walls of 
the old picturesque English houses that he loves 
so well. Of one of them he writes in " The 
Thread of Gold ": 

"I hajdly know what it was that it spoke of; but I 
felt the care and love that had gone to the making of 
it, and the dignity that it had won from rain and sim 
and the kindly hand of nature ; it spoke of hope and 
brightness, of youth and joy; and told me, too, that all 
things were passing away, that even the house itself, 
though it could outlive a few restless generations, was 
indeed debita morti, and bowed itself to its fall." 

He has the scholar's sense of " the greatness and 
littleness of human life," its relative littleness, 
its absolute greatness. He has the scholar's per- 
spective, which forbids him to approve what 
he calls " the vicious circle " of conventional 
duties and amusements, the scholar's estimate of 
values, that teaches him the futility of ambition 
and influence. " I think that God puts us into 
the world to live," says one of the characters 
that he analyzes, " not necessarily to get in- 
fluence over other people. If a man is worth 
anything, the influence comes ; and I don't call 
it living, to attend public luncheons and to write 
unnecessary letters, because public luncheons are 
things which need not exist and are only amuse- 
ments invented by fussy and idle people "; and 
again : " One has no longer any anxious sense 
of duty ; one desires no longer either to impress 
or influence ; one aims only at guarding the 
quality of all one does or says." Over and 
over again this note of an ennobled Cyrenaicism 
recurs : " To seize the moment, with aU its con- 
ditions, to press the quality out of it, that is the 
best victory." Pater himself is hardly more 
micompromising, though this is not the Cyre- 
naicism of Pater. He lias, finally, the scholar's 
type of religion. "Ought we not," he asks, 
" to try to make our religion a much wider, 
quieter thing?" Before the immense mysteries 
of nature and of suffering, his attitude is that 



1906.] 



THE DIAL. 



35 



of a perpetual question followed by a perpetual 
acquiescence. He has an abiding sense of the 
fatality of things, like that of Edward Fitzgerald 
when he chose for his epitaph the words, " It is 
He that hath made us, and not we ourselves." 
But beneath this, and coloring all his outlook 
upon history, nature, human life, the sufferings 
of dumb creatures, the limitations and sorrows 
of his own career, there is a serene faith in a 
possible explanation, in what he calls " a tender 
secret." 

As to the manner in which all this is ex- 
pressed, the passages q\ioted are the best witness. 
These pages are written con amore^ with an 
indescribable effect of sincerity and meditative 
beauty. Their style is delicately, subtly, un- 
obtrusively figurative. It varies, of course, in 
quality ; and while it is never imitative, it fol- 
lows so closely the feeling of the subject that it 
now and ag^ain reminds us of other men's treat- 
ment of similar themes. The picnic of the 
pauper lunatics, in " The Thread of Gold," has 
a little of the quaint and unusual charm, just 
mis sing the grotesque, of some of Hawthorne's 
tales. Whenever he dwells upon the human 
associations of landscape and buUdings, the 
pathetic evanescence of himian things, the way 
in which even brick and stone, rocks and trees, 
may become saturated with human joy and sor- 
row, upon his pages lies the serene mellow after- 
noon light that rests upon the pages of Irving. 
In a passage like the following, one is reminded 
inevitably of a landscape by Bocklin : 

" A stone's throw away lay a large square moat, full 
of water, all fringed with ancient gnarled trees; the 
island which it enclosed was overgrown with tiny thickets 
of dishevelled box-trees, and huge sprawling laurels; 
we walked softly round it, and there was our goal: a 
small church of a whitish stone, in the middle of a little 
close of old sycamores in stiff summer leaf." 

Such comparisons may easily do these volumes 
injustice. Their manner is original, spontaneous, 
imstudied, but at the same time it is the fruit 
of prolonged and delicate cidtivation. They 
endure perfectly the test of being read out-of- 
doors, for they are as little out of harmony with 
the wide serenities of sea and wood and sky 
and field as the poetry of Walt Whitman. One 
could hardly say more. Yet there is one great 
name, or, rather, one great manner, of which the 
reader of these pages constantly thinks, — the 
name and manner of Virgil. For indeed these 
little idyllic eclogues are like Virgil's, full of 
simple and serene landscape beauty and a spirit 
of quiet retrospection, ending often, like his, in 
the glow of sunset and the peace of nightfall.

The Heakt of the RajXiWAt Probl,em.* 

Mr. Parsons's book on " The Heart of the 
Railroad Problem " comes at a fortunate time 
for its popidarity ; and it is well worth the read- 
ing. The keynote may be taken from the 
preface. 

" A plan was adopted for a book, to be called ♦ The 
Railways, the Trusts, and the People,' which is now in 
the press. . . . For the preparation of this work the 
writer traveled through nine countries of Europe, and 
over three-fourths of the United States, studying rail- 
ways, meeting railroad presidents and managers, minis- 
ters of railways, members of railway commissions, 
governors, senators, and leading men of every class, in 
the effort to get a thorough understanding of the rail- 
way situation. He also made an extensive study of the 
railroad literature of leading coimtries, and examined 
thoroughly the reports and decisions of commissions 
and courts in railroad cases in the United States. As 
these studies progressed, the writer became more and . 
more convinced that the heart of the railroad problem 
lies in the question of impartial treatment of shippers. 
The chief complaint against our railroads is not that 
the rates as a whole are unreasonable, but that favorit- 
ism is shown for large shippers or special interests 
having control of railways or a special pull with the 
management. This book consists, in the main, of the 
broad study of railway favoritism, which was made as 
a basis for the generalizations outlined in the brief 
chapter on that subject in ' The Railways, the Trusts, 
and the People.' " 

^Vhatever opinion of the railways a reader of 
this book may carry away as he closes it, he 
will have to say that the multitudinous forms of 
discrimination have been laid open to the light 
of day. As many chapters discuss as many 
forms as passenger rebates, direct freight re- 
bates, denial of fair facilities, classification and 
commodity rates, oil and beef, imports and 
exports, locality discriminations, long-haul de- 
cisions, Colorado fuel rebates, midnight tariffs, 
terminal railroads, private cars, while one fruit- 
ful chapter is devot^ to free cartage, demurrage, 
the expense bill system, goods not billed, and 
nuUing in transit. The history of remedial 
attempts runs along through the Granger Laws, 
the Hepburn Report, the Interstate Commerce 
Act, Supreme Court decisions, ten years of 
Federal regulation, the Elkins Act, the Wiscon- 
sin revelations. The closing chapters are con- 
cerned with the possibility of regulation of 
rate-making, and methods for accomplishing that 
end. As the book went to press in March, 
1906, the discussion of recent measures ends 
with the presentation to Congress of the Esch- 
Townsend, Interstate Commission, and Hepburn 
bills. Of the more recent occurrences which

have shaped the last-mentioned bill into the 
Conference Bill of the two houses of Congress, 
and the Act of June 30, 1906, an admirable 
resume may be found in the weekly columns 
of that excellent journal, " The Railway Age." 

The merits of Mr. Parsons's book are in its 
thorough and compendious presentation of the 
various evils that have come to pass in the 
making of railway rates. If the treatment is 
open to criticism, it is along the line of the 
genesis of these conditions. In a country that 
is a continent, and that has grown in less than 
a hundred years from a wilderness to an empire, 
the mere physical conditions — in both time and 
space — have inevitably generated the industrial 
conditions that we find oppressive to-day, al- 
though they have grown logically out of earlier 
ones that were the fostering cradle of our na- 
tional greatness. It is to the credit of writers 
like Johnson, Pratt, and Stickney, that they see 
this ; it is likewise apparent that in their eager- 
ness to reform abuses Mr. Hudson and Mr. 
Baker have ignored it. Yet any legislation that 
is to accomplish permanent good must avoid the 
single vision of the latter, as truly as that of 
the enthusiastic hero-worshipper of the railroads, 
Mr. Spearman. The railroad men are, it is 
true, the makers of rebates and all other dis- 
criminations ; but they are in a degree victims 
of growing and enlarging conditions, not only 
in their physical and economic, but even in their 
moral environment, which have helped to make 
them what they are. The words " guilty " and 
" criminal " must not be used too strenuously 
with reference to statutory guilt and crime by 
a public tarred with the same brush. On the 
other hand, it is satisfactory to see how com- 
pletely the array of facts in Mr. Parsons's cata- 
logue of discrimination, as practised even to the 
present year, is enforced by the testimony that 
has been presented in the courts since this book 
went to press, and how both demolish the ab- 
surd statement made in Mr. Spearman's popular 
book, " The Strategy of Great Railroads," that 
" Alexander J. Cassatt has made unjust discrim- 
ination in railroad traffic a thing of the past." 

It is easy to see the evils ; it is more difficult 
to point out the remedy. Mr. Parsons's chapter 
on " fixing rates by public authority " is very 
valuable. One by one he goes over the objec- 
tions to a general rate-making by some central 
authority, and meets them most lucidly. If the 
amendments to the Hepburn bill added by the 
Senate can be enlarged to include private cars, 
Pullmans, pipe-lines, express companies, water 
carriers, and terminals, under the restrictions 



of common carriers, and the abatement of the 
pass evil can be reinforced by a commission with 
peremptory rate-making powers, Mr. Parsons is 
of the opinion that the public would be bene- 
fitted, and no vested interest would suffer injury. 
Events — and public opinion too — have marched 
fast in the field of this railway question in the last 
few months ; and it does appear to a looker-on in 
Vienna that we are in a fair way to try the experi- 
ment. There can be little doubt that under the 
new law, which embodies Mr. Parsons's sugges- 
tions, the best class of railway men — the Hills, 
Hughitts, Fishes, MeUens — wiU fall into line 
and cheerfully seek to satisfy the American pub- 
lic. For it must ever be remembered that the 
mere presence of the power in the Commission 
to make a rate will act as it did between 1887 
and 1897, when it was thought that the Com- 
mission had such power ; the great bidk of the 
rates will still be made in the railroad offices by 
railroad experts, and the fimction of the Com- 
mission will be in a large degree preventive 
rather than revisory. Jokn J. Halsey. 



Recent Fiction.* 



Once more Mrs. Ward has based the fundamen- 
tal situation of a novel upon a historical prototype. 
And this time, — " once for all," as she puts it, — 
she makes explicit admission of the practice, and 
justifies it in terms that should forever silence the 
ill-natured criticism that has assailed "Lady Rose's 
Daughter " and " The Marriage of William Ashe." 
The artist, she insists, " may gather from any field, 
so long as he sacredly respects what other artists 
have already made their own by the transmuting- 
processes of the mind. ... To the teller of stories,, 
all that is recorded of the real life of men, as well 
as all that his own eyes can see, is offered for the 
enrichment of his tale." In accordance with this 
principle, finding in the life of Romney a story of 
lasting human interest, Mrs. Ward has not hesitated 
to make use of it for the modern instance of " Fen- 
wick's Career." Fenwick is a young artist, married

tunity of displaying them, goes to London alone to 
fight for recognition and make a home for his wife 
and child. After a hard struggle, he wins his way, 
partly with the aid of a wealthy patron, and the sale 
of two pictures makes it possible to plan a reunion of 
his family. But in a moment of weakness he has 
made the fatal mistake of allowing his London 
friends to suppose him unmarried ; and when this 
fact reaches his wife, as it does in a roundabout 
way, it makes her start for London at once. Reaching 
her husband's studio during his absence, she dis- 
covers evidence of what seems to her unfaithfulness ; 
and. acting upon a jealous impulse, she writes him 
a note to say that she has left him forever. Then 
comes a lapse of twelve years ; and when we resume 
the story, it is to find that Fenwick has become 
famous, but, unable to discover the whereabouts of 
his wife and child, has grown embittered and morose. 
Tactlessness and an imcompromising temper have 
lost him nearly all his friends, and put him at outs 
with the oflScial representatives of art. The only 
real joy that all these years have brought him haa 
been the friendship of Madame de Paatourellei, the 
daughter of his first patron : and to her he has never 
revealed the secret of his marriage. She is now set 
free by the death of a worthless husband, and is 
prepared to become something more than Fenwick's 
friend, when the secret gets out. This poignant 
situation is succeeded by renewed efforts to find the 
runaway wife and child, efforts which eventually 
prove successful, and lead to a reunion. The lives 
of both husband and wife have been broken beyond 
repair by the estrangement, and Mrs. "Ward is too 
genuine an artist to gloss over, in the interests of a 
conventional sentimentality, the essential hopeless- 
ness of the situation. It is to the child alone — now 
grown to gracious maidenhood — that we must look 
for whatever gleam of light is cast upon the closing 
chapters of the novel. '* Fenwick's Career " seems 
to us nearly if not quite the best of the author's 
novels. Fenwick himself is anything but an agree- 
able or sympathetic character, but he is a real indi- 
vidual and not an intellectual abstraction. This is 
Mrs. Ward's chief triumph in her present work. 
Madame de Pastourelles, although portrayed with 
the most refined and delicate art, is no more remark- 
able than several other women of the novelist's 
creation. Another positive merit of this novel is 
found in its comparative freedom from the prolixity 
that lies like a dead weight upon most of its prede- 
cessors. It is true that subjects are discussed — art 
subjects, in this case, with the usual critical jargon ; 
but they are not discussed to death, and for this we 
may be truly thankful. For Mrs. Ward's chief de- 
fect hitherto has been her inability to control within 
reasonable bounds the reflective and philosophical 
tendencies which give so marked a character to her 
ntellectual activity. 



Mr. and Mrs. Wflliamson have side-tracked, a«r 
it were, the motor-car, for the purpose of writing 
their international comedy of manners entitled 
" Lady Bettj' across the Water." Lady Betty is a 
nice English girl, who is shipped to America by her 
designing mother, both to get her out of her less 
attractive sister's way, and to secure for her a rich 
American husband. She has a variety of interesting 
experiences, in New York, Newport, Chicago, and 
rural Ohio ; and, as she tells of them in the first 
person, her comments upon American life are highly 
diverting. The following passage, which we find in 
the opening pages, is an example of the sort of tiling 
that gives the book its undeniable charm. 

" I am never taken into family conclaves, becaose I 'm not 
<rat yet. I don't see what difference tliat makes, especially 
as I 'm not to be allowed to come ont until after Vic 's mar- 
ried, becaose she was presented fonr years ago, and isn't even 
engaged yet ; so, for all I can tell, I may have to stay in till 
I 'm a hnndred, or leak out slowly when nobody is notieii^, 
as Vic says girls do in the middle classes." 

Concerning Lady Betty's romance, we will not par- 
ticularize. It begins on the steamer which takes her 
to America, upsets all the plans contrived for her, and 
culminates acceptably to most of the persons inter- 
ested. A frothy sort of cleverness is the chief attri- 
bute of the story, but its thin vein of wit is exhausted 
long licfore the end is reached, and nothing more 
substantial is found to take its place. 

We can say little in praise of "My Sword for 
Lafayette," by Mr. Max Pemberton. The author 
has a certain facility of invention, but his style is 
without flexibility, and his figures are rarely any- 
thing more than puppets. The present romance 
begins with the departure of Lafayette for the Amer- 
ican colonies, and ends in the diays of the French 
Revolution. The narrative is in the first person, 
r^ted by an American friend of the distinguished 
Frenchman, and includes adventures in France, 
America, and England. The heroine dies upon 
the gfuillotine ; but she is never realized for us with 
sufficient distinctness to make the reader greatly 
care what becomes of her. 

Mr. F. J. Stimson has put a considerable list 
of books to his credit since his graduation from 
Harvard over a quarter of a century ago. Hi a first 
venture — the amusing skit " RoUo at Cambridge " 
— is still remembered ; and at least as much may 
be said for "Guerndale," his first serious noveL 
Taking the law for his vocation, he has ever since 
continued to cultivate fiction as his avocation ; and 
his work has grown broader and stronger with the 
passsing years. He has at last produced a novel, 
" In Cure of Her Soul," which is not only the finest 
thing he has ever done, but which is a really note- 
worthy addition to our literature. The very title of 
the book is indicative of its serious character. It is 
a study of contemporary American society, covering 
the period of the author's o»ni maturity, and dealing 
with the life that he has known at fiiWhand — the 
social life of New York and Newport and the Berk- 
shires, and the phases of business and politics which 
a lawyer comes to know most intimately in the

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



practice of his profession. The outline of the story 
is simple enough. It is the old story of a man and 
two women, of his impulsive marriage with the one 
and his subsequent discovery that he loves the other. 
But Mr. Stimson does not work out his plan upon 
the usual sentimental lines. He appears to be 
enough of the old-fashioned moralist to regard a 
marriage as something sacred, to hold that life has 
a higher purpose than the realization of eager desire, 
and to believe that men are bound to accept the 
consequences of their acts, even at the cost of much 
self-sacrifice and sufferihg. He has thus weighted 
the novel with meaning by framing it upon high 
ethical ideals and a fine spirituality. As a study of 
the appalling vacuity and corruption of the pleasure- 
seeking wealthy classes, it is quite as good as " The 
Hotise of Mirth," and it offers us a much more truth- 
ful portrayal of contemporary society, because its 
outlook is broad enough to include types of clean 
living and earnest purpose as well as types of vulgar 
frivolity. The variety of its interests is, in fact, 
quite extraordinary ; and however lightly a char- 
acter or a situation or a social problem is touched 
upon, we feel the presence of a controlling principle 
of sanity in the treatment. The style, moreover, is 
flexible enough to fit the many moods and require- 
ments of the narrative. It can be concise, vivid, and 
dramatic, if need be ; or it can be gravely reflective 
on occasion, and touched with spiritual beauty. The 
frequent use, for emotional purposes, of suggestions 
from Dante and Wagner is most felicitous, and the 
fact that the author resorts to these two sources of 
inspiration is one of the clearest indications of the 
fineness of his temper. The book is not without its 
faults. Both Dante and Wagner are misquoted ; 
the passages which relate to the manipulation of 
certain railroad properties are too complicated to be 
understood by lay readers; the construction of the 
novel as a whole is faulty, and the process by which 
the soul of the erring wife is cured is left largely to 
our imagination. In failing to work out this prob- 
lem psychologically, the author has missed a great 
opportunity, and to a certain extent disappointed us 
in the expectations which might reasonably be based 
upon the title he has chosen for his work. 

Novels which deal with the corruption of our 
political life are getting to be very common nowa- 
days, which may be a cheering indication of an 
aroused moral sense in the community. At all events, 
such books are to be welcomed, for the evils upon 
which they are based are notorious, and to realize 
them in the public consciousness is to take an im- 
portant step toward their remedy. An exceptionally 
straightforward and clean-cut book of this class is 
"The District Attorney," by Mr. WiUiam Sage. 
The hero is a young man just out of the law-school, 
the son of one of our " captains of industry " (how 
this title suggests to us the French analogue of 
chevalier d'industrie ! ) When he learns the nature 
of the methods by which his father has become 
wealthy, he refuses to profit by them, and turns to 
his profession for an independent career. Presently 



he gets into politics, is nominated by the independ- 
ents for the office of district attorney, and, after an 
exciting campaign, is elected. Then he proceeds to 
attack the franchise corruptionists, and in logical 
succession lands in the penitentiary first a group of 
aldermen, then the go-between, and finally, in the 
face of desperate resistance, the arch-criminal, a 
magnate who has just bought a seat to the Senate 
of the United States. The whole affair goes on with 
the beautiful precision of clockwork, — in which 
respect we fear that the story is sadly untrue to life. 
We are inclined to think, also, that the note of 
didacticism is at times a little too effusively sounded ; 
but to the book as a whole sincere praise may be 
accorded. And special praise must be given to cer- 
tain of its episodes — to the vaguely-localized chapter 
that takes us to the South American port where one 
of the rascals has hidden himself, and to the final 
scene in the jury-room where the fate of the dis- 
graced senator is sealed. For the sake of the 
romantic conventions, a love-story is mingled with 
all this serious matter, but contributes only a slight 
element of the total interest. 

Frank and Jim — otherwise Frances Candler and 
James Durkin — are two young persons who, finding 
the earning of an honest livelihood a very humdrum 
affair, are tempted to join the ranks of the predatory, 
and turn their wits to account in various question- 
able ways. Having once entered upon the criminal 
path, they find themselves urged to still further 
steps, and engage in an interesting series of burgla- 
ries, frauds, and confidence games. They conveniently 
attribute their misconduct to " force of circum- 
stances," and are both loud and frequent in the pro- 
testation that to live honestly is what they chiefly 
yearn for. But the day of reform is to be post- 
poned untn they have made a " strike " of sufficient 
magnitude to secui-e them a comfortable existence. 
Then they will come out into the open, and life will 
be all idyllic. Although this story is about as im- 
moral in its tendencies as any that we have ever 
read, the crimes which it deals with are so ingeni- 
ously contrived as to prove remarkably interesting. 
Both are experts in applied electricity, and the 
technical jargon of the profession is everywhere 
forced into the service of the narrative, and even into 
the characterizations. It is at least a novelty to read 
a book in which the heroine is described in such 
terms as the following : 

" She was as fluctuant, she told herself, as the aluminum 
needle of a quadrant electrometer. No, she wa.s more like 
the helpless little pith-ball of an electroscope, she mentally 
amended, ever dangling back and forth in a melancholy con- 
flict of repulsion and attraction." 

This is the modern scientific substitute for the old- 
fashioned supernatural machinery of good and bad 
angels, as used, for example, in Marlowe's " Dr. 
Faustus." The title of tlxis novel is "The Wire- 
Tappers," and Mr. Arthur Stringer is its author. 

The hero of " Breakers Ahead " is a young En- 
glishman who quarrels with his father and comes to 
America in quest of a career. We learn this ele-

mentary fact of his nativity with some diflficulty, for 
to describe a youth as •' a prime favorite among his 
class-mates at college, the leading spirit of the fra- 
ternities, popular with soubrettes and chorus-girls," 
is certainly not to describe him as a student at one 
of the English universities. But when we have once 
" placed " him, the story of his fortunes presents no 
serious obstacles to our comprehension, although the 
plot has one veiy- weak link, and although his sec- 
ond wife is not very consistentiy portrayed. The 
action of the novel turns upon the fact that he takes 
to himself this second wife, for his deserted first 
wife is still living, and the fact that he believes her 
to be dead upon the flimsiest of hearsay evidence is 
the weak link to which reference has already been 
made. Otherwise, the story is exceptionally well 
put together, and rises steadily toward a climax of 
interest that proves fairly enthralling. And hack- 
neyed as the essential plot would seem to be from 
this bare outline, it has nevertheless features of 
marked originality, and gives us something more 
than the impression of re-reading a tale already 
many times told. The manner of its telling is 
matter-of-fact and effective. The author's name, 
A. Maynard Barbour, is, we understand, the name 
of a woman. 

Mrs. Ryan's new novel has so confused a way of 
introducing its characters and setting forth their 
relationships that we are midway in the volimie be- 
fore we have fairly straightened them out. Aside 
from this defect of constructive technique, we may 
say that the work is one of vivid dramatic quality 
and appealing romantic charm. It is a romance of 
California in the early days of the Crringo invasion, 
and is entitied "For the Soul of Rafael." There 
are few subjects in American life that offer such 
effective material for romance as this, and few 
writers have been as successful in blending into a 
composite xmity the three elements which it offers. 
There is, first, the element of ancient Aztec tradi- 
tion ; then there is the element of Spanish Catholi- 
cism superimposed upon that heathen foundation; 
and, finally, there is the element of Americanism, 
aggressive and irreverent, riding rough-shod over 
the sentiments and idealisms of the older civiliza- 
tion which it so rudely displaced. All three of 
these influences are given their full artistic value in 
Mrs. Ryan's romance, an accomplishment which 
means wide knowledge and deep sympathy on the 
author's part. The illustrations to the book are from 
photographs selected or posed for the purpose. Their 
natural and archaeological features are interesting, 
but the human figures they introduce do not seem 
either to fit naturally into their surroundings or to 
confirm our preconceptions of the characters they 
represent. 

'' The Court of Love " is an extravaganza of the 
most fantastic description, and when we have read 
far enough to discover its character we rub our eyes 
and once more scan the title-page to make sure that 
it really is the work of Miss Alice Brown. But 



suggestive as it is of another kind of '' Alice " 
plunged into a new " Wonderland," we hurry breath- 
lessly through its pages, and wish that there were 
more of them. Indeed, when its fast and furious 
close is reached, we are left harrassed by all sorts 
of cruel doubts concerning the knots that are not dis- 
entangled and the complications that are not cleared 
up. No outline of its plot — if there be such a thing 
about it — could convey the least sense of its bub- 
bling humor and joyously riotous course.

the work of the Agricultural Department at Wash-

Experiment Stations in the several States, and may 
perchance be impressed with the fact that agriculture 
is at last becoming a progressive science. Mr. Har- 
wood's knowledge appears to be in general derived 
at second hand, and he consequentiy not Lnfre- 
quentiy falls into error. Men have not yet learned 
to "set aside the laws of Nature." Linnaeus was 
not an active botanist in 1700, nor is protoplasm 
the " life principle " of anything. A squash may 
develop " roots several thousand feet in length," but 
it must be in some " new earth " unknown to geog- 
rapher or astronomer. Even the " new earth man " 
may hardly persuade us that if the redwood were 
" 2000 years old when came the dawn of Christi- 
anity," therefore human life may be prolonged be- 
yond " the natural span." On page 78 we have an 
erroneous statement as to the constitution of the air, 
and on page 80 an inaccurate and misleading expla- 
nation of the formation of dew. Mr. Harwood's 
style is, moreover, open to criticism in many ways. 
It is, as already suggested, by far too strenuous. 
We Americans are surely interested in aU that is

really interesting and deserving of consideration, 
and a simple statement of fact should be sufficient 
to command attention. For an American, a florid 
or lurid presentation of a practical matter suggests 
exaggeration ; he becomes suspicious, if not incredu- 
lous. Mr. Harwood's book, to do him justice, needs 
editing, at least to an extent that would have pre- 
vented such a sentence as the following : " Indications 
at once pointed to a condition of afEairs approaching 
similar to that in Spain," etc. But notwithstanding 
its defects, the volume offers much real information ; 
and while we believe that it is stUl the same old 
earth which must yet for long years continue to sup- 
port the race, yet we are glad to welcome any im- 
provements in culture or method that may hasten 
the coming of any " new earth " wherein may dwell 
not only righteousness, but industry, wisdom, and 
comfort and happiness for men. 

The museums J^^ intelligent and studious visitor 
and ruins of in Rome has felt two pressing needs : 
ancient Rome, g^ guide to its museums somewhat less 
minute and technical than the work of Helbig, and a 
guide through the ruins of the ancient city less volu- 
minous and more up-to-date than Middleton. A 
work in two small volumes called "Museums and 
Ruins of Ancient Rome " (Dutton), with Dr. Walter 
Amelung and Dr. Heinrich Holtzinger as authors, 
arouses cheerful expectations. These are not dis- 
appointed so long as we have Dr. Amelung as a 
guide through the museums (Volume I. ). Only the 
most important works are touched upon, but these 
are discussed by that most helpful of methods, the 
comparative. For example, in the presence of some 
special statue in a Roman gallery he describes sim- 
ilar works in other collections, or places on the page 
an illustration of a more complete or better render- 
ing of the same statue, or a more correct representar 
tion of an original to be foimd elsewhere. Before 
such important works as the Praxitelean Venus of 
Cnidos, in the Vatican Gallery, we have an oppor- 
tunity of comparing through the illustrations the 
much better copy of the head (in Berlin), and the 
whole of the present figure as it exists under the tin 
drapery which " moral barbarism " has wrapped 
about the lower limbs. Looking at the Discobolus 
of Myron, we have three variations with which to 
compare it. Thus the volume becomes quite a lib- 
eral education in the history of antique sculpture, 
which is made more thorough by its Historic Index 
in the concluding chapter. The second volume, on 
the Ruins, is somewhat smaller and distinctly poorer 
than the first. Dr. Holtzinger has not avaUed him- 
self of the results of the most recent excavations. 
He seems scarcely to be aware of anything that has 
been done since the present century came in. Yet 
these six years have been the most brilliant in the 
whole history of excavation. In the Roman Forimi 
more has been done in this time to uncover ancient 
monuments and explain ancient history than in all 
the combined centuries before. The tomb of Rom- 
ulus and the beautiful church of Santa Maria Antiqua 



have indeed each the inadequate attention of one 
sentence. But concerning the wonderful Sepulcre- 
tum, — that primitive burial-ground which, first dis- 
covered in 1902, has now opened up an earlier page 
in the history of Rome than ever before known, — 
there is not a single word. The excavations of 1904 
around the base of the so-caUed Column of Phocas, 
which revealed brick-stamps of the time of Diocle- 
tian, four centuries before Phocas and the finding of 
the pontifical vases near by, are ignored. The base 
of the equestrian statue, found in 1903, is given no 
significance, and the name of Domitian in connection 
with it is not mentioned, although the work is almost 
certainly his, as proved by a remarkable correspon- 
dence to the references in Latin literature. Some 
of the illustrations of this work are from recent 
photographs ; but the majority are hopelessly out of 
date, especially those on the northern border of the 
forum, which show the old tenement houses and 
street-car track that were demolished as long ago 
as 1899. The translation from the German has been 
done admirably by Mrs. S. Arthur Strong, LL.D. 

Phases and Prof. John R. Commons has selected

in America. economic journals, and has edited 

them for a volume entitled " Trade Unionism 
and Labor Problems," one of a series of " Se- 
lections and Documents in Economics " (Ginn & 
Co.), in which Mr. William Z. Ripley, the general 
editor, has attempted to apply the " case system " 
to the teaching of descriptive economics. The 
method is interesting, and for two reasons has led, 
in the case of Mr. Commons's book, to results 
especially fortuitous. Each chapter, in the first 
place, shows a greater intimacy with its particular 
subject than one author would have been able to 
sustain throughout the treatment of a question so 
comprehensive as " the labor problem "; and, sec- 
ondly, the sum total of the opinions in the collection 
so discreetly compiled are far more valuable than 
those of any one man. Moreover, despite the va- 
riety of material in the book, a fair amount of unity 
is preserved through Mr. Commons's introduction, 
which adequately relates the chapters. To compare 
in any way these chapters, varied as they are in 
subject matter, is obviously impracticable ; but one 
is tempted to recommend, as exceptionally well pre- 
sented, Mr. Warne's "The Miners' Union," Mr. 
Commons's "The Teamsters of Chicago," and Mr. 
Bogart's " The Chicago Building Trades Dispute 
of 1900." — For one who has found Mr. Commons's 
work commendable, it is gratifying to turn to 
"Studies in American Trade Unionism" (Holt), 
edited by Mr. Jacob H. Hollander and Mr. George 
E. Barnett ; for their method and results have been 
somewhat similar to those evinced in the volume 
first named. This latter volume consists of articles 
written by advanced students in Johns Hopkins 
University, under the direction of the editors, each 
student undertaking the detailed investigation of 
some one carefully selected aspect of trades-unions.

THE DTATi

A $6j000

These tasks were faithfully performed, and the 
product is a careful and concise presentation of 
rarious phases of the labor problem. The chapter 
on the Knights of Labor and the American Fed- 
eration is perhaps of the most general interest, and 
ahonld be read by all who are as yet unenlightened 
upon the subject of these two great organizations. 
In reading these articles, one is deeply impressed 
with the fact that labor unions are in these days 
essentially business organizations, definitely and 
minutely systematized. The consequence is a more 
commercial relation than formerly existed between 
employer and employed, and the elimination of 
the somewhat hypocritical " paternalism." This, in 
turn, seems to bring about more open-handed dealing 
between the two g^eat forces, and the recog^tion 
that each insists upon consideration from the other. 
The authors in all cases deal with facts rather than 
with theories; yet they evidently do not believe 
capital and labor entirely antagonistic, nor the ad- 
justment of their differences impossible. 

The late William Bross of Chicago 
established a prize in connection with 
Lake Forest University, to stimulate 
the production of the best books or treatises " on 
the connection, relation, and mutual bearing of any 
practical science, or history of our race, or the facts 
in any department of knowledge, with and upon the 
Christian Religion." In 1902, a prize of six thou- 
sand dollars was offered for the best book fulfilling 
any of the purposes described in the trust agree- 
ment, the manuscripts to be presented on or before 
June 1, 1905. The judges were Professors G. T. 
Ladd of Yale, A. T. Ormond of Princeton, and 
G. F. "Wright of Oberlin. After examination of the 
essays and awarding of the prize by number, the 
sealed envelopes were broken, and it was found that 
Professor James Orr, of Glasgow, Scotland, had won 
the large simi on proofs of a book entitled ''The 
Problem of the Old Testament" For thirty years 
Professor Orr has been carefully gathering up evi- 
dence on some of the serious problems that face 
every thoughtful reader of the Old Testament. His 
books already published have sufficiently indicated 
his type of mind. He takes a comprehensive grasp 
of any subject, but maintains a prevailingly conserv- 
ative position. He states very fairly his opponent's 
view of the case, but his own view is, of course, 
always the stronger one. In this formidable volume 
of over 600 pages (Scribner) he presents a survey 
of the whole case before us. His statements are 
buttressed by profuse quotations and abundant ref- 
erences to the critical literature of the day. His 
conclusions are always conservative, though often, 
we are glad to see, progressively so. His work is 
not that of a theological archaeologist who has no 
mind to see the new, but he finds truth worth rec- 
og^tion in the advances of modern scholarship. 
With all his generous treatment of his opponents, 
we are still of the opinion that the right kind of 
sympathy with progfressive thought would not have 



led him so completely to close the door to the legiti- 
mate results of Biblical criticism. With the com- 
mittee of award constituted as it was, this is precisely 
the kind of work that would be likely to capture the 
priie. There is no book in English that presents 
with such fulness and streng^th, from the conservative 
point of view, the problems of the Old Testament. 

Tico notable Three volumes of Professor Oman's 
centuriet of Collaborated " History of England " 

Engiuhhutorv. (Putnam) have now appeared — 
volumes dealing with the Stuart, the Tudor, and the 
Post-Saxon periods. The last of these (the second 
in chronological order) is devoted to the two cen- 
turies following the battle of Hastings ; it bears the 
title " England under the Xormans and Angevins," 
and is written by Mr. H. W. C. Davis of Balliol 
College, Oxford. '" The period . . . covered by the 
present volxmae," says the author, "possesses a dis- 
tinctive character and unity." At first sight it ia 
difficult to see in what this unity can consist; we 
remember this period as one of unsettled conditions, 
of great conflicts in church and state and society. 
But when we look backward from Evesham to 
Hastings, and note what the intervening years ac- 
complished, we realize that the author's statement 
is correct. When Edward I. ascended the throne, 
there was a truly English nation with a highly or- 
ganized feudal society and a vigorous national church. 
The principle of representative government had 
been recognized, courts had been established, and a 
common law created. The author's purpose is to 
trace and account for these "remarkable develop- 
ments." The subject is therefore treated mainly 
from the political side; but the social and institu- 
tional phases are not neglected. In many instances 
the author's conclusions are not in accord with cur- 
rent opinions, but in every case they are carefully 
stated and usually well supported. To him, the his- 
tory of the age does not record " a duel between two 
races," but "rather a struggle of native against 
foreign ambitions and ideas." The effect of the 
Crusades on England is rated very low ; the reader 
is left with a doubt if English society was influenced 
at all by these movements. Of the Great Charter, 
the author says : " In reality, Magna Charta made 
few lasting innovations and asserted no new liber- 
ties." He accuses the framers of the Charter of 
undue conservatism and lack of foresight. Still, he 
places a higher value on that document than certain 
continental historians have done. The book is 
written in a clear, easy, and entertaining style, and 
as a popular history it is likely to take high rank. 

Fascination, of ^^^ furniture, old plate and china, 
oid-fa*hioned and old lace, have all had many an- 
wall-paper,. nalists ; and now comes Miss Kate 
Sanborn riding another and wholly origrinal new-old 
hobby. She has delved into the history and hunted 
up the surviving remnants of " Old-tiiine Wall Pa- 
pers," and from her researches and her unique 
collection of photographs has made a fascinating 



42 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



monograph, which the Literary Collector Press of 
New York publishes in an attractive limited edition. 
Miss Sanborn was born in a room whose walls were 
covered with one of the famous Bay of Naples pa- 
pers, and when she bought her abandoned farm, a 
few years ago, she found on its walls several quaint 
hand-painted floral designs, hidden under a half- 
dozen layers of cheap modern covering. So she 
never labored under the popular misconception that 
in colonial days walls were all whitewashed. In- 
stead, she was greatly surprised to find so little 
material on the subject of the evolution of modern 
wall-hangings. The effect of this sparsity of mate- 
rial is evident in the earlier chapters of the book, 
where interesting but disjointed odds and ends of 
general information and description and anecdote 
present an unpleasant effect of scrappiness. The 
chapters on early American papers are much better, 
but the chief interest of the book lies undoubtedly 
in its excellent reproductions of over eighty old-time 
papers, most of them being patterns that covered the 
walls of colonial or early nineteenth-century man- 
sions in New England. Some are reproduced in the 
original colors, and many plates show details as well 
as general views. Most of the papers shown are the 
panelled ones, with a different scene for each side of 
the room. Tropical views and mythological themes 
seem to be favorites, and the designs generally show 
an elaboration that is, to say the least, amazing. 
These old papers are of course rapidly disappearing, 
and even now Miss Sanborn's collection of photo- 
graphs could not be duplicated. So her book is 
likely to become standard, and people who care for 
antiques will wish to own it. 

A new life of Clear, readable, interesting : such wiU 
the founder of doubtless be the judgment of the 
Methodum. average reader of Mr. T. C. Win- 

chester's " Life of John Wesley " (Macmillan) . The 
influence which John Wesley wielded for nearly a 
third of the eighteenth century in England would 
suggest the need of just such a volume as the author 
has here given to the public. There are other 
lives of Wesley, representing greater labor in com- 
position and research than the present one, but no 
other presents with such vividness the personal side 
of Wesley's career. The author has not attempted 
an elaborate study of the man and of the important 
movement which has grown into the world-wide 
ecclesiastical organization known as Methodism. He 
has told us, rather, the story of both the man and 
the movement from the viewpoint, not of a disciple, 
but of one who believes that the story is worth tell- 
ing afresh for popular reading. With a fine sense 
of perspective, Mr. Winchester's narrative covers 
the years of Wesley's youth, his education at Ox- 
ford, his experience in America, and his transition 
struggle between a native bent toward Calvinistic 
introspection and those influences from without 
which enabled him at last to emerge in the clear 
light of spiritual self-discovery and service. Wes- 
ley's debt to Whitfield, who revealed to him the 



possibilities of open-air preaching to the masses, was 
an important influence in the rise of Methodism. 
The genius of Wesley for organization and personal 
instruction, resulting in the formation of the " United 
Societies," is exhibited as a potent factor in the 
launching of the movement. The author has not 
permitted the social, intellectual, and religious con- 
ditions of eighteenth century England to pass with- 
out adequate notice. He sees that those conditions 
furnish the natural background to a biography of 
Wesley. The last chapter, on "John Wesley the 
Man," is an especially clear and satisfactory presen- 
tation of the great preacher's mind and personality. 



Modern 
Italian 
novelists. 



Dr. Joseph Spencer Kennard's " Ital- 
ian Romance Writers " (Brentano's) 
is an English version of a work pub- 
lished last year in Italy. It is not, as might be 
inferred from its title, a chronological history of 
Italian novels and novelists, but a study of the most 
important of those, from Manzoni to d'Annunzio, 
— a study undertaken for the purpose of showing 
that the "birth of the novel was contemporary 
with the idea of nationality " and that " its develop- 
ment has always been simultaneous with that of the 
nation." Recalling some of the chief events of the 
past century, and examining many of the most im- 
portant novels published in the past hundred years, 
the author traces " the parallelism and synchronism 
of the political and literary awakening of Italy," 
and compares that country's " last political changes 
with its last period of mental evolution and its most 
recent literary production, the modern novel," in 
order to show " how this mirror of the social con- 
ditions of the young nation has been in turn both 
cause and effect of the Peninsula's intellectual devel- 
opment." Then, taking up the Italian novel of to- 
day, and studying it by means of a comparison of 
past and present conditions, he not only concludes 
that the novel of the future will be whatever Italian 
life shall be, but ventures to predict that " it will 
be the instrument, no less than the interpreter, of 
Italy's progress." This hopeful view is based upon 
his confidence in the country's moral improvement, 
and with it the development of a greater respect for 
women and the solution of many perplexing social 
problems. Aside from its general comments and 
conclusions, the book has value for the chapters on 
the various Italian novelists included in its survey. 
It is a pity, however, that American readers could 
not have been presented with a version in less 
" rocky " English than the present one. 

Discredited ^he mass of controversial writing 

notions of the concerning the military conduct of 
Civil War. ^}jg Civil War receives a belated ad- 

dition in Mr. Samuel Livingston French's volume 
on " The Army of the Potomac " ( Publishing Society 
of New York). The work covers the history of the 
organization and campaigns of this great division of 
the Federal forces to 1863, when Meade took com- 
mand. Here the story closes abruptly^ without

THE DTAT.

e^lanation or apology. The purpose of the volume, 
as announced in the preface, is to award the honors 
impartially, and to frame an absolutely imbiassed 
and correct judgment concerning the various com- 
manders of the Army of the Potomac How impar- 
tially the work has been done, and how imbiassed 
are the author's judgments, may be inferred from 
the terms used in describing General McClellan's 
"weakness of character," his ''bravado," his '"out- 
rageous treatment " of General Pope, his " imper- 
tinent and assinine " letters to President Lincoln, 
his candidacy for the presidency " on a Secession 
platform," and his *' treasonable conduct " on many 
occasions. By contrast, Burnside is praised for his 
loyalty, courage, and honorable service. Hooker's 
futility is condoned because of insufficient troops 
and of his strained relations with Halleck. The 
volume is composed mainly of extracts from official 
documents and letters, chosen to bolster up the 
rather absurd and discredited positions taken by the 

author. 

An American ^ recent volume in the excellent 
expounder of series of '* Beacon Biographies " 
modem thou^jht. (Small, Maynard & Co.) deals with 
the life and work of John Fiske. As the author, 
]Hr. Thomas Sargeant Perrj^, emphasizes, the interest 
in Mr. Fiske's career lies " in the part he took in 
unfolding modern thought to his fellow countrymen." 
Apart from his precocitj-, the story of his early life 
is not unusual, and his later career was marked 
chiefly by the appearance of his various works. 
His significance lies in his early acceptance of the 
principles of evolution, which both in philosophic 
and in historical aspects he clearly grasped and 
cogently taught. In American history he was a 
pioneer, in bringing the events he described into their 
proper relation to the history of the world, and in 
presenting them as elements in the " one increasing 
purpose " that runs throughout all cosmic and all hu- 
man development. ^Ir. Fiske was '* a born teacher," 
uniting accurate and varied knowledge with lucid 
presentation and a rare power to charm and arouse 
the enthusiasm of listener or reader. To those for- 
tunate enough to enjoy his personal acquaintance, 
Mr. Fiske's was a gracious and attractive person- 
ality. Of his vast scholarship, his remarkable mem- 
ory, his humor, and his unfailing fairness, sincerity, 
and integrity, Mr. Perry's brief sketch gives a clear 
and definite impression. One turns from it with 
the feeling that the picture is drawn in bold, strong 
lines, regretting only that fuller detail was not 

attempted. . 

j>otthumou* " ^an the Social Creator " ( Double- 

ettav* of a day, Page & Co. ) is mainly a coUec- 

sociai reformer, ti^^ of addresses deUvered by the late 
Henry D. Lloyd during the ten years preceding his 
death, and now brought together in a volimie. 
The author never having intended them for publica- 
tion, the addresses, as the editors remark, contain 
" many defects in argument and lucidity which Mr. 
Lloyd would certainly have remedied before pub- 
lishing." But these defects, though numerous and 



ever-present, will not deter the reader who is touched 
with the peculiar social longings and hopes of the 
day ; for Mr. Lloyd was a social prophet of no ordi- 
nary- power and inspiration. The main thesis of the 
present book is indicated by the title, namely, that 
man is creating, out of the divine potentialities of 
his own nature, the social life and institutions which 
are, for a large body of thinkers to-day, the •' Eang- 
dom of Heaven" upon earth. The book is also 
understood to embody the author's religious beliefs. 
One chapter sets forth that '* social progress is al- 
ways religious "; another preaches " the religion of 
labor "; elsewhere we find the more questionable 
doctrine that Gt)d is not yet, but is becoming, through 
the process of human social development. Every- 
where we find optimism — evil interpreted as good' 
in the making, and the future heralded as a mighty 
advance upon the present. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Leon H. Vincent's "American Literary Masters " 
(Houghton) is a series of essays upon nineteen of the 
most famoos American writers, from Irving to Whit- 
man. The work is pleasing in style, and provides much 
systematically-ordered information. Although not ap- 
parently intended for use as a text-book, it might prof- 
itably be used for that purpose. 

" Modem Love : An Anthology," is published by Mr. 
Mitchell Kennerley. It is a little book of poems by 
(mostly) living English authors, "chosen from fifty 
different volumes," and representing perhaps half that 
number of poets. The booklet is claimed to be " the 
first anthology of love poems to be published which has 
avoided the insincere elaboration and hyperbole of the 
style of the love poems of early literature." 

" Days and Deeds " is a compilation of verse for 
children's reading and speaking, and is published 
by the Baker & Taylor Co. The editors, Burton E. 
Stevenson and Elizabeth B. Stevenson, have made a 
classified collection of what they call "the really 
significant poetry relating to Americsm holidays and 
to great Americans," and have added thereto "an 
anthology of the seasons," and a brief selection of 
" poems every chUd should know." This should prove 
a very useful book for schools. The number of special 
days illustrated is no less than twenty-seven, and 
includes even such dubious occasions as April Fool's 
day, Chicago day, San Jacinto day, and Carnation day. 

" A Hjmdbook to the Works of William Shake- 
speare," by Mr. Morton Luce, is published by the Mac- 
nullan Co. It is a convenient compendium of "the 
critical and explanatory helps that must otherwise be 
sought from many books." A series of introductions 
to the separate works, taken chronologically, fills the 
bulk of the volume, the remaining contents being chap- 
ters of history, biography, and bibliography, with dis- 
cussions of Shakespeare's art, philosophy, and metrics. 
The book is prepared with knowledge and judgment, 
and seems to be, with the possible exception of Professor 
Dowden's similar work, the best single volume availr 
able for a fairly close and detailed study of the poet. 
Certainly, the amount of matter packed within a small 
compass is remarkable.

Taine's critical study of Balzac, translated by Mr. 
Lorenzo O'Rourke, and provided with an introductory 
" appreciation " of the author by the same hand, is a 
recent publication of the Funk & Wagnalls Co. 

The publishing firm of Fox, Duffield & Co., of New 
York, will hereafter be known as Duffield & Co., Mr. 
Fox retiring. The officers of the new corporation are 
Pitts Duffield, Kenneth Duffield, and F. A. Richardson. 

Two recent text-books pvdjlished by the Macmillan 
Co. are " English Studies in Interpretation and Com- 
position," by Messrs. M. S. and O. I. Woodley, and a 
« School History of the United States," by Mr. Henry 
William Elson. 

To the "Temple Greek and Latin Classics" (text 
and translation) has just been added Plato's " Euthy- 
phro," " Apology," and " Crito," introduced and edited 
by Mr. F. M. StaweU. Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are 
the publishers. 

New editions of Baedeker's " Rhine " and " Great 
Britain," the sixteenth and sixth respectively, are im- 
ported by the Messrs. Scribner. Mr. J. F. Miiirhead 
continues to act in his capacity as editor of the " Great 
Britain " manual. 

A third edition of the Abb^ J. A. Dubois's work on 
« Hindu Manners, Customs, and Ceremonies," as trans- 
lated by Mr. Henry K. Beauchamp, comes to us from the 
Oxford Clarendon Press. The translator's introduction 
and Max Miiller's prefatory note are both reprinted. 

To the " Miniature Reference Library " of the Messrs. 
Routledge is now added " Five Thousand Words Fre- 
quently Misspelt," by Mr. William Swan Sonnenschein. 
Many proper names are included, and the little book as 
a whole bears the marks of very careful preparation. 

" Early Diplomatic Negotiations of the United States 
with Russia," by Mr. John C. Hildt, and " The Finances 
of American Trade Unions," by Dr. A. M. Sakolski, are 
two recent publications of the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity in the " Historical and Political Science " Series. 

Messrs. Cassell & Co. now issue their annual volume 
of " Royal Academy Pictures " for the nineteenth time. 
The best of the eighteen himdred works exhibited this 
year are here in acceptable black and white, with 
Forbes's " Evening in the Village " as a frontispiece in 
photogravure. 

A tenth edition of " The Elements of Jurisprudence," 
by Thomas Erskine Holland, is published by Mr. Henry 
Frowde at the Oxford University Press, from which 
source we have also " The First Year of Roman Law," 
translated by Dr. Charles P. Sherman from the French 
of M. Fernand Bernard. 

An old fashion in sensational fiction is recalled to 
us by a new edition of James De MiUe's " Cord and 
Creese," a story better worth reading than most of the 
more recent examples of its class. Even the double 
columns of the old familiar print are reproduced. 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers first copyrighted the book 
in 1869, and now send us this reprint. 

From Messrs. Taylor & Taylor (Richmond) we have 
an issue of " The John P. Branch Historical Papers of 
Randolph-Macon College," having for its contents a 
study of the public life of R. M. T. Hunter, by Mr. D. R. 
Anderson, and a series of reprints from the " Richmond 
Inquirer " of 1821, illustrative of the opposition to Chief 
Justice Marshall in his native State of Virginia. 



The book of " Chevalier Bayard," in Sara Coleridge's 
translation, is a new " Pocket Classic," and " The 
Travels of Mungo Park " a new " Thin Paper Classic," 
in the well-known series of reprints published in London 
by Mr. George Newnes, and imported for the American 
market by the Messrs Scribner. 

All students of Spanish literature are familiar with 
the extensive collection by Rivadeneyra, in 71 volumes, 
known as the Bihlioteca de Autores Espanoles, the pub- 
lication of which was begun in 1846 and suspended in 
1880, shortly after the death of its founder and pub- 
lisher. No one now remains of the little group of 
scholars who were associated together in this most 
praiseworthy task of editing and publishing such Span- 
ish texts as were either rare or difficult of access imtil 
that time to the general public. We are particularly 
interested, therefore, in a prospectus recently received 
of a Nueva Bihlioteca de Autores Espanoles, to be pub- 
lished by the well-known house of Bailly-Baillifere y 
Hijos of Madrid, imder the direction of that profound 
scholar and delightful writer, Marcelino Men^ndez y 
Pelayo, with the collaboration of such noted specialists 
as R. Men^ndez Pidal, M. Serrano y Sanz, A. Bonilla 
y San Martin, E. Cotarelo y Mori, M. Mir, and other 
distinguished Spanish scholars. It is the purpose of 
the Nueva Bihlioteca to ofPer a continuation and com- 
plement to the Bihlioteca of Rivadeneyra, though not to 
follow too closely its plan or imitate exactly its methods, 
particularly in the reproduction of texts. In the col- 
lection by Rivadeneyra, modern orthography is used in 
all texts, even those of the Middle Ages ; and in many 
philological accuracy is wanting. In the Nueva, all 
texts preceding the classical epoch are to be reproduced 
with their peculiar orthography, those of the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries to be left to the discretion of 
the individual editors, and those of the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries to be printed according to modern 
usage. Voliuninous though the work of Rivadeneyra 
is, there are some literary classes or periods that are 
but poorly represented, if at all. This is notably true 
of the literature of the Middle Ages. Of the classical 
epoch, the dramatists anterior to Lope, and those of 
second order, lyrical poetry, mystical literature, didactic 
writings and historiography, receive but scant attention. 
In the eighteenth century the drama, the novel, and 
scientific literature are more or less neglected, and 
almost no treatment is given to nineteenth-century 
writers. It is the intention of the Nueva Bihlioteca to 
fill up these lacunse, and if the ambitious project is real- 
ized, the number of volumes in the collection may readily 
exceed the 71 of Rivadeneyra. The scholarly treat- 
ment of the works already published speaks well for 
the rest of the series, and we feel convinced that we 
are greeting the best of the many excellent collections 
of which Spanish literature can boast.

CIt is the purpose of this little publication to make the mass of current 
magazine literature accessible to the every-day reader, — to show just 
what the leading periodicals contain and to indicate the general character 
and scope of the principal articles. It is not a library index, — there 
are no confusing abbreviations or cross-references. The arrangement is 
of the simplest and most convenient sort, to meet the needs of the average 
busy reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the magazines of 
the month, that will give one in five minutes the information hitherto to 
be obtained only by long and tedious examination of contents-pages on 
the news-stands.

What some of the critics of England and America 
are saying about Mr. MORLEY ROBERTS'S 
unusual novel 

THE IDLERS 




FOURTH PRINTING 



The English Press 



London Literary World: " Mr. Roberts has done for the fast set of London what Mrs. Wharton did for the same 
social clasa in America. It is a powerful novel — a merciless dissection of modem society." 

London Homing Pott: " Mr. Morler Roberta has written many excellent books, but none so good as ' The Idlers.' 
The character of Ren6e is made the occasion of one of the most vivid and tragic scenes in fiction." 

London Graphic: " A vigorously written tale containing much of the keenest observation and very admirable char- 
acter drawing." 

St. Jamet't Gazette (London) : " An occasionally unpleasant but decidedly readable novel of modem society. Con- 
tains sitoations which would be the finest French farce were they not treated by the aathor with a somewhat ghastly 
serioosneaB." 

London Queen : " Mr. Roberts indulges snbtleties, and is never afraid to call a spade a spade. The stoiy goes with a 
swing and a gaUop which carries its readers over a good many stiff fences." 



The American Press 



yeu- York Sun : " The story makes absorbing reading. It is full of clever irony. The interest is maintained and is 
sharp everywhere — in dialogue, the description, and the comment. There is is a dramatic part that runs to tragedy 
and that will make the reader ■ sit up." The characters are ingeniously imagined and skilfully handled. They supply 
both comedy and tragedy." 

St. Lou 14 Republic : " There is something of the Bernard Shaw about him, but he is a trifle pleasanter, and, poasibly. 
cleverer. Thai, too, he figures to provide always the wholesome contrast between the agreeable and disagreeable. 
His is at once a broader view than Shaw's, and he can occasionally see other than the ills, oddities, meannesses, 
baseness, foUy . and inconsistency of the human being. He is a saner philosopher and truer artist, which accentuates 
the piquancy of his pessimism and trenchant cleverness, when he does happen upon ills, which, by the way, is most 
of the time." 

Chicago Inter Ocean : " An entertaining galaxy of English types, portrayed with bmtal directness ; an interesting 
story, full of strong situations and clever and cynical satire." 

yew York Times Saturday Revieu- : " Mr. Roberts believes in love, in honor, even in comradeship, though he jeers 
at some things which wear those names. Because of these things and a knack that way, the story is a story for 
people who like their romance spiced with wit and anchored to a sense of things as they are." 

Boston Advertiser : "A real story, rather ugly in spots, but vibrant with life and vigorously told. One may rail 
against some of Mr. Roberts's ideas, but he will not suffer the fate of one ignored." 

Boston Transcript: " The story is well told, has many dramatic situations, some brilliant satire, and also abundant 
humor, or it could not be from the pen of Morley Roberts." 

Philadelphia Xorth A merican : " The accomplished author of ' Rachel Marr,' a great novd of genuine passion, has 
raked the British gilded muck heap, and found material for his practised hand. ' The Idlers ' bristles with dramatic 
situations, the final scene being a tragedy of appalling intensity."

A POE TS' SH RINE. 

There is no spot on earth more sacred to lovers 
of English poetry than that comer of the old 
Protestant Cemetery at Rome where the mortal 
remains of Keats and Shelley were laid to rest 
nearly a century ago. Adonais and Ariel, the 
poet of pure beauty and the poet of boundless 
love, the spirit who " outsoared the shadow of 
our night " and the " heart whose beating blood 
was running song," — these, of all English 
poets, are the ones with whom our associations 
are the most tender and whose memory is the 
dearest. Many are the pilgrims who have re- 
paired to their graves as to a shrine, whose tears 
have welled from a deeper source than sentiment, 
and whose devotion to the good and beautiful 
has been strengthened by the example of those 
lives, so soon extinguished and so futile in seem- 
ing, yet so potent in their sway over the emo- 
tions and the ideals of the ensuing generations. 

The Roman municipality has upon several 
occasions during recent years, actuated by a zeal 
for " improvements," threatened to invade the 
resting-place of our poets. On one occasion, a 
section of the old wall of the cemetery was 
actually demolished for the purpose of making 
a new street. The British Embassy at Rome 
has thus far been able to oppose successfully 
these attempts at vandalism, although in one 
instance the mischief was averted only by the 
interposition of Queen Victoria herself. The 
house on the Piazza di Spagna in which Keats 
lived the last weeks of his stricken life has also 
been threatened by the " march of progress," 
and has suffered sadly from neglect. 

About three years ago, a small company of 
American writers, fortuitously gathered in Rome, 
determined to make an effort to save the graves 
of the poets from violation, and at the same 
time to preserve the Keats hoiise from disfigure- 
ment by converting it into a sort of museum or 
memorial of both Keats and Shelley. An inter- 
national organization was planned, with com- 
mittees in Rome, London, and New York, having 
for its objects the purchase of the house and 
the perpetual guardianship of the two graves. 
It was desired to establish in the house a col- 
lection of relics and a library, under the charge 
of a curator, and to rent the imneeded floors as

[August 1, 



a means of maintenance. There would thus be 
provided in Kome a pleasant meeting-place for 
English and American travellers, on a spot hal- 
lowed by its associations with one of the poets. 

Since the organization of these committees, 
much effective work has been done in a quiet 
way, and official endorsement has been given to 
the plan by Their Majesties the Kings of Italy 
and England, and by the President of the 
United States. The purchase of the Keats house 
will require about twenty-two thousand dollars, 
although a somewhat larger f imd than this should 
be raised to place the project upon a secure 
basis. One-half the purchase price has already 
been secured (mostly from American subscrib- 
ers), and an option obtained upon the property 
by an atlvance payment. It remains only to 
complete the fund and obtain full possession, 
which must, however, be done by next January. 
A public appeal is now made for contributions, 
large or small, from all lovers of poetry who 
wish to become associated with this highly com- 
mendable enterprise. Subscriptions will be re- 
ceived by Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson, 
33 East 17th St., New York, the secretary and 
treasurer of the American Committee. There 
seems to be little doubt that the needed amount 
will be forthcoming, and it should be a matter of 
pride with our own countrymen to see that this 
imdertaking, American in its conception, should 
owe its success chiefly to American support. 

Of all the old-world shi*ines to which lovers 
of poetry repair, there is probably no other that 
so fully meets the conditions of ideal fitness and 
beauty as the spot in the old Roman cemetery 
over which this tender guardianship is now 
sought to be established. It has been described 
many times, and pictured until the old Roman 
wall, the pyramid of Cains Cestius, the solenm 
cypresses, and all the other features of the scene 
have been made familiar 'beyond all similarly 
consecrated places. Yet it may not be amiss 
to quote once more the stanza from "Adonais" 
which was the first description of the spot ever 
penned. 

" And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time 
Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand; 
And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime. 
Pavilioning the dust of him who planned 
This refuge for his memory, doth stand 
Like flame transformed to marble ; and beneath 
A field is spread, on which a newer band 
Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death 

Welcoming him we lose with scarce-extingiiished breath." 

" It makes one in love with death to think 
that one shoidd be buried in so sweet a place," 
was Shelley's comment upon the burial-place of 



Keats. A year later he slept within sight of 
the grave of his brother poet. 

It may not be amiss also to recall the epitaphs 
of the two singers. That of Keats, as composed 
by Severn, reads as follows : 

" This grave contains all that was mortal of a young 
English poet, who, on his deathbed, in the bitterness of 
his heart at the malicious power of his enemies, desired 
the words to be engraved on his tombstone : ♦ Here lies 
one whose name was writ in water,' Feb. 24th, 1821." 

Upon the wall near by, a medallion portrait 
was afterwards placed by joint English and 
American devotion, and beneath it this acrostic : 
" Keats, if thy cherished name be ' writ in water,' 

Each drop has fallen on some woman's cheek — 

A sacred tribute such as heroes seek, 

Though oft in vain, for dazzling deeds of slaughter. 

Sleep on ! not honoured less for epitaph so meek." 

For Shelley's tombstone, Leigh Hunt proposed 
a pompous legend : 

" Percy Bysshe Shelley, Anglus, oram Etruscam 
legens in naArigiolo inter Ligurnum portum et Viam 
Regiam, procella periit VIII. Non. Jul. MDCCCXXIJ. 
iEtat. Suje XXX." 

But his friend Trelawny adopted a simpler 
form, giving, besides the name and the dates, 
only the expressive motto, "Cor Cordium," and 
the familiar lines from " The Tempest ": 

" Nothing of him that doth fade 
But doth suffer a sea-change 
Into something rich and strange." 

It was a singular fate that spared the respec- 
tive companions of the two poets until they 
became old men, and at last brought them to 
rest with the friends of their youth. Severn, 
who lived in Rome for the rest of his life, died 
in 1879, at the age of eighty-three, and was 
buried by the side of Keats. Trelawny, four 
years his senior, outlived him by two, and died 
at his country home in England at the ripe age 
of eighty-nine. This is a very interesting story. 
In May, 1881, the director of the Protestant 
Cemetery received a letter from Mr. Trelawny, 
saying that as he was now very old he wished 
to prepare for death, and requesting that a place 
be made ready for his ashes. This was a great 
surprise to the authorities, for it was nearly sixty 
years since Trelawny had purchased the plot, 
and nothing hatl been heard from him since 
1822. In July, Trelawny was informed that the 
grave was ready for him, and in August he died. 
His body was cremated, his ashes were taken 
to Rome and interred by the side of Shelley's, 
heart. His tombstone bears this inscription : 
" These are two friends whose lives were tmdivided ;. 
So let their memory be now they have glided 
Under the grave ; let not their bones be parted. 
For their two hearts in life were singL«-l\eart,^d.'*

The Early Lefe of Tolstot.* 

Tolstoy's life seems now so near its end, and 
his messages so fully delivered, that the time 
is ripe for a study in detail of the development 
of the man, and for a new emphasis upon his 
influences on modem society and modem litera- 
ture. To portray a life so crowded with dra- 
matic incidents, and to interpret a literary work 
so large and significant, a biographer must 
have a broad s^nnpathy ynth the larger aims of 
his subject and a great capacity- for details ; he 
must be able to construct a strong character out 
of many paradoxical and often unadmirable 
traits. The beginnings of such a study, with 
especial emphasis ujwn the biographic element, 
may be found in the first translated volume 
dealing \^'ith Tolstoy's life and work, compiled 
by Paul Birukoff and re\ised by Tolstoy him- 
self, which has been prepared for the new " In- 
ternational Edition " of Tolstoy's works. 

This biography belongs to the impersonal, 
editorial type, as regards its author ; he keeps 
in the background, and allows his subject 
to be portrayed, in character and acti\aties, 
through joiuTials, letters, and a few published 
extracts. Mr. Birukoff was a pupil of Tolstoy, 
however, and in occasional passages, as well as 
in the underlying motive of his work, he shows 
a loving reverence for his master. The bibli- 
ogi-aphy, which is a part of the introduction to 
the present volume, indicates how fully the edi- 
tor has read and considered various estimates of 
Tolstoy's early life and his first ventures in 
authorship. The period of Tolstoy's life covered 
by this volmne is his boyhood and early man- 
hood, lea\Tng him at thirty-four years of age. 
It may seem imwise to some readers that this 
fragment of such an important life-history as that 
of Tolstoy should have been published before 
the other portions of the biography were com- 
pleted. Tolstoy's development was so unusual, 
yet sequential, that one might prefer to follow 
the traces of it in a complete circle rather than 
study it in segments, at distant intervals. Such a 
completion of the biography would also allow the 
reader to grasp the vital points in the character 
and genius of its subject by that concentration of 
interest which is often lost by the serial method. 

This single voliune, however, is far more than

prefatory. It is an exhaustive analysis of the 
youth and early manhood of a personality of ex- 
ceptional interest, with whose later years of 
achievement the reading-public is generally fa- 
miliar. Within this period were developed and 
displayed those traits which have given to Tol- 
stoy the high rank now accorded him as social 
seer and literary ai-tist. In youth, as in later 
life, he showed a character compounded of pas- 
sionate ardor, truthfulness, modesty, and a love 
of goodness which could not be submerged be- 
neath indulgence in e\Tl and vice. In the In- 
troduction to this volume. Count Tolstoy has 
laid stress upon his determination to be truth- 
ful, — to avow his early sensuality and vanity 
no less than his yearnings for the good. He 
divides his life into four periods of imequal 
length : his joyous childhood, his sensuous and 
weak youth, his quiet family life of middle 
years, and his last twenty years of deeper activi- 
ties in reform and letters. With earnest sin- 
cerity he adds : '' Such a history of my life 
during these four periods I should like to write 
quite truthfully, if God will give me the power 
and time. I think that such an autobiography, 
even though very defective, woidd be more prof- 
itable to men than all that artistic prattle with 
which the twelve volimies of my works are filled, 
and to which men of our time attribute an un- 
deserved sigTiificanc€." 

The present volume adds few new incidents 
to the known facte regarding Tolstoy's ances- 
try and boyhood. There are graphic pictures 
at intervals, — that of the sensitive boy just 
emerging from babyhood, listening to the weird 
tales by the blind story-teller in his grand- 
mother's chamber, or companioning his father 
on the himt and bearing away life-impressions 
of his gayety and kindness. Prominent among 
those who left deep influences during the child- 
hood at Yasnaya Polyana was his aunt Tatiana 
Alexandrova ; of her part in his emotional de- 
velopment he writes : " She taught me the spir- 
itual delight of love. She taught me this, but 
not in words : by her whole being she filled me 
with love. I saw, I felt, how she enjoyed lov- 
ing, and I understood the joy of love. This 
was the first thing. Secondly, she taught me 
the delighte of an unhurried, lonely life." Other 
memories were associated with his brothers, 
Nichoki and Sergius, and with the death of his 
father, which first awakened a sense of religious 
awe in the shy, self-conscious lad. These more 
serious traite did not preclude a few boyish 
pranks, like jumping from a two-story window 
or clipping his eyebrows.

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



In his later books, "Youth " and " My Con- 
fession," Tolstoy has revealed, with unsparing 
frankness, the depravity of his university years 
and his life at Moscow, with their indulgences 
in cards, routs, and adventures among the gyp- 
sies. At the same time, the reader is made to 
feel the tumultuous inner life of yearning and 
unrest. Mr. Birukoff has summarized the brief 
period thus : " During these three years of his 
life, Tolstoy tasted of everything which a pas- 
sionate and energetic young man could seize." 
Meantime, his literary tastes were seeking ex- 
pression, and he planned a story of gyjJsy life, 
or a novel, modelled after Sterne's " Senti- 
mental Journey." These early efforts at au- 
thorship were not brought to fruition, and the 
few published tales which first won him notice 
among the St. Petersburg group of writers are 
scarcely recalled to-day. With his enlistment 
in the army of the Caucasus, in 1850, came a 
crisis both in his moral and literary develop- 
ment. The scenery of the mountains and the 
simple life of the peasants awakened his crea- 
tive genius, and the resiJts were shown in " The 
Cossacks " and " Tales from Sebastopol." 

Much space is given in this volume to the 
relations between Tolstoy and Turgenieff, with 
details of their sundry meetings and correspon- 
dence. Men of common ideals and gifts, their 
temperaments forbade much spiritual affinity, 
although there was mutual admiration, and even 
affection, when they were separated. Following 
the two journeys abroad, and the death of his 
brother Nicholai, — experiences which broad- 
ened and deepened Tolstoy's soul, — he put into 
practical experiment his theories of educational 
reform which had been maturing in his mind 
for twelve years. The reader will here find 
detailed information regarding the ten schools 
under Tolstoy's control, lists of the teachers, 
and many incidents of interest in the school- 
life, amplified from his articles on Education 
and Instruction. 

At thirty-four years of age, after many sen- 
timental adventures, Tolstoy loved worthily the 
younger daughter of a family friend. Dr. Bers. 
The Countess Tolstoy has won the admiration 
of the world by her broad and clear intellect, 
her wise administrative ability, her wonderful 
insight into Tolstoy's character, and her pro- 
tecting loyalty to him. In " Anna Karenina " 
he has used the declaration of love " by primary 
letters," by which he expressed his own interest 
in the young girl, and gained her response. 
True to his unswerving honesty, he insisted that 
she should read all his diaries revealing his 



earlier irregularities. The struggle of heart and 
soul through which the maiden passed, as she 
saw her hero unveiled, is told with dramatic 
vividness, suggesting the similar motive in Mr. 
James Lane Allen's novel, "The Mettle of the 
Pasture." With sadness but with sympathetic 
courage, Tolstoy's friend accepted the past and 
pledged herseK to his future of repentance and 
achievement. This volume leaves the reader at 
the threshold of Tolstoy's home-life and literary 
fame. He had already written a few novels that 
were known to critics and authors but were scant- 
ily read by the public, as "The Snow-Storm," 
" The Two Hussars," " Family Hapjiiness," 
" Polikushlca," and "The Memoirs of a Billiard 
Marker." Within these forgotten studies in 
fiction were the germs of that moral element 
and denunciation of contemporary social evils 
on which he has " concentrated all his powerful 
artistic gifts. ' ' One more experience — the search 
for and grasp of true religion — was needed to 
crystallize his moral and mental enthusiasm and 
give peace to his spiritual unrest. The editor 
closes his work with this forecast : "In the next 
volume we hope to narrate that current of events 
in Tolstoy's life which brought him to the mo- 
ment when the thirst for truth, and the suffering 
occasioned by not finding it, culminated, and 
eventually led him to the only solution, the only 
foundation of life, and the only guide in his 
further exertions — to reUgion.^^ 

The attractiveness of this volume is enhanced 
by nearly thirty illustrations, some rare photo- 
graphs from early paintings of Tolstoy, many 
portraits of his family, and a few fine views of 
the parks and buildings of Yasnaya Polyana, the 
family estate. Annie Russell Marble. 



The Anatomy of Dogma.* 



In his book entitled " Some Dogmas of Re- 
ligion," Dr. McTaggart says : 

" By metaphysics I mean the systematic study of the 
tiltimate nature of reality, and by dogma I mean any 
proposition which has a metaphysical significance " (p. 1). 

" Religion is clearly a state of mind. It is also clear 
that it is not exclusively the acceptance of certain 
propositions as true. It seems to me that it may best 
be described as an emotion resting on a conviction of a 
harmony between ourselves and the universe at large " 
(p. 3). 

It may fairly be asked, whether reality has 
any other nature than its ultimate one ; and if 
so, how we are to know when we have reached 
that nature. Would it not be better to content

61 



ourselves with a more modest conception of 
metaphysics and dogma, frankly confessing that 
the " ultimate " nature of anything, as distin- 
guished from its apparent or imaginable nature, 
is beyond the field of human thought ? Nothing 
is more commonplace or familiar than time ; yet 
it is entirely out of the question to imagine the 
whole of time, or its limits, or its limitless 
quality — if to be limitless is a quality. Meta^ 
physics, it seems to me, finds its true scope in 
bridging, by means of thought, the gaps between 
observable phenomena ; and dogma consists of 
statements made on metaphysical grounds. It 
is a nice question whether any dogma, as thus 
defined, can be said to be knowledge. At first 
sight, it appears easy to deny it that property, 
confining knowledge to the results of experience 
— the field of science : but an analysis of the 
simplest scientific proposition shows that it con- 
tains more than the description of immediate 
experience. The definition of religion also ap- 
pears to be criticisable. Who knows anything 
about " the universe at large "? Would it not 
be equally rea.sonable to say that the sense of 
location depends upon a con^action of position 
in space at large ? Undoubtedly religion depends 
upon a conviction of harmony between ourselves 
and something else ; but what is that other ? 
It seems to me that the true basis of the feeling 
depends on our sense of worth ; there is some- 
thing in ourselves which responds to an eternal 
standard of value, which we believe cannot fail. 
We may not know how powerfid the right is in 
the universe, but we do not believe in its extinc- 
tion, and we do believe that, whatever its nu- 
merical strength, it amounts to more than all 
else, because it alone has value. 

Having thus found faidt ^\-ith the very basis 
of Dr. McTaggart's argmnent, we may frankly 
admit that his book is lucid and interesting, 
and that it will do excellent service in clearing 
away many venerable cobwebs. At the same 
time, the common man will undoubtedly protest 
that it is not quite fair to demolish the phrases 
he is accustomed to vise, and then assume that 
his real position is also overthrown. One could 
wax sarcastic over the expressions " Dear Sir " 
and "Yours truly," employed daily in letters ; 
but letter-writers woidd be amused rather than 
wounded by the exposure of their unveracity 
and insincerity. 

The first chapter of the book sets forth the 
imjjortance of dogma ; in the second, the estab- 
lishment of dogma is considered at length. The 
thii'd and fourth treat of hmnan immortality 
and pre-existence, and seem to me to be the best 



in the book. The conclusion is reached, that 
the arguments which may lead us to believe in 
immortality also make it probable that we have 
pre-existed. We cannot give a condensed sum- 
mary of these chapters, which are full of inter- 
esting suggestions. Instead, we offer a rather 
long quotation from the close of Chapter IV., 
as a good example of the author's style, and 
especially for the purpose of showing that his 
residts are not wholly negative. 

" Pre-existence indeed, a» we have seen, renders more 
probable a plurality of future lives. And the prospect 
of a great number of lives — perhaps an infinite num- 
ber, though this is not a necessary part of the theory — 
gives us the prospect of many dangers, many conflicts, 
many griefs, in an indefinitely long future. Death is 
not a haven of rest. It is a starting-point for fresh 
labors. But if the trials are great, so is the recompense. 
We miss much here by our own folly, much by unfavor- 
able circmnstances. Above all, we miss much because 
so many good things are incompatible. We cannot 
spend our youth both in the study and in the saddle. 
We cannot gain the benefit both of mibroken health 
and of bodily weakness, both of riches and of poverty, 
both of comradeship and of isolation, both of defiance 
and of obedience. We cannot learn the lessons alike 
of Galahad and of Tristram and of Caradoc. And yet 
they are all so good to learn. Would it not be worth 
much to be able to hope that what we missed in one life 
might come to us in another ? And would it not be 
worth much to be able to hope that we might have a 
chance to succeed hereafter in the tasks which we failed 
in here ? . . . But though the way is long, and perhaps 
endless, it can be no more wearisome than a single life. 
For with death we leave behind us memory, and old 
age, and fatigue. And surely death acquires a new and 
deeper significance when we regard it no longer as a 
single and imexplained break in an unending life, but 
as part of the continually recurring rhjrthm of progress 
— as inevitable, as natural, and as benevolent as sleep. 
We have oidy left j^outh behind us, as at noon we have 
left the sunrise. They will both come back, and they 
do not grow old " (pp. 138-139). 

Chapter V. deals with Free-will, and offers 
a strong argument in favor of the determinist 
position. It seems to me that the discussion 
proceeds largely from a misapprehension as to 
what is ordinarily meant by " free-will," that 
term being, in its common usage, somewhat of 
a misnomer. If I say my will is free, I do not 
mean, as the indeterminist is declared to mean, 
that it is dependent upon nothing ; I mean, 
really, that it is not free, that I control it. 
Logically, indeterminism in its literal and pure 
form cannot be defended, and is rightly de- 
molished by the author ; but there still remains 
a practical and recognizable position, which is 
entirely contrary to pure or mechanical deter- 
minism. Dr. McTaggart reduces this, in effect, 
to the feeling that our wills are true causes of 
phenomena, as they certainly are, whether them- 
selves already caused or not. This seems only 



62 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



to be one aspect of the matter ; and it is pos- 
sible that freedom to vary experience may be 
the real basis of " free-will," and ultimately of 
virtue itself. If this is declared to be illogical, 
it may be fairly replied that there is no escap- 
ing the paradox ; for one who declares that 
there is no such thing as freedom puts himself 
out of com-t as a judge of its existence. Either 
he is discussing something which is incompre- 
hensible, or he has not rightly apprehended the 
practical meaning of the term. 

Chapters VI. and VII. treat of the idea of 
God, and it is excellently argued that the literal 
idea of an omnipotent God presents so many 
difficulties and contradictions that it is untena- 
ble. It is also held that a God who is the 
creator of all reality is hard to imagine, but 
that a God who is neither omnipotent nor crea- 
tive (except in the sense that human beings are 
creative) conflicts with no valid metaphysical or 
other doctrine. The principal objection one may 
offer to this discussion is the one already men- 
tioned, that much of it is really little more than 
playing with words. Thus : 

" Could God create a being of such a nature tliat he 
could not subsequently destroy it ? Whatever answer 
we make to this question is fatal to God's omnipotence. 
If we say that he could not create such a being, then 
there is something that he cannot do. If we say that 
he can create such a being, then there is still some- 
thing that he cannot do — to follow such an act of 
creation by an act of destruction " (p. 204). 

This reminds us of the old argument to prove 
that an arrow cannot fly through the air, be- 
cause it cannot move where it is, neither can it 
move where it is not ; and it is about as useful 
to the deist as the latter argument is to the 
physicist. This, however, is rather an extreme 
instance ; and there is much else in the chapters 
well worth reading. Chapter VIII. treats of 
Theism and Happiness, and there is a short 
Conclusion, in which it is held that metaphysics 
may yet show the way out of the fundamental 
difficulties encountered in the course of the dis- 
cussion, ending with a quotation from Spinoza : 
" If the way which I have pointed out as lead- 
ing to this restdt seems exceedingly hard, it may 
nevertheless be discovered. . . . But all things 
excellent are as difficult as they are rare."

Two New Books on Mary Stuart.* 



Here and there in the history of nations a 
character is found around which is gathered an 
atmosphere of such intense human interest that 
the lapse of years adds to rather than weakens 
its charm. Such a character is that of Mary 
Stuart. So much has been written about her, 
and the subject has been approached from so 
many different points of view, that one might 
have thought it impossible either to say any- 
thing new or to put the old facts in a light that 
woidd attract attention. Yet even within the 
last few years the books and articles devoted to 
the life and character of Mary Queen of Scots 
would make a respectable little library ; and now 
we have before us two additional biographies, 
both of which, it is safe to say, will appeal to a 
large circle of readers. Without detracting from 
the merits of the books themselves, it may be 
said that much of their popidarity will be due 
simply to the fact that they tell the story of one 
of the most fascinating and puzzling women in 
the history of all times, — a woman who, what- 
ever her faults (and they were serious enough) , 
has always held a large sliare of the world's 
sympathy. The same qualities which won for 
Mary, at every stage of her life and under the 
most forbidding circumstances, the warm affec- 
tion and ardent partisanship of men and women 
alike, appeal to-day with scarcely diminished 
force. 

It is a commonplace, whether just or other- 
wise, that the most severe judges of women are 
women. Yet of the two books now under con- 
sideration, one by a man, the other by a woman, 
the latter is the more sympathetic, and also the 
more convincing. After reading the two, one 
feels that while the former presents an admirably 
just and impartial picture of the reign of Mary 
Queen of Scots, the latter brings us into inti- 
mate contact with the woman herself, with all 
her weaknesses, all her faults, and all her charm. 
Despite the care and skill with which Mr. Hen- 
derson has marshalled his facts, one lays down 
his two volumes with a certain feeling of dis- 
appointment. He has overloaded his pages with 
detail ; he has devoted so much time and thought 
to the background of the picture, and to the 
accessories, that the central figure is shadowy 
and lifeless. Miss Maccunn, on the other hand, 
has subordinated everything else to her main

figure, and the result is a portrait glowing with 
animation. Apart from certain minor points of 
difference, the two biographies agree substan- 
tially in the facts of Mary's life, as well as in 
the interpretation of the motives of the Queen 
of Scots, and of those who crossed her path for 
good or evil. But neither the presentation of 
facts, however skilful, nor the interpretation of 
motives, however subtle, is in itself potent to 
re-create an individual character. The power 
to accomplish that, — to reconstruct not only 
the life but the personality, — is something quite 
apart. It requires the possession of that gift 
of imagination which is a part of genius. We 
woidd be glad, did space permit, to illastrate 
this by means of quotations in the present case ; 
to show how Miss Maecunn has succeeded where 
so many have failed. The living Mary Stuart 
that we meet with in her pages is not created 
in a moment ; her personality reveals itself 
gradually, as we read her story. We feel that 
the woman here portrayed, so virile, so emi- 
nently human, who loved and hated so vehem- 
ently, who sinned so grievously and suffered for 
her sins so intensely, is no figment of the imagi- 
nation, but the true Mary Stuart. 

" She unaffectedly loved the stir of camps, the fierce 
joy of fighting, the eager pursuit of revenge. . . . She 
never lacked dignity nor presence of mind. Anger she 
showed, and sorrow, but never vanity nor indecision, 
nor any of the more ignoble faidts. Yet it was the 
woman of the warmer heart, the more generous hand, 
the finer nature, who was to meet with treachery and 
ingratitude on all hands, wlule neither her caprice nor 
her shameless disloyalty were to deprive Elizabeth of 
the most devoted and efficient ser\4ces ever rendered 
to a crown." 

Of Elizabeth, we get this striking characteri- 
zation : 

" She had, as it were, an instinct divining the thought 
of her people and prescient of their destiny ; she used 
the large full utterance characteristic of the time, she 
shared its audacity, its love of adventure; she won the 
heart of England." 

Miss Maecunn is equally happy in her pic- 
tures of the other cliaracters, large and small, 
who influenced Mary's life. Darnley and Both- 
well, Murray and John Knox, the ambassadors 
Lethington, Throckmorton, and Randolph, the 
four faithfid Maries, and many others, move 
through these pages, not as mere wooden pup- 
pets, but as living men and women, with himian 
virtues and human vices. 

Something has been said as to the limitations 
of Mr. Henderson's book, but a wrong impression 
would be created if the re^^ewer failed to note 
its value as a contribution to the literature of 
its subject. As Mr. Henderson justly says in his 



Preface, " The recent concise biographies, what- 
ever their special merits, and the more impor- 
tant works lately published on special aspects of 
the subject, so far from forestalling, rather sug- 
gest the desirability of a biography dealing in a 
somewhat detailed and critical fashion with the 
main episodes of Mary's career"; and it is just 
such a detailed and critical narrative that he has 
given us. He has brought together for the first 
time many facts that were formerly to be sought 
only in scattered and more or less inaccessible 
books or magazine articles, and he has added 
not a little entirely new matter, important to a 
proper understanding of the life of Mary Stuart 
and of those aroimd her. 

To the historical student of the period, no 
portion of Mr. Henderson's book will be more 
interesting than Appendix A, in which he dis- 
cusses the latest phase of the Casket Contro- 
versy, with especial reference to Mr. Lang's 
" Mystery of Mary Stuart." With unanswer- 
able logic and atlmirable good humor, he pulls 
to pieces Mr. Lang's ingenious argument for 
the partial forgery of the famous Glasgow 
Letter, and pokes unmerciful fim at the hair- 
splitting reasoning by which Mr. Lang upbudds 
his frail castle in the air. If the subject were 
not one of those fascinating problems that 
continue to tempt the ingenuity of scholars, no 
matter how exhaustively they may have been 
thrashed out, one would be tempted to say that 
Mr. Henderson has finally disposed of the ques- 
tion of the authenticity of the Casket Letters. 

We cannot close without drawing particidar 
attention to the number and excellence of the 
illustrations in both these books. The care 
bestowed nowadays on the adequate illustration 
of books of history, biography, and other classes 
of literature that a few years ago could boast of 
nothing more attractive or iUuminating than a 
map or frontispiece, is one of the most striking 
and commendable developments in present-day 
bookmaking. Lawrence J. Burpee. 



Europe at the Close of the liAST 
Century.* 



Mr. Rose's previous historical studies have 
been so largely centred in the Napoleonic era, 
that it seems at first a matter for surprise that 
he shoidd now produce a work dealing with 
European history in the last thirt}^ years of the 
nineteenth century. He has been heretofore

the specialist, writing of a limited epoch. In 
the present study he attempts the role of the 
general historian. The results of his work must 
therefore be estimated by wholly different stand- 
ai*ds from those applied to his earlier writings. 
In short, Mr. Rose's former work appealed to 
and met the approval of the student of history, 
while he now seeks rather the approval of the 
general reader. 

In very many respects, the author has suc- 
ceeded in his new field ; for the presentation of 
a general renume^ into which are woven the 
results of monographic studies by others, and 
by Mr. Rose as weU, really constitutes a new 
and valuable bit of work. The labor of collating 
and determining the value of the numerous 
essays and articles bearing on minute points in 
recent history must have been tremendous in 
itself, and it involved a genuine historical study 
by the author. Much genius is displayed also 
in the clever manner in which such isolated 
monographic results are bound together so as to 
form a consecutive and attractive narrative, 
while wholly new impressions are received of 
some of the great political characters of the 
period. In clearness of presentation, Mr. Rose's 
work is not surpassed by any general history of 
Modem Europe, and its general readableness is 
in but a few instances marred by detail, where 
detail was neither necessary nor useful, — a 
faidt of the Introduction, which contains too 
much condensed food for the general reader, 
while for the better informed it is but a review. 

Three points upon which Mr. Rose's own 
study leads him to new conclusions are con- 
nected with the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. 
First, he is convinced that the preliminary 
eng-agements for mutual aid between Austria 
and France had reached a much more definite 
basis than has been customarily asserted, and 
that the two Emperors and their military ad- 
visers had arrived at an agreement not fully 
known to their diplomats and ministers. The 
positive belief that Austria woidd help France 
when once war was under way largely explains 
the seeming precipitancy of the war party in 
France in urging hostilities. Second, Bismarck 
has alwaj^s denied that he used the candidacy 
of Prince Leopold to the Spanish throne to stir 
up war with France. Mr. Rose asserts that he 
did so use it, even against the wishes of King 
William, and of the Prince himself ; m short, 
that Bismarck mstigated the candidacy and 
hurried it on for the sole purpose of bringing 
on war as rapidly as possible. The proof offered 
here is wholly inferential, and the results seem 



too broadly and too positively stated ; but cer- 
tainly the author makes the inference seem 
extremely probable. And, third, the usual story 
of the Ems telegram — a story originating with 
Bismarck himself, to the effect that by changing 
the wording of a telegram a mildly expressed 
message was transformed into an offensive one, 
thus preventing any chance of pacific overtures 
— is characterized as nonsense by Mr. Rose, 
and his contention is supported by presenting 
the texts of both messages. There can be no 
doubt that the original was much more forcible, 
and offensive even, in language than Bismarck's 
" edited " despatch. Stated thus briefly, these 
incidents may seem to have had but petty im- 
portance ; but they both represent the care in 
study evinced in this work, and are in truth of 
real value historically, since they offer new inter- 
pretations of disputed points and help to a 
clearer understanding of leading characters. The 
account given of the events of the war itself is 
clear and straightforward, but in this the author 
is less successful than when explaining men and 
motives. 

Probably greater interest will attach to-day 
to what the author has to say about Russia and 
Russian conditions. His account does not in- 
clude the recent war ^vith Japan, nor the sub- 
sequent revolutionary risings. He wrote, in fact, 
before that war had taken place ; and for this 
very reason his estimate of the character of the 
Russian government, and of the leaders and 
the people, is perhaps more interesting than if 
he had had recent events to guide his interpreta- 
tion. In treating of the development of Niliilism 
which followed the popular discontent with the 
results of the war of 1878, he offers an analysis 
equally applicable, if true, to the existing 
situation : 

" The Slav peoples that form the great bulk of her 
[Russia's] population are notoriously sensitive. Shut 
up for nearly half the year by the rigors of winter, they 
naturally develop habits of brooding introspection or 
coarse animalism, — witness the plaintive strains of 
their folk-songs, the pessimism that haunts their litera- 
ture, and the dram-drinking habits of the peasantry. 
The Muscovite temperament and the Muscovite climate 
naturally lead to idealist strivings against the hardships 
of life or a dull grovelling amongst them. Melancholy 
or vodka is the outcome of it all." 

And to this Mr. Rose adds that the Russian 
humiliation resulting from the war, the blow to 
self-confidence and esteem, were revenged by 
revolution upon the incapable government that 
had betrayed the nation. Mr. Rose's dramatic 
statement in support of his assumption that 
climate and geographical conditions are respon- 
sible for the people's character and acts is 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



65 



hardly convincing, and seems rather an attract- 
ive generalization than a sound analysis. But 
the insistence that national humiliation is the 
great, if not the greatest, factor in producing 
revolution, is a truth easily proved by a refer- 
ence to many other states besides Russia, and is 
an element in the present Russian situation fre- 
quently overlooked by writers and investigators. 
Until now, the greatest strength of the Russian 
government has been the implicit confidence of 
the mass of the people in their rulers. To-day 
the spell is broken ; for, as Mr. Rose puts it, 
writing of an earlier epoch, " The jiathetic 
devotion of her peasantry has not made up for 
the mental and moral defects of her governing 
classes." 

The dangers of historical prophecy are well 
exemplified in the author's statement of reasons 
for the lack of any great revolution in Europe 
since the Paris Conunune in 1871. After ask- 
ing "What is the reason for this ? " he answers : 

" Mainly, it would seem, the enormous powers given 
to the modem organized State by the discoveries of 
mechanical science and the triumphs of the engineer. 
Telegraphy now flashes to the capital the news of a 
threatening revolt in the hundredth part of the' time 
formerly taken by couriers with their relays of horses. 
Fully &s great is the sa^dng of time in the transport of 
large bodies of troops to the disaffected districts. Thus, 
the all-important factors that make for success — force, 
skill, and time — are all on the side of the central Gov- 
ernments." 

After acknowledging that the spread of demo- 
cratic and constitutional ideas has been a pre- 
ventative also of revolution, he adds : 

"The fact, however, that there has been no wide- 
spread revolt in Russia since the year 1863, shows that 
democracy has not been the chief influence tending to 
dbsolve or suppress discontent. As we shall see in a 
later chapter, Russia has defied constitutionalism and 
ground down alien races and creeds; yet (up to the 
year 1904) no great rising has shaken her autocratic 
system to its base. This seems to prove that the im- 
munity of the present age in regard to insurrections is 
due rather to the triumphs of mechanical science than 
to the progress of democracy. The fact is not pleasing 
to contemplate; but it must be faced." 

Such an analysis is, of course, partially over- 
thrown by recent events in Russia ; yet in the 
main the causes for the quiet under which Eu- 
rope has rested are correctly stated, and it may 
indeed be asserted that revolution in Russia was 
largely possible because of the breaking down 
of centralized administrative machinery. Still 
the fact remains that Mr. Rose foretold no rev- 
olutionary movement of magnitude in Russia, 
but rather desperate isolated attempts by assassi- 
nation to further a political propaganda. Cer- 
tainly, however, the dictimi of Mr. Rose in 1904 



would have met with general acceptance if it 
were not for the totally unexpected develop- 
ments of 1906. 

The points noted and illustrations given do 
but scant justice to the charm and effectiveness 
of Mr. Rose's first volume. It is both a contri- 
bution to historical knowledge and is distinctly 
readable ; for the author has put his personality 
and his enthusiasm into the work, and one feels 
the attraction of a keen mind absorbed in active 
study. But in all frankness it must be said that 
the second volume is of a distinctly lower grade 
than the first. There is in it a note of weari- 
ness of the task. It is correct and up to date, 
but the language is less vivid. Possibly the loss 
in charm Ls really due to the fact that the topics 
treated in the second volume are so recent as to 
permit of little but an ordinary straightforward 
narrative of events ; for here the materials for 
historical study are lacking, and here also acute 
and positive analysis is impossible. But both 
volimaes are always and everywhere absolutely 
simple and clear, so that concise and correct 
information on whatever of importance pertains 
to modem European history, within the period 
covered, is available to anyone.

In a poem of two hundred and twenty-four Spen-

heartfelt tribute to an institution, a man, and an in- 
tellectual epoch. The title of the poem is " Corydon," 
and it is fiui;her described as '' an elegy in memory 
of ^Matthew Arnold and Oxford." This accounts for 
two of the three parts of his programme ; the other 
is accounted for by the sections that summarize such

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



Morris, and Burne-Jones. The spiritual progenitors 
of these men — Homer, Plato, Sophocles, and Mar- 
cus Aurelius, Goethe, Byi-on, and Wordsworth — 
also receive attention in succinct stanzas of charac- 
terization. On the whole, the poem, which seems 
over-long in comparison with the " Thyrsis " that 
inspired it, is not too long for its theme, thus broadly 
considered, and it is executed in all its parts with 
a degree of finish that removes any occasion for 
apology. For, despite a certain monotony of diction, 
it is a very beautiful poem, informed with high 
seriousness, and the embodiment of ripe reflection 
upon the deeper meanings of art and life. Since 
Arnold is its central theme, our quotation shall be 
of the two stanzas that set forth his essential char- 
acteristics : 

" O nature strangely blent ; light petulance 
Of airy laughter ; buoyant ease urbane 
Of world and youth ; the lucid lips of France ; 
Some breath of Byron's sick romantic pain, 
Dispassionate, purged ; bright cynic-edged disdain 
Of Heine, clean, unpoignant ; peace austere, 
Wordsworth's high woodland peace, unrapturous, sane ; 
Goethe's grave calm Olympian ; Attic clear 

Vision and wistful doubt and Stoic will severe ! 

" He saw life broken, but with steady smile, 
Which is the mask of men that only weep. 
Facing grey shadows, stooped not to beguile 
Clear courage with drugged dreams, or purchase sleep 
Painless for haunting inward hurt, too deep. 
Ah me ! for song's redemption. If but part 
He saw, and would too lightly overleap 
Time's deep-set boundaries, buoyed by airy art. 

For his pure vision's flaw he paid a broken heart." 

Mr. Bernard Drew's "Cassandi*a and Other 
Poems " is a volume of verse inspired by abstract 
and bookish themes. It is coldly correct in diction, 
and rather commonplace in thought, although the 
author has caught the trick of minor verse-writing 
successfully enough to produce now and then a fairly 
acceptable piece of derivative workmanship. Such, 
for example, is this irregular sonnet on "Twilight": 

" O'er earth and heaven the slow long twiliglit eve 

Deepens and trembles through the summer haze ; 

The distant hills faint out before the gaze. 
With all the legends of the years engraven 
The sea sings softly in the little haven 

Of ancient glories bred of ancient days, 

And hidden channels and old ocean ways 
That thunderous water-surges watch and weave. 

The sinking crimson o'er the cliff-capped bay 
Sheds light athwart the wave ; the twinkling stars 

Steal slowly forth upon the path of Day ; 
The eastern steeds that drew Sol's golden cars 

Vanish amid the shadows faint and grey 
Before the Evening's flaming scimitars." 

It is the sort of verse that any person of education 
and sensibility can write if he wishes, verse having 
no originality of thought or imagery, and no individ- 
uality of utterance. 

" The Cloud Kingdom " is the realm wherein the 
feathered denizens of the air disport themselves and 
rule supreme. The volume to which Mr. I. Henry 
Wallis has given this title is a collection of about 
thirty bird-poems, intertwining delicate fancies with 
graceful verse, and expressing, now the naive thought 



of childhood, now the more sober reflectiveness of 
riper years. The exquisite charm of this work may 
best be illustrated by " The Sparrow." 

" Among the carven images 

On God's great house of prayer, 
A statue of the Virgin is. 

And our dear Lord is there. 
Close to his Mother does he lie. 

And answers her caress 
Witli loving little hands that try 

Against her cheek to press. 

" A circling aureole has He, 

To tell His name to all ; 
A circling aureole has She 

Round her brows virginal ; 
And on this circlet that She has 

A sparrow's nest is made 
Of hay and straw and stalks of grass 

From street and close conveyed. 

" It seems as though that nest were there 

That He might look on it, 
For always is He gazing where 

The mother-bird does sit. 
And should her little fledglings fall, 

Most sui'ely will He know ; 
And of His love which blesseth all 

Some comfort will bestow. 

" The mystic Dove broods over them ; 

And Angel-faces shine 
Around the Star of Bethlehem 

Above the Babe divine. 
About are fiends with mouths awry 

And twisted faces wild ; 
But safe from them the nest is by 

The Mother and her Child. 

" The sparrows fly into the street 

'Mid turmoil, sin and shame ; 
Unheeded by the crowds they meet. 

Who care not whence they came ; 
Who know not of the nest that is 

In the Angel-land above. 
Beside the Holy Presences, 

Beneath the brooding Dove. 

" But it may be that unto some 

Who love each living thing. 
And smile to see the sparrows come, 

A happy thought they bring. 
And as to their high home they go, 

A child with upward glance 
May see their nest, and her face glow 

With Heavenly radiance." 

The happiest inspirations of Coleridge and of Blake 
are fairly matched by these tender and lovely verses. 
In graver mood is penned the song to "The Night- 
ingale," with the first two stanzas of which we must 
fain be content. 

" As one beneath the apple bloom at ease 
May read of palm trees and of orchid flowers, 
Or one who idles through the summer hours 
In some sweet Devon Coombe — may dream of seas 
That wind up island creeks to fragrant bowers 
Beneath the Southern Cross, — so we, the tale 
Hear, of the music of the Nightingale. 

" Too partial ! Why wiU he not come to us ? 
Wide are our woodlands, and the lanes thereby 
Grass-grown and lush-leaved under hedges high ; 
And heaths of gorse and broom are plenteous. 
Yet, when Antares climbs our Southern sky. 
And sedge-birds are awake, we still must fail 
To hear the singing of the Nightingale."

THE DIAL

There are birds arplenty in the volume of songs 
called " White Poppies," but they are strange ex- 
otic creatures, mynas and bulbuls and casuareens. 
These lyrics are airy trifles, voicing the moods of an 
exile under Eastern skies. The rhymes " To Mary " 
are pretty enough to quote. 

" Could I return across the sea. 

Like some bold Knight of Faery 
Whose wishes are his wings, and be 
As light as he and airy ; 

" Ah, th«n, beside the kitchen fire, 
Or in the shining dairy. 
Or where each happy woodland choir 
Of song is never chary ; 

" Now, ere the summer yet be done. 
Or warm south winds be wary, 
I would out-race the setting sun 
Once more to see you, Mary." 

Other maidens, however, seem at times to occupy 
the poet's fancy, as the lines called " Orange Blos- 
soms " attest. 

" As I rode out with blue-eyed Blanche, 

She reached her hand up to a branch. 

And plucked a bunch of orange blooms. 
' I love,' she said, ' all sweet perfumes ; 

But this I love the most of all.' 

I answered, while (delicious thrall I) 

She pinned them to her pretty vest. 

That I should like the blossoms best 

Enwreath'd for me around her hair 

Before a certain altar stair." 

But perhaps Blanche is, after all, only another name . 
for Mary, and merely the tribute paid to the exi- 
gency of a needed rhyme. 

" The Fading of the Mayflower " comes to us — ' 
not exactly as a voice from the grave, since Mr. ; 
Theodore TUton still lives in the honorable retire- ; 
ment of age — but as a voice from a past that now ■ 
seems remote indeed, the past of the New England 
lyceum, the abolitionist crusade, and the Civil War. . 
It is a voice of admonition, raised in earnest protest i 
and with satirical accent, against the mad worship i 
of money which is so marked a characteristic of the : 
present generation. In a cycle of one hundred and ; 
fourteen sonnets (some of them slightly irregular), ' 
the wTiter conti-asts the stern idealism of the puritans 
who founded New England with the lax degeneracy ; 
of their descendants. This is the fashion of his dis- ; 
course : • 

" Thus, to our arbute, owe we all our East, ; 

And half our North, and half of half our West — ; 

Until, of flowers, our Mayflower is the best — ; 

Except our Lord's own lilies I We at least : 

May love it next to these I ... Or have we ceased i 

To pin it in onr cap • — to manifest ! 

(As by an edelweiss) a soul at rest ; 

But when it climbs ? . . . Alas, our sacred Beast ! 

Is what we bow to ! Much art thou adored, •, 

Grolden Calf I Thy wide-encroaching rule • 

In all our fifty commonwealths is rife ! 

We dote upon thee ! Look ! Our golden hoard ' 

Out-fortunes Fortnnatus I . . . He — a fool ! — ■ 

To save his wallet, forfeited his life ! " i 

The staccato diction here exemplified characterizes ' 
the work throughout. The homiletic value of the 



sonnets is considerable, and they embody much 
quaint information and homely wisdom, but they 
almost never appeal to us as poetry. 

Another poem of essentially didactic character, 
an ambitious poem composed in a spirit of high 
seriousness, is Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole's "The 
Building of the Organ." In form, this work is a sym- 
phony in five movements and many themes. The 
themes are provided with tempo marks, in further- 
ance of the musical analogy upon which the poem 
is based. Mr. E. F. FenoUosa, it will be remem- 
bered, made a similar experiment in " The Discovery 
of America," published in 1893, and quite recently 
the experiment has again been attempted by Mr. 
Charles E. Russell in ''The Twin Immortalities." 
These works, as well as the one now to be consid- 
ered, all exemplify the aim which Mr. Dole describes 
as that of giving " to English verse a new medium 
of expression, plastic and elastic, capable of infinite 
variet}', and as well adapted to the genius of the 
Language as the classic Ode was to Greek in the hands 
of a Pindar." We have called Mr. Dole's poem 
ambitious, and this statement clearly warrants the 
epithet. In judging *' The Building of the Organ " 
as an artistic performance, we must keep in mind 
the special conditions imposed by the task, one of 
which is that a certain bareness of diction is de- 
manded, for the author had ever in mind the possi- 
bility that his words might be sung as well as read, 
and, as he justly remarks, " there are many words in 
English which cannot be sung." It would not be 
fair, that is, to deal with this poem and ignore the 
fundamental principle of its composition, any more 
than it would be fair to deal similarly with Lanier's 
" Centennial Cantata " or with the book of a music- 
drama by Richard Wagner. With this qualification 
in mind, we shoidd say that Mr. Dole had produced 
a remarkable piece of work, not subtle, allusive, or 
even melodious in the ordinary poetical sense, but 
thoughtful, finely imaginative, and stately in move- 
ment. Its general theme is peace and the brother- 
hood of man, and its ethical burden is of the noblest. 
We quote a fugal theme (andante moestoso) by way 
of illustration. 

" Hark ! like a golden thread of sound aerial 
A plaintive cadence from the Organ steals ; 
It trembles, rises, floats away ethereal I 
The Soul in silent prayer devoutly kneels I 

" Then comes a change : a crash of chords rolls thundering 
And shakes the windows in their leaded panes ; 
It tJirills the throng who listen breathless-wondering. 
To hear the splendour of the sequent strains. 

" From out the chaos of the weird prophetical 
Emerges like the crystal Light of Life 
A fervid theme, spontaneous, poetical. 

That singB of strenuous Victory won from Strife. 

" With deeper tones the same great theme euphonions 
Ensues enmesht in woof of woven sounds, 
Thus grows the Fugue ; a splendid web harmonious 
With a whole world of Beauty in its bounds," 

The variety of metres employed by Mr. Dole for 
his effects is extraordinary, and no less so the tech-

nical skill with which he uses them. The symphonic 
poem " Onward," appended to the volume, illustrates 
upon a lesser scale the methods and ideas that are 
exploited in the larger work. 

About five years ago, we took note of " Song- 
Surf," a slender volume of lyrics by Mr. Cale Young 
Rice, characterized chiefly by an unpleasant turgidity 
of diction. Mr. Rice now presents us with a stout 
and very handsome volume containing the better of 
the early lyrics, many new ones, and two plays in 
verse, '' Yolanda " and " David." His work in this 
larger compass and maturer form deserves far more 
praise than could be accorded to those first fruits, 
and gives us much sincere and conscientious work- 
manship. The old straining for effect is still ap- 
parent, although far less so than formerly, and many 
examples of commonplace and oddity occur, the 
elimination of which would have been to the author's 
profit. " At Amalfi " is the poem we choose for 
quotation. 

" Come to the window, you who are mine. 
Waken ! the night is calling. 
Sit by me here — with the moon's fair shine 
Into your deep eyes falling. 

" The sea afar is a fearful gloom ; 
Lean from the casement, listen ! 
Anear, it breaks with a faery spume, 
Spraying the moon-path's glisten. 

" The little white town below lies deep 
As eternity in slumber. 

O, you who are mine, how a glance can reap 
Beauties beyond all number ! 

" 'Amalfi ! ' say it — as the stars set 
O'er yon far promontory. 
'Amalfi ! ' . . . Shall we ever forget 
Even Above this glory ? 

" No ; as twin sails at anchor ride, 
Our spirits rock together 
On a sea of love — lit as this tide 
With tenderest star-weather. 

" And the quick ecstasy within 
Your breast is against me beating. 
' Amalfi ! ' . . . Never a night shall win 
From God again such fleeting. 

" Ah — but the dawn is redd'ning up 
Over the moon low-dying. 
Come, come away — we have drimk the cup : 
Ours is the dream undying." 

This affords a typical illustration of both the strength 
and weakness of Mr. Rice's verse. It also shows 
how definitely he has been influenced by the method 
of Robert Browning. 

Dr. Edward Robeson Taylor's new volume con- 
tains the long poem "Into the Light," published 
five years ago, a few other reprinted pieces, and 
much new matter. It is quite fitting that the trans- 
lator of " Les Trophies " should have given us a 
sonnet on the death of Heredia last October. 

" Vainly you'll call importunate and long 
On him to add fresh jewels to his store. 
For muse-beloved he dwells forevermore 
With all the crowned ones of his deathless song. 



And in the midst of that imperial throng, 
Now newly splendored by his sonnet-lore, 
Fame gently seats him and delights to score 
Her beadroU with his name in letters strong ; 

For though he felt not passion's noblest ire 

That bears the uttered thought on wings of fire, 
Nor made his numbers all the vastness sweep, 

Yet he was Art's, and drank of her desire, 
Until Imagination, true and deep, 
Burst into beauty on his flawless lyre." 

A number of translations from Leconte de Lisle 
and other modern French poets are included among 
the contents of this volume. 

" The Far Country " is a volume of verse of un- 
usual quality, the work of Miss Florence Wilkinson. 
It is verse of varied inspiration, giving us now an 
impression de voyage, now a suggestion of old-time 
balladry and romance, now an outpouring of deep 
feeling. A tendency toward forced forms of ex- 
pression and an indulgence in mere emotional ejacu- 
lation appear to be the most noticeable faults of 
what is, on the whole, a volume of quite exceptional 
richness and strength. The stanzas " In a Ruined 
Abbey " may be taken as an example of Miss Wil- 
kinson's best work. 

" The moon blows toward the broken tower, 

A winged sphere of fire, 
And through the ivy over-streaming 

Rose-window, arch, and crumbling choir 
Trembles the wind in ecstasy 

His fingers of desire. 

" Where lords and ladies long ago 

— Yolande and Mordred, — 
Knelt pale before the crucifix, 

With bells upflung and incense shed, , 

Now many a pink-tipped daisy lifts 

Its fair unknowing head. 

" Where scutcheons gleamed, and lance and helm, 

Trophies of sacred fight, 
And the great windows gloomed and glowed 

Like jewels dusky-bright — 
The eternal hills look gravely through 

These arches of the night. 

" A thousand memories walk tiptoe, 

Sainted, occult, unspelt ; 
An elder time's development ; 

Like mists that blow and melt, 
So we that stray here hand in hand 

Have on our foreheads dimly felt 
The chrysmal kiss processional 

Of Presences that knelt. 

" The moon shakes at the unportalled door, 

A sailing sphere of fire ; 
The shadows lie all breathlessly 

Still as intense desire. 
Beloved, — thus our hearts are hushed 

Yet mounting ever higher, 
Until they mix in one clear note, — 
(0 lyric heart, to sing, to float ! ) 

Heaven-smitten like a lyre." 

The picturesque manner of this poem is perhaps 
more characteristic of Miss Wilkinson's verse than 
any other, but she has also a manner in which the 
reflective element is dominant, and this we may 
illustrate by the poem entitled " Forerunners."

" In the first sleep-watch of the night 
With dreams that flit and hesitate, 
Hark for the tokens of our flight, 
Lost voices seeking each his mate ; 

" A hurrying step along the road, 
A knock, a cry, but only one. 
' Nay, heed them not. for they shall be 
Forgotten with the morning sun.' 

" These are the tokens of our flight ; 
We, nameless ones who go before, 
Who stop to call a comrade sonl 
But find no latch at any door. 

" That drifting smoke across the plain. 
That footfall fading by the sea, 
Perchance our camp fires dying out. 
Our passionate steps no more to be. 

" The vagrant red of Autumn leaf, 
The haunting echo and its grief. 
Luring you on from hill to hill, 
The vagrant red, the wandering sigh, 
It is the life-blood that we spill. 

'' Yet we are nameless before God ; 
We have nor grave nor epitaph ; 
And where we pteiished of our thirst, 
Yea, where there was no drop to qua£F, 
A spring shall gnsh from our dead bonea 
And full-fed ones sit down and laugh." 

The stout and faithful heart pursuing the forlorn 
and elusive hope — it has been the theme of much 
inspiring verse, and it is •«'ith no mean company 
that the poem we have just quoted claims its rightful 
place. 

"In Sun and Shade," by Miss Louise Morgan 
Sill, may be described as typical magazine verse. 
''In Verona " will do for a representative selection. 

" Soft air, soft fountains, warmed with sun 

And thrilling to their overflow, 
Where red and white the marbles gleam, 
And mould'ring lions crouch and dream 

Of deeds forgotten long ago. 

" And near lived Juliet — passionate 

With love and sorrow — neither child 

Nor woman, beautiful and doomed . . . 

WTiat showers of almond-buds have bloomed 
Since love that loyal soul b^;niled ! 

" Now, where she dwelt, g^y dancers turn 

With tripping steps to a guitar, 
Oblivious of the spirit sweet 
Wlio haunts the garden and the street. 

Or trims her lamp in yonder star. 

" Yet what are marbles, rich and worn, 

And what is all Verona's pride 
Of pompous power and holy art 
To that enraptured, tragic heart 

That lived for love and for love died ? 

" Lilt of guitar and fountain's song, 

Your music haunts me, and the breath 

Of almond-blossoms brings to me 

Verona's fragrant memory 

Of love that died and smiled at death." 

A few Hawaiian songs give a somewhat distinct- 
ive note to '• The Visionary, and Other Poems," by 
Miss Christine Siebeneck Swayne. Otherwise, the 



pieces are of the conventional sort upon conventional 
themes. "We quote " Lost Atlantis " for its imagi- 
native quality. 

" The blind snake crawls along the walls 
Of tower and turret ages buried ; 
The ground swell laps within the gaps 
Of the long rampart rough and serried. 

" There clings white brine upon the shrine 
Within the temple's wave-worn glory, 
And white things creep in slime, and ^eep 
Upon the tablet's graven story. 

" Soft silence reigns in these domains 

Where once the trumpet rang so loudly ; 
And pallid gleams of phosphor beams 

Glow where the sun once glittered proudly. 

" Oh, love, they lie beneath no sky. 

Who fell by field and hill and river — 
The wild seas roll from pole to pole. 
And surfs above them boom forever." 

The imitation of a Tennysonian model is auda> 
ciously obvious, but the poem is striking enough to 
arrest attention on its own account. 

Miss BirchaU's " Book of the Singing Winds " 
is a tiny book of outdoor verse, full of the vagabond 
spirit, and unpretentiously charming. This song 
"A la Belle Etoile" will waken a responsive echa 
in many breasts. 

" Oh, who will lodge at my Inn to-night. 
And live both fair and fine, 
With a blossoming blackberry vine for a gate. 
And a friendly star for a sign ? 

" Giood sir, my Inn is a gentle Tnn^ 
The wine is sweet and old ; 
'Tis Adam's, sir, with a fine bonqnet, 
And the colour of liquid gold. 

" The carriages roll on the rocky road 
To a musty house afar ; 

But the gentlefolk stop by the blackberry gate 
At the Inn of the Beautiful Star. 

" Sweet fern, sweet fern for your pillow, rir. 
And a quick-eared fann for your mate. 
And a firefly's light for your candle bright — 
Good sooth, we sleep in state. 

" The winds go murmuring by at dusk 
And call you up at dawn. 
To walk through the fairies' handkerchief 
And startle a sleeping fawn. 

" When day is red on the river's bed, 
And bright on quartz and spar, 
Well say our short St. Martin's grace 
At the Inn of the Beautifnl Star. 

" The blackberry vine is a maiden now, 
With her pale stars in the dew ; 
Come back next month, good sir, therell be 
Sweet blackberries for you. 

" Well wish you luck from the blackberry gate. 
Although you wander far 
'TIS here that you 11 come home at last — 
To our Inn of the Beautiful Star." 

There are several other pieces as good as this, and. 
for once we find the word "arbutus" correctly 



accented.

The delights In her new book, "The Garden, 
T^g^dm°^ You and I" (Macmillan), " Bar- 
vacation." bara " (now identified as Mrs. Mabel 

Osgood Wright) has, according to the announce- 
ments, gone back to the methods of her first anony- 
Tnous success, " The Garden of a Commuter's 
Wife." But the reader looking for this may be dis- 
appointed, for somewhat is lacking of the freshness 
and spontaneity of Barbara's first appearance. In 
fact, the form in which the present book is cast, 
comprising a series of long letters with their equally 
long replies full of garden information and advice, 
is forced and unnatm-al. Nevertheless, it would be 
ungracious to find only faults in a book whose pri- 
mary object is exactly that of giving advice and 
information, eminently sane, and showing evidence 
of practical knowledge. The purpose of the corre- 
spondence is to afford opportunity for the experi- 
enced Barbara to give of her more abundant 
knowledge to Mary Penrose, who with her husband 
is having a "garden vacation," camping in an old 
open barn in their own grounds. If young Mrs. 
Penrose, an avowed novice, masters the subject with 
remarkable swiftness, and is able to return Barbara's 
suggestions with what appears to be expert knowl- 
edge, the arrangement of the book must again be 
blamed. Mary Penrose's "garden vacation" is a 
delightful arrangement, whereby she and her hus- 
band are enabled to devote to the improvement of 
their out-of-town-home the money that would other- 
wise have been spent in travelling, at the same time 
learning by observation and experiment the joys of 
an out-door life. There are other minor benefits 
that result, but the main achievement is of course 
the building of the garden, revising the old one, 
adding new beauties, and especially replacing upon 
a certain knoll that is an important feature of the 
landscape those trees, shrubs, and undergrowths that 
ought to be there. The young folks are furthered 
in their plans in various ways, as well as by the aid 
of Barbara's friendly letters ; there is " The Man 
from Everywhere," who is superintending a piece 
of engineering that in the clearing away of a certain 
other knoll in the neighborhood supplies the mate- 
rials for planting that of the Penroses ; there is a 
handy but erratic Irish gardener, Larry by name, 
who " happens along," and when his habits become 
too much for him he is succeeded by a melancholy 
German ; and there is a visit to the seaside garden 
of our old friends Martin and Lavinia Cortwright, 
and a further visit in their company to a " garden 
of sweet odors." A thread of romance runs through 
the letters, and the same spirit of sympathy with 
nature that has informed the writer's other volumes 
is evident in the present one. For the sake of the 
garden-lover who reads to learn, it should be said 
that there are several excellent and suggestive lists 
of perennials, annuals, and roses, with explanatory 
notes ; but there is no index. 



Defects of the Invaluable as a historical treatise is 
electoral system Mr. J. Hampden Dougherty's " The 
of the U.S. Electoral System of the United 

States" (Putnam), a comprehensive study of the 
provision of the Constitution relating to the proced- 
ure of counting the electoral vote for President and 
Vice President. The author traces the history and 
practices of Congress as an electoral body, discusses 
the various interpretations placed on the words of 
the Constitution "the votes shall then.be counted" 
following the provision relating to the opening of 
the returns by the President of the Senate, explains 
the Federalist bill of 1800, which, although it never 
became law, was the source of all subsequent rules 
and practices, and describes the provisions of the 
Electoral Count law of 1887. He shows that the 
framers of the Constitution never dreamed that 
the counting of the electoral vote would involve any- 
thing more than a simple process of addition, but 
that in practice it has required the canvassing of 
disputed returns, and this in turn has necessitated 
the decision of such important questions as relate to 
the regularity of votes, the qualifications of electors, 
the right of a state to participate in the choice of 
electors, etc., etc. He very properly pronounces the 
Electoral Count provision as the " weakest spot " in 
the Constitution, declares that it has broken down 
in practice, and asserts that its continuance without 
change is fraught with peril to the country. Instead 
of providing in a passive way that the votes " shall 
be counted," the Constitution should specify the 
canvassing authority and the method of procedure. 
The Electoral Count law of 1887, passed after a 
long struggle following the crisis of 1877, is designed 
to provide by statute against deadlocks in the future ; 
but, as Mr. Dougherty points out, the law is an in- 
strument of compromises believed to be unconstitu- 
tional, is cumbersome in its details, and seriously 
defective in that it neglects to provide how the vote 
of a state shall be saved from rejection when both 
Houses disagree. In the final chapter of his book, 
Mr. Dougherty suggests an amendment to the Con- 
stitution providing for the direct election of the 
President and Vice President by popular vote, each 
state being allowed as many votes as it has Senators 
and Representatives in Congress, the vote to be ascer- 
tained and canvassed by an authority duly consti- 
tuted by the state. The effect of this amendment 
would be to abolish the Electoral College and reduce 
the ultimate count at Washington to a simple mathe- 
matical calculation, as the framers of the Constitu- 
tion intended it should be.

trustworthy life of the Scotch dominie-president has

been written by Dr. Da^-id Walker Woods (Flem- 
ing H. Revell Co.). As a well-known preacker in 
Scotland, of most liberal views, Witherspoon was 
summoned by the trustees of the New Jersey college 
in 1768 to become its head. By accepting the in- 
vitation, Witherspoon gave the author an opportunity 
to make an interesting chapter on the early history 
of the college. The new president entered upon the 
heroic task, not unconmion in later days, of raising 
fimds to pay existing debts and to provide for the 
future of the institution. In this work, he visited 
nearly every Presbyterian congregation in the thir- 
teen colonies. He sent a vessel to Georgia to bring 
to a Northern market the produce which the Pres- 
byterians of that colony could give more easily than 
cash. In addition to financing the college, Wither- 
spoon did most of the teaching. He was professor 
of Hebrew, advanced Greek and Latin, Divinity. 
Moral Philosophy, and Eloquence. During the 
Revolutionary War, when the college was temporarily 
abandoned, Witherspoon served in the Continental 
Congress, signed the Declaration of Independence, 
and took an active part in the instructions to the 
American representatives in forming the treaty of 
1783 which ended the war. He was also active in 
rehabilitating the church and in transforming it into 
the American Presbyterian Church. After the col- 
lege was reopened, the Scoteh dominie continued as 
President until his death in 1794. In the volume 
one notes a few errors, as " Thompson " for Charles 
" Thomson," the Secretary of Congress. The bank 
advocated by Morris could scarcely be called a 
"national" bank. The address to the people of 
Quebec is omitted from the list of papers of the 
First Continental Congress. These are minor criti- 
cisms, and detract little from a biography which will 
appeal to Princeton men and to students of church 
historj-, as well as to those interested in the Revolu- 
tionary period of oxir national life. 

An American " The Philippine Experiences of an 
school-teacher in American Teacher " (Scribner) is a 
the Philippines, y^^ ^^^^ fijg ^^ tj^g -phe author, 

Mr. William B. Freer, describes only his own expe- 
riences ; he does not attempt to solve, or even to 
state, the various Philippine problems ; he says little 
in regard to the general school system of the Phil- 
ippines ; his book is simply a description of the 
Philippine life of one American teacher, and an 
interesting one it is. The educational policy of the 
Americans in the Philippines ha« been severely 
criticised, especially for the attempt to " American- 
ize " the natives in language and institutions. But 
if the experiences of the author of this book be taken 
as typical, it would seem that there should be no 
serious objection to the system. He claims that the 
use of English is justified by the fact that the natives 
have no common language, and that in nearly every 
school there will be pupils who cannot understand 
one another ; few outside of the large towns under- 
stand Spanish ; so for a common language English 
is as good as any. Besides, he says, the people are i 



eager to learn English. The best part of the book 
is that which describes the methods employed by 
I the teachers. The supervising teachers are generally 
j Americans, and under their direction native teachers 
I gfive instruction to the children ; the instruction is 
I all in English, but aims at immediate practical 
results ; American songs are taught, American games 
ajfe played, and over the schools American flags fly ; 
the teachers not only instruct in books, but they give 
much needed advice- as- te^ «a«itation and other 
practical matters. The church authorities, it is said, 
support the work. Incidentally, Mr. Freer writes 
of various other aspects of Philippine life, — the 
religious customs and festivals ; the different races 
of the Islanders ; the home-life and amusements of 
the natives ; native markets ; methods of transpor- 
tation ; characteristics of the natives, especially of 
the children. The author believes that the educa- 
tion now being given is a distinctly elevating force, 
and that the people of all races are eager for it. 
They are more willing than the Indians in the 
United States, and make more progress. Seldom is 
there reference to political affairs, but it is quite 
dear that this teacher is not an anti-imperialist, for 
he does not believe that the Filipinos are capable of 
self-government.

memories that go back now more than forty years. 
Mrs. Martha Derby Perry's " Letters from a Sur- 
geon of the Civil War " ( Little, Brown & Co. ) are 
her husband's letters written home in 1862—64, 
when he served as assistant surgeon with the famous 
Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers. Although 
young and of subordinate rank, Dr. John G. Perry 
seems to have had that in him which invited the 
assignment of difficult duty and the imposition of 
grave responsibilities. His brief and modest letters, 
supplemented by a few editorial insertions, tell a 
story of hardship and danger, especially in the Wil- 
derness campaign and before Petersburg, that might 
easily have tempted another to essay a more ambi- 
tious stj'le. Three very short extracts will show 
the book's quality, and the writer's. " The hardest 
battles I have fought since joining the army," Dr. 
Perry assures his wife, from a comfortless winter 
camp, " have been with myself." Again : " I doubt 
if our ancestors at Valley Forge suffered more from 
cold than we did. I generally marched on foot so 
as to keep warm, and often found that I had been 
sound asleep while my legs were trudging along." 
Still again, speaking of a prayer-meeting held by 
employees and agents of the Sanitary Commission : 
'* The effect was doleful in the extreme, and I never 
want to repeat such an experience while I am in 
the army. Let men pray by themselves as much as 
they please and read their Bibles in solitude, but not 
fill every man's ears with their sins and offences." 
Indications of the ^Titer's nerve and endurance are 
not wanting, such as the setting of his own broken

leg when other surgical aid was not at hand, and his 
dragging the injured member about with him through 
days and nights of hard work and forced marches. 
Mrs. Perry's experience in the New York draft 
riots of 1863 forms a noteworthy chapter. The 
brevity and restraint of both Dr. and Mrs. Perry's 
style almost make the reviewer feel that, for his own 
part, it were better had he " from speech refrained, 
nobility more nobly to repay."

in central Jiiinou 1906) contained an extended re- 
a century ago. ^jg^^ ^y -proi. Frederick J. Turner, 
of a number of volumes of " Early Western Travels," 
that interesting series of reprints which we owe to 
the industry and enthusiasm of Dr. Reuben Gold 
Thwaites. Of the three groups into which these 
volumes fall, one contains the writings of Hulme, 
Woods, Faux, Welby, and Richard Flower, English 
travellers who visited the English settlement which 
was established in Edwards County, Illinois, by 
Morris Birkbeck and George Flower in the year 
1817. There is considerable supplementary literar 
ture bearing on this subject that has not been in- 
cluded in Dr. Thwaites's monumental work ; and 
to these separate publications has now been added 
the " Personal Narrative " of Elias Pym Fordham, 
edited by Mr. Frederic Austin Ogg, and published 
by Messrs. A. H. Clark & Co., Cleveland. Fordham 
was a young English civil engineer, who came over 
with Birkbeck in the spring of 1817, and took 
charge of the equipment which was being trans- 
ported to the new settlement, consisting mainly 
of farming implements and household fxu*niture. 
Though he made an entry of land in the English 
Prairie, and found plenty of occupation, his stay in 
America seems to have been comparatively brief, 
and he soon returned to practise his profession in 
the mother country. The extracts from his letters 
and journal here presented in book form constitute 
an artless but convincing narrative of life in what 
we now call the Middle West, but was then the very 
ragged edge of civilization. He holds no brief 
for either side of the emigration controversy, like 
Birkbeck or Cobbett; is not blind to the crudities 
and graver defects of a frontier people ; but sees, 
more clearly than some of the older heads around 
him, that this is a nation in the making and that it 
is worth making. 

Forty-three years ago, Dean Alford 
und^fi"re!^ stirred the English-speaking world 

with his book on "The Queen's 
English," which was speedily followed by Mr. 
George Washington Moon's animated rejoinder, 
"The Dean's English"; and now there comes, 
anonymously, from the Oxford Press, a sharply 
critical, but sane and good-tempered, treatise on 
"The King's English," which is also evoking con- 
siderable comment and discussion. Its warning 
examples are taken from such esteemed publica- 
tions as the "Spectator," "Times," "Telegraph," 



and " Westminster Gazette," and from the works of 
Jowett, R. L. Stevenson, Huxley, Richard Grant 
White, Mr. Meredith, and many other far from 
careless writers. Like most books on the use of 
language, it offers counsels of perfection; but im- 
possible though it is for poor scribbling and gab- 
bling humanity to live up to them, they can hardly 
fail to effect something toward raising the standard 
of written and spoken English. Of the many de- 
batable questions touched on, that of Americanisms, 
although treated with admirable impartiality, may 
be selected for a word of protest. "The English 
and American language and literature," we are told, 
"are both good things; but they are better apart." 
Is this the right view ? If so, place must be made 
for an Australian, a South- African, and an Anglo- 
Indian language and literature. Why encourage 
this multiplication of languages and literatures, or 
try to retard the glad day, confidently predicted 
by some, when English shall become the world- 
language ? Characteristic and picturesque modes 
of expression will arise on each side of the Atlantic, 
but so they will on each side of the Irish Sea, and 
of the Cheviot Hills, and of the Thames River ; and 
we would not have it otherwise. In the literature 
headed by the names of Chaucer, Spenser, Shake- 
speare, and Milton, we must claim a place for 
Bryant, Whittier, Longfellow, and Lowell. The 
style of " The King's English " attracts rather than 
repels : it is scholarly, pleasantly allusive, and not 
untinged with humor. The authorship is open to 
conjecture, with such clue as is furnished by the 
signatures "H. W. F." and "F. G. F." at the end 
of the preface. 

" A Book of the Riviera" (Dutton), 
by Mr. S. Baring-Gould, is a delight- 
ful work of nineteen chapters and 
forty illustrations, dealing with the Ligiu-ian coast 
between Marseilles and Savona. This region, really 
so ancient, is only about three-quarters of a century 
old as a winter resort. It was rediscovered in 1831 
by Lord Brougham, fleeing from the fogs of England, 
on his way to Naples. Halted there by the vigilance 
of the Sardinian police, lest he should introduce 
cholera into Piedmont, he became so charmed by 
the climate, the sunshine, the flowers, that he bought 
an estate and built himself a winter residence at 
Cannes, then only a fishing-viUage. He talked and 
wrote about the place, and from this beginning dates 
the whole chain of Riviera winter resorts, with their 
villas, hotels, casinos, and shops, which now line the 
shores of the Mediterranean. Extremely modern 
as these places are, both in appearance and reality, 
the object of Mr. Baring-Gould's work is to show 
that they are but the modern fringe on an ancient 
garment, a superficial sprinkling over beds of remote 
antiquity. For example, he has less to say about 
Nice, Monte Carlo, and Monaco, as fashionable re- 
sorts for gambling, than about the Greek city of 
Nike (Victory), and the Monaco which was named 
from Monoikos, the Phoenician god whose temple

anciently crowned this rock, " assuredly the loveliest 
spot on the Ligurian coast." Since there is hardly 
a village or town in the whole region which has not 
treasures for the sketcher or the photographer, as 
well as for the pleasure-seeker, this book, with its 
charming illustrations from photographs, will surely 
satisfy the author's purpose "to interest the many 
visitors to the Ligurian coast in the places which 
they see."

German struggle Bigelow s " History of the German 
for Liberty. Struggle for Liberty" (Harper & 

Bros. ) has recently appeared. Another volume will 
bring the story down to the establishment of the 
present imperial government. Mr. Bigelow speaks 
in his preface of the difficulty of securing infor- 
mation from families possessing it, because of the 
fear that its publication might hinder the profes- 
sional career of its members. He has, nevertheless, 
brought together a vast amount of material — the 
list of titles consulted occupying nearly three closely 
printed pages, and not including the standard works. 
The impression of the book is, however, not one of 
mastery of the subject-matter, rather one of con- 
fusion confounded. With a clear and orderly out- 
line in mind, the reader will be interested in many 
details. But often these smack of "yellow jour- 
nalism," and almost without exception are jumbled 
together in a manner that affords no suggestion of 
a dignified historical narrative. The tone of the 
work is throughout journalistic, often hysterical; 
but some later writer will doubtless find in this mass 
of material abundant matter for a single volume 
that win clearly and logically present the subject 
without sacrificing what has evidently been Mr. 
Bigelow's paramount aim — the readableness and 
popular character of the narrative. 

Development of Another student, M. Louise Green, 
religiout liberty Ph.D., has been delving into the 
in Connecticut, records of early New England, and 
we have as the result "The Development of Re- 
ligious Liberty in Connecticut" (Houghton). The 
work presents a fuU and accurate treatment of an 
important subject, fairly interesting at the start and 
much more so before the close. It goes into strictly 
church history with almost unnecessary fulness, so 
as to be really a history of the Congregational 
Church in Connecticut to 1818. The first chapters, 
on general Congregational and New England his- 
tory, before coming to the proper theme of the book, 
are largely a threshing over of old straw. Though 
such chapters were necessary, they should have been 
briefer, and left more space for the subject in hand 
— religious toleration, and the theory of church 
and state. The treatment of this subject is admir- 
able, and is a distinct contribution to the history of 
our national development. The placing of the ref- 
erences to authorities in the appendix seems to us 
an objectionable arrangement. 



Notes. 



" Twelfe Night " is now added by the Messrs. 
Crowell to their " First Folio " edition of Shakespeare, 
edited by the Misses Charlotte Porter and Helen A. 
Clarke. 

Messrs. F. M. Buckles & Co. issue " The Poems of 
Oscar Wilde " in a two- volume edition, which includes 
the original "Poems" of 1881, "Ravenna" (1887), 
" The Sphinx " (1894), " The Ballad of Reading Jail " 
(1898), besides a few hitherto uncollected pieces. 

A second edition of Mr. Lewis F. Day's " Alphabets 
Old and New " is published by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons. An introductory essay on "Art in the 
Alphabet " gives added value to the collection of speci- 
men design with which the book is mainly filled. 

In " The Golden Fleece," published by the American 
Book Co., Mr. James Baldwin has retold the story of 
Jasou and Medea and the voyage of the Argo in lan- 
guage pleasantly fitted for the comprehension of child- 
ish readers. Much practice has made Mr. Baldwin an 
adept in this sort of narration, and many a child will 
bless him for this latest of his reading-books. 

We are glad to know that the work of restoring the 
buildings of Stanford University, damaged by the re- 
cent earthquake, has progressed so satisfactorily that 
official announcement is made that the regular courses 
of instruction in all departments Mrill be resumed at the 
opening of the Fall term, August 30. This includes 
libraries, laboratories, and dormitories, as well as the 
necessary class-rooms. 

" Local Government in Counties, Towns, and Vil- 
lages," by Dr. John A. Fairlie, is a publication of the 
Century Co. in their " American State Series." The 
work is mainly descriptive of present conditions, and 
the historical discussion is reduced to a bare summary. 
Taken together with Professor Goodnow's " City Gov- 
ernment," in the same series, this book completes the 
study of our local administrative agencies. 

Mrs. Julia W. Henshaw is the author of a convenient 
manual, beautihdly illustrated, of the " Moimtain Wild- 
Flowers of America." About three hundred species are 
included, and there are no less than a himdred full- 
page plates from photographs. The field covered is not 
defined, but it includes the far North and the far West 
of both Canada and the United States. The classifica- 
tion is empirical, based upon color alone. 

Chapman and Shirley's " The Tragedie of Chabot 
Admirall of France," reprinted from the quarto of 1639, 
and edited by Mr. Ezra Lehman, is a publication of the 
University of Pennsylvania. From the same source we 
have a monograph by Mr. Chester Lloyd Jones on " The 
Consular Service of the United States : Its History and 
Activities." These, and other publications of the Uni- 
versity, are obtainable from the John C. Winston Co., 
Philadelphia. 

Two interesting annoimcements in the magazine field

more than a half-century ago, will reappear, with the 
same name, in October, We shall miss, doubtless, the 
familiar pea-green cover with luxuriant corn-blades

of making it a " picture magazine "; and fiction, while 
not a leading feature, will not be disdained. " A maga- 
zine of general interest, but of a decidedly literary 
character " is the cheering definition of the aim of its 
publishers — who are, of course, the Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons whose father conducted so worthily the 
first series of this honored and distinctively American 
periodical. With the new " Putnam's " will be incor- 
porated " The Critic," whose editor. Miss Jeannette L. 
Gilder, will retain her " Lounger " department in the 
new magazine. — It may be significant of the dubious 
fortunes of San Francisco, and of the growing impor- 
tance of its vigorous southern rival, Los Angeles, that 
the announcement of a new Pacific Coast monthly comes 
from the latter city. This is to be the " Pacific Empire 
Magazine," and its publication is to begin September 1. 
As its title might imply, it will concern itself largely 
with the industrial and commercial development of the 
great and growing southwestern region of which Los 
Angeles is perhaps now the most vital centre and expo- 
nent. But it will include intellectual as well as mate- 
rial things in its survey, and will lighten its more 
serious contents by stories and poems, and by profuse 
illustrations. Mr. Edmund Mitchell, for some years 
past the leading editorial writer on the Los Angeles 
" Times," and author of several works of fiction, etc., 
a man of large experience and scholarship, is to be the 
editor-in-chief, assisted by Mr. John S. McGroarty, also 
an experienced journalist and author of several works of 
verse and fiction. We wish success to this new venture 
in an interesting and enticing field; it will make, we 
trust, a worthy fourth in the quartette of notable Cali- 
fornia magazines, beginning with the old classic " Over- 
land " of Bret Harte, and including the beautiful but 
ill-fated " Californian " of Professor Holder, as well 
as Mr. Lummis's " Out West " sui generis and inde- 
structible.

CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS'S NEW BOOK 

The Heart 



jFrom 
Ci0t 



That Knows 

Price $1.50 
A Tale of Exquisite Imagery and Tense Dramatic Interest 

pROFESSOR ROBERTS'S latest romance deals with the strenuous and adventurous life of the sailors 
and fisher-folk of the region at the head of the Bay of Fundy. The winds and the waves and the salt 
fragrance of the sea are in its pages ; and the strength of the tides that fight the great dykes of Tantramar. 
The vehement passions of these simple people in whose hearts emotion runs riot; and their deep natures 
which partake of the richness and steadfastness characteristic of the exhanstless meadows, make it a land 
where romance walks by day. The action turns upon the mystery of the heart's wisdom in discerning truth 
and love where reason saw but deceit and betrayal. " The Heart That Kjqows " is a g^reat human story in 
which the author has employed to their uttermost his unique gifts of rich fancy and genius of expression as 
well as that craftsmanship which has had so splendid a development during the years of his successful career.

The Problem of 
Spelling Reform 

By the Rev. Professor W. W. SKEAT

"Every one interested in spelling 
reform should read this lecture."

Crown 8vo, cloth. Si. 75 net. 

From the Preface 

The plan of the book was dictated by the 
following considerations. It is notorious that 
English writers seldom look into a grammar or 
cotnposition book ; the reading of grammars is 
repellent because, being bound to be exhaustive 
on a greater or less scale, they must give much 
space to the obvious or the unnecessary ; and 
composition books are often useless because they 
enforce their warnings only by fabricated blun- 
ders against ivhich every tyro feels himself guite 
safe.

Andrews's Specimens of Discourse 

By Arthur Lynx Axdrews, Ph.D., Instructor in English in Cornell University. 289 pp. 60 cents. 
George E. Roth, Central High School, Philadelphia : " The practical nature of the book for actual classroom 
work gives it greater value than most of the present books of selections possess. The editor shows wise appre-

McMullen's Forty Lessons in Physics 

By Lyxx B. McMullex, Shortridge High School, Indianapolis. 446 pp. 81.25. 
A departure from the traditional school text-book of physics. It takes the pupil into account, recognizing his 
limitations of capacity and interest. It selects the fundamentals within his grasp, treats these fully enough to 
permit mastery, and requires him to apply his knowledge at once to everyday phenomena. It is not a cyclopsedia 
or laboratory manual, but first and last a text-book — orderly, clear, and vivid.

By Edward Fultox, Professor in the University of Illinois. 253 pp. 12mo. Ready August 30. 
A compact statement of the essentials of rhetorical theory, with abundant illustrations from good literature and 
practical exercises. The book represents the work done in rhetoric in the Freshman year at a large university.

Vols. II. and III. Earth History, xxx^-ii. + 1316 pp. {Not sold separately.) 88.00. 
This is a notable scientific work by two of the highest authorities on the subject in the United States, and yet 
written in a style so simple that it can be clearly understood by the intelligent reader who has had little previous 
training in the subject.

THE TWO LITERARY PATHS. 



Does the practice of literary art bestow upon 
the practitioner a franchise which in some meas- 
ure exempts him from upholding the conven- 
tional ethical standards? Is the writer bound 
by artistic considerations alone, or should he 
regard also the social implications of his activity? 
Is freedom, as to both choice of subject and 



treatment, so great a good in letters that it 
should be jealously guarded and boldly exercised 
by those who make the pursuit of letters the 
work of their life ? These are the questions 
raised once more by Professor A. Schinz, in an 
essay on " Literature and the Moral Code," 
which appears in the July issue of " The Inter- 
national Journal of Ethics." His purpose is to 
show that the two views here suggested " are not 
reducible to the same terms, to show why they 
are bound to clash and why there can be no 
reconciliation." The question is essentially that 
of the conflict between " art for art's sake " and 
art considered as " a means to an end." Broadly 
speaking, the former ideal is upheld by writers 
of the Latin race, while the latter is exemplified 
in English practice. 

The problem is mainly a recent one, the pro- 
duct of democracy ; for as our essayist hastens 
to indicate, the freedom of literary expression 
was not seriously challenged in behalf of society 
at large as long as education was the privilege 
of the few and literature coidd not hope to be- 
come popular in the modem sense. True its 
freedom was often challenged in the interests of 
dogma, and authority resorted to energetic meas- 
ures for the suppression of ideas that threatened 
to be subversive of the established order. But 
such tyranny was very different from that sought 
to be exercised in our own democratic age by a 
public opinion which, at the best, must be nar- 
row in its outlook, and, representing only the 
average thought of multitudes of commonplace 
minds, is little likely to be either liberal or truly 
enlightened. According to some writers, undue 
deference to this opinion is a serious menace to 
the interests of intellectual freedom, and the 
permanent interests of civilization forbid that 
it should be accorded. In the view of others, 
such deference is no more than a reasonable 
concession to conservatism, for imqualified truth 
would prove a dangerous prescription for demo- 
cracy in its present vulgarized and transitional 
stage of development. 

In his discussion of this problem. Professor 
Schinz points out that it has been solved in 
essentially different ways by Latin and by En- 
glish practice. Taking France and America

for his typical cases (and what is said of these 
two countries is fairly applicable to other com- 
mimities of the same racial charaxiter) he says 
that " in America there is held to be only one 
general public, while in France this unity does 
not exist ; there is more than one public." That 
is, the intellectual elite which created the French 
literature of the period preceding the Revolution 
has conserved its tradition ever since, refusing 
to temporize with the democratic demand for 
popular literature. To realize the truth of this 
proposition, one has only to note how the line of 
succession is continued from Voltaire and Did- 
erot and Beaumarchais, over to our own time 
through such men as Chenier, Beyle, Merimee, 
Flaubert, and Leconte de Lisle. Similarly, one 
might note the Italian series which includes 
Alfieri, Manzoni, Carducci, and eVen d'Annun- 
zio. On the other hand, in England the sur- 
render to democracy was fairly complete by the 
middle of the nineteenth century, a surrender 
which the solitary isolation of Landor strongly 
emphasizes, while America never had an aristo- 
cratic literary tradition for democracy to attack. 

The consequences of this fundamental differ- 
ence have been far-reaching. During almost 
the whole Victorian age of English literature, 
writers in general submitted to the censorship 
of the uneducated public, choosing only such 
subjects, and treating them only in such ways, 
as would prove acceptable to the masses. Who- 
ever failed to take this coiu-se paid the penalty 
of neglect or of deliberate ostracism. English 
" cant " thus became a byword in the less tram- 
melled literary circles of continental Europe, 
and particularly among the French and Italians. 
This position our essayist exposes in a striking 
passage : 

"The Anglo-Saxons, in trying to keep from the 
masses ideas which are not generally understood, admit 
the existence of a sphere of thought above the compre- 
hension of the general public. They thereby concede 
the value of an independent elite. It is remarkable that 
they pay special attention to the higher literature in 
France, and write about its papers and periodicals. But 
an unexpected result is that in this way the literature 
for the elite in France is brought before the general 
public in America — for which it was not intended and 
is not suitable. Hence the severe judgments, from a 
moral point of view, which are passed upon products of 
French literature. Such criticism would be right only 
if these works had been meant for the general public." 

When we think of aU the restrictions that the 
nineteenth century has imposed upon English 
and American literature in the name of morality, 
when we take into account the stifling atmos- 
phere in which our poets and novelists have for 



the most part been forced to do their work, we 
cannot help feeling that the French have chosen 
the better path, despite the licentious excesses 
that have marked its pursuit. For by means of 
liberty alone, even although attended by license^ 
is ethical advancement possible ; and who will 
contend that the English-speaking world has 
yet reached anything like finality in its ethical 
standards ? Neither art nor morals could boast 
of robust health in a community which coiJd 
bring forth such an abortion as Buchanan's 
despicable attack upon Rossetti, or in a com- 
munity which found it necessary to speak with 
bated breath of Hawthorne's supreme master- 
piece and look askance at its success. 

The process of recovery from this condition 
of artistic atrophy has now been well under way 
for a nimiber of years, and it is safe to predict, 
that the reign of taboo will not be reestablished 
either in England or America. It is asking too 
much of literature to demand that it seek na 
entrance into large and important areas of the 
ethical province, that it leave imtouched whole 
groups of problems which intimately concern 
social welfare. There is no aspect of life or 
thought that is privileged to evade exposition 
and analysis, even although this artistic freedom 
of choice prove harmful to the moral equilibrium 
of some weak and imstable souls. Nor may we 
hope to see restored that artificial distinction 
between elite and populace which, as we have 
seen, still to a certain extent persists in other 
countries. Even in those countries it is fast 
ceasing to exist, as the surge of democracy over- 
whelms them. Art will assert its prerogative, 
despite the fact that its freedom may prove mis- 
chievous to certain of the iminformed. And for 
a time a large section of the public will indis- 
ieriminately assign good art and bad art to the 
same category, having reference only to its choice 
of subject, and not at all to its truth of concep- 
tion and nobility of expression. This is the 
penalty that must be paid for the regime of 
suppression. A great pother is being raised even 
now about certain daring writers who have freed 
themselves from the old conventional bonds ; 
but the sole basis of the outcry is that single 
fact, whereas its proper basis shovdd be their 
shallow insincerity and the obvious fact that their 
chief stock in trade is a sort of tricky audacity. 
Condemnation on these groiuids would be legiti- 
mate; condemnation upon the score of their 
subject-matter is not. But the public, every 
section of which claims that the whole of litera- 
ture belongs to it, will be long in learning to- 
distinguish and rightly to appraise.

A DiscrPLE AXD Follower of Lamb.* 



Elusive and elf-like, often fantastical and 
whimsical, but always of a gentle and ethereal 
beauty and a radiance of his own, the late Alfred 
Ainger presented many points of similarity with 
his chosen favorite in literature, Charles Lamb. 
A quiet drollery, a way of flashing the oddest 
and most unexpected conceits, an unconquerable 
addiction to puns, a turn for neat humorous 
verse, a love of play-acting and play-actors, a per- 
ennial youthfulness of temperament, restricted 
literary likings, but the most exquisite taste 
within these limits, — such are some of the com- 
mon characteristics of the two men. Like Lamb, 
Ainger remained unmarried; like him, he un- 
complainingly assumed family cares and burdens 
that another might have shrunk from ; like him, 
he loved his friends — and they were many — 
whole-heartedly and to the end. With Horace, 
whom one so appreciative of light and graceful 
verse must have admired, he could well have 
said, — 

" Nil ego contulerim jucoado santu amico." 

But points of difference between Ainger and 
Lamb were not wanting. Lamb was no church- 
man. He lived his religion, but shrank from 
professing it. An ardent admirer of Priestley, 
he was Socinian in his theology, so far as lie was 
anything. Ainger, on the other hand, though 
the son of a Unitarian, was strictly trinitarian 
in belief, and, however far from seeking the 
"fat slumbers " of the church, was loyally true 
to the establishment whence came his bread and 
butter. Latitudinarianism repelled him, and 
with dissenters he was wholly out of sympathy. 
" A clergyman," he early wrote in his private 
notebook, "is, at the best, a man in blinkers. 
He must not receive any lateral impressions." As 
became his cloth, too, he was, with all his Ariel- 
like incorporeality, of staid and decorous mien 
— excepting always those occasions of con- 
viviality among intimates that warranted the 
indulgence in harmless mirth and frivolity. 
Carlyle would never have seen in him the " piti- 
ful, ricketty, gasping, staggering, stammering 
Tomfool " that he fancied he saw in Lamb. " La 
spite of all his fvm," we are assured, " he made a 
serious impression on his contemporaries." "A 
true man," he is pronounced by one of them, 
"who might in any circvunstances be relied on 
to do what was right, nor count the cost — a man

firm of purpose, reverent, and lovable." Let us 
view him in his bodily presentment as he is 
pictured for us, at the age of thirty, by his biog- 
rapher, Miss Edith Sichel: 

" Pale of face, pale of hair, with eyes of a piercing 
blue, varying in. intensity according to his mood, now 
cool and light, now very dark and glowing, his nnder- 
lip protruding, as if to shoot forth some whimsy, bis 
fine, nervous hands often used in an expressive gesture, 
his form, frail yet elastic, slightly stooping as it moved 
forward with a distinctive striding step — it is thus that 
he rises before us, a figure suggestive of the stage in its 
good old days, of one of the actors whom Lamb remem- 
bered, full of character and of erratic grace. His 
appearance was indicative of his character. The first 
word suggested by both was personality — that force 
which can only be felt, not defined. When he came 
into a room, the room knew it and was changed. * When 
he left us,' said a friend, ' we always felt as if we had 
been at a wedding; we did not know what to do for the 
rest of the day.' It was part of his charm that he con- 
trived to unite so many paradoxes. Mercurial and 
formal, fantastic and imbued with sharp common sense, 
he was a strange mixture of Ariel and of an eighteenth- 
century divine. Charitable he was more than most men, 
and almost as prejudiced as he was charitable; full of 
deep Christian humility, yet with such an eye for foUy 
that his tongue often dealt in mordant satire. A lover 
of the obvious, but so fastidious that he sometimes 
seemed capricious or unjust; dependent on good com- 
pany, but also a creature of moods, of formidable silences 
which none could break, till some chance word that took 
his fancy changed the weather, and the sun burst forth 
again." 

Hazlitt, whom ^liss Sichel quotes, once wrote 
of Lamb : " I will, however, admit that the said 
Elia is the worst company in the world in bad 
company, if it be granted me that in good com- 
pany he is nearly the best that can be. He is 
one of those of whom it may be said : Tell me 
your company and I'll tell you your manners. 
He is the creature of sympathy, and makes good 
whatever opinion you seem to entertain of him." 
These words are cited as " the best epitome of 
Alfred Ainger's social qualities." To supple- 
ment all this, and to show the " little canon " in 
light and sportive vein, let us quote from two of 
his letters to intimate friends. The first extract 
is from a note to Du Maurier, the second fro m 
one to a lifelong friend, Mr. Horace Smith. 

" Can you recommend any books ? . . . I have just 
reviewed for the Guardian the English translation of 
Jusserand's English Novel before Shakespeare. What 
an excellent and readable book it is. I used to say of 
another French critic — 

" Our T^gliah critics their dull wits keep strainingr. 
When — Enter Taine ! — and all is entertaining. 

" But the epigram would be far truer if it could be 
adapted to Jusserand. For a taste — 

" A Frenchman straTing into English fields 
Of letters, seldom has a locut standi. 
But if there's one to whom objection yields, 
Tis Jusserand — he has the ' ju* errandi.' 

" Send this to him with my best respects."

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



"... Do you want any papers or books to read dur- 
ing your convalescence? Let me know, and I will send 
you some. I have made no jokes lately, or I would send 
them. Though I did make a happy quotation at Marl- 
borough ! The Head Master told me that a neighboiir- 
ing gentleman, who had been touring in Switzerland, 
gave a lecture on the subject to the boys, illustrated 
with magic lantern views. ' Ah! ' I said, ' they used to 
do that in Juvenal's day, you remember — 
" '. . . I demens, curre per Alpes 
Ut pueris placeas.' 
" But the neatest thing I ever heard was said by a 
member of my cloth, Archdeacon Burney, the other 

day " 

However, not to claim too much of The Dial's 
space, and to give prospective readers of the 
book an added stimulus, we refrain from quoting 
this latter witticism — a most brilliant one — 
which may be found at page 180. 

Like Lamb (a final parallelism), Ainger 
believed in " the sanity of genius." He once 
declared in a lecture on Shakespeare : " It is 
owing to that surefooted step of his in things 
moral that he never slips, even on that most 
dangerous groimd ; that he leaves us in the end 
satisfied." Ainger has long been recognized 
as one of our best ethical critics of literature. 
Beauty, and all other excellence, with him, was 
dependent on moral health. Hence his pro- 
nounced dislike of Shelley. In literature, as 
in life, ethical and spiritual truth alone make a 
lasting appeal to man. When the dark hour 
comes, what else can sustain him? It was char- 
acteristic of Canon Ainger to discover rare ex- 
cellence in the novelist named in the following 
extract from a letter to Mr. Edmund Gosse : 

" Very many thanks for the kind thought that sent 
me Mary Wilkins. I have already read two or three 
of her sketches, and they have a rare feeling and truth 
— notably the one of the two old sisters who were 
taken away to a charitable ' home.' Perfect, it seems to 
me, is the treatment here — and of a kind beyond Mrs. 
Gaskell even." 

Sympathetic and stimulating in his criticism 
of favorite authors, Ainger recognized his limi- 
tations — limitations which he had in part fixed 
of his own deliberate choice. " In religious 
knowledge, as in all things," he once said 
" dare to be ignorant of many things, that you 
may have time and heart and brain for a few 
things." The vagueness of philosophical ab- 
straction was not attractive to him, and hence 
Emerson he found uncongenial. " How," he ex- 
claimed, " can one rise from reading Emerson's 
Conduct of Life without feeling, if he has a 
human heart within him, that if that is the whole 
Gospel of himianity, it were our blessedest fate 
to die and be at peace." 

These few notes will, it is hoped, call atten- 



tion to a book worthy of careful reading. Miss 
Sichel has given a vivid delineation of a winsome 
personality. In evident sympathy with her sub- 
ject, she writes in a way to enlist the reader's 
sympathy also. It was the gently feminine, not 
at all the rudely masciiline, that predominated 
in Ainger. Taste is the feminine of genius, as 
his well-loved Edward FitzGerald used to main- 
tain ; and in Ainger we discern a delicately 
refined taste. To a woman's pen may well fall 
the pleasant task of teUing the story of his life 
and work. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Writings of Abraham liiNCOLN.* 

In these dignified and beautiful volumes we 
have in what must be their final form the writ- 
ings of the great War President. The original 
four volumes have been expanded to twelve ; 
an expansion resulting in part from the intro- 
duction of about twenty per cent of new material, 
but mainly from the use of large type, an open 
page well margined, thick paper of the best 
quality, a himdred good illustrations, portraits, 
and facsimiles, a few usefid notes, and in each 
volume a special introduction by a writer of 
reputation, and a poem on Lincoln. The pub- 
lishers promise for the last volume a complete 
bibliography and a comprehensive index. The 
arrangement of material is chronological, as in 
the former edition, new writings being desig- 
nated by asterisks. 

Diligent search has been made, during the 
eleven years since the earlier edition was pub- 
lished, for letters and speeches that then escaped 
the notice of the editors. A considerable amount 
of new material has been found, although, as 
might be expected, there is little that is really 
significant in these additions. They are inter- 
esting as showing more completely the working 
of Lincoln's mind or the details of his life, but 
they are of minor importance in forming large 
judgments as to his character and ability. Yet 
enough that is new is brought together in this 
edition to make it necessary for every large 
library to purchase it for students of Lincoln 
and his times. And it is a beautiful memorial 
for the Lincoln enthusiast to have for his own.

ham, add to the value and interest of the work. 
In short, this " Gettysburg edition " approaches 
perfection in its completeness, dress, arrange- 
ment, and helpful apparatus. A few of the sig- 
nificant additions are: The " Rebecca Letters " 
leading up to the duel with Shields ; the Wor- 
cester speech in the Taylor campaign, and an 
important speech before the Illinois legislature 
in 1837 ; some important letters, among the 
hundreds added ; early law arguments and legal 
opinions, and many letters and telegrams that 
show Lincoln's steadily increasing grasp of the 
problems of military strategy, going far to make 
good the claim of some caref id critics that Lin- 
coln was his own best general. 

In going over these writings, one is struck 
first of all by the sudden development of Lin- 
coln's mind, as well as of his literary style, when 
his soul was set on fire by the Missouri Com- 
promise and by the bold attempt of the South 
to carry slavery into the Northern territories. 
Before that time there had been but few marks 
of greatness in his career or in his writings. 
With limited education and narrow outlook, in 
his early life he shared the prejudices and 
adopted the fallacies of his section and his time. 
While he was a good politician in the local and 
state fields, and was always fair and manly in 
political management and controversy, he was 
then simply a high-grade politician. His one 
term in Congress gave him no distinction, though 
he was not on the floor of Congress the nonentity 
that so many new Congressmen are. He made 
some good speeches, and he won attention by his 
telling political arguments, as well as by his 
humor ; but there was little that showed what 
greatness was really in him. At the close of his 
two-years term he was ready to sink into the 
obscurity of a bureau position in Washington, 
apparently feeling no stirrings of the great 
genius that was latent within him ; and when he 
failed to get that position he went quietly about 
his professional work for a few years, active 
only as a political manager of the Whig party 
in Illinois. 

But the great contest between freedom and 
slavery woke into being the real Lincoln. There 
is a remarkable contrast between his political 
speeches during his Congressional term and 
earlier, on the one side, and the Peoria speech 
of 1854 and those that followed it. Before 
1854, Lincoln is mainly the politician, a shrewd 
manager of men through his insight into their 
weaknesses, but high-minded and patriotic. His 
speeches were able and interesting, but of the 
same class as the better political speeches of our 



own day. But the attempt of the South to 
seize the new Western territory for slavery 
I stirred his soul to its very depths ; the question 
became to him fundamentally a moral one, and 
the politician was transformed into the states- 
man and the prophet. There were disclosed 
power and resources that he himself had never 
suspected ; and it was almost another Lincoln 
that instantly commanded the attention of the 
North by his complete mastery of the subject 
and by the prophetic glow with which he in- 
vested his discussion of it. 

It is this greater Lincoln that is seen in the 
larger portion of these twelve volumes. The 
Peoria speech of 1854 begins in the middle of 
the second volume, and the Lincoln-Douglas 
Debate fills the third and fourth and a part of 
the fifth. Later in the fifth volimie are given the 
speeches at Coliunbus and Cincinnati, delivered 
on successive days in September, 1859, and the 
Cooper Institute Address of February, 1860, 
with the accompanying speeches of the New 
England tour. In the sixth volimie we find his 
letter of acceptance, less than a page in length ; a 
mass of letters connected with the campaign and 
the organization of the administration ; the ad- 
dresses delivered on his journey to Washington ; 
the great First Inaugural Address ; letters, 
orders, proclamations, the message to Congress 
of Jidy 4, 1861, opening the fateful special 
session of Congress, and other papers to Sep- 
tember, 1861. 

It is an ever-new marvel how a man who 
grew up in the surroundings that were Lincoln's 
during the first twenty years of his life, in an 
illiterate commimity with few books and no out- 
side stimxdus to seek them, with no training 
except self -training and no thought of forms of 
expression except clearness, can yet have worked 
out a literary style of such perfection and beauty. 
There are passages here that have never been 
surpassed for the perfection of the thought 
expressed and of the expression as fitted to the 
thought. The writings of Lincoln may well be 
made the object of carefid study, both in college 
and imiversity, and by the intelligent citizen 
who would drink at a pure fountain of wisdom 
and patriotism. Charles H. Cooper.

A Critical, Account of American 

PAINTING.* 



Mr. Samuel Isham's " History of American 
Painting " is an interesting and invaluable 
work, although it is not a history in the scien- 
tific sense of the word as understood to-day. It 
does not deal with facts, except in a very uncer- 
tain way, and then not as a factor in the treat- 
ment of the subject under consideration. Instead, 
it is a most delightfully sane, scholarly, catholic, 
and intelligent criticism of the work of Ameri- 
can painters, and as such is entitled to the very 
first rank in the small library of true art criti- 
cism. It is a matter for congratulation to find 
that we have a man so completely equipped for 
his task as the author of this volume shows him- 
self to be. Mr. Isham was trained as a lawyer, 
which profession he abandoned for the less 
arduous if more exacting one of art, so that 
while he sees and feels and understands as an 
artist, he weighs his criticisms as a lawyer and 
writes with the terse pen of a jurist. Indeed, 
we regret that the volume is even called a his- 
tory, on its title-page ; for were it not, we would 
be relieved of the duty of saying anything but 
good of it. Limitations of space prevent" our 
noting in detail the many serious errors in dates, 
confusing misprints, and misstatements of fact, 
which the work contains, — for instance, the 
spelling of Smibert's name, and the statement 
regarding his being the earliest painter in 
America; the statement about the birthplace 
of Gilbert Stuart, and that Ralph Earl was a 
member of the Royal Academy of London, etc. 
Mr. Isham, in his Introduction, says " the 
fundamental and mastering fact about American 
painting is that it is no way native to America, 
but is European painting imported or rather 
transplanted to America and there cultivated 
and developed." How could it be otherwise, 
when we ourselves are European in everything 
from our first emigration down to the present 
time ! But he explains that " At first such art 
as the struggling colonies possessed came from 
visiting English craftsmen, usually of the most 
unskilfid type. Soon, however, they had disci- 
ples and rivals among the native born, of whom 
some of the most promising and enterprising 
went to England to perfect themselves. Two 
or three of these were men of quite unexpected 
ability. A recent critic has said that the best 
were but second-rate English painters ; but they

were second-rate only if Reynolds and Gains- 
borough be placed in a class by themselves as 
alone jirst rate^ The italics are mine, to show 
the trend of Mr. Isham's independent view of 
the American painters, an independence which 
is maintained throughout, as well when treating 
of the living as of the dead. 

Of Copley, the first American painter to do 
highly meritorious work, before coming under 
direct European influence, Mr. Isham has due 
appreciation, and analyzes his work with thor- 
oughness and justice. He gives a true estimate 
of West, placing his art exactly where it belongs 
without belittling his influence, attributing to 
him that kindliness of character which made 
him beloved by everyone who came in contact 
with him. I do not think he places Matthew 
Pratt as high as his work entitles him, and ap- 
parently he is not familiar with Peale's earlier 
portraits, which are much better than his later 
ones. It seems almost funny to hear Stuart 
generalized and damned with such faint praise 
as, " He was the best of all the earlier artists^ 
and in fact it is only within comparatively re- 
cent times that we could boast of painters in 
any way his equals "; or, " Gilbert Stuart stUl 
holds his place among our best painters^ and 
even among his great contemporaries in En- 
gland." That Mr. Isham does not mean to place 
Stuart anywhere but where alone he belongs, 
at the top, " among the few recognized masters 
of portraiture," as the " Encyclopaedia Britan- 
nica " puts it, is shown when we come to his 
serious criticism of Stuart's work. He writes : 
" What the artistic effect of his stay with West was, 
it is difficult to determine. He absolutely failed to 
acquire any of the characteristics which might naturally 
be expected. He shows no trace of West's handling, 
he got no taste for composition. In fact, it is a mys- 
tery where he gained his technique ; it bears no resem- 
blance to that of Gainsborough, Reynolds, or, least of 
all, to West. . . . His scope was limited. While they 
[English contemporaries] covered large canvases with 
full-length figures and groups, using every aid of com- 
position and costume to produce their effects, and show- 
ing the result of this practice even in the arrangement 
of their half-length portraits, Stuart painted heads, and 
little beside heads. . . . The heads are all painted in a 
cool diffused light, seldom relieved by heavy shadows, 
or dark backgrounds. There is nothing striking, nothing 
forced ; it is only a head, a head with its ordinary light- 
ing and expression. No artifice is used to throw it into 
undue prominence. Within these limitations (and they 
are serious ones) they are unsurpassed. No one of his 
contemporaries had a surer feeling for the construction 
of a head or a surer insight into character. Where he 
acquired his technique as a painter is even more mys- 
terious. It seems to have been original with him. . . . 
He paints with an imequalled purity and freshness of 
color, very delicate and sure in the half-tones, varying

his color to suit the indlTidual, hut with a pearly bright- 
ness which is characteristic. The paiat is put on thinly, 
as a rule, in short, decided touches, without heavy im- 
pasto, ' mingled and mottled,' as he himself says, and 
his execution was surprisingly sure. . . . Stuart's style 
was his own. He did not learn it from others, and 
though he gave advice freely and generously, he could 
not teach it to any successor." 

It is, of course, impossible to give Mr. Isham's 
opinions upon all the painters whose works he 
considers, and there are not many important 
names omitted ; but it seems a great mistake not 
to have given a full chapter at least to the minia- 
ture painters, who are dismissed with inadequate 
mention. Sully he commends very highly, say- 
ing that he •' stands to Stuart much as Lawrence 
stands to Reynolds "; but Neagle and Jouett 
receive only scant justice, doubtless from un- 
familiarity ^-ith their best works. His account 
of the rise of New York to its place as the 
" metropolis of the western worid," and of its 
becoming the centre of development in Amer- 
ican art, is impartial and just, ascribing this, 
very properly, to " purely commercial reasons." 
It is, however, with Chapter XII., on " Begin- 
nings of Landscape Painting," that Mr. Isham 
shows the real quality of his mind and his rare 
ability as an art critic. Speaking of Doughty 's 
pictures (page 213) as " transcripts of the na- 
ture he saw, small and unassuming, with no 
trace of foreign models, but their luminous, 
milky skies and violet distances have a peculiar 
personal charm," he says : " The real founders 
of the school (for Doughty was but a precursor) 
were Durand and Cole." Further on (p. 225), 
he writes : "* Durand's position is that of founder 
of the landscape school. Joined with him is 
Cole, who, although a younger man, preceded 
him in landscape work, for Durand was still an 
engraver when Cole came to New York ; and 
even when, ten years later, Durand turned to 
painting, he did not devote himself to landscape 
until a few years before Cole's death, and then 
ip a style and with a feeling not at all resem- 
bling that of his friend." This putting of 
Durand in his true position ahead of Cole, re- 
versing the order that has been followed gener- 
ally, is a very important stand, and emphasizes 
again IVIr. Isham's independence and discrim- 
ination. Fashion in art has no power with him. 
This is pointedly shown by his further treat- 
ment of Durand, who is not now "the fashion" 
with some of the would-be art critics. He writes 
<p. 229) : 

" Sincerity is not the greatest of the artistic virtues, 
"but no great work is without it, and it goes far to 
redeem what otherwise would be mediocre. It under- 
lies all of Durand's work, as it did Copley's, as a firm 



foundation. The portraits with which he began as 
painter are imlike any by his contemporaries. They 
suggest some of the early Dutchmen, men like Moreelse, 
in the thoroughness of their workmanship and their lack 
of display or seeking for attention. . . . Like his por- 
traits, his landscapes were his own, and not to be mis- 
taken for those of any other man. He was too good a 
craftsman to tolerate any of the slipshod work of Cole, 
— everything is finished clearly and definitely. His 
canvases have a silvery gray tone, very true to what the 
eye sees on a clear summer day after the bright light 
has dulled its sensitiveness to strong color. His wood 
interiors are naturally richer but his shadows are true to 
the local color. . . . The silvery tone must have come 
from the fact that he worked largely out of doors, not 
making studies only, but painting directly on his final 
picture, a practice exceptional at the time." 

Then, following the position he has taken, he 
makes Durand's work the canon by which to 
judge the works of his followers and successors. 

If space were unlimited, it would be delightful 
to give many extracts from this charmrag book ; 
to see Inness, Wyant, and Homer Martin, as Mr. 
Isham sees them. His conclusions (p. 265) on this 
interesting trio are, however, all that I can give. 

" With these three men the early American school 
culminates. If we insist on unprofitable comparisons 
and claim for any of our art an equality with what was 
best in Europe — a real equality, not one hedged and 
bettered up with apologetic references to the limitations 
of our position — it is these men that we must put for- 
ward, for the long period between the death of Stuart 
and the rise of the present school. The essentials of 
greatness they seem to have had, — deep feeling which 
took a pictorial form, ample knowledge, complete mas- 
tery of their material, and for each a style, personal and 
distinguished, which burst through that commonplace 
which fetters us all. The unprofitableness of com- 
parison has been admitted, yet appreciation of the stand- 
point from which they should be regarded and of the 
grounds on which supremacy b claimed for them is best 
gained if they are regarded in connection with the trio 
of gre&t Frenchmen, Corot, Rousseau and Daubigny. 
Thus it is possible in a way to get their bearings, to 
put them in proper perspective with the g^at world." 

Nothing in the volume shows Mr. Isham's 
deep artistic sense better than the pages he de- 
votes to Yedder's illustrations of the Rubaiyat ; 
his words give a deep insight into the man ; they 
may, indeed, be called his art-autobiography. 
But perhaps his finest chapter is that devoted 
to Whistler and La Farge, so incisive and broad 
is it in its differentiations and appreciations. 
To mural painting, which was practically un- 
known to our earlier artists, and is at present, 
as Mr. Isham says, "the most interesting and 
the most promising branch of our art," is de- 
voted the closing chapter of this remarkable 
treatise. In commending it, I do not mean to 
say that I agree with all of Mr. Isham's con- 
clusions, for I do not. When he says that 
Boston was the centre of the intellectual life

of the colonies, he evidently has not been a 
close student of the intellectual life of the 
middle colonies, — as Philadelphia was, until 
the first decade of the last century, the virtual 
head of the entire country, intellectually and 
politically. Or when he says that the fine Gibbs- 
Channing portrait of Washington is the best of 
those Stuart painted showing the right side of 
the face, it is clear that he does not know the 
superb original from life, now in Providence, 
R. I., which is the finest portrait painted by 
Stuart, irrespective of subject, I have ever seen. 
Or when he says Hunt " remains to the end an 
amateur, not only in the sense of loving his art 
but also in lacking the sure professional mas- 
tery "; or, at the close of his chapter devoted to 
Sargent and the American painters in London, 
where Sargent's talents are claimed to "give 
him securely his position as the first portrait 
painter since Reynolds and Gainsborough," an 
ascription rather premature and open to much 
discussion. But from what has been said it 
will be seen that this work leaves little to be 
desired in the way of healthful and sound crit- 
icism of American painting, if it does leave the 
history of American painting yet to be written.

The Oldest Text-Book of Moral- 
Philosophy.* 



The oldest text-book of Moral Philosophy is 
still on the whole the best. Aristotle's "Ethics," 
despite its systematic deduction of everything 
from principles logically coherent and inter- 
dependent, does not achieve perfect scientific or 
artistic unity. Notwithstanding its excellent 
start, it does not leave in the reader's mind the 
impression of a complete and rounded whole. 
But neither do the treatises of Spencer, Sidgwick, 
or Leslie Stephen. The systematic application 
of a single principle or method makes an im- 
pressive showing for a few introductory chap- 
ters. But the facts of man's ethical life are 
too large to be swallowed by any formula. The 
progress of science, the idea of Evolution, the 
accumulations of experience, the enlargement of 
the historical horizon, have given to our modern 
theorists some points of view which it would be 
unreasonable to expect to find in the older 
thinker. But if we could not keep both, we 
should probably lose by substituting, for edu- 
cational purposes at least, their for his concrete

treatment of any great ethical topic such as 
justice, friendship, pleasure, or happiness. He 
discusses the facts ; they are preoccupied with 
the relation of the facts to — Calvinism, it may 
be, or the behavior of the Amceba. 

The complete intelligence of Aristotle's work 
is reserved for those who have the patience to 
trace its dependence line by line upon the dia- 
logues of Plato. But that is a counsel of per- 
fection. And meanwhile the book will continue 
to be expounded by men of Aristotelian rather 
than Platonic spirit — by those, that is, who 
prefer " common sense " to genius touched with 
mysticism and aiming at edification as well as 
analysis ; by those who cherish the illusion of 
systematic method or formal completeness, and 
are repelled by Plato's apparent dramatic aban- 
donment of himself " whithersoever the argu- 
ment blows." 

This is presumably the temper of Mr. Thomas 
Marshall, the latest exponent of Aristotle's 
" Theory of Conduct." He seems to have 
studied Plato mainly in the spirit, if not ex- 
clusively in the writings, of the utilitarian and 
rationalist Grote. And his chief concern is to 
minimize, when he cannot wholly explain away, 
the sm-vivals of Platonic mysticism and absolu- 
tism in the philosopher of his preference. He 
interprets Aristotle's constant appeals to the 
quod semper., quod ubique, quod ah omnibus 
to mean that there is no standard of right con- 
duct except the normal sentiment of the society 
in which the agent happens to live. Having 
thus attributed an ethical philosophy of pure 
relativity to Aristotle, he is genuinely surprised 
and grieved to find him elsewhere maintaining 
a theory of " natural justice," and suggests that 
the " confusion twice confounded " is perhaps 
due to the blunders of the students who reported 
the master's lectures (pp. 300-302). 

Mr. Marshall's interpretation is doubtless the 
natural expression of his temperament and phi- 
losophy ; but it seems to be confirmed by a whole- 
some aversion to the sentimental Hegelizing 
Platonism of the English Universities, as exem- 
plified, for instance, in the commentary on the 
" Ethics " of Professor Stewart, and in his 
recently published " Myths of Plato." Objec- 
tive philology ought to transcend these anti- 
theses — but it never will. All men are either 
Platonists or Aristotelians in some sense, if 
not in that intended by Coleridge. Acute but 
matter-of-fact minds will continue to misappre- 
hend Plato's real meanings, because of their 
aversion to the " Plotinists "; and sentimental 
Platonists will continue to view both Plato and

Aristotle through a mystical haze of allegory in 
which neither can be distinguished from the 
other or from Dante or Hegel ! 

Apart from this general criticism, there are 
few exceptions to be taken to Mr. ^Marshall's 
book. Translations of the " Ethics " and phi- 
lological commentaries exist by the score. He 
has undertaken to present it in a " readable 
shape," by means of a free but accurate para- 
phrase accompanied by prefatory introductions 
and expository resumes for each important chap- 
ter and division of the work. There is perhaps 
some illusion in the expectation that the general 
reader will find these 578 large pages more 
readable than the 350 small pages of Welldon's 
translation. But Mr. Marshall is justified in 
the claim that he will find them more intelligi- 
ble if he really wishes to understand Aristotle's 
meaning. The quotation in the foot-notes of 
the original Greek for all crucial texts and sig- 
nificant phrases need not interfere \d\h the 
pleasure of such a reader, and adds immensely 
to the value of the book for the student — to 
whom, after all, it must make its chief appeal.

Some Modzrx Ideas rx Edttcatiox.* 



Wise advocates of the claims of the physical in 
education do not fall into the error of making the 
body all-important, but rather show that body and 
soul are so intimately linked that an education for 
spiritual ends must begin with the body, and never 
at any time ignore its interest. Such an advocate 
of the sound body is Mr. Stuart H. Rowe, whose 
" Physical Xatiu-e of the Child " is just appearing 
in its second and revised edition. The writer evi- 
dently draws upon a wide experience of the most 
enlightened investigation of the bodily welfare of 
school-children : he recognizes that no one vice or 

defect is the cause of physical evils in schools, 

for example, the favorite scapegoat of '* over-study " 
is reduced to its proper place in the ranks along 
with *'lack of proper food, outdoor air or sleep, 
baths, irregularity of habits, unhygienic conditions 
of home, school, or person," and half a dozen other 
fruitful causes of exhaustion and breakdown in 
schoolchildren (p. 71). There is no wholesale con- 
demnation of existing conditions, but many practical 
recommendations as to how we may progress from 
where we are to where we ought to be. 

As one example of the great practical importance

I of the contents of the book, we note the matter of 
I deafness. Investigation shows that at least one 
child out of four has defective hearing, usually with- 
out knowing it himself, and almost always without 
\ its being detected by either parents or teachers ; 
this sensory defect is enough to cause first the ap- 
pearanc-e, and later the actual existence of dulness, 
while in nine-tenths of the cases the whole evil 
might be averted by seating the child in a more 
favorable place, or by obtaining slight medical or 
surgical aid. Matter of no less vital importance is 
contained in nearly every chapter, and particularly 
in those upon Sight. Nervousness, Fatigue, Disease, 
and Growth and Adolescence ; this last chapter is to 
be reconunended especially to parents. 

We are surprised to find only slight mention of 
the school physician (p. 161). One of the strongest 
impressions made by the facts presented is a con- 
viction of the need of such an officer ; the plan has 
been tested by thorough experience in Europe, par- 
ticularly in Grermany, and our situation and problems 
in this respect are not widely different. The fuU 
benefit of modern knowledge concerning the relation 
of physical welfare to mental development can be 
realized only when teachers and parents are equipped 
with the intelligence available in such a book as this 
of Mr. Rowe's, and when in addition the best pro- 
fessional knowledge and skill are directed inunedi- 
ately to the problems of the school through some 
such agency as the school physician. 

The style of the work is clear and straightforward. 
There is a good index, and an excellent list of lit- 
erature for further study of the subject. We heartily 
agree with Superintendent Maxwell's praise, cited 
in the preface to the second edition, and wish that 
every teacher and parent might read the book. 

Professor O'Shea's new book, " Dynamic Factors 
in Education," is also really a treatise upon the 
physical nature of the child, in two aspects, those of 
motor activity and fatigue, which form the topics 
of the two parts. The author's aim, as stated in the 
preface, is to show " that in the early years at least, 
motor expression is essential to all learning "; and 
to discuss the nature and causes of fatigue, and its 
effects upon mind and body (p. ri.). He adds that 
he has kept especially in mind '' those who are 
charged with the immediate care and culture of the 
young, and has aimed to avoid technicalities and all 
pm-ely theoretical discussion." Now it is not given 
to many men who are occupied with advanced work, 
to be able to write successfully for the comparatively 
uninitiated ; moreover, as Professor O'Shea himself 
more than once points out, much of the matter under 
discussion is still in an unsettled condition, and 
therefore unfit for popidar presentation. The result 
is that the book seems poorly suited for the use either 
of the practical teacher, for whom it is annoimced, 
or the professional student. In spite of the author's 
resolution to the contrary, it is burdened with meth- 
ods of investigation, where results alone should be 
given. This is particularly true of Chapters XII.

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



and XIII.; a conspicuous example is the insertion 
of a half -page cut of a "tone-tester," which is 
harely mentioned in the text and contributes nothing 
to the intelligibility of the discussion. Again, the 
terminology and style are in many cases far too 
technical for the average teacher; this is most marked 
in Chapter VI., where the comparatively simple fact 
that all voluntary action grows out of random motor 
impulses is rendered difficult by technical phrase- 
ology and incompletely interpreted data. The habit 
of technical scholarship is strong upon the author, 
leading to the frequent inclusion of references and 
allusions quite unsuited to the express aim of the 
book ; such are the constant citation of original in- 
vestigators whose names must be entirely without 
interest or value to the average teacher. The larger 
number of the references in Chapter XII. are of 
this nature. 

While the book is thus of limited value for popu- 
lar use, it cannot be expected, in view of the author's 
declared purpose, to be a work for scholars. The 
summaries of data make no pretension to complete- 
ness. Much elementary matter is included, as, for 
example, the discussion of the eye in Chapter XIV., 
and of the nerve-ceU in Chapter XII. As we un- 
derstand the author's position, moreover, there is no 
intention of propounding anything new either in 
methods or results. The work is not free from 
questionable statements. We are told that " One 
knows what a thing is after he has reacted upon it, 
not before. The mission of eye and ear is to give 
us second-hand or inferential knowledge, to reinstate 
former experience " (p. 32). As a matter of fact, 
eye-and-ear knowledge are no more second-hand and 
no less " dynamic " than other knowledge ; the eye 
moves in perception with a swiftness, complexity, 
and ceaseless activity which no other sensory appa- 
ratus can equal. Again, it is said that " the aesthetic 
characteristics of things always demand relatively 
great coordination and attention to minute details " 
(p. 72). Is it not true, rather, that the aesthetic 
quality is found only in a contemplation which loses 
the details in a single unified view? On page 79, 
after pointing out, most commendably, certain limi- 
tations upon the value of manual activities, the 
author says : " A boy who is to be a carpenter should 
continue in all stages of his educational course to 
make manual training of this sort his most important 
occupation." We cannot too strongly dissent from 
this, as implying a false view of the end of educa- 
tion ; surely the boy who is to be a carpenter needs 
preeminently an intellectual and spiritual culture in 
his school-days which will save him from the greatest 
disaster that can befall him, namely, being a car- 
penter and nothing more, — neither citizen nor man, 
nor intelligent parent, nor in any sense a full human 
being. 

Dr. Seeley's little book entitled "Elementary 
Pedagogy " contains much valuable information and 
advice for young students of teaching, and will no 
doubt be of use to many of those for whom it is 



avowedly written — those who are not advanced in 
educational thought, but are attacking pedagogy for 
the first time. Dr. Seeley's ideas are always sane 
and practical, and no one need hesitate to follow 
him, always of course with intelligent choice and 
adaptation. The time is probably past, however, 
when the whole field of " pedagogy " can be dealt 
with even in the most elementary manner in a single 
volume of three or four hundred pages ; the attempt 
results inevitably in superficial treatment, omission 
of essentials, and lack of unity and coherence. The 
successive chapters are not bound to each other by 
any manifest scientific order and progress ; in some 
cases the sequence seems fortuitous — particularly 
in the case of " Elective studies," which comes be- 
tween " Who can be educated " and " The gaining 
of knowledge." Some subjects are dealt with in 
widely separated chapters : actual method in teach- 
ing, for example, is treated more or less directly in 
Chapters VII., VIIL, XIV., and XVI. Some of 
the chapter headings do not seem to fit the content 
of the chapter : under " The Process of Education " 
we really find the process of instruction; under 
" Educational Limitations," after the limitations of 
original ignorance and of dulness, we have such 
topics as " Self-employment," " Self-control," " Ad- 
vantages of superior education," — none of which 
seems to be " educational limitations." We empha- 
size these points because one of the important qual- 
ities of a book for the young student of education 
is clear logical unity and order. 

The author seems to have gone beyond the legiti- 
mate bounds of quotation. The whole book abounds 
in quoted passages, the most extreme case being 
Chapter III., where out of a total of less than thir- 
teen pages we find four of direct and three of in- 
direct quotation. It is beyond the power of any 
writer to unify a discussion consisting so largely of 
the ideas and words of others. 

We cannot help feeling that Dr. Seeley's argu- 
ment for the existence of a science of education 
really proves at most that there is scientific study 
of education, — a proposition which few would deny. 
The question whether education or pedagogy occu- 
pies a domain and deals with a subject sufficiently 
unified and coherent to form the matter of a science 
is not touched in the argument ; and this is the real 
question as to a science of education. 

Professor Thorndike is peculiarly fitted to write 
upon the subject of his recent book, " The Principles 
of Teaching." With an unusually broad knowledge 
of child-psychology, he combines a large and sane 
conception of education as a process leading from 
nature up to cultiu-e and social character. " Educa- 
tion," he says (p. 21), "should at times stimulate 
and favor inborn tendencies, at times inhibit them, 
and, most frequently of all, direct and guide them." 
On a later page (p. 39) the author again sets forth 
the just conception of the place of inborn tendency 
and activity : " Nothing really counts except as it in- 
fluences the pupil's own responses. That the teacher 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



91 



must educate pupils by means of their own activities 
does not, however, mean that what a pupU does of his 
own accord is right." And again we find a gentle 
correction of what some have heralded as the true 
" new education ": " The child who sits quietly ab- 
sorbed in solving a problem is more active and more 
truly active than his neighbor who is jumping up 
and down with glee at getting the answer "(p. 40). 

The book is just what it calls itself, and not an 
attempt to treat the principles of education; the 
author recognizes the separate functions of the 
educational statesman, as we should call him, whose 
work is to plan curricula and school systems, and 
the teacher, wliose work is to execute intelligently 
and faithfidly the plans thus made. Nevertheless, 
Professor Thorndike continues, rightly, "It is not 
wise, however, to study the Sow of teaching with- 
out any reference to the What or the Why" (-p. 2). 
The book is built in accordance with these ideas, in- 
cluding first a very brief outline of accepted ideals 
as to the end of education, then a fuller treatment 
of the basis of education in natural tendencies and 
impulses of all kinds, and of the methods of cultivat- 
ing and guiding these potentialities toward the 
desired end. 

The most striking qualities of the work are rich- 
ness of content and balance and sanity of treatment. 
The author is at once psychologist versed in the 
processes and achievements of advanced investiga- 
tion, and educator familiar with schools, teachers, 
and pupils, as they actually exist. To richness and 
balance we may add concreteness and clearness. 
The style is everywhere plain and direct, — a vital 
necessity in any work which is to have a wide use- 
fvdness. The treatment of instinct and capacities, 
on pp. 21-35, is particularly good in this respect, — 
for example : " Teaching little girls to be attentive 
to their dress and appearance is much the same as 
trying to teach an infant of six months to walk." 
And again : •* Thus, the tendency of a child to chase 
and torment a kitten may be inhibited by giving the 
child no kitten to play with, or by teaching him 
early to stroke and feed the kitten, or by beating 
him in case he does pull its tail and throw stones at 
it." The author has that knack of uniting illustra- 
tion and proof which is so great a virtue in exposi- 
tion and argimaent; thus he clinches the truth that 
interest and easiness have no necessary connection 
by the statement : " A tug of war, and putting up 
the heavy dumbbell the fiftieth time, are indefinitely 
painful, but may be very interesting" (p. 57). 

In addition to illustrative matter in the main dis- 
cussion, the author has included many pages of 
exercises, designed to stimulate and guide the stu- 
dent in fxirther reflection upon the various topics. 
Of these he says in the preface : " They aim to test 
and increase the student's knowledge of principles ; 
to insure the habit and power of application of gen- 
eral principles to the particular problems of the 
school room ; to give training in judging theories, 
methods and devices" (p. vi.). 

Where room is wanting for half the praise we 



should like to offer, it seems invidious to include 
adverse criticism, especially as we do not believe the 
book has any really dangerous faults. However, we 
may mention one or two points in which it seems to 
us to be susceptible of improvement. First, it seems 
to leave something to be desired in manifest logical 
progress and unity; it is not made clear just why 
certain topics are treated, or why they foUow in 
the given order ; we believe the right subjects have 
been chosen, and presented in the right order, but 
it would be helpful to the young student to have 
more light upon the reasons for the choice and 
arrangement. 

The treatment of Correlation (pp. 127f.) seems 
to us to stick fast in the prevalent false view that 
studies are to be hooked on to each other by some 
scheme or set of artful devices ; when the trnth is, 
rather, that all studies should grow out of a common 
root, and so need no artificial bonds. Practice is, 
however, so hopelessly in arrears at this point that 
theory may well fall into despairing silence. 

On the whole we do not know any single book 
more to be recommended for giving young teachers 
a scientific conception of their work. All teachers 
and students of education may well rejoice in its 
publication, as adding to the dignity and scholarly 
rank of the teaching profession.

Chapter* on Professor Walter Frewen Lord's 
19th century " Mirror of a Century " (John Lane 

noveiuu. Q^^ ^oeg ^j^ j^g^jf undertake to re- 

flect the hundred years recently closed, but presents a 
series of thoughtful essays on thirteen (the author says 
twelve) English novelists whose works are regarded 
as constituting a looking-glass wherein maybe viewed 
the life and aims and ideals and achievements of the 
nineteenth century in England. The novelists selected 
are, in their order, George Eliot, Mr. W. E. Norris, 
Jane Austen, the Brontgs, Thackeray, Dickens, Lord 
Lytton, the Kingsleys, Lord Beaconsfield, Anthony 
TroUope, and Charles Reade. In temperament the 
author resembles Trollope, who, he says, "had the 
settled mind (my own, so I can understand it). He 
loved things as they were; and loved to make the 
best of them." But even after this avowal of par- 
tiality for the chronicler of Barsetshire, one is 
astonished at having him called "the most popular 
novelist of the nineteenth century," — and this too 
in a volume that includes a hearty eulogy of Dickens. 
The mere record of book-sales and of republication, 
at home and abroad, tells a different story. In dis-

acter and lofty aims and noble achievements, must 
all be attacked and denounced, and until life is re-

obviously severe. In treating George Eliot, the

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



essayist says that philosophers, " who have so often 
told us all about life and man and woman and con- 
duct, have nothing in common with the [i. e. this] 
great novelist." Many other disputable assertions 
might be quoted from these chapters, which are 
probably all the more enjoyable because they arouse 
occasional dissent. They show wide reading, skill 
in interpreting and comparing, a wholesome enjoy- 
ment of what is good in fiction, and they tend to 
whet the reader's appetite for a fresh assault on last 
century's favorites in novel-writing. More than this, 
now and then a page has something of the geniality 
of the imperishable " Hours in a Library "; and what 
higher praise cotdd an essayist desire? 

In the minds of students of history, 
A genial work in j^e honored name of Mr. Thomas 
English history, tt i i • i i i . i 

Hodgkm has always been associated 

with Italy and Western Europe during the early 
Middle Ages. It is with some cm-iosity, therefore, 
that we approach a book by the same writer which 
undertakes a survey of English history from the 
earliest times to the Norman Conquest. This is the 
period which has been assigned to Mr. Hodgkin in 
the series known as "The Political History of En- 
gland," edited by Dr. Hunt and Mr. Poole. Logically, 
Mr. Hodgkin's volume constitutes the first instal- 
ment of the series, but its publication has been de- 
layed. After a brief introductory chapter upon the 
" Prehistoric Fore-world," the author develops the 
general history of Britain imder the Romans, and 
tells of the Anglo-Saxon conquest, of the conversion 
of the English, of the coming of the Danes, and of 
the invasion of William the Norman. The book 
closes with the death of Harold at Hastings, at which 
point Professor G. B. Adams, in the next volume, 
takes up the story. It is characteristic of this series 
that in it political history shall be emphasized. It 
is therefore very proper for Mr. Hodgkin to be as 
cautious as he is when speaking of social and consti- 
tutional questions, and to afford them comparatively 
little space in his text. On the other hand, his narra- 
tive of the hegemonies of the early period, his ac- 
count of the conversion of the English to Christianity, 
and his portraiture of the great men, lay and reli- 
gious, who built up the English nation, gives oppor- 
tunity for Mr. Hodgkin's delightfully happy power 
to tell a somewhat dry story in such a way as always 
to hold the reader's interest. It is in the chapters 
devoted to Roman Britain that Mr. Hodgkin is at 
his best; but it is not alone in his account of the 
Roman occupation that we appreciate the worth of 
his deep learning in the historical and archaeological 
materials of the Continent, for throughout the book 
he charms the reader with happy parallelisms be- 
tween things and events in the distant island and 
in the greater Roman world. This richness of sug- 
gestion and allusion seems to be the element of 
greatest origfinality in Mr. Hodgkin's volume, which 
is in no sense a rival of the works of Seebohm, Mait- 
land, or Vinogadoff. Well fulfilling the purpose for 
which it is intended — an account of the political 



history of the period — it presents a clear and in- 
teresting narrative, the fruit of a broad and, let us 
say, genial scholarship. 

It is to be regretted that our own 
An unhappy generation has very little opportunity 

to judge of the works of the artist 
who in the last generation worked hardest for the 
cause of high art in England. Benjamin R. Haydon 
was among the first to recognize and acclaim the 
transcendent merits of the Elgin Marbles ; he was 
ever ready to help promising students with advice 
and instruction ; he attacked the abuses of his pro- 
fession with a severity that frequently recoiled on 
his own head ; he not only advocated schools of de- 
sign but assisted in their establishment ; and through 
his lectui'es and writings he undoubtedly helped to 
raise and educate the taste of the people. Both his 
ambition and his talents turned him to historical 
painting on large canvases ; but poverty drove him 
to porti-aits as pot-boilers, and even these did not 
suffice. He was always in the grip of the money- 
lenders, was several times imprisoned for debt, and 
finally ended his own life in despair. Fortunate 
indeed is it that he could not foresee that his cheer- 
ful dreams of a future place in the National Gallery 
of London for the big pictures that had been neg- 
lected in his lifetime would fail of realization. 
Although several of his pictures have become the 
property of the nation, some have been loaned to 
provincial museums, one is in a lumber-room of the 
Victoria and Albert Museum, but not one is at 
present hung in the National Gallery. One of his 
own favorites, however, " Christ's Entry into Jeru- 
salem," found its way to America and is now in the 
cathedral at Cincinnati. But Haydon, unhappy in 
so many ways, was nevertheless fortunate in his 
domestic relations and in his group of close friends. 
Mr. Paston's book on " Haydon and his Friends " 
(Dutton) is, for all its sorrow and tragedy, bright- 
ened by the record of many joyous days and hours, 
and is altogether a fascinating biography, Among 
Haydon's intimates were Wordsworth, Keats, Charles 
Lamb, Sir Walter Scott, Sir George Beaumont, and 
Miss Mitford. Although they had never met, 
Elizabeth Barrett was his correspondent, and with 
her clear sight and passionate sympathy she seemed 
to understand him as few others could. After read- 
ing the autobiography which Haydon left behind 
unpublished, and analyzing the causes which drove 
the artist to self-destruction, she exclaimed, "Tell 
me if Laoco5n's anguish was not as an infant's sleep 
compared to this ! "

the Vanities Braiuerd s" In Vanity Fair (Moffat, 
in Paris life. Yard & Co. ) disclaims all intention of 
entering upon psychological deep seas in the discus- 
sion of the feminine side of Parisian life. The story 
of the fashionable Parisienne and her frocks, the 
author thinks, is best told by " snap-shots of the inner 
courts of Vanity Fair." The inner courts first con-

sidered are the " ateliers " from which the frocks 
emanate, and anyone interested in those sanctuaries 
will lea]*n many interesting secrets about '* Worth 
and the old masters, and Paquin and the new 
schooL" Rather shockingly interesting some of the 
facts are, to be sure, and rather depressing, when 
one comes to consider the trend of them. The 
descriptions of Parisian life — the art of dining 
" le sport," the round of social events in Paris and 
the other cities to which the Parisian toilets annu^dly 
transport themselves, — apparently prove that so- 
ciety is founded upon chiffon. The descending 
scale through which this society passes is fairly in- 
dicated by the title of the chapter on " Cannes and 
the world ; Nice and the flesh ; Monte Carlo and the 
devil." Mrs. Brainerd takes the matter seriously, 
and implies that a new philosophy of clothes should 
be written by a •' feminist of genius." The question 
seems to be whether Paris is frivolous because dress 
there is so extravagant, or whether dress is extrav- 
agant because Paris is so frivolous. None but a 
philosopher can solve so profound a problem ; but 
when the right man (or woman) comes there will 
be an American chapter in the answer, for in this 
preliminarj- volume it is written that Americans give 
the largest orders to the masters of dress, and that 
each year American women " grow more ardent in 
their worship of the Vanities." 

The advantages of ^ considerable popular as well as 
popular election historical interest is Mr. Greorge H. 
of u. s. Senator*. Hay nes's volume on "The Election of 
Senators "in the " American Public Problems " series 
(Holt). The author reviews the steps by which the 
framers of the Constitution came to adopt the present 
method of choosing Senators, discusses the early 
methods of procedure followed by the legislatures, 
analyzes the Congressional statute of 1866 which was 
designed to establish uniformity of practice through- 
out the country and which is still the law on the sub- 
ject, points out the defects of the existing method, 
traces the growth of the movement for popular election, 
reviews the argmnents for and against the proposed | 
change, and sets forth his own views in support of 
the proposition that popular election has substantial 
advantages over the existing method. In one form : 
or another, he says, the legislatures of thirty-one 
States — more than the full two-thirds prescribed '\ 
by the Constitution — have commimicated to Con- 
gress their formal approval of the proposed change, 
and the House of Representatives has passed a ; 
resolution on five different occasions proposing an 
amendment to carry out the popular demand, but 
each time the measure has been blocked by the stolid 
resistance of the Senate. Meanwhile, the legisla- 
tures in many States, through the ingenuity of 
primary election schemes, have gone far toward 
relegating the choice of Senators to the people, con- 
trary to the spirit of the Constitution. The grounds 
upon which the framers relied in support of choice 
by the legislature, as ^Ir. Haynes shows, have for 
the most part become obsolete. The decisive advan- 



tage of popular election, he thinks, would be found 
not so much in its effects upon the national govern- 
ment as upon the individual States ; by tending to 
divorce national from local politics, by promoting' 
reform in the representation of the State legislatures, 
by improving the character of the legislatures, by 
preventing serious interruption of State business, 
and by doing away with dead-locks, it would insure 
a fuller representation of the States in the Senate. 

TKe moral ^he tiUe of Mr. George W. Alger's 

overttrain in critical studies of American problems, 
btuinei, life. « The Moral Overstrain" (Hough- 
ton), is peculiarly applicable and suggestive. The 
essay which gives the book its name deals with a 
1 question ever present in the financial world — the 
overburdening of the moral strength of clerks and 
others employed on salaries remarkable for their 
meagreness, by permitting them to handle large sums 
I of money. The newspapers are fuU of the results 
I of this overtaxing of the moral nature, which, the 
I author suggests, should be as much the subject of 
1 remedial legislation as the length of a work-day or 
the safeguarding of machinery. The moral over- 
strain of the capitalist is the subje<:t of the essay on 
"Unpunished Commercial Crime," the trend of 
which is easily imagined, although the special treat- 
ment win repay careful reading. "Sensational 
; Journalism and the Law " has a distinct message 
I both for the class of newspapers referred to and to 
the courts of law to whose laxness much of their 
power for evil is indirectly due. The other essays, 
"Criminal Law Reform," "The Citizen and the 
Jury," " Some Equivocal Rights of Labor," and 
" The Literature of Exposure," are interesting and 
often stimulating. One feature of the book which 
recommends it is that in almost every case the 
lawyer-author has a remedy to suggest for the evil 
he exposes. Moral overstrain is one of the most 
prominent features of American life to-day, and 
Mr. Alger has touched many vital points of it in 

these studies. 

Moral clinic* "^ Series of articles by Mr. Lincoln 
in the politic* Steffens, which appeared in " Mc- 
oftix state*. Clure's Magazine " during the years 
1904-5, have been published in book form under 
the title "The Struggle for Self -Government " 
(McClure, Phillips & Co.) The attempt of the 
author has been to trace American political corrup- 
tion to its sources in six States, which he considers 
typical of our whole country ; and in them we see 
clearly the workings of " The System " — that 
•'■ reorganization of the political and financial powers 
of a State " from which all present evils flow. Mr. 
Steffens has a great many interesting things to tell 
us about this " system," as it influences the politics 
of Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
and New Jersey ; and the story of the struggle for 
self-government in these States is effectively and 
forcibly presented. A g^phic discussion of affairs 
so corrupt, and at the same time so vitally affecting 
all American citizens, can hardly fail to arouse a 



94 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



curiosity to know more of the true condition of 
affairs, political and financial, among even phleg- 
matic readers. It is unfortunate, however, that Mr. 
Steffens, with so commendahle a purpose, should 
pdopt in his writing a tone of arrogance and a dis- 
inclination to restraint in his use of the picturesque. 
It is difficult at times to overlook this fault, and to 
keep in mind that the author's ohject is truth rather 
than sensationalism. 

_ .. , . , Mr. Hamilton Holt has made an in- 
Hfe-stories of • ^ e 

undistinguished terestmg volume oi some essays re- 
adopted citizens, printed from "The Independent" 
under the title " The Life Stories of Undistinguished 
Americans " (James Pott & Co. ). The stories pur- 
port to be, and in most cases distinctively are, the 
histories of typical workers in various American 
vocations, at the same time being the life-stories of 
average representatives of foreign nations in Amer- 
ica. As literature, the volume has but slight value ; 
nor is this value enhanced by the fact that many of 
the stories are printed with the grammatical and 
linguistic imperfections of the writers or tellers. As 
social studies, however, many of the tales are of vital 
human interest. The naive stoiy of the Igorrote 
chief contrasts well with the tales of the old-world 
people of Greece and Syria. The lives of the Chi- 
naman, the negro peon, and the Indian are pecu- 
liarly interesting in their relation to the American 
composite. The other characters — the Lithuanian 
packer, Italian bootblack, French dressmaker, Irish 
cook, etc., — are too much with us not to be of in- 
terest. If the book succeeds in arousing in its readers 
a sense of the unity of human concerns and endeav- 
ors, it will have accomplished its purpose. 



liTOTES. 



« Trimity College, Cambridge," by Mr. W. W. Rouse 
Ball, is one of the series of " College Monographs," 
bearing the Dent-Dutton imprint. It is prettily printed 
and illustrated. 

" The Life of John William Walshe, F. S. A.," that 
extremely interesting imaginary biography by Mr. 
Montgomery Carmichael, is sent us in a new edition, 
although seemingly unchanged, by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
&Co. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. publish a reprint of 
Major Richardson's " Wacousta," a historical romance 
of Pontiac's conspiracy, first published in 1832 in Lon- 
don. A portrait of the author is given, and other 
illustrations. 

" Our Common Wild Flowers of Springtime and 
Autumn," by Miss Alice M. Dowd, is a descriptive 
manual, without illustrations excepting a frontispiece, 
published by Mr. Richard G. Badger. One himdred 
species or groups are included. 

Mr. John Foreman's exhaustive work on " The Phil- 
ippine Islands," which has proved such a mine of infor- 
mation and instruction ever since this country has labored 
under the incubus of its oriental possessions, is now 
republished (and imported by the Messrs. Scribner) in 
third edition, revised and considerably enlarged. 



" The Social Ideals of Alfred Tennyson as Related 
to his Time," is a book by Dr. William Clark Gordon, 
published at the University of Chicago Press. Origi- 
nally a doctoral thesis, the work is now presented to 
the non-academic public as a contribution to popular 
sociology. It is a painstaking production, provided with 
many extracts and many more references. 

A Life of Oscar Wilde, by Mr. R. H. Sherard, is 
announced for immediate publication by Mr. Mitchell 
Kennerley of New York. It is promised that this volume 
will give the true facts of Wilde's career as a writer, 
his biography, and an account of his literary work in 
the many fields in which' he so greatly distinguished 
himself. It will contain some interesting illustrations 
and facsimile documents. 

Dr. Edward Preissig's " Notes on the History and Po- 
litical Institutions of the Old World " (Putnam) is a con- 
venient students' manual of general history from the 
earliest times to the end of the nineteenth century. No 
claim is made by the author to originality; in fact, the 
work is based, he says, largely on Myers's histories and 
Wilson's book on " The State." Owing to the wide field 
covered, the work is of necessity little more than an 
epitome. A distinctive feature is the parallel treatment 
of the course of history in each nation, with the develop- 
ment of its political institutions, particular attention 
being given to origins. 

A book that should be found very useful by advanced 
students in high schools is " A Handbook of Literary 
Criticism," by Mr. William Henry Sheran, published by 
Messrs. Hinds, Noble & Eldredge. After an introduc- 
tory section upon the general principles of literary art, 
the analysis of its various forms is systematically taken 
up. In each case, both precept and example contribute 
to the treatment, so that, for example, the student of 
the epic first has its nature and structure explained to 
liim, and then proceeds to special studies of Homer, 
Virgil, Dante, and Milton imder the guidance of well- 
known critics. There is a great deal of matter in this 
book, and we can recommend it to both students and 
teachers. 

" The Oxford Anthology of English Literature," by 
G. E. and W. H. Hadow, will be issued by the Oxford 
University Press in three voliunes. The object of the 
work is to indicate the chief landmarks in the progress 
of English literature. Hie first volume traces the course 
of prose and poetry (other than dramatic) from Beowulf 
to the writers of the Jacobean age; the second volume 
will follow the history of the English drama to the same 
terminal limit; and the third volume will take up the 
record at the time of Milton and will continue it to that 
of Tennyson and Browning. For each volimie, char- 
acteristic examples have been selected, with such brief 
introductions, critical, explanatory, or biographical, as 
the subject seems to require. The first volume will be 
ready this month. 

An edition of Hugo's " Hernani," edited by Professor 
James D. Brmier, and provided with an important 
introduction, is published by the American Book Co. 
From the Messrs. Heath we have French texts as fol- 
lows: Jules Moinaux's comedy "Les Deux Sourds," 
edited by Mr. I. H. B. Spiers; "First Year of French 
for Young Beginners," by Mr. J. E. Mansion; and an 
abridgment (to about half size) of Taine's " L'Ancien 
Regime," made and annotated by Professor W. F. Giese. 
An " Introduction to Scientific German," in the form of 
eight lectures on experimental chemistry by Dr. Rein- 
hart Blackmaim, is edited by Dr. F. W. Meisnest, and

published by Messrs. Henry Hplt & Co. From the 
American Book Co. we have also an edition of Schiller's 
" Wilhelm TeU," edited by Professor E. C. Roedder, 
and two of Theodor Storm's tales — " Im Sonnenschein " 
and " Ein Griines Blatt " — edited by Professor G. L. 
S^-iggett. 

Mr. Haldane Macfall's book on Sir Henry Irving 
(John W. Luce & Co.) is an appreciative, rather than a 
critical, review of the late tragedian. It is divided into 
three parts, — "The Man," "His Career," and "His 
Art." The first part pictures Irving's physical char- 
acteristics and mental attributes, and throws interesting 
side-lights on his character; the second foUows his career 
from the time of his birth, in the Somersetshire village, 
on February 6, 1838, up to the time of his death, Octo- 
ber 13, 1905, tracing his life during the early stock- 
company days, and through his last American tour, the 
year of his death. The third portion consists of a dis- 
sertation upon art, and upon the art of Sir Henry Irving 
in particular. Though a trifle laudatory, Mr. Macfall 
has produced a lucid portrait of his subject. The book 
is illustrated by ^Ir. Gordon Craig.

TWO SPLENDID NOVELS 

The Awakening of Helena Richie 

By MARGARET DELAND 
Author of "Old Chester Tales," "Dr. Lavendar's People." 

"A perfect book," declares the New York Times. "Everybody is reading The 
Awakening of Helena Richie now. It is the novel of the Summer." 

" As an achievement in letters this story of passion and folly, repentance and renun- 
(aation, deserves to be ranked among the chiefest samples of American imaginary 
writing." — Philadelphia North American. 

"Such work as this is bound to endure, must endure," says the Providence Journal. 
It shows how good American fiction can be. The story charms insistently from the 
first page, but presently it flashes out into a tremendous drama, catching the reader 
in its onward sweep and holding him enthralled to the end. 

Illustrations by WALTER APPLETON CLARK. Price, $LSO. 



Buchanan's Wife 

By JUSTUS MILES FORMAN 

Author of "Tommy Carteret," "The Island of Enchantment." 

The heroine is a beautiful girl forced by her family to marry for money. Her 
husband, Buchanan, shortly disappears, and a year later a body is found that Beatrix 
allows to be identified as that of Buchanan, her husband. Her marriage with her 
early lover follows. 

A startling turn takes place and a strange series of events begins. The story 
remains poised over a situation dramatic and unique until the thrilling climax comes 
with a rush of surprise. A more dramatic story, with the outcome of a woman's 
fight for love held in breathless suspense, it would be difficult to imagine.

LIST OF NEW BOOKS 122 



THU EDICT OF OYSTER BAY. 



The amusing antics of tlie spelling reformers 
have sporadically occupied the attention of the 
public for a good many years, but there has been 
no particular reason to take them seriously. 
They were displayed by a coterie of zealots, and 
although they found an occasional imitator whose 
defection from the cause of good taste was a 



matter for regret, it was fairly evident that the 
walls of conservatism had not suffered a serious 
breach. But Mr. Carnegie's mischievous sub- 
sidy of the movement considerably changed the 
situation, since money will gain adherents for 
the most pernicious sort of propaganda, and now 
that the President of the United States has given 
his official sanction to the assault upon ortho- 
graphy, it is time to sit up and take notice. Cer- 
tainly, no one who resents this ill-considered 
meddling — this attempted use of a monkey- 
wrench upon the delicate mechanism of a watch 
— can be justified in holding his peace. 

It is unfortunate that money shovdd be put 
to such uses as this ; it is also unfortunate that 
the word of an individual, because he happens 
to hold exalted public office, should for that 
reason alone (sinc« no other is in this case think- 
able) exert a widespread influence. But these 
facts, however unfortvmate, must be reckoned 
with, and we apprehend no little harm from the 
recent edict of Oyster Bay. The mere fact that 
the President's messages will hereafter be 
couched in mutilated English does not in itself 
count for much, for frequent and voluminous as 
those messages are, they will be chiefly circulated 
through the agency of newspapers that will spell 
them in orthodox fashion. Kor do we antici- 
pate any headlong rush on the part of publishers 
to adopt the new spellings, for to do so would 
rather seriously jeopardize their practical inter- 
ests. A few — a very few — among respectable 
periodicals have for several years been printing 
such weird symbols as " thru " and " program " 
and "catalog," but they have not been flattered 
by imitation, and have only succeeded in mak- 
ing themselves rather ridiculous. 

The chief practical menace of this new official 
pronouncement is directed toward our public 
school systems. These are often under the con- 
trol of men who are only too prone to favor any 
change that is tagged as a reform, and who are 
only too often incapable of understanding that 
this particidar " reform " has any other aspect 
than that of a time-saver. The mischief that 
coidd be done by a city board of school trustees, 
or even by a single school superintendent, is 
enormous, and we counsel the friends of English

of their children, lest these be made the inno-

cent victims of a policy of false educational 
economy. The impetus given by the recent 
presidential ukase to this demoralizing move- 
ment will be at once felt at many points, and 
some of them will be those points of least resist- 
ance that in any such case yield to comparatively 
slight pressure. Now is the time for defenders 
of standard English to be everywhere on the 
alert, for, lacking due vigilance, some of their 
strategic positions will surely be lost by default. 

There is little use in presenting again the 
old array of arguments for and against spelling 
reform. The only plea that is or can be urged 
in its behalf is the narrow utilitarian plea of 
an economy of time — for children learning the 
use of their mother-tongue and for foreigners 
making their acquaintance with English. There 
are so many causes of waste in our elementary 
education that this particular economy is sug- 
gestive of saving at the spigot while the bung- 
hole remains wide open. Besides, the economy 
is largely illusory. A child learns spelling either 
by visualization of the word-symbol as a whole, 
or by an arbitrary memorizing of the literal 
series. He does not learn to spell by the appli- 
cation of phonetic rules. We have in mind a 
high-school girl who the other day was asked 
to write the sentence : " My uncle sprained his 
ankle." She wrote it as follows : " My unckel 
sprained his ankle." She was the perfect type 
of the constitutionally bad speller, and the most 
logical system of orthography imaginable would 
not help her case. 

Having made the most of their plea for time- 
saving, the spelling reformers devote the rest of 
their energy to a series of disingenuous attempts 
to weaken the considerations urged against their 
hobby. For example, they discover that some 
erratic writer of the past occasionally used a cer- 
tain spelling which happens to fit in with their 
notions, and present this sporadic instance as a 
sufficient warrant for our setting estabKshed cus- 
tom at defiance. Or they parade a few stock 
words, such as " island " and " rhyme," which 
happen to be misleading as regards their origin, 
and then triumphantly declare the entire argu- 
ment from etymology to be overthrown. To 
such childish tactics are the reformers reduced 
in their effort to make a display of logic, and 
to make the worse appear the better reason. 

But argument upon any subject is futile un- 
less based upon some sort of agreement concern- 
ing the meaning of terms and the desirability 
of ideals. The case against arbitrary spelling 
reform is emphatically a case in which a com- 
mon imderstanding between conservatives and 



radicals is impossible. They do not speak the 
same tongue. How can a man to whom words 
are mere counters, having no more character 
than Arabic numerals, enter into the feelings of 
a man to whom they are aesthetic and emotional 
symbols, having physiognomy and life, conse- 
crated by associations, and appealing in covmt- 
less subtle and undefinable ways to faculties 
deeper than the logical intelligence ? Let us 
take an example, the first that occurs to us, 
the words of Kent at the moment of Lear's 
supreme agony. 

"Vex not his gost: O, let him pass: he hates him 

That would upon the rack of this tuf world 

Stretch him out longer." 

To the spelling reformer, our resentment at this 
desecration is nothing more than a display of 
unreasoning prejudice in behalf of an artificial 
convention. How much deeper the feeling really 
is we shall not attempt to explain, for he would 
not understand our language. 

The particular list of three hundred " sin^- 
plified spellings " which are hereafter to grace 
the literature that proceeds from the White 
House doubtless represents, in the eyes of the 
reformers, a very moderate step toward the 
realization of their dull pedantic ideal. They 
have enough of the wisdom of the serpent to 
know that the dear public must be led by de- 
grees to take their medicine, and that the dose 
must be well sugared by sophistry and smooth 
palaver. But they make it quite evident that 
the bottle is capacious, and may be trusted in 
the future to provide longer and more nauseous 
draughts. Hamlet's words are clearly to the 
point : " Thus bad begins and worse remains be- 
hind." Since aprinciple is at stake, and not a few 
forms of special usage, the list in question need 
not be examined in much detail, although cer- 
tain features may be worth a brief consideration. 

A large proportion of the recommended 
spellings give the forms now generally accepted 
in this country. To some of these, such as 
" judgment," " license," " synonym," and " anti- 
toxin," there is no serious objection. Of others, 
such as the words terminating in " or," " ize," 
and " er," it must be said that American ad- 
herence to these forms has become so general 
that there is little use in trying to escape them. 
The preterite terminations in " t " must be held 
objectionable, although they have a legitimate 
use in poetry, where they help to a more imme- 
diate consciousness of the rhyme. The termi- 
nation " gram," while perfectly proper in such 
trisyllabic words as " epigram " and " mono- 
gram," becomes highly mischievous in " pro-

gramme," for the simple reason that for most 
people it at once changes the word to " program," 
transforming a mouth-filling spondee into an 
insignificant trochee. As for the terminations 
in " log," they are utterly abominable. This 
miserable truncation may satisfy the ear, but to 
the eye, looking for the equivalent of the Greek 
logos, it is an impardonable offence. Some- 
tlung similar must be said of the terminations 
in " gog." To sacrifice the good old English 
guttural in such words as " though," " thorough," 
and "through" is asking too much of our lin- 
guistic conscience, and we must reject the atro- 
cious "thru " for the additional reason that it 
does not spell " through," even phonetically. 
The distinction between the vowel sounds " u" 
and " ou " is evident to any delicate ear, but the 
spelling reformers do not care much for delicate 
susceptibilities of any sort. Nor can we be 
reconciled to the suppression of the diphthong 
" ae " in such words as " aesthetic " and " arch- 
aeology." On the other hand, the chemists are 
welcome to their " glycerin " and " gelatin," and 
they may even have their " stdfate " and " sul- 
fur " if they will put them^lves under bonds 
to keep the latter spelling out of literature, for 
we shall still insist upon writing 

" A fiery Deluge, fed 
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd."

Let us not forget, in our zeal for progress, 
that England is still the mother-coiintry of our 
speech, that sacred heritage which it is our solemn 
duty to transmit to our descendants in unim- 
paired richness of expressive quality. Let us 
remember also that to teach our children an 
orthography that is likely, in the slightest degree, 
to make difficult their access to English books, 
would be a grave dereliction from our duty 
toward them. The doctrine of the spelling re- 
formers wUl never be acceptable to the cultivated 
English intelligence, and the attempt to ignore 
this fact, to create a distinctive American form 
of our common speech at the cost of an estrange- 
ment from the major part of our common litera- 
ture, argues something dangerously close to 
depravity. Rather shoidd it be our aim to do 
everything possible for the preservation of the 
threatened solidarity of intellectual interests 
among all the English-speaking peoples, to make 
concessions, even if they seem made to irrational 
prejudice, and to hold fast to the determination 
that no clique of doctrinaires shall be permitted 
to weaken our sense of the historical develop- 
ment of our language or of the unity of ova

The CUL.T OF the Cha-Jent.* 



Few things about which everyone has heard 
are so little understood as the cha-no-yu, or tea 
ceremonies practised by the Japanese. The out- 
ward forms have been described often enough. 
Foreign sojourners in Japan have even taken 
courses of instruction in making tea according 
to the prescribed ritual. " Most interesting," 
is the usual comment of those who have thus 
endeavored to acquire the novel accomplishment. 
" A curious custom," sagely remarks the ordi- 
nary observer. " Childish " is the scoffing verdict 
uttered by the superior person, who sees in it 
unmistakable evidence of littleness of mind, and 
rests secure in the consciousness of being above 
such petty t rifling . Some, even, of those who 
shoidd know better are wont to disclaim against 
what they characterize as "the perverted aestheti- 
cism of the cha-jin." 

It is this aestheticism that furnishes the ma- 
terial for the charming group of essays Mr. 
Okakura Kakuzo has put forth under the cap- 
tion of " The Book of Tea." To some extent 
the title is misleading, for it suggests a treatise 
upon tea culture, the various kinds of leaf and 
their preparation for market, when in fact it is 
a searching inquiry into the nature of art ap- 
preciation. Some other designation, as, let us 
say, " Teaism, the Religion of ^stheticism," or 
"Tlie Philosophy of Cha-no-jTi," would seem 
better adapted to bring the book to the atten- 
tion of those to whom more especially it is ad- 
dressed. Yet who can tell ? It is not a book 
of the hour, but one which, if the fair flowers 
of literature stood less chance of being choked 
out by weeds, should find an ever widening cir- 
cle of appreciative readers. So, let it be hoped, 
one name may prove as fit as another. 

To all but the initiated, the char-no-yu cere- 
mony has been overlaid with a veil of mystery. 
It is related of Rikiu, the greatest of the tea 
masters, that in answer to one who would pene- 
trate this ved, he said : " There is no particular 
secret in the ceremony save in making tea agree- 
able to the palate, in piling charcoal on the 
hibachi so as to make a good hre for boiling 
water, in arranging flowers in a vase in a natural 
way, and in making things appear cool in sum- 
mer and warm in winter." " Who on earth 
does not know how to do that? " replied the in- 
quirer. " Well," was Rikiu's happy retort, "if

you know it, do it." In one of his poems he 
asserts that Cha-no-yu means no more than to 
boil water, make tea, and drink it properly. As 
used by him there is a world of meaning in that 
last word. The truth is, the tea ceremony was 
contrived to bring together men whose art ap- 
preciation had reached the stage of connoisseur- 
ship, and to bar out those not fitted to associate 
with them on terms of intellectual equality, not, 
however, in a spirit of snobbishness, but because 
of the futility of scattering pearls where Circe's 
herd may come. 

The standard of taste set up by the cult is 
most exacting. Its cardinal principles are sim- 
plicity and purity. Restraint is its watchword, 
— ultra refinement its goal. Excess in any 
direction is foreign to its spirit. As practised 
by the gentle Rikiu it became a protest against 
extravagance whether in art or in living. Dis- 
carding highly decorated utensils, florid paint- 
ings, and apparel of bright hue, he preached, 
less by precept than by example, the gospel of 
a return to the simplicity of primitive conditions. 
If the heart and soul of the user were pure, the 
commonest bowl from the kitchen would serve. 
In this doctrine lies the secret of the cha-jin's 
preference for such things as the rude pottery 
of antiquity, and the masterpieces which, under 
the semblance of rudeness, in reality attain the 
ultimate possibilities of the potter's art. The 
preference for paintings done in Chinese ink 
with a few strokes of the brush, as compared 
with more elaborate productions in which color 
is used, goes further back and finds its root in 
the abstract philosophy of the Zen sect of Bud- 
dhists. But underlying everything is keen de- 
light in the beautiful and thorough appreciation 
of artistic quality. The few brush strokes must 
be done with consummate skill. Boldness and 
strength must be combined with exquisite ten- 
derness and softness ; each stroke must be f idl 
of life, — firm, graceful, and with the utmost 
nicety expressive of the painter's thought. 
Works of art of every description, architecture, 
sculpture, landscape gardening, the arrangement 
of flowers, poetical composition, even conduct, 
must stand the test of the application of these 
and cognate ideas to pass muster beneath the 
critical scrutiny of the tea-man. 

Mr. Okakura's essays are conceived and 
carried out in the true spirit of the cha-jin. So 
light is his touch, so exact his choice of words, 
so concise his expression, so xmobtrusive his 
statements, that one hardly realizes, at first 
reading, the breadth of scholarship that forms 
the background of his work. There is the same 



facility in the use of English that distinguishes 
his previous books. Felicities of phrase meet 
the eye on every page. Occasionally, but only 
occasionally, is there a tendency shown to indulge 
in epigram for its own sake. And once the 
omission of the definite article comes near mak- 
ing nonsense of a clever comparison. These 
lapses may be taken as necessary to make the 
book conform to the Taoist and Zen conception 
of perfection, which, as our author tells us, 
" laid more stress upon the process through 
which perfection was sought than upon perfec- 
tion itself." An unfortunate misprint on page 
42, by which the name of the Shogun Ashikaga- 
Yoshimasa is metamorphosed into Ashikaga- 
Voshinasa, can hardly be explained upon the 
same theory, and should be corrected in future 
editions. 

The message of the book is an uplifting one, 
much needed in this twentieth century world, 
dominated as it is by sordid ideals and in dan- 
ger of being engulfed in the quicksands of 
vulgar materialism. Few of us there are who 
would not be better for accepting Mr. Okakura's 
invitation : " Meanwhile let us have a sip of tea. 
The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, 
the fountains are bubbling with delight, the 
soughing of the pines is heard in our kettle. 
Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the 
beautiful foolishness of things."

Ix THE Realm of the Subconscioits.* 

Despite the general intellectual complacency 
of the present generation, there seems to be little 
reason to question that, like our forbears, we 
display the defects of our qualities. For a ma- 
terialistic folk we are interested beyond doubt in 
an unprecedentedly wide range of things spiritual 
and mental, but we are on the whole surprisingly 
insensitive to the requirements of exactitude in 
our forages after knowledge into the realms 
where information about these matters is to be 
sought. We crave insight into the mysteries of 
heaven above and earth below, yet we are prone 
to confuse theory with fact and desire with re- 
ality at the behest of any puff of popidar preju- 
dice or any gust of sentiment. In short, we 
exhibit the psychological paradox of a sincere 
and vital concern for the deep and baffling prob- 
lems of life combined with a vigorous indisposi- 
tion to face the rigors of the discipline and

training necessary to attain our ostensible goal. 
Nowhere is this tendency more vividly expressed 
than in the current interest in the subconscious. 

Contemporary occultism, which in one or an- 
other form flourishes like the green bay tree 
among us, has taken the subconscious into its 
most intimate bosom. Telepathy, mind-reading, 
veridical and prophetic visions are one and all 
explained by reference to this subterranean 
region in which are wrought out, according to 
this sect, the varied marvels for which the upper 
plateaus of mental life afford no explanatory 
clue. Even orthodox religious thought has 
shown a kindly disposition toward the possibil- 
ities of the new applicant for favor. Much of 
the miraculous in experience and scripture can 
seemingly be given a rational setting, if we are 
at liberty to accept certain of the prevalent 
teachings about the subconscious. Even in the 
more pretentious undertakings of philosophy 
and psychology the subconscious has from time 
to time receive! a dignified and cordial welcome. 
In its less worthy expressions this tendency has 
appeared in the form of a fondness for raw hy- 
potheses and un verifiable amateur speculations. 
Professor James has tellingly characterized cer- 
tain of its manifestations as the " tumbling 
ground for whimsies " of every sort. 

In view of the extant situation it is certain 
that Professor Jastrow's latest book will meet 
with a warm and weU-deserved welcome. The 
author is thoroughly posted on the details of 
the subject with which he deals, he has the scien- 
tific temperament and sound scientific training, 
added to which he writes in a smooth and finished 
style which renders his text as agreeable to read 
as it is easy to foUow. For the psychologist the 
main value of the work will be in the compendi- 
ous account which it furnishes of a large and 
significant group of related phenomena and its 
able exposition of a definite and frank attitude 
toward these phenomena. This attitude may be 
designated as that of impersonal empirical sci- 
ence. Professor Jastrow, differing in this par- 
ticular from most of his predecessors in this field, 
has no ulterior interests to subserve by the 
establishment of his own view concerning the 
subconscious. On the contrary, he leaves to 
their fate any secondary inferences and implica- 
tions which may be found to flow from the con- 
clusions he reaches. For the la}*man, on the 
other hand, and especially for the layman pre- 
disposed toward occultism, the book should prove 
a most illuminating and sobering influence. It 
sets forth in a thoroughly intelligible manner 
ihe essential facts bearing on the issues at stake, 



and builds on the exposition thus accomplished 
a sane and conservative interpretation. 

It wiQ perhaps clarify further discussion if 
we say at once that Professor Jastrow adopts a 
view of the nature of the subconscious which is 
much less radical than that commonly urged by 
its popular expounders. There are, to be sure, 
several theories in vogue at present, and all in 
more or less good repute, psychologically speak- 
ing. There is, in the first place, the theory of 
the subliminal seK, which has enlisted under its 
banners not a few of the most acute investiga- 
tors of these regions. In the creed of this theory 
the conscious waking mind with which we get 
along for the most part in the world of every- 
day life is only a portion of our total psychic 
endowment. In addition to this we have another 
and in many particulars much more interesting 
self which comes to light only in moments of a 
peculiarly propitious kind, when all the auspices 
are favorable. These are the moments of in- 
spiration, of clairvoyant trance, and similar 
sublimated experiences. These are the circum- 
stances under which real genius expresses itself, 
thereby revealing the puerile limitations which 
characterize the accomplishments of the rank 
and file of ordinary mental performances. 

Another and opposite view maintains that all 
the alleged phenomena for which there is to be 
found warrant of a reasonably scientifio kind 
are to be explained on the ground of cerebral 
action following the general laws of neural 
habit. This is in substance the old-fashioned 
" unconscious cerebration " pruned of certain of 
the mystical implications of that doctrine. This 
theory is espoused by a few of the careful stu- 
dents of the subconscious, and is probably ihe 
conviction of the majority of psychologists who 
have given no extended study to the phenomena 
in question. It represents the attitude of ultra- 
scientific conservatism. 

Professor Jastrow's view, while distinctly dis- 
claiming sympathy with the customary formu- 
lations of the subliminal self theory, and 
inclining definitely toward the alternative view 
above designated, nevertheless presents the sit- 
uation with a slightly different emphasis, and 
begets in his readers a different mood, if not a 
different conviction, as regards the subconscious. 
At all events, this has been his effect upon the 
reviewer. He marshals in a telling array all 
the facts which portray the background phe- 
nomena of consciousness as contributing essen- 
tially to the efficacy of the operations of the 
central portions occupying the foreground. The 
vague sensations of our total organism, which 



108 



THE DIAL

constitute so large and ordinarily so unsuspected 
a part of our sense of personality, our inherited 
automatic and reflex acts, which only now and 
then intrude upon our notice, our acquired 
habits, which become all but unconscious when- 
ever they approach perfection, the astonishing 
disclosures of logical and intellectually adequate 
achievements (e. g., the subconscious perform- 
ances of mathematical prodigies) which now and 
again burst out unexpectedly upon us, indicating 
that somewhere other than in our usual con- 
sciousness operations of a coherent kind have 
been in progress — these and dozens of other 
similar illustrations are ranged side by side to 
exhibit both the degree to which our introspec- 
tively verifiable mental activities are supple- 
mented by others of a kind not fairly to be 
called conscious, and the manner in which the 
former shade off imperceptibly into the latter. 
It is thus the Junctional continuity of the con- 
scious and the subconscious upon which Pro- 
fessor Jastrow chiefly dwells. If it be added 
that the author asserts that in his judgment all 
mental processes of every kind are accompanied 
by neural processes, the general temper of his 
attitude will perhaps be sufficiently clear. 

The plan upon which the volume is organized 
is simple and natural. An opening series of 
chapters describes certain of the principles of 
normal psychology which are most pertinent to 
the understanding of the operations of the sub- 
conscious. This is followed by a group of 
chapters upon the abnormal variants of conscious 
process in so far as these are relevant to the 
main subject of the book and in so far as they 
fall short of actual insanity. The final portion 
of the book is devoted to an exposition of the 
theoretical deductions which the author advances 
on the basis of the preceding parts of his work. 

In the early chapters the reader is introduced 
to an account of the function of consciousness 
and the peculiarities of attention and volition 
which follows closely the orthodox contemporary 
view. On this foundation the author proceeds 
to exhibit the play of subconscious factors in 
common everyday affairs. In connection with 
his sketch of abnormal processes, dream phe- 
nomena are subjected to an effective analysis 
which leads up to a description of the dissoci- 
ated consciousness of which psychologists have 
heard so much in recent years. This is the form 
of experience which furnishes the most substan- 
tial support for the theory of the subliminal 
self with its corruscation of related doctrines. 
As has already been mentioned. Professor Jas- 
trow does not regard the facts as justifying the 



belief in a secondary personality in any basic 
way severed from the self of the familiar sort. 
His general conception of the status and nature 
of the subconscious was described in an earlier 
paragraph. 

It is not feasible within the limits of a brief 
notice such as this to convey any satisfactory 
impression of the wealth of illustrative material 
which the author has gathered, partly from clas- 
sical sources, partly from records and observa- 
tions of his own. Suffice it to say that every 
position of consequence adopted in the book is 
buttressed by formidable arrays of illustrative 
facts. 

The defenders of the subliminal self are sure 
to maintain that their doctrine is given an un- 
duly cavalier dismissal, and were it the author's 
purpose to present the controversial aspects of 
his subject this contention could no doubt be 
upheld. On the merits of the issue it is to be 
observed that everyone is agreed that under 
certain conditions a measure of disintegration or 
dissociation occurs in the fabric of personality 
as this is revealed in memory, in temperament, 
and character. When these rifts become suffi- 
ciently deep and permanent, one group of ob- 
servers maintains that the dissevered members 
are essentially two — or more — personalities, 
and should be so designated. The other party 
to the controversy insists that the schism is never 
complete enough to warrant the postulation of 
an entirely distinct personality. 

Professor Jastrow's attack upon the strong- 
hold of the subliminal self is from the flank 
rather than from in front. He does not contend 
that the facts are incapable of interpretation in 
the manner of the theory at stake. He simply 
points out that the hypothesis is not the simplest 
one adequate to the facts, and that it consequently 
flouts the scientific law of parsimony in expla- 
nation. Moreover, he insists that the general 
implications of the doctrine considered from the 
standpoints of biological evolution and of logical 
coherency with itself are full of contradictions 
and confusions. The reviewer cannot exhibit 
the details of the case, but it appeals to him as 
distinctly worth while to call attention to the 
existence of expert opinion inhospitable to the 
subliminal seK, so widely has this doctrine in 
one form or another possessed the popular im- 
agination. 

In conclusion it may be said, as indicative of 
the perplexities which surround the author of a 
book such as this, that one of the chief virtues 
of the accomplishment from the point of view 
of the general reader is likely to be felt as a

shortcoming from the side of the psychological 
specialist. Professor Jastrow has a genius for 
metaphor, and he has allowed it full play 
throughout the whole of his text. The result 
is that his pages are always picturesque and in- 
teresting, but the psychologist sometimes wishes 
he would speak the language more technically, 
so that it might be less doubtful at crucial 
points just what he intends. This will perhaps 
be fairly regarded as carping. But a little less 
yielding to the passion for apt figure would have 
resulted in considerable condensation without 
detracting seriously from the value of the ex- 
position. Nevertheless, we must be sincerely 
grateful for an admirable achievement in a field 
calling loudly for such a piece of work.

PRESIDEXT DLA.Z: MAKER OF MODERK 

Mexico.* 



Among the names of great men of the present 
age that of General Porfirio Diaz looms large. 
On the first of December, 1904, he took the 
oath of office as President of Mexico for the 
seventh time, and began a presidential term to 
which he had been popularly elected for six 
years. Reaching the chief magistracy of his 
country by means of a successful revolution in 
1876, he has since (with the exception of four 
years, 1880-84) held the office by repeated 
elections thereto. His greatness consists, how- 
ever, not in his being a little more successful 
and longer-lived than other Spanish- American 
dictators, but in the success that has crowned 
his efforts to regenerate his country. During 
the twenty-five years of his occupancy of the 
presidential chair he has wielded a power as ab- 
solute as that of any European monarch, yet he 
has used that power for the good of the land — 
for the establishment of a benevolent paternal- 
ism ; and has possessed the love and affection 
of his subjects to an extent perhaps beyond any 
ruler in history. He has meanwhile lived the 
life of an unostentatious private gentleman in 
his capital, attending to his official duties much 
as a business man or banker in a large city 
would attend to his. He has succeeded in re- 
moving Mexico from the category of revolution- 
ary Spanish- American states to a respectable 
place among the nations of the earth. He has 
succeeded in instituting therein a form of gov- 
ernment, perhaps constitutional and Republican

in name only, and dictatorial in fact, yet thor- 
oughly adapted to the needs of the people and 
capable of establishing peace in a hitherto dis- 
tracted country. By clear-headed statesmanship 
he has lifted the country from seemingly hope- 
less bankruptcy and restored its credit. He has 
developed its resources, carried to a successful 
conclusion some of the most gigantic schemes 
for public improvements, and has established 
systems of public instruction surpassed nowhere 
dse in the world. 

Here, then, is a worthy subject for the bio- 
grapher. It is true that recent books upon 
Mexican subjects pay their meed of praise to the 
wonderful man who has brought order out of 
chaos in the neighboring republic ; and the popu- 
lar magazines give occasional notices of the work 
he is doing. Perhaps the biographer is waiting 
for the completion of his career when his life 
can be viewed in its proper perspective, the per- 
manence of his institutions tested, and the 
question answered whether the benevolent pater- 
nalism he has substituted for a former military 
absolutism can survive him. But although Diaz 
is six years past his three score and ten, he 
exhibits no decay of powers, and the world may 
have to wait many years to view his career in 
its completeness. 

No one could attain to a position of such 
unique character as that of Porfirio Diaz in any 
Spanish- American country (in Mexico perhaps 
least of all) without a career of more than ordi- 
nary interest. The bare official record of the 
military and other public services of Diaz, fur- 
nished by the Under Secretary of Naval and 
Military Affairs, covers seven octavo pages and 
exhibits him as peculiarly a man of action. Mrs. 
Alec-Tweedie has written several books of sight- 
seeing in strange lands, and her desire to find 
a subject for another volume first turned her 
attention to Mexico. Six months in that country 
in 1900 resulted m " Mexico as I Saw It," a 
book which won the admiration of the President 
because of the good it foimd in Mexico to ex- 
ploit. Four years later Mrs. Alec-Tweedie was 
invited to revisit Mexico as the guest of the 
President, and then received his consent to write 
his biography. Her time was well spent in col- 
lecting the materials for this task, in which she 
was assisted by the President and his accom- 
plished wife. The President placed his private 
journals at her command, and thus gave her the 
very best opportunity that could be had for 
writing an account of his military career. She 
was given access to official reports which ex- 
plained many of his public acts. Her intimacy

with the President and his charming wife enabled 
her to write intelligently of the private life of 
the President, and to describe his activity in the 
discharge of official and semi-official duties. All 
of these valuable materials were taken back to 
the author's London home, and there the book 
was written early in the following year. 

It is impossible to appreciate the life of Por- 
firio Diaz without knowing something, indeed 
without knowing a great deal, of the history of 
Mexico and comparing its past conditions with 
the present. Mrs. Alec-Tweedie has been able 
to draw upon the observations made with her 
former book in view, to supply this needed set- 
ting for the biography. It may be that her book 
is overloaded with matters somewhat indirectly 
related to her subject, but that can be accounted 
no fault. The numerous illustrations also are 
not in every case strictly relevant to the text. 
But all add to the richness of the book, which 
rises to the distinction of being the first adequate 
biography of the greatest man Mexico has 
produced. Arthur Howard Noll. 



The Gkeek World uni>eb Roman Sway.* 



How many of us found our early travels in 
Greek history abruptly terminated with the death 
of Alexander the Great, as if the route were sud- 
denly broken by some unbridgable chasm or 
unscalable cliff ! It is true that we heard of vague 
and shadowy creatures, known as diadochi, some- 
where over the cliff, and in our Latin work we 
read the alliterative line recording the fact that 
captured Greece took captive her savage con- 
queror ; but that Greek history really continued, 
that Greek people went on existing otherwise 
than as entities to be governed, we were never 
encouraged to realize. From one point of view 
there was a justification for the sudden and arbi- 
trary interruption, inasmuch as the great world- 
message of Hellenism found early utterance, and 
the post- Alexandrian period served mankind not 
so much by evolving a new message as by trans- 
mitting the old. Plutarch in his Pythian treatise 
contrasts the majesty and glory of that oracle 
when it swayed the decisions of nations by its po- 
etic vaticinations with its degradation in his own 
day when it talked in vulgar prose and was con- 
sulted about cattle and drains ; and this may be 
taken to symbolize the general change in Hellas, 
which in its golden age had generated those " im-

perial spirits who rule the present from the past," 
and in the Roman age was producing, in its best 
influences, a cosmopolitan humanitarianism and 
genial refinement, in its worst, political servility 
and intellectual stagnation. The great Greek 
seal on what this world of thought inherits is the 
seal of the earlier generations. 

And yet Greece between the death of Alex- 
ander and the Roman conquest is worth knowing, 
as is also the Greek world under Roman sway. 
We have the after-history of the Macedonian 
empire, which may be said to have contributed 
to the history of modern government the impe- 
rial or monarchic system, which was passed on 
to sequent centuries by the Roman Empire, — 
a contribution of tremendous moment, if not of 
unmixed benefit. Then in the Roman period 
we have an exceptional opportunity to observe 
the interaction of a subjugated nation with supe- 
rior intellectual endowments and a conquering 
nation with more effective political instincts and 
organization. Again, we must not forget that 
these centuries transmitted from the previous 
age the glorious heritage of thought and culture 
of which we have spoken, and it is worth while 
knowing the people to whom fate intrusted this 
precious charge. Occasionally, too, the fire 
flickers up from the ashes on the olden altars 
and there appears a writer, a sculptor, or a coin- 
engraver in whom we discover the glow, albeit 
an after-glow, of the marvellous Hellenic genius, 
— such, for instance, as appears in the work of 
the king of biographers. Furthermore, there is 
the thought that we are dealing with the gen- 
tile soil on which the seeds of Christianity fell 
to rise in triumphant growth and overspread 
the world ; and countless blunders of the most 
fundamental sort would have been avoided in 
the writing of European history, as well as in the 
making thereof, if more had been known about 
the seed-time of Christianity. Overlying all 
else is the fact that here we have a troubled age 
so like our own that the modern reader will 
sometimes wonder whether he is not dealing with 
to-day in the thin disguise of a Graeco-Roman 
yesterday. 

The great initial factor in the political rela- 
tions of Rome and conquered Greece is that 
Greece needed a ruler, but that Rome had not 
been trained to rule. One moment the sym- 
pathetic student of the earlier decades of our 
period is fiercely aroused by the incapacity, 
or worse, of a Roman governor, the next, he 
is brought back to a pitiful sobriety by the 
greater incapacity of the Greeks to rule them- 
selves. The city of the Tiber had arrived at its

proud position as mistress of the Mediterranean 
world rather by muddling through her prob- 
lems of growth than by pursuing a broad-based 
deliberate policy of intelligent expansion. Ac- 
cordingly it was natural enough that her first 
years in Greece should be replete with regret- 
table errors or even deplorable crimes. Right- 
eous rule, after all, seems to be almost as largely 
a matter of habit as is efficient rule, and other 
nations than Rome have shown slowness in ac- 
quiring the habit. Howbeit, even these early 
years of misrule were better than anarchy, a 
fact that one must keep constantly in mind in 
weighing such a caption as " The Roman Con- 
quest a Disaster to Hellenism." Then with the 
imperial system of provincial government came 
a fimdamental improvement, when the great ^aa; 
Romana made the world orderly if not progres- 
sive, and prosperous if not happy. It is easy 
to talk about " the political boa-constrictor " 
and its strangling embrace ; but the decadence 
of Greek cidture had begun two centuries before 
the Roman conquest threw its coils about the 
Hellenic world. It can scarcely be questioned 
that Hellenism both survived longer and exer- 
cised a wider influence as a result of the Roman 
dominion. While Roman Hellenism was not 
Periclean Hellenism, it was at any rate Hellen- 
ism as opposed to barbarism, and the world would 
have been poorer had Greece been left to its de- 
clining fate. 

For this work of rescue Greece offered requital 
in strange coin, and Rome became Greek. With 
this phase of the question, however, everybody 
is familiar. We have all read of the influence 
of Greek cooks and Greek scvdptors, Greek 
valets and Greek tutors, Greek actors and Greek 
architects, Greek vice and Greek philosophy, 
Greek drinking and Greek literature ; nor does 
this jumble of words represent imf airly the 
irregular but all-pervading sweep of the Hel- 
lenic reaction. Rome was to transmit her own 
wonderful achievement in law and political or- 
ganization ; but on the remainder of her glorious 
bequest is the stamp of another genius. 

Geographically this Greek world had grown 
to remarkable bounds. Bactria and India saw 
Hellenistic kingdoms fall after an ephemeral 
existence ; but an unmistakable imprint was 
left on the coins, the plays, and the architecture 
of these lands. Down in the Libyan desert, 
here and there, were colonies of soldiers, whose 
wives in many instances came from the old Greek 
home, whose children were taught by the old 
methods and read the old literature. In Syria, 
too, and Palestine there were flourishing Hel- 



lenic polities, and over in the Crimea were 
isolated settlements keeping alive the torch of 
Hellenism to throw at least a tiny beam on the 
darkness of surrounding barbarism. And so 
we might wander about in Greek company 
almost anywhere between the Pillars of Her- 
cides and the fabled ramparts of farther India : 
Greece had been transformed from a place into 
a civilization. 

This civilization was represented by people 
who were living and thinking, even if their 
thoughts were not original, nor their life replete 
with the highest activities. For the public life 
we may repeat our author's quotation from 
Plutarch : " For see, if we eniunerate the great- 
est blessings which polities enjoy — peace, lib- 
erty, material prosperity, populousness, harmony 
— as far as peace is concerned, the communities 
have nothing to desire from their politicians, 
every Greek, every barbarian, war has departed 
from us and vanished ; as regards liberty, they 
have as much as the rulers accord to such com- 
munities, and perhaps as much as is good for 
them." For private life there is no safe and 
convenient sxmimary, save that it was a restlesa 
age when men looked forward with uncertainty 
and backward with regret. That it was a period 
of great viciousness would be an unfair deduc- 
tion, although the deduction is drawn by one 
learned German historian ; it is much more pro- 
bable that there was a premium on the average 
decent man who was courteous to his neighbors 
and in general steered rather closely to the mean. 
While the circle of activities was not large, the 
activities themselves were not necessarily ignoble. 
There was much more education, much more 
reading, more interest in sculpture, more literary 
chat and other recreations of a refined sort than 
one commonly associates with the life of the 
period. Furthermore, there was not a little pro- 
ductivity in literatiire and plastic art, even if 
there was a dearth of greatness in these fields ; 
but we may not allow ourselves to follow this 
tempting vista. We must add, however, that 
the old religion had lost much of its vitality in 
the development of a spirit of toleration and 
eclecticism ; these cosmopolites had begun to 
feel that a new religion might be after all an 
old friend in a new guise, or even a new friend 
more valuable than the old. As a matter of fact, 
in the general restlessness many new religions 
were being welcomed with open hands. In the 
first century before the Christian era, and par- 
ticularly in the century immediately sequent, 
Isis and Mithra were worshipped to an extent 
only revealed by recent studies, and with rites

and ceremonies so strikingly akin to many fea^ 
tures of Christian usage that no reader can 
escape the significance of the similarity. In 
connection with other systems of religion or phil- 
osophy a mystic asceticism had already invaded 
many parts of this troubled world. These and 
other allied symptoms make it perfectly clear 
that we have reached the period when the field 
was ready for the seed of some great religion 
which should combine mysticism and ethical 
doctrine, which should give the world " morality 
suffused with emotion." Here, then, we have 
the fulness of time for Christianity, and our 
period shades off into other phases of the pro- 
gress of mankind. 

Since the appearance of Droysen's " Ges- 
chichte des Hellenismus," in 1836, there has 
been no lack of German publications on post- 
classical Greece ; but readable works in English 
have not been numerous. Accordingly Pro- 
fessor Mahaffy has performed during the last 
thirty years a real service, which the English- 
reading public has been glad to acknowledge. 
Nor has his helpfulness been in any way lim- 
ited to popularizing the result of German or 
other investigation, for he has been a pains- 
taking searcher as well as a ready interpreter. 
His " Greek Life and Thought from Alexander 
to the Roman Conquest " appeared in 1877, to 
be followed thirteen years later by his " Greek 
World under Roman Sway." The " Silver Age 
of the Greek World " is intended to replace the 
latter work, now out of print, " in a maturer 
and better form with much new material super- 
added." Professor Mahaffy 's books are always 
agreeable reading, — " easy and pleasant " is the 
phrase that presents itself immediately to one's 
pen, — and from their perusal much instruction 
is to be gained as well as much information. 
His well-known fondness for drawing parallels 
between the period under treatment and our own 
day never loses its attractiveness, nor indeed its 
usefidness, — jpace the school which denies the 
existence of analogies in history, — and only the 
length of this notice enables us to refrain from 
quotation. One might enumerate many other 
merits ; but it may be more usef id to touch upon 
a few groimds for difference. Surely the old 
name, which is placed at the head of this 
review, should have been retained for the new 
edition, inasmuch as it was accurately descrip- 
tive, whereas most of us think of the Silver Age 
of the Greek World as falling decidedly earlier. 
The expectations aroused by the preface are 
rather satisfactorily met, although we shoidd 
have welcomed more new material. For in- 



stance, a brief chapter on art, including the 
lesser arts such as coin-engraving and gem- 
cutting, might well have been included. Even 
if no new chapters had been added, there should 
have been inserted about three good maps. 
Furthermore, an air of finality in statement does 
not always carry finality of conviction, and this 
latter finality we not infrequently miss, as we 
also miss a comprehensively unifying exposition 
that should set the whole period before the 
reader with the compelling hand of a great mas 
ter. One may admit the difficulties appurtenant 
to the nature of the subject and still demand a 
more satisfactory treatment. Any discussion of 
differences about particular minor conclusions 
we must forego, and, in any case, such differ- 
ences are as often an indication of an author's 
soundness as of his error. We have said that 
Professor Mahaffy is an eager and earnest 
scholar and a charming writer, and that his 
works are well worth reading ; but we cannot 
escape the thought that in the present instance 
a good book might have been better. However, 
" The Silver Age of the Greek World " has come 
from the author's hand when his advanced age 
is crowded with honors, and will doubtless hold 
its place with British and American readers 
through many years. 

Such a prediction does not imply that a new 
treatment by Professor Mahaffy or some other 
historian will not be needed in the near future, 
for discoveries throwing light on our period are 
following one another in thick succession. In- 
deed, there is probably no other segment of Greek 
history for which research will do so much, 
and it is pleasing to know that the research 
is being prosecuted most zealously. Buried 
remains of public and private buildings on the 
sites of centres of population, ruins of villas in 
the rural parts, inscriptions, coins, even mummy 
wrappings and heaps of discarded papers, are 
contributing to the thrills of the excavator and 
the subsequent solid knowledge of the student. 

Mr. Punch speaks somewhere of " a nice fat 
book, tastefully presented," and we should like 
to borrow the phrase. Four hundred and eighty- 
two rather thick pages imply the fatness, and 
the remainder of the description is equally perti- 
nent. The plain brown cover, bearing a beauti- 
fid head of Alexander with the horn of Ammon, 
induces a favorable attitude before one opens 
the book. Inside, one finds an easily legible 
type and the signs of good workmanship, al- 
though in too many instances the proofreader's 
eye has failed him. An index of twenty-two 
pages, trustworthy as far as tested, adds materi-

ally to the usefulness of the work. Taking it 
all in all, we may say that the publishers have 
given the public a book of real value as to mat- 
ter without neglecting the form.

Recext Fictiox. 



Some twelve years after the date of its original 
publication, we now have a translation of Herr 
Sudermann's "Es War." The English version, 
which is carelessly made, is the work of Miss 
Beatrice Marshall, and " The Undying Past " is 
substituted for the grim brevity of the Grerman 
title. This novel is probably the best that the author 
has written, and is possibly ( unless we except " JOrn 
Uhl " ) the strongest work that German fiction has 
produced since the two great masterpieces of the 
veteran Paul Heyse. It is a work which, in con- 
struction, characterization, and deep ethical interest, 
is nothing less than masterly ; it holds the attention 
by strictly legitimate means, and leaves us with the 
feeling that we have been brought into close relations 
with a group of real men and women, sinning and 
suffering in accordance with the sternest verities of 
human existence. The scene of the story is East 
Prussia — that region of belated feudalism — and 
the setting is agricultural. Two landed proprietors 
have grown up from childhood with the love of 
David and Jonathan. Leo is a magnificent speci- 
men of physical manhood, with rich vitality and 
uncontrolled passions. Ulrich is frail of constitution, 
keeping alive by sheer force of will, and embodying 
the loftiest idealism in thought and action. Leo, 
having been detected in an intrigue with the wife 
of a nobleman of the neighborhood, is challenged by 
the injured husband to a duel, slays his opponent, 
is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and, after 
his release, goes to South America for a period of

years. Ulrich, in the meanwhile, knowing nothing 
of his friend's guilty relations with the widow of the 
slain, offers himself to her in marriage, and is 
accepted. They have been united for some time 
when Leo returns to his home, and at this point the 
story opens, for all that we have thus far related 
transpires gradually as we pursue the fortunes of 
the two friends. Here, then, is the situation. Leo 
is all the time conscious of the dark shadow of guilt 
that separates him from Ulrich. The latter, wholly 
unsuspecting, seeks to reknit the old relations, yet 
must defer to the stubborn fact that his wife had 
been made a widow by the deed of his friend. And 
now for a word about the woman, Felicitas, as the 
author has ironically named her. She is a beauti- 
ful animal, made dangerously seductive by the pos- 
session of a high degree of intelligence, essentially 
selfish and shallow, yet capable of feigning the 
utmost humility and the deepest emotion. Her old 
passion for her husband's friend is revived upon his 
return, and he, while vainly believing himself to be 
forever freed from its bondage, finds himself slowly 
yielding to the subtle influences with which she in- 
vests his life. The substance of the book is the 
struggle between these two charaeters — her strug- 
gle to bring him back into the old sinful relation, 
his to banish her from his thought, and purify his 
soul by repentance and expiation. The issue comes 
near to being a tragical one in the sense of the 
theatre ; in the psychological sense it is tragical 
throughout the course of the narrative. It is morally 
refreshing to find the problem of sin and its atone- 
ment handled in this virile fashion. For once we 
have a book in which sin is envisaged in aU its hide- 
ousness, and not glossed over with sentimentalisms 
about the weakness of poor human nature, or even 
made alluring of aspect, as is frequently the modem 
novelist's fashion. We have not often had read to 
us a sterner lesson of the way in which our sins 
pursue us, of how retributive justice abates to the 
sinner no jot of the suffering that the moral order 
of the world decrees for him. Here is a book which 
makes our admired English and American novelists 
of the day (with two or three exceptions) seem no 
more than artificers of puppets, pulling their strings 
for our entertainment. It is a tonic book, calculated 
to impress uncomfortably the easy-going conscious- 
ness, yet a work of such varied interest and artistic 
skill that it can hardly fail to attract a host of 
readers. 

Whenever a new translation of a novel by Sefiora 
Baz^n is published, someone seems to find it neces- 
sary to introduce the author in terms that would 
make of her one of the greatest of modem writers. 
In the case of " The Mystery of the Lost Dauphin," 
for example, we are bidden to think of her as supe- 
rior to George Eliot and comparable with Tourgu^ 
nieff. This is all very unfortunate, and does much 
injustice to an estimable writer whose fluent and 
industrious literary activity deserves a reasonable 
meed of praise, but not such eulogiums as these. A 
more possible comparison would be with George

Sand, although the Spanish woman could not fairly 
be accorded more than a fractional measure of the 
distinction achieved by that prototype. This par- 
ticular version of the imagined history of the Dau- 
phin has a romantic atmosphere of hopeless unreality, 
and arouses only a languid sort of interest. The 
German watch-maker Naundorff is the particular 
pretender whose claims are here espoused — whether 
with real or only assumed seriousness we are unable 
tp say. He figures as a person of incredible suffer- 
ings and superhuman magnanimity, and the history 
of his fortunes fairly reeks with sentimentalism. 
The love interest is provided by his daughter (the 
image of Marie Antoinette) and a young French 
noble who woos her before he knows anything of 
her exalted lineage. 

" Bembo : A Tale of Italy " is the legend upon 
the title-page. To be more specific, we wUl say that 
the tale is of Galeazzo Maria Sf orza, tyrant of MUan, 
who met a just death at the hands of three assassins 
the morning after Christmas, 1476. In its essence as 
a work of art, however, the tale is purely imaginative, 
for its central figure is a creature of the author's 
own fancy, projected upon the background of renais- 
sance splendor and corruption. This figure is of a 
saintly chUd, a spiritual being all song and religious 
rapture, who journeys to the court of Milan charged 
with a self-imposed mission to preach the gospel of 
sweetness and light and love. Every student of 
renaissance history knows that the period was one 
of strange contradictions, of sensibility and bestiality 
conjoined, of mysticism and materialism, of indul- 
gence in the most violent passions and devotion to 
the most exalted ideals. It is, then, only one con- 
tradiction the more to find the child-rhapsodist of 
our author's creation taken to the heart of the court 
which he comes to chide, and made the tyrant's own 
confidant and minister. Under this gentle influence, 
saintliness becomes the fashion, and the most besotted 
lives exhibit tokens of grace. This condition of 
things does not last, of course, and the end is tragedy 
— not merely the righteous tragedy of the despot's 
taking-off, but the well-nigh intolerable tragedy of 
the child's starvation in a dungeon. Mr. Capes has 
produced in this moving and opulent work something 
that comes near to being a masterpiece. He has 
entered into the inmost spirit of the age, embodied 
its form and pressure in firmly-moulded types, and 
robed them in a garb of richly-embroidered diction. 
His style recalls, now that of Browning, now that of 
Sir George Meredith, yet we should be less than fair 
in describing it as imitative of anybody. And what 
a pleasure it is to come upon a new work of fiction 
that has style of any sort ! 

To turn from this creation to Mr. McCarthy's 
mechanical fabrication, "The Flower of France," 
is to make a descent indeed. It is melancholy to 
contrast this version of the story of the Maid of 
Orleans with what might have been wrought out of 
the same theme by the author of " Bembo." We 
need not waste much time upon a production that 
exhibits such appalling vulgarisms as "won out" 



and " downed all opposition," and is cheaply senti- 
mental or sensational from first to last. Mr. Mc- 
Carthy bases his narrative chiefly upon Dom 
Gregory's supposed paraphrase of Alain Chartier's 
lost rhyming chronicle, and makes Lahire, next to 
the Maid herself, the most conspicuous figure in the 
romance. 

A clever woman who uses her talent perversely is 
about what we have learned to think of the writer 
who calls herself " Frank Danby." Her new novel 
is entitled " The Sphinx's Lawyer," and from its 
dedication to one who " hates and loathes " both 
book and subject, we are led to anticipate no very 
agreeable offering in the pages that follow. Not to 
put too fine a point upon the matter, the writer has 
sought, in the name of sentimentalism, which she 
prefers to call pity, to glorify the character of the 
late Oscar Wilde. This she attempts in a curiously 
original manner. In the book he is named Algernon 
Hazeltine, but appears only as a memory. His life 
has ended in disgrace long before the novel begins, 
but a widow has been invented for him (the 
" Sphinx" of the title), and a little coterie of de- 
voted friends who hold his memory sacred. Among 
these friends is the hero (if we may so style so sorry 
a specimen of humanity) of the present narrative, 
a lawyer by profession and a degenerate by nature. 
During the course of the novel, he is to a certain 
extent redeemed by the love of the pure and beau- 
tiful woman who becomes his wife, which seems to 
suggest as a moral the notion that no man can be 
quite hopelessly depraved. One does not often, 
even in the modern novel, find himself in company 
quite as disagreeable as that with which this book 
is peopled. 

Another novel of almost equally unpleasant char- 
acter is Miss Edith Rickert's "Folly." Thus 
appropriately named is the heroine, a woman who 
abandons her husband to spend with a lover of for- 
mer days the last months of his plague-stricken life. 
The lover is a poet, whereas the husband is only a 
country squire of stolid respectability, which we 
presume the writer holds a sufficient artistic justi- 
fication for the conduct of her heroine. So we are 
whisked away from Surrey to the obscure Spanish 
town where the poet has hidden himself in his mortal 
agony. After his death, Folly tries to patch up her 
shattered life by engaging in philanthropic activities, 
and in the end becomes reconciled to her deserted 
husband, who receives her with no word of reproach. 
This is one of those books that deliberately enlist 
our sympathies on the side of wrong-doing, yet 
maintain throughout a hypocritical pose in defence 
of morality, which assume that any aberration may 
be justified by passion and assured of a comfortable 
forgiveness after all is said and done. 

In "The Sin of George Warrener" Miss Van 
Vorst depicts for us with remorseless truthfulness 
a type of woman who certainly exists, although for 
the honor of her sex we may hope that she is not of 
frequent occurrence. She is the woman of absolute 
selfishness, unconscious in her depravity because she

has no standards of thought or conduct, caring only 
for the tawdrj' aspects of life, who finally drags her- 
self and her husband into the abyss of misery. In 
other words, the story is the old pitiful one of a poor 
woman's effort to ape the ways of the wealthy, and 
of the sacrifices (merging into crime) made by her 
husband for the furtherance of her ignoble ambition. 
It is a hateful theme, and no touch of its sordidness 
and vulgarity has been spared us by the writer. 
This unflinching realism, combined with a certain 
forcefulness of presentation, impels a reluctant sort 
of admiration f»r the book, despite a diction that is 
slovenly to the point of exasperation. 

By way of evidence that women's novels are not 
always disagreeable, we have Mrs. Hutchins Hap- 
good's " The Eternal Spring." Turning to this book 
from the three just described is like escaping from 
the malaria-laden atmosphere of a swamp to the pure 
air of the uplands. Barry Carleton, having forsaken 
that " aggregation of about two million more or less 
interesting and lawless citizens " which is Chioago, 
goes to Italy for a period of relief from the nerve- 
racking life that he has been living. He seeks an 
old friend in a Florentine villa, a widow whom he 
had once loved and for whom he fancies himself to 
retain the old feeling, and receives a warm welcome. 
But the fancied love is soon replaced by a real one, 
for among the guests at the villa is a young woman 
who looks " exactly like a Lippo Lippi Madonna." 
Lest the romantic consummation should be too 
quickly reached, the author casts a shadow over this 
joung woman's life — the terror of a possible hered- 
itarj- taint — for she has been brought up to believe 
that her father had died insane. As a matter of 
fact, he had died as the result of a duel in defence 
of his outraged honor, and the pleasant invention of 
insanity had been devised by the selfish widow as a 
means of protecting her own reputation. When this 
is made clear to the heroine, the scruples that have 
halted her decision disappear, and she yields to 
Carleton's solicitations. The story is told with fresh- 
ness and charm, in parts almost with distinction. 
The parts of the simple plot are nicely adjusted, and 
there is an effective dramatic climax in the scene 
that forces from the reluctant mother the unpala- 
table truth. 

Helena Richie was a woman who claimed the 
right to happiness without taking account of the 
social cost. Selfish, not in the narrow sense, but in 
the broad sense which may be so plausibly defended, 
she had not learned the lesson that no one may live 
for himself alone without working mischief to society, 
and that personal happiness is too dearly bought at 
the cost of those principles of conduct upon which 
social welfare depends. Her awakening was to a 
realization of the implications of her self-regarding 
conduct, and to a sense of her guilt, with the conse- 
quence that her steps were at last directed to the 
stony path of penitence and renunciation. It is a 
story as old as Christian civilization (and older), but 
it needs often to be told anew, and more than ever 
in such an age as ours, marked by moral flabbiness, 



and dangerously inclined to urge excuses for what- 
ever the individual finds it pleasant to do. It is a 
story that has seldom been told as appealingly and 
with such conscience-searching effect as in "The 
Awakening of Helena Richie," Mrs. Deland's latest 
and best novel. The scene is Old Chester, in which 
retreat Mrs. Richie lives a secluded life, believed to 
be a widow. In point of fact, her husband is not 
dead, although he has been drinking himself into the 
grave for a dozen or more years. Moreover, the re- 
puted brother who makes her occasional visits is not 
her brother at all, but an old-time lover. The chief 
agency in her awakening is an orphan boy of Old 
Chester, whom she takes into her charge, and to 
whom she becomes passionately devoted. The 
awakening proceeds still further when she hears 
of the death of her dissolute husband, and discovers 
that her lover is disinclined to fulfil his old pledge of 
marriage, now that a legal union is made possible. 
The final stage of the awakening comes when her 
history is disclosed to the village clergyman and 
physician, and with the disclosure the startling 
knowledge that they no longer consider her a fit 
peison to have charge of the child. The pathos of 
the situation is now strained almost to the point of 
becoming intolerable, but her contrition is so genuine 
that she is at last permitted to take the child with 
her when she leaves Old Chester to seek a new home. 
This is the bare outline of a very beautiful and im- 
pressive story, made out of comparatively simple 
materials, but having in it the essence of spirituid 
tragedy. The child, with his quaint conceits and 
theological conundrums, is simply adorable, and the 
book exhibits no greater triimaph than that of his 
delineation. The depiction of the recalcitrant lover, 
also, is altogether admirable for its truth to life and 
its justice to his character. The clergyman, and the 
physician, too, are delightfully human and genuine. 
As for the erratic youth who takes his own life when 
he tiiscovers that his idol is of clay, we feel that he 
is a comparative failure, artistically speaking; he 
arouses so little of our sympathy that his demise is 
hardly a cause for regret. 

Another woman's novel, far above the average of 
excellence, a leisurely story written with singular 
nobility of temper and inspired by a very fine ideal 
of conduct, is " The Invisible Bond," by Miss Kin- 
kead. It is a story of the Kentucky which the writer 
knows so well, of the society whose traditions of 
gentle breeding and honorable obligation have been 
her birthright. It is essentially the old story of a 
man and two women, the wrong woman whom he 
marries, and the right woman who is the true com- 
panion of his soul. But the situation involves us in 
no sophistical paltering with right. The man accept* 
the consequences of his mistake, not indeed without 
a struggle, for he is a human being, but with the 
conviction that the moral law is inexorable in its 
demand for the sacrifice of individual happiness. In 
the end, the death of the woman who has wronged 
him loosens ''the invisible bond," and he is free to 
follow the dictates of his desire. This sweet and

wholesome tale, although by no means devoid of 
dramatic excitement, has nevertheless a tranquiliz- 
ing effect upon the mind ; it seems somehow to have 
a life apart from the sickly everyday world, and to 
breathe an air of its own, pure and uninfected by 
the malaria of most current fiction. 

Mr. Churchill's " Coniston " is clearly marked for 
the distinction of a "best seller," and, as such, is 
fated to suffer both extremes of injudicious criticism. 
The thoughtless section of the public, looking at the 
immediate vogue of such a novel, and finding that 
everyone is reading and talking about it, is sure to 
acclaim it as a masterpiece and praise it with an 
extravagant array of terms. Thoughtful but over- 
fastidious readers, on the other hand, outraged by 
such excessive laudation, are equally certain to ex- 
aggerate its defects, and visit it with too severe a 
condemnation. In a case like this, the middle course 
is the fair one, and a sober estimate will give the 
book due recognition for its idealism, its close obser- 
vation, and its genuine human interest, while not 
ignoring its incoherent structure, its superficial char- 
acterization, its long-windedness, its affected pose, 
and its slovenly diction. As popular fiction goes, 
" Coniston " is certainly a story of remarkable 
effectiveness, and there is more of sincerity than of 
insincerity in the art by which the effects are reached. 
It is clearly a localized novel, based upon recogniz- 
able conditions and personalities ; but the author 
protests against being taken too literally, and has 
doubtless blurred many details in order that his 
picture might not be too definitely ascribed to a 
particular locality. Nevertheless, the average reader 
can hardly help fixing New Hampshire in his mind 
as the scene of action, and, if familiar with the 
political history of that commonwealth, will doubt- 
less be able to name the prototype of the political 
boss with whose career the story is chiefly concerned. 
The figure of Jethro Bass is typical of the corrupt 
and masterful politician everywhere, and he is real- 
ized with singular vividness in these pages. As the 
leading figure in a popular novel, it was necessary 
that he should be sentimentalized, and this Mr. 
Churchill has done, perhaps overdone. Jethro's 
affection for his adopted daughter may be allowed 
as genuine, but his gnawings of remorse when he 
realizes her condemnation of his practices must be 
set down to the account of dramatic artifice rather 
than to that of creative characterization. And we 
are not exactly satisfied that the young woman's 
happiness should result from a corrupt bargain be- 
tween the boss and the representative of the railway 
interests. The situation is cleverly managed, but 
it puts a severe strain upon our sympathies. 

" In the Shadow," by Mr. Henry C. Rowland, is a 
novel that opens in an English country house, then 
takes us to the island of Hayti, and eventually comes 
to a tragic ending in South Carolina. This variety 
of stage-setting is made possible by the fortunes of 
one Aristide Dessalines, a Haytian negro, who is 
the hero of the romance. He is a man of wealth 
and education, an Oxford student, something of a 



religious enthusiast, and a welcome guest in many 
English homes. His ambition is to become the 
leader of his people, and, when the time seems ripe 
for the effort, he equips himself for the enterprise, 
and makes an armed descent upon the Haytian 
coast. The enterprise failing, he becomes a fugitive, 
goes to South Carolina, hides in a swamp, and be- 
comes a victim of the negro-baiting mob. It W^ill 
be seen from this brief account that the story is not 
devoid of action, yet its chief interest, after all, is 
psychological. The author has given us a study of 
the negro mind and temperament, based upon the 
theory that he is by race incapable of real civilization, 
and that whatever external marks of civilization he 
may acquire are but the merest veneering of the 
primitive brute nature. This view is here presented 
in a form far too exaggerated to win the acceptance 
of any reader not hopelessly prejudiced in advance. 
We simply refuse to admit that the magnificent 
specimen of cultivated manhood who appears in the 
opening chapters can be one and the same person 
with the cowering wretch who makes his exit from 
the stage at the close of the book. 

The boy " who has it in him " is the subject and 
hero of Mr. Richard Barry's " Sandy from the 
Sierras." At the age of twelve, Sandy throttles a 
black snake with his hands, and some score of years 
later he throttles an iniquitous political combina- 
tion and elects an honest man to the Senate of the 
United States. These episodes delimit his career as 
far as recorded ; between them lies the boy's varied 
experience as country school-teacher, newsboy, law- 
yer's clerk, star reporter, amateur detective, and 
machine politician. San Francisco is the scene, and 
the author has a better command of journalistic 
slang than of literary English. There is a young 
woman involved, of course, and Sandy wins her by 
an original plan of campaign. 

The never-ending procession of " Zenda" romances 
is now recruited by "The Colonel of the Red Huz- 
zars," a romantic invention by Mr. John Reed Scott. 
The Kingdom of Valeria is the scene of the action, 
and is represented as a first-class power, instead of 
being tucked away among the convenient recesses of 
the Balkans. The princess is of the usual type, but 
the American hero has the advantage of actual kin- 
ship with the royal family, and does not have to 
depend for advancement upon an accidental facial 
resemblance or mere physical prowess. The open- 
hearted enthusiasm with which he is accepted, upon 
his arrival in Valeria, by both King and Princess, 
is really touching. He at once replaces the wicked 
heir presumptive in royal favor, and is made a 
colonel, a marshal, an archduke, and several other 
things without the least difficulty. The Princess is 
particularly generous, for the fact that she detects 
him in the act of placing a surreptitious kiss upon 
the cheek of the English ambassador's fair daughter 
does not in the least check the ardor of her love. 
But the wicked heir presumptive has several cards 
up his sleeve, one of them being an American 
adventuress suborned to appear at the court of Val-

eria and claim the hero for her husband. This makes 
trouble for a time, as do certain annoying attempts 
at assassination, but the villain is duly unmasked 
and discomfited. The adventuress is managed very 
ingeniously. As she pretends to be the archduke's 
wife, he gives orders that, since her claim makes 
her a subject of the king, she shall not be permitted 
to leave the capital, and she appeals in vain to the 
good offices of the American ambassador to secure 
her freedom. Finally, there is an intimate inter- 
view between the adventuress and the heir presump- 
tive, of which the king, the archduke, and the 
princess are concealed witnesses. Thus does con- 
spiracy get its deserts and rirtue its reward. The 
story is a capital one of its kind.

In consequence of the unusual in- 
terest in insurance questions pro- 
duced by the revelations lately made 
concerning irregular management of some of the 
greater companies, a large popular literature on the 
subject is being brought into existence. There was 
already in printed form probably a more extensive 
set of authorities on the subject than on almost any 
other technical question of business, finance, or 
economics. This literature, however, consists largely 
of works of reference dealing with the subject from 
a mathematical or technical standpoint. Most of 
the additions which are now being made are of 
popular character intended for the instruction of the 
average man unlearned in higher mathematics or in 
the minuter details of finance and banking. Their 
value must be judged, therefore, very largely by the 
standard which the new movement has set up for 
itself. Examples of the recent effort to supply read- 
able material on life insurance are found in Mr. 
Miles M. Dawson's "' The Business of Life Insur- 
ance " (Barnes), and in the smaller volxmie "How 
to Buy Life Insurance" (Doubleday) by '• Q. P." 
Both these books are intended for general informa- 
tion and not for the use of specialists, Mr. Dawson's 
being written for ''the great public composed of 
persons, nearly all of whom purchase insurance on 
their lives " ; while the other volume is written 
" from the point of view of the policyholders, actual 
or prospective." Of the two books, Mr. Dawson's 
(more than double the bulk of the companion work ) 
goes far more thoroughly and scientifically into the 
subject in hand. He explains with much clearness 
the technical terms of life insurance, such as 
"premium," "surplus," "reserve," "loading," and 
the like, giving a systematic and careful analysis of 
the problems surrounding each of these features of 
the business. Very much the same ground is 
covered in " How to Buy Life Insurance," but in a 
far less inclusive and thorough way. The latter 
volume includes some matter not given by ]SIr. Daw- 



son, much of this being a kind of homily on the 
virtues of saving, with advice on how and when to 
save. The parting injunction of both books is em- 
phatically in favor of the purchase of life insurance 
as a means of protection, but not as a means of sav- 
ing. Both volumes unqualifiedly favor the plain and 
simple forms of life insurance, free of extraneous 
features intended to mislead the policyholder into 
the notion that he is getting much more than he put» 
in. "Straight life insurance," with dividends anno- 
ally declared and annually taken, are found to be 
far more favorable to the policyholder than any 
other type of protection. "How to Buy Life In- 
surance," as a practical guide to the policyholder 
desirous of figuring out for himself the real cost of 
his insurance and of choosing between rival com- 
panies, ought to be found of substantial value by 
the busy man, because of the comparative tables 
and specimen blanks given in the appendix. These 
could be considerably improved upon in certain 
respects, but they are a distinct advance over what 
has been furnished by most other books on the sub- 
ject. It should be said of both these works that 
they hardly live up to the object they set before 
themselves. Both are at certain points unconsciously 
technical and obscure, requiring study in order to 
work out their meaning. This is particularly true 
of Mr. Dawson's book, which in its later pages drifts 
very far away from the ideal set in its earlier chap- 
ters and evidently adopted by the author. It tends, 
in places, to become distinctly a specialist's book. 
There is less to said on this score of "How to Buy Life 
Insurance," but that work, nevertheless, as already 
suggested, must be found wanting in that it occasion- 
ally mistakes preaching for clear and plain exposition. 
It is not too much to say that both volumes will find 
a distinct place, and will be of service in educating 
the public to a better knowledge of a business whose 
nature has too long been misunderstood by the aver- 
age man, and which so readily lends itself to frauds 
and impositions upon the public. 

When a man has written a bo<A 
A Southemer't which, within three or four years of 

its first appearance, has passed into 
its fifteenth edition, it is safe to say that he cannot 
write otherwise than interestingly, and that anything 
that comes from his pen is sure of a large and im- 
mediate reading. " The End of an Era," which has 
earned the happy recognition just mentioned, was 
written from a wholly new point of view, and from 
it Mr. John S. Wise has told a story of the Civil War 
as it unfolded itself before the eyes of a remarkably 
observant lad, who had the good fortune to be the 
son of one of the most eminent men of the Virginia 
of that day, and to be one of that immortal band of 
the cadets of the Virginia Military Institute whose 
experience has never been paralleled in history. 
Many of the qualities which rendered " The End of 
an Era " so absorbing and so valuable, are to be 
found in Mr. Wise's new book, " Recollections of 
Thirteen Presidents" (Doubleday, Page & Co.).

To these are added others which give to the con- 
servative reader a series of shocks not unlike those 
received from a too-close proximity to a •well-charged 
electric battery. To understand it fully one must 
have either from experience, or trustworthy hearsay, 
a large familiarity with the life of the Old Dominion, 
and the spirit which governed the men of a past 
generation, and one must understand a vast deal of 
the politics which have made possible such a change 
•in party affiliation as that to which Mr. Wise con- 
fesses. The book opens with a child's recollections 
of an old friend and neighbor, John Tyler, in just 
defense of whose policy is given this passage : 

" How can a man be a traitor to piincxples he nsTer es- 
poused? Tyler never was a Whig. He never pretended to 
be anything but a Democrat. He was not nominated as a 
Whig, but as an Anti-Spoils Democrat, in coalition with 
Whigs and other disaffected Democrats, the object being to 
attract still other Democrats to the coalition in numbers 
sujfficient to defeat the organization Democrats who adrocated 
the doctrine ' To the Victors belong the Spoils.' ... It was 
demanding too much of Tyler to insist that, upon other ques- 
tions about which he had never agreed with Whig doctrine, 
lie should abandon the convictions of a lifetime, and approve 
measures merely because General Harrison, if he had lived, 
•would have registered the dictates of tiie Whig autocrat — 
Clay." 

Because of a thousand things the chapter on Jefferson 
Dayis is the most interesting in the book. Opinions 
concerning this man h9,ve varied, and will vary, 
from those that regard him as the highest embodi- 
ment of all the South fought for in the heroic past, 
-4o those of men in whose eyes he was a traitor sec- 
ond only to Judas, — and it may well be that the 
historian of a dispassionate future may find in Mr. 
Wise's sympathetic sketch of his " Lost Leader " 
some things which had otherwise not been known. 
It is certain that he strikes a true note when he says : 

" It is all easy enough now to see that the Nation is greater 
and more prosperous than either could possibly have been if 
two nations had been formed from it. But much of its great- 
-Bess is the residt of the great war, and it would not have 
achieved it if the war had not happened. It is easy, too, to 
moralize now about the way the conflict might have been 
avoided but for the ambitious designs of this man or that, or 
this -set of men or that. Undoubtedly it might have been 
avoided if men had been angels. But the quarreling over the 
thin^ that led to the war had gone on so long, and had been 
so acrimonious, that a good blood-letting was the only way to 
put an end to it." 

ft is hardly conceivable that any American can 
agree with all of Mr. Wise's views of the men who 
have stood at the head of the Republic. To some 
of the opinions he sets down, it is to be devoutly 
hoped that he alone holds fast. The taste displayed 
is often a bit more than questionable, and there are 
many signs of hasty and ill-considered •wrriting. It 
can, however, never be called a dull book, or one 
lacking in a fine sense of patriotism. 



Essays of a 

Cornish 

novelist. 



Mr. Quiller-Couch's "From a Cor- 
nish Window" (Dutton) is not an 
imitation of Mr. Benson's recent 
book of almost identical title, except that both books 
are reflective and discursive, and both authors are 
interested in poetry and philosophy and education. 



and are appreciative readers of Plato. The Cor- 
nishman's volume is somewhat arbitrarily divided 
into twelve chapters named after the twelve months. 
Cornish matters, so far as treated at all, are more 
particularly discussed in "August" and "Decem- 
ber "; the other chapters handle at random literature 
and life and politics and education. The writer's 
unenthusiastic estimate of " our modern bards of 
empire," whom he finds lacking in high seriousness 
and any recognition of the human soul, is to be noted 
with approval. In the sober month of November he 
indulges in reflections on this human soul's ultimate 
destiny, but offers an argument for believing in its 
immortality which can hardly be taken seriously. 
Much as Othello declares to lago that he who is 
robbed without knowing it is not robbed at all, so 
Mr. Quiller-Couch would have us all believe heartily 
in a future existence and get what comfort we can 
from the belief, since if we are cheated we shall 
never know it. This reasoning will be persuasive 
when irredeemable paper money circulates at par, 
but not before. A new view as to the essential ele- 
ment in poetry — : or rather, perhaps, a restatement 
of Emerson's theory — is contained in a discussion 
of Mr. Meredith's scanty yield of verse, so " harsh 
and crabbed." Why, asks the essayist, do we reckon 
Mr. Meredith a poet, and why do we place Coleridge 
alongside of Wordsworth and Byron, yet feel no 
impropriety? "Because," he replies, "Coleridge 
and Meredith both have a philosophy of life : and 
he who has a philosophy may write little or much. 
. . . Poetry (as I have been contending all my 
life ) has one right background and one only : and 
that background is philosophy. You say Coleridge 
and Meredith are masculine. I ask, Why are they 
masculine? The answer is, They have philosophy." 
Despite occasional dull pages in these random out- 
pourings, our popular story-teller " Q " is worth 
reading in his more serious moods. 

. ^ , A stout volume on " Reconstruction 

Beconstruction in in South Carolina," by Mr. John S. 
South Carolina. Reynolds of the Supreme Court Lib- 
rary, comes to us from the State Company, Columbia, 
S. C. Evidently interest in South Carolina history 
is not waning. The colonial and revolutionary his- 
tory of the State has been thoroughly written by 
competent historians, there is at least one good ac- 
count of the State before 1861, and the present 
volume covers completely its political history from 
1865 to 1877. Beginning with a rather brief sketch 
of the provisional government set up by President 
Johnson, the author next exhibits in detail the work- 
ings of the administrations of the "carpetbagger" 
Governor Scott, of Governor Moses the "renegade 
secessionist," and of Governor Chamberlain the " re- 
form " Republican. One chapter is devoted to the 
Ku Klux trials, another to the disgusting story of 
the " public frauds," and two chapters to the elec- 
tion of Hampton in 1876, the bargain with the 
Washington administration, and the overthrow of 
the rule of the " carpetbagger " and the negro. Mr.

Reynolds has unusual qualifications for writing the 
history of that chaotic period ; he was an observer 
-of much about which he writes, he knew many of 
the leaders of the opposing forces, and he is familiar 
with the periodical and pamphlet literature from 
which the history of the Reconstruction must largely 
be drawn- It is much to be regretted that he did 
not see fit to indicate for the benefit of other students 
the sources from which he drew his information. 
This defect is partiy remedied by the reprinting of 
numerous documents which are of value in throwing 
light on obscure conditions of the time. Another 
■objection to the writer's method is that he packs his 
volume with lists of names most of which have no 
great significance. This, again, is offset by the numer- 
ous sketches of the local leaders of Reconstruction. 
Nowhere else can be obtained the information here 
found in regard to the character, motives, etc., of 
the radical and democratic local politicians. Though 
the work is mainly political, there are pregnant para- 
graphs scattered throughout the book relating to the 
military rule, the " Black Code," freak legislation, 
negro mUitia, educational matters, riots, election 
methods, tax payers' conventions, and other social 
and economic matters. The printing is well done, 
but the index is inadequate. The writer's temper 
is singularly placid, and, though he considers the 
*' reform" Governor Chamberlain a hypocrite and 
fraud, he is at pains to point out the virtue* of a 
number of •* scalawags " and " carpetbaggers " whose 
merits have heretofore been obscured by the faults 
of their fellows, and whose fate it has been to suffer 
for the misdeeds of others. 



THnitv Parish, ^hc task Undertaken eight years ago 
iWrtr York, from by the venerable Rector of Trinity 
J*J5 to is6i. Church, New York, of editing the 

documentary history of his parish from the earliest 
times to the year 1862 and the beginning of his 
rectorate, is now completed. Part IV. of '* A His- 
tory of the Parish of Trinity Church in the City of 
New York " ( G. P. Putnam's Sons) has appeared, 
and the set of four octavo volumes, beautifully 
printed and richly illustrated with photogravure 
portraits, views, and facsimiles of docimients, is not 
likely to be surpassed in outward appearance by any 
parochial history in America. The first three vol- 
umes received due notice in these columns as they 
successively appeared ; and were recognized as a 
contribution to colonial state, and municipal history, 
hardly less than to ecclesiastical, diocesan, and paro- 
■chial. The fourth volxmie is, however, more ex- 
clusively parochial than any of the others. If the 
purpose of the editor and compiler, as stated in his 
introductorj' chapter, " has been rather to present 
the material for a history, than to give a popular 
narrative," his purpose has been fulfilled. The pres- 
ent volume is made up chiefly of letters, of excerpts 
from the minutes of vestrj- meetings, of details of 
special services held in Trinity Church ; matters not 
lacking in antiquarian interest, but of littie interest

present volume extended from 1825 to 1862, and in- 
cluded the rectorate of the Rev. Dr. William Berrien. 
New York in those days was decidedly provincial, 
in striking contrast with its metropolitan character 
since 1876. It is remarkable that in the early for- 
ties, under the conditions which then existed, the 
parish should have accepted as the design for a 
parish church building, and should have erected in 
accordance with that design, one of the few really 
good (architecturally) buildings in America. Yet 
of this important incident in parochial hiBtorj", as 
of some others, the notice taken in this volume is 
inadequate and disappointing. Some day the his- 
tory of this remarkable parish will be resumed to 
embrace the most brilliant period of all, — the pres- 
ent rectorate, that of the distinguished editor of this 
series. In this latter period the parish has been 
engaged in far better things than pamphlet wars, and 
warding off repeated attacks upon its own integrity 
and that of its possessions ; and lias been wholly 
given to all good works. When the time shall 
come for the history of this period to be written, let 
us hope that the historian will go back over the con- 
tents of this fourth volume, and, using the material 
therein collated, wiU place it in its true historic 
perspective and in its proper relation to the times 
now present. 

Mr. A- C. Benson's volume on Wal- 
ter Pater, in the "English Men of 
Letters " series (MacmUlan), besides 
being a sympathetic study of a kindred spirit in 
literature, strikingly shows the infection that is so 
readily caught from any prolonged reading of the 
works of a pronounced stylist. This imitation, un- 
conscious no doubt, and hence the more sincerely 
complimentary-, is manifest on almost every page. 
We open the book literally at random, and at the top 
of the left-hand page read this, in criticism of 
*' Apollo in Picardy ": " The study is full of beauty 
from end to end, beauty and strangeness side by 
side. Yet it is hard not to feel a sort of distem- 
pered, almost riotous, fancy at work under it all, 
and there is a cloistered horror about it that reminds 
one of the old monastic legend of the monk who 
goes late into the dark church to recover a volume 
that he had left there, and finds a strange merry 
thing, in the habit of a priest, leaping all alone in 
unholy mirth before the altar." But this Pateresque 
flavor makes the book all the more enjoyable to the 
lover of Pater. We regret, but are not surprised, 
that the biographer has found so littie, compara- 
tively, to say about his hero as a man and a human 
being ; nearly all that there is to record having to 
do with the writer and thinker. His works are 
taken up chronologically for brief description and 
criticism, and thus the mind and heart of our Cy- 
renaic philosopher are laid open to us. Sometimes 
we may refuse to endorse Jtlr. Benson's opinion — 
as when he deplores the introduction of alien epi- 
sodes in " Marius," since to him they have the effect 
of pictures hong upon tapestry — but these com-

ments contribute to our entertainment and to the 
value of the book. The final chapter, "Personal 
Characteristics," by including an account of Pater's 
mode of work and remarks on his literary style, 
manages to spin itself out to forty-three pages ; but 
one might wish that the author, largely dependent 
as he must be on others' remembrances of Pater, had 
drawn more freely on Mr. Edmund Gosse's recol- 
lections. On the whole, however, the book is to be 
counted among the best of this excellent series. 



British ^^^ Auckland Calvin's volume on "The 
influence Making of Modern Egypt " (Dutton) 
in Egypt. jg ^ review of English administration 
in Egypt beginning with the occupation in 1882, 
first regarded as temporary, and ending with the 
conclusion of the Anglo-French Convention of 1904 
by which France withdrew her opposition to English 
occupation of the country. It differs from Lord 
Milner's " England in Egypt " in being more of a 
consecutive narrative of incidents, but at the same 
time lacks the brilliancy of style that characterizes 
Lord Milner's essays. The narrative constitutes a 
story of splendid achievement, — of financial chaos, 
administrative confusion, and industrial stagnation 
transformed into order, system, and progress. The 
story of this almost marvellous transformation is a 
remarkable tribute to the patience, sagacity, and 
perseverance of Lord Cromer, who, almost alone of 
all his early associates and subordinates, still remains 
at the head of the Egyptian administration after 
twenty years of service. The secret of his success, 
says the author, has been, not so much his extraor- 
dinary capacity for labor, his patience, or his ad- 
ministrative skill, as his insight into native character 
and his sympathy with the Egyptian. He has habit- 
ually looked at all questions as much as possible 
from the point of view of the Egyptian himself, and 
consequently has been able to acquire a larger share 
of native confidence than is usually accorded a 
foreigner. Lord Lansdowne, in a recent tribute to 
Lord Cromer, declared that under his guidance Egypt 
had advanced by rapid strides along the path of 
financial and material prosperity. Altogether he 
said there was no more remarkable episode in recent 
history than that which concerns the establishment 
and the gradual development of British influence 
in that country. 

^ , . . , Mr. Robert C. Witt's " How to Look 

Art principleg _,. „ i i- i i • t-« 

defined for the at Pictures, first published in En- 
uninitiated. gland in 1902, has now been long 

enough before the public to prove its value and to 
ensure a welcome for the American edition just 
issued by Messrs. Putnam's Sons. While it is true 
that the art of seeing pictures is not contained in 
rules or formulae, and that books alone can never 
teach aesthetic appreciation, nevertheless a book 
which takes up pictures from the craftsman's point 
of view, so to speak, — which describes some of the 
artistic principles of light and shade, composition, 
color, line, atmosphere, etc., — cannot fail to illu- 



minate with a new light works of art which other- 
wise would remain obscure to the uninitiated. It 
is quite possible to look at famous pictures without 
seeing them ; to be conscious that some wonderful 
power lies hidden there, but not to know the charmed 
word to release it ; to be bored when we know we 
ought to be enchanted. But once attain even a 
slight knowledge of the means by which the great 
artists produce their effects, once become interested 
in the secrets of their beauty in form and color, — 
and enjoyment is sure to follow hard upon under- 
standing. A book like this may and does help 
us in taking the first steps towards attaining the 
power to see pictures in the fullest sense of the word, 
— the power to decide for ourselves which are the 
worthiest of our admiration. With growing powers 
of appreciation wUl arrive that whole-hearted en- 
joyment that gives painting, and indeed all art, its 
fascination for most of us. The suggestions and 
principles offered by continual references in the text 
to the world's masterpieces are to be highly com- 
mended to the foreign traveller and to the student 
of pictures from their pictorial side rather than frocn 
their historical or archaeological interest. There are 
thirty-five full-page illustrations, covering the long 
stretch of time from Giotto to Whistler and Sargent. 

Under the careful editorship of Pro- 
?FS':^net f«««or F. H. Hodder, of Kansas 

University, the series of interesting 
travel narratives issued by the Arthur H. Clark Co. 
has been increased by the publication of " Audubon's 
Western Journal," which affords a most entertain- 
ing recital of just such experiences as most Forty- 
niners must have undergone in their overland journey 
to the far West, together with trustworthy comments 
upon natural featm-es of the country and social 
peculiarities that only the appreciative artistic or 
observant scientific eye could see. Although Mr. 
Audubon intended his notes for publication, this is 
their first appearance in print, and we are grateful 
to Miss Maria R. Audubon for the very excellent 
biographical memoir of her father which accompanies 
them. The introduction by Professor Hodder is a 
clear, concise, and consequently valuable, outline of 
the course taken by Audubon and his adventurous 
gold-seeking companions, enriched by the writer's 
extensive knowledge of the history and geography 
of the region through which the travellers passed. 
Without some such introduction the journal, although 
full of interest because of its incidents, reflections 
upon personal mishaps, and close observations, would 
lack historical perspective and the connecting links 
that make it now seem a continuous narrative in- 
stead of the chance jottings in a series of note-books. 
Some of the other features contributed by the editor 
are slight changes in spelling to conform to present- 
day usage, a first-class map to illustrate the direction 
of the journey, annotations here and there to explain 
obscure references, and a very comprehensive index. 
On the whole the volume leaves nothing to be wished 
for, either in the editor's or the publisher's field.

, " The Legislative History of Natura- 
A summary of . .=> , c. ». /tt • 

naturaligation lization m the United states (Uni- 
leguiation. versity of Chicago Press), by Dr. 

Frank George Franklin, Ph.D., is, as the title indi- 
cates, mainly a summary of the debates in Congress 
over the. various naturalization bills between 1790 
and 1860 — an attempt, says the author, *'to exhibit 
the course of opinion thereon as it manifested itself 
in discussions, reports, and legislation at the central 
forum of American political life." There is also a 
discussion of the opinions prevailing during the 
Revolutionary period concerning the status of citizens 
and aliens, a summarj* of the debates in the Phila- 
delphia Convention on the Citizenship Clauses of 
the Constitution, and a really valuable history of the 
rise of the opposition to oxir early liberal policy 
toward aliens, as that opposition was manifested in 
the " Native American " and " Know Nothing " 
movements. Unfortunately, the scope of the work 
is too narrow to give it more than a very limited 
value to the student of citizenship. As a purely 
'* legislative history," however, there is little to criti- 
cise, — except that it should be brought down to 
date so as to cover recent legislation. 



ISTOTES. 



Mr. S. R. Crockett wUl have ready for fall publica- 
tion a story of Spain and of France in the days of Philip 
II.» to be entitled " The White Plume of Navarre." 

Greneral Lew Wallace devoted the last years of his 
life to the preparation of his Autobiography, which was 
practically complete at the time of his death. It will 
be published this fall by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

One of the important autumn novels will be " The 
Dragon Painter," the new Japanese romance by Sidney 
McCall, author of " Truth Dexter " M»d " The Breath 
of the Gods." It will be published by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. 

The Library of Congress publishes a bibliography of 
writings on the " American Occupation of the Philippine 
Islands," covering the years 1898-1903. This will be 
found very useful by students of our rash experiment 
in imperialism. 

" First Steps in Muslim Jurisprudence," by Messrs. 
Alexander David Russell and Abdullah al-ma'mun 
Suhrawardy, is published by Messrs. Luzac & Co., Lon- 
don. It gives us excerpts from the Arabic texts, with 
English translations and notes. 

Mr. Egerton R. Williams, Jr., the author of " Hill 
Towns of Italy," has written an Italian romance of the 
fourteenth century, "Ridolfo: The Coming of the 
Dawn," to be brought out by Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
& Co. this fall, with illustrations by Mr. Joseph C. 
Leyendecker. 

Mr. Bram Stoker's " Reminiscences of Sir Henry 
Irving " is now well under way, and the Macmillan Co. 
announce that in all probability the book will be pub- 
lished on October 13, the anniversary of Irving's death. 
The two volumes will be fully illustrated with portraits 
and views connected with the great actor's life. This 
seems likely to prove one of the most widely read 
biographies of the year. 



" San Francisco through Earthquake and Fire," by 
Mr. Charles Keeler, occupies a noteworthy place in the 
advance guard of the literature descriptive of the great 
disaster. It is a pamphlet, with photographic illustra- 
tions, published by Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. 

" The Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville " is the title 
under which Miss Ethel Wedgwood gives us a new and 
pleasing translation of one of the most fascinating hu- 
man dociunents of medijeval times. The work is hand- 
somely published, with illustrations, by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. 

Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have in preparation for 
the fall " The Subjection of Isabel Carnaby," by Ellen 
Thorneycroft Fowler, a sequel to the author's former 
story, " Isabel Carnaby " ; also, a new collection of 
essays by Maurice Maeterlinck, author of " The Life of 
a Bee," the title of which will be " The Swarm." 

Mr. F. Marion Crawford's new novel, " A Lady of 
Rome," which will continue the adventures of the 
soprano, " Fair Margaret," is in preparation for the fall 
by the Macmillan Co. They have also in preparation 
" White Fang," which is said to be the best work that Mr. 
Jack London has done since " The Call of the Wild." 

" Erichthonius and the Three Daughters of Cecrops," 
by Benjamin Powell, is issued in the " Cornell Studies 
in Classical Philology," published by the Macmillan 
Co. The author of this doctoral thesis died a year ago, 
and its publication has been superintended by the editors 
of the series to which it belongs. There are a dozen 
illustrative plates. 

The " Oxford Higher French Series," published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde, gives us Lamartine's " Jocelyn," 
edited by M. EmUe Legouis, and " Trois Grotesques," 
by Th^ophUe Gautier, edited by Mr. H. J. Chaytor. In 
the Dent-Putnam series, "Les Classiques Francais," 
there now appear " La Tulipe Noire," by Alexandre 
Dumas, edited by M. Emile Faguet, and the " Maximes " 
of La Rochefoucauld, edited by M. Paul Souday. 

Geronimo, the famous Apache chief, has spent the 
past two years in writing his autobiography, which is to 
be published by Messrs. Duffield & Company, New 
York. By permission of the War Department and 
President Roosevelt, Mr. S. M. Barrett, Superintendent 
of Schools at Lawton, Oklahoma, has been the me- 
diiun through which the chief, now seventy-seven 
years of age, has told the story of his life and that of 
his people. 

" The Children's Heroes Series," edited by Mr. John 
Lang, is a new and very attractive venture in juvenile 
Uterature. The books are tastefidly printed and bound, 
and have several colored illustrations each. The four 
volumes now published are Livingstone, by Mr. Vautier 
Grolding; Captain Cook, by Mr. John Lang; Raleigh, by 
Miss Margaret Duncan Kelly ; and, best of all, Joan of 
Arc, by Mr. Andrew Lang. They are published in this 
country by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.- 

Dr. Otto Jesperson's " Growth and Structure of the 
English Language " (Leipzig : Teubner ; New York : 
Stechert) is an endeavor "to characterize the chief 
peculiarities of the English language, and to eiplain 
the growth and significance of those features in its 
structure which have been of permanent importance." 
It is the work of a competent scholar, widely familiar 
with English and American literature, and AN'ritten in 
the light of the most modem hng^iistic science. The 
book is very compact in diction, and for that reason not 
the easiest of reading.

[Sept. 1, 



Mr. Randall Parrish has dealt with the Fort Dear- 
born massacre, the fighting in Virginia during the Civil 
War, and the Conspiracy of Pontiac in his three previ- 
ous romances. The fourth, "Bob Hampton of Placer: 
A Tale of Two Soldiers of the Seventh," to be published 
in October, takes for its central historical theme the 
troubles between the whites and Indians in Dakota dur- 
ing the early seventies. The illustrations for the text 
are from paintings by Mr. Arthur I. Keller.

Whispering 
Smith 

By FRANK H. SPEARMAN 

A TREMENDOUS story of the 
West as it was when the rail- 
road first went through, when men 
fought rivers, mountains, and each 
other with a sure eye, a quick gun, 
and endless nerve. This is the 
West where "Whispering Smith" 
lived and fought and loved, where 
George McCloud ran his railroad, 
where Sinclair opposed them both 
and Dicksie helped them. There 
has not been a story like this since 
Bret Harte's early days. The illus- 
trations are as good as the story.

TWENTY YEARS OF THE REPUBLIC 

By Professor HARRY THURSTON PECK. L.H.D., LL.D. 
For a great many years Professor Peck has been a close and keen observer of the course of American politics. He has not 
only observed, but has preserved a wonderful mass of contemporary newspapers, cartoons, books, letters and other inter- 
esting memoranda. "Twenty Years of the Republic," from the Cleveland-Blaine campaign of 18»l to the present day, is 
written in the spirit of a man who is giving rein to a favorite hobby. It reveals not only the wide and mature point of 
view of the trained scholar, but also the many little touches, the anecdotes, the i)ersonal peculiarities, the seemingly 
trivial incidents which go so far toward making history, but which are so easily and quickly forgotten. Such a history is 
very valuable, both now and in the future. It will charm the cursory reader, and be a book of importance to the student.

A LIFE OF CHARLES DICKENS 

By GILBERT K. CHESTERTON, author of "Varied Types," etc. 
There are few men whose position in EInglish literature is more fiercely disputed, nor in regard to whom critics differ more 
widely than Charles Dickens. Mr. Chesterton's book on Dickens is intended as a general justification of that author, and 
of the whole of the gigantesque English humor of which he was the last and not the least gigantic survival. The author 
compared the immense achievement produced by the optimism of Dickens in the realm of reform with the small results 
produced by the pessimistic methods of later days. He treats each of the novels in turn, and he devotes the latter iwirt of 
his book to a general estimate of the influence of Dickens. limo, cloth, net $1M). 

BRAIN AND PERSONALITY By william haxna Thomson, m.d., ll.d. 

The object of this book is to acquaint the general reader with the remarkable discoveries of modem physiological science, 
of the specific relations of certain areas on the surface of the brain to special mental functions, and to point out the direct 
bearing of these now scientifically demonstrated facts upon the great question, whether the brain is the source of thought 
or instead the instrument of the thinker, just as the hand is. It has been the aim of the author, both to steer clear of 
technical terms as far as possible, and equally so from all metaphysical discussions, for the subject deals only with a thing 
of physics — the Brain. Illugtrated with figures and charts. 12mo, cloth, net $1,20.

A volume of clever essays on life and conduct, men, books, and affairs. Y'ou read with delight the reflections of the book-

LEW WALLACE: An Autobiography 

The famous author of *' Ben-Hur " — the book that millions have read — devoted his last years to the 
preparation of this remarkable life-story. A man who has won distinction on the diverse fields of arms, 
letters, politics, and diplomacy must have that in him which compels attention ; but this is more than the 
mere record of a remarkable career : it is the presentation of the man himself, an intensely individualistic 
and many-sided character, and one of the most picturesque and forceful personalities of our times. 

His Autobiography must be considered an important human document. It is rich in details of personal 
reminiscence, and, though profound where it touches on large subjects, never tedious nor formally historical.

intelligent and high-minded citizens.

for which Mr. Wells is remarkable.

Holyland 



By GUSTAV FBENSSEN. 

We have concluded arrangements for the publication of the exclusive authorized translation of 
" Holyland," pronounced by competent critics to be the greatest novel of modem times. Of this 
work in the German version, eighty thousand copies were sold almost immediately after its publi- 
cation. The scenes and characters are drawn from among the humble seafaring folk who live on 
the borders of the German Ocean. Their life, love, and suffering are wonderfidly shown and 
described. The hero, Kai Jans, makes several long sea voyages, of which the descriptions are 
wonderfully vivid and interesting. Cloth, 12mo. $1.50. 

Jorn Uhl

" Jorn Uhl " is the most powerful story of modern German life and the literary sensation of 
Exirope. Over 200,000 copies were sold within eighteen months of issue. The story touches upon 
many of the social and ethical problems of the day. The plot is of engrossing interest, and the 
characters almost turn into flesh and blood before our eyes, they are drawn with such tremendous 
realism. This novel will stand as a book of real worth, as a sincere criticism of life, and a poet's 
interpretation of the life of man and the wonder of the universe of God. Cloth, 12mo. $1.50.

BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 



Again the deluge I The summer is over, 
and the wonter of the reviewer s discontent lies 
in the near future. The machinery of book- 
making is once more in full running order, and 
the long lists of announcements which we dis- 
close elsewhere bear witness to the touching 
confidence of the guild of authorship, and to 
the undaunted faith of the publishing profes- 
sion that somehow, somewhere, all these new 
books will find their purchasers, and possibly 
even their readers, in sufficient numbers to 
justify the cost attendant upon their produc- 
tion. As in past years, we now once more 
seek to indicate a few of the noteworthy books 
that are already well on their way toward pub- 
licity. We confine our attention to the depart- 
ments of biography, history, and beUetristic 
literature in general, making no attempt to 
illustrate the special categories that constitute 
the greater part of the entire list. 

There is no sort of book more satisfactory 
to the serious reader than a good biography. 
Given a life that is worth recording, and a 
treatment that is sympathetic without resorting 
to exaggei*ation of praise, the product of this 
reaction can hardly fail of success. It may fall 
far short of the ideal perfection of a Boswell 
or a Lockhart, and still prove a cause of sin- 
cere gratitude to many readers. Among the 
works of this class at present heralded. Miss 
Elizabeth Bisland's " Life and Letters of Laf- 
cadio Heani " must surely take a high place. 
So romantic a career and so rich a jjersonality 
as Hearn's are not often to be found for treat- 
ment, and his letters will be certain to illumi- 
nate his books in many imexjjected ways. We 
may also look forward with much interest to 
Mrs. PenneU's jwrtraiture of Charles Godfrey 
Leland. Sir Henry Ir\'ing is the subject of 
two forthcoming biographies, one by his inti- 
mate business associate, Mr. Bram Stoker, the 
other by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, that veteran 
chronicler of the English stage. We await 
with special interest Mr. H. C. Chatfield-Taylor's 
life of Moliere, because we know something of 
the conscience and intelligence which for several 
years the author has brought to bear upon its 



152 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



preparation. In the way of modem literary 
biography, no announcement is more promising 
than that of Mr. Bliss Perry's life of Walt 
Whitman. This, we may be assured, will turn 
out to be a temperate and balanced study, free 
from the extravagances of Whitmania, yet fully 
conscious of the extraordinary vitality and vis- 
ion displayed in Whitman's work. Mr. G. K. 
Chesterton, who is to give us a Dickens and a 
Kingsley, will entertain us if he does not in- 
struct. As examples of autobiography, we 
must single out the " Reminiscences " of Mr. 
W. M. Rossetti, and the " Reminiscences of 
My Childhood and Youth," by Dr. Georg 
Brandes. We are particularly impressed by the 
unusual number of French memoirs included 
in the announcements of the present season. 

An inspection of our historical list empha- 
sizes more than ever before the fact that im- 
portant works of this class are published 
nowadays in instalments, whether they are in- 
dividual performances or coiSperative enter- 
prises. All that may now be done is to report 
progress upon works already in part before the 
public, and to note the beginnings of new under- 
takings. It seems that we are soon to welcome 
Part IV. of Blok's " History of the People of 
the Netherlands " ; three volimies of the " His- 
tory of England," edited by Mr. Oman ; the 
two concluding volumes of Mr. Rhodes's " His- 
tory of the United States from the Compromise 
of 1850"; the second volume of Professor 
Channing's " History of the United States " ; 
the fifth (and concluding) volume of Mr. Her- 
bert Paul's " History of Modem England " ; 
a second volume of Dr. Lea's " Inquisition of 
Spain "' ; a volume on " The Thirty Years' 
War " in the " Cambridge Modern History " ; 
the fourth volume of Mr. Andrew Lang's 
" History of Scotland " ; no less tlian six addi- 
tional volumes of " The American Nation," as 
edited by Professor Hart ; two new volumes of 
Mr. Doyle's " English Colonies in America " ; 
and the second volume of Dr. Hill's " History 
of Diplomacy." Two new enterprises of special 
interest are " A History of Rome in the Middle 
Ages," by Mr. F. Marion Crawford and Sig. 
G. Tomassetti, and Sig. P. Molmenti's " History 
of Venice " translated by Mr. Horatio F. BrowTi. 

The category of literarj^ history and miscel- 
lany offers us many titles, but few of outstanding 
importance. We may mention Professor Sey- 
mour's " Life in the Homeric Age " and Mr. 
Andrew Lang's " Homer and His Age " as an 
example of coincidence. We may also men- 
tion Mr. Frederic Harrison's " Memories and 



Thoughts," the " Letters Personal and Liter- 
ary " of " Owen Meredith," the "Early Essays 
and Lectures " of Canon Sheehan, " The Text 
of Shakespeare," by Professor Lounsbury, Mr. 
Trevelyan's " The Poetry and Philosophy of 
George Meredith," Mr. Herbert Paul's " Stray 
Leaves," Professor A. S. Cook's " The Higher 
Study of English," Professor Gay ley's " The 
Plays of Our Forefathers," and the "Addresses 
of John Hay." We also note with great sat- 
isfaction that the second volume of M. Jusser- 
and's " Literary History of the English People " 
is at last, after many vicissitudes, ready for 
English publication. 

From the hundreds of novels already an- 
nounced, most of which are likely to appear 
during the next few weeks, the task of selection 
is difficult. As far as it goes, the following 
list will be found fairly representative of the 
present-day activity in English fiction : " Sophy 
of Kravonia," by "Anthony Hope"; "The 
Call of the Blood," by Mr. Robert Hichens ; 
" The Mirror of the Sea," by Mr. Joseph Con- 
rad ; " Sir Nigel," by Dr. A. Conan Doyle ; 
" Chippinge Borough," by Mr. Stanley J. Wey- 
man ; " The Far Horizon," by " Lucas Malet " ; 
" The White Plume," by Mr. S. R. Crockett ; 
" Prisoners," by Miss Mary Cholmondeley ; 
" In the Shadow of the Lord," by Mrs. Hugh 
Eraser ; " In the Days of the Comet," by Mr. 
H. G. WeUs ; " The Battle of the Weak," by 
Mrs. Henry Dudeney ; " The Beloved Vaga- 
bond," by Mr. William J. Locke ; " Paul," by 
Mr, E. F. Benson ; " The Spirit of Bambatse," 
by Mr. H. Rider Haggard; "The Cattle- 
Baron's Daughter," by Mr. Harold Bindloss ; 
" A Knight of the Cumberland," by Mr. John 
Fox, Jr. ; " A Lady of Rome," by Mr. F. 
Marion Crawford ; " The Amulet," by " Charles 
Egbert Craddock " ; and " Bob Hampton of 
Placer," by Mr. Randall Parrish. There is 
promise of entertainment, at least, in this selec- 
tion of books, although the best of them can 
hardly expect to be more than " a novel of the 
year." Of far more lasting value, no doubt, is 
the translation of Senator Fogazzaro's " II 
Santo," a novel that has already attracted the 
attention of the intellectual world everywhere, 
and is now just ready for the American market. 

We wish that it were possible to close this 
prospectus with the promise of some good poetry, 
but we have scanned the lists in vain. We note 
one encouraging sign, however, the sign of a 
renewed attention to the poetic drama. An 
unnamed dramatic poem by Mr. Stephen Phil- 
lips is to appear, and Mr. Percy Mackaye, a

give us a " Jeanne d' Arc " and a '' Sappho and

of a narrowing of the breach between closet

A PAGE FROM PASCAL. 



Among the manifestations of pure genius, not the 
least remarkable is the famous achievement of the 
boy Pascal. Denied access to mathematical works 
until he should have well grounded himself in the 
lang^ges, the t«elve-year-pld child was one day 
surprised by his father in the act of demonstrating, 
with the aid of a charcoal diagram on the floor of 
his play-room, the thirty-second proposition of the 
first book of Euclid (the exterior angle of a triangle 
is equal to the sum of the two interior and opposite 
angles, and the three angles of a triangle together 
equal two right angles). In secret, and in his 
hours of recreation, the boy had thought out the 
mathematical axioms, and had invented such terms 
and definitions as he required to push his geo- 
metrical researches to the point where he was 
caught eating of the forbidden fruit from the tree 
of knowledge. 

It is a familiar truth that the development of the 
individual is an epitome of the development of the 
race ; but most of us have this truth forced home 
rather by a humiliating sense of painfully working 
out the beast and letting the ape and tiger die, than 
by the proud consciousness of rapid intellectual pro- 
gress in early chddhood from aboriginal feebleness 
of mind to a Newtonian or Keplerian quickness of 
apprehension and power of reasoning. To travel 
unassisted, in a few years of chUdhood. the long path 
of man's slow and arduous advance in mathematical 
science diuing some hundreds (or shall we say thous- 
ands ?) of centuries, was the astonishing performance 
of Blaise Pascal; and the father's sudden discovery 
of what his boy had achieved may well have sent 
him into those tearful raptures with which he hastened 
away to surprise and bewilder his old friend Le 
PaiUeur. Whether or not Stephen Pascal and his 
friend were acquainted with Plato, does not appear ; 
but had they been, they might have recognized in 
the lad's early inclination a veritable Platonic yearn- 
ing for that knowledge which is " the tiu'ning round 
of a soul from darkness visible to the upward path 
of truth and being." " This mathematical science," 
says Socrates in the " Republic," " appears to me to 
he a study which leads naturally to reflection, and 
is of the kind which we are seeking, but has never 
been rightly used ; for it is really of use in drawing 
us toward being." And elsewhere : " Geometry will 
draw the soul toward truth, and create the spirit of 
philosophy. . ." All this is perhaps somewhat forced 



and fanciful, but to the age of Descartes and Spinoza 
it was a not unf amihar way of looking at mathema- 
tics ; and something like this Pythagorean belief in 
the mystic virtues of number and calculation seems 
really to have taken possession of the thoughtful 
child. Indeed, his sister, Madame P^rier, tells us 
(to use her very words): " Comme il trouvait dans 
cette science la v^rit^ qu'il avait si ardenmient re- 
cherch^e, il en dtait si satisfait qu'd y mettait son 
esprit tout entier." 

The significant fact, however, and to us the regret- 
table fact, in Pascal's development is that he so early 
gave over "watering and nourishing the rational 
principle in his soul" (Plato's woi-ds once more), 
and chose to ciu-b his reason, to consecrate his ener- 
gies to the cause of rehgion, to devote a part at least 
of his splendid intellectual powers to the sterilities 
of theological controversy, and by a harsh asceticism 
and rigorous self-discipline to bring to an early end 
the life that might have counted for so much more 
even than it now does coimt for in the history of 
human progress. Pure as were the motives that 
decided him, at the age of thirty-two, to join the 
Solitaries of Port Royal, one cannot but feel that 
there was something of intellectual recreancy in his 
thus seeking repose and safety for his soul to the 
suppression of his reasoning faculties. To be sure, 
every thoughtful person arrives sooner or later at 
the perplexing and humbling consciousness of the 
slippery elusiveness of truth in the grasp of reason. 
We learn, after baffling endeavors to prove the con- 
trary, that truth may lie neither in affirmation nor 
in denial, neither in the proof nor in the disproof of 
a proposition ; or, rather, it may lurk bewilderingly 
in both — may, so to speak, enjoy a vigorous vitality 
in two mutually destructive statements of the case. 
As Pascal himself says in the twenty-fourth chapter 
of his PensSes, "There are, then, many religious 
and moral truths which seem repugnant, but which 
all have their place in an admirable order. The 
source of all heresies is the exclusion of some of 
these truths. . . . And it commonly happens that, 
unable to conceive the inter-relation of two opposing 
truths, and believing that the avowal of one carries 
with it the denial of the other, they [the heretics] 
adopt the one and exclude the other." Yet all this 
does not excuse the rationalist for giving up the 
fight. The boimds of the domain of thought are to 
be enlarged by him if by anyone. 

But in deploring Pascal's early retirement to the 
quiet of the cloister, we must not overlodk the effect 
on his delicate organization of that narrow escape 
from a frightful death which probably hastened his 
relinquishment of worldly pursuits. It was but 
natural that he should ask himself whether the in- 
terests that had hitherto engrossed him were worthy 
of an immortal soul that had once been aroused to 
a sense of the stupendous mysteries of existence. 
At the same time, in devoting himself more to the 
things of faith than to those of reason hp-'Hlade a 
curious attempt to silence the protests of the latter 
by devising a sort of mathematical demongtration of

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



the reasonableness of a belief in God. Either God 
is, he said, or He is not : human reason is powerless 
to determine which. Therefore nothing is left but 
to weigh the chances for and against. On which 
side shall I stake my fortunes? But must I stake 
them at all ? Cannot I put the question quite out of 
my thoughts ? No ; each act of mine implies a cer- 
tain solution of this unique problem. It is all too 
clear that I must act one way if there is a God, 
another way if there is not. Therefore I must lay 
my wager on one side or the other. Let us examine 
the conditions of the bet. In this game, as in every 
game of chance, there are two things to consider — 
the degree of probability, and the magnitude of the 
risk. Since the question transcends reason alto- 
gether, we can affirm no more probability on one 
side than on the other ; hence the two probabilities 
may be held to cancel each other, and naught but 
the naked hazard remains. On one side we have 
the finite to lose, on the other the infinite to gain. 
But the finite, whatever its magnitude, is as nothing 
compared with the infinite. Then in reality we risk 
at the utmost only an infinitely small on the chance 
of gaining an infinitely great. The demonstration 
is conclusive, and we must lay our wager on the side 
of God's existence. Curiously enough, Pascal, with 
all his logical acuteness, has here overlooked the 
fact that this demonstration proceeds on the gratui- 
tous assumption that a belief in God is necessary to 
our participation in the benefits accruing from His 
existence ; whereas it is just as conceivable that 
those benefits are bestowed on the faithless and 
faithful alike, even as the rain falls equally on the 
unjust and on the just. 

The issue of this struggle between worldly culture 
and ecclesiastical restraint is the less to be regretted 
for the fact that to it we probably owe the "Pro- 
vincial Letters," which effected far more for French 
prose than did the author's previous mathematical 
and physical researches accomplish for science, while 
at the same time these letters inflicted a castiga- 
tion on the Jesuits from which that order has not 
yet ceased to smart. Their wit and satire, even to- 
day, when the questions at issue are dead and buried, 
afford keen enjoyment. Besides the " Letters," 
we owe to the Port Royal period the fi'agmentary 
Pensees, which are really preliminary notes for an 
intended vindication of Christianity. As the earlier 
work had been an assault on dogmatism, so the latter 
struck a blow against rationalism. Despite its lack 
of form and method, it made an impression when 
published, and still impresses. It is one of the books 
that demand a reading. " You may not cease to be 
a skeptic after reading Pascal," says Sainte-Beuve ; 
"but you must cease to treat believers with con- 
tempt." Much beyond this the free-thinking reader 
will probably refuse to accompany Pascal. " Drown 
your reason with holy water," he seems to command 
us, " silence the voice of protest with masses, or perish 
with the beasts of the field." We reply, says one 
noted free-thinker, Leslie Stephen, as the old Duchess 
of Marlborough replied to her doctor's declaration 



that she must be blistered or die, — "I won't be 
blistered, and I won't die ! " 

It is not unpleasant to note, in Pascal's last years, 
a brief falling from grace and a temporary yielding 
to the seductions of secular science. Dm'ing a severe 
attack of toothache, which rendered sleep impossible, 
he amused himself with working out a certain prob- 
lem having to do with the properties of the cycloid. 
These frivolous midnight diversions he would have 
kept from the jjublic had not a friend persuaded him 
to let the mathematical world profit by his discovery. 
He accordingly offered a prize of sixty pistoles for 
the best solution of the problem ; but no competitor, 
in the judges' ojiinion, showed himself worthy of the 
prize — perhaps not having enjoyed the stimulus of 
a toothache. Those who are versed in such matters 
maintain that from Pascal's solution there was but a 
step to the dift'erential calculus : so near did that 
toothache bring him to thinking the thoughts of 
Newton and Leibnitz before them. 

Of the lessons to be learned from the life of this 
man who was from first to last so fascinated by the 
eternal riddle of existence, and who was in his per- 
son an incarnation of one of the everlasting antino- 
mies, one of the most important and most obvious 
is this : we do not see things as they really are unless 
we see them clothed in beauty — as we long ago 
learned from high authority. Pascal's morality was 
distorted. Turning morbidly ascetic, he hated inno- 
cent pleasures, viewed the natural impulses as sinful, 
inculcated a mode of life that would make celibate 
monks and nuns of us all, pushed delicacy to the 
extreme where it merges into pruriency, repulsed 
the love of sisters and friends as taking him from 
the service of a Being who, after all, may be in no 
crying need of human ministrations, consecrated 
poverty instead of seeking to lessen it, abandoned 
the intellectual pursuits for which he was so nobly 
gifted because the problems of science had nothing 
to do with the dogmas of theology, and as a fitting 
sequel to it all tortured himself into a premature 
grave. " As he brings the heart into hopeless con- 
flict with reason," writes Leslie Stephen, who has 
already been quoted ; " as he manages at once to 
exaggerate the baseness and the grandeur of human 
nature ; as he urges alternately with extraordinary 
keenness two aspects of truth, and is forced to make 
them contradictory instead of complementary ; as 
his moral position is on one side pure, elevating, and 
a standing rebuke to all the meaner tendencies of 
his generation, and yet, on the other, becomes mor- 
bid, perverse, and impracticable, because he has 
separated life into its incommensurable elements, — - 
he leaves us not a final solution but a problem : How 
to form a system which shall throughout be reason- 
able and founded upon fact, and yet find due place 
and judicious guidance for the higher elements, 
which he has really perverted in the effort to exag- 
gerate their importance ? " 

Thus the problem presented proves to be the same 
old problem that has for ages perplexed those who 
would be Greeks and Hebrews at one and the same

time, the problem that furnished Matthew Arnold 
with the theme of his best-known book, the problem 
that baffles us to-day and wiU continue to puzzle and 
fascinate the thinkers of the world for many a long 
age to come. But perhaps the best of all that Pascal 
has to offer us, and the mosrlikely to prove fruitful, 
is the picture he presents of an earnest soul fired 
with the passion for perfection. The grandeur and 
the pathos of this hopeless aspiration move us deeply. 
Probably more need the stimulus than the warning 
of his example ; for warning it unmistakably con- 
tains. " Aspiring to be angels, men rebel." Aiming 
to be divine, they become less than human. Losing 
sight of the golden mean, departing from the Greek 
soimd-mindedness or temperance {sophrosune, to 
attempt a transliteration), they commit all sorts of 
wild and foolish extravagances. And, curiously 
enough. Pascal stands convicted out of his own mouth, 
as might be shown by more than one citation. For 
a single instance, in chapter eight of the Pensees 
we read, '' C'est sortir de rhumanit^ que de sortir 
du milieu : la grandeur de I'ame humaine consiste a 

savoir s'y tenir." _. t-. ■«

"TAKING CHAMCES WITH MILTON." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The leading article in your issue of September 1, on 
" The Edict of Oyster Bay," pleases me by the force 
and brilliancy of its presentation of the " stand pat " 
side of the spelling contest now raging. The writer 
quotas a passage from Milton which he assumes would 
be spoiled by changing his spelling of " Sulphur," and 
adds : " We must take no chances with Milton ! " 
Must n't we ? Have n't we ? I have before me a photo- 
graphed facsimile of MUton's handwriting, dated " Jan'y 
10,1639," and it contains this famous sentence: "If 
vertue feeble were, Heaven it selfe would stoope to 
her." Would not The Dial " take chances with Milton " 
if it were called upon to quote this fine sentiment? I 
think it would take at least four chances.

THE DUTY OF SCHOLARS TOWARD SPELLING 
REFORM. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.; 
Allow me to thank you for your thoroughly sensible 
words on the ill-considered entrance of the President 
into the field of " spelling reform." The five hundred 
most learned linguists and litterateurs of the English- 
speaking world, if it coidd be ascertained who they are 
and if they could agree among themselves, could not 
get the foUowing of the masses of educated men in any 
extensive and abrupt alterations of the natural current 
of linguistic evolution. How much less is such a fol- 
lowing to be expected for a self-constituted group of 
men only a small fraction of whom have any claim what- 
ever to exceptionally high standing in either of the fields 



of linguistics and literature? The attempt to influence 
school boards to foist their arbitrary lists upon helpless 
children should be resisted with the utmost energy by 
every means at hand. These self-constituted reformers 
are powerless to introduce anything save disorder and 
additional labor, and all who are interested in keeping 
the language in the true path of gradual evolution, 
where it may yield automatically to the stimulus of the 
slowly improving taste of successive generations, should 
set themselves firmly against this unauthorized and 
impertinent interference.

CESAR'S "THRASONICAL BRAG." 
(To the Editor of The Dl\l.) 

When I was a boy I read in one of those school his- 
tories that shape the juvenile mind that Julius Csesar 
announced to the Roman senate his victory over Phar- 
naces at Zela by the memorable concatenation of the 
alliterative phrase, " Veni! Vidi! Vici! " Richard Grant 
White got off a joke at the now current pronunciation 
of Latin, that it turns the majestic sonority of those high- 
sounding dissyllables into the faint utterance of " wany, 
weedy, weaky," which is a poor brag. But however 
« weaky " this may sound, the Romans may have done 
what the Spaniards do in their strongly Latinish lan- 
guage : in their regiUar conjugations, except the one cor- 
responding to the Latin first, they accent in the first and 
third persons of the perfect tense the final syllable. Try 
it, and you restore the sonority. 

Then I found in " As You Like It " sarcastic Rosalind 
dealt the conqueror a stroke, saying, " TTiere was never 
anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar's 
thrasonical brag of ' I came, saw, and overcame.' " The 
great dramatist seems to have liked to refer to this 
phrase: not only is it in both Latin and English in the 
ridiculous letter of Armado in " Love's Labour Lost," 
but in " Cymbeline " the queen says proudly, " A kind 
of conquest Caesar made here, but made not here his 
brag of ' came ' and ' saw ' and ' overcame.' " 

De Quincey admires Jidius Caesar, but contributes a 
rather contemptuous kick when he says of a later 
emperor, " In one sentence of his dispatch, Aurelian 
aumed at a contest with the great Julian gasconade of 
Veni-Vidi-Vici. His words aire, ' Fugavimus, obsedimus, 
cruciaoimus, occidimus.^ " 

With such testimonies agadnst the great founder of 
the Romain Empire, I let the imputation lie in mind 
without further thought, until one day when I suddenly 
said to myself, " I know Julius Caesar too well to believe 
that story: brag wais foreign to the habit and poUcy of 
the great soldier." 1 thought of his History of the Gallic 
War, in which he tells of his blunders, — for instance, 
the surprise by the Nervii, — as coolly as if he were 
telling of Cyrus or Lysander of bygone centuries. How 
eaisy it woidd have been to comment on his own prompti- 
tude m rallying his forces, and his personal valor in 
taking sword and shield to fight in the ranks! And in 
the treatise on the Alexandrian War, published now as 
coming from him (probably made from his notes by 
Aulus Hirtius), the battle of Zela, the one saiid to have 
been annoimced so laconically, is not spoken of with any 
flourish of gratulation. Indeed, Colonel Dodge, in giv- 
ing a military elucidation of the mamceuvres of the battle, 
uses five times as mainy words as the historian does. 

Besides, considered ais something to convey news, the 



156 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



so-called dispatch of three woi-ds would have been empty, 
absurd, even silly; and Csesar never was silly. 

Who started the story? Was it done by an ancient 
writer ? I observe that Mommsen and most careful 
writers on Roman history do not speak of the words as 
a dispatch or official utterance. Canon Liddell says, 
" The victory gained by Caesar was announced at Rome 
in the famous dispatch," etc. Merivale rather dis- 
credits the story, saying, " The boastful phrase in which, 
according to the story, the Arictor amiounced it to the 
senate." 

I turned to the ancients. Perhaps someone else may 
have found more than I. Naturally, I turned to the 
profuse anecdotage of Valerius Maximus; but in vain. 
Suetonius, great gatherer of gossip, tells us that when 
Csesar had ended his wars he held five triumphs. He 
says, " Among the pageantry of the Pontic triumph, a 
tablet with this inscription was carried before him — 
Veni, Vidi, Vici, — not signifying, as did other mottoes, 
what was done, but the speed of the victory." 

Plutarch's story implies a time for the origin of the 
phrase later than any possible dispatch : perhaps it arose 
in the familiarity of a conversation. Plutarch says, 
" When he gave Amantius, a friend of his at Rome, an 
account of the action, to express the promptness and 
rapidity of it he used three words — I came and saw and 
conquered — which having in Latin all the same cadence, 
carry with them a very suitable air of brevity." This 
evidently was before the triumph. 

Is this " thrasonical brag " or gasconade ? Plutarch 
speaks not of parade, but of an expression in friendly 
intercourse. Notice that whoever depreciates his ad- 
versary depreciates his victory, and removes his story 
from the realm of boasting. The boaster tells of the 
strength and valor of his opponent : the greater he 
makes the difficulty of his achievement, the greater he 
makes the courage, power, and persistence of himself 
as conqueror. If Csesar had set out to brag of liis suc- 
cess at Zela, he would have given as many details as in 
his story of the battle with Ariovistus, or have spread 
it out as Bunyan enlarges on Christian's sword-and- 
shield fight with ApoUyon. The brevity of the historical 
account in the Alexandrian War and the contemptuous 
brevity of the tliree words show that Csesar thought 
the thing hardly worth speaking of. 

But the passage from Siietonius — what of that ? In 
that we see not Csesar the man as we know him else- 
where, Csesar the high-minded thinker and doer, but 
Caesar the politician and the head of the state. It was 
the duty of the general in a triumph to appear as the 
representative of the state and of its glory and power. 
He was officially a braggart, and must make the most 
of the occasion to please the populace. He was a the- 
atrical character, with face painted red. I can well 
conceive of Caesar as riding up the Capitoline Hill in a 
chariot, to dismount and offer sacrifice to a god in whom 
he did not believe, while saying to himself, " What a 
bore this is! Five days of such vanity! What fools these 
Romans are ! I prefer to be at my desk, but must yield 
to these throat-splitting, ear-rasping crowds! " Such a 
soliloquy represents to us the Caesar that we know 
everywhere else, the man of business, too clear-sighted 
and great in spirit to overvalue his accomplished deeds, 
pushing toward his ends, evading and avoiding crowns 
on the Lupercal, that he might be the foremost man of 
all the world and found the Empire.

The Story of a Broken IjIFE.* 



The life-story of that brilliant but erratic 
genius, Oscar Wilde, whose sun of promise rose 
so bright and had so dire a setting, is presented 
to us in a handsome and dignified volume by Mr. 
Robert Harborough Sherard, who, as he tells us, 
enjoyed the famous aesthete's intimate friendship 
for sixteen years before the gloomy end of the 
unfortunate man's meteoric course. Although 
the book is confessedly an apology or defense, 
and promises at the outset to refute many cal- 
umnies and to effect noteworthy results in clear- 
ing from the foul aspersions of malignity a name 
still dear to hundreds of faithful disciples, yet 
there is, fortunately, a wise avoidance of unsa- 
vory details regarding the events that clouded 
Wilde's closing years and led to his tragic end. 
His trial and imprisonment for an unnamable 
offense are, of course, involved in the narration, 
but are treated with commendable reserve, so 
that the merely prurient reader vnH find nothing 
in the book to pay for the trouble of perusal. 
Into this forbidding portion of Wilde's life, 
which we feel has been made too much of already, 
we do not propose to go, only noting briefly the 
biogi'apher's contention that the unhappy man 
was dealt with with needless hardness and sever- 
ity, owing in part to the popular clamor against 
him ; and that an understanding of " the dismay- 
ing problem " of Wilde's conduct is to be sought 
in a study of his unfortunate heredity and in the 
occasional "epileptiform fits " which made him 
for the time being morally irresponsible and 
rendered him a more proper subject for restraint 
in an asylum than for the severities of a prison 
cell. In tracing Wilde's ancestry, and in noting 
therein the emergence of traits characteristic of 
the decadent poet, Mr. Sherard has been indus- 
trious and has labored not in vain. A Lombroso 
would welcome his findings as a contribution to 
pathological psychology. 

Mr. Sherard's story of Wilde's prison life is 
full of pathetic interest. Its chief significance 
for many readers will be found in the fact that 
it gave rise to what are perhaps the best of 
Wilde's literary productions in prose and verse 
— " De Profmidis " and " The Ballad of Reading 
Gaol." Of the latter, the biographer well says 
that it would be worth while to go to jail to write 
so great a poem. Of all Wilde's poems, this and

the noble ode to England, "Ave Imperatrix," 
seem most likely to give him a permanent place 
in English literatvire. Included in ^Ir. Sherard's 
account of the poet's prison-life is a curious chap- 
ter which, we are asked to believe, was " written 
by one of the warders in Reading Graol"; and, 
to make it still more convincing, a footnote adds 
that the express condition on which the chapter 
was contributed " was that it should be printed 
exactly as it stood in the manuscript, with no al- 
teration of a single phrase or word or expression." 
Suspicion of even a comparatively innocent lit- 
erary fraud may be unworthy the high-minded 
critic, but svirely never turnkey wrote like this 
turnkey. In general style and vocabulary, and 
even in the details of pvmctuation and the use 
of capitals, the warders nari-ative approaches 
wondei-fidly near to Mr. Sherard's ovra high 
standard. Let us quote a single paragraph, and 
then, non-committally, leave the matter for those 
to puzzle over who choose. 

" His gentle smile of sweet serenity was something to 
remember. It must have been a smile like tbis that 
Banyan wore as he lay in Bedford Gaol dreaming his 
wonderful dreams. It must have been a similar smile 
that illumined the noble face of St. Francis of Assisi 
when he spoke of ' his brother the wind and his sister 
the rain.' " 

Turning ^rith relief from Wilde's later to his 
earlier life, we find in Mr. Sherard's pages rather 
full biographical and psychological sketches of 
his parents — the famous but somewhat coarse- 
natured Dublin surgeon Sir William Wilde, 
and the brilliant but ill-balanced Lady Jane 
Francesca Wilde, the '• Speranza '' of contempo- 
raneous literary fame. Their second son, Oscar 
(whose full name has the high Celtic flavor of 
Oscar Fingal O'Flaherty Wills Wdde, some of 
his college poems being signed with the startling 
array of initials '• O. F. O. F. W. W. ") was 
bom in Dublin in October, 1854, and not, as 
stated in the '• Dictionary of National Biog- 
raphy, " in 1856. The child was, says Mr. Sher- 
ard, a disappointment to his eccentric mother 
because he was a boy, and " for a long time after 
his birth he was treatetl as a girl, talked to as a 
girl, dressed as a girl." This injudicious early 
training extended through his boyhood, which 
was passed amidst the most luxurious and in- 
dulgent siuTOundings in the fashionable life of 
Dublin. As an example of the boy's extrava- 
gant mode of life, his biographer says : 

" He must, in his opulent days, have spent many 
hundred poimds a year in cabs. He used to take a cab 
by the day, and the first address he gave to the driver 
was a florist's shop, where he fetched for himself a 
buttonhole flower costing half a guinea, and another 
costing half a crown for his cabman." 



It was probably this early fondness for button- 
hole flowers which later led to the exaggerated 
descriptions of his use of the sunflower and the 
lily as parts of his personal adornment. At the 
age of eleven the lad was sent to school at Ennis- 
kiUen, where, it is recorded, he made rapid pro- 
gress in some branches, but was a " great dvmce 
in the mathematical class." He already " showed 
that fondness for distinguished attire which ever 
marked him in life. . . . He was always very 
well dressed, and wore his hair long." At the 
age of seventeen he was sent to Trinity College, 
Dublin, where he remained but a year, going 
then to Oxford. Of his entrance into the great 
English imiversity, he says in *• De Profundis " 
that *' the two great turning-points in my life 
were when my father sent me to Oxford, and 
when society sent me to prison." The two events 
seem thus curiously related in Wilde's mind ; 
and this may perhaps account in a measure for 
the antipathy with which he was regarded by a 
portion of the British public. His biographer 
has some extraordinary comments on this point, 
from which we will print a few sentences. 

" It is possible that when he wrote those lines he was 
tliinking that if he had never been sent to Oxford the 
extraordinary latent madness which had brought him to 
the terrible place where he sat might never have been 
roused into fatal activity. For there is no use denying 
it: Oxford, which is the finest school in the world for 
the highest ctilture, is also the worst training-ground for 
the lowest forms of debauchery. . . . Oxford produces 
side by side the saint, the sage, and the depraved liber- 
tine. She sends men to Parnassus or the public house. 
... It is very possible that if Sir William Wilde had 
not sent his second son to Oxford, but had left him in 
Ireland, where certain forms of perversion are unknown, 
Oscar would now be living in Dublin, one of the lights 
of Trinity College, one of the glories of Ireland, a 
scholar and a gentleman of universal reputation. . . . 
The man who approaches the study of this extraordinary 
degeneration of character in a scientific spirit, and with- 
out bias, cannot fail to feel the greatest suspicion that 
Oscar Wilde was to a very large extent a victim of the 
Oxford educational system, of the Oxford environment." 

How much of exaggeration and how much of 
truth there may be in this biting arraignment 
is not for us to say. Passing quickly over the 
many interesting chapters regarding WQde's 
Oxford life, we note the influence upon him of 
John Ruskin, whom he heard in a course of 
lectures on Art at the vmiversity. Wdde " soon 
began to show his taste for art and china, and 
his rooms were quite the show ones of the col- 
lege. ... It was here that he made his well- 
known remark, ' Oh, woidd that I covdd live up 
to my blue china,' " — a rather fatuous aspira- 
tion in the light of his subsequent disastrous fad- 
ore to live up to any standards in his private life.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



At Oxford, Wilde wrote poems that were 
published in various magazines, and thus entered 
upon that literary career which was to continue 
until his death. Going to London, he assumed 
that affectation of dress and manner, that stilted 
and absurd pose, which brought him into ridi- 
cule and contempt with the British public. But 
at the same time it brought him into notice ; 
and this Avas what the young man most desired. 
We are told that 

" Oscar Wilde has been heard to explain that the rea- 
son why he assumed that costume which it pleased 
him to describe as the ' festhetic costume ' was merely 
to attract attention to his personality. For months he 
had tried in vain to find a publisher for his collected 
poems, and having failed to do so because he was an 
unknown man, he determined to make himself known, 
and hit upon the device of appearing in public in an 
extraordinary dress. He adopted as the ' aesthetic cos- 
tume ' a velvet coat, knee-breeches, a loose shirt with a 
turn-down collar, and a floating tie of some unusual 
shade ; and he not imf requently appeared in public carry- 
ing in his hand a lily or a sunflower, which he used to con- 
template with expressions of the greatest admiration." 

Whether or not as a result of this masquerading, 
Wilde did succeed in finding a publisher for his 
poems, which appeared in a volume " issued in 
the best style " in London in 1881. With all 
their faults, the marks of youth and immaturity, 
the poems showed unmistakable signs of origi- 
nality and strength ; it is seldom indeed that so 
much of merit is seen in a volume of poems by 
so young a man. The book was received with 
a curious mixture of jeers and praise by the 
reviewers, but was " commercially a great suc- 
cess," and this " pleased Wilde very much," 
as he appears now to have been in very strait- 
ened financial circumstances, Avhich contrasted 
strangely with his early habits of reckless indul- 
gence. The volume was promptly reprinted in 
America, where it had rather more of a literary 
success than in England ; and this fact, and 
the hope of making money by lecturing, seem 
to have led Wilde to plan a trip to America, 
where he arrived late in the year 1881. He 
came here with a fairly good reputation as a 
poet, and a rather vague one as " the apostle of 
aestheticism " which Wilde himself probably did 
not take too seriously, his statement being that 
he came to expound "a philososophy of art," 
and that " aestheticism " was to be taken as a 
" study of truth in art." His first experience 
was in Chickering Hall, New York, where he 
lectured on " The Renaissance." Again he was 
successful " from a commercial point of view," 
as his biographer tells us ; and his success led to 
an arrangement with the well-known manager 
and celebrity-hvmter. Major Pond, for a series 



of lectures in the larger cities of this comitry 
and Canada. Mr. Sherard's chapters on this 
episode in Wilde's life are full of interest, espe- 
cially for American readers. In Boston, where 
he went directly from New York, he had an 
amusing encounter with some Harvard students, 
in which Wilde seems to have had decidedly the 
best of it. Just before the lecture opened, the 
students, to the number of sixty, appeared in 
the hall dressed in an extravagant burlesque of 
the " aisthete's " costume, each bearing a lily in 
his buttonhole and a huge sunflower in his hand, 
and paraded solemnly to the front seats that 
had been reserved for them in the crowded hall. 
The effect was of course ludicrous, but the joke 
lost something of its point when the lecturer ap- 
peared clad in conventional evening clothes, and 
proceeded with his lecture in apparent uncon- 
sciousness of the prank that had been attempted 
by the fun-loving students. From Boston, 
Wilde made a long jump to Omaha, where he 
lectured on " Decorative Art," startling his 
audience by denouncing American furniture as 
" not honestly made, and out of character." 
His visits to Denver and Louisville are briefly 
noted, but it is surprising to find no mention 
at all of his trip to California, although this 
afforded some of the most interesting of his 
American experiences, and a memorable evening 
of " high jinks " given him by the Bohemian 
Club in San Francisco is even yet spoken of as 
amons: the more notable entertainments in the 
history of that famous club. Returning from 
California, — bringing with hmi the character- 
ization, which he used with considerable itera- 
tion, ••' California is beautiful, it is Italy without 
her art," — Wilde stopped in Chicago, in the 
spring of 1882. Of his stay here, one inter- 
esting incident, relating to a since famous but 
then obscure artist — the scidptor Donoghue — 
must be quoted from Mr. Sherard's narrative. 
" On his arrival in Chicago, he received a letter at 
his hotel from a young Irish sculptor who told him of 
the misery in which he was living, and begged him to 
come to the garret which was his studio and look at his 
work. Wilde set out directly for the address given, and 
after a hazardous excursion into the slums of Chicago 
found John Douoghue's abode. He stayed vsdth him a 
long time, he praised his work, he comforted him, he 
told him the great consolation of V Art pour I' Art, and 
he did not leave him without commissioning him to do 
a piece of work. The next evening, John Donoghue, 
sitting in the audience in the crowded lecture hall, sud- 
denly heard Oscar Wilde, in the course of his lecture, 
reproach the fashionable men and women who were 
listening to his words with the fact that a yoimg sculp- 
tor of imdoubted genius who was living in their midst 
was being allowed to die of hunger and neglect. He 
went on to describe his visit to Donoghue's studio; he

spoke of the beautiful things he had seen there, of the 
beautiful things this yoimg man could do, of the honor 
he could bring to the city of Chicago if only people 
would encourage his efforts. The consequence was that 
the next day John Donoghue was everywhere discussed 
in Chicago; people flocked to his studio; commissions 
poured in. John Donoghue 's artistic career was assured. 
He came to Europe, he studied, he prospered." 

Another ease in which Wilde endeavored to 
help a desen-ing friend had a less happy ter- 
mination, though one not imusual, perhaps, in 
similar attempts to assist struggling but some- 
times peevish children of genius. The reference 
in this ca.se we take to be to the English poet 
Kennell Rodd. Wilde made great efforts to find 
an American publisher for this young man's 
poems, and at last succeeded, he himself writing 
a preface for the book. But when it ajipearetl, it 
represented such astonishing ideas of " {esthetic 
decoration "' in its make-up that the author felt 
himself aggrieved, and, holding Wilde respon- 
sible. \s-rote him a bitter letter putting an end 
to their friencLship. 

Wilde's visit to Walt Whitman is interest- 
ingly described. 

" WUde was distressed by the poverty of Walt Whit- 
man's appearance, his shabby attire, and especially by 
the untidiness and squalor of the one room in which the 
American poet lived. The place was littered with great 
heaps of newspapers, strewn all over the room, and 
over them was so thick a coat of dust that it was im- 
possible for the visitor to find a clean spot where he 
could sit down. Walt Whitman, primeval, natural, 
aboriginal, would feel little sympathv for the dandified 
Hellene." 

Wilde's lecture-trip extended to the largest 
cities of Canada and Xova Scotia, from whence 
he returned to New York with a '' substantial 
sum of money " as the residt of his year's work 
in America. He soon went back to London, 
and not long after went to Paris, where consid- 
erable portions of his future life were passed, 
and where he died in poverty and obscurity, at 
the age of forty-six. Mr. Sherard's account of 
this strange and broken life is fidl and inter- 
esting, although it suffers from the extravagant 
tone of eulogy and admiration which colors it 
throughout. It is to be taken, as we said at 
the outset, as a defense and an apology; and 
taken thus, it well repays perusal. The volume 
is admirably printed, and is supplied with a 
good index ; while the bibliography, showing a 
surprising number of titles in pro.se and verse, 
Avith translations into French. German, Italian, 
Spanish, Russian, Swedish, and Polish, gives a 
new sense of the brilliancy of Wilde's talents 
as a writer, mingled with regi-et and pity for his 
downfall as a man. 



The Evol,tjtiox or our Xatioxality.* 

Making a virtue of necessity, the earlier vol- 
umes of " The American Nation " series very suc- 
cessfully covered in short compass long periods 
of time : for the whole narrative history of the 
colonies, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth 
century, is contained in only six volumes. It 
is with joy that we now find, in what may be 
called the second quarter of this cooperative 
series, that to the same number of volumes is 
allotted the historj- of only those two genera- 
tions which extended from the Peace of Paris 
in 1763 to the close of the War of 1812. In 
this way, each \vTiter is allowed far greater 
opportunity for the elaboration of his subject, 
and those are pleased who regret to see anytliing 
overworked — even a good book. 

There are certain general principles which one 
should always bear in mind when one wishes to 
understand and appreciate any work upon the 
Revolutionary epoch. The course of events 
indeed proved that separation from the mother 
country must be a condition precedent for the 
establishment of a national government. But 
for many years, in all the English colonies, there 
had been developing those habits of self-govern- 
ment and those principles of political action 
without which independence would have been 
vain and the document of 1787 a lifeless paper. 
At that time, moreover, the necessity of inde- 
pendence was by no means obvious. W hen we 
recall that in the early years all the colonists, 
and to the very end a large and respectable 
minority of them, professetl their belief that 
colonial life might still find ample expression 
within the British Empire, we are always eager 
for any new light which may explain how words 
of loyalty changed into deeds of war. Fuially, 
the degree to which the tendency towards unity, 
but little effective in the seventeenth century, 
had developed before 1787, and the relative 
weight of it as contrasted with the provincial or 
state feeling, were matters of dispute, and the 
discussion has yielded groimd only through 
absorption into the larger question of State as 
against National sovereignty. 

The first of these points — the growth of the 
colonies into self-government — has been de-

veloped in the earlier volumes of this series. 
With " The Preliminaries of the Revolution," 
the solution of the second and third problems 
is taken up by Professor G. E. Howard. Prd- 
fessor Howard reviews first the educative and 
unifying efPects of the French war, refers to the 
prophecies of independence made by foreign 
statesmen or by travellers in America, and then 
treats in considerable detail the topic about 
which there has been most disagreement among 
writers, that is, the influence as a cause of the 
Revolution of England's commercial policy to- 
ward the colonies. The course of two centuries 
had developed a large body of laws, which were 
designed to regulate the economic activities of 
all parts of the empire. Allowing full weight 
to the argument that England's course was more 
enlightened and her code less severe than those 
of other nations. Professor Howard nevertheless 
holds the view that " the primary cause of the 
American Revolution must be sought in the 
character of the old colonial system." The 
author is thus led to a review of the commercial 
legislation of England, which, if it involves a 
repetition, in part, of matter found in previous 
volumes, justifies this by the clearness of the 
treatment. As one might expect in such a work, 
the discussion is largely external. The history 
of the system as it actually worked is still to be 
quarried from the manuscript archives of the 
colonies and from the materials in the British 
Public Record Office ; and these two classes of 
sources seem to have been little used by Pro- 
fessor Howard. 

Worthy of special notice is Professor How- 
ard's handling of the law of 1764, known as the 
" Sugar Act." This statute, which Mr. Fiske 
(for example) entirely neglected, links the parlia- 
mentary legislation of the Revolutionary period 
to the former code. A full realization of this 
reduces somewhat the cataclysmic importance 
usually ascribed to the Stamp Act, and shows 
that the latter aroused such violent opposition 
largely because its burdens were to fall upon 
a people already enraged and fearful of com- 
mercial ruin. The fall of Grenville's ministry, 
the author remmds us, was i»i no way due to 
the Stamp Act, nor did Rockingham himself at 
first consider it of prime importance. After 
discussing this topic and the unhappy inventions 
of Charles Townshend, Professor Howard turns 
aside to speak of the attempts to secure Anglican 
bishops in America. Another chapter tells of 
the settlement of the Western country, after 
which we are brought back to the narrative of 
constitutional and political development — the 



Conunittees of Correspondence, and the coercive 
legislation of 1773-74. With chapters upon 
the meeting of the first Continental Congress, 
the appeal to arms, and the loyalist side of the 
argument, this volume comes to a close. The 
main causes of the Revolution, in the author's 
mind, were economic and political, working 
throughout a long period of time ; but he stresses 
also the too much neglected side of social change. 
" The conditions were favorable to the rise of a 
more united and a freer society in America ; but 
this was hindered by the inertia of a colonial sys- 
tem which the American people had outgrown." 
Hardly any book in the series is more attrac- 
tively written than " The American Revolution," 
by Professor C. H. Van Tyne, which covers 
especially the years 1776-1783. To recount 
merely the campaigns of the Revolution demands 
either large space or very careful condensation ; 
and the author has chosen and successfully exe- 
cuted the latter plan, reinforcing his text with 
maps and charts of peculiar excellence. By 
thus carefully compressing the story of battles 
and marches, Professor Van Tyne gains space 
for touches of personal description, — as in the 
simple and impressive sketches of Washington 
and Jefferson, — and for summaries of arguments 
like that which he gives of Paine's " Common 
Sense." For his treatment of the loyalist posi- 
tion, Professor Van Tyne is able to draw on the 
results of his own special researches in that 
field. The intensity of party strife is much 
emphasized, as is also the importance of the 
diplomatic activities of the Congress. One 
topic, it seems to us, is handled somewhat less 
skilfully. In neither this nor the succeeding 
volume do we find a worthy explanation of the 
establishment of the government under the 
Articles of Confederation. Perhaps this is due 
to faulty linking between books each of which 
has strong individuality. In contrast with this, 
only praise can be given to the thoroughness 
with which Professor Van Tyne has worked over 
the story of the erection of the State govern- 
ments. The result of this, in the author's mind, 
is to establish the undoubted sovereignty of the 
States . He points out that the very federal activi- 
ties of the Congi-ess, so often brought forward to 
argue the residence of sovereignty in that body, 
on the contrary were so exercised as to show 
that the Congress itsejf made no such pretense. 
This States-rights interpretation of Professor 
Van Tyne draws from the editor of the series 
the explanation that " it is no part of the scheme 
of the series to adjust the conclusions of the 
individual writers to the editor's frame of mind." 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



161 



The conclusions of the next volume, " The 
Confederation and the Constitution," are doubt- 
less more in accord with those of the editor ; 
for the author, Professor A. C. McLaughlin, 
sympathizes with the nationalist sentiment of 
those early years, represented in the Conven- 
tion by such men as King and Wilson. Of the 
doctrine of the indi\'isibility of sovereignty, out- 
line<l by Calhoim and accepted by most modem 
publicists. Professor McLaughlin speaks some- 
what disrespectfully. *' To discuss metaphysical 
sovereignty is to get lost in mazes of intangible 
argument and of more impalpable assertion." 
The last seven chapters of this book give, how- 
ever, the best general account that is now avail- 
able, in anything like the same space, of the 
Convention of 1787 and of the adoption of the 
Constitution by the States. Written with that 
freshness and firmness that come from direct and 
intimate contact with the sources, they shoidd 
make this volume a boon to students, especially 
to college classes. 

The first part of the work is taken up with 
the story of the negotiations for peace. To the 
course of the American commissioners in break- 
ing their instructions, the author gives a quali- 
fied approval, holding that " while Vergennes 
was not altogether frank, and was considering 
the interests of Spain and France, he was not 
deliberately, treacherously, and maliciously 
plotting, as has sometimes been charged, to 
cramp and belittle the United States." As to 
the economic and social conditions of the times 
— finance, commerce, paper money, and the 
Shays Rebellion, — Professor McLaughlin's 
treatment is clear and fidl. To one point, not 
always emphasized, we must call attention — 
the fact that when finances were at their worst 
and the governments in theii" greatest exigencies, 
the people generally were rather prosperous than 
otherwise. '* The trouble was not poverty, but 
commercial confusion, vicious politics, and a 
natural disinclination to pay taxes." Against 
such human failings, even the influence of 
Washington woidd not avail. 

There are two chapters upon the development 
of the Western coimtry ; but they must now be 
passed by, and our appreciation of this excellent 
book must close with the quotation of a single 
paragraph, in which Professor McLaughlin pre- 
sents the central thesis of the whole work. 

" The political task that confronted the people when 
independence from Great Britain was declared was in 
its essence the same that had confronted the British 
ministry ten years before — the task of imperial organiza- 
tion. Britain had been able to find no principles that 



snited the colonists or that in the long ran suited her- 
self. The learned Mansfield or the faithful GrenviUe 
could do no more than assert the sovereignty of Parlia- 
ment and declare that all power rested at Westminster. 
The Americans were not content with this simple dec- 
laration of law; they insisted on other rights, on an 
imperial order in which not all legislative power was 
gathered at the centre. AVhen at length independence 
came, when the colonies were states, and especially when 
the war was over, what was America to do ? Could 
the Americans, who had scolded England so roundly 
and broken away from her control, find imperial organi- 
zation themselves without giving up all they had con- 
tended for ? Could they reconcile local liberty with 
central authority and real unity ? The work was a 
momentous one, of great significance to mankind, and 
it must be done, if at all, by a distracted country emerg- 
ing from civil war." 

The next three volumes of the series describe 
the life of the United States under the Consti- 
tution to the administration of James Monroe. 
The first of these is '• The Federalist System," 
by Professor J. S. Bassett, to whom, for this 
work, the John Marshall Prize in American 
History has recently been awarded by Johns 
Hopkins University. For Washington's two 
administrations and the single term of John 
Adams, Professor Bassett has almost the same 
space at his command as that taken by Dr. 
Schoider for the same period : but the book, 
while scholarly and inclusive, lacks somewhat 
the verve of Professor McLaughlin's and Pro- 
fessor Channing's volumes. 

The principal facts of these twelve years were 
the successful establishment of the government 
under the Constitution, the organization of the 
Republican party on the basis of popular gov- 
ernment, and the poKcy of neutrality in foreign 
affairs. Hamilton for the first, Jefferson for 
the second, Washington and Adams for the third 
of these accomplishments, are the figures which 
at once become the chief actors in the drama. 
The whole epoch, indeed, brings out sharply, 
and often in a most unpleasant manner, the facts 
of personality. Before long the country was 
divided by faction, and the political billingsgate 
became so merciless that one is reminded of the 
expression of a colonial governor, — "If you 
throw enough mud, some of it will stick." But 
more important and enduring facts were the 
building of a wonderfid financial machine by 
the genius of the brilliant Secretary of the Treas- 
ury, the devious twists and turns of plots in the 
western and southwestern border, and the loom- 
ing up of the slavery question. To his discussion 
of these leading topics. Professor Bassett adds 
chapters on " The Republican Court," the state 
of society, and economic conditions. The latter

part of the book treats of the quarrel with France, 
the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, and the 
fall of the Federalist party. 

Professor Channing modestly refers to his 
book, " The Jeffersonian System," as a " sketch," 
and gracefully acknowledges Professor Henry 
Adams's masterpiece as the foundation of it. 
But the source material is so much Professor 
Channing's own, and the book is so pervaded 
with a humor just touched with cynicism, that 
this volume impresses one as more "original" 
than most of the series. While Mr. Henry 
Adams may rejoice to have such a redactor, 
Professor Channing's views are entirely indepen- 
dent, and indeed his criticisms constitute one of 
the most valuable features of the work. He 
tries to hold to a compromise point of view 
between Mr. Adams's lack of sympathy and the 
opposite tendency of Schouler's second volume. 
Some parts of the story, indeed, even Professor 
Channing hardly makes interesting ; the account 
of the Tripolitan war suggests a pious duty per- 
formed. But this is notably exceptional. 

The book opens with the scene at the inau- 
guration, " doubly interesting, indeed, because 
probably in the whole country there could not 
have been found three men who more thoroughly 
detested and distrusted one another than Thomas 
Jefferson, John Marshall, and Aaron Burr." 
" It would have been interesting to have heard 
what Marshall said to himself as he held out the 
Bible on which Jefferson swore to ' preserve, pro- 
tect and defend the Constitution of the United 
States.' " To Jefferson, in the matter of removals 
from office. Professor Channing ascribes greater 
moderation than has sometimes been awarded 
him. Indeed, while no laudatory biography is 
attempted, the book is in a way a rehabilitation 
of Jefferson — "an idealist," says Professor 
Channing, " who was in politics from a sincere 
desire to save the nation from those whom he 
termed monocrats and monopolists." 

Of the measures of his presidency the piece 
de resistance was the Louisiana Purchase, the 
strange stroke of chance which caused or helped 
cause the volte-face of Federalists and Republi- 
cans, and which always reminds us of Macaulay's 
description, in the essay on the Earl of Chatham, 
of the two great English parties. When we find 
John Breckenridge, who introduced Jefferson's 
Kentucky Resolutions of 1798, maintaining that 
foreign territory could actually be admitted into 
the Union as a State or any number of States by 
treaty, we feel that verily things were marching 
to the tune of " The world turned upside down." 

Professor Channing passes from the political 



and diplomatic sides of this main achievement 
of the third president to recall to us the influence 
of Jefferson's scientific turn of mind, which led 
him to suggest and provide for the exploration 
of the new acquisitions. He then takes up 
slavery, the Chase impeachment, and Jefferson's 
reelection. There follows a clear statement of 
what the author calls " in its various ramifica- 
tions . . . probably the most complicated his- 
torical problem in the annals of the United 
States." This, the Yazoo affair, of course brings 
to the front the unique figure of John Randolph 
of Roanoke, whose ugly countenance and flash- 
ing invective stand out vividly in Professor 
Channing's pages. In this chapter also is pointed 
out the beginning of that rift in the Republican 
party which left Randolph in opposition to Madi- 
son and to everything that Madison wished. 

The next dramatic episode appeared in the 
mysterious conspiracy of Aaron Burr. Here 
Professor Channing has availed himself of Dr. 
McCaleb's working-over of the materials, but 
he does not accept the latter's conclusions in 
their entirety. He thinks that Burr at one time 
did meditate the severance of the West from the 
Union, and that his designs on Mexico were an 
opportunist variation of his plan. It is strange 
how many and how different men were concerned 
in one way or another with this discreditable 
affair, — the eccentric Blennerhassett, the im- 
suspecting Jackson and Clay, the arch-deceiver 
Wilkinson, who " sold his alternate oaths to 
either throne," John Marshall, with partisanship 
regrettably displayed, and lastly the irate Presi- 
dent, for once vexed out of his customary self- 
possession. 

The remaining eight chapters, which consti- 
tute somewhat less than half the book, are 
devoted to a thorough, clear, and interesting 
account of the causes of the War of 1812. 
The influence of the wars in Europe upon the 
commerce of the United States, the principal 
neutral country, the commercial policy of the 
European nations at that day, the ideas that 
then prevailed as to citizenship, expatriation, 
search and impressment, the decisions of the 
prize courts, finally the mediocre character of 
the representatives sent to the United States by 
foreign powers — all these points are taken up 
and explained. Then follows the narrative of the 
outrages which so incensed America, and of the 
continued attempts of the executive to avoid war. 
This topic is carried over into Madison's admin- 
istration to the declaration of hostilities, June, 
1812, with chief emphasis upon the diplomatic 
side. In the opening chapters of President

Babcock's volume, " The Rise of American Na- 
tionality," the same period is gone over again, 
but with more reference to internal politics. 
Party factions, as before, the American hunger 
to possess the Floridas, and the other problems 
of the Southwest and Northwest ; the composi- 
tion of the new Congress, called in extra session 
in November, 1811, and the sharp break with 
old traditions which the younger members 
brought about, — these movements, and the 
last phases of unfortunate diplomacy, carry the 
reader to the beginning of the war. 

American accounts of the War of 1812 have 
often been marred by one or the other of two 
opposite evils : — over-patriotic apology, or in- 
discriminate ridicule. From a scholarly writer 
of the present day we expect neither. Instead, 
President Babcock gives three chapters to the 
war, one to the Canadian campaigns, one to the 
fighting at sea, and one to the coast campaigns. 
While not sparing ^^go^o^Ls criticism, either of 
the government or of individuals, the author is 
upon the whole sympathetic, and endeavors to 
be just to everyone. The story of action is so 
calmly presented as sometimes to be cold ; the 
connection, for example, between the bombard- 
ment of Fort McHenry and the hymn of Francis 
Scott Key might at least be noticed. 

It is in the discussion of politics that the 
author is at his best. He has given considerable 
space to the lack of financial and moral support 
which characterized New England during the 
struggle, and to the disaffection which was most 
patently expressed in the Hartford Convention. 
The journal of the Convention, when published, 
*' was found to contain nothing treasonable, but 
it was always suspected that this journal reflected 
neither the temjjer nor the decisions of the con- 
vention." President Babcock is of the opinion 
that the danger to the coimtry has been under- 
estimated. " Had Jackson been defeated at New 
Orleans, or had news of the failure of the nego- 
tiations at Ghent been received, the overthrow 
of the government at Washington and the 
establishment of a New England confederacy, 
and possibly an alliance with Great Britain, 
would seem to have Ijeen ine^'itable. The news 
of peace and of ^•ictory saved Madison, and per- 
haps the Union." After an interesting account 
of the peace negotiations, and of the treaty which 
decided practically none of the important issues 
on which the war was fought, the latter half of 
the book deals with the results of the war, — 
of which we shall say more below. The closing 
chapters proceed with the further diplomatic 
business with England and with Spain, and 



finally the author siuns up the early work of John 
Marshall as Chief Justice, emphasizing Mar- 
shall's conversion of his associates to such an 
extent that " if the court were Republicanized 
its practice became Federalized or perhaps Mar- 
shallize<l." Whether *' the United States in full 
nationalism found itself," depends on the point 
of view ; certainly a fresh and important start 
was made towards nationalism ; but the fact was 
to be bitterly questioned in the years to come. 

If the problem of imperial organization was 
not yet finally solved, the war had nevertheless 
brought about mighty results. In its handling 
of these. Professor Babcock's work cannot be 
considered by itself, but must be regarded as 
the conclusion to the whole group which we 
have had under review ; while the results of the 
war must be looked at in the light of the whole 
preceding history. In his opening chapter, the 
author points out that all the quarter-century 
between the peace of 1783 and Madison's inau- 
guration had only served to show that the United 
States had not become really independent of 
Euroj)e, because economically, if not politically, 
they were still in the position of a colonial sys- 
tem. From this embarrassing situation they 
were set free by the W^ar of 1812, through which 
they attained " an independence which was not 
merely recognized but respected, a sovereignty 
which was at once dynamic and efficient." 

After the war, the countrj' suffered no more 
from the old irritations which had fixed her gaze 
upon the sea. The questions of neutral rights, 
impressments, etc., faded into the backgrovmd. 

" The new world was to be a domestic world. Its 
questions would be too big for the states to solve alone; 
national settlement and national action would be re- 
quired on such issues as the currency, banking, the 
tariff, internal improvements, public lands, the extension 
of slavery, immigration and the development of the 
West. . . . All but unconsciously the nation at the close 
of the war heard and obeyed the call to face about." 

Into these questions of the future, the realign- 
ment of parties, the Second Bank, the new tariff, 
westward migration and internal improvements, 
the succeeding chapters of this volume enter ; 
but these topics may with more propriety be 
considered in connection with their larger de- 
velopment in the volumes to follow. In conclud- 
ing our reriew of this group of fine volumes, we 
think it not out of order to express the hope 
that the last volimie of the series, which is ad- 
vertised to be a general index, may include an 
index to the bibliographical material appended 
to the several volumes. This will increase yet 
more the usefxdness of " The American Nation "

[Sept. 16, 



A Brief Biography of Herbert 
Spencer.* 



" English Men of Science " is the general title 
of a series of small volumes, edited by Dr. J. 
Reynolds Green, and published at a very mod- 
erate price. While they are larger and more 
elaborate than the " Beacon Biographies " of 
Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co., they share with 
these (so far as the examples before us show) 
the good qualities of readability, reasonable 
brevity, and attractive form, together with an 
excellent portrait of the subject of the biography 
as a frontispiece. The appearance of a small 
work on Herbert Spencer might not seem to call 
for special comment ; but when we learn that 
the author is Professor J. Arthur Thomson, we 
look forward to a combination of wisdom and 
style which will remove it far from the multi- 
tude of horrid little pot-boUers ; and we are not 
disappointed. Just as Professor Poulton's small 
volume on " Charles Darwin and the Theory of 
Natural Selection " (1896) has had an influence 
quite out of proportion to its external preten- 
sions, so we may expect that Thomson on Spencer 
will long remain one of the most frequented 
sources of information about the English phi- 
losopher. 

It would be absurd to give a summary of a 
summary ; the more so, since the facts j^resented 
are not new. It will better serve the reader's 
purpose to offer a few characteristic quotations, 
sufficient to show the flavor of the book. What 
could be more charming, and more true, than 
the following from the Introduction ? 

" The story of Spencer's life is neither eventful nor 
picturesque, but it commands the interest of all who 
admire faith, courage, and loyalty to an ideal. It is a 
story of plain living and high thinking, of one who,tliough 
vexed by an extremely nervous temperament, was as 
resolute as a Hebrew prophet in delivering his message. 
It is the story of a quiet servant of science, indifferent 
to conventional honors, careless about ' getting on,' dis- 
liking controversy, sensationalism, and noise, trusting to 
the power of truth alone, that it must prevail. 

" Another aspect of interest is that Spencer was an 
arch-heretic, one of the flowers of nonconformity, against 
theology and against metaphysics, against monarchy and 
against molly-coddling legislation, against classical edu- 
cation and against socialism, against war and against 
Weismann. So that we can hardly picture the man who 
has not some crow to pick with Spencer. . . . 

" In an age of specialism he held up the banner of the 
Unity of Science, and he actually completed, so far as 
he could complete, the great task of his life — greater 
than most men have even dreamed of — that of apply- 
ing the evolution-formula to everything knowable. He 
influenced thought so largely, he inspired so many dis- 
ciples, he left so many enduring works — enduring as 

•Herbert Spencer. By J. Arthur Thomson. New York: 
E. P. Dutton & Co. 



seed-plots, if not also as achievements — that his death, 
writ large, was immortality." 

It is characteristic of Spencer, that his first 
bias in favor of Evolution was the result of read- 
ing the chapter in Lyell's " Principles of Geo- 
logy " devoted to a refutation of that doctrine. 
He did not perceive how it might have come 
about (those were pre-Darwinian days), but it 
was clearly more congruous with the order of 
Nature than special creation, which he later 
characterized as " a pseudo-idea " — a "mere 
verbal hypothesis," meaningless even to those 
who professed to believe in it. 

Spencer's ponderous Autobiography has been 
adversely criticised by those who are little com- 
petent to appreciate its meaning ; in the work 
before us we find what seems to be a juster 
estimate. 

" Some one has called autobiography the least cred- 
ible form of fiction; but that is not the impression which 
Spencer's gives. His self-analysis is candid and con- 
tinuous ; he is always revealing his feet of clay, and that 
with a self-complacency which is unintelligible to those 
who do not understand the impersonal scientific mood 
which had become habitual to Spencer. He almost 
achieved the impossible, of looking at himself from the 
outside. 

" Huxley wrote an autobiography in a score of pages, 
and he never wrote anything better; Spencer occupied 
over a thousand pages with his account of himself, and 
he never wrote anything worse. Dictated in outline in 
1875, it was elaborated piecemeal in small daily instal- 
ments, after the most serious of the many breakdowns 
in health had precluded more difficult work. Naturally 
enough, therefore, the Autobiography is often prolix 
and lacking in proportion, often slack in style, and, it 
must be confessed, tedious. Little details in a picture 
may be essential to the effective impression, but Spencer 
often wearies us with trifling incidents whose narration 
has no excuse except as happening in a great life. Yet, 
if we lay the volimies aside, bored by their monumental 
egotism, we return to them vdth sympathy, and are won 
again by their imaffected frankness and candid sincerity." 

Using the Autobiography as a basis, but 
" exercising the right of private judgment," 
Professor Thomson proceeds to an analysis of 
Spencer's character and work, — his physical, 
intellectual, and emotional characteristics, his 
achievements and their effect upon mankind. 
All is so well presented, and is so significant in 
relation to the thought of our day, that one is 
tempted to class the book among the compara- 
tively small nimiber of those which " everybody " 
should read. T. D. A. Cockerell.

The Xew Order ix Finaxce.* 



Although the political campaign of 1896 is now 
a decade past, each year brings its group of new books 
upon finance. Very different in tone, however, are 
the books of the last few years from those that were 
issued in the days of the silver contest. Then, the 
battle raged about the question of the money stand- 
ard ; while the works now appearing deal with the 
principles and history of our financial system, and 
with proposed changes and reforms. 

The four books assigned for review in this article 
may be arranged under the division suggested above. 
Mr. Conant's two-volume work upon "The Principles 
of Money and Banking" falls under the first caption. 
Professor Wildman's "Money Inflation in the United 
States, a Study in Social Pathology" is classed as 
historical, and Professor Cleveland's "The Bank 
and the Treasury " and Mr. Lawson's "Frenzied 
Finance " are forced into the category of reforms. 

The book on " Frenzied Finance " hardly belongs 
to a discussion of monetary subjects, for it is a 
polemic upon the doings of industrial corporations 
engaged in taking to themselves the resources of the 
earth. Coming in the same express packages with 
the others, and having now resided upon the shelves 
of the reviewer in the company of the three books 
first named, '• Frenzied Finance " is admitted into the 
privileges of review with the more dignified treatises 
upon phases of the money question. This concession 
may affect the " rotundity " of the article, but " Fren- 
zied Finance " will be disposed of in the process. 

The largest of the books on money published for 
many a year is Mr. Conant's " Principles of Money 
and Banking." Filled to half of their bulk with quo- 
tations, the two volumes have the appearance, upon 
first glimpse, of being inflated ; yet a careful reading 
increases the admiration for the skill with which the 
well-selected quotations have been woven into the 
book. Like many writers, Mr. Conant has accepted 
the definition of intrinsic value as the real test of a 
commodity money. By this limitation, a treatise 
on money would be confined to gold coin ; whereas 
popular usage invariably forces the consideration 
of other forms of currency. Indirectly, the author 
recognizes this fact by making a distinction between 
scientific and popular points of view. It is just this 
that determines the ability of the economist to come 
in touch with real industrial life. If the economist 
is to define economic tools in language that does not 
touch the facts, he never can come in close contact 
with the people. The definition selected by our 
author is the easiest way out of a difficult matter. 
Professor Seligman, in his recent "Principles of 
Economics," uses the term "money" in the wide

sense of popular usage (p. 451). The same prac- 
tically may be said of Professor Kinley's definition 
(p. 70 "Money"). Aside from the question of 
definition, the book proceeds to the discussion of 
money and banking principles with a clearness and 
breadth of view that is really refreshing in these 
days of marginal utilitj-. Here and there is to be 
noticed an antiquarian tendency to delve deep into 
the historical details of some ancient bank or money 
issue quite out of relation to the bigger principles 
of modem money and banking. In Volume I., the 
chapters upon " How Credit Influences the Value of 
Money," " The Relation of Money to Prices," and 
the "T>T)es of Currency Systems" are valuable 
contributions to much discussed questions that show 
clearly the influence of an actual banking experience 
upon the application of theory to practice. The 
opening of the chapter upon the Quantity Theory of 
Money gives the reader the impression that here at 
last we are getting somewhere in this quantitative 
discussion : but the chapter closed with distinct dis- 
appointment to at least one reader who stiU had the 
feeling that the real point had not been touched. The 
volume upon Banking is the best of the two. The 
chapters upon Credit, Cash Reserves, The Function 
of the Banker, The Influence of the Discount Rate, 
The Origin of Crises and the Management of Crises, 
are especially valuable. The reviewer does not wish 
to leave the impression that he is an ingrate, for he 
feels under great obligations to Mr. Conant for his 
book. What was once scattered and almost unattain- 
able in small libraries has been brought together in 
an attractive, new, and forceful way, which leave* 
the professor of economics deeply indebted to the 
author. 

With Mr. Wildman's book on " Money Inflation," 
this review turns to an old phase of the money 
question under a new dress referred to by the author 
as psychological. It is the question of economic 
distress, its resultant influence upon the minds of 
the men who live in a community so affected, and 
the nature of the thought and legislation put forth 
by them as a remetly for the economic conditions. 
Professor Wildman shows conclusively the close 
relation between economic conditions and the atti- 
tude of men toward monetary legislation ; but the 
use of the two introductory chapters on " Psycho- 
logical Basis of Popular Movements in General" 
and " Particular Psychological Forces Effective in a 
Movement for Currency Legislation" gives the 
reader the impression of a discovery in economics. 
The points emphasized by Professor Wildman were 
strongly put by Professor Sumner in his " Andrew 
Jackson" and "Finances and Financiers of the 
American Revolution," and also by Professor Tur- 
ner in the " Significance of the Frontier in American 
History." Not that the author has not done well to 
repeat the positions of his predecessors, but that the 
force of the points made is likely to be lost in a too 
extensive use of psychological terms and in separating 
their treatment from the actual events dealt with so 
interestingly in the last seven chapters of the hook.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



In pointing out slowness of mind, undeveloped 
powers of analysis, as the reasons for acceptance of 
money fallacies by people of rural districts, Professor 
Wildman places the authors of vituperation during 
the campaign of 1896 in an almost inexcusable posi- 
tion. When such unenlightenment exists, there is 
but one policy to follow — that of education. On 
the other hand, Professor Wildman has not over- 
looked the advocacy of a money fallacy because it 
was productive of gains to leading citizens. This 
fact is clearly shown in the issue of bank notes 
during the land speculation period (1815-1840), 
and the opposition of the Middle West to the Sec- 
ond Bank of the United States. The continuance 
of a frontier in the United States meant that a con- 
siderable propoi'tion of the population was isolated 
and likely to be affected by emotional tendencies, 
while the numbers under similar conditions created 
a solidarity of interest which in time took the form 
of a political movement and the demand for redress 
from the Government. Willingness to yield on 
financial legislation has kept the United States in 
the boiling pot of money fallacy almost from the 
beginning. All this, and much more, has been clearly 
brought out in this book, which is well worthy of 
commendation to the inquiring student. 

The period of credit expansion is not limited to 
the days of wild-cat currency alone. Each decade 
sees it in some form. To-day the expansion of bank 
credits for speculative purposes has been repeatedly 
referred to in the comments and writings of bankers 
and trained observers. Increase of deposits through 
the medium of loans and discounts beyond the point 
of conservative banking is a matter of common 
occurrence in every large city. The third book in 
our present group is a protest against banking on 
inadequate capital and reserves. Professor Cleveland 
subjects the banking equipment to thorough analysis 
and criticism. In his opinion, too much of banking 
capital is tied up in slow assets, and too little atten- 
tion is paid to the maintenance of redemption equip- 
ment. The elasticity of note issue is a small question 
in these days of commercial paper, as compared 
with the elasticity of loans and discounts. In the 
words of Mr. Cleveland, a bank should have a cajiital 
equipment '' large enough to protect its credit and 
to meet all commercial demands of its customers for 
money without calling in its loans." In fact, it may 
be held that too much attention has been paid to the 
security of notes at the expense of soundness of bank 
credit. 

It is rather refreshing to note the courage with 
which this author accepts the American system as 
an outcome of evolution, and as especially adapted 
to American needs. He argues strongly against the 
present vicious system of helping the banks by Gov- 
ernment aid in periods of financial flurry, maintain- 
ing that the receipt of Government funds cannot 
increase the elasticity of banking paper, since such 
fimds are soon absorbed in business. Instead of 
the Independent Treasmy checking the national 
money supply, Mr. Cleveland holds to the opposite 



view. Not for a moment is the reader allowed to 
think that the system in the United States is a per- 
fect one, for the author devotes a number of chapters 
to reforms of the monetary system. Most authori- 
ties regard the Independent Treasmy as unsatisfac- 
tory and even dangerous. Professor Cleveland has 
at least raised the question of examining both sides 
of any proposal to establish central banks with 
branches. 

The use of the word " system " is about the only 
connecting link between the first three books and the 
last one considered in this article. But Mr. Law- 
son's system has no reference to the monetary system 
of the United States, but rather to that industrial 
system which has taken to itself the business of a 
great industry and out of the profits secured the 
control of railroads, insurance companies, and banks. 
The character of the book's contents are known to 
most readers, so that any review of them to-day is 
unnecessary. However, it should be said that Mr. 
Lawson's prediction came nearer to the truth than 
the most suspicious supposed. It is not always true 
that a man's words are justified so thoroughly as 
those of Mr. Lawson. The book is bombastic at times; 
nevertheless it did a great service in pointing out so 
clearly the way the game was carried on.

with an account of the Russian fur-trade and the 
exploitation of the Pacific coast under the Russian 
American Fur Company and the renowned leader 
Baranof . Peter the Great's laconic instructions to 
Bering were, to build two boats at Kamchatka, with 
these to sail northward along the coast, to inquire 
where the American coast begins, to chart this un- 
known coast, and return. Peter died before his 
wishes could be obeyed ; but Vitus Bering, having 
received his orders, rested not until they had been 
fulfilled. The story of his wonderful joui-ney across 
two continents, in the face of obstacles of every 
kind ; of the building and equipment of his boats ; 
of his voyage out into the unknown ; of his discov- 
ery of the American coast ; and of his death, worn 
out in the service of his adopted and ungrateful 
country, on the little island that now bears his 
name, is all admirably told by Miss Laut. She 
gives us a picture of the brave and tii-eless Dane 
that one would not willingly have missed. The 
story of Benyowsky, the Polish pirate, furnishes one 
of the most extraordinary incidents of a romantic 
period. Sent as an exUe to Siberia, he drew his 
fellow-prisoners into a plot to escape ; by a daring 
piece of forgery they were transferred to Bolcheresk, 
the capital of Kamchatka, as the most promising 
point from which to escape the country ; here arms 
and supplies were obtained and secreted, the fort 
was surprised by a clever ruse, a vessel seized, the 
Polish flag run up to the mast-head, and Benyowsky 
and his wild crew set forth on a melodramatic 
voyage to the South Seas, or some equally vague 
destination. Benyowsky finally came to grief in a 
characteristically wild attempt to conquer Mada- 
gascar and set up an independent government. In 
telling the story of this engaging buccaneer, Miss 
Laut finds opportunity for a very interesting descrip- 
tion of Bolcheresk, its Cossack garrison and its 
extraordinary medley of squalor and luxury. From 
an historical point of view, perhaps the most valu- 
able chapter in the book is that which deals with 
the voyage of the " Columbia " and Robert Gray's 
discovery of the greatest river of the Pacific coast. 
The world was long ago made familiar with the 
explorations of Drake, Cook, and Vancouver, but 
little has been known, and less understood, of the 
exploits of the Bostonian navigator. Miss Laut has 
gathered together the scattered fragments, and out 
of them has woven a connected story. The useful- 
ness of her book has been heightened by the addition 
to each chapter of brief bibliographical references, 
and its attractiveness is increased by a number of 
weU-selected illustrations. (Macmillan Co.)

confronted ; the conflict of Federal and State activities ; 
the Northern opposition to the war ; the draft ; and 
the various mistakes and some of the good measures 
of the Washington authorities. The field is ah inter- 
esting one ; the author lived through the period of 
which he treats, and has had access to the records, 
published and unpublished; but it cannot be said 
that the work is a success. It brings out little that 
is new, and is not nearly so clear and satisfactory as 
Mr. Rhodes's briefer treatment of the same subjects. 
Mr. AVeeden has several handicaps, chief among 
them being a lack of the historical attitude of mind. 
He begins with certain assumptions and goes on to 
prove certain theses, rejecting all that conflicts with 
his views, which appear to be those of the heat and 
passion of 1861-1865 as regards Northern Demo- 
crats, though he has forgiven the Southern " rebel." 
In his opinion, the Union, or American Nation, is 
not a thing of slow evolution, but dates even back 
of the 1789 beginning; the theories of to-day are 
projected back of 1861, and this is justified by say- 
ing that the Constitution of 1865 was the same as 
that of 1789 and therefore the Union was the same, 
etc. The author seems not to have the slightest con- 
ception of what was meant by the theories of State 
Rights and Secession, and of the distinction between 
the two. To him, the views of Calhoun and Seymour 
were identical. Though widely read in political sci- 
ence, Mr. Weeden seems to suffer from a certain 
vague-mindedness, an inability to grasp fundamental 
principles ; and in consequence his theories are con- 
fused and contradictory. In fact, he seems to have 
adopted as scientific principles the heated patriotic 
editorial arguments of the war time. As an old 
soldier, Mr. Weeden has great respect for the 
" rebels," but those " abortive and mischievous crea- 
tures" the Northern Democrats or "copperheads" 
— how he despises them ! The Radicals as com- 
pared with them, were, as he says, as "Grabriel 
and Michael arrayed against Satan and Moloch." 
Lincoln is criticised severely — the old New En- 
gland criticism ; and while also praised, it is the 
praise of one who does not understand. The author 
believes that the patriotic enthusiasms of 1861 placed 
at Lincoln's disposal resources with which he might 
have made a quick end of the war; instead, the 
administration put on the dampers, and uselessly 
prolonged the struggle. Curiously enough, this is 
precisely the same criticism now directed against 
Jefferson Davis by ex-Confederate wiseacres ; and 
one criticism is worth about as much as the other. 
Mr. Lincoln was working, in 1861, with the light of 
1861, not of 1906. The author's dislike of those 
on the other side and his failure to appreciate their 
position, his inability to recognize and understand 
the principle of evolution in human affairs, and 
his twentieth century criticism of nineteenth cen- 
turj' deeds, are defects that mar a work which 
otherwise might have been of considerable interest 
and value.

THE DlAl^ 



[Sept. 16^ 



The hioaraphv ^^ ^« ninety-nine years since Montagu 
of a famous Pennington, Mrs. Carter's nephew 
bluestocking. g^jjd executor, published the "Memoirs 
of the Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Carter." This work, 
which must have been Miss Alice C. C. Gaussen's 
chief source of information in writing her book, " A 
Woman of Wit and Wisdom " ( Button), is not men- 
tioned in the acknowledgments at the end of her 
preface. Her volume is handy and attractive, and 
shows evidences of zeal and industry ; and interest 
in the accomplished woman who first popularized 
Epictetus for English-speaking readers, and who was 
pronounced by Johnson the best Greek scholar of 
his time, may be expected to win for the book a 
considerable number of readers. But whether Eliz- 
abeth Carter's life was too uneventful to supply 
material for a volume of 250 pages, or whether her 
latest biographer has failed to make the most of the 
lady's voluminous letters and other memorials, certain 
it is that " A Woman of Wit and Wisdom " contains 
passages remarkable for neither wisdom nor wit. 
Platitude and padding have not been excluded. In- 
accuracies have crept in. For example, we read 
that the Epictetus " brought her in 1000^," and that 
it " made her independent and enabled her to pass 
every winter in lodgings in Clarges Street." The 
translator's receipts actually fell short of the amount 
here named, but even 1000^ is hardly an indepen- 
dent fortune. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Elizabeth 
Montagu in 1775 settled an annuity of lOOZ. on her 
friend and fellow-bluestocking, and it is probable 
that Dr. Carter provided also for his daughter at his 
death, as he had looked out for her in his lifetime. 
(Let it here be recalled that "Mrs." in Elizabeth 
Carter's case was a courtesy title only.) Among 
other matters for criticism may be noted Miss Gaus- 
sen's excessive praise of Xenophon as a general 
and a philosopher, in her comments on the Epictetus. 
After speaking on an early page of " the mushroom 
growth of a new language filled with phrases which 
nobody could have understood when she [Mrs. Carter] 
was young," the writer is guilty of the following, as 
faulty in syntax as it is objectionable in vocabulary : 
" With grim humour he would allow an importunate 
fair one to pass, knowing that her farther progress 
was barred by a solid barrier of high seats that no 
persuasion could move, and that impeded by a train 
and veU it would be impossible to negotiate." We 
wish Miss Gaussen had made it plain which house 
lived in by her heroine was known as the Vinegar 
Bottle. Good portraits enliven the volume, but no 
index consummates the whole. 



Freedom of the ^he Toppan prize of Harvard Uni- 
eariv "press in versity was awarded in 1897 to Mr. 
Massachusetts. Qy,Je Augustus Duniway for a mon- 
ograph entitled " The Development of Freedom of 
the Press in Massachusetts." It is now reprinted 
in the series of " Harvard Historical Studies" (Long- 
mans, Green & Co. ). After a preliminary chapter on 
the control of the press in England, the author trans- 
fers his investigations to Massachusetts, and traces 



in chronological order the events which marked the 
decline of authority over the press in the New World. 
He shows that censorship was due primarily to the 
union of church and state, whereby the state assumed 
the task of suppressing heresies and seditions. That 
the Puritans in Massachusetts should adopt a censor- 
ship of the press, whUe disavowing the authority of 
the church, is attributed to the power of imitation 
and established custom. " For the preventing of 
irregularities & abuse to the authority of this country 
by the printing presse " was sufiicient warrant for 
controlling the printer — a control which, however^ 
was never enforced as rigidly in the colonies as in 
the mother country. A most interesting part of the 
study is that devoted to the numerous local contests- 
between the " patriots " and the colonial authorities 
in the inauguration of the American Revolution. 
After the establishment of Independence, censorship 
was assumed by the state only in the protection of 
the individual from libel. Here the author traces 
the gradual changes in public sentiment which led 
ultimately to more tolerance of the press and to the 
Massachusetts libel law of 1827. *' The passage of 
this act," concludes Mr. Duniway, " marked the 
removal of the last substantial legal restriction upon 
the freedom of the press in Massachusetts." Abund- 
ant footnotes, with references and appendices, attest 
the scholarly investigation, the authoritativeness, and 
the excellence of this study of the early press in 
Massachusetts. 

In " How Ferns Grow " (Holt) Miss 
^FernBook. Margaret Slosson gives us the latest 

word concerning this most fascinat- 
ing group of flowerless plants. Miss Slosson argues, 
somewhat by way of apology, that since the frond 
or leaf of the fern plays so important apart in classi- 
fication and identification, it would seem well that 
the various stages along which the leaf comes to 
maturity, or perf ectness of form, were more minutely 
known. The growth referred to in the title has 
reference, accordingly, to the leaf alone, and '' How 
the fern frond grows " would appear to have been a 
preferable inscription. The volume consists largely 
of illustrations — full-page, sometimes double-page, 
plates, half-tone reproductions of photographs repr^ 
senting more or less perfectly the fern-leaf's progress 
toward completion. Eighteen species only, chosen 
from the flora of the northeastern United States, are 
thus delineated. The text in each case includes a 
formal description of the species concerned, a setting- 
f orth of the facts of distribution and synonymy, and 
such notes explanatory of the plates and figures as 
seem necessary to bring out the results of the investi- 
gation. Miss Slosson has conscientiously followed 
her subject, and some of her discoveries no doubt 
thi'ow light upon the phy tology of the gi'oup — upon 
the affinities of so-called genera, for instance, a 
subject on which any light is especially welcome. 
The work is, of course, almost purely technical, and 
makes but small appeal to the interest of the general 
reader.

A Confederate Some of the best matenals for history

chaplain, after- ^'^ lound m unpretentious recprds of 
wards bishop. events, or life-stories of interesting 
personalities. Among these may be counted " Doctor 
Quintard, Chaplain C. S. A. and Second Bishop of 
Tennessee." a small volume prepared by the Rev. 
Arthur Howard NoU, and published by the Uni- 
versity Press of Sewanee, Tennessee. The book 
contains a plain narrative of Dr. Quintard's four 
years of very active service in the Confederate army 
— a double activity, in fact, for the good doctor 
ministered both to the bodies of the soldiers as army 
surgeon and to their souls as chaplain, and in both 
capacities did most efficient service. He was, withal, 
an exceedingly attractive and lovable man, and was 
on terms of intimacjr with a large number of the 
generals and leading men of the Confederacy ; he is 
thus able to take his readers behind the scenes and 
show them both the personalities of the leaders 
and the condition of feeling in the South at different 
stages of the war. This is done only incidentally, 
but is the more valuable for this reason. The story 
of Dr. Quintard's arduous and successful episcopal 
labors after the war. given in the two closing chap- 
ters of the book. wUl also prove interesting to other 
readers besides those of his own church. 



The cloudy 
architecture 
of the sky. 



Lovers of nature and of art will find 
a new field of exploration opened to 
them in Professor Clay don's '' Qoud 
Studies " (Dutton) . Those who find aesthetic enjoy- 
ment in the beauty of form, light, and color of the 
heavens, or who seek to portray this element of the 
landscape with brush or pencU, will find here a scien- 
tific treatment that will widen the horizon of enjoy- 
ment and tend to bring accuracy and order where 
art is often weak and vague. A study of the clouds 
in our best art galleries wUl reveal the misconceptions 
under which many artists labor as to the architecture 
of the sky. Not only the nature-lover and the artist, 
but the meteorologist as well, will find much of value 
and interest in this book. The author employs the 
international code of cloud nomenclature, but urges 
its extension to include the manifold varieties that 
occur in nature, many of which he describes in his 
text. The book is illustrated with over sixtj- full-page 
plates, and contains practical suggestions for study- 
ing the sky and measuring the altitude of clouds, a 
valuable chapter on cloud-photography, and a bibli- 
ography. 

XOTES. 



" A History of the Northern Securities Case," by 
Professor Balthasar Henry Meyer, is a recent mono- 
graph published by the University of Wisconsin. 

"Farquhar," edited by ^Ir. William Archer, is now 
added to the tliin-paper reprint of the " Mermaid 
Series," imported by the Messrs. Scribner. From the 
same source we have the fourth English edition of 
Baedeker's " Palestine and Syria," most useful of all 
guide-books to the Holy Land. 



" Lucian: Selected Writings," edited by Prof. Francis 
Greenleaf Allinson, is added to the " CoUege Series of 
Greek Authors," published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

" The Sources of Tyndale's Version of the Penta- 
teuch," by Mr. John Roth well Slater, is a doctoral 
dissertation issued from the University of Chicago Press. 
The author's main conclusion is that Tyndale " kept 
constantly before him the Hebrew text and Luther's 
version, with the Septuagint and Vulgate within easy 
reach, and fragments of the Middle English archaisms 
running through his mind as he worked." A series of 
passages in seven parallel columns serves to bear out 
these contentions. 

The first volume of Mr. Russell Sturgis's " History of 
Architecture " is nearing completion, and wiU be pub- 
lished in the early autumn by the Baker & Taylor Co. 
An important feature of this work will be the careful 
study of the climatic influences on architecture and of 
the relation of the domestic to the monumental archi- 
tecture in various countries — a field which has been 
somewhat neglected by architectural writers. The first 
volume will deal with the architecture of Egypt, Western 
Asia, Greece, Etruria, and Rome. 

An important new library edition of the works of 
Plutarch is an interesting autumn announcement of 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. There will be ten vol- 
umes in the set, consisting of Dryden's translation of 
Plutarch's Lives, in five volumes, corrected from the 
Greek and revised by A. H. Clough; and Plutarch's 
Essays and Aliscellanies, in five volumes, comprising 
all his writings collected under the title of " Morals," 
translated from the Greek by several hands, corrected 
from the Greek and revised by W. W. Goodwin, Ph.D., 
with an introduction by R. W. Emerson. Each volume 
contains a photogravure frontispiece. 

Two interesting " Riverside Press Editions " are an- 
nounced for autumn pubUcation by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. These will consist of a foho reprint of 
the French epic, " The Song of Roland," in Miss Isabel 
Butler's translation, with seven hand-colored illustra- 
tions derived from the window of Charlemagne in the 
Cathedral at Chartres ; and an octavo edition of the Idylls 
of Theocritus, as translated by Charles Stuart Calver- 
ley, with decorative wood-engravings by M. Lamont 
Brown. In their series of " Special Limited Editions," 
the same firm wiU publish " The Familiar Letters of 
James Howell," in four volumes, with an introduction 
by Miss Agnes Repplier ; and a " BibUography of Oliver 
Wendell Holmes," compiled by Mr. George B. Ives. 

The following books having to do with Italy and its 
associations find place in the autumn announcement 
list of Messrs A. C. McClurg & Co.: "The History of 
Venice," by Senator Pompeo Molmenti, translated by 
Mr. Horatio F. Brown, British archivist in Venice, to 
be completed in six volumes; a new edition of George 
EHot's " Romola," edited by Dr. Guido Biagi, librarian 
of the Laurentian and Riccardi Ubraries in Florence, with 
an introduction, notes, and one hundred and sixty rare 
engravings; "With Byron in Italy," edited by Mrs. 
Anna B. McMahan, containing all the extracts from the 
poet's verses, letters, and diary which throw fight on his 
sojourn in Italy from 1817 to 1823; "The Guilds of 
Florence," an illnstrat«d octavo by Mr. Edgcumbe 
Staley ; and a novel of fourteenth century Italy entitled 
" Ridolfo: The Coming of the Dawn," by Mr. Edgerton 
R. Williams, Jr., author of " Hill Towns' of Italy." AU 
of these volumes will be illustrated.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



ANXOLTXCEMEXT IjIST OF FALL, BOOKS. 



Nearly 1700 titles of new books, representing about sixty 
American publishing houses, are given in the classified list 
below as the prospective output for the coming season. These 
announcement lists, carefully prepared from the earliest and 
most authentic sources especially for our pages, have for 
many years been a special feature of The Dial ; and their 
usefulness and interest, both to the book trade and the book 
public, have long been recognized in a way to justify the labor 
and space required for their presentation. They not only 
show at a glance what books are coming out in any depart- 
ment of literature, but make a complete showing of the 
principal publishing activity of the year. The present list 
is the largest, with one exception, we have ever presented ; 
indicating a healthy activity in the publishing trade. All 
the books entered are presumably new books — new editions 
not being included unless having new form or matter ; and 
while no attempt has been made to include titles as titles 
merely, regardless of their significance or interest to our 
readers, yet it is believed that no really important book is 
missing from the list. Some of its more interesting features 
are conamented on in the leading editorial in this issue of 
The Dial.

1906] THE DIAL 1»6 



KEEPING UP WITH THE MAGAZINES 

without giving all one's time to them is a task of ever-increasing 
difficulty. CThis is decidedly the magazine age. The number, 
variety, and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than 
amazing. The master-minds of the world go to their making, — the 
greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month,. with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library 
index. Everything is arranged and classified, simply but exactly; 
whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ- 
ers or merely looking out for good things in general, the arrangement 
is equally convenient. C. It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine- 
land, — a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell; 
and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person.

KEEPING UP WITH THE MAGAZINES 

without giving all one's time to them is a task of ever-increasing 
difficulty. CThis is decidedly the magazine age. The number, 
variety, and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than 
amazing. The master-minds of the world go to their making, — the 
greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month, with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library 
index. Everything is arranged and classified, simply but exactly; 
whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ- 
ers or merely looking out for good things in general, the arrangement 
is equally convenient. C. It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine- 
land, — a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell; 
and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person.

''ACCORDING TO MEREDITH." 

The above i.s the title of a singularly clever 
and well-written story published in a recent 
number of " The Fortnightly Review," and 
based upon Mr. Meredith's suggestion, reported 
some two years ago in one of the London news- 
papers, to the effect that marriage for a limited 
period was among the possibilities of the future. 
Mrs. Lowndes, the author of this story, was 
evidently horrified by the suggestion, and her 
fancy readily evoked a tragic situation made to 
arise from the literal application of such a plan 
of limited marital tenure. We are not now par- 
ticularly concerned with this startling proposi- 
tion, nor do we profess to understand why Mr. 
Meredith made it, or with what qualifications it 
was advanced. We shoidd be inclinetl to regard 
it as a forecast rather than as a plea, although 
it is possible that Mr. Meredith's strong indi- 
vidualism and love of liberty may have led him 
to consider favorably so radical a transforma- 
tion of one of the most fimdamental of social 
relations. At all events, he is a man whose 
ideas must be reckoned with, even if they run 
counter to our dearest prejudices ; and we make 
free to borrow the title of the story, not for the 
purpose of taking up its special theme, but 
merely as a peg upon which to hang a few obser- 
vations upon Mr. Meredith's general attitude 
toward his feUow-men and the world in which 
they live. 

We have been led to this subject by i*eading 
Mr. G. M. Trevelyan's extremely interesting 
little book on " The Poetry and Philosophy of 
George Meredith," which has come to our desk 
among the recent importations of the Messrs. 
Scribner. The writer belongs to the younger 
generation of thoughtfid Englishmen to whom 
Mr. Meredith's message, ignored by his con- 
temporaries, now comes as a vitalizing influence, 
and who are determined to repair the neglect 
which the poet's fame has hitherto suffered. 
He writes as an enthusiast, although admiration 
does not often blind his judgment, and he ex- 
pounds the poet's doctrine in an engaging man- 
ner, citing chapter and verse whenever needed 
to illustrate the points at issue. No one, we 
shoidd say, coidd fail to be interested by this 
sympathetic and intelligent exposition, and even 



194 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



those who are well acquainted with the poet are 
likely to find it illuminating. 

Mr, Meredith is essentially a poet of the 
positive scientific spirit, of temperamental opti- 
mism, and of the joy of earth. We should 
really write Earth with a capital, as Mr. Trev- 
elyan does ; for to this poet she is the spiritual 
mother, the source of all man's strength, the 
true inspiration of all his highest endeavor. 

" He builds the soaring spires, 
That sing his soul in stone — of her he draws 
Though blind to her, by spelling at her laws, 
Her purest fires. 

" Through him hath she exchanged 
For the gold harvest-robes, the mural crown, 
Her haggard quarry-features, and thick frown 
Where monsters ranged. 

" And order, high discourse. 
And decency, than which is life less dear, 
She has of him : the lyre of language clear, 
Love's tongue and source." 

Thus man repays to her his debt, and in close 
communion with her works out the secret pur- 
pose for which she created him. And in the 
end, if he has known and loved her aright, he 
may ask the question that really needs no answer : 

" Into the breast that gives the rose 
Shall I with shuddering fall? " 

Clearly, this is no philosophy of despair, nor 
is it a philosophy of the sensual gratification 
which certain dull soids imagine to be all that 
woidd remain to us were we to part company 
with their metaphysical idols. The deepest wis- 
dom of Goethe is thus expressed anew for us : 
" We do not get to any heaven by renouncing 
the Mother we spring from ; and when there is 
an eternal secret for us, it is best to believe that 
Earth knows, to keep near her, even in our ut- 
most aspirations." What truth and inspiration 
there is in this sentence, and in the following 
verses which may be taken as its complement I 

" She can lead us, only she, 

Unto God's footstool, whither she reaches. 
Loved, enjoyed her gifts must be ; 
Reverenced the truths she teaches." 

And foremost among those truths is the moral 
responsibility of the individual, the realization 
of the law that man must be 

" Obedient to Nature, not her slave ; 

Her lord, if to her rigid laws he bows ; 
Her dust, if with his conscience he plays knave, 
And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse." 

A nobler scorn of the life of self-indidgence has 
never been breathed, a finer lesson of the ethics 
of self-sacrifice has never been read, than comes 
to us in the song of Camilla, who in "Vittoria " 
is the mouthpiece through which Mazzini speaks. 



" Our life is but a little holding, lent 

To do a mighty labour. We are one 
With heaven and the stars when it is spent 

To serve God's aim : else die we with the sun." 

This may fairly be set beside the austere message 
of Mr. Swinburne's " Super FlimiinaBabylonis," 
a poem also kindled at Mazzini "s altar. 

Mr. Meredith sounds the note of exultant 
individualism, strong to achieve and equally 
strong to endure, in verses that remind us of 
Henley's defiant challenge to adverse circum- 
stance. 

" Ay, be we faithful to ourselves : despise 
Nought but the coward in us ! That way lies 
The wisdom making passage through our slough. 
Am I not heard, my head to Earth shall bow ; 
Like her, shall wait to see, and seeing wait. 
Philosophy is Life's one match for Fate." 

Of all cowardice, the most abject is that which 
tries to shuffle upon environment the responsi- 
bility for a man's acts, and of all hypocrisy the 
most contemptible is that which would make of 
cowardice a virtue. 

" I am not of those miserable males 
Who sniff at vice, and, daring not to snap, 
Do therefore hope for heaven. I take the hap 
Of all my deeds. The wind that fills my sails, 
Propels ; but I am helmsman. Am I wrecked '? 
I know the devil has sufficient weight 
To bear : I lay it not on him, or fate. 
Besides, he 's damned. That man I do suspect 
A coward, who would burden the poor deuce 
With what ensues from his own slipperiness." 

We may suffer for our follies, but we may also 
profit by them. Let us refrain, above all, from 
the folly of seeking forgetfulness as an anodyne 
for the pangs which come with memories of the 
past. 

" If I drink oblivion of a day, 
So shorten I the stature of my soul." 

All experience is good, if only we know how to 
make use of it. Again we seem to hear the 
voice of Goethe. 

" The inspired prophet of sanity," this is what 
Mr. Trevelyan repeatedly calls our poet, happily 
quoting him to the effect that " our civilization 
is founded in common sense, and it is the first 
condition of sanity to believe it." This principle 
is what saves him from being an extremist, and 
preserves his balance in all sorts of intellectual 
contortions. It is the solid cornerstone of his 
faith ; for faith, as Mr. Trevelyan urges, is 
acceptance as well as hope — acceptance of the 
unalterable laws of nature as science reveals 
them, no less than hope of a better future for 
the race, a future to be realized by the applica- 
tion of man's intelligence to the hard conditions 
under which he lives. Mr. Meredith will have 
none of the old antithesis between faith and 
reason, for he sees the credo quia impossihile 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



195 



doctrine to be the nonsense that it is. There is 
legitimate scope for faith, no doubt, beyond the 
borderland of the realms which science has re- 
claimed by conquest ; but only a pseudo-faith 
will flout the dictates of reason, or seek to but- 
tress its soaring spires with the fantastic sup- 
ports of the unregulated imagination. Mean- 
while, beset by many dangers, and far from 
certain of its goal, life has to be lived, and we 
must adopt some sort of attitude toward it. Mr. 
Meredith's attitude is thus described in pictur- 
esque metaphor by this his latest critic : 

" A wary but a cheerful and kindly Odysseus, he 
steers us, ' compact of what we are, between the ascetic 
rocks and the sensual whirlpools ' ; he can listen unboimd 
to every song of the Sirens, enraptured, but resolute by 
the rudder ; and the one-eyed Polyphemus of despair is 
left cheated and shouting after the white track of his 
departing vessel."

ments of philosophers, and it is rather astonishing 
to note the variety of their views as to the root 
ideas or essential facts of the universe. It might 
be worth while to apply their methods to Fiction, 
and, without any pretense at philosophic accxiracy, 
try to draw out the basic facts on which literature 
is founded, — stop the kaleidoscope, as it were, and 
examine the few scraps of human experience out 
of which the colored confusion of fictional life is 
woven. 

The first root idea of Fiction, then, is Identity. 
Of course personality, in the wider sense, is a pre- 
dicate of everything in literature, from the lyrist's 
strain of passion to the clashing figures of the 
dramatist or the more complex web of the narra- 
tive artist. All that happens must happen to or 
be caused by personality. But it is a more con- 
fined idea of personality — the Me as opposed to the 
Not-Me — which I refer to as Identity. Literature 
dallies with this fact in a hundred forms. 

Take the idea of twins, or what might be called 
divided personality. From Plautus to Shakespeare 
and Molifere, and down the line, this idea has been 
a most prolific som-ce of plot and situation. The 
double or echoing personality is nature's variant on 
the twin theme. Classic literatiu-e does not deal 
largely with such creations, but in the folk-poetry 
and wonder-fiction of the Middle Ages they are 
common enough. Spenser's Duessa is a false double 
of Una. Dickens's " Tale of Two Cities " and Dr. 
Hale's "My Double and How He Undid Me" are 
two modern instances of the use of this theme. Then 
there is the idea of a double identity of the Soul — 
of a shadow character capable of being projected, 
usually to plague the real one. Calderon's Embozado, 



Poe's William Wilson, Stevenson's Dr. Jeykll and 
Mr. Hyde, are embodiments of this thought. 

A second phase of this root idea is the confusion 
of personality. This is identity in disguise — as in 
acting, in girls masquerading a« men, in people 
assuming some other character than their own. 
This set of situations has been a veritable gold- 
mine to poets and romance writers. Charles Lamb 
complained that every one of Shakespeare's come- 
dies has a girl-boy in it. But princesses attired as 
pages trip up and down the whole field of romance. 
Tasso and Spenser have women warriors who are 
only revealed when some imlucky stroke of a sword 
smites their helmets apart and lets the long hair 
ripple down. Edgar in " King Lear," and Hugo's 
Tribonlet, are instances of disguise of character. 
The little play of " David Grarrick " gives an ex- 
ample of a person acting a part, and in Peg Wof- 
fington we have a character assuming to be her 
own portrait. 

Again, there is the transference of personality, 
as in the legends of the Were Wolf, or in many 
witch-stories where those possessed persons turn 
themselves into cats or dogs. Reincarnation would 
seem to be a magnificent basis for plot, but I can 
recall only a few instances of it in literature — 
Poe's " Tale of the Ragged Mountains," and " Phra 
the Phoenician " of the younger Arnold among them. 
Even the epics and dramas of India deal but spar- 
ingly with this idea. 

The domination of personality, as in hypnotism, 
witchcraft, dealings with the devil, have gfiven a 
good many situations to literature. There is Joseph 
Balselmo's relations to his mistress in Dumas, the 
trances of Trilby, the ballad-stories of the revenges 
of witches on lovers or rivals, Faust's subjugation 
to Mephistopheles. The imposition of a false j)er- 
sonality is a great source of comic plot, as in the 
story of " The Sleeper Awakened " in " The Arabian 
Nights," the Christopher Sly framework of "The 
Taming of the Shrew," and Moli^re's " M^decin 
Malgrd Lui." In all these situations, the character 
changes, or seems to change, while the world i-emains 
the same. Essentially of the same kind are the plots 
which turn on rejuvenations — obtaining the Elixir 
of Youth, drinking of the Fountain of Life, etc. 

The suspension of personaUty, as in a long sleep, 
has given rise to some good plots. There are " The 
Seven Sleepers of Ephesus " and " Rip Van Winkle." 
Here the character remains the same, whUe the 
world changes about it. Everlasting identity, as in 
the legend of the Wandering Jew, has exercised a 
deep spell on the hiunan mind, but it is not capable 
of much variation, though something of the same 
nature is bodied forth in the popular imaginations 
which describe Babarossa sitting clothed and armed 
in his rock cave ready to issue forth when his time 
shall come again, or King Arthur in his temporary 
sleep at Avillion. 

The modern theories of heredity have brought 
forward the inheritance of character as a literary

subject. Ibsen's " Ghosts " is the most pronounced 
embodiment of these theories. 

It may almost be said that every German novel is 
an educational treatise. Since " Wilhelm Meister " 
set the fashion, the Germans have hardly been able 
to write a novel which does not deal with the devel- 
opment of a character by training and environment. 
This subject is to them what the eternal theme of 
three — husband, wife, and lover — is to the French. 
Yet they derive it from the French, through Rousseau 
and our old friend Telemachus. 

Surprises, detections, unravelments, recognitions, 
revelations, — all these have to do with identity. 
Coleridge said that the Qi^dipus of Sophocles and 
" Tom Jones " had the best plots in the world. This 
is hardly so, but they both deal with revelations 
of identity. So do Poe's detective stories, and the 
superb novels of Wilkie Collins. Mr. Aldrich has 
patented a plot of surprise which is mighty effective. 

There are more kinds of disguises of personality 
than one. There is the material disguise, as where 
Odysseus returns to Penelope's court in the rags of 
a beggar ; or where Rosalind sallies forth in doublet 
and hose. And there is the mental disgvuse of 
drunkenness or madness. Herakles is hilariously 
disguised in the Alcestis of Euripides. Falstaff goes 
through life in a disguise of sack, a dozen different 
characters peeping forth through the thick fumes 
that envelop him. The two most magnificent mad- 
men in literature are Don Quixote and King Lear, 
and it is a question whether they are not both of 
them more inspired than crazy. Intoxication is a 
kind of cheap exaltation, and the primitive races 
all consider a madman inspired. Personality at 
meridian, personality inspired, personality as genius, 
ought to be a fascinating theme for literature, and 
I cannot recall that anybody has made much of a 
fist at it. Chateaubriand and Lamartine and George 
Sand were always attempting it, but their geniuses 
are weak-kneed and boneless creations. Poe has 
hints of this theme throughout his work, and in 
one or two of his stories quite hits the mark. A 
recent novel, "The Divine Fire," does very well 
indeed. In real life, the inspirer of personality 
often takes a supposedly outward form. Numa has 
his Egeria, Socrates his Daemon. The idea of an 
Egeria has taken firm root in the poetic mind, and 
it has been embodied for all time in Dante and 
Petrarch. The hero of one of Du Maurier's novels 
has an Egeria in a lady from Mars who dictates 
novels and poems to him in his sleep. One cannot 
say anything about the novels, but the poetry is 
atrocious. 

Character's collusion with the Not-Me, or Person- 
ality vs. The World, is the root idea of many of the 
noblest masterpieces of literature. Wherever a noble 
dreamer or enthusiast shatters himself against the 
inexorable fact, this idea is at work. Prometheus, 
Hamlet, the Marquis of Posa, Brand, Shelley's cloud 
characters, Hugo's Galley Slave, — these and myriad 
other beings of the same blood testify to its power. 
Personality misunderstood, loneliness, misanthropy,- 



are other forms of the same theme. Shakespeare's 
Timon, Moliere's Alceste, Byron's Childe Harold, 
are figures of a kindred group. Personality in 
antithesis is a minor variant of this last type. Don 
Quixote and Sancho, Walter Shandy and My Uncle 
Toby, give in little the idea of the heroic struggler 
and the resisting world. 

Evil identity, bad intellect dominant, is another 
type, and, after the group I have just named, is 
probably the most prominent in literature. lago, 
Richard, Don Juan, Mej^histopheles, — one could 
call an endless roll of these Satanic stars. Milton's 
Lucifer is on the whole too noble to be named with 
them. He is a great and rebellious son of God, and 
belongs rather with Prometheus and Hamlet. 

Animal identity — or, rather, the casting of human 
personalities into animals — has been a great cause 
of good writing, from ^sop and the Indian origi- 
nals of Pilpay tlirough the French beast-epic of 
Reynard the Fox, down to the stories of Uncle 
Remus. • I do not know whether the reverse has 
ever been distinctively and definitely tried, — I mean 
the clothing of beasts in men's skins. Of course 
such a process is glimpsed at in almost every work 
of literature. We always have men resembling 
lions or wolves or foxes, and women who carry with 
them the stamp of tigers or antelopes or snakes. 

Lastly, we have intellect identifying itself with 
nature — the human personality projecting itself into 
the world. This is the main source of mythologies 
and folk-lores. In older literature this projection 
was a definite one ; the god or nymph or naiad sat 
visibly enthi'oned on cloud or tree or wave. Modern 
landscapists, either in words or colors, have changed 
all that. They give a sense of identity or personality 
to ocean or desert or storm, but they do not embody 
these aspects of nature in human form. Theirs is 
a deeper and subtler manner of myth-making, but it 
is also more vague and uncertain. The poet or 
painter who uses it asks a great deal from the reader 
or spectator. This difference in method probably 
explains the preponderance of landscape in modern 
literature and our apparent greater enjoyment of 
natural aspects. The Greeks loved nature as much 
as we do, studied its appearances as deeply ; but 
when they brought it into art, they dealt with it in 
brief : their mythological figures were hieroglyphics 
— a sort of shorthand which saved a great deal of 
writing. We have to use a cloud of words to give 
the same impressions. 

I have probably not touched upon half the ways 
in which the mysterious thing I have called Identity 
enters into Fiction. And 1 have not even named 
the other roots of Fiction whose innumerable runners 
send vigor and virtue up to build the great trunk 
and the commingling intricacies of branch and foli- 
age of the tree of Literature. As I conceive it, 
these other roots are Hunger, Love, and Death. 
Anyone who desires can easily take the clue of one 
or the other of these essential ideas and trace it 
through the maze of Fiction.

COMMUNICA TION. 



ANOTHER PHASE OF THE "SPELLING REFORM." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Your recent editorial article, with which I am in 
hearty sympathy, regarding the latest move in the " re- 
form " of our spelling, omits one phase which to my 
mind deserves attention. Careful examination of the 
three himdred words recently recommended by the 
President for modification shows that some of them, 
such as "homonym," are already in common use by 
practically everyone ; a sixth of the words are technical 
or else rarely needed in the vocabulary of a man of 
ordinary culture; seventy-four merely insist on -t for 
-ed to indicate the past tense of verbs, an extension of 
a change already accepted through custom in many 
similar words; and a majority of the remainder suffer 
such changes as are insignificant in proportion to the 
blare of the announcements. 

But together with these " reformed " words, at least 
some of which everyone already uses, are for some 
reason included a number of words which, besides being 
distasteful to many — am I not safe in saying to most? 
— people who have respect and feeling for the lan- 
guage, are also illogical and mischievously absurd. " If," 
the argiiment seems to run, " you spell ' dactyl,' then 
you mvDit use ' thru,' ' tho,' ' thoro,' and all the entire 
list." This is " advancing abreast of popular sentiment " 
with a vengeance! Usage in America probably has 
already decisively chosen " honor," leaving to a few 
old-fashioned folk, and for peculiar shades of meaning, 
the vowel that still is pronoxmced in the last syllable; 
but the monstrosities ' thru,' ' tho,' and their kin, are 
abortions from the mind of the zealot. I never knew a 
person to use these spellings unless he first had been 
indoctrinated by a missionary. I have failed in this 
part of the world, too, to find any " popular sentiment " 
demanding the abbreviated, or any other, spelling for 
" hematin," "colter," "eponym," and "etiology." Those 
who are so acute as to have discovered this " popular 
sentiment " should also have discovered that Professor 
Lounsbury and Professor Skeat are not the only author- 
ities on the English language : other men, just as learned, 
just as conscientious, and just as sincere, are opposed 
to all this movement, which by some is irreverently 
called meddling. Where specialists and lovers of the 
language have not yet found an agreement, it would at 
least be modest for mere money and power delegated 
for other purposes to refrain awhile from casting their 
" slight weight " with either side. 

Everyone who has attended a meeting of spelling 
reformers has found it inspired and conducted by men 
who show every evidence of being consecrated to a 
" cause." They speak of this and that " step in the 
programme " — may I indulge in the luxury of a final 
-me once more before it is forbidden? — as if every 
move were advancing a definite and thoroughly conceived 
propaganda. This seems to begin with the fostering of a 
movement to secure a uniform system of phonetic nota- 
tion for dictionaries and language books, which, every- 
one agrees, is much to be desired. But so far, after 
many attempts and years of study and discussion, the 
learned societies of this country and of England have 
not been able to invent such a system that is generally 
acceptable. To secure this system of phonetic notation 
seems to be the first step, the second — but by what 



logic it appeareth not — being the " reforming " of the 
much-discussed twelve words. How far the propa- 
gandists see, and plan to lead us, apparently is disclosed 
more and more each year. " Accept this insignificant 
change," they plead or urge or bully, — for, by another 
inexplicable connection, to withstand is to be denounced 
as an enemy to progress and democracy of all kinds; 
but accept them on your peril. Agree to drop the " e " 
in " abridgement," and you are heralded as a reformer; 
moreover, like the good-natured chess-player, by accom- 
modatingly yielding a pawn you find yourself committed 
to a well-planned campaign — I see they have so far left 
us the "g" — that ends only with the loss of the game. 
So long as this is the attitude of the enemy — enemy 
not of us personally but of the venerable mother-tongue 
— we must not only admit, but even emphasize, that, 
as the " reformers " have asserted, there is a " moral 
question " at stake in the matter, but it is not perhaps 
the one they at the time had in mind.

Spelling reformers, and others, may like to examine 
this beginning and end of a letter from Anna, Countess 
of Argyll, to her friend the Countess of Athole, as 
printed in " Pryings Among Private Papers," a recent 
ingenious compilation by the author of " The Life of Sir 
Kenelm Digby." Except the curious spelling of sweet 
at the end, the letter contains nothing to puzzle a mod- 
em reader. It was written at Inverary, Sept. 23, 1675. 
" Dear Madam, I was verie sobsitus all this sumer to 
know how your Ladyship & all yours war, & how you 
keep your health, & was one going to send in to yon bot 
I was hindered by my ouen sikness, & my Lord sent me 
word you was well, which was verie exceptabell to me: 
my dear Lord has been in the condision of a soger this 
fortnight. . . . Pray madam giue me line to present 
my humbell seruic to your Lord & I am my Lady Jan's 
sereuent & my suit Lady Emilia." 

As 18 USUAL with such compilations, there is a good 
deal of rather dull fooling in Mr. Marshall Brown's 
" Humor of Bulls and Blunders " (Small, Maynard & 
Co.), but the book has smiles enough iu its keeping to be 
worth looking over. The man who was asked his Christian 
name, and replied " Solomon Isaacs," is an old acquain- 
tance, but it is amusing to remember that an innocent 
New York reporter once addressed the same question 
to Dr. Wu Ting-fang, much to the delight of that ap- 
preciative oriental. The following may be old, but it is 
perennially provocative of mirth: "Wanted — a com- 
petent person to undertake the sale of a new medicine 
that ^-lU prove highly lucrative to the undertaker." 
And we always read with fresh joy of the rural justice 
who thus addressed a convicted marauder: "Prisoner, 
a boimtiful Providence has endowed you with health 
and strength, iastead of which you go about the country 
stealing hens." Schoolboy blunders are multitudinous, 
but we have never seen a better one than the statement 
that " Puritans were people who thought the church 
ought to be putrefied," which we offer to Mr. Brown 
for his next edition. We will also supply the section of 
mixed metaphors with Joseph Cook's original remark 
that " many a materialistic armada has been wrecked 
on the hungry tuaks of self-contradiction."

Hans Breitmann ' and ' Romany Rye.»* 



Three and a half years ago, after a long life 
spent in going to and fro in the earth, in meeting 
with all sorts of adventures, in making all sorts 
of acquaintances, in searching after divers kinds 
of rare and out-of-the-way knowledge, and in 
writing more than half a hundred books on 
widely varied subjects, not to mention a midti- 
tude of shorter pieces, Charles Godfrey Leland 
set out on the greatest of all conceivable adven- 
tures, the "Adventure into the Unknown." 
But though he has departed — vanished into the 
" Ewigkeit "of his own " Hans Breitmann 's 
Barty " — he has left not a few warm friends 
and admirers to keep his memory green ; among 
whom attention is now called to his niece, Mrs. 
Elizabeth Robins Pennell, by the appearance of 
her two- volume biography of her uncle. Having 
enjoyed during her adult years a very close 
intimacy with this remarkable man, Mrs. Pen- 
nell writes with a rare understanding of his 
character and genius, and seems to have pre- 
sented us with the true Leland, so far as one 
mortal may penetrate the mystery of another's 
individuality. The " Memoirs," written by Mr. 
Leland himself, and bringing his life down to 
1870, have served as an important source of 
information, supplemented by private papers 
left to her at his death, and by letters to and 
from a great number of persons in different 
parts of the world. Thus, not a little of the 
charm of Leland's personality breathes in the 
pages of his biography ; and though the work 
cannot rival or displace the " Memoirs," it is a 
worthy tribute and will be received as the defi- 
nitive and authoritative life of this highly inter- 
esting and attractive man. 

Mrs. PenneU is imbued with something of 
her late xmcle's love of Gypsy lore, witchcraft, 
sorcery, demonology, popular superstitions, 
tinkers'- talk, fortune -telling, crystal-gazing, 
voodooism, and kindred branches of unpolite 
learning. In fact, she has given more space to 
these matters, to the " Romany " side of her 
hero, than most readers woidd have demanded. 
But let them thank her for having conscien- 
tiously translated the Romany talk, what there 
is of it. Of " Shelta," or tinkers '-talk, we learn 
from her pages just enough to awaken curiosity. 
Her almost invariable reference to her imcle as

ton, Mifflin & Co. 



" the Rye," even for the years preceding his 
rather late acquisition of Romany, seems not 
always quite appropriate. A preliminary defi- 
nition of the word as meaning, among Gypsies, 
a superior person or gentleman, might have been 
welcome to the uninitiated. A quotation from 
Mrs. Pennell 's opening pages is here in place. 

" His interests were wide and varied, and only a 
writer as many-sided could do full justice to all his 
intellectual adventures. There were so many subjects 
he mastered of which my knowledge — if I have any — 
is slight, that I can only hope to show what they were 
to him and how he was influenced by them. One other 
explanation I ought to make. If I have less knowledge 
than my task demands, on the other hand, no such fault 
can be found with the sympathy and affection I bring to 
it. I had a friend in my uncle — or in < The Rye,' as 
I must be allowed to call him. For it was the name 
by which I knew him best, — not knowing him really 
until he had become ' The Rye ' for every Gypsy on 
the English roads and every Gypsy scholar the world 
over." 

To those who think of Leland chiefly as the 
author of the " Breitmann" jingles, his many- 
sidedness must come as a surprise. He himself 
was displeased and hurt that so many knew him 
only as " Hans Breitmann," whereas the best of 
his energies had been most generously spent in 
the cause of industrial art education. Some of 
the book-titles from the four-page bibliography 
at the end of Mrs. Pennell 's work may serve to 
illustrate the variety of Leland's interests and 
pursuits. His first book was on " The Poetry 
and Mystery of Dreams." Later in the list 
come " The Book of Copperheads," "Legends 
of the Birds," " The Music Lesson of Confucius," 
"The Egyptian Sketch-Book," "The Minor 
Arts," " A Dictionary of Slang," " A Manual 
of Mending and Repairing," " Have You a 
Strong Will ? " and last of all, "The Alternate 
Sex." The very variety of his tastes was against 
his producing any one work of lasting renown. 
Life to him was a joyous journey through 
wonderland, mystery lurking behind every way- 
side hedge and strange adventure awaiting one 
beyond the brow of every hill. Through it all, 
his appetite for work was insatiable. Even 
reading gave him little pleasure except as sug- 
gesting themes for books and articles. Those 
who had not this love of hard work were to him 
incomprehensible creatures. He failed to per- 
ceive how fortunate it is for the workers that 
so many are content to be drones. If all were 
writers, where would be the readers for so 
many books ? 

Carl Schurz's impressions of a famous actress 
have recently appeared in print. Leland's im- 
pressions of the same actress are no less worth

publishing. He found in Rachel more of art 
than of " pure sympathetic genius." 

" Sometimes there is so much art that the multitude 
believe it is genius. Both Rachel and Bernhardt were, 
like all Jews, immensely talented and quick to feel what 
took with the public; but though great as actresses, 
they belonged to the second class. Read what Heine 
says of Rachel, how severely he blames her want of 
all sold; and yet as a Jew he would fain praise her. I 
saw Rachel for the first time in 1847. I was then 
twenty-four, and I never shall forget how, while I 
appreciated her mere skill and cleverness, I was, I may 
say, disgusted at her tricks of the stage and utter want 
of soul. Her great dodge was to work herself into a 
spasm of passion, and then in a second cast herself into 
a statuesque attitude of utter calm and exclaim in an 
icy voice, ' Monsieur,' or * Mon Seigneur.' And then 
all Paris, from Dumas down, went mad with applause ; 
but it was so transparently tricky that I could only 
laugh." 

In the French Revolution of 1848 the young 
Leland took an active part. From a letter de- 
scribing scenes in Paris at that time, a lively 
passage calls for quotation. 

" Whack ! hurrah ! guns and drums, fusillades and 
barricades ! We dined under a Monarchy, supped 
under a Regency, went to sleep under a Provisional 
Grovernment, and woke imder a Republic — not to 
mention two hours when we had just no Government 
at all. . . . We had a Review with nearly 350,000 
soldiers the other day, and all Paris is overrun with 
penny papers, newsboys, and newswomen, who make 
such a row night and day that the city has become in- 
sufferable. . . . Every night at all the theatres the 
entire audience sing the songs of the revolution and 
amuse themselves in a free and easy way which would 
do honour to the Bowery, so that even I — quiet and 
sober citizen — have been inspired with their enthusi- 
asm. I really begin to think of addressing the opera 
audience on the American Constitution — the price of 
provisions — electromagnetism — and matters and 
things in general. You will find the report of the 
speech the next day after never in the columns of the 
« Constitutionnel ' — Vive la bagatelle ! " 

Some of Leland 's pereonal and literary lik- 
ings and dislikings, especially the latter, are 
amusingly characteristic of the man. In a new 
poem of Swinburne's he finds " more of the 
strength of poison than of muscle." Of Emer- 
son, whom he early met at an " Atlantic " 
Saturday dinner, he says in his impublished 
memoranda : 

" Emerson dabbled with mysticism and paddled in 
metempsychosis, and shirked pantheism, as did Carlyle, 
while using it as a garment, and exalted Goethe; but 
would have died of blushes and sunk into his boots be- 
fore Greek fleshliness. So he once said to me, and that 
rather rudely and uncalled for, that ' Heine was a quack 
and charlatan in literature,' which, considering that I 
had translated the two principal works of Heine, I 
thought very unkind." 

Of Walt Whitman, whom he admired in gen- 
eral, Leland has a good story to teU. 



« When my book on the Gypsies appeared, I, knowing 
that it would interest him, gave him a copy, in which 
1 had written a short complimentary poem, and, mindful 
of the great and warm gratitude which he had declared 
regarding my brother Henry, I asked him if he would 
not write for me a few original verses, though it were 
only a couplet, in the copy of ' Leaves of Grass ' which 
he had sent to my brother. His reply was a refusal, at 
which I should not have felt hurt, had it been gently 
worded or civilly evasive, but his reply was to the effect 
that he never did anything of the kind except for money. 
His exact words then were, < Sometimes when a fellow 
says to me, " Walt, here 's ten or five dollars — write 
me a poem for it," I do so.' And then seeing a look of 
disappointment or astonishment in my face, he added: 
< But I will give you my photograph and autograph,' 
which he did." 

Matthew Arnold is called by Leland "the 
Prince of Prigs." A stem encounter with Car- 
lyle is graphically reproduced. One would like 
to know Leland's opinion of Sir Richard Bur- 
ton. Why did they never meet and become 
fast friends ? Or did they meet and fail to hit 
it off ? The two have points of striking simi- 
larity. As was once said of Leland — to quote 
Mrs. Pennell's version of the remark — he had 
" something of Burton in his delight in natural 
himian beings other than the ordinary frock- 
coated, tall-hatted, high-heeled English types." 
And yet, Romany enthusiasts though they both 
were, they seem never to have cooperated in 
their researches in Gypsy lore. 

The too short-livecl Rabelais Club, of which 
Leland was the chief founder, is now remem- 
bered by few. But his boyish enthusiasm for 
whatever he undertook, and at whatever time 
of life, is a perennially joyfid thing to contem- 
plate. He exclaims in a letter : 

" I want the Rabelais to corruscate — whizz, blaze 
and sparkle, fulminate and bang. It must be great and 
wise and good, ripstavering, bland, dynamitic, gentle, 
awful, tender, and tremidous." 

The reader, if critically inclined, wiU note 
Leland's divided allegiance between " Gypsy " 
and " Gipsy " — which may partly explain why 
we fail to find Burton among his intimate 
friends, as Burton cherished a pet abhorrence 
for the spelling " Gipsy," and for all who gave 
it their covmtenance. The letter of Leland's 
beginning " My Dear Walter," and printed with 
letters to Besant, though, as Mrs. Pennell says, 
manifestly written to some other Walter, may 
have been addressed to the writer's friend Pol- 
lock ; at any rate, the suggestion is here offered 
in passing. 

The publishing of memoirs and letters has 
gone to great lengths in these latter days ; but

panion and supplement to the " Memoirs " of 
1893, it helps to furnish a full-length portrait 
of an unusually interesting man. The many 
portraits and other illustrations — especially the 
facsimiles of Leland's illustrated letters — scat- 
tered through the volumes add much to the 
book's attractiveness. The two portraits of 
Leland himself, one taken in Philadelphia in 
his prime, the other shortly before his death in 
Italy, show us unmistakably the same man, and 
yet so strangely different ! The 36-page index, 
and the bibliography already mentioned, are 
manifestly the products of scholarly care and 
painstaking thoroughness.

Two Famous Exglish Rivers.* 



The charm of landscape often lies less in the 
actual view than in its associations. The Thames 
and the Tiber seem more beautiful than similar 
streams with lesser histories. England's Avon 
is a pretty river, but in itself is not much prettier 
than Michigan's Kalamazoo, which in parts it 
resembles not a little. 

Taking up the companion volumes, " In 
Thamesland " and " The Idyllic Avon," we know 
that we shall meet with poetry, history, and 
romance in their enticing pages. The natural 
scenery is indeed beautiful, as the copiously 
illustrated pages of both books prove ; but after 
all, what is the actual compared with our dreams ? 
What visions are conjured by the mere utter- 
ance of these two historic names — visions of 
that wonderful past in which aU the men were 
brave and all the women fair ! These square 
walled-in gardens — how can we do otherwise 
than fill them with pretty ladies in high-waisted 
bef rilled frocks, with courtly-mannered men in 
brightly colored coats and gaily flowered waist- 
coats, knee-breeches, and periwigs ? These velvety 
lawns of vivid green — who shall explain their 
secret? Only the English gardener knows it, 
and his explanation is far from poetical : "We 
mows 'em and we roUs 'em for a thousand years, 
and the rain on 'em does the rest." 

It is impossible to think of England without 
its principal river. The Thames has done and

seen big things, and the phases of its life are 
many. To know it well is to know a great deal 
of English history. It laves and cuts in twain 
the burliest city in all the world ; it bears a vast 
commerce from London to the sea ; years agone, 
kings and princes and the fairest women in the 
land rode upon its tide in functions of state or 
in the idle pose of pleasure. Take almost any 
view-point — for example, Richmond Terrace, 
only a few miles from the great city — and we 
behold no end of interesting things. 

" Elizabeth and Leicester once enjoyed the rapture 
of the same beautiful landscape that enchants us to-day. 
To the left, and below the terrace of the Star and 
Garter, a modern hostelry which occupies the site of the 
structure where Queen Elizabeth died, one sees White 
Lodge, sometime the residence of the Prince of Wales, 
of the Battenbergs, and of other members of the royal 
household. Beyond is Ham House on the banks of the 
Thames in the dull little village of Petersham, where 
Charles I. took refuge in his flight. On the opposite, 
the north bank. Pope's villa peeps out its ruddy turrets 
from a dark green foliate mass. Weir House and Ted- 
dington lock, a pretty islet and backwater, and the dis- 
tant towers of Windsor, glint in the afternoon sun. 
Winding through the valley, stretching its silvern width 
before us, flows the merry river, its burthen of pleasure 
craft and flanneled fuss and play ; a scene of everchang- 
ing loveliness, of perfect tranquillity on a summer's day. 
Behind us is old London, and all around the ancient 
town of Richmond, the fashionable resort of the great 
courtiers and fine ladies of many splendid days ago." 

Or, let us pause in our Thames journey at 
Oxford. Let us make the rounds of its ivied 
college buildings in the companionship of some 
old and enthusiastic alumnus; let us absorb 
his affection for his alma mater and his joy in 
everything, from Gothic facade to a turf six 
hundred years old, and we shall not care to 
dispute with him that Oxford is the stateliest 
intellectual monument in the world. The beau- 
tiful Saxon, early Norman, English, Gothic, 
and Italian structures have been faithfully pre- 
served through all necessary alterations and 
additions ; they still glorify her past, while 
serving to make the Oxford of to-day larger 
and grander than before. 

At Oxford, as elsewhere, one continues to 
feel the powerful personality of that great ruler 
and wonderful woman, Queen Elizabeth. Ox- 
ford, and indeed all England, were in bad plight 
when Elizabeth ascended the throne. But her 
advent heralded a new and glorious era. She 
encouraged learning by choosing for her ser- 
vice eminent and hopeful students like Sir 
Thomas Bodley. The Bodleian Library, oldest 
public library in Europe, is his monument. He 
was followed by a long line of eminent scholars, 
each in his turn carrying on the University's

prosperity. Archbishop Laud re-cast its stat- 
utes and built Convocation House, Oxford's 
Parliament. The city became in spirit the 
Royalist capital of England, and later, during 
the civil war, an actual court and fortress. 

Memories such as these are aroused through- 
out the hundred and forty-eight miles of this 
journey down the Thames, from its source near 
Crickdale to Putney Bridge in London. But 
after aU, in the opinion of our guide through 
Thamesland, the dominating fact of the Thames, 
dwarfing its natural beauty and unrivalled his- 
torical associations, is that London stands upon 
its shores — majestic London, that world within 
a world, not only appalling in extent, but with 
an antiquity and a history such that no street 
can be found in it of which something of interest 
has not been recorded. Yet a first view of the 
Thames from a London window or street is quite 
likely to be a disappointment. It seems scarcely 
a river at all, but a smooth-banked park rivu- 
let, with a picturesque swagger, a smug compla- 
cency, tj^ically British. But there are times 
and places fit for first meetings with localities, 
as with persons. Walk half-way across TTest- 
minster Bridge, and turn to look back on the 
view of the river embracing the noble Houses 
of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and the 
Victoria Embankment with its Somerset House 
and Cleopatra's Needle. Thus Wordsworth saw^ 
it at four o'clock in the morning, from the top 
of a coach on its way to Dover ; and here his 
magnificent lines will start into memory : 
" Earth has not anything to show more fair: 

Never did sun more beautifully steep 
In his first splendour, vaUey, rock, or hill; 
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep ! 
The river glideth at his own sweet will; 
Dear God ! the very houses seem asleep; 
And all that mighty heart is lying still." 

Compared with the Thames, the Avon is an 
insignificant river, yet to many it is dearer than 
the larger stream. If Queen Elizabeth is the 
dominating personality' of the Thames story, the 
Avon too has its hero — a certain poet and actor 
whom Elizabeth sometimes siunmoned to her 
court to amuse her with his latest play. The 
thought of Avon is linked so inseparably with 
thoughts of Shakespeare and Stratford, that in 
taking up " The Idyllic Avon " it is a surprise 
to find only about forty of its two hundred and 
sixty pages given to these matters. The Avon 
has fifty miles to travel after it leaves Stratford, 
before it empties into the Severn. Even at 
Welford, only five miles below Stratford, a resi- 
dent, we are told, being questioned as to his 



knowledge of Shakespeare, replied : " Oh, ah ! 
I 've heard on him ; he 's a bloke as keeps a 
museum at Stratford." 

For the local people, Stratford is not so much 
the town of Shakespeare as the market-town of 
Stratford. There are numbers of persons living 
within a dozen miles of it who have never been 
there, and when they do go it wiU be to buy, 
sell, receive, or deliver something, or to hire a 
servant or be hired, and not to worship at the 
shrine of the great poet. The town was there 
before Shakespeare, and it maintains locally a 
primal importance to which the fact of its having 
supplied the circumstances into which Shake- 
speare was bom is accidental. At the present 
time, Stratford does not differ materially from 
other market-towns in central England, except- 
ing that on account of its many visitors it is a 
little more smartly kept. And, since so much 
has been written about Shakespeare and Strat- 
ford by abler pens than Air. Grarrett's, it is 
perhaps quite as weU that his trip on the Avon 
deals rather with idyls of other towns and 
peoples. 

The voyage begins near the mouth of the 
Severn, at Tewkesbury. This furnishes occa- 
sion for a fairly good resume of the last battle 
in the Wars of the Roses ; also for a history of 
Tewkesbury Abbey, and some very charming 
pictures of it. At Pershore Town is another 
Abbey, whose bells ring a chime at the hour, 
and after the stroke of every third hour a tune 
— the air of one or another of fourteen old 
songs or hymns ; they repeat the melody four 
times, so that some minutes of the next hour 
have passed before they cease. The ostler at 
the inn or the man in the street unconsciously 
whistles the tune of the day as he goes about 
his business. Besides its chimes, Pershore is 
noted for its fruit, especially its plums. 

" There are many plantations of plum-trees in and 
about the town, and the prosperity of the place greatly 
varies with a good or bad plum year. They say that if 
you meet a Pershore man in a good gardening season 
and ask him where he comes from, he replies, * Pershore ; 
where 'd you think ? ' But to the same question, when 
the season is a bad one, he grumbles out the reply, 
* Pershore, — God help us !' ... In a place the size of 
Pershore everybody is supposed to know everybody 
else ; but such knowledge can, after all, be but partial, 
and the estimation one makes of another is probably in 
some cases mistaken, notwithstanding the great facilities 
afforded to everybody to discuss every other person's 
business. That is nothing, or nothing but very com- 
monplace; but what is something is the sunniness and 
simplicity of this little town, and the genial, friendly 
nature of its inhabitants." 

It is in pictures such as this — pictures of 



202 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



English country life, its simplicity and friend- 
liness, — that the book makes its strongest appeal 
to the reader. These are days in which it is well 
to be reminded that the essence of human life 
consists in things simple and commonplace, — 
the gathering in of the last sheaves of the har- 
vest, and the driving in of the plough into the 
stubbles ; the milking of kine and the feeding 
of pigs ; the picking of fruit and the digging up 
of potatoes ; — the homely primary duties of man . 
The eighty-seven illustrations from Mr. Gar- 
rett's own camera are charming, and the two 
maps are excellent. It is pathetic that a man 
who can make such good pictures and write 
pretty good prose should be tempted into mak- 
ing such very bad verse. There are about thirty 
" Songs and Ballads " scattered through the 
text, which we wotdd gladly pass over in silence. 
But since the author calls attention to them 
both on title-page and in preface, they cannot 
be ignored. Here is one, entitled " The Storm 
on the River." 

" Now the daylight 

Turns to greylight, 
And a cold gust sends a shiver 
Through the river reeds and rushes, and stirs the wait- 
ing trees; 

Clouds so dun, now 
Hide the sun, now 
There are rain-drops on the river, 
And the echo of the thunder rumbles loud along the 
breeze. 

" Be not sad, oh. 

For this shadow — 
Change of shine to showery weather; 
The cloud is needful to the earth, as to our life its pain; 
There's a warm rift 
In the storm-drift. 
Showing sun and cloud together. 
And the wasting of the river is replenished by the rain." 

But Mr. Garrett's temptation to " drop into 
poetry " on slight occasion should perhaps be 
forgiven for the sake of the book's merits in 
many respects. Moreover, it is a beautiful 
specimen of the publishing art, the cover de- 
sign — a view of the Stratford church where 
Shakespeare is buried — being as lovely as it is 
appropriate. ^^^ Benneson McMahan. 



" Wer Ist's ? Unsere Zeitgenossen " (Leipzig: Deg- 
ener — New York: Stechert) comes to us in its second 
annual issue. It is closely modelled upon the type of 
" Who 's Who in America," and contains about sixteen 
thousand biographies, which is approximately the num- 
ber included in the latest edition of our own similar 
work. A few American names are found in the list, but 
their selection has not been made upon any rational basis. 
A great variety of statistical and other information is 
given in the preliminary pages. 



The Story of our Great Declaration.* 

Significant of the thorough investigation and 
scholarly results characterizing modern Ameri- 
can historical composition is a volume of more 
than five hundred pages devoted to an intensive 
study of the Declaration of Independence. That 
one incident in the comprehensive annals of the 
nation's history should be given so much time 
and space in the hurrying present may appear 
over-refinement to the hasty traveller, but that 
the final word has been said on one topic will 
be a satisfaction to the sojourner in the land of 
letters. Other volumes devoted to this subject, 
notably those of Sanderson, Michaels, and Fried- 
enwald, have set forth the lives of the signers, 
the statements made in the document, and the 
picturesque elements of the occasion. This 
writer is concerned with collecting every scrap of 
information concerning the inception of the idea 
of "• Independency," the passing of the motion 
by Congress, the penning of the Declaration, 
and the reception of the action of Congress by 
the people of the States. It is one of those 
abnormal books in which the space devoted to 
notes is larger than that given to the text ; yet 
by placing the notes after the text, the attention 
of the reader is not imduly distracted. Another 
device likely to prove of benefit to investigators 
and students is the designation by an initial 
letter of the library or collection in which the 
document or book quoted was found. 

The growing sentiment for Independence is 
traced rapidly through Seventy-Four, the year 
" in which the people for the first time recog- 
nized that the cause of Boston was a common 
cause "; through Seventy-Five, " when war had 
become a reality," to the beginning of Seventy- 
Six. Subsequently, Independence itself is fol- 
lowed through the the initial steps and the 
postponement, through the drafting of the 
Declaration, and through the battle-royal be- 
tween pro- and anti-Independents in New York 
and Pennsylvania. The actual signing is next 
critically examined, and the public opinions of 
the action are collated. A chapter follows on 
the " fireworks," or celebrations throughout the 
States, with a final chapter on the later history 
of the engrossed copy of the Declaration and the 
various copies made by Jefferson for his friends. 

The author approaches with confidence the 
crux of whether or not the Declaration was 
signed generally on July 4, 1776. He analyzes 
the old dispute, and finds that Jefferson was 
mistaken In saying that aU members present

signed except Dickinson of Pennsylvania. He 
even ventures to impeach Jefferson's statement 
that his " notes " were made at the time, and 
thinks they were changed subsequently to prove 
his assertion. No doubt, as the author points 
out, this ancient dispute originated in a con- 
fusion between the signing of the original copy 
and the engrossed copy. 

One coidd wish that as much analysis and 
thorough investigation had been given to the 
many stories connected with the signing as 
related by Jared Sparks, by Sanderson, Lossing, 
and others, to determine whether they are 
authentic or apocryphal. The author passes 
over the " Ring, Grandpa, Ring" tradition, — 
no doubt one of the many historical fictions 
from Lippard, — being content to label it " im- 
probable." It woidd seem that Marshall woidd 
have chronicled the hubbub in the streets of 
Philadelphia if the bell had been rung. 

Perhaps the most interesting portion of the 
book is that devoted to the means taken to 
spread the Declaration through the various 
States in order that the patriot cause might 
have the benefit of it. On the Monday follow- 
ing its adoption on Thursday, it was read in the 
State House Yard at Philadelphia, and before the 
militia at Easton, Pennsylvania, and at Trenton, 
New Jersey. The following night, Princeton 
College was illuminated. The same evening, 
by Washington's orders, the Declaration was 
read to the troops in New York City, drawn up 
in the " Commons " where the City Hall now 
stands. On the 18th of July it was proclaimed 
from the State House balcony in Boston, and 
the same day at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 
Southward it was read at Williamsburg, Vir- 
ginia, and at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 
25th ; and at Savannah, Georgia, August 10. 
Amidst the rejoicings, the huzzas, the firing of 
cannon, and the drinking of toasts, the king's 
coat of arms was taken down from court rooms, 
cut from the front of stone buildings, and 
stripped from flags. Patriotic parents even 
baptized their children " Independence." 

Mr. Hazelton has preferred to send out his 
material in bullion rather than to coin it into 
currency. As a narrative it suffers in conse- 
quence, but it has the greater value for the stu- 
dent. Magazine writers and others who mould 
original material into popular forms are likely 
to draw largely on this work. Mention should 
be made of the photographic reproductions of 
the various drafts of the Declaration and kin- 
dred papers, which serve really to illustrate the 
text. Edwin E. Sparks. 



Mature Judgments on Xapoleow.* 



In reading the volume in the " Cambridge 
Modern History " which expresses the maturer 
judgment of English historical scholarship upon 
the work of Napoleon, one is reminded, by way 
of contrast, that a century ago Englishmen — 
even sympathizei's with the French Revolution 
like Wordsworth — failed to note any charac- 
teristic of the new regime except the absence of 
political liberty. General Bonaparte appeared 
to them an upstart tyrant, and the subservience 
of the French seemed odious. They ignored the 
positive elements of his work, which Lafayette, 
an equally ardent apostle of freedom, indicated 
so weU in a public letter without being vmf aitb- 
fid to his early ideals. This letter was written 
to General Bonaparte, to explain why Lafayette 
voted against the project of the consulship for 
life. In it he says : " We have seen since the 
18th Brumaire in the consular power a restor- 
atory dictatorship, which, under the auspices of 
your genius, has accomplished great things, — 
less great, however, than would be the restoration 
of liberty." It is the attitude of Lafayette, rather 
than that of Wordsworth, which is assumed in the 
volume on Napoleon in the " Cambridge Modem 
History. ' ' Its breadth of view is also emphasized 
by the association in the group of writers, with 
several of England's most distinguished histor- 
ians, of Continental scholars like Professor 
Pariset of the University of Nancy, Professor 
Guilland of Ziirich, General Keim and Dr. 
Pflugk-Harttung of Germany, and Professor 
Stschepkin of the University of Odessa. 

In the assignment of topics to their European 
associates, the editors of this important series 
have been especially happy. Professor Pariset 's 
description of the Consulate impresses one as a 
piece of work which could be written only by a 
man with a native's experience of the operation 
of French administrative machinery. Dealing 
with such matters is largely a question of pro- 
portion and emphasis. The foreign scholar, with 
his array of " sources," is often led to measure 
the importance of an institution by the number 
of coliunns filled by its provisions in the colleo- 
tion of laws. In Professor Pariset's treatment 
there is not much that is new, but the exact func- 
tion of such a body as the Council of State is 
better explained than is commonly the case. 
And this is not the only example which might 
be cited. Again, Professor Guilland studies the 
French policy toward the dependent states like

Switzerland, not primarily from its results in 
the rupture of the Pea«e of Amiens, but rather 
from its bearing upon the permanent well-being 
of the Swiss. Must it not be refreshing also to 
read a Russian's account of that much described 
episode, the retreat from Moscow? 

The division of the subject-matter into topics 
has been accomplished satisfactorily. How vast 
this subject-matter is, one realizes when one notes 
^he condensed treatment of important topics, 
althoilgh the volume contains nearly eight hun- 
dred pages up to the bibliographies. Each 
writer seems to have planned his work well in 
relation to other parts of the book. In a few 
instances, however, all that is said in various 
places upon a particular subject does not amount 
to a sufficiently complete statement of it. This 
18 true of the rupture of the Peace of Amiens. 
It is questionable whether, in his discussion of 
the Continental System, Dr. Rose should not 
have included an explanation of the consequences 
of the Embargo, instead of merely referring to 
the treatment of this subject in a previous vol- 
ume of the series. While depending upon one 
another in this way, the authors have not sacri- 
ficed their personal attitude. For example, in 
fiealing with the Copenhagen affair Dr. Rose 
writes as a sympathetic critic of the policy of 
Canning, but Mr. Wilson refers to the plan 
adopted and carried into such terrible effect in 
terms which would be expected from persons 
who regard the exigencies of naval strategy as 
superior to considerations of national honor or 
public right. 

Among the questions given an exceptionally 
clear treatment in the light of the results of 
recent investigation is the significance of Ville- 
neuve's failure in 1805. This appears in Mr. 
Wilson's chapter on " The Command of the Sea." 
He shows by a comparison of dates that before 
Napoleon knew that Villeneuve had sailed south- 
ward to Cadiz he had written, " The army is in 
full march " against Austria. Mr. Wilson re- 
marks : " In reality, it was Nelson's swift move- 
ments, the Austrian division in Napoleon's rear, 
and the hopeless unseaworthiness of the flotilla, 
that dictated the abandonment of ' the immense 
project ' " of an invasion of England. 

From Dr. Rose's treatment of the Continental 
System, it appears that his opinion has changed 
in regard to the aim of the British Orders in 
Council of November, 1807. In his book on 
the " Revolutionary and Napoleonic Era," pub- 
lished twelve years ago, he declared that " the 
chief aim of our Orders in Council " was " the 
monopoly of the ocean commerce of the world." 



In his biography of Napoleon he stiU speaks of 
them as ' ' harsh and high-handed. ' ' In the present 
volume his attitude is much more favorable to 
the British case. " The facilities," he argues, 
" granted to neutrals were clearly of such a kind 
as to disprove the charge that George III. 's 
government deliberately sought to ruin neutral 
conmierce. On the contrary, it sought to attract 
neutral ships to British harbors, but only on 
conditions which contravened Napoleon's de- 
crees. The aim clearly was not to ruin neutral 
commerce, but to make the Continental System 
odious to neutrals." 

In his discussion of Bonaparte's policy at the 
beginning of the Consulate, Professor Guilland 
ignores one or two elements of the situation. It 
is obvious that if the new government was not 
to share the discredit of the Directory it must 
recover the position guaranteed by the terms of 
the treaty of Campo Formio — the " natural 
limits " securely flanked by French domination 
in Holland and Italy. No magistrate, not even 
a Washington, could have persuaded the French 
in 1800 to give up the power they had enjoyed 
so recently. The " elevation of war into a sys- 
tem," to quote Professor Guilland 's words, may 
have been Napoleon's later policy ; but at this 
time, even if he were following his inclination, 
he was also attempting what was unavoidable. 
The most masterly handling of a complex diplo- 
matic situation is to be found in Dr. Ward's 
two chapters on the Congress of Vienna. 

The editors have not called their volume " The 
Napoleonic Era," or " The Consulate and the 
Empire," but simply " Napoleon." This implies 
that in reading the chapters there shall appear 
one after another the lines of a consistent por- 
trait, and that in this personality shall be found 
the real unity of the treatment. This promise 
is fulfilled. The outlines of the picture are 
peculiarly clear in the closing pages of Mr. 
Fisher's admirable chapter on St. Helena, in 
his reflections upon the significance of Napo- 
leon's work, and of the attitude of the peoples 
of England and of Europe toward him.

The prevailing interest in matters relating to the 
South American republics is shown not only in the de- 
scriptive articles regarding them in various magazines, 
but in forthcoming books as well. Prominent among 
these is a new work by Mr. Percy F. Martin, F.R.G.S., 
entitled " Through Five Republics of South America," 
the five being Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and 
Venezuela. The volume will contain valuable statistical 
tables, with pictures and maps, and will treat of the man- 
ners, customs, and life of the people, as well as the rail- 
way, financial, commercial, and sociological conditions.

Recext Americax Poetry.* 



Blank verse is the most difficult of English verge- 
forms, and we rarely find it worth while to illustrate 
the work of our minor poets by extracts of that de- 
scription. But we find in Mr. Robert Cameron 
Rogers's newvolume"The Rosary and Other Poems" 
a group of four classical idyls in blank verse that 
are distinctly out of the common, and that yield such 
lines as these spoken by " Blind Polyphemus." 

" And Zeus grants one delight ; — when day is gone, 
When night blinds all, my sight comes back to me ; 
And I can see, as last I saw, the day — 
The great blue, breathing deep — the black-ribbed slag 
That Titans flung from Etna's forge to cool 
Amid the breakers, and away, beyond, 
The coast of Italy. Again I see 
The hazy hills where graze my brothers' sheep. 
The olive trees that bow themselves and peer 
Down grassy gullies, and the timid joy 
Of almond trees in bloom. 

When morning comes 
The ewes unbidden crowd about my knees. 
And with blind hands grown gentler than of old 
I milk them one by one ; then pasturewards 
I follow them who one time followed me." 

There is a Landorian touch of divine simplicity about 
these new "Hellenics" which gives them a marked dis- 
tinction. But the talent of ]VIr. Rogersis for the most 
part lyrical, and a very charming talent it is. This 
last half of "A Riding Song" is a memorable strain. 

" Then ride, for dawn is swift and sure. 

And an ebb must always be ; 
The magic moon will but endure 

One hour more up from the sea. 
The gold of a year of sun 's too poor 

To buy that hour of me ! 

" Though it has no thread in the loom of the past, 

Though a futxire has been denied, 
Though I may not hold it, riding fast, 

And it die, die, die, as we ride ; 
The rim of the moon has touched at last. 

And here is the ttum of the tide.

" 0, never for me a moon shall rise 

To shine as this moon has shone. 
Like a bark aflame, hull-down, it lies, 

Like a spent flame sunk it has gone. 
To shine, where a haunted flood-tide cries 

To the coasts of Avalon." 

This lyric illustrates both the free swing of the poet's 
verse, and the out-door quality which is one of its 
chief characteristics. 

Mr. Dodd's volume, "A Modem Alchemist," 
opens with a suggestion that should be taken to 
heart by those readers who ever seek to find the 
singer in the song, and whose interest in verse par- 
takes more of personal curiosity than of literary 
appreciation. 

" Friend, if yon read, read wisely, nor believe 
Grief's name is graven here because I grieve, 
Nor when I sing love's passion deem that I 
ELave felt each worded rapture sigh for sigh ! 
Life I interpret as I may, but keep 
Myself a secret where all secrets sleep." 

By way of a supplement to this finger-post of warn- 
iag, we may quote " Love and the Poet." 

" A maiden loved him, wooed him with her eyes ; 
He felt their limpid blueness like a dream. 
So rhymed of love with a divine surprise ! 

Love (not the blue-eyed maiden) was his theme. 

" ' O luring lips ! ' he sang, who knew them not ; 
' O burning kisses ! ' But his soul was strong. 
Silent, aloof, a sentinel of thought, 

Dwelling a hermit on the heights of song." 

In this volume also, as in the one preceding, we 
note the Landorian inspiration, and this time it is 
expressly and gratefully acknowledged in these lines 
on " The Pentameron." 

" O breath of something from beyond these hills, 
Some higher heaven whence the essential sweetness 
Comes down to us imperfectly in gusts, 
Striking a faintness of pure ecstasy 
Through the minutest fibre of our beings ! 
Such breaths come seldom to the innocent. 
How seldom to the wordly ! and, alas. 
There are who have not known them, nor shall know. 
To me one full intoxicating pang, 
Whereat my spirit cried out for painful bliss. 
Thou hast sent down to me, O Landor, one 
For which I thank thee not in words but tears ! " 

Mr. Dodd has the command of tragic pathos, a qual- 
ity exhibited most remarkably, perhaps, in " What 
the Coroner Found," a poem that inevitably recalls 
Rossetti's "Jenny." We must quote two or three 
stanzas, although they suffer sadly by being wrenched 
from their context. 

" Dead — ' Nell ' is dead ; fraQ siren of the streets. 

Love-starved, with lips reddened to summon shame . . . 

To-morrow's tale is written. Vulturous sheets 
Which lend the fallen miserable fame 

Will mark the spot, counting the tale well told. 

But ' Nell ' is dead ; poor ' Nell ' was overbold. 

" She has forgotten pain ... I must go down 
To where she lies, and elbow past the men 
Who press about her staring at the gown 

Stained with new blood, go down to her . . . and then, 
O then perhaps I shall return and know 
Why life yields unto death. 'Tis better so.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



" 'Tis better so : death quiets life. This night 

So much the still face of a courtesan 
Has taught me, showing strangely calm and white 

Under its rouge, peaceful and strangely wan, 
As if tired into silence. Death, through her. 
Invokes the incense of a worshipper." 

There is stufp in these poems — deep thought and 
deep feeling. And conjoined with them is a delicacy 
of touch that shows the artist keeping the upper 
hand of his emotions. Let us close this review with 
the exquisite lines upon " The Debutante." 

" Her name 's not Amaryllis, though she seems 
To shepherd with her eyes a flock of dreams ; 

And yet, it may be, when their tale is told 
(Poor sheep, poor silly dream-sheep pastured far 
Along faint hills lit by a maiden star ! ) 

She will desert them for the Fleece of Gold." 

" Many Moods " was the title given to a volume 
o£ his poems by the late J. A. Symonds. '' Many 
Moods and Many Minds " is the caption under 
which Mr. Louis James Block has made his latest 
collection of miscellaneous pieces. Mr. Block has 
paid loyal devotion to the muse for many years, 
and the present volume exhibits him as a very 
thoughtful poet, with many forms of technical ex- 
pression at his command. It seems to us that he is 
best when his form is simplest, as these stanzas fi'om 
" In the Afternoon " may serve to illustrate. 

" Gifts have the gray hours brought, 
Gray hours of the afternoon. 
Soft lighted hours, whose sun 
Faces the lampless moon. 

" Not the wild blooms of youth. 
Not passion's golden flowers. 
But blossoms wan of hue, 

Plucked in life's gentler bowers. 

" Sweeter is rest and calm 

Than ecstasy's fierce pain, 
And sweeter this sad bliss 

Than all youth strove to gain. 

" The calm of twilight descends 
Unvexed of sunset, and gray. 
Star-crowned, and bringer of dreams, 
Day's shadow, dearer than day." 

As an example of Mr. Block's more stately meas- 
ures, we quote his fine sonnet on " The Arbitration 
Treaty." 

" Yet the world moves ; although the bitter Past 

Lingering enthroned demands to be obeyed ; 

Across the seas the nations war-arrayed 
Still stand at gaze, and hearken for the vast 
And harsh call unto strife, the thunderous blast 

Of trumpets while the fields are sore dismayed ; 

In Time's great balance such rule duly weighed 
Has been found wanting, its sure doom forecast ; 

" For two strong peoples shape the newer thought. 
With joined might invoke the reign of peace. 

Seeing each man's fatherland is where is sought 
Some nobler hope for true life's bright increase, 
And of one blood is goodness, and release 

From world-care by the whole world's toil is wrought ! " 

Two interesting experiments in music are found in 
this volume. One is a transcription of Gillet's 
" Loin du Bal," which seems to us to have a higher 



artistic value than the composition which evoked 
it ; the other is a symphony in verse, in the ortho- 
dox four movements, entitled " From Over-Man to 
Over-Soul," which suggests the similar poems of Mr. 
Charles E. Russell, reviewed by us last year. 

" Dexter "Wallace," we are given to understand 
is a pseudonym. His book of verse, " The Blood of 
the Prophets," is a collection of poems inspired by 
passionate indignation, but too rugged in diction to 
deserve much artistic consideration. Their indig- 
nation is directed toward the mammon-worship of 
our time, and the " Ballad of Jesus of Nazareth," 
which fills half the volume, is a plea for the spirit 
of Christianity as opposed to the practice of Chris- 
tendom. " Samson and Delilah " expounds a similar 
parable with equal effectiveness. We quote a stanza 
from the " Ballade of Dead Republics." 

" Tell me ye King-craft of to-day 

Where is Athens, who made men free ; 
Then sank into stupor by the way. 

Subdued by the Spartan tyranny ? 
And Rome that staggered to death, perdie, 

Stabbed by the sword of Hannibal, 
And bled by patrician infamy — 

The Dragon of Greed destroyed them all ! " 

This is technically the best poem in the book. Others 
suffer from over-vehemence of expression, as in this 
description of 

" The perjured Marshall, who with sorcery 
Planted the jungle of unequal laws," 

or of " this huge reptile, now a nation's Fear," which 
is the author's pleasant way of referring to Mr. 
Rockefeller. But such excesses as these may almost 
be condoned for the sake of the author's denuncia- 
tion of the Philippine iniquity, and of his stanch 
adherence to the fine older ideals of the Republic, 
so shamelessly flouted in these decadent days. 

When a man styles himself a minor poet, criticism 
is disarmed. In such case is Mr. John Burroughs, 
who has been told, he says, that his readers could 
forgive him everything but his poetry, and who 
nevertheless makes bold to collect his fugitive pieces 
into a volume called " Bird and Bough," with the 
following felicitous motto from Bunyan: "Some said, 
John, print it ; others said, Not so." " The Cardinal 
Flower " is pretty enough for quotation. 

" Like peal of a bugle 
Upon the still night. 
So flames her deep scarlet 
In dim forest light. 

" A heart-throb of color 
Lit up the dim nook, 
A dash of deep scarlet 
The dark shadows shook. 

" Thou darling of August, 
Thou flame of her flame, 
'T is only bold Autumn 
Thy ardor can tame." 

One merit Mr. Burroughs may and does claim un- 
reproved for his songs, that " they keep closer to 
our wild nature — to the birds, the flowers, the 
seasons — than most of our minor poetry has done."

There are no daisies and nightingales in his song, 
but instead arbutus and columbine and hepatica, 
the crow, the bobolink, and the bluebird. 

"My Lady of Dream," by Mr. Lloyd Mifflin, is 
a volume of lyrics of which " The Tryst with His 
Love " may be taken as an example. 

" When the wings of the tvrilight-legfion 

And the ghosts of the sanset pale, 
I float in the nebulous region 

Of a spirit-haunted vale : 
By the maige of a mystical river 

I make of my love a lyre, 
For she is a reed a-quiver, 

And I am the wind, her desire." 

This is charming, if ineffectual. It must be admitted 
that the author does better with the stately move- 
ment of the sonnet than with the freer utterance of 
the song. He has not the gift of liquid melody, 
whatever others he may have. The present volume 
includes a number of sonnets, and one curious ex- 
periment in the form of a two-octaved sonnet. This 
we quote as perhaps the most satisfactory poem in 
the collection. It is entitled "Imperial Inventress." 

" guardian of the sought-f or sacred fire ; 

Mother of splendors springing from the mind ; 
Imperial Inventress, let me find 

Melodious solace great as my desire ! 

Grant me to waken thine impassioned lyre 
To most mellifluous music, and unbind 
The bands of silence ; oh, once more be kind 

E'en unto me, the least among thy choir ! 

O Breath of Godhead, voicing mysteries 
That mortal men, unheeding, seldom hear. 
Fain would my spirit bend a reverent ear 

To feast upon thy heavenly harmonies ! 

Come through the sunset gates, or on the breeze 
Memnonian, murmur to me, spirit clear ; 
Breathe solace and dispel this life-long tear 

By mystic music sweeter than the sea's ! 

Give to this essence flaming seraph wings, 
Or bam it, incense-like, to thee and thine, 
Upon thy alter with its purging fire ; 

Strike thou at last from out these trembling strings 
Apocalypses of the inner shrine — 
O Breath of God ! make of my soul thy lyre ! " 

Fifteen years ago, Mr. Meredith Nicholson pub- 
lished " Short Flights," a small volume of songs and 
lyrics. Since then, the author has become widely 
known as a writer of acceptable fiction, but it appears 
from his new volume of " Poems " that he has not 
meanwhile forsaken the muse. We find in these 
pieces a graver and more reflective note than in the 
earlier ones — the natural mark of a maturer experi- 
ence and a widened outlook. "A Prayer of the 
Hill-Country " shall be taken for our illustration. 

" Lift me, O Lord, above the level plain. 

Beyond the cities where life throbs and thrills. 
And in the cool airs let my spirit gain 

The stable strength and courage of Thy hills. 

" They are Thy secret dwelling-places, Lord I 
Like Thy majestic prophets, old and hoar. 
They stand assembled in divine accord, 

Thy sign of 'stablished power forevermore. 

" Here peace finds refuge from ignoble wars, 

And faith, triumphant, builds in snow and rime, 
Near the broad highways of the greater stars. 
Above the tide-line of the seas of time. 



" Lead me yet farther. Lord, to peaks more clear. 

Until the clouds like shining meadows lie, 

Where through the deeps of silence I may hear 

The thunder of Thy legions marching by." 

Nature, art, and patriotic sentiment are the chief 
elements of Mr. Nicholson's inspiration. 

The metrical diversions of a score of years — 
mostly bits of verse — are collected into a volume 
called " At the Gate of the Century," by Mr. Harry 
Lyman Koopman. Neatly epigrammatic couplets 
and quatrains abound^ as this on Shelley's great 
lyrical drama. 

" ' Unbound, for who would bind it ? ' the perplexed 
And sneering critics of the poet cried. 
Whose son saw England's scholarship divide 
Over a doubtful conuna in the text." 

"Shelley's Birthday (August 4, 2792)" may be set 
beside the above quatrain to illustrate Mr. Koopman's 
more serious manner. 

" I stood before the open gate of birth, 
Where souls unborn await their doom to earth. 
Forth from the throng there burst a soul of flame, 

* Mine hour of birth, O Lord, the stars proclaim I ' 
To whom then gravely He : ' Yea, now at last 
The world is fit thy lot therein to cast. 
Bat, through thy haste, a thousand years ago 
Men called thee Shelley in that life below.' " 

Conventional verse of a rather commonplace kind, 
devoid of anything like originality and not notice- 
ably felicitous in diction, makes up the volume called 
"Words of the Wood," by Dr. Ralcy Husted BelL 
"Dreamland Voices " is a specimen well above the 
average. 

" Now sings the mated bird. 
Scarce knowing why he utters golden mirth ; 

The thrilling leaves are stirred 
With melodies of bird and sky and earth. 

'* From far-off fields of sleep 
I hear the drowsy phantom voices rise; 

There are no winds to sweep 
The misty murmur-echoes from the skies. 

"Serene soft stars eclipse 
Their fall-«yed gaze with lids of love half closed ; 

The g^reat world gently dips 
Beneath a sea of azure, opal-rosed. 

'' The half-wake grasses droop 
Where pools of moonlight lie between the trees ; 

And tall night-shadows stoop 
Like timid silence shrinking from the breeze." 

A "Threnody" lamenting the passing of the 
ancient gods, one of the poems included in a slender 
volume by Mr. Lewis Worthington Smith, closes 
with this appealing stanza : 
" Platsea's soil is sacred as of old ; 

In Salamis the white spray flashes still ; 
But nevermore in prophecy is told 

Apollo's promise or dark Hera's will. 
The winds may pluck the reeds for music mellow, 
Or buoyant lift some song-bird's throat of yellow ; 
But not again the god's deft fingers straying 
Shall charm the fawns and dryads with his playing. 
My steps from sea to height are longing-led ; 
The ancient gods are dead ; sweet Pan is dead." 

Another poem yields these couplets on Sir Francis 
Drake:

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



" Brother of Shakespeare, England's strength and will, 
As he was England's heart and mind, I fill 
One brimming beaker to the sword that hung 
Close at thy side, the ready hands that flung 
The power of Spain upon the tumbling seas 
With careless laughter as of kings at ease ; 
One brimming beaker as the pledge goes round 
And in our ears the world-wide surges sound." 

Mr. Smith has a fondness for long and swinging 
measures, as in the poem " Southern Stars." 

" The earth rolls onward night by night through wondrous 
' arcs of sky ; 
Aldebaran, the Pleiades, and Sirius go by. 
The Great Bear, Draco, Perseus, and Cassiopoeia keep 
Their silent watch of centuries, though I should wake or 

sleep ; 
But on my little spot of earth there may not come to me 
The vision of the Southern Cross above the Southern sea. 

"Job saw Arcturus, Plato watched the marshalled host go by ; 
Their spirits thrill to meet my own from out the midnight 

sky. 
Chaldean shepherds lost in awe are with me as I gaze ; 
Upon us falls the reverent hush of wonder and amaze ; 
But I may never share the joy, the rapture fine and free, 
Of those who watch the Argo breast the glowing Southern 

sea." 

Altogether, this little book seems to be worth while. 
We note in one instance the detestable malformation 
" thru ": is not even poetry to be spared this dese- 
cration ? 

A lyric and a sonnet shall be our illustrative ex- 
tracts from " The Moods of Life," a volume of verse 
by Mr. William Francis Barnard. The lyric is 
" Pioneers." 

" Too full of freedom's passion to endure 
The heavy bonds of custom, age on age, 
Men rise up, having strength and courage sure. 
And would in time's adventurous tasks engage. 

*' Alien in settled lands. Earth's titans these. 

Whose mighty strength must find fit deeds afar ; 
In curious search they sail o'er all her seas, 
Asking no guides save sun, or moon, or star. 

" And where they pause, enamored, for a time. 
They hear their hearts within, that long to go ; 
Which will not let them rest in any clime 

As long as worlds lie wide, and far streams flow. 

" They toil up mountains, pierce great pathless woods, 
They cross the deserts waste, then hasten on. 
Taming the earth for following multitudes, 

They face the beckoning sunset, and are gone." 

The subject of the sonnet is " The Graves of Shelley 
and Keats " in the Protestant Cemetery at Rome. 

" Is this where Death his jealous state doth keep 
Over two glorious ones, who early passed 
Out of the ways of song and into the Vast, 
Out of being into sealed sleep ? 
Is this the spot where Joy lies buried deep ; 

Where Hope and Love are hushed ; where prisoned fast, 
Young power and high desire are cold at last. 
Moving no more ? I smile, and cannot weep. 
Ye trees ; grey pyramid clearing the blue air 

Within whose shade the flowers with beauty bent. 
Grow thickly ; ivied walls ; and lingering wind ; 
Green grass, and sunlight ; is there otherwhere 
Fitter for poets on whose heads were spent 
The scorn and maledictions of Mankind ? " 



The defect in the third and fourth lines is unfortu- 
nate, particularly in view of the obvious remedy, 
which is nothing more than shifting the superfluous 
" and " of the one to its proper place at the begin- 
ning of the other. 

" Mystery of the West," by Mr, Henry Nehemiah 
Dodge, may be described as a sort of sectional epic 
of the discovery of America. Beginning with Leif 
and ending with the chained Columbus, the history 
is unfolded episodically, with lyrical interludes. We 
quote the verses called " Too Soon the Light." 

" Blow, night winds, blow your kindly, mystic veil 
Athwart the rift made by the Norseman's prow ; 
Let Vineland slumber yet awhile in peace, 
Lulled by her guardian ocean's melodies. 
Hide once again this earthly paradise. 
Whose waters flow unvexed, whose limpid streams 
Leap in sweet Freedom's haunts, where fearless drink 
All her wild creatures, in her love secure ; 
Whose forest wilds, untouched by the woodman's axe, 
In their primeval glory undefiled. 
Murmur their joy unto caressing winds. 
Too soon the light ! the world is moving slow ; 
These shores be for its riper heritage ! " 

This poem was written for the Phi Beta Kappa Soci- 
ety of Massachusetts. It is supplemented by " Com- 
ing of the Nations," a series of lyrical outpourings 
supposed to express the feelings of the various na- 
tionalities that have come to people the new world. 

From Miss Alice Wilson's " Actaeon's Defense, 
and Other Poems," we select this love-sonnet for its 
note of sincerity and quiet charm. 

" By all the ways of life I come to thee : 
Along the highroad of my common day 
In the full glare of trials that betray 
The frailties of my nature ; I come to thee 
Along the woodpaths of my fantasy 
Where once my virgin spirit loved to stray 
In lone delight ; and when I climb to lay 
My burst of rapture near eternity ; 

I come through vales where vespers have been ringing, 
What time my heart is touched with solemn grace ; 
And last, with spirit 'neath its sorrow stinging, 
I reach thee in its secret mourning place. 
Thou my horizon art, my life enringing 
And o'er it like a star is set thy face." 

We do not quite understand how a " burst " may 
be laid, but the poem as a whole is acceptable. As 
the title would indicate, classical themes are some- 
times chosen by Miss Wilson for treatment. We 
strongly suspect that she imagines " Iphigenia " to 
be accented upon its third syllable, and Herbert 
Spencer's tolerance of this fault is hardly enough to 
excuse it. 

Old clothes, old furniture, and old fashions are 
the chief themes of Miss Ellen Brainerd Peck's 
''Songs by the Sedges." A neat example is "The 
Spinet." 

" On the tinkling notes, and faint, 
Of the spinet old and quaint, 
Once pretty hands oft lightly strayed, 
Coaxing gentle melodies, 
From tiie slender ivory keys. 
In days when dainty tunes were played.

" In froek of dimity bedight. 
Of a fashion then the height. 
Perchance, some maid, demure and slim, 
Practiced here a canzonet, 
Or a gracefol minuet, 
In studied measure, queer and prim. 

" Now untondied the keys lie hid ; 
Silence sleeps beneath the lid. 
And the voiceless spinet seems 
Haunted with refrains of song. 
That to other days belong 
And eloquent of olden dreams." 

Miss Peck has a pretty fancy and a light touch, 
which are just the qualities needed for this sort of 
reminiscent verse. 

Miss Coletta Ryan is the author of " Songs in a 
Sun-Garden." She cries : 

" Oh, let me sing I 
The sun, tie birds, the grief-defying trees 
Are joyous minstrels, playing with the breeze. 
Through field and forest gleeful echoes ring — 
Oh, let me sing I " 

But we doubt if the permission should be granted, 
in view of the rather futile character of the outpour- 
ings that foUow. *• A Lover's Song " is one of the 
few things afforded by this volume that are reason- 
ably acceptable. 

" She is more golden than the golden sun. 

More silver than the silver moonlight's glow ; 
More fair, more rare, more holy than the one 
I taught my heart to worship long ago ! 

" She is more starry than the stars that fall 

Speechless beneath her beauty. In her eyes 
I see my bride, my heaven, and my all, — 
My light, my love, my deathless Paradise." 

This is all very well, but it seems to be a little 
hard on the one of long ago, now so completely 
supplanted. 

Of •' The Dream Child, and Other Verses," by 
Miss Norma K. Bright, we can only say that they 
have neither melody nor felicity of phrase, that they 
are often rude and sometimes even ungrammatical 
in construction. Ambition, for example, is thus 
apostrophized : 

'* Thou Spirit that fleeth so swiftly before me, 
How long have I thee pursued I 

Over meadows of green have I weariedly chased thee, 
But thou seem'st ever my grasp to elude." 

We have small sympathy for the Czar of Russia 
in his present predicament, but even he deserves a 
better fate than to be made the victim of such verse 
as the following : 

" A man is a man and a king ; 
As much a monarch as you ! 
With a soul to dare and to do ! 

Would you trample him low ? 
Have him bend and bow at your beck ? 
Put your foot, at will, on his neck ? 

The spirit cries ' justice ' loud ; 
What ! Do you merely smile grim ? 
Smile as at childish whim ? 
Then zealously flee from him ? " 

William Morton Payne.

The Frog'* 
Own Book. 



The last ten years have witnessed a 
marked increase in the output o^ 
books of natural history, nature books, 
and not a few excellent tales of unnatural history 
masquerading in the borders of the arid regions of 
pure (and, alas, too often dry) science. Publishers 
have awakened to the fact that there is a .growing 
demand for books in this field. The introduction of 
high-grade instruction in the natural sciences in the 
secondary schools, and the development of nature 
study in the graded schools, have created an intelli- 
gent constituency of no mean proportions, in whom 
natural history works of high standard conmmnd a 
quick appreciation. Not every candidate for favor 
has deserved success. Some have not reflected the 
essential scientific experience or training, and have 
consequently failed to develop the subject with due 
regard to proportionate values of its various phaseSi 
Others have sacrificed fact for effect, or have cov- 
ered too large a field in too superficial a manner; 
while a few do not rise above the monotony of a 
mere clerical compilation. In the main, however, a 
high standard of scientific acctiracy has been attained, 
and improvement in form and in illustration has 
been marked in the general level during the past 
decade. The latest number in that series of high^ 
grade works, ''The Nature Library" (Doubleday, 
Page & Co.), Miss Mary C. Diekerson's ''Frog 
Book," reaches the high-wat«r mark of general 
excellence. The scope of the work is not too g^eat 
for the space allotted ; the treatment is scientific, 
thoroughly modern and up-to-date, reflecting current 
university standards. The iUnstrations are ample 
and in the main well chosen. The subject is treated 
comprehensively, and the matter is sufficiently va- 
ried to maintain the interest of the reader. Above 
all, it is no clerical compilation made for the market^' 
but rather an enthusiastic recital of close and critical 
personal observation told without striving for effects 
The selection of material and the completeness and 
comprehensiveness of the treatment are commend- 
able. Little attention is paid to structural or ana- 
tomical matters. The introductory chapter deals 
with the distinction between batrachians and fishes 
and reptiles, development and metamorphoses, clas- 
sification, phylogeny, hibernation, poison, voice, color 
change, behavior, and distribution of the Batrachia 
Salientia, or frogs and toads. A well worked out 
key is provided for the identification of the North 
American species, and all technical terms are fully 
illustrated. The remainder of the book is given up 
to a detailed account of about sixty frog^, tree-toads, 
and toads, of this continent. Each is described 
briefly in the matter of color, measurements, and 
external characters, and a more or less extended 
account of its natural history follows. An extensive 
bibliography of scientific works and articles in jour- 
nals, dealing with the classification and natural hie- 
torj' of these interesting animals, is appended. The

illustrations are plates by the color-printing process, 
in which the colors are portrayed with excellent gen- 
eral efBect and considerable fidelity to the actual 
colors in nature. There are also over three hundred 
well-executed half-tones from photographs by the 
author, — frogs and hop-toads galore, front, rear, and 
side-view, in the water and out. In fact, there are 
almost too many toads for the best literary effect ! 
The final plate, whose legend runs " The bullfrog — 
independent, self-composed, alert," is the embodi- 
ment of batrachian complacency. The subject of

he seems destined to acquire. 

"Intermittent ^^^ ^^^^^"^ Rickett's "Personal

with the ' personal equation ' of the writers discussed 
than with the purely literary aspects of their work. 
- . . The guiding principle in the selection of names 
has been to exhibit as great a diversity of tempera- 
ment as possible " (p. vii.). The writers considered 
are Newman and Martineau, representing the moral- 
ist type ; Huxley, the scientist ; Wordsworth, Keats, 
and Rossetti, the poet ; Dickens, the novelist ; Ha z- 
litt and De Quincey, the vagabond. There is an 
" outline scheme of reading for students," and a 
drawing of the young Rossetti, made by himself. 
As a matter of fact, the title \i justified only by a 
few personal anecdotes that preface each lecture. 
For the rest, the book is devoted to somewhat dis- 
cursive literary criticism of the usual kind. Mr. 
Rickett quotes from Martineau the following sen- 
tence, which fairly represents our experience with 
this volume (p. 31 ) : '' True criticism seems to me 
the recorded struggle of the reader's mind into closer 
relations with an author whose intermittent bursts, 
helpful as they are, still do not enable him clearly 
to see his way." Mr. Rickett has, we think, indulged 
himself too far in the method of " intermittent bursts "; 
he leaves with us no impression of a well-considered 
singleness of aim. His style is choppy and disquiet- 
ing ; he does not permit us, in FitzGerald's phrase, 
" to sail before the wind over the surface of an even- 
rolling eloquence." The eccentric paragraph divi- 
sions contribute not a little to this effect, and for 
these the " colloquial form " adopted by the writer 
is not an excuse. Many of the " intermittent bursts," 
however, really show a sense of values and a preci- 
sion of imagery. " The curative influence attributed 
to ' light rays,' from which heat rays have been 
excluded, suggests an analogy with the influence of 
Wordsworth's work. The ' heat rays ' of poetry find 
little place in his calm, meditative muse ; all that 
can fever or distract has been eliminated. What 
remains is a beneficent focus of cool light " (p. 109). 
De Quincey's literary style is " like the purple haze 
of a summer evening, through which we dimly 
apprehend the shape and contour of the scenery 
surrounding, all things taking on a strange hue and 
unsubstantiality" (p. 209). There are a few errors 
in matters of fact. The " Apologia " was not New- 



man's first book published after his conversion ( p.l5); 
nor was it the gifted author of " Dodo " who con- 
tributed the life of Rossetti to the " English Men of 
Letters" series (p. 223). And what, finally, is a 
" liberal. High Anglican " ? 

The progress of ^^ ^^^ Summer of 1904 the Govern- 
ctviiization in ment of the Congo Free State ap- 
Central Africa, pointed a commission of three to 
study the prevailing administrative system in Central 
Africa and to formulate suggestions for the amelio- 
ration of such evils as might be found to exist. The 
residts of this investigation have recently been given 
to the English-reading public through the medium 
of a small volume in the " Questions of the Day " 
series (Putnam) under the title of "The Congo : A 
Report of the Commission of Inquiry." The mem- 
bers of the commission, — de Cuvelier, Droogmans, 
and Liebrechts, — are men of eminent ability, and 
it is safe to assume that their task has been performed 
with becoming thoroughness. All important dis- 
tricts of the Congo were visited, and at every stopping- 
place sessions were held in which testimony was 
taken from all officials, agents, missionaries, and 
natives who presented themselves to make complaints 
or to furnish information, and also from scores of 
persons specially summoned because supposed to 
possess unusual knowledge of conditions. Hospitals, 
prisons, schools, missions, and plantations were vis- 
ited, and the search was carried relentlessly into the 
offices of government employees and the counting- 
rooms of commercial agencies. The main topics 
taken up in the commission's report are the land 
rSgime, taxation, military service, trade concessions, 
depopulation, and the administration of justice. In 
respect to all of these matters, numerous evils are 
pointed out : the arrogance of the Government in 
appropriating alleged vacant lands, the oppressive- 
ness of the labor tax, the terrorism and cruelty 
resulting from quasi-military expeditions, the exploi- 
tation of the natives by agents of greedy commercial 
companies, and the lax jurisdiction of the territorial 
courts. Nevertheless, the conclusion of the report 
is that the twenty years which have elapsed since 
the creation of the Free State have witnessed a tre- 
mendous improvement in conditions — an advance 
from gross barbarism to at least an outward confor- 
mity with the rules of civilization. The slave-trade 
has disappeared, cannibalism has been practically 
suppressed, and sacrifices of human beings have be- 
come rare. The railroad, the telegraph, the postal 
system, the schools, churches, and hospitals, — all 
born of yesterday, — give the traveller the impres- 
sion that he is in a land which has long enjoyed the 
blessings of western civilization rather than one 
which but a quarter of a century ago was totally 
unknown and savage. It is the Commission's opinion 
that, with the resources at its command, the Gov- 
ernment of the Free State has achieved really re- 
markable things, and that it has but to continue its 
labors to bring about a satisfactory solution of the 
much-discussed Congo problem.

A noble life 
in the service 
of humanity. 



Success in the field of medicine is too 
often measured, in this commercial 
age, by extensive practice, exorbitant 
fees, or spectacular surgery. The patient work of 
the investigator in medical and sanitary science is 
rewarded, if at all, by a liWng pittance, and his 
discoveries attract but little public notice. Yet few 
men add more to the safety and comfort of human 
life. No discovery in the field of medicine in recent 
years has contributed so much to the safety of life 
and the stability of commerce, transportation, and 
industry, in the warm temperate and tropical climates, 
as that of Dr. Walter Reed, who first conclusively 
proved that the mosquito is the active agent in the 
transmission of that scourge of the South, the yellow 
fever. The story of " Walter Reed and Yellow 
Fever " (McClure, Phillips &. Co. ) has been written 
by Dr. H. A. Kelly of Johns Hopkins University. 
Reed was a graduate of the University of Virginia, 
and of medicine, at an early age ; he was an army 
surgeon in the far Southeast for many yeare, and 
took up his scientific work relatively late in life. 
During the Spanish war the opportunity came to 
him to carry out a series of critical experiments 
which proved beyond cavil that yellow fever is trans- 
ferable only by the bite of an infected mosquito or 
by transfusion of infected blood. The results of his 
discovery made it possible to stamp out yellow fever 
in Cuba within a year, where it had been entrenched 
for centuries ; and to reduce the mortality and check 
the spread of the disease, and eventually to stamp 
it out, in New Orleans, on the occasion of its last 
invasion of this country. Methods of quarantine 
have been made doubly eifective, and at the same 
time far less costly and disruptive of commerce and 
travel, by reason of Dr. Reed's discovery. The story 
of his life reveals a man of the greatest fidelity' to 
friends and duty, an heroic cliai-acter, and an inspira- 
tion to all who would serve humanity by a scientific 
study of the causes of the iUs of men. Incidentally 
the book gives a very full account of the long cam- 
paign of investigation waged against the yellow 
fever plague, and of the experiments which finally 
resulted in victory. 

Palestine " ^^^ Development of Palestine Ex- 

on the surface ploration " (Scribner), by Dr. Fred- 
and beneath. gj.ick Jones Bliss, the well-known 
explorer and lecturer, is an ambitious work covering 
in small compass a large tract of history. Explora- 
tion, in the sense of excavation, is practically a 
modern idea. All earlier attempts to understand 
and interpret the country were superficial, and did 
not achieve any notable results. Renan and his con- 
temporaries began a closer study of objects and 
ruins that pointed to the possibilities of larger things ; 
but the organization of the Palestine Exploration 
Fund marked the first attempt to study scientifically 
the land of the Israelites. Excavations were beg^n 
also on the site of Jerusalem, to ascertain facts re- 
garding the situation, size, and structure of the old 
city. Practically ever}'thing that has been done of 



any real value in these fields falls within the last 
forty years. Dr. Bliss sees great possibilities in 
future exploration and excavations when made by 
competent specialists. — A very different book is that 
of an Italian lady, Matilde Serao, " In the Country 
of Jesus" (Dutton), which takes its place in the 
lighter literature of its subject. Here we find many 
unusual out-of-the-way things, seen by the keen eye 
of an experienced traveller, woven by a devout 
Catholic Italian mind into an attractive and charm- 
ing narrative. At every point of interest — as, for 
example, at Bethel or in Galilee, — the author has 
caught and recorded things that nine-tenths of the 
travellers and writers would never see or think of 
mentioning. Devoutness, too, is found everywhere, 
except where the author attempts a bout with a 
dragoman or a cunning impostor. Her picturesque 
narrative is illustrated by a few first-class half- 
tones of some of the choicest scenes on the jour- 
ney. The evident enthusiasm of the writer enlivens 
the M'hole story, and makes the reader feel like en- 
gaging quarters on the next steamer to Jaffa, that 
he too may be stirred by the same sights and 
scenes. 

Telling and Everyone who is interested in the 

Bible sto'-iei religious instruction of children will 
for the vounsi. welcome Mrs. Houghton's '' Telling 
Bible Stories " (Scribner). There are certainly few 
subjects in which the need for help is greater ; for 
even the most conscientious mother is often baffled, 
as Mrs. Houghton says, by the question, '' Knowing 
as I do that the Old Testament is not precisely such 
a book as I was taught to think it, and not knowing 
as yet precisely what sort of book it is, how shall I 
interpret it to my children?" Mrs. Houghton an- 
swers this question in a way likely to satisfy a'l but 
the most conservative. She believes in two broad 
principles, — first, that the Old Testament, which is 
"the marvellous and accurate revelation of human 
nature in all its elemental characteristics," is of 
all books best adapted to the child, who is the true 
representative of the essential elements of human 
nature ; and, second, that the right method of telling 
Bible stories is not to insist upon their truth as a 
matter of historic fact, but to ask what is their true 
meaning. This, as Dr. Mimger reminds us in his 
excellent Introduction to the book, was the method 
of the Head-Master of Uppingham, who always said 
to his boys, *' Never mind whether the story is true 
or not ; what does it mean ? " Mrs. Houghton does 
not re-tell many of the stories, but recommends ad- 
herence to the Bible wording, since "poetic imagery 
never puzzles the child until we begin to explain it 
to him." She classifies the stories into groups for 
children of different ages — a group of " Morning 
Stories " for the very little folk, of " Hero and Ro- 
mance Stories " for those next older, and of "Purpose 
Stories" for growing young people; and she inter- 
prets a large number of them in an interesting and 
suggestive way. It is a pity that so excellent a book 
has no index.

[Oct. 1, 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A companion volume to his " Choice of Books " has 
been prepared by Mr. Frederic Harrison, and is en- 
titled " Memories and Thoughts : Men, Books, Cities, 
Art." The forty chapters of which it consists are partly 
autobiographical, and have a delightful width of scope, 
as indicated by the title. It is the fine tone, the genial 
atmosphere, the rich suggestiveness, of Mr* Harrison's 
writings that attract the reader and win him over to the 
cause of good literature. These attributes, rather than 
any specific advice on the choice of books, will help to 
keep the dust from settling on the classics on our library 
shelves. To pursue a prescribed course of reading is 
labor and sorrow, and the wisdom of those who counsel 
such pursuit is foolishness, unless perhaps in the case 
of very young readers. 

The series of "Heroes of the Nations " (Putnam) must 
of necessity include a biography of America's greatest 
hero, George Washington, and this has now appeared 
from the pen of a Virginian, Professor James A. Harri- 
son. The book is written with enthusiasm for the subject, 
and for the state and the life therein during Washing- 
ton's time. But while it is interesting as a general 
description of times and conditions, it lacks clearness 
and definiteness as a biography. It aims to portray the 
patriot, soldier, statesman ; it does show Washington as 
a patriot from his own letters as well as from his deeds, 
but it gives almost nothing about him as a soldier except 
rhapsody, and passes over in a few scanty pages the 
fateful period of his presidency. Rhetorical descrip- 
tions abound, and there are digressions not a f«w; but 
the portrait presented in the work is hazy and inade- 
quate in all that relates to Washington's public life. 

It is not long that university men have been giving 
attention to the problems of the elementary school, but 
in recent days the men of practical training are tak- 
ing up the discussion of school problems, and essays and 
addresses on educational subjects are becoming more 
frequent. Thus university professors are coming to exert 
the influence that they ought to exert both upon the 
school course and the spirit of the schools. Among the 
more sensible and practical of these is Professor Jere- 
miah W. Jenks, who has put into a small volume under 
the title " Citizenship and the Schools " (Holt) nine 
of the addresses and articles produced by him during 
the last twenty years. The prominent thought of most 
of these papers is the training of children and young 
people into a sense of their social obligation and civic 
duty. Besides these we find " Education for Commerce, 
the Far East " that ought to be worth many thousands 
of dollars to the manufacturers and merchants of our 
country; a theoretical "Critique of Educational Values"; 
and an elaborate article on " School-book Legislation," 
written fifteen years ago when the subject was especially 
prominent, but brought down to date. 

" The Fair Maid of Perth," the last of Scott's really 
good novels, is commended by Mr. Andrew Lang in his 
recent life of Sir Walter. Simon Glover's beautiful 
daughter, when she condescends to dismount from her 
high stilts, is very natural and human and winsome, as 
Mr. Lang says ; but the poor girl is made to talk like a 
book, and a very correct and pious book too, almost 
every time she opens her mouth. Scott's spirit of 
chivalry, which, as is well known, hindered any near 
approach to realism in his treatment of his heroines, 
here operates to the full. The clan combat in the story 



is called by Mr. Lang " one of the best in fiction." But 
who can recall without a shudder that horrible butch- 
ery, deliberately planned by the King's covincillors, and 
grimly executed by thirty foemen on a side within an 
enclosed space whence there was no escape except for 
the last survivor ? One feels that the great artist here 
fails to realize what it is he is setting forth in such brave 
colors. Interesting is the biographer's note that " in 
Conachar, who ' has drunk the milk of the white doe,' 
his foster mother, Scott expiates his extreme harshness 
to a ne'er-do-well brother, who had shown the white 
feather in the West Indies " — and whom, except to 
supply him with money. Sir Walter would have nothing 
to do with thereafter. 



Notes. 



" On Reading," an essay by Dr. Georg Brandes, 
which appeared some months ago as a contribution to 
the now defunct " International Quart«rly," is published 
as a booklet by Messrs. Fox, Duffield, & Co. 

The acquisitive impulse shows itself unmistakably in 
the passion for collecting and collections. Some have 
been known to find pleasure even in the collecting of 
strings. Miss Carolyn Wells now adds to her collec- 
tions of the lighter forms of literature a " Whimsey 
Anthology," which will soon appear, to gladden the 
hearts of the whimsical. 

The question of the authorship of " Truth Dexter " 
and " The Breath of the Gods " is now settled. " Sidney 
McCall " proves to be Mrs. Ernest F. Fenollosa. The 
title-page of the novel, " The Dragon Painter," to be 
published this month by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., 
will bear the name of Mary McNeill Fenollosa as its 
author and as author of the other two books above 
named. 

" Experimental Physiology and Anatomy for High 
Schools," by Mr. Walter HoUis Eddy, is a text-book 
prepared to cover the Harvard entrance requirements. 
It is a publication of the American Book Co., from 
whom we have also " Half Hours with Fishes, Reptiles, 
and Birds," an " eclectic reading " prepared by Profes- 
sor C. F. Holder, and Professor W. C. Morey's " Out- 
lines of Ancient History." 

" A Bibliography of the History of the United States 
Navy," compiled by Mr. Charles T. Harbeck and re- 
vised and edited by Miss Agnes C. Boyle, has just been 
privately printed by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
at the Riverside Press, in an edition of 350 copies. 
This is said to be the first attempt to gather into book 
form bibliographical material relating to the history of 
the United States Navy. 

Statistics, which we know can prove anything, but 
which in this instance appear not untrustworthy, have 
been compiled to show the fate of magazine publication 
in Chicago — using the word " magazine " in a some- 
what elastic sense. Out of more than three himdred 
periodicals started here, forty-nine per cent, lived but a 
year or less, only a quarter of the number struggled on 
for five years, and no more than twelve per cent, are 
now alive. Of these thirty-six, nearly half are under 
five years old. But a high rate of mortality — infant 
mortality at that — is common among periodical publi- 
cations everywhere; and this is especially true in the 
early history of a community or a region.

AN IMPORTANT NEW BOOK BY MRS. DYE 

MCDONALD < 
OREGON 

A TALE OF TWO SHORES 

By EVA EMERY DYE 

Author of "McLouGHLiN of Old Oregon," "The Conquest," etc. 

MRS. DYE has now established her unequalled 
position as the historian-novelist of the 
Northwest. Not only is her knowledge and 
authority beyond question, but she has developed 
the possibilities of history in fiction form farther 
than any other American writer. 

The chance casting away of a party of Japanese 
on the Oregon coast many years ago inspired 
Ronald McDonald, a fully historical personage, 
to enact a similar drama in his own proper self 
with the characters and continents reversed. In 
Japan he was permitted to establish a school, and 
it was actually his pupils who acted as interpreters 
during the negotiations with Commodore Perry. 
Mrs. Dye learned her facts from McDonald's 
own lips, and only deferred publication until his 
papers finally reposed in her hands.

general reader it must prove one of the most fascinating memoirs ever written. It will take its place not only as the 
life of Sir Henry Irving, but as a valuable contribution to the social history of the time it covers.

THE NOTE OF MODERNITY. 

" There are still those who view all modem 
work wath timorou.s suspicion," says a wTiter iii 
a recent English jjeriodieal ; "to them I would 
pleatl for a jn.ster vision of the artistic possi- 
bilities which lie before lis, in the near future ; 
plead for a realization of the fact tliat modemit}- 
does not ueces.sarily sjiellaifectation, tliat uovelty 
of technique and idea neetl not be ephemeral, 
but that the workei-s of every age must seek new 
tools, and that the age which is now on us calls 
for utterly different methods of expression from 
those of the past ; plead also for recognition of 
the fact that the cla.ssics of tomoiTow are lieing 
created to-<lay." The substantial soundness of 
the view thus expi-es-sed is obvaous enough, and 
the history of genius exemplifies it in manifold 
instances. All art tends to become fossilized 
under the pressure of precept and ti-adition, and 
can save itself fi-om death only by a succession 
of fresh deijai-tiires. And every artist knows, as 
Wagner did, 

" That art is still athirst 
For water from the deep aiid living spring 
Of nature, that of all its aims the first 
Is beauty, that death's bondage it must burst 
In every age anew, and boldly fling 
Aside the cerements that about it cling." 

Nevertheless, the writer whom we have qiiote<l 
seems to be neetUessly concerned. The " new 
thing," whether in literature or music or paint- 
ing, is likely to get too large, rather than too 
small, a shai-e of the attention of our ciuious and 
restless modern public. The time is past when 
a bright light coidd remain long concealed under 
a bushel, and the present danger is rather that 
we may mistake a farthing dip for a beacon. The 
artistic atmosphere is so surchargetl with electri- 
city that we get sparks from the most unexpectetl 
sources. We caught the conservative '• Satur- 
day Review " afew weeks ago complaining of Mr. 
Alfretl Austin because — of all reasons ! — his 
poems fail to strike the modern note as we heai* 
it in the lucubrations of ^Ir. Bernanl Shaw and 
Mr. H. G. Wells. When such a plaint is heard 
from such a quarter, we shoidd say that the timr 
had come, not to rally under the banner of modern- 
ity, but rather to champion more stoutly than ever 
before what has been tried and approved i-ather 
than what is ex])erimental and of dubious wortlu 



226 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Confining our attention to art in its literary 
manifestations, let us attempt some sort of 
analysis of what the term " modernity " means 
when thus used as a shibboleth or watchword. 
In the first place, it nearly always means some 
form of marked novelty in expression. No mat- 
ter how shallow a writer's thought, and how 
empty his mind of all real ideas, if he can con- 
trive to give his work a certain pungency by the 
use of strange vocables in unexpected colloca- 
tions he will pass as an original thinker with 
readers who do not think for themselves. A deft 
employment of the catchwords of the clique, or 
of those phrases which are the ripples of the fash- 
ionable literary current, will win for him the 
reputation of being abreast of the latest thought. 
K, in addition to this journalistic instinct for 
actuality, he develope an aptitude for paradox, 
his admirers will multiply ; for paradox always 
suggests, to minds that cannot sound its hollo w- 
ness, concealed reserves of intellectual energy. If, 
finally, he become boldly radical, and denounce 
as prejudices the most cherished beliefs and the 
most solemn convictions of the serious-minded, 
he may become the founder of a cidt and find 
himself invested with the robes of the prophet. 

Some sort of novelty, then, achieved at no 
matter what cost of beauty or sanity, is an es- 
sential part of the equipment of the "modem" 
in literature. The semblance of freshness thus 
acquired, the pretence of original thought thus 
exploited, will impose upon many minds, and, 
to use Bismarck's famous description of Lord 
Salisbury, the " lath painted to look like iron " 
will deceive most careless observers. The cour- 
age which prompts this pose is that of ignorance 
rather than of conviction, but the credulity of 
those who accept it for what it appears may be 
trusted to bear the strain. It is from ignorance 
of the most invincible kind that these novelty- 
mongers derive their self-assurance, and it is the 
same proud possession that prevents their fol- 
lowing from ever discovering how false are the 
gods of their worship. To make the pose com- 
plete, a herald of the new enlightenment must 
affect a scornful condescension toward his prede- 
cessors in the particular field he may have chosen, 
and he may rely upon his henchmen to better 
the instruction thus offered. So we sometimes 
witness the instructive spectacle of a Shavian or 
an Omarian patronizing the great poets and dram- 
atists, of a Nietzschian or a Spencerian consign- 
ing aU past philosophers to the rubbish-heap. 

When we hear some contemporary writer 
acclaimed as a typical representative of the 
modern spirit, it means at best no more than 



that he falls in with the intellectual fashion of 
the day, and is the puppet of his environment 
rather than a shaper of new issues. At worst, 
it means that he is a conscious time-saver rather 
than a devoted knight of the spirit. The favorite 
of the hour may seem to be the very incarnation 
of modernity — but it is for the hour only. Soon 
he will be seen to have been but a unit in a long 
procession of barely remembered figures, while 
some one of his contemporaries, unappreciated 
when living, may be seen to have been the truer 
modern, in the sense that his thought really 
anticipated the now realized future. It is not 
in the market-place, but in the den, 

" In far retreats of elemental mind," 
that the problems are worked out whereby 
mankind grows in spiritual stature. In a broad 
sense, Goethe was the gTeatest of all the mod- 
ems, and we now imderstand this fact far better 
than it was ever understood when he was alive. 

The conservative attitude toward literary 
innovation is doubtless the only safe one to 
assume, although a too rigid conservatism has 
its dangers also. But there is nowadays so much 
noisy trumpeting of unimportant \\Titers that 
we shall be right nine times out of ten in view- 
ing such cases with suspicion, and in remaining 
imperturbed by the clamor. Schopenhauer dis- 
coursed wisely upon many subjects, but upon 
none more wisely than upon this. By way of 
conclusion, we may suitably reproduce some of 
his words : 

" The history of literature generally shows all those 
who made knowledge and insight their goal to have 
remained unrecognized and neglected whilst those who 
paraded with the vain show of it received the admira- 
tion of their contemporaries, together with the emolu- 
ments. . . . It is a prime condition for doing any great 
work — any work which is to outlive its own age, that 
a man pay no heed to his contemporaries, their views 
and opinions, and the praise or blame which they bestow. 
This condition is, however, fulfilled of itself when a 
man really does anything great, and it is fortunate that 
it is so. For if, in producing such a work, he were to 
look to the general opinion on the judgment of his col- 
leagues, they would lead him astray at every step. 
Hence, if a man wants to go down to posterity, he must 
withdraw from the influence of his own age." 



A NEW MASTER OF ENGLISH PROSE, 
AND SOME THEORIES OF VALUE. 



In entering upon a somewhat extended consid- 
eration of the work of a new English writer, Mr. 
G. Lowes Dickinson, may we unmask ourselves at 
once with the frank avowal that we regard him 
as one of the greatest living masters of English prose, 
and his views of life as representing the most

enlightened and reassuring ideals of a groping and 
troubled age ? If his books are not destined to out- 
last the pyramids, he wiU at any rate escape Libitina 
for many generations, and our literature is appreci- 
ably richer for his contributions. Moreover, it is safe 
to predict that 31r. Dickinson will come into his own 
not altogether slowly ; for, despite the baneful sweep 
of utilitai-ianism, we do respond in some measure to 
the call of the ideal and the beautiful ; despite dis- 
heartening and deadly failures, we feel that, even in 
our daily round, " Life it is that conquei"s and death 
it is that dies." If this is true, our Cambridge 
essayist may expect from his age a favorable verdict 
not long deferred, for in his pages the cause of Life 
and Hope and Beauty is pleaded with the convinc- 
ing power of an able mind and the winning charm 
of an almost perfect style. 

Before speaking as an advocate, however, he has 
examined as a judge ; and his plea for the things 
which are better appears as a natural result of an 
investigation at once reasonable, penetrating, and 
sympathetic, into the world about him and the vari- 
ous standards of life. In his " Modem SjTnposium," 
for instance, we have as participants a torj', a liberal, 
a conservative, a socialist, an anarchist, a professor, 
a man of science, a poet, a gentleman of leisure, a 
member of the Society of Friends, and a man of 
letters ; and in every case the speaker puts his views 
so well that the most ardent advocate of the partic- 
ular doctrine or theory could hardly desire a more 
attractive exposition thereof. To take an extreme 
case of this clairvoyant sympathy with the views of 
others, let us write down part of a speech from the 
lips of Angus MacCarthy, the anarchist : 

" • Oh I ' he broke out, ' if I could but g^t you to see that 
this whole order under ■which you live is artificial and nnnec- 
cessary I But vre are befogged by the systems we impose 
upon our imagination and call science. We hare been taught 
to regard history as a necessary process, until we come to 
think it must also be a good one ; that all that has ever hapK 
pened ought to have happened just so and no otherwise. 
And thus we justify everything past and present, however 
palpably in contradiction with our own intuitions. But these 
are mere figments of the brain. History, for the most part, 
believe me, is one gigantic error and crime. It ought to have 
been other than it was ; and we ought to be other than we 
are. There is no natural and inevitable evolution towarda 
good ; no cooperating with the universe, other than by con- 
nivance at its crimes. That little house the brain builds to 
shelter its own weakness must be torn down if we would fac« 
the truth and pursue the good. Then we shall see amid what 
blinding storms of wind and rain, what darkness of elements 
hostile or indifferent, our road lies across the mountains to- 
wards the city of our desire. Then and then only shall we 
understand the spirit of revolution. That there are things 
so bad that they can only be burnt up by fire ; that there are 
obstructions so immense that they can only be exploded by 
dynamite : that the work of destruction is a necessary pre- 
liminary to the work of creation, for it is the destruction of 
the prison walls wherein the spirit is confined ; and that in 
that work the spirit itself is the only agent, unhelped by 
powers of nature or powers of a world beyond. — that is the 
creed — no, I will not say the creed, that is the insight and 
vision by which we of the Revolution live. By that I believe 
we shall triumph. But whether we triumph or no. otir life 
itself is a victory, for it is a life lived in the spirit. To shat- 
ter material bonds that we mav bind the closer the bonds of 



the soul, to slough dead husks that we may liberate living 
forms, to abolish institutions that we may evoke energies, to 
put off the material and put on the spiritual body, that, 
whether we fight with the tongue or the sword, is the inspir- 
ation of our movement, that, and that only, is the trae and 
inner meaning of anarchy.' " 

How many of us ever dreamed of anarchy voiced 
in words like these ? And yet MacCarthy is possibly 
the speaker with whom the master of the banquet 
(who is, of course, 3>Ir. Dickinson in propria persona) 
has least sympathy. In our own experience, each 
new page left us more convinced that we were deal- 
ing with a man who had seen the whole in its parts 
and the parts in the whole, who had kept his feet 
upon solid earth while his eyes were turned to the 
signals from the heights, so that with each step we 
found ourselves more willing to follow his upward 
leadership. And the heights to which he leads us, 
or rather to which he invites us to climb by his side, 
are always beautiful, albeit occasionally dimly des- 
cried by myopic eyes or not qmte to be scaled by 
the waj'faring man. The greatest height, indeed, 
he himself never confidently achieves ; for he con- 
cludes his dialogue on '• The Meaning of Grood," a 
search for reality, with a glorious allegorical vision, 
and waking from it says : 

"So that I have had to go on ever since with the know- 
ledge I then acquired, that whatever Reality may tdtimately 
be, it is in the life of the affections, with all its confused 
tangle of loves and hates, attractions, repulsions, and, worst 
of all, indifferences, it is in this intricate commerce of souls 
tiiat we may come nearest to apprehending what perhaps we 
shall never wholly apprehend, but the quest of which alone, 
as I believe, gives any significance to life, and makes it a 
thing which a wise and brave man will be able to persuade 
himself it is right to endure.^ 

Accordingly, with his great Greek master and not a 
few others from the kings of thought, he seems to 
end his climbing in a cloud ; but it is a cloud light- 
ened by hope rather than darkened by despair, and 
enforces the thought that ** They see not clearliest 
who see all things clear." To other peaks, however, 
he leads us, where the vista is as clear as it is beauti- 
ful, and even the paths through the lower lying 
valleys have their own appropriate charm. 

The themes treated by Mr. Dickinson are not 
new, nor does the form of his treatment offer any 
innovation. Religion, the meaning of good, litera- 
ture, art in general, — in short, the thingfs of the 
mind and the spirit, — are treated in essay or dia- 
logue or letter, and we do not need to be reminded 
that these forms were brought to artistic perfection 
in olden days. The fact is merely that having chosen 
immortal topics he has treated them with not less 
largeness of outlook than clearness of inward vision, 
and has exhibited unerring judgment and unfailing 
skill in adapting his form to his matter. Thus he 
is manifestly right in his feeling that a discussion of 
the meaning of good belongs *' to the sphere of right 
opinion and perception, rather than to that of logic 
and demonstration, and seems therefore to be prop- 
erly approached in the tentative spirit favoured by 
the Dialogue form "; nor can we refuse to agree that 



228 



The dial 



[Oct. 16, 



this literary form comes closest to the interchange 
of actual conversation, " from which we gain our 
best lights on such a subject." The same unerring 
instinct or judgment leads him to put his contrast 
between Eastern and Western ideals (" Letters from 
a Chinese Official ") in the form of letters from an 
enlightened Chinaman who has resided long in En- 
gland without losing his affection for his native land 
and all that it represents. Howbeit, other men are 
writing on these same eternal subjects without fail- 
ing to choose approj^riate garb therefor, so that we 
are driven to the jirovocative statement that our 
author treats the themes with greater power than 
most of his contemporaries and makes the appro- 
priate garb more beautiful. In the nature of things, 
it is impossible to justify such a statement by frag- 
mentary excerpts and curtailed arguments ; but we 
should be thoroughly surprised if many intelligent 
readers should rise from a perusal of Mr. Dickin- 
son's works with any strong dissent from the judg- 
ment we have submitted. 

Recognizing freely this impossibility, we must 
still face the duty of giving at least an adumbration 
of our author's position with reference to some of 
the central themes of life, and we may as well fail 
on Religion as on any other subject. His attitude, 
then, in marred and imperfect form, is about this : 

I. Religious truth is attainable, if at all, only by 
the method of science. There is no "revelation" 
in the accepted usage of the term. 

II. Religion is a "reaction of the imagination 
upon the world as we conceive it in the light at once 
of truth and of the ideal," which amounts to saying 
that religion is a certain attitude toward life, willing 
to recognize the helpfulness of ideas not based on 
definitely ascertained truth. 

III. If this definition is too wide, we should con- 
sider that there is something between hope and faith, 
but nearer to the latter and called by its name, — 
an attitude of "• active expectancy, the attitude of a 
man who, while candidly recognizing that he does 
not know, and faithfully pursuing or awaiting 
knowledge, and ready to accept it when it comes, 
yet centres meantime his emotional and therefore his 
practical life about a possibility which he selects be- 
cause of its value or its desirability." In other 
words, for practically all men there must be a " voli- 
tional assumption," not based upon knowledge, as to 
the worth-whileness of existence, if life is to be most 
noble and most fruitful. 

The objections to such a view were too manifest 
to escape our thinker, and he has stated them fairly, 
thereby relieving us from enlarging upon them ; and 
we may merely point out that this is the faith not 
of an ecclesiastic but of a platonizing philosopher. 
And yet, with the more recent work of our author 
before him Mr. Gilbert Chesterton could not have 
written his flamboyant if futile chapter on Neo- 
Paganism. Mr. Dickinson does not attempt " merely 
to revive the pagan idea of a simple and rational 
self-comjiletion." Rather, he looks for the tide of 



noblest spiritual progress where the lustrous and 
rapturous river from the pagan springs of Love and 
Beauty and Wisdom meet the more sober stream of 
ideals from the fountain of Christianity. The last 
speaker in the Symposium, who " expressed himself 
in a style too intellectual for lovers of poetry, too 
metaphorical for lovei's of philosophy," voices the 
thought in this glowing deliverance uttered in the 
glamor of the dawn. 

"It is only in the soil of Paganism that Christianity 
can come to maturity. And Faith, Hope, Charity, are but 
seeds of themselves till they fall into the womb of Wisdom, 
Beauty, and Love. Olpiipus lies before us, the snow-capped 
mountain. Let us climb it. together, if you will, not some 
on the corpses of the rest ; but climb at least, not fester and 
swann on rich meadows of equality. We are not for the 
vallej', nor for the forests or the pastures. If we be brothers, 
yet we are brothers in a <iuest, needing our foremost to 
lead. Aphrodite, Apollo, Athene, are before us. not behind. 
Majestic forms, they gleam among the snows. March, then, 
men in Man I " 

If we add this half-mystic flight to the formal state- 
ment essayed above we shall probably draw as near 
to the inner sanctum as our philosopher-priest cares 
to allow the profane to approach without longer 
service ; and even those who cannot accept his relig- 
ion and worship in his spu'it nnist feel their hearts 
quickened and their lives enlarged from visiting the 
courts of the temple by his side. 

From his views on art and literature there will 
be fewer dissenters. Where can we find anything 
on letters more exqiiisite than the sentiments of our 
Chinese official ? 

" Our poets and literary men have taught their successors, 
for long generations, to look for good, not in wealth, not in 
power, not in miscellaneous activity, but in a ti-ained, a choice, 
an exquisite appreciation of the most simple and universal 
relations of life. To feel, and in order to feel to express, or at 
least to understand the expression of all that is lovely in 
Nature, of all that is poignant and sensitive in man, is to us 
in itself a sufficient end. A rose in a moonlit garden, the 
shadow of trees on the turf, almond bloom, scent of pine, the 
wine-cup and the guitar ; these and the pathos of life and 
death, the long embrace, the hand stretched out in vain, the 
moment that glides forever away, with its freight of music 
and light, into the shadow and hush of the haunted past, all 
that we have, all that eludes us, a bird on the wing, a perfume 
escaped on the gale, — to all these things we are trained to 
respond, and the response is what we call literature." 

Hardly less effective is the treatment of Art in the 
dialogue on '• The Meaning of Good," a treatment 
almost as perfect in its way as the well-known 
stanzas quoted from the " Ode to a Grecian Urn " in 
the course of the discussion, to which we can only 
allude. Again, in the third or central chapter of 
the essays on Religion we may find the following 
thoughts on the contribution of architecture to re- 
ligion. 

" It has raised the material habitation of the Divine, and 
in doing so has reflected, I think, by a perhaps unconscious 
symbolism, the forms in which tliat Divine has been con- 
ceived. Surely, at least, one might question whether the 
difiPerence between a classical temple and a Gothic church is 
to be attributed only to a difference of climate, or of technical 
skill and tradition. It would be a curiously happy chance, 
if it were merely chance, that made the house destined for 
the abode of one of the bright Olympians a i)alace of gleam-

ing marble set on a hill by the sea, perfect in form, brilliant 
in color, a jewel to reflect the sun and the sky, a harp for the 
winds to play upon, an incarnation of the spirit of the open 
air, of the daylight and of the blue heaven ; while, for the 
mysterious Jehovah and the God Man His Son, there rose into 
gray and weeping skies huge emblems of the cross, crowned 
with towers aspiring to a heaven unexplored, and arched over 
hug^ spaces where the eye is lost in the gloom, where form 
is dissolved in vagueness, and the white light of day, rejected 
in its purity, is permitted to pass only upon condition that 
it depicts in sombre colors the pageant of the life of the souL 
That architecture has, whether by chance or no, a symbolic 
value, as well as one purely and simply aesthetic, will not, I 
think, be disputed by those who are sensitive to such impres- 
sions ; and, so regarded, architecture has been, and might be 
again, one of the chief expressions of religion." 

One recognizes throughout the doctrine of Goethe 
that art rests fundamentally on a kind of religious 
sense, and therefore unites so readUy with religion ; 
but one recognizes also an insistence with Morris on 
the possibilities of an intimacy and tenderness of 
art that shall allow it to become more easily an 
integral part of our daily lives. 

Foregoing the pleasure of commenting on other 
phases of Mr. Dickinson's works, we must content 
ourselves with a brief mention of his attitude to our 
own land. To the present reviewer he seems to be 
absolutely fair and candid, albeit his candor is of 
the unflinching sort. Far too many of his readers 
both in America and in England will be prone to 
find his final verdict in the speech of Arthur Ellis, 
the travelled journalist, and inasmuch as that contri- 
butor's arraignment of our " worship of acceleration" 
and our " doctrine of progress " is not less quotable 
than powerful, the reviewers and others wiU be sure 
to keep it before the public. Herein, however, we 
should be erring grievously ; for Ellis, although the 
giver of the intellectual feast regards his attack 
as formidable, sits down amid a " hubbub of laugh- 
ter, approval, and protest, confusedly mixed "; and 
a little later Sir John Harington, a gentleman of 
leisure interested mainly in art, takes up the jour- 
nalist's diatribe with the expression of a strong hope 
that the better age for artistic interests may after 
all dawn in America. But from neither journalist 
nor artist should we accept our essayist's real views, 
which may be best understood from his own delib- 
erate words in the introduction to the American 
edition of the " Letters from a Chinese Official." 

" For it is impossible not to recognize that the destinies of 
Europe are closely bound up with those of this country ; and 
that what is at stake in the development of the American 
Republic is nothing less than the success or failure of Western 
civilization. Endowed, above all the nations of the world, 
with intelligence, energy and force, unhampered by the splen- 
did ruins of a past which, however great, does but encumber, 
in the old world, with fears, hesitations, and regrets, the diffi- 
cult march to the promised land of the future, combining the 
magnificent enthusiasm of youth with the wariness of maturer 
years, and animated by a confidence almost religious in their 
own destiny, the American people are called upon, it would 
seem, to determine, in a preeminent degree, the form that is 
to be assumed by the society of the future. Upon them 
hangs the fate of the Western world." 

One who did not know many sides of Cambridge 
would hardly be prepared to hear this voice from her 



academic shades ; but, having heard it, one feels no 
serious rebellion against this other assertion about 
America : 

" For a century past she has drawn to herself, by an irre- 
sistible attraction, the boldest, the most masterful, the most 
practically intelligent of the spirits of Europe ; just as, by 
the same law, she has repelled the sensitive, the contempla- 
tive, and the devout. Unconsciously, by the mere fact of 
her existence, she has sifted the nations ; the children of the 
Spirit have slipped through the iron net of her destinies, but 
the children of the World she has gathered into her gran- 
aries. She has thus become, in a sense peculiar and unique, 
the type and exemplar of the Western world. Over her unen- 
cumbered plains the Genius of Industry ranges unchallenged, 
naked, unashamed." 

With the spirit of these words from the aged uni- 
versity beside the Cam, who shall quarrel ? Nay, is 
it not the best evidence of our strides toward health- 
ful manhood that we have no longer the childish 
and neuralgic sensitiveness we manifested under the 
searching criticism of a gifted son from the sister 
university on the Isis? Such critics as Matthew 
Arnold and Mr. Dickinson must help us to receive 
" the spirit of the world that created manners, laws, 
religion, and art, — which is hovering even now at 
our gates in quest of a new and more perfect incar- 
nation." Well will it be for us, and for the world at 
large, if this incarnation is achieved while our nation 
is yet young and time itself has not grown old. 

For a consideration of Mr. Dickinson's styleper se, 
we have little space remaining. However, the fore- 
going quotations have spoken for themselves, and 
we may limit our excerpts to one example of simple 
description, perhaps the most difficult form of artis- 
tically effective prose. It is introduced by the author 
in partial answer to the query as to what manner of 
men these Orientals are. 

" Far away in the East, under sunshine such as you never 
saw (for even such light as you have you stain and infect 
with sooty smoke), on the shore of a broad river, stands the 
house where I was bom. It is one among thousands ; but 
every one stands in its own garden, simply painted in white 
or gray, modest, cheerful, and clean. For many mUes along 
the valley, one after the other, they lift their blue or red- 
tiled roofs out of a sea of green ; while here and there glitters 
out over a clump of trees the gold enamel of some tall 
pagoda. The river, crossed by frequent bridges and crowded 
with barges and junks, bears on its clear stream the traffic 
of thriving village-markets. For prosperous peasants people 
all the district, owning and tilling the fields their fathers 
owned and tilled before them. The soil on which they work, 
they may say, they and their ancestors have made. For see I 
almost to the summit what once were barren hills are waving 
green with cotton and rice, sugar, oranges, and tea. Water 
drawn from the river-bed girdles the slojies with silver ; and 
falling from channel to channel in a thousand bright cascades, 
plashing in cisterns, chuckling in pipes, soaking and oozing 
in the soil, distributes freely to all alike fertility, verdure, 
and life. Hour after hour you may traverse, by tortuous 
paths, over tiny bridges, the works of the generations who 
have passed, the labors of their children of to-day ; till you 
reach the point where man succumbs and Nature has her 
way, covering the highest crags with a mantle of azure and 
gold and rose, gardenia, clematis, azalea, growing luxiuiantly 
wild. How often here have I sat for hours in a silence so 
intense that as one of our poets has said, ' you may hear the 
shadows of the trees rustling on the ground '; a silence 
broken only now and again from far below by voices of labor- 
ers calling across the water-courses, or, at evening or dawn,

by the sound of gongs summoning to worship from the tem- 
ples in the valley. Such silence ! Such sounds ! Such perfume ! 
Such color ! The senses respond to their objects ; they g^ow 
exquisite to a degree you cannot well conceive in your northern 
climate ; and beauty pressing in from without moulds the 
spirit and mind insensibly to harmony with herself." 

To borrow from an old critic, anybody could write 
that except those who have tried. But with our 
excerpts before us we feel most keenly that they 
have utterly failed to convey any idea of the charm 
of the complete works, and we fear we should feel 
the same even in the presence of the better selection 
that any of our readers could have made. 

Of the various works we have mentioned, the 
" Modern Symposium " seems to us the finest, al- 
though the others in their own way achieve an ex- 
cellence that need not fear comparison and will 
doubtless be preferred by not a few readers. The 
scene of the masterpiece is laid on a Sussex terrace 
in the month of June, and the dialogue, or rather 
the series of monologues, lasts from the late evening 
light to the dawn ; but the reader feels that there 
was never a flagging moment from the opening 
speech of the comfortably discouraged Tory speaking 
appropriately after a comfortable dinner, to the semi- 
oracular utterance of the poet-philospher speaking 
with even greater appropriateness while the glamor 
of dawn passed into the clear light of morning. 
Every character is made to speak in the language 
and style one feels inevitable. Indeed, one could 
easily transfer the speakers from the printed page 
to their accustomed walks of life, and in some cases 
could assign a definite name. There is not a faulty 
word at any turn, nor the least suspicion of striving 
for effect. The very transitions from character to 
character seem to bind the parts together and dis- 
appear in their service. Never has art been con- 
cealed more skilfuUy than in these pages, where Mr. 
Dickinson is most himself. In many of his other 
writings one can put a hand on this passage or that, 
and murmur Goethe, Landor, Pater ; but in this 
work one feels strongly only the great master of 
them all, who wrote the parent Symposium. And 
perhaps one could pay no greater tribute to the con- 
temporary Symposium than to say it is not unworthy 
to stand beside the Platonic original. Of course it 
falls far short of the older diaglogue in imaginative 
range, — which is merely saying that it does not 
attain the unattainable and ought not to be com- 
pared with the incomparable, for Plato's Symposium 
and Phaedrus still occupy a niche by themselves in 
the hall of fame of imaginative prose. In one re- 
spect, however, the modern product is, perhaps, not 
inferior, for it does keep a shade more closely in 
touch with our human hopes and needs. From the 
master's banquet one rises amidst the fumes of the 
strong wine of almost demoniacal possession, such 
as Plato himself describes in his doctrine of enthu- 
siasm, stimulating, exhilarating, sweeping us to the 
skies of fancy. At the disciple's feast is still strong 
wine ; but it is the wine of helpful, aspiring reason, 
glorifying and uplifting, preparing us to face " with- 



out excitement or elation the duties of the new 
day." 

It would be easy to select the writers who have 
influenced Mr. Dickinson most, but it must suffice to 
recall that his reading represents the curriculum of 
a Fellow of a Cambridge college with a cultured 
taste for literature and philosophy. We must point 
out, however, that the Greek classics have occupied 
the fundamental position in moulding his style and 
thought, and we regard it as a thrice happy accident 
that we were introduced to him through his " Greek 
View of Life," * for it is the natural portal. With 
modern literature he is only less familiar ; and 
American readers will even find manifest traces of 
Walt Whitman. In every case, however, the trace- 
able influence is entirely free from any suggestion of 
plagiarism, and we have no mere collection of jewels, 
but a new and finished product. Even the metri- 
cal quotations inspire the feeling that they should 
have been written for exactly the place they occupy. 
Over all of his writing is shed just enough of the 
poeticus color to make his style charming as well as 
effective. Indeed, for those of us who see in English 
prose one of the highest forms of art, — all the more 
important because it can ultimately be made to ap- 
peal to a practically unlimited constituency, — Mr. 
Dickinson at his best fulfils Sainte-Beuve's critical 
demand upon poetry, — il fait battre le coeur.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



Thk reading of Shakespeare is enjoined upon all 
by Professor James M. Hoppin, as conducive to success 
in various walks of life. His recent little book, the title 
of which is foimd in the first four words of this para- 
graph, tells us that " statesmen, political orators, preach- 
ers, essayists, journalists, authors, even poets, should 
speak only what they know axid feel from the bases of 
fact and nature, with Shakespeare's real knowledge; 
and though they might not become Shakespeares, they 
would come nearer to him in the plain path he led, and 
nearer to truth and sources of power." And yet Mr. 
Bernard Shaw insists that, so far from being a guide to- 
tis in practical affairs, Shakespeare could not and would 
not grapple with reality ; that to escape it he ran away 
and poeticized. Well, what is one man's reality is an- 
other man's moonshine. That view of things is real to 
us with which we are most familiar. As Mr. G. Lowes 
Dickinson observes in an article on Ibsen in " The In- 
dependent Review," Shakespeare saw the world broadly, 
as ^schylus saw it. He saw man in antagonism with 
a power or fate stronger than himself, and he was fond 
of choosing such types (like Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello) 
as should emphasize this antagonism ; although he could, 
and did, with his boundless sympathy and insight, create 
any kind of character in any sort of situation — a Fal-

in trouble. How many of us he has helped to " bear 
those ills we have " rather than " fly to others that we 
know not of." A solace in vexation, if not in crushing 
sorrow, is the reflection that " there is nothing either 
good or bad but thinking makes it so" ; and when things 
are at their very worst, we can still be sure that, " come 
what come may, time and the hour runs through the

President Euot's mitch-discussed plan for limit- 
ing the bestowal of college aid is thus curiously pro- 
pounded by one of its advocates : " The proposal referred 
to is that all applicants for scholarships be submitted to 
a physical examination in order that the trust fund at 
the disposal of the college for the maintenance of indi- 
gent students may be given only to such applicants as 
care to live long enough to give an adequate return for 
the payment." As if, forsooth, it were merely a matter 
of preference with the physically weak whether they 
shall resign this pleasing, anxious being, or continue to 
haunt the warm precincts of the cheerful day ! More- 
over, is it not known to be often true that genius, no 
less than conceit, " in weakest bodies strongest works," 
and that the sustaining power of a lofty intellectual or 
moral purpose will uphold the frail tenement long after 
its downfall has been predicted by the physician? Had 
Immanuel Kant, the poor saddler's son, been debarred 
by his physical frailty from receiving the pecuniary aid 
that he must have received (but whether from the 
Konigsberg Universitv' we are not sure) in order to get 
an education, should we now have any " Critique of 
Pure Reason," and what would modem philosophy be 
like? And Kant's example is but one of many. 

Sir Leslie Stephen's Life and Letters, pre- 
pared by Mr. F. W. Maitland, is an announcement that 
arouses very pleasurable anticipations. A quiet humor, 
" a humor with American touches that our men rarely 
attempt," was, as Mr. Frederic Harrison has remarked, 
one of Stephen's most enjoyable qualities. A very evi- 
dent and engaging candor was another. He meant what 
he said and said what he meant. " I like him because 
he 's always the same, and you 're not positive about 
some people," was Crossjay Patteme's encomium on 
Vernon Whitford in " The Egoist " — AMiitford, as we 
know, being Mr. Meredith's conception of I^slie Ste- 
phen, the " Phoebus Apollo turned fasting friar," the 
" lean long- walker and scholar," who traced a connec- 
tion between virtue and pedestrianism. On resigning 
his Trinity Hall Fellowship and abandoning his last lin- 
gering intention of entering the Church, Stephen turned 
to literature with the modest ambition to acquire suffi- 
cient facility with the pen to turn out an acceptable 
newspaper article. Poetry he appears not to have 
attempted. " I have," he confesses, " always had the 
difficulty which Jonathan Oldbuck tells us prevented 
him from being a poet : I could not write verses." Our 
best wishes are with Mr. Maitland in his undertaking, 
and our hope is for its speedy accomplishment.

Mr. Howelxs's plea for spelling reform, which 
lias been widely quoted, complains of our present spell- 
ing that it does not spell anything, that it is a sort of 
pictxire-\s-riting of a purely conventional sort. He fore- 
casts a glad future when we shall have an entirely new 
and strictly phonetic and absolutely representative 
alphabet. But even supposing it to be at the outset 



faultlessly phonetic, not only for London, but also for 
Boston and Indianapolis and Cape Town and Melbourne, 
how long would such an alphabet remain phonetic ? 
Prommciation is slowly but constantly clianging, as we 
occasionally learn to our surprise in reading old poetry. 
The human throat itself, and the vocal chords, are not 
fashioned after one invariable pattern. The Latin alpha- 
bet was probably once approximately phonetic to the 
Romans, the Greek to the people of Hellas ; but to Rome 
and Greece of to-day many of the letters of these alpha- 
bets stand for quite other sounds. Shall we then, in 
Mr. Howells's plan, have a new alphabet every five 
himdred or thousand years, for example ? The obvious 
loss would be greater than the possible gain. All spell- 
ing is and must be largely a matter of convention.

LiTERATtrRE REPEATS ITSELF, as history does. M. 
Ren^ Doumic, reviewing a group of new books on the 
theatre in a late number of the Rente des Deux Mondes, 
takes occasion to write : " Why does the dramatist strive 
so eagerly after realism? Because he knows that the 
public dearly loves to be thrilled by it. ... In short, 
the playwright is inclined to be satisfied if he wins the 
approval of the public, and the public goes to the theatre 
simply and solely to be entertained. It demands sen- 
sationalism, to be made to laugh, cry, shudder, thrill; 
but cares not a straw how this is effected." What is this 
but Plato's old plaint in the second book of the " Laws" ? 
He there says : " The ancient and common custom of 
Hellas, which still prevails in Italy and Sicily, did cer- 
tainly leave the judgment to the body of spectators, who 
determined the victor by a show of hands. Yet this 
custom has been the ruin of poets; for they are now 
wont to compose with a view to please the bad taste of 
their judges, and the result is that the spectators become 
their own teachers, which has operated to degrade the 
theatre. When they [the spectators] ought to have 
characters exhibited to them that are better than their 
own, and thus receive a higher pleasure, they themselves 
make these characters inferior."

Browning's defense of his alleged obscurity 
OF STYLE is now pretty well known. Nevertheless the 
following passage from a letter of his, preserved in the 
Raskin Museum at Coniston, may be of interest. " In 
your bewilderment," he says, writing to Ruskin, " how 
shall I help that? We don't read poetry the same way, 
by the same law, it is too clear. I cannot begin writing 
poetry till my imaginary reader has conceded licenses 
to me which you demur at altogether. I know that I 
don't make out my conception by my lang^uage — all 
poetry being a putting the infinite within the finite. Yon 
would have me paint it all plain out, which can't be. 
But by various artifices I try to make shift with touches 
and bits of outline which succeed [one another], to bear 
the conception from me to you. You ought, I think, to 
keep pace with the thought, tripping from ledge to ledge 
of my ' glaciers,' as you call them — not stand poking 
your alpenstock into the holes and demonstrating that 
no foot could have stood there. In prose you may criti- 
cise so, because that is the absolute representation of 
portions of truth — what chronicling is for history ; but 
in asking for more ultimates you most accept less medi- 
ates." This, except that " less " for " fewer " will annoy 
the purist, is well put. It emphasizes the value of the 
suggestive in art. The unfinished is sometimes better 
than the carefully elaborated ; " the half is more than 
the whole," as the Greeks expressed it.

Thoreau in Twenty Volumes.* 

It was a bold venture in book-publishing to 
promise the world an edition of Thoreau in more 
volumes than there are of Dickens the novelist 
as commonly reprinted in America. Dickens was 
born five years earlier, and lived sixteen years 
longer ; he was and is the most popular English 
novelist, and will long have many more readers 
than Thoreau. But when we consider that 
Thoreau could only find a publisher for his fii'st 
book at his own expense, that he was more than 
four years paying for that first edition of a thou- 
sand copies — which, if they coidd have been 
sold at the average price they have fetched in the 
past ten years, would have netted $20,000, — 
and that during the twenty-five years of Tho- 
reau's literary life he probably received less than 
$2000 for all that he published, the present 
undertaking of the publishers appears really 
extraordinary. Yet it is supported by the con- 
stant growth of appreciation for the genius of 
this long obscure author, and by the fact that 
his most casual bits of handwriting now sell for 
more than their weight in gold. In 1905 I 
knew a half-ounce of his manuscript to bring 
$40, which was five times its golden equivalent 
in weight ; and for what sum in dollars would 
the owner of the thirty extant volumes of his 
Journals now part with them ? 

Thoreau was the most industrious of all mod- 
em authors, and the one who devoted himself 
most scrupulously to his chosen task, which was 
Literature rather than Nature-study, though the 
world has long otherwise fancied. True, he 
pursued the study of Nature, as he did that of 
Greek and Latin, of Indians and land-surveying. 
But his ultimate aim was literature and philos- 
ophy ; and the celebrity that his writings are 
now attaining proves that he succeeded in this 
steady pursuit. His most intimate and appre- 
ciative friend, Ellery Channing, styled him 
" the Poet-Naturalist," and the title has been 
generally accepted ; yet he might with almost 
the same felicity be called a poet-philosopher, 
the term by which his eloquent friend Emerson 
has long been recognized. The poetic element 
in Thoreau is easily seen ; not so easily his 
philosophic wisdom and originality. This grows 
more and more striking as we are allowed to 
read more in the Journals, which are now being 

• The Writings op Henky David Thoreau. Walden Edi- 
tion. In twenty volumes. Boston : Houghton. Mifflin & Co. 



printed in fourteen volumes, four of which have 
already been given to the eager lovers of this 
ever-youthful poet. 

It was his poetic, ideal, transcendental side 
that Thoreau himself most valued ; and it first 
attracted his few readers of 1840-44 in the pages 
of Margaret Fuller's and Emerson's " Dial." 
In 1852, he writes in his Journal (Feb. 18) : 

" It is impossible for the same person to see things 
from the poet's point of view, and that of the man of 
science. The poet's second love may be science, not his 
first, — when use has worn off the bloom. I have a 
commonplace-book for facts, and another for poetry; 
but I find it difficult always to preserve the vague dis- 
tinction which I had in mind ; for the most interesting 
and beautiful facts are so much the more poetry, and 
that is their success. If my facts were sufficiently vital 
and significant, I should need but one book, of poetry, 
to contain them all." 

Earlier (Jan. 26, 1852), he wrote : " Poetry 
implies the whole truth. Philosophy expresses 
a particle of it." And later (July 18, 1852) : 
" Every poet has trembled on the verge of 
science." 

Again (Oct. 20, 1852), after his first visit 
with Ellery Channing to the Peterboro Hills 
and to Monadnoc, he wrote : 

" Many a man asks if I took a glass with me. No 
doubt I could have seen further with a glass, could have 
counted more meeting-houses, — but this has nothing to 
do with the peculiar beauty and grandeur of the view. 
It was not to see a few particular objects, as if they 
were near at hand, that I ascended the moxmtain, but 
to see an infinite variety, far and near, in their relation 
to each other, — thus reduced to a single picture. The 
facts of science, in comparison with poetry, are wont to 
be as vulgar as looking from Monadnoc with a tele- 
scope. It is a counting of meeting-houses." 

And yet very few men, technically scientific, 
ever made so many and so close observations in 
certain fields of natural history as Thoreau did. 
He was naturally an observer, and he narrowed 
his circuit of observation so as to facilitate accu- 
racy. His present editor — himself an ornithol- 
ogist, as Thoreau never was, technically, — finds 
a few instances in which this poet-naturalist was 
late or inexact in naming his bird. But let it 
be considered that he began these journals, and 
the chapters that he made up from them, at the 
age of twenty, and that he ceased to journalize 
at forty-four, — his noteworthy observations in 
his Minnesota tour (now in type for issue by 
the Boston Bibliophile Society) never having 
been written up by him because of his steadily 
failing health. What other naturalist, who was 
first and foremost a poet and man of letters, has 
ever made better observations, while educating 
himself to his chosen task of writing books ? His 
collegiate course, except as fitting him somewhat

in mathematics, did little to qualify him in natural 
history ; but his occupation as land-surveyor (a 
mathematical out-door trade) came in his mature 
years to supplement his early poetic opportuni- 
ties in seeing and delineating Nature, as she 
showetl herself in the valleys of the Concord and 
Merrimac. His account of those streams and 
their phenomena wovdd have been fuller and 
richer if he had published his '• Week " in 1859 
instead of 1849 ; for it woidd have had ten years 
more of fluviatUe, riparial, and celestial observa- 
tion behind it. But it woidd have been less 
poetical, and less saturated with the literature 
of imagination and religion. ^Vhat that was 
from 1837 to 1847, when he left his hut by 
Walden, may be seen by the fragmentary note- 
books printed in the first volume of the Journals. 
It was never Thoreau's intent to print these 
Journals as they now appear, still less as they 
were partially published by his editor after 1876, 
Mr. Blake. This third editor of the departed 
poet — Emerson and EUery Channing having 
preceded him in the task for a few years, — 
although a dear friend and almost an idolater of 
Thoreau, did not quite comprehend the sequence 
and connection of thoughts in that peculiar mind. 
He therefore rather broke up and parcelled out 
the Journals whUe editing them, and thus pre- 
sented them as detached and disconnected Ts-rit- 
ings, instead of making them centre aroimd a 
special subject, which was Thoreau's manner. 
It may even be doubted if Mr. Blake ever actu- 
ally sortetl out and classified the great mass of 
manuscripts which Sophia Thoreau left to him, 
— a task of i"eal difficulty, as every posthumous 
editor has found. He was Thoreau's senior in 
years, although long outliving him, and had a 
delicate modesty which \^dthheld him from that 
strict dealing with his author of which Emerson 
manifested rather too much. The letters and 
verses of Thoreau which Emerson held back from 
publication, because they might alter that view 
of his younger friend which he had long and 
rather wilfidly held, were placed in my hands 
by !Mr. Blake, or by Sophia Thoreau ; and I am 
told they have materially modified the opinion 
earlier readers had formed from the Emersonian 
legend and presentation. I felt sure that they 
would, as, indeed, Channings inimitable and 
racy life of Thoreau, first published in 1873, 
had already modified the opinion of such as read 
it against the restrictive view given by Emerson. 
The Journals, as now published, vntH still more 
correct the imperfect picture of Thoreau's mind 
and heart which was for forty years at least the 
prevailing impression. The patience of Thoreau 



— and few men were ever more patient — and the 
mercurial impatience of Channing both revolted 
a little, at times, at the fact that they were chiefly 
known through other authors, and not by their 
own essaj^s and verses. In April, 1852, the 
Journal records this : 

" I asked Ellery Channing yesterday if he had ac- 
quired fame. He answered that, giving his name at 
some place, the bystanders said: 'Yes, sir, we have 
heard of you. We know you here, sir. Your name is 
mentioned in Mr. Blank's book.' That 's all the fame 
I have had, — to be made known by another man." 

This remark of Channing was made at the time 
when he was offering himself as a lecturer in 
Concord, Boston, Providence, and elsewhere, 
with a success far less than Thoreau's at the 
same period. Yet Thoreau, except in Concord, 
and gradually in Worcester, did not prove a 
very attractive lecturer. As a promoter of other 
men's lectures he was indefatigable, like Emer- 
son. In the original draft of " Walden," from 
which much was dropped before it went to press, 
I found this passage which no longer appears 
in the Journal as here printed : 

«' How much, for instance, might be done for this 
town [Concord] with SlOO, if there were a man to do 
it! I myself have provided a select course of lectures 
for a winter, together with room, fuel, and lights, with 
that sum; which was no inconsiderable benefit to every 
inhabitant." 

It then occurred to me to look up in the records 
of the Concord Lyceum, of which Thoreau was 
often an official, the list of these lecturers, which 
he had carefully entered in the book, with the 
price paid to each. The date was about sixty- 
two years ago. The list included Emerson 
(three lectures), who received nothing ; George 
Bancroft, f 10 ; Theodore Parker, i3 ; Wendell 
Phillips, nothing ; Horace Greeley, nothing ; Dr. 
Charles T. Jackson (Mrs. Emerson's brother), 
f 10 ; Henry Giles, f 10 ; Rev. E. H. Chapin, 
$8 : James Freeman Clark, nothing ; Thoreau 
himself (several lectures) nothing, — and so on. 
It was a distinguished roll of names. The 
financial statement was there too, drawn up by 
Thoreau, — receipts, #109.20; expenses (care- 
fully itemized), #100 ; balance on hand, #9.20. 
Seldom has so much wisdom and eloquence been 
furnished to a Yankee village for so small an 
outlay. 

Thoreau, like others, had his own explana- 
tion of Shakespeare ; and it is to be noted, for 
all his criticism is worth heeding. He did not 
often read him, but he knew what his value 
was, though he preferred Milton, as he once told 
me. In the Journal for January, 1852, he 
has a suggestive comment. 



234 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



" The one word which will explain the Shakespeare 
miracle is ' unconsciousness.' If he had known his own 
comparative eminence, he would not have failed to pub- 
lish it incessantly." 

Thoreau was by no means unconscious of his 
own powers ; indeed, few men of genius are. 
He valued himself for what he knew he was ; 
but he was neither conceited nor did he pose, as 
some of his critics have fancied. He coidd 
undervalue himself upon occasion ; and in one 
of the passages omitted from " Walden " he 
wrote : 

" If the reader thinks that I am vainglorious and set 
myself above others, I assure him that I could tell a 
justified story respecting myself as well as him, if my 
spirits held out; could encourage him with a sufficient 
list of my failures, and flow as humbly as the gutters. 
I think worse of myself than he is likely to think of 
me, — and better, too, perchance, being better acquainted 
with the man." 

How, then, did Thoreau acquire his singular 
genius and character? Like most men, by 
descent and environment — chiefly the former. 
The editor of these Journals does not appear to 
know the family story ; nor was Thoreau him- 
seK perfectly informed upon it. On the mother's 
side he was descended from a Tory family — 
that of Colonel Jones of Weston, an old towTi 
seven miles from Concord. This gentleman, 
who died in Boston just before our Revolution, 
had one daughter, Mary (who became the gTand- 
mother of Henry Thoreau), and fourteen sons, 
of whom twelve grew up. Eight or nine of these 
sons joined the Tory faction, and most of them 
had to go forth from their native land into exile 
in consequence. Several of them served in the 
British army against their countrymen, and one 
of them. Dr. Josiah Jones, was a political pris- 
oner in Concord jail while the battle of Bunker 
Hill was going on, June 17, 1775. Mary, his 
sister, then Mrs. Asa Dunbar, carried him food 
from Weston on that day, as she did on other 
days, before and after. The family tradition on 
this point, which Thoreau recorded in his Jour- 
nal (not here quoted) was curious, but not quite 
correct. He wrote : 

" Col. Elisha Jones, my great-grandfather, was the 
owner and inhabitant of an estate in Weston, — a man 
of standing and influence among his neighbors. He was 
a Tory. His son Simeon was confined in Concord jail 
four months and a fortnight. His sister Mary brought 
every meal he had from Weston. He was afraid he 
might be poisoned else. There was one Hicks, and one 
more, imprisoned with him. They secreted knives fur- 
nished them with their food, sawed the grates oif, and 
escaped to Weston. Hid in the cider-mill. Mary heard 
they were in the mill; she took old Baldwin's horse from 
the lower part of Weston, and Simeon went to Portland 
with him, and then wrote back to Baldwin where he 
would find his horse, by paying charges." 



This story bears the marks and has the errors 
of tradition. " Baldwin " was the sheriff who 
arrested Dr. Jones (and perhaps his brother 
Simeon), and he may very well have connived 
at the escape from the authorities of Massachu- 
setts. We know that Dr. Josiah Jones, and 
another loyalist described as " the notorious Dr. 
Hicks," were imprisoned for attempting to send 
in supplies to the British army besieged in Bos- 
ton ; and we have no reason to doubt they escaped 
in the way indicated, and took refuge in Colonel 
Jones's unused cider-mill. Possibly Simeon was 
with them. All but three of the brothers of Mrs. 
Dunbar had to leave the country for their Tory- 
ism, and the family property was lost or dimin- 
ished by their taking the wrong side. At the 
same time, Thoreau's grandfather, John Thoreau 
from the isle of Jersey, was privateering on the 
American side, and thus beginning the fortune 
which he left to his heirs in 1 8 1 . Henry's grand- 
father Dmibar, a graduate of Harvard in 1767, 
headed a college rebellion in 1766, and found 
so many supporters among the wealthy students 
and their families that he was never punished, 
but graduated with honor. He was first a clergy- 
man at Salem, then studied law, and retired to 
Keene, N. H., near his brother-in-law Daniel 
Jones, practised law there and was active in Free- 
masonry for a few years, and died in 1 7 87 , before 
his daughter Cynthia, who married John Thoreau, 
the father of Henry, was born. From this mixed 
descent, with which a Scotch strand was twined, 
Thoreau inherited his mingled and rather con- 
flicting qualities, — his gravity, his humor, his 
touch of wildness, his mercantile method, and 
his independence of thought. Something ap- 
peared in him, too, — a spark of genius, which 
none of his known ancestors had shown. He 
was remotely of Norman, even of Norse, descent, 
probably, as so many of the Jerseymen were ; if 
he had French ancestors, they had long ceased 
to live in France, though speaking that patois 
of French which was the dialect of Jersey. A. 
certain French elegance of style in prose early 
marked the writings of Thoreau, and the beauty 
of style in the unstudied journal entries here 
published will attract frequent notice. 

Of all the writers of the Concord group, 
Thoreau will be held hereafter as the most 
original, where all were original in their own 
way. He was less dependent than Emerson or 
Hawthorne or Alcott on the books he had read 
and the traditions he received ; more indebted 
to Nature and his own free thoughts. The 
ten volumes before me prove this, and those 
which are to come will hardly cliange the ver-

diet thus far reached. He is fortunate, in this 
posthumous edition, to have the aid of an ad- 
mirable photographer, Mr. Herbert Gleason, 
who in years past, " all for love and nothing 
for reward," searched out and took pictures of 
those impressive scenes which Thoreau had so 
pictorially described ; and from these two or 
three hundred views the publishers have selected 
a hundred to be reproduced for these volumes, 
five in each. The process by which they are 
printed has darkened a little the delicacy of the 
original, but they are still wonderfidly true to 
the nature amid which Thoreau was mast se- 
renely at home. 

The form and tyix)graphy of the volumes leave 
little to be desired. There are some minor errors 
arising from the indistmctness of Thoreau's 
manuscript in places, and from the editor's lack 
of tliat minute local knowledge in which his 
author was so remarkable. For instance, there 
is no " Woods' Bridge " in Concord, and never 
was, though the "■ wooden bridge " near the 
railroad may sometimes have been so called, as 
leading to the farm of the Woods. It should 
always read "wooden bridge," as distinguished 
from the " stone bridge ' close by. Again, 
there was a Concord weekly newspaper entitled 
*' The Yeoman's Gazette," and its name should 
stand in capitals. An ocxiasional mistake in 
spelling is to be noted. But on the whole this 
" Walden Edition " is every way satisfactory, 
in its different forms for different purchasers 
^d prices. Y. B. Sanborn. 



liANDSCAPE IX Poetry.* 



There are few subjects more attractive to 
students of literature than the treatment of land- 
scape in poetry. To perceive the varying func- 
tions of natural description in the work of 
different races, ages, and poets, — the personi- 
fied nature of the Hebrews, the serene and vivid 
landscape of the Greeks, the delicate vignettes 
of the Middle Age, the detailed but conven- 
tional backgi-ounds of the Renaissance, the 
expressiveness of the inanimate world to modem 
eyes, — this involves an endlessly fascinating 
approach to the secrets of the poetic process. 
Despite the fundamental correctness of Lessing's 
main position in the Laocoon, the history of 
poetry gives abundant warrant for his caveat : 
" How many things woiUd appear incontestable 
in theory, if genius had not succeeded in prov-

Ages and in Modern Times. By Alfred Biese. Translated from 
the German. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co. 



ing them to be the contrary by fact," The fact, 
of course, is that the charm of poetry is, to no 
small degree, the charm of landscape back- 
ground. Fancy the Odyssey without Calypso's 
grotto and the harbor of Ithaca, Chaucer with- 
out his green and flowery May mornings, Spen- 
ser ^vithout his trackless woods and his dazzling 
if not wholly convincing gardens, Shakespeare 
without the matchless scenery that is of the very 
texture of his plays ; fancy Eden without its 
" bowery loneliness," its " bloom profuse and 
cedar arches "; fancy Keats without " the green 
world " of his daffodils and the " hurrying 
freshnesses " of his brooks, Wordsworth with- 
out his " mountains where sleep the unsiuined 
tarns " — to use a Wordsworthian line of Brown- 
ing's, — and Tennyson without his enchanted 
forests and his " dim, rich " cities. If the per- 
ception of these things is one of the keenest 
aesthetic delights of poetry, surely one of its 
highest practical benefits is to make us more 
vividly aware of the beauty of the world. 

The dearth of books in English on this inter- 
esting subject is rather remarkable, though it is 
no doubt due in part to the infrequency of a 
literary scholarship that is at once minute and 
comprehensive, and in part to the absorption of 
our students of literature in questions of literary 
history rather than in the more essential prob- 
lems of art. Professor Palgrave's well-known 
" Landscape in Poetry ' is sketchy and inade- 
quate. One reads it with a painful sense of a 
missed opportunity. Its range is not wide 
enough, and it is poor in examples. In this 
respect, Herr Biese's book on " The Feeling for 
Nature " is highly commendable. Within the 
limits that he has imposed upon himself, he has 
brought together a large and well-chosen body 
of passages that constitute the chief value of his 
work. His sense of proportion is, however, not 
faultless, and has led him to lay undue emphasis 
on many obscure German poets and prose writ- 
ers, to the neglect of the really significant names 
of modern France, — De Lisle, De la Prade, 
Heredia, and the rest, — not to mention English 
poetry of the later nineteenth century, which he 
almost ignores. While he treats Goethe, Klop- 
stock, Jean Paul, Rousseau, Lamartine, and 
Hugo with a gratif jnng fulness, yet it seems a pity 
to neglect the intensely expressive landscape of 
modern French and English poetry and emo- 
tional prose, especially as in these the feeling 
for nature is more simple, less complicated with 
what Herr Biese calls " the amorous passion," 
than in the work of the early Romantics. Surely,

most general survey of European literature. To 
Wordsworth, indeed, Herr Biese devotes a part 
of two pages, though the following critical re- 
mark, which is also the only one, is hardly either 
intelligible or adequate : 

" His real taste was pastoral, and he preached freer 
intercourse with Nature, glossing his ideas rather arti- 
ficially with a theism, through which one reads true 
love of her, and an undeniable though hidden panthe- 
ism " (p. 326). 

The famous skating scene is mistaken for a 
description of "sledging." But if Wordsworth 
is comparatively neglected, Byron, as is usual 
with continental students of our literature, is 
treated with fulness and enthusiasm : 

" All that previous English poets had done seemed 
harmless and innocent in comparison with Byron's revo- 
lutionary poetry. Prophecy in Rousseau became poetry 
in Byron " (p. 327). 

It is the more remarkable that Herr Biese 
did not push his researches into recent French 
literature, because, as his own examples prove, 
no German save Goethe equals Lamartine in 
the blending of precise observation with pro- 
found feeling ; and the question would therefore 
seem to be inevitable, " How far have modern 
French poets entered into the spirit of the Medi- 
tations ? " The following from Jean Paul ad- 
mirably illustrates the tone and manner of the 
German Romantics, and incidentally has a curi- 
ous resemblance to the landscape in Henley's 
beautiful lines MargaritcB Sorori : 

" The sun sinks, and the earth closes her great eye 
like that of a dying god. There smoke the hills like 
altars ; out of every wood ascends a chorus ; the veils 
of day, the shadows, float around the enkindled, trans- 
parent tree-tops, and fall upon the gay, gem-like flowers. 
And the burnished gold of the west throws back a dead 
gold on the east, and tinges with rosy light the hover- 
ing breast of the tremulous lark — the evening bell of 
Nature " (p. 348). 

Not many of the illustrative passages, it must 
be confessed, are as successful as this. The 
occasions are few when one feels the instant 
thrill of response to a direct, sincere, unconven- 
tional and imaginative natural touch. Phrase 
after phrase of description passes under the eye, 
leaving no definite image upon the mind, touch- 
ing no chord of feeling. All is vague, remote, 
abstract, lifeless. In spite of the clear objective 
beauty of the pictures in the Odyssey, one be- 
gins to suspect that the mere ability to see the 
significant aspects of what is under one's eyes 
is a modern achievement. To the passages from 
Shakespeare, however, this objection does not 
apply. While the list of examples is not, of 
course, exhaustive, it is sufficient to prove that 



his " grasp of nature was in tenser, more indi- 
vidual, and subjective " than that of any preced- 
ing poet, with the possible exception of Dante. 
To the vitality and significance of Dante's 
touches of description, Herr Biese hardly doeft 
justice ; while his praise of Petrarch and of the 
Renaissance attitude in general toward nature, 
both in Italy and England, is plainly excessive. 
That " English lyrists of the fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries showed deep feeling for Na- 
ture" (p. 222 ) cannot be maintained, despite the 
abundance of descriptive and pastoral poetry. 
In no respect does Shakespeare tower above his^ 
contemporaries more unmistakably than in the 
sincerity and vitality of his attitude toward 
nature. Spenser's description of the Garden of 
Acrasia (F. Q., II. 12. 58), quoted by Herr 
Biese as evidence of the " deep feeling for Na- 
ture " in the sixteenth century, is highly gen- 
eralized, wholly conventional, and therefore 
abstract and unreal. Moreover, it is an exceed- 
ingly close imitation of Tasso (Ger. Lib., 16. 9)» 
It would hardly be more absurd to talk of " the 
deep feeling for Nature " of the eighteenth cen- 
tury pastoralists. The conventional images and 
ideas of the Elizabethan lyric are shown, by 
Herr Biese 's own examples, to be derived in 
most cases directly from Petrarch. 

The critical and historical generalizations o£ 
the volume are not of so much importance as the 
examples. They are in most cases not very defi- 
nite, nor are the different stages in the develop- 
ment of the feeling for nature in mediaeval and 
modern literature sharply discriminated. Per- 
haps they cannot be, except in the most general 
way. And yet one clearly perceives the possi- 
bility of a more satisfactory treatment than Herr 
Biese has given us. His programme, however,, 
is admirable. He attempts to trace the feeling 
for nature from the Christian writers of the first 
ten centuries, in whom pagan elements still per- 
sist, to what he calls " the universal pantheistic 
feeling of modern times," though, as we have 
seen, he ignores its more recent manifestations » 
The " naive " feeling of the period of the Cru- 
sades, the Troubadours, and the Minnesingers, 
the " individualism and sentimental feeling" of 
the Renaissance, " the enthusiasm for nature 
among the discoverers and Catholic mystics," 
the artificial treatment of landscape, during the 
seventeenth century, in Germany and France, 
and the beginning and f idl tide of romantic feel- 
ing, with all its sentimental exaggeration, — 
these are the principal stages through which, 
according to Herr Biese, the treatment of land- 
scape in European literature has passed. He

devotes a few, not very illuminating, pages, also, 
to the history of landscape in painting. 

The vague and vin satisfactory impression left 
by his generalizations is, no doubt, due in some 
degree to his style, though for this the translator 
may be to blame. On the whole, however, the 
translation is workmanlike, and we fear that the 
responsibility for such sentences as the following 
rests with Herr Biese : 

" [Schiller] called nature naive (he included natural- 
ness in Nature); those who seek her, sentimental; but 
he overlooked the fact that antiquity did not always 
remain naive, and that not all modems are sentimental" 
[p. 346] . " And since Shakespeare's characters often 
act out of part, so that intelligible motive fails, while it 
is important to the poet that each scene be raised to 
dramatic level and viewed in a special light, Goethe's 
words apply," etc. (p. 167). 

There is far too much of the solemn pseudo- 
technical jargon that often makes German 
criticism such desperately hard reatling. The 
ingenuous reader believes, or at any rate hopes, 
tlaat he is not reading nonsense, but he has the 
disappointment of embracing a shadow whenever 
he attempts to grasp the meaning. The style, 
too, is without that coherence that depends upon 
distinctness of articxdation — a quality in which 
French criticism, for example, is almost never 
wanting. There is, moreover, a good deal of that 
specious encyclopjedic abundance which is so 
easy to obtain : it consists in the indiscriminate 
heaping up of names and dates that suggest, to 
be sure, completeness of treatment, but really 
breed confusion. 

Whether the translator is responsible for plac- 
ing Drayton and Drummond of Hawthomden in 
the eighteenth century (pp. 223, 224), we do 
not know ; but he must at any rate be held ac- 
countable for such eccentricities as Bernard von 
Clairvaux, Hugo von St. Victor, Vincentius 
von Beauvais, and for the odd locution, " The 
real Aristotle was only gradually shelled out 
from uuader mediaeval accretions "(p. 200).

WASHr>fGTOX AS HOUSEKEEPER 

AXD Farmer.* 



A volvune of the '* Lettei"s and Recollections 
of George Washington " is sent out with the 
explanation from its publishers that it is meant 
to show the great Virginian in a new light — 
that is, as a domestic man managing household 
affairs ; as a planter looking after crops, cattle, 
and overseers ; and as a business man driving

bargains, sueing for bad debts, collecting rents, 
and making investments. The material of the 
volume is in three divisions : first are the letters 
of Washington to his Secretary, Tobias Lear, 
relating to domestic affairs at Philadelphia and 
Mt, Vernon ; next is reprinted in full Lear's 
account of the last illness and death of Wash- 
ington, the funeral and after ; third are mis- 
cellaneous letters of Washington relating to 
domestic and agricidtural affairs at Mt. Vernon 
after 1790. There is a brief introduction by 
Louisa Lear Eyre, granddaughter of Tobias, 
which tells us that she has a Martha Washing- 
ton quUt, a Tobias Lear portrait, and a Greorge 
Washington lock of hair, and that she " was 
defraude<l of the originals of these letters." 
There is no further explanation of the last state- 
ment. The Lear correspondence given is from 
copies made by Lincoln Lear, son of Tobias, for 
Jared Sparks, who later gave the copies to Miss 
Louisa Lear, daughter of Lincoln Lear. Some 
of the letters have not been printed before. Of 
editing there is practically none ; and to the lack 
of it, as well as to careless proof-reading, is due 
the perpetuation of the copyist's misreadings of 
Washington's spelling — such as " over par " 
for overseer, " Molly " for Nellie, " Curtis " for 
Custis, etc. And surely there is something 
wrong where Lear's figures make Washington's 
length after death only five feet three and a 
half inches. A foot more will be necessary to 
satisfy the popular notion of the tall first Presi- 
dent. The reviewer has been unable to find 
anything in the book that will justify the word 
" Recollections " in the title. There is no index. 
The letters are filled with facts about the 
servants, the slaves, the household economy ; 
schools for young relatives ; crops, fertilizers, 
seeds, cattle, horses, sheep, overseers, soils, farm 
implements ; rents, investments, land sales, and 
all that interested a progressive farmer of a 
century ago. Some of them certainly make the 
Father of his Country seem very human and 
un-heroic, and dim the halo that Parson Weems 
and others have created for us. For instance, 
no housekeeper of to-day faces a more trouble- 
some servant problem than did George Wash- 
ington during the last ten years of his life. It 
seems that he preferred white servants who were 
honest, frugal, neat, and did not drink ; but 
these were hard to get, and were always wanting 
their wages raised. He refused to bring two 
kitchen servants from New York to Philadelphia 
because they were not neat enough, and the 
" kitchen [being] in full \4ew of the best rooms." 
The steward's accounts are criticised, and Wash-

ington declares that "it is inconceivable to me 
how other families on 25 hd. or 3,000 dollars 
should be enabled to entertain more company 
. . . than I coidd do for 25,000 dollars annu- 
ally." He comes to the conclusion that it is 
partly on account of the expense of the " Sec- 
ond " or white servants' table. " I strongly 
suspect that nothing is brought to my Table of 
liquors^ fruits, and other things, that is not 
used as profusely [at the servants' table]." And 
to Lear, when engaging servants for the Phila- 
delphia establishment, he wrote, " Be him or 
them whom they may, it must be expressly un- 
derstood that wine is not permissable at their 
Table." Even while President he looked after 
the negroes' clothes, bought their caps, chose 
the wall-paper and carpets, saw to the proper 
placing of the furniture and ornaments in every 
room, looked after the wood supply, engaged 
washerwomen, traded laundry implements and 
furniture with Mrs. Kobert Morris, ordered 
preserves and butter put up for winter, and per- 
formed numerous other duties that we think 
Mrs. Washington might have claimed as her own. 
Either he was a meddler, or he deserved the title 
of "George Washington, Housekeeper." 

Nothing is clearer than the double fact that 
Washington liked neither slavery nor slaves. 
He was careful of the comfort of his servants, 
as he called them, was kind to them, and enclosed 
with his own their love-letters to their " delto- 
bosos "; but he had lived long enough in the 
North to see the advantage of a homogeneous 
white population, and to the end of his days he 
hoped to get rid of his slaves and get English 
and Scotch farmers in place of them. To a 
friend he wrote : " I do not like even to think, 
much less to talk, of [slave property] .... 
Were it not that I am principled against selling- 
negroes as you would do cattle at a market, I 
would not in twelve months ... be possessed 
of one " . . . " but imperious necessity compels 
. . . until I can substitute some other expe- 
dient." 

Perhaps of most interest and value are the 
letters to overseers and others regarding farm 
management. Washington was not a planter, 
but a farmer; Mt. Vernon was not a planta- 
tion but a congeries of small farms. Hence 
the labor system was not well organized, and 
Washington had much difficidty in keeping 
things in running order. He complains of 
indolent negro labor, stupid overseers, " worth- 
less white men " who have " no more authority 
over the Negroes . . . than an old woman 
would have." Yet when he was able to give 



personal attention to his farms, all went well, — 
crojDS were good, cattle were improved, the wool 
production doubled, etc. He believed in the 
modern methods of intensive farming, and was 
convinced " that if we were to reduce our culti- 
vation ... to half the present quantity, and 
manure and till that half well, our profits would 
be greater." In engaging a manager to look 
after Mt. Vernon while he was in Philadelphia, 
Washington wrote : 

" As I am never sparing in furnishing my Farms with 
any and every kind of Tool and Implement that is cal- 
culated to do good and neat work, I not only authorize 
you to bring the kind of ploughs you were speaking to 
me about, but any others, the utility of which you have 
proved from your own experience. ... I shall begrudge 
no reasonable expense that will contribute to the im- 
provement and neatness of my Farms : — for nothing 
pleases me better than to see them in good order, and 
everything trim, handsome, and thriving . . . nor noth- 
ing hurts me more than to find them otherwise, and the 
tools and implements laying where they were last used, 
exposed to injuries from Rain, sim, etc." 

This was his farmer's platform, and it explains 
how he was able to live from the proceeds of his 
farms and yet serve his country without pay for 
long periods of time. But evidently there were 
many who were not up to his standard ; for when, 
in 1790, he wanted to lease the Mt. Vernon 
place, he refused " to do it to the slovenly farmers 
of this Country," and later, when he wanted to 
sell land, he tried to get English and Scotch 
farmers to buy, " for I have no idea of fritter- 
ing up farms for the accommodation of our coun- 
try farmers whose knowledge centres in the 
destruction of land and very little beyond it." 

We learn that he gave children lottery tickets, 
and that he had a distillery ; that he could write 
a scorching dun to a bad debtor ; that he believed 
in strict discipline over school-children, and that 
in enquiring about a school he asked first about 
the discipline and the master, next if the pupils 
were " genteel," and finally and incidentally, 
" Among other things enquire what is taught at 
these schools." There are many other interest- 
ing and homely facts in these letters which throw 
a new light on Washington, and in a way help 
to bring him down from the heights to earth 
again — to the earth where he certainly liked to 
live. Walter L. Fleming.

The Eastern Course of Conquest.* 

From the time of Caesar, one of the favorite 
methods of conquest has been the subjection of 
savage and semi-civilized races under the plea 
of pacifying and protecting them. From the 
negative position of protection it is only a step 
to positive direct control. We see much of this 
method of conquest in our own time. One of 
the best examples is probably the gro\vth of 
Russian authority over Central Asia. Another 
good illustration in the making is the British 
frontier protectorate over Afghanistan. It is in 
this regdon of Central Asia that we are now 
beholding the subtle and fascinatrng game of 
diplomacy most cimningly played. Russia, de- 
feated in the Far East, must now return to her 
former field of conquests to extend her powers 
and to recuperate her losses. England, recog- 
nizing this advance of Russia southward, must 
now zealously guard her protectorate over Af- 
ghanistan, that no direct attack may be made 
on her Indian possessions. The diplomatic re- 
lations are involved, the conditions are intricate, 
and the outcome is not at all certain. 

To understand the circumstances and condi- 
tions, the temper and chai-acter, of these Afghans 
requires an intimate knowledge of every point 
involved in such a complicated political, geo- 
graphical, and historical situation. Few stu- 
dents of Central Asian affairs know aU these 
conditions so well as does Mr. Angus Hamilton, 
author of a notable book on Korea, and for some 
time a correspondent of the " PaU Mall Gazette " 
from Central Asia His volume on Afghanistan, 
like that on Korea, is heavy, but it is substan- 
tial and instructive reading. He marshals an 
astonishing array of data on the commercial and 
political affairs of that country, but out of the 
dry material thus offered he makes an able di- 
gest and conclusion of present conditions that 
are interesting to the student of geography, 
politics, and trade, in that part of Asia. Above 
all things, liis volume is pregnant with ideas 
concerning the conflict between Russia and En- 
gland for prestige in Central Asia. 

Of primary importance in either the subjec- 
tion or the protection of Afghanistan is the rail- 
way. The Orenbiu-g-Tashkend Railway, which 
has been but recently completed, now reduces 
the pre%aoiis long journey from St. Petersburg 
to Tashkend to the small matter of twentj'-four 
hundred miles, thus making a close jointure 
between the military and commercial depots, 
between the capital and the frontier. A further

study of this system shows that it is possible to 
connect Merv, the terminus of the Murgab Valley 
division, with the Indian system of railways at 
New Cliaman, by the way of Herat in the west 
and Kandahar m the south, thereby lessening 
the travelling distance between England and 
India by seven days' journey. There is no 
probability, however, that this scheme will be- 
come a reality. Russia will not consent to the 
building of a line which will so much profit her 
enemy. Russia's policy, according to Mr. Ham- 
ilton, wiU be to extend the Tashkend road along 
the northern Persian and the northern Afghan 
borders in order to control the military and 
trade conditions of those strong strategical posi- 
tions. It is Russia's pui'pose, undoubtedly, to 
extend the system to Herat, the key to India, 
on the western border. Such a line, once estab- 
lished, would give Russia the advantage in the 
event of an outbreak of hostilities. 

At Kandahar and the southern border of 
Afghanistan, the question of railway building 
is also the chief political concern of England. 
Kandahar is of more importance as a trade 
centre than Herat, and is of almost equal im- 
portance in sti-ategical position. At present 
the British position in southern Afghanistan is 
en V air, but a railway from Kandahar to New 
Chaman in India would link Afghanistan to 
India in a more tangible way. It seems likely 
that such a line will be established before long. 
British interests, while favoring this short line, 
are inimical to a trans- Afghan system ; for in 
order to preserve the integrity of the state it 
is necessary that Afghanistan shall remain a 
buffer state, whereas a trans-Afghan railroad 
would make her a gateway to India. 

So runs the story of the whole book. Were 
we to summarize Mr. Hamilton's account of 
every district of Afghanistan, we should only 
repeat what we have said about Herat and Kan- 
dahar — the importance of the railway problem, 
and the admonition regarding Russia's advance. 
Mr. Hamilton's whole thought and tone is 
summed up in the following quotations from 
his book : 

" Russia is really the supreme and dominating factor 
in Afghanistan, not only along the northern, eastern and 
western frontiers, but throughout the kingdom." 

"The policy of this country [England] should be 
mistrustful of Russia always, and our attitude should 
be actively suspicious." 

The i^essimistic views of the author are pro- 
bably accentuated by two further facts revealed 
in the latter part of his book — the failure of 
Sir Louis Dane's ^lission to make a favorable 
I treaty with the Afghan powers, and the insta-

bility of the weak-willed ruler of Afghanistan, 
Amir Habib Ullah. Like the men in the nur- 
sery rhyme who marched up the hill and then 
marched down again, the Dane Mission return- 
ing from Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, 
had to report meekly that the Amir had been 
elevated to the height of an Independent King, 
that he was permitted to import arms at his 
pleasure, and that his government was to be 
released from the arrears which had accumulated 
in the Indian treasury. As an offset for these 
concessions, the Mission reported that the Amir 
was disaffected and untrustworthy ! Mr. Hamil- 
ton is gracious enough to think, however, that 
this affront was due more to the conspicuous 
vanity of the Amir than to the manifestation of 
his ill-will. And herein lies the promise of 
trouble for Afghanistan. As a man and ruler, 
the Amir is so strongly marked by a capricious 
temper and a weak will that his seat on the 
throne is not at all secure. Surrounded by 
an all-powerful priesthood opposed to foreign 
advice ; intrigued against by relations, both 
masculine and feminine, who, led by his strong- 
willed brother, Nasr Ullah Khan, are waiting 
for a propitious moment to overthrow him ; 
unbeloved, although amiable in disposition, by 
his subjects, he may at any time become the 
centre of a rebellion. Then wiU be the moment 
for active hostilities between Russia and England. 
The volume is dedicated to the late Viceroy 
of India, Lord Curzon, whose knowledge of 
Central Asian affairs is unsurpassed. All the 
helpful means for understanding the text, such 
as illustrations, maps, tables, appendices, are 
abundantly provided. At times, however, when 
our interest is aroused by some picture it remains 
unsatisfied so far as any comment in the text is 
concerned. But then, Mr. Hamilton's view- 
point is not often that of picturesqueness.

chiefly occupied with the puritan settlement of New 
England. Mr. Andrew Macphail is the author, and 
the story is something more than readable, although 
it is long-winded throughout and drags not a little 
toward the end. The hero is one Nicholas Dexter, 
a valiant captain under Cromwell, and, when the 
story opens on the eve of the Restoration, a fugitive 
from the vengeance of the King. Escaping from 
England with the connivance of a daring sea-dog 
named Phineas Pratt, he seeks a home in Boston ; 
hut, finding the theological atmosphere of the Bay 
too stifling to breathe, he soon again becomes a 
wanderer. The particular object of his quest is 
a maiden whom he had rescued when she was but a 
child, and whom he now seeks as a lover. Her 
fortunes have been no less chequered than his, and 
the pursuit leads him a merry chase from Boston to 
the Bahamas, and thence again through Boston 
to the northern wUderness. Of course she is 
found at last, and she turns out to be the long-lost 
daughter of Phineas Pratt. Mr. Macphail knows 
something of the early history of the Bay, but his 
knowledge is far from accurate, and a critic of the 
more microscopic sort might pick many flaws in his 
narrative. 

Mr. Warwick Deeping, is to be warmly congratu- 
lated upon his latest story, which he has entitled 
"Bess of the Woods." It is a story of country life 
in England, dated in the latter half of the eighteenth 
century, and accomplishes the difficult feat of pre- 
senting that period in romantic coloring, while 
remaining faithful to its artificial speech and its 
social usages. Gentlefolk and rustics are alike de- 
lineated with truth and sympathy, and in the contrast 
between these two groups, brought into close relations 
by the hero's romance, the author finds one of his best 
artistic effects. We have, on the one hand, besides 
the hero, his delightfully cynical and selfish aunt, who 
is a seasoned campaigner, and the baronet his neigh- 
bor, whose family includes a swaggering son and a 
shrewish daughter of more summers than she would 
willingly acknowledge. This young woman marks 
the hero for her own, and he becomes so entangled 
in his own strained notions of honor that he is well 
nigh victimized, being saved, however, by an infusion 
of good sense which results from certain interviews 
with his malicious but clear-sighted aunt. On the 
other hand, deep in the neighboring forest there lives 
a small community of peasants, whose chief occu- 
pation is smuggling, and among them the heroine, 
who is believed to be of their blood, but who has in 
reality been left in their hands as a child after a grim

scene of murder and robbery committed many years 
before. She is, in fact, another Lorna Doone, and 
the patriarchal government of the clan is rather 
closely patterned after that of Blackmore's famous 
nest of outlaws. How hero and heroine meet, how 
they heed the voices of their hearts, with what machi- 
nations of craft and villainy they are compassed 
about, and with what triumph they finally escape 
from the toils, are the matters set forth in this ex- 
tremely interesting, well-written, and artistically- 
framed romance, which has not had many equals 
in the fiction of recent years. 

" In Desert Keeping," by Mr. Edmund Mitchell, 
is the story of a secret murder which the desert does 
not, however, keep very long, and which when dis- 
closed brings about a pretty complication. The victim 
has been, in days long past, the lover of his slayer's 
wife ; and it is their son who discovers the secret of 
the crime, believing all the time that the slayer and 
not the slain is his father. The son, being the legatee 
of the dead man's fortune, is charged with compli- 
city in the crime, which keeps the reader in a con- 
dition of tense excitement for quite a while. It is 
a, rather poor story, on the whole, but not without 
some slight merits of characterization and plot. 

Mr. Filson Young, who under the name of " Guy 
Thorne " will be remembered as the author of the 
rather crude and sensational novel " When It Was 
Dark," has given us in " The Sands of Pleasure " a 
far more acceptable and serious work. Its hero is 
an engineer by profession, and the first section of 
the novel presents him occupied with the task of con- 
structing a lighthouse on the Cornish coast. There 
is much display of technical information in this de- 
scription, but it is discreetly handled, and the picture 
of the struggle with the sea is singularly impres- 
sive. When his work is practically over, the hero 
goes to Paris for relaxation, and for the first time 
in his life comes into contact with the world of 
pleasure-seeking and sordid vice. This second sec- 
tion of the work thus deals with debatable matter, 
and with a frankness hitherto almost unexampled 
in English fiction; but we are g^ven fair warning 
of what is to come, and the author's defence of his 
course is not without weight. " It is obviously im- 
possible," he says, " that everyone should know the 
half-world at first-hand : but there is every reason 
why mature people should read about it, not bitterly 
or unpleasantly, but as pleasantly as possible, in the 
mirror of a page written without moral preoccupa- 
tions." So Mr. Filson's heroine (as far as the book 
has one) is a demi-mnndaine, a creature of delicate 
and elusive charm who captivates for a time the 
senses of the hero, yet who is not portrayed with the 
artificial sentimentality of " La Dame aux Camel- 
lias," but is presented in a light clear enough to 
illuminate the ugliness of her life no less than its 
attractive aspects. We may hardly quarrel with a 
writer who so conscientiously aims at artistic truth, 
however much he may startle us by the boldness of 
his treatment. In the third section of the book, the 



hero, his infatuation brought under control, is ag^in 
found at the scene of his labors, the difficult process 
of regeneration at work within his soul. The episode 
of a visit to a Trappist monaster^' contributes notably 
both to his strenghtening and to the impressiveness 
of the book's implied teaching. It is not a book for 
the young to read, but it is one that will work no 
harm to mature and balanced minds. 

Madame Emma M agdalena Rosalia Maria Josef a 
Barbara, Baroness Orczy, has given us, in " A Son 
of the People," a deeply interesting romance of the 
Alfdld, or great Hungarian plain. The peasant and 
the magnate's daughter provide the romance, which 
is worked out upon a familiar plan. The magnate 
has impoverished himself by agi-icultural experiments 
and a reckless scale of living ; his estates are heavily 
mortgaged, and the rich peasant becomes his princi- 
pal creditor. The latter has long worshipped the 
magnate's daughter from afar, and proposes to relieve 
the financial situation by making her his wife. This 
sordid arrangement is effected, and the wedding 
takes place. But the aristocratic heroine, scorning 
her base-born husband, overwhelms him with her 
contempt, and he makes no effort to keep her at his 
side. Eventually, however, the nobility of his char- 
acter is revealed to her, and her scorn dissolves in 
the love which she has long half-consciously felt for 
him, thus bring the tale to a happy ending. It is a 
strong and attractive piece of work, vivid in descrip- 
tion and characterization^ dramatic in action. Depict- 
ing the kind of life with which the romances of Jokai 
have make us fairly familiar, it has in some respects 
an advantage over those fantastic inventions. At 
least, it conforms more closely than they to the 
accepted European ideals of orderly movement and 
logical structure, while sacrificing nothing of their 
intensely national character. 

" The Man from America," by Mrs. Henry de la 
Pasture, is described as '* a sentimental comedy." It 
is a story without a problem or a purpose, as these 
terms are used by the strenuous modem novelist, 
but simply a charming study of some young people 
of Devonshire, with an ancient expatriated French- 
man and a few visiting Americans thrown in for 
variety. It is decidedly pleasant to be in the society 
of the old Frenchman and of the two grand-daughters 
upon whom his affection is lavished. The book's 
chief excuse for being is that it affords us this plea- 
sure ; the fact that the story is all the time slowly 
leading up to a series of happy and reasonably roman- 
tic marriages is only a secondary consideration. 
That the work is fresh, human, and altogether de- 
lightful, must be the verdict of every reader. 

We expect work of verj' high character from Mrs, 
Margaret Woods, and '• The King's Revoke " does 
not disappoint us. This " episode in the life of 
Patrick DUlon " bears the date of 1808, and is con- 
cerned with the efforts of the young Irishman, in 
the service of the Spanish royalists, to rescue the 
young King from captivitj' in the hands of Napoleon.

time-serving afrancesados, and the English army is 
pounding away at the ramparts of his kingdom. 
Meanwhile, Ferdinand the Desired, to whom the 
mass of the Spanish nation are passionately attached, 
lives in enforced seclusion in Touraine, a guest at 
Talleyrand's chateau. He proves a most unheroic 
hero, for when the plot for his liberation is at the 
point of successful issue, he sets the plans of the 
conspirators at naught by refusing to hazard his 
precious skin, hoping that in the end the imperial 
French usurper will prove his most useful friend. 
The conspiracy which thus ends in failure is both 
ingenious and intricate — rather too much so to be 
altogether intelligible. The main part of the ro- 
mance has its scene in Touraine, and introduces us 
to a mixed and interesting society of English dete- 
nus, Spanish nobles, and Frenchmen of various 
ranks. Young Dillon cuts a dashing but not always 
dignified figure in the plot, and his shady accom- 
plice. Count d'Haguerty, provides an interesting 
study in character. One figure, that of the beau- 
tiful and high-souled Marquesa de Santa Coloma, 
stands out above all the others upon this crowded 
canvas. 

"The Day's Journey," by Miss Netta Syrett, is 
an old story tricked out in modern habiliments. Its 
garb of speech and incident is so extremely modern 
that we are apt to forget how old the story is in all 
its essentials. When it opens, the hero and the hero- 
ine have been married for five years, and the dream 
of love has given place to the grey consciousness of 
a lost illusion. The man has become wearied of do- 
mesticity, and is seeking for distraction elsewhere. 
The woman thus neglected has at last, after much 
silent suffering, ceased to care greatly for anything. 
Then the opportune reappearance of an old-time 
lover restores something of her interest in life, and 
and her youth and beauty burst once more into 
bloom. She separates herself from her husband, who 
then begins to realize what she has been to him, 
while at the same time he discovers how insincere 
and self-seeking is the character of the other woman 
who has been the cause of his infidelity. Eventually 
his wife takes pity upon him, and a soi"t of recon- 
ciliation follows, bringing the book to a close. This 
complex situation is handled with delicacy through- 
out, and the whole story is told in a crisp style which 
never drags and which is always charming. 

A sentimentalized " literary " description of the 
Fifth Symphony, by Dr. Henry van Dyke, serves 
as prelude to " Where Speech Ends," a novel by 
Mr. Robert Haven Schauffier. It is a musical novel, 
as this title and this fact indicate ; but the reader 
need not be apprehensive. There is no vague rhap- 
sodizing in its pages ; the hero is not a romantic 
tenor, and the heroine is not a moon-struck damsel. 
Nor is there any attempt to represent the artist as 
an unbalanced and irresponsible creature, whose 
genius is a sufficient excuse for his moral aberra- 
tions. On the contrary, the gi'oup of musicians with 
which the story is concerned are essentially normal 



human beings, having their little eccentricities, no 
doubt, but on the whole very much like other people. 
The writer seems to understand, moreover, that music 
is an art having real relations to life. Says the 
Princetonian who follows his bent and becomes a 
fiddler : " My chums on the campus call me hard- 
hearted and disloyal, and say I don't love the old 
university properly. They can't know, of course, 
that the orchestra is the most deeply sociable insti- 
tution going ; they can't conceive the ecstasy of 
joining with a hundred kindred musicians and a 
thousand kindred hearers in that very apotheosis of 
the brotherhood of man, the Ninth Symphony." 
The characters in this book are for the most part 
members of the Chicago Orchestra. This statement 
must not be taken too literally, for the figure of old 
Wolfgang is hardly to be taken as a portrait of 
the late Theodore Thomas, despite a few realistic 
touches. But the scene is Chicago, with the definite 
naming of localities, and even the recognizable de- 
scription of personalities. The Avriter has a keen 
faculty of humorous observation, which may be illus- 
trated by this thumb-nail sketch of the old kettle- 
drummer at the festive board : •' At his food Loewen 
was always a pleasing and curious spectacle. He 
had done military service in his youth, and four 
times a day his early training cropped up in him. 
He was always militant at his meals. Before attack- 
ing a roll his face would take on an invincible expres- 
sion. Then the resolute jaws would bury themselves 
in it and one could see the dozens of valiant little 
wrinkles that would scale the cheeks and lodge about 
the discolored temples. He handled a knife like a 
sabre, a fork like a bayonet, and his infrequent 
operations with a finger-bowl partook of the nature 
of ablutions before inspection." There is pathos, 
too, in the book, of a sincere and appealing kind. 
The plot is unimportant, although it gives us a hero 
(or possibly two ) and a heroine, with a villain whose 
machinations keep the lovers apart for a time. But 
the story is essentially one of incidents, loosely strung 
together, charming in their freshness, and intimate 
in their revelation of the musician's every -day life. 
It makes reading of an altogether wholesome and 
delightful sort. 

" Buchanan's Wife," by Mr. Justus Miles Forman, 
is the story of a woman who has married for money, 
and whose husband, a man of moody and occasion- 
ally vicious temper, makes her life unbearable. 
Matters are further complicated by the existence of 
the man whom she ought to have married. Presently 
Buchanan disappears mysterously, and long after- 
wards a body is discovered which the wife identifies 
as that of her lost but not mourned consort. Then 
she man-ies her lover. But the fact is that she has 
lied in identifying the corpse, and presently Buchanan 
turns up in the form of a consumptive tramp, who 
has forgotten the facts of his former life, although 
haunted by intangible fancies, which become danger- 
ously vivid when he is brought once more into the 
old familiar environment. The terrified wife tries

to conceal the fact of his existence, but her second 
husband finds it out. Then follows an exciting scene 
in which the real husband dies, the nominal husband 
barely escapes with his life, and the blackmailing 
villain is torn to pieces by an infuriated dog. Thus 
ends a preposterous yarn which has little power to 
arouse sympathy, and which depends for its effects 
upon trickiness and crude melodrama. 

Mr. Hopkinson Smith's new novel strikes a deeper 
note, and is altogether of more serious quality than 
most of his productions. It is a story of a New 
England coast town, with a light-house and a life- 
saving station, both of which adjuncts are effectively 
used in its development. It is thus, to a consider- 
able extent, an open-air story, with effects of storm 
and sunlight that the author knows how to put to 
picturesque uses. Essentially, however, it is the life- 
history of two sisters, one of whom is a selfish 
worldling, a girl who lapses from virtue, and success- 
fully, until near the end, conceals her misdoing. This 
concealment is made possible by the devotion of the 
other, who sacrifices happiness and even good repute 
in the endeavor to save the erring sister's name from 
stain. The book is one of much simple strength and 
human sympathy. 

Mr. Chambers has many admirable qualities as a 
novelist, and his work is always interesting, but the 
novel of character is not his affair. Consequently, 
the praise which is justly due his romantic inven- 
tions ( even the most fantastical of them ) and his 
fictions having a historical framework must be re- 
luctantly withheld from "'The Fighting Chance," 
which is a story of the idle rich in their favorite 
haunts. Here is a book without a single character 
who has ever done anything to justify his existence, 
without a worthy ideal of any kind to bestow upon 
it a genuine human interest. Of course there is a 
brave pretence of depicting this seamy phase of our 
society in such a light as to expose its snobbishness 
and corruption, but we cannot feel that the exposure 
is made in full sincerity. We have all the time a 
consciousness that the writer is quite as much con- 
cerned to show how intimately he knows the life of 
"the smart set" as he is to hold it up for reproba- 
tion. Even the novels of Mi-s. Wharton and Mrs. 
Ward give us something of this feeling, and the 
present work impresses it still more strongly upon 
us. The lieroine is another Lily Bart, and the final 
triumph of love over worldliness in her case is rather 
a concession to romantic sentiment than the revela- 
tion of anything particularly admirable in her 
character. The hero is a semi-reformed drunkard 
whom the author's best efforts cannot succeed in 
making otherwise than superficially attractive. Such 
books as this play with the glittering surface of life, 
but have nothing to do with its deeper realities. If 
Mr. Chambers is well-advised he will return, after 
this unfortunate experiment, to his metier as a 
writer of historical romance and interpreter of the 

poetry of nature. -„r nr t.

„, ,. ... Professor Maior's "First Steps in 

studies in the , /-, , ■«, .n 

mental growth Mental Grrowth (Macmillan) is 
of a little child, mainly a record of observations upon 
his own eldest son during the first three years of 
life. It is true, as the author says, that " one can- 
not undertake the arrangement of material of this 
kind without thinking about it," and in consequence 
more or less interpretation has been included. It is 
hard to say whether more data or more interpreta- 
tion is the greater need of child-study just now ; 
probably both must advance together. Until we have 
more trustworthy facts, theorizing is hazardous ; and 
yet until we have some more definite lines of hypoth- 
esis the task of the observer is a blind one. So we 
may welcome all such work as this of Professor 
Major's, giving us the benefit of the observation of 
a trained psychologist at close range with his infant 
subject. We cannot, indeed, have too many such 
records. The author is in general remarkably sane 
and conservative in his inferences, and seems always 
on his guard against asserting the inner psychic 
event upon any but convincing evidence. He often 
takes the attitude expressed by his words on page 
197 : " But reflection will show that the case is not 
quite so clear as seems at first sight." Only by such 
vigilant caution may the psychologist hope to escape 
reading into the psychic state what is not there at 
all. The old ambiguity as to Imitation crops out 
in Chapter V. " The idea of a movement," we axe 
told, " is already the beginning of that movement.'* 
True enough ; but in the subsequent discussion it 
is not always remembered that it is the idea of a. 
movement in oneself, and not the vision or image 
of a movement in another, that is the beginning of 
the movement. The refusal of the child to " imitate " 
various simple and apparently tempting acts (p. 129) 
is easily explained on this basis ; seeing the father 
clapping his hands produces an idea of a movement, 
it is true, but no immediately dynamic or ideomotor 
idea. The most serious lack in the book seems to 
us to be the neglect of the will. Mere physical con- 
trol is treated, of course, in the chapters on move- 
ments, drawing, imitation, play, language ; but the 
beginnings of ethical control are slighted. Nor ia 
this book alone in this regard, but in general little 
attention has been given by the psychologists of 
childhood to the origin and development of the dis- 
position and the habitual moral attitude, especially 
such matters as habits of obedience and disobedience, 
cheerfulness, activity, affection, and the like. On the 
whole. Professor Major's book is one of the safest 
and most fruitful of its class.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



R. H. Hutton's trenchant and vigorous book-notices, 
in Ainger's gentle and genial literary appreciations, 
and in Mr. Herbert Paul's able and scholarly sur- 
veys of current noteworthy publications. The vol- 
ume entitled " Stray Leaves " (Lane) comprises ten 
essays contributed by Mr. Paul to " The Nineteenth 
Century" and "The Independent Review," six of 
them being criticisms of books, one a chapter in 
praise of Peacock's novels, one a strong plea for 
Greek but not for its compiUsory study, still another 
having to do with " The Religion of the Greeks " — 
being suggested by Miss Jane Harrison's "Prole- 
gomena to the Study of Greek Religion" — and 
finally, though first in the order of position, a eulo- 
gistic sketch of the late Bishop Creighton. Jour- 
nalism is dignified by such pens as Mr. Paul's — 
none too numerous, unfortunately. Biography, and 
history too, have received no mean contributions 
from his scholarship and energy. In the present 
volume of miscellanies there is something ingratia- 
ting in the way he disclaims all erudition in Greek 
language and literatm-e, and then goes on to show 
a great deal of curious and special knowledge in 
matters relating to his theme, as in the Greek schol- 
arship of English writers from Bentley to Brown- 
ing. He has no fear that Greek literature will fall 
into neglect unless the study of it be kept up by 
compulsion. Here he sounds a brave note. But he 
sadly errs in declaring very roundly that " the study 
of Greek is time thrown away unless it results in a 
familiarity with the style and idiom of the Greek 
writers from Homer to Theocritus, at least equal 
to an educated Englishman's acquaintance with 
French." Must we easy-going scholars, who delight 
to sit down with our " Iliad " in one hand and our 
"Autenrieth" in the other, believe that we are 
wasting our time, and that we might as well be 
reading Pope's epic of the same name ? No, indeed. 
FitzGerald loved the very lexicon he thumbed so 
thoroughly in reading his favorite "Don" in the 
original Spanish. Cannot we too get a smack of the 
true Homeric flavor by aid of grammar and dic- 
tionary? Nay, more, is there a Greek scholar in 
all England, or in all Europe, who can read a tragedy 
of iEschylus as easily and as rapidly as a tragedy 
of Corneille or Racine? Apart from this absurd 
notion as to the uselessness of a little Greek, Mr. 
Paul has written a good book. 

Man does not live by bread alone ; 
and the spicing or the garnish or the 
relish that makes his diet palatable 
and even sustaining is furnished by the imagination 
that both guides and vivifies the steps of his intel- 
lect. Inspiration at the highest, originality or in- 
itiative at the simplest, puts the cutting edge on our 
faculties and shapes our several achievements to their 
several ends. To fathom the inner nature of this 
phase of human endowment has ever been an allur- 
ing and ever will remain a legitimate problem in 
the psychologist's programme. Professor Ribot, well 
known for his interesting popularizations in diverse

fields of the mental domain, has focussed his ma- 
terials and his methods upon the task of presenting 
the role of the imagination in the intellectual en- 
deavor ; and the essay has tempted the translator 
to render accessible the data to English readers in 
a volume entitled "The Creative Imagination " (The 
Open Court Publishing Co.) The analysis, the de- 
velopment, and the types of this faculty occupy the 
serial enfoldment of the tale, and afford some insight 
into the sorts and conditions of its manifestations, 
from the myth-making tendencies of primitive man 
to the discerning and daring guesses of the well- 
equipped latter-day worker in science. The current of 
the analysis never runs very deep ; and a great mass 
of interesting and pertinent detail is lightly touched 
upon and well marshalled, — quite enough to suggest 
that a more serious voyage of discovery along the 
same stream would be variously profitable. Yet 
the excursion fairly well meets its purposes, and 
offers suitable guidance to the average, or more than 
average, excursionist ; though it suggests, as trans- 
lations commonly do, that an independent tour de- 
signed to meet the precise needs and modes of 
travel of the Anglo-Saxon mind would be yet more 
successful. As a manual to a region well worthy of 
exploration, the volume may be recommended both 
in the original and in the present form. The psycho- 
logist welcomes such aids to the comprehension of 
his purposes, though he regrets that they so largely 
replace, rather than summarise, the more important 
records of the advancement of his pursuit.

This ancient province, with its forbidding coast 
tortured into a thousand fantastic shapes, its wild 
hilly inland districts, with their foaming torrents, 
streams, and rivulets, its barren wind-swept moors 
and heaths, with their ponds and marshes, is essen- 
tially different from the rest of France. The Britons, 
moreover, have ever kept themselves a race apart, 
intermarrying as a general rule amongst themselves 
only, speaking their own language, now broken up 
into several dialects, and clinging with almost pa- 
thetic devotion to traditions and customs long since 
abandoned elsewhere. In the opinion of many 
scholars, it was amongst the glades and oak-groves 
of the primeval forests of Brittany that was first 
evolved the Arthurian romance that has exercised so 
great an influence over modern literature and art. 
King Arthur himself, the greater number of his 
knights, the mighty enchanter Merlin and the fair 
Vivien who wrought his ruin, are all supposed to 
have been of Briton birth ; and not so very long 
ago any presumptuous skeptic who should have 
dared, in certain districts of Brittany, to scoff at the 
legend of the Holy Grail, would have been in dan- 
ger of rough treatment at the hands of the natives. 
In fact, the Britons still retain the poetic imagina- 
tion of childhood ; they live in an ideal world of 
their own, and are proud of the limitations which

The hittorv ^^" ^^^ Lelaud Ha worth's book on 

ofafamou* "The Disputed Hayes-Tilden Elec- 

duputed election. ^:^Q^ of 1876" ( BiUTows Brothers) 
is the first adequate history of '• the most memorable 
electoi-al controversy in the history of popular govern- 
ment." Thii'ty years have passed since this remark- 
able contest ; the chief candidates, most of the party 
managers, and all but two of the members of the 
Electoral Commission are dead, and most Americans 
have no personal recollection of the events described. 
Mr. Haworth is therefore correct in believing that 
the time has come when its history may be written 
impartially, and judgment passed without prejudice. 
The book bears evidence of painstaking research and 
study. Besides more than 20,000 pages of Congres- 
sional docimientary evidence, the author has drawn 
his material from a variety of other sources, and has 
personally interviewed the more prominent survivors 
who figiu-ed in the controversy. He reviews the 
political situation at the close of the Reconstruction 
Perio<l, and describes the demoralization which 
brought about the revolt in the ranks of the Repub- 
lican party and culminated in the Democratic 
triumphs of 1874 and 1876. He discusses in detail 
the violence and intimidation which marked the 
elections of 1876 in Florida, South Carolina, and 
Louisiana ; draws a vivid picture of the excitement 
and intense strain which followed ; summarizes the 
constitutional provisions for counting the electoral 
votes ; reviews the precedents regarding the electoral 
count, and discusses the various schemes proposed 
by both parties for settling the controversy, the crea- 
tion of the Electoral Commission, and the pi-ocesses 
by which it reached a decision. Mr. Haworth's own 
judgment is that many regrettable things were done 
by both parties, but that the desperation to which the 
people of the South had been driven by the long 
period of misgovernment serves in a measure to 
palliate the violence and intimidation which they 
practised in order to carry the elections. This vio- 
lence and intimidation was mUd in most cases, 
although in some instances it was horrible beyond 
belief. Had there been a fair election, he asserts, 
in the disputed states, there is every reason to believe 
that all would have returned substantial majorities 
for Hayes, and that the Republican returning board, 
under the pressure of " visiting statesmen " from the 



North, were guilty of the most irr^nlar practices in 
throwing out votes to secure the election of a ticket 
which would have been successfid with a fair and 
free vote. The act creating the Electoral Commission, 
he asserts, was, without a shadow of a doubt, one of 
the wisest pieces of statecraft ever evolved by an 
American Congress ; the procedure and decision of 
the Conmiission on all the points before it was con- 
sistent and in accord with the law. and the American 
people ratified the decision by electing one of its 
members (Grarfield) President.

Mr. John Fj'vie's well printed and illustrated com- 
pilation entitled '• Some Literarj- Eccentrics " (James 
Pott & Co.) has characteristics of the first two classes, 
and is not wholly free from those of the last. The 
opening chapter treats of a forgotten eighteenth- 
centurj* author highly commended by so distinguished 
a critic as Hazlitt. Thomas Amor^', whose chief 
work was that strange hodge-podge of a novel called 
"John Buncle." is styled by Hazlitt the English 
Rabelais, as Mr. Fj-vie takes occasion to remind us. 
In a later chapter, Hazlitt himself comes in for con- 
sideration as one of the eccentrics, which may seem 
the more natural and fitting after his hyperbolic 
praise of Amory. The author, in recording the visit 
of Hazlitt's father to America, saj^s that " he founded 
the first Unitarian church in Boston, after the con- 
clusion of the war, in 1783." But, if accuracy here 
is worth while, "The Monthly Repository," Vol. III., 
page 305, informs us that this dissenting minister 
arrived in Boston May 1.5, 1784; and that he so 
used his influence, especially by publishing a tract 
in confutation of the Thirty-nine Articles, that the 
congregation of King's Chapel, then under Dr. Free- 
man's liberal leadership, came out openly for Uni- 
tarianism ; all of which may be found in Mr. George 
Willis Cooke's •' Unitarianism in America," and 
elsewhere. The other eccentrics described are Thomas 
Day (of " Sandford and Merton,") William Beckford, 
Landor, CVabb Robinson, Babbage. Douglas Jerrold, 
the poet Wither, James I., and Sir John Mande- 
viUe. Among the not too familiar good things in the 
book occurs a curious illustration of the ''scientific 
imagination." Babbage, the calculating machine, 
once capped the poet Rogers's story of having caught 
cold from mistaking a single-paned window for an 
open one, with the following : " When I go to the 
house of a friend in the country and unexpectedly 
remain for the night, having no nightcap, I should 
naturally catch cold. But by tying a bit of pack- 
thread tightly round my head I go to sleep imagining 
that I have a nightcap on ; consequently I catch no 
cold at all." Taken for no more than it professes 
to be, the book is a good one ; moreover, its chapters 
have already received the imprimatur of magazine

iana, this parasitic growth that flourishes on the great 
man's fame without lessening its vitality, Mrs. Edith 
NichoU Ellison has added " A Child's Recollections 
of Tennyson " ( Button) in a pretty illustrated book- 
let that can be easily read at a sitting. Mrs. Ellison 
is the daughter of Dean Bradley of Westminster. 
In her childhood the family used to spend a week 
or two twice a year in the Isle of Wight, two miles 
from the Tennysons ; and as the children of the two 
households were plapnates, her opportunities to see 
the poet were many. Her childhood impressions of 
him, as recalled after an interval of half a century, 
are eked out with recollections of some of his friends, 
and with other not always closely related matters. 
The writer says incidently of herself and playmates, 
" There were few of Tennyson's poems which we 
could not pour forth in moments of enthusiasm" — 
which would indicate that they were remarkable 
children. As a sample of the book's contents, let us 
close with the following an,ecdote, which is fravight 
with a deeper meaning. " One summer day he [the 
writer's father] arrived at his Freshwater home in 
high spirits, and almost immediately rushed oft' to 
see his poet friend. . . . My father smote him im- 
petuously on the shoulder, calling out, ' Hullo ! how 
are you?' The poet answered in a deep voice, and 
without even turning his head, ' Tired of life ! ' At 
this time, as it happened, Mr. Tennyson was particu- 
larly prosperous and fortunate in every way." 



IS^OTES. 



Charles Dickens's daughter, Mrs. Kate Perugini, has 
written a book about her father and his work. It is 
called " The Comedy of Charles Dickens." 

A new edition (the fourth) of Mr. C. T. Stockwell's 
" The Evolution of Immortality " is published by the 
James H. West Co. 

Emerson's essay on " Compensation," with an intro- 
duction by Mr. Lewis Nathaniel Chase, is a pleasing 
pamphlet publication of the Sewanee University Press. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish a new edition of 
Maine's " Ancient Law," brought into touch with recent 
political science by a special introduction and notes sup- 
plied by Sir Frederick Pollock. 

The Macmillan Co. publish an " Elementary Com- 
position," by Miss Dorothea F. Canfield and Professor 
George R. Carpenter ; also a text-book of " Exposition 
in Class-Room Practice," by Mr. Theodore C. Mitchell 
and Professor Carpenter. 



North's translation of a group of " Plutarch's Lives " 
(Coriolauus, Caisar, Brutus, and Antonius), edited by 
Mr. R. H. Carr, is a recent publication of Mr. Henry 
Frowde at the Oxford Clarendon Press. 

" Brooks's Readers," by Mr. Stratton D. Brooks, are 
a new series in eight numbers published by the Ameri- 
can Book Co. They are easily graded, attractively illus- 
trated, and altogether very acceptable in appearance. 

" The Young Folks' Cyclopaedia of Persons and 
Places," by Mr. John Denison Champlin, a work ap- 
proved by a quarter-century of childhood use, is issued 
in a revised edition (the fifth), by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. 

" Latinitas and Hellenismos," by Professor Charles 
Newton Smiley, is published by the University of Wis- 
consin, and is a study of the influence of the stoic theory 
of style as illustrated by the writings of a group of 
seven Latin authors. 

" Book by Book," by a group of English theologians 
headed by the Bishop of Worcester, is a recent publi- 
cation of the J. B. Lippincott Co. It is a series of 
popular studies upon the canonical books of the Bible, 
two volumes bound in one, covering respectively the 
Old and New Testaments. 

Thomas Nelson Page's first long story, " On New- 
found River," is being published by the Scribners in a 
new and enlarged edition. Mr. Page has rewritten and 
added much new material to the story, making it almost 
entirely new. Illustrations have also been provided for 
it by J. E. Jackson. 

A small treatise on " The Principles of English Verse," 
by Professor Charlton M.Lewis, comes to us frouiMessrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. It is in the main a plea for common 
sense as opposed to metaphysics in the treatment of the 
subject, and many a bewildered reader of larger works 
will be grateful for the breath of fresh air that comes 
to them from these pages. 

Four new volumes in the " Standard English Classics " 
of Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the following: Dickens's " A 
Tale of Two Cities," edited by Mr. James Weber Linn; 
Franklin's Autobiography, condensed by Mr. D. H. 
Montgomery, and mtroduced by Professor W. P. Trent ; 
Mrs. Gaskell's " Cranford," edited by Professor W. E. 
Simonds; and Arnold's "Sohrab and Rustum," with 
other poems, edited by Professors W. P. Trent and 
W. T. Brewster. 

Part II. of the " Elementary Chemistry, Progressive 
Lessons in Experiment and Theory," by Messrs. F. R. 
L. Wilson and G. W, Hedley, is piiblished by Mr. 
Henry Frowde. It is a handsome text-book of about 
four hundred pages From the same piiblisher we have 
a reprint of Mary Wollstonecraft's " Original Stories " 
(dated 1791), with Blake's illustrations and an intro- 
duction by Mr. E. V. Lucas. Mr. Frowde also sends 
VIS a new edition of Palgrave's " Treasury of Sacred 
Song," an always acceptable book 

The preoccupation of Dr. Paid Carus with Chinese 
subjects, to which many recent articles in "The Monist " 
and " The Open Court " bear witness, has just produced 
two little books of much interest. One is the " Yin Chih 
Wen," or " Tract of the Quiet Way," and the other is 
the " T'ai-Shang Kan-Ying P'ien," or " Treatise of the 
Exalted One on Response and Retribution." The trans- 
lations are by Mr. Teitaro Suzuki and Dr. Carus, and 
the books come from the Open Court Publishing Co. 
From the same source we hear " Amithaba, a Story of 
Buddliist Theology," an original work by Dr. Carus.

Interest in the Rubdiy^t of Omar Khayydm shows no 
signs of waning. Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. have in 
press for early publication an entirely new version, pre- 
pared by Mr. George Koe. The little book is to be issued 
in beautiful style,'uniform with Shirazi's "Life of Omar," 
published last Fall, and will be brought out simultane- 
ously in England and America. 

The " Pocket Edition " of Sir George Meredith's 
writings, published by the Messrs. Scribner, is now com- 
pleted by the appearance of eight new volumes, sis of 
which are novels, while one contains short stories, and 
one the poems. This neat edition of sLrteen volumes is 
very satisfactory for its purpose, and its appearance 
betokens a gratifying increase in the popularity of one 
of our greatest living writers. 

The Messrs. Crowell publish in their " Handy Vol- 
ume Classics " a volume entitled " Excursions," selected 
from Thoreau, with Emerson's biographical sketch; 
Thoreau's " The Maine Woods," edited by Mrs. Annie 
Russell Marble ; a volume of " Fireside Travels," by 
Lowell, with an introduction by Professor Trent; and 
Longfellow's " Tales of a Wayside Inn," with an in- 
troduction by Mr. Nathan HaskeU Dole. 

A second edition, entirely re-written, of Mr. William 
Warren Vernon's " Readings on the Inferno of Dante," 
based upon Benvenuto da Imola and other authorities, 
is published by Messrs. Methuen & Co. There is an 
introduction by Dr. Edward Moore, and the work occu- 
pies, as before, two dumpy volumes. The paper is 
thinner than in the previous edition, and the price some- 
what reduced. We need hardly add that this is one of 
the indispensable works for the student of the Italian 
poet. 

Following closely upon the aunoimcement of the Presi- 
dent's intended visit to the site of the Panama Canal 
comes the annoimcement of another new book on the 
subject. This one is from Messrs. Henry Holt and 
Company, and its title is " Panama and the Panama 
Canal." However, it is said to be unlike its prede- 
cessors, but is believed to be the first complete history 
of the four ceutiiries of canal agitation and attempts at 
creation available in any language. Dr. Willis Fletcher 
Johnson, the author, since de Lesseps's time has been a 
close student of and frequent writer on Isthmian Canal 
affairs. He has been on the spot with Secretary Taft, 
to whom by permission the book is dedicated. ■ 

A luxurious new edition of Benvenuto Cellini's Auto- 
biography will be issued shortly by Brentano's. An 
edition in handsome form has long been needed. This 
one has been planned to meet the requirements of both 
the student and the collector. The two volumes have 
been made at The Merrymount Press. The decorative 
title-page has been designed by Mr. Thomas Maitland 
Cleland, and the cover is adapted from a design by Mr. 
Laurence Housman. There are forty illustrations, 
reproductions in photogravure of Cellini's own sculptures 
and of portraits by Titian and others of personages 
mentioned in the Autobiography. The translation used 
is that produced by the late John Addington Symonds, 
the historian of the Italian Renaissance, who had an 
enthusiasm for autobiographies and made his version of 
Cellini's famous book a labor of love. SjTnonds's notes 
and his sketch of the author are included in this edition, 
for which a special introduction on Cellini as an artist 
and as a writer has also been prepared by Mr. Royal 
Cortissoz, the literary editor and art critic of the New 
York Tribime.

greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month, with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library 
index. Everything is arranged and classified, simply but exactly; 
whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ- 
ers or merely looking out for good things in general, the arrangement 
is equally convenient. C. It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine- 
land, — a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell; 
and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person.

BENVENUTO CELLINI 

Translated into English by John Addington Symonds, 
with an elaborate introduction by Hoyal Cortinsoz, 
A luxurious New Edition of Benvenuto Cellini's Auto- 
biography ; one of the most fascinating classics of Euro- 
pean Literature. This handsome edition has been 
planned to meet requirements of both the Student and 
the Collector. 

" A book which the great Goethe thought 
worthy of translating into German with 
the pen of Faust and WUhelm Meister. 
A book which Auguste Comte placed upon 
his very limited list for the perusal of re- 
formed humanity is one with which we 
have the right to be occupied, not once or 
twice, but over and over again. It can 
not lose its freshness. AlVhat attracted 
the encyclopaedic names of men so differ- 
ent as Comte and Goethe to its pages 
still remains there. The adventures of 
this potent human actuality will bear 
comparison with those of Gil Bias, or 
the Comte of Monte Cristo, or Quentin 
Durward, or Les Trois Mousquetairs. for 
their variety and their pungent interest."

THE PURCHASE OF FLORIDA: Its His- 
tory and Diplomacy. By Hubert Brcce Fuix£r, 
A.M.. LL.M. With maps, 8vo, cloth, $2.50 net (postage 19ct«.). 
While the subject of this book forms, properly, only a "chapter" 
in the history of American diplomacy, its importance can hardly 
be overestimated. It is most intimately related to the politics of 
the period, the Florida negotiations directly 



1776=1819 



affecting the presidential aspirations of sev- 
eral of the men concerned, and is intensely 
interesting. Jackson's high-handed course in 
Florida during the Seminole War and the clever diplomacy of 
Quincy Adams, which resulted in the final cession, are described 
in a pleasing and readable manner." It shows Uncle Sam," says 
a review. " in t he light of the school-yard tyrant taking away the 
nice red apple of Spain, the littlest and feeblest boy in the class. 
And it finds the brightest scholar making specious justification

THE HAYES-TILDEN DISPUTED 

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1876. 

By Paci Lbxand Haworth, Lecturei- in History, Columbia 
Unii-ersity. 12mo, buckram, $1.50 net (postage, 12 cts.). 
Thirty years ago this fall, a little more than eleven years after 
the close of the war for the L'nion. the United States was racked 
by a dispute over the election of a president which was so in- 
tensely bitter and passionate on both sides 



1865=1876 



that the country was brought perilously near 
the verge of another civil conflict. Of this 
dispute, its origin, the claims of either party, 
the facts so far as they clearly can be ascertained, its ending, of 
the means by which the ending was accomplished, and of the 
general consequences. Mr. Haworth has prepared a compact 
story. His treatment of the subject and the conclusions he reaches 
are marked by a quality not too common among historians — : 

strong, common sense. 

Any one of the above, or all three combined, will form a most 
valuable addition to any collection of books on political sub- 
ject*. And even-for cursory reading, they are full of spirited 
narration, useful instruction, and accurate information.

1906] THE DIAL, 259 

How many authors in a century receive, on their 
first appearance, such notices as the following, with 
most of the leading papers yet to be heard from? 

The Nation :— AMERICAN 

" We do not recommend it to impatient readers. To all others, we recommend it with something more nearly 
approaching enthusiasm than is usually expected of the jaded novel-reader of tradition. . . . Seriously, we take 
this to be a novel of imcommon quality. . . . We hardly know how to suggest the mellowness of this story, and 
therein lies its charm. In detail it is often brilliant, sometimes exuberant — a work of true humor." 

New York Times Review: — 

" No work of fiction at once so broadly human, so variously delightful ... so richly and distinctly a liter- 
ary transcript of significant things in a real life, has appeared in a long time. Even ' The Divine Fire ' of Miss 
May Sinclair, the book of recent years which comes nearest to the mark, must yield place to this. . . . Rich in 
felicitous wordings of things everybody ought to see and does not or would like to say and cannot ... a book 
worth reading and re-reading and keeping in your house." 

Spectator :— ENGLISH 

" A remarkable novel, a fine novel, by whatever standards we judge it. We have never for a moment a doubt 
about the reality. Every character, down to the humblest, has the stamp of a genuine humanity. Mr. DeMorgau 
shows that it is possible to be shrewd without cynicism, and humorous without buffoonery. No book has appeared 
for long in which lovers of the classic tradition in English fiction are likely to find such genei-ous entertainment." 
Speaker : — 

" A human document, and impresses one as a close study from life itself. The humour is too drj- to have 
been invented, the satire too delicate. And the sadness of the book, too, is the sadness of life, the tragedy that 
arises from mistake. . . . Deserves to stand high above the average output of fiction."

A 



YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE. 



The annual reviews of the chief Continental 
literatures, which have long constituted one of 
the most valuable services of the London "Ath- 
enaeum,"' are no longer regidarlv presented in a 
single group of articles, but are scattered through 
the year as occasion seems to warrant. Two 
recent numbers of our English contemporary 
have contained reports from Germany, Italy, 
Spain, and Kussia, which we here attempt to 
summarize. 

The German report, by Dr. Ernst Heilbom, 
instead of essaying the customary survey of the 
whole field of literary production, is this year 
confined to a discussion of t%vo books. Pastor 
Frenssen's novel " Hilligenlei " and Herr 
Schnitzler's comedy "• Zwischenspiel." The for- 
mer work, which we review elsewhere in its En- 
glish translation, need not for that reason long 
detain us. We quote only a single suggestive 
sentence from Dr. Heilbom : 

" In the episodes in which Herr Frenssen gives poet- 
ical and popular expression to those dim fancies and 
presentiments of struggling, self-willed souls that are 
so characteristic of his Holstein people, his style resem- 
bles that of the ballad- writers ; we get the impression 
that a master of the short ballad — he has never pub- 
lished anything in that form — is trying his hand, and 
not altogether to his advantage, at a long prose nar- 
rative." 

Turning to Herr Schnitzler's play, we read of 
the author that " he is a sceptic, and puts no 
faith in sensual impulses." The situation in 
" Zwischenspiel " is thus introduced : 

" A man and a woman, both of whom are free from 
prejudices of any kind, have married. He is a musical 
director, and she a singer, and the unconventional views 
held in the artistic circles they frequent have influenced 
them deeply. Even from the beginning they felt that 
their union would have to come to an end as soon as 
their love for each other should be dead. Their part- 
nership, however, was, as they imagined, based upon one 
solid foundation — that of sincerity. They have prom- 
ised — and hitherto have kept the promise — that they 
will speak the truth to each other unreservedly, even if 
the day should come when one or the other falls in love 
with someone else." 

But temptation comes to both, and "the very 
sincerity on which they had relied proves their 
ruin." The working out of the play offers a 



270 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



tangle of infidelity, suspicion, attempted recon- 
ciliation, and final separation. The play proves, 
we are told, " that the institution of marriage is 
justified in its own nature, and those who con- 
sider themselves superior to all the traditional 
conceptions of morality are themselves made to 
furnish the proof," which is a most excellent 
moral. The critic makes a comparison between 
the two significant writers of whom he has been 
discoursing. The novelist, he says, 
" Has the health and sturdy independence of one who 
lives a country life, looks his fellows straight in the face, 
and turns his clear gaze up to the stars in visionary 
thought. . . [The dramatist] is the neurotic, moody, sen- 
sitive child of the metropolis, who makes it his task to 
arrest and hold fast the fleeting impulses of the spirit, 
and to whom reality appears illusion, and illusion real- 
ity. We may feel ourselves drawn to the one or the 
other according to our temperament, but neither can be 
ignored." 

Dr. Guido Biagi's notes on Italian literature 
give the first place to Senator Fogazzaro's " II 
Santo," of which also we review the translation 
upon another page of this issue. This book, the 
writer remarks, " produces the effect of those 
ultra-modern religious pictures in which Christ 
is seen appearing at a supper of persons clad in 
evening dress. The violent contrast between 
the theme and the modern and mundane atmo- 
sphere destroys all verisimilitude." We have 
already said something like this about " Hill- 
igenlei," and the observation applies to " II 
Santo " with perhaps gi'eater truth. Other 
Italian fiction of the year includes Signora 
Serao's " Dopo il Perdono " and Signer Diego 
Angeli's " L'Orda d'Oro, ' which is a story of 
" that cosmopolitan society which flocks to 
Rome in search of the distractions offered by 
the only capital in existence that can boast of 
two Courts and two diplomatic worlds, where 
carnival and dance can be had in double doses." 
A highly important work in the dramatic field 
is Prof essor Luigi Rosi's " Italian Comedians," 
being two richly illustrated volumes upon the 
history of the Italian stage. A. few other works 
are " La Poesia Popolare Italiana," by Sig. A. 
d'Ancona; "Nuovi Studi Danteschi," by Sen- 
ator F. d'Ovidio ; " La Donna Fiorentina del 
Buon Tempo Antico," by Professor I. del 
Lungo ; and a " Manuale Comparative di Let- 
terature Stranieri," by Professors G. Mazzoni 
and P. E. Pavolini. 

Don Rafael Altamira says that " the balance 
of the last twelve months has been rather against 
Spanish literature." The death of Valera a year 
ago has been followed by that of Pereda, the 
novelist of Santander, and by that of the poet 



Manuel Palacio. Although all three lived to 
an advanced age, and had probably given their 
best to the world, " they seem to cast a sort of 
tutelary shade within which are developed the 
authors who are destined to replace them." 
The important enterprise of the resuscitated 
" Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles " is discussed 
at considerable length, and special comment is 
made upon the four volumes of the new series 
already published. It seems that works in 
Catalan and in Latin are also to be included 
in this library. In fiction, Senor Galdos has 
published a new " Episodio Nacional " entitled 
" La Vuelta al Mundo en la Numancia," de- 
scribed as " the most perfect and eloquent, as 
well as the most effective, of his symbolical 
works. ' Other novels are " Tristan o el Pesi- 
mismo," by Senor Valdes, and " La Maja 
Desnudo," by Senor Ibanez. Three novelists 
of the younger school are Senor Ciges Aparicio, 
author of " Del Hospital"; Senor Sanchez Diaz,, 
author of "Juan Corazon"; and Senor Miro, 
author of " Del Vivir." All tlu-ee are " remark- 
able for energy of thought and expression, for 
the realistic sincerity of their transcriptions,, 
and for an engaging audacity of view." 

Russian literature, of which Mr. Valerii 
Briusov is the chronicler, has been much affected 
by the revolutionary movement and the com- 
parative freedom that the press has enjoyed 
during the past year or more. Under these- 
changed conditions, we are told, 

" Numerous new periodicals appeared in Russia, withi 
very varied objects, and extending to social democratic 
aud revolutionary programmes. Many of these were- 
suppressed after the first numbers or after an existence 
of some weeks, but they were soon reissued under an- 
other name, and readers recognized this change of masks. 
Satirical magazines appeared in numbers, ridiculing the 
higher ranks of the Government and their activities;; 
and in this way in Russia, after a long interval, political 
and social satire arose. Pamphlets on political subjects 
had a great circulation (for the most part translations 
of chapters of books by Marx, Kautski, Labriola, Van- 
dervelde, and Kropotkin), sometimes running to hun- 
dreds of thousands of copies. At first pamphlets of a 
social-democratic tendency had the greatest success;: 
in the later period those dealing with the advocacy of 
anarchist theories were in the greatest demand." 

Many books of a kind heretofore impossible in 
Russia also found publication — books about 
the Decembrists and studies in constitutional 
law. Even such a work as Radistchev's " Jour- 
ney from St. Petersburg to Moscow," which 
caused the writer to be severely punished in 
.1790, has at last been permitted to see the 
light. Mr. Andreev's " To the Stars " is the 
most noteworthy dramatic publication of the 



1906.]

year. Although the censorship keeps it from 
the stage, it has been widely read and discussed. 
" In this play a savant is represented who is 
entirely devoted to astronomical questions, and 
there is a circle of revolutionaires occupied en- 
tirely with contemporary matters, the burning 
questions of the day." Mr. Andreev has also 
collected his best " Tales " into a volume. " The 
Red Sword " is a collection of stories by Mrs. Z. 
Gippius, " written in an elaborate and original 
style." Professor Merezhkovski has been the 
most conspicuous literary figure of the year, 
having published three books which are thus 
described : 

" ' The Coming Vulgarian ' characterizes A. Chekhov 
and Gorki as writers without religious feeling: in their 
success, especially that of the latter, the author sees a 
symptom of the coming triumph of the \Tilgar fellow, 
everything that is grovelling in man. In ' The Prophet 
of the Russian Revolution,' he gives a totally new point 
of view of Dostoievski. The author shows that there 
is a profoimd disagreement between Dostoievski's offi- 
cial Slavophile views, justifjnng Russian autocracy, and 
the spirit of revolt which lies hid in his work. The 
terrible force of revolution is more dangerous to society 
than all the attempts of the throwers of bombs. His 
third work, ' Gogol and the Devil,' gives an original 
interpretation of the person and fate of Gogol." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The mechanicai, spirit of the age, so far at least 
as it shows itself in the production of meclianical music, 
is deplored by Mr. Sousa in a recent magazine article. 
The protest comes none too soon. For a number of 
years now it has been possible to soothe the savage 
breast by dropping a coin into a penny-in-the-slot 
machine, to soften rocks by gramophone, and to bend a 
knotted oak with the pianola. The camera and process- 
printing devices combine to give us cheap machine-made 
art; type-setting machines and steam presses facilitate 
the wholesale manufacture of make-believe literature 
for the market-place; type-writers, phonographs, and 
stenographers do their united utmost to verify Cowper's 
familiar line and make poetry itself a mere mechanic art. 

" On Behaviour at Meals," a quaint and curious 
essay written by Erasmiis five centuries ago, lays down 
some rules that are almost too homely for quotation, 
but that help the modern reader to believe the world is 
really impro\-ing, if not in its major morals, at least in 
its minor. This is comforting, unless one happens to be 
disquieted by a lurking suspicion that refinement of 
manners may be attended by a corresponding refine- 
ment of wickedness. However that may be, the essay- 
ist gravely admonishes his readers that it is " very rude 
to blow your nose on the table-cloth," or " to wipe your 
fingers on your neighbor's coat." " Never praise the 
results of your cook's labours or press your guests to eat, 
whether they like or not. Never criticise your host's 
dinner imfavourably even if it be badly cooked. Pass 



over all these things in silence. Do not give dogs your 
bones to crack under the table, or feed the cat, or en- 
courage animals to jump on the table." Above all, " do 
not lick your plate; it is an act that ill-becomes a cat, 
let alone a gentleman." To descend some rounds on the 
literary ladder, possibly a novel-i-eader here and there 
may recall that TroUope makes Conway Dalrymple, in 
" The Last Chronicle of Barsetshire," refuse on prin- 
ciple Mr. Dobbs Broughton's '47 claret when that gen- 
tleman had himself praised the wine and told its price. 
But it is doubtfid whether Dalrymple, or even Trollope, 
knew that he was here frowning on the violation of one 
of Erasmus's rules. This brief reference to the learned 
Dutch scholar and one of his minOr works is prompted 
by a peep into Mr. Richard Davey's recent interesting 
volumes on " The Pageant of London." 

The art of solitude, if the expression is allowable, 
appears to be in some danger of becoming a lost art in 
these crowded hours of glorious life. The means of 
intercommunication are superabundant, and we nm the 
risk of forgetting Sir Thomas Browne's wholesome ad- 
vice. " Be able to be alone," he counsels the reader, in 
his " Christian Morals." " Lose not the advantage of 
solitude, and the society of thyself; nor be only content, 
but delight to be alone and single with Omnipresency. 
He who is thus prepared, the day is not uneasy, nor the 
night black unto him. Darkness may bound his eyes, 
not his imag^ination." As if with these last words of 
Browne's in his mind, Lowell says in his essay on 
Dryden: " Solitude is as needful to the imagination as- 
society is wholesome for the character." Gibbon in 
his memoirs has left this stately note of a yearly custom 
of his : " On the approach of spring I withdraw without 
reluctance from the noisy and extensive scene of crowds 
without company, and dissipation without pleasure " 
The golden mean is of course the thing to aim at. 
"Here again, as so often," writes Emerson, "Nature 
delights to put us between extreme antagonisms, and 
our safety is in the skill with which we keep the diag- 
onal line. Solitude is impracticable, and society fatal. 
We must keep our head in the one, and our hands in the 
other. The conditions are met if we keep our independ- 
ence, yet do not lose our sjTnpathy. These wonderful 
horses need to be driven by fine hands." 

The Greek vase, so effectively used by Keats in 
his finest ode, has again been admirably employed as an 
illustration, or symbol, by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, 
in a recent public address. The " Attic shape " served 
the speaker to typify the contrast between American 
civilization and that of Continental Europe. A pyramid 
is the form taken by European society, — broad at the 
base and tapering upward to the point for whose sup- 
port all the substructure has its being; and, it might be 
added, the base of the pyramid is little less likely to 
rise than is the peasant of Europe. American society, 
on the other hand, is viewed by Dr. Hale in his indom- 
itable optimism as having the gracefid and flowing out- 
lines of a Greek vase, — contracted at the base, swelling 
to ample proportions in the middle, and narrowing only 
a little as it nears the top. In other words, the mud- 
sill of our social structure presents itself to the speak- 
er's eye as no more conspicuous than such a fimdament 
ought to be in a well-designed piece of architecture.

The newspaper habit is deservedly stigmatized in 
a timely little volmne of essays on bookish themes by 
one who, as librarian, and in other capacities, has rend- 
ered honorable service to the cause of culture. Without 
searching his pages for arguments and proofs, anyone 
might with little difficulty show that an indiscriminate 
newspaper diet cannot but produce flippancy, superfi- 
ciality, aimlessuess, vulgar curiosity, commonplaceness, 
laziness, mental flabbiness, disregard for truth, a grow- 
ing thirst for sensation, and many other undesirable 
qualities. In these days when the chief purveyor, in 
this country, of this variety of literature, and that too 
in its most objectionable form, is manifesting ambitions 
of a kind that, unless checked, might bring him in the 
end to sit in very high places, no condemnation of this 
demoralizing species of reading-matter can be made too 
emphatic or repeated too often. It is true that the 
rising tide of newspapers is not to be swept back with 
the broom of literary censure ; yet as honest Sancho has 
assured us that " there is a remedy for all things but 
death," even the literary critic may take heart. At the 
very worst, the disease will probably, in the fulness of 
time, work its own cure. When the reading public has 
had its nausea raised to the right pitch, the stomach will 
refuse to receive any longer its unsavory food.

Life's little ironies give a never-failing piquancy 
and charm to the daily round of otherwise humdrum 
duties and vapid pleasures, even as destiny's grim mock- 
eries impart a tragic meaning, awfid in its fascination, 
to the larger concerns of life. Thomas Wotton, the 
father of Sir Henry, was wont to declare again and 
again, " That if ever he did pxit on a resolution to 
marry, he was seriously resolved to avoid three sorts of 
persons: namely. Those that had children; Those that 
had Law-suits; And those that were of his kindred." 
Nevertheless he wedded as his second wife a woman in 
whom was found " a concurrence of all those accidents 
against which he had so seriously resolved," and who, 
be it added, became the mother of Sir Henry. "When 
me they fly, I am the wings," is fate's mocking com- 
ment on those that think to escape their destiny. 
Rings thrown into the sea in the morning are served 
up in the fish course at dumer. Cinderella, banished 
to the kitchen hearth, weds the handsome prince. 
Cyrus, delivered to Harpagus to be killed, lives to de- 
throne his hard-hearted grandfather Astyages. (Edipus, 
maimed and exposed on Mt. Cithseron by his father 
Laius, survives to perpetrate, unwittingly, the most 
terrible crimes. And so on, in an imending variety of 
fable and legend illustrating the same familiar theme. 
These reflections, the triteness of which is not denied, 
are the fruit of a pleasant hour with Walton's " Lives." 
From the trivialities of modern members one turns with 
relief to the old masterpieces of biography, simple and 
stately, presenting the larger outlines of character and 
conduct.

A Bizarre Book on Dickens.* 



Chestertonese, like Johnsonese, has so marked 
and invariable a character that it is easy to rec- 
ognize and not difficidt to imitate, however hard 
it may be to equal. One might discourse for 
hours in the Chestertonic manner, beginning 
somewhat as follows : There is a very common 
saying that virtue is its own reward ; but noth- 
ing could be further from the truth : virtue is 
its own penalty. And then, by placing oneself 
on one's head and viewing all things inverted, 
one could easily demonstrate the collective wis- 
dom of the sages to be foolishness, tear to tat- 
ters the maxims of world-old experience, and 
leave the generally accepted conventions not a 
leg to stand on. To a fluent writer with a well- 
developed bump of destructiveness, this is as 
exhilarating as smashing window-panes is to the 
small boy with a pocketful of pebbles. But to 
maintain the sensation in its first riotous inten- 
sity, the window-panes must increase in size, the 
paradoxes must grow ever more paradoxical. 

That Mr. Chesterton indidges in his wonted 
orgy of paradox in his already famous book on 
Dickens, is only saying that he is still the Mr. 
Chesterton of " Varied Types " and " Heretics." 
Some one has spoken, perhaps a little unkindly, 
of his " tremendous, breathless, bank-holiday vol- 
ubility of expression." This rushing overflow of 
superabundant health and high spirits is not in 
itself a thing to be condenmed so much as won- 
dered at and enjoyed. Taking jDassage in one 
of his breezy volumes, we straightway find our- 
selves (to adopt a current favorite metaphor and 
nomenclature) automobiling — we are tempted to 
say " automobubbling " — over the literary high- 
way in a quite breathless and pulse-quickening 
fashion. To be sure, the machine has some little 
tricks of its own, — a way of jerking the pas- 
senger's breath out of his body and shaking him 
up now and then, that is rather disconcerting at 
first, but at last becomes merely monotonous and 
tiresome. For example — and the figure must 
now be dropped — three times at least in the 
book under review democracy is characterized 
as undemocratic. " The democracy," declares 
Mr. Chesterton, "has a hundred exuberant good 
qualities ; the democracy has only one outstand- 
ing sin — it is not democratic." And again, speak- 
ing for Dickens, and as if expressly commissioned

by him : " He realized that representative gov- 
ernment has many minor disadvantages, one of 
them being that it is never representative." The 
initial major defect has here become a minor. 
Still again, in the same strain : "' Carlyle fan- 
cied that our modern English government was 
wordy and long-winded because it was demo- 
cratic government. Dickens saw, what is cer- 
tainly the fact, that it is wordy and long-winded 
because it is aristocratic government." 

Before dropping the subject of mannerisms 
and taking up the consideration of Mr. Ches- 
terton's book as a whole, a few more instances 
may be cited. A sti-aining for startling effects 
and for epigrammatic smartness is, of course, 
all too apparent, though it would probably be 
nearer the truth to call this not a straining, but 
an over-indulged natural inclination. He wTites : 
" The common mind means the mind of all the 
artists and heroes ; or else it would not be com- 
mon. Plato had the common mind : Dant« had 
the common mind ; or that mind was not com- 
mon." And on an earlier page : " Carlyle 
killed the heroes ; there have been none since 
his time. He killed the heroic (which he dearly 
loved ) by forcing upon each man this question : 
' Am I strong or weak ? ' " Another instance : 
" And while they might easily get more satis- 
faction out of a screaming article in The War 
Cry than out of a page of Emerson about the 
Over-soul, this would not be because the page 
of Emerson is another and superior kind of lit- 
erature. It would be because the page of Em- 
erson is another (and inferior) kind of religion." 
And finally : " There is no idea more vulgar or 
more ignorant than the notion that a gentleman 
is generally what is called refined." The au- 
thor's favorite mode of emphasizing a writer's 
excellences is illustrate<l by the folloAving char- 
acterizations of Dickens's art. " We may," he 
writes, " almost say this : that he coidd only make 
his characters probable if he was allowed to 
make them impossible." " Dickens's art is like 
life because, like life, it is irresponsible, because, 
like life, it is incredible." Is not this the very 
false gallop of consecutive reasoning ? It is a 
perpetual game of bluff ; the reader has no 
sooner recovered breath after one startling asser- 
tion than he is again struck speechless with 
another. Credo quia impotusibile, is all he can 
gasj) imder this bombardment of paradox. One 
outrageously Chestertonian phrase, " a raving 
windmill of pessimism," seems made expressly 
to fit Shakespeare's designation of " Avild and 
whirling words." 

But enough of the author's well-known idio- 



syncrasies. As to the substance of his book, he 
is successfvd in showing the reasons of Dickens's 
popidaritj', in tracing the development of Dick- 
ens the writer from the early "• Sketches by Boz " 
through the transitional " David Copperfield " 
to the final and unfinished " Edwin Drood." 
" Pickwick " he considers the flower of Dick- 
ens's genius, although it is not a novel ; for, 
excepting " The Tale of Two Cities," Dickens 
wrote no novels. He was the showman of cer- 
tain immortal and familiar types. Like the 
folk-lore legends handed down from age to age, 
Dickens's stories have no rounded completeness, 
with definite beginning and end. They are 
myths, capable of indefinite expansion. As Mr. 
Chesterton expresses it, — 

" Dickens was a mythologist rather than a novelist ; 
he was the last of the mythologists, and perhaps the 
greatest. He did not always manage to make his char- 
acters men, but he always managed, at the least, to 
make them gods. They are creatures like Punch or 
Father Christmas. They live statically, in a perpetual 
summer of being themselves. It was not the aim of 
Dickens to show the effect of time and circumstance upon 
character; it was not even his arm to show the effect of a 
character on time and circumstance. It is worth remark, 
in passing, that whenever he tried to describe change in a 
character, he made a mess of it, as in the repentance of 
Dombey or the apparent deterioration of Boffin." 

Considerable space is given to the American 
experiences and impressions of Dickens, and 
the writer is friendly to us in his treatment of 
the subject. He sympathizes with the Amer- 
ican resentment of Dickens's eager advocacy of 
international copyright. " A beautifid young 
dreamer," we read, "ought qpt to be even 
conscious of copyrights. For it is quite unjust 
to say that the Americans worship the dollar. 
They really do worship intellect — another of 
the passing superstitions of our time." The 
following comment on " Martin Chuzzlewit " 
contains more than a grain of truth. 

" Martin Chuzzlewit's America is a mad-house : but 
it is a mad-house we are all on the road to. For com- 
pleteness and even comfort are almost the definitions of 
insanity. The lunatic is the man who lives in a small 
worid but thinks it a large one : he is the man who lives 
in a tenth of the truth, and thinks it is the whole. . . . 
Hence the more cleariy we see the world divided into 
Saxons and non-Saxons, into our splendid selves and 
the rest, the more certain we may be that we are slowly 
and quietly going mad. The more plain and satisfying 
our state appears, the more we may know that we are 
living in an unreal world. For the real world is not 
satisfying. . . . The real world is full of bracing be- 
wilderments and brutal surprises." 

Who of us, with even the dimmest remem- 
brance of his youth, can read without a respon- 
sive twinge what Mr. Chesterton says about 
some of boyhood's agonies ?

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



" The bitterness of boyish distresses does not lie in 
the fact that they are large ; it lies in the fact that they 
are small. About any early disaster there is a dreadful 
finality; a lost child can suffer like a lost soul. It is 
currently said that hope goes with youth, and lends to 
youth its wings of a butterfly; but I fancy that hope is 
the last gift given to man, and the only gift not given 
to youth. Youth is preeminently the period in which 
a man can be lyric, fanatical, poetic; but youth is the 
period in which a man can be hopeless. The end of 
every episode is the end of the world. But the power 
of hoping through everything, the knowledge that the 
soul survives its adventures, that great inspiration 
comes to the middle-aged; God has kept that good wine 
imtil now. It is from the backs of the elderly gentle- 
men that the wings of the butterfly should burst. There 
is nothing that so much mystifies the young as the con- 
sistent frivolity of the old. They have discovered their 
indestructibility. They are in their second and clearer 
childhood, and there is a meaning in the merriment of 
their eyes. They have seen the end of the End of the 
World." 

It is in passages like this that the writer speaks 
with a happy insight and a telling force of ex- 
pression that make one almost forgive him his 
irritating perversities and eccentricities. Espe- 
cially good also is what he has to say about 
Dickens's faulty management of his characters, 
although the good things are, as usual, clothed 
in paradox. A chapter on the great characters 
of Dickens is followed by one on his optimism, 
and this by a final brief chapter on his probable 
future. The author ventures to suggest that 
Dickens's " place in nineteenth century England 
will not only be high, but altogether the high- 
est '*; and further, with the current wrong use 
of a much over- worked word, " I venture to offer 
the proposition that when more years have 
passed and more weeding has been effected, 
Dickens will dominate the whole England of the 
nineteenth century ; he will be left on that plat- 
form alone." This and other judgments in the 
book display such a lack of judicious deliberation 
and seemly moderation as to injure the work as 
a piece of criticism. As a life of Dickens it 
does not profess to have value. At the same 
time, it is entertaining, suggestive, brilliant in 
spots, the very last book one would go to sleep 
over. As a self-portrayal of Mr. Chesterton, 
rather than a picture of his greater f eUow-coun- 
tryman, it has decided merits. The eye sees 
only what it brings with it. Again and again 
Mr. Chesterton hits off his own characteristics 
in seeking to detect those of his hero. " Up- 
roariously readable " he calls Dickens ; and up- 
roariously readable one is at times inclmed to 
call Mr. Chesterton. Dickens's delight in " great 
draughts of words" is surely equalled by his 
latest critic's. If Dickens possessed " hilarious 
self -consciousness," his eulogist is not lacking 



therein ; and if the elder writer was always 
striving for " the pungent perfection of epithet," 
the younger is not less eager in the quest. Those 
who like literary fireworks wiU thoroughly enjoy 
the book. The more sober-minded will deplore 
the fatal facility of this vigorous and original 
thinker, a facility that has drawn him into pro- 
lific authorship before his mind has been sea- 
soned with long years of study and observation 
and silent thought. He has made haste to set 
every stitch of canvas before a favoring breeze, 
without adequate ballast in his hold. He has 
achieved his reputation at an age when many a 
scholar is, with much self-questioning and many 
doubts, first venturing to contribute of his accu- 
mulated treasure toward the enriclunent of the 
world's thought. Never can the bizarre, as such, 
be of enduring worth. Pj,rcy F. Bicknell. 



After the War in Dixie.* 



During the past few years there have appeared 
a number of interesting books of war reminis- 
cences by Southern women. Two of the best 
of these, " A Virginia Girl in the Civil War " 
and " A Diary from Dixie," were edited by 
Mrs. Myrta Lockett Avary, a native Virginian, 
who now appears again in print with a volume 
of her own on " Dixie after the War," the first 
book written by a woman dealing with that 
stormy period and the smouldering fires of con- 
troversy which it enkindled. Owing to the 
exceeding interest of the subject, it is probable 
that this volume wiU be followed by others of 
a similar natiu-e. Such books are valuable, but 
they can hardly compare in popular interest 
with those dealing with the more heroic phases 
of actual war. The mere mention of Recon- 
struction causes an unpleasant feeling ; people 
on both sides of the line are still irritated about 
it ; they are not agreed, and it will be long be- 
fore they are. Consequently no book that 
touches its vital problems will be accepted with- 
out controversy. No one, unless it be some 
scientific historian, now believes that an unbi- 
assed account of the happenings of those times 
could be written ; no one with human feelings. 
Northerner or Southerner, can read or write of 
many of the happenings of that time without 
exasperation. 

Probably about all we can reasonably expect 
in the way of fairness and soberness, in dealing

with the Reconstruction period, has been done 
in the vohime under review. Its thirty-three 
chapters treat, from the Southern woman's 
point of Aaew, practically all that was of interest, 
as shown by such variety and range of topics as 
these : The last campaigns of the war in the 
heart of the Confederacy ; the dissolution of the 
Confederate government; Lincoln in Richmond; 
the military occupation, military government, 
and relations between the soldiers and the South- 
ern whites and blacks ; the home-coming of the 
Confederates ; the imprisonment of Southern 
leaders : the negroes and freedom ; the aftermath 
of war — want and suffering among whites and 
blacks : religious affairs, amusements, fashions ; 
the initiation and continuance of negro govern- 
ment : illegal secret societies ; relations between 
the races during the Reconstruction period ; the 
carpet-bagger's crooked political methods, and 
the overthrow of Reconstruction ; race preju- 
dice and " crimes against women "; and, filially, 
iJie meaning of Memorial and Confederate pa- 
triotic societies. The author does not pretend 
to deal ^\^th the purely political problems, but 
aims rather to show what the Southern people 
of both colors were doing and thinking and say- 
ing after the war. Her sources of information 
are her o^^^l experiences, journals and letters of 
friends, contemporary newspapers and public 
documents. A wide acquaintance with the lit- 
erature of the period is shown, and there are 
few slips as to facts, names, and dates. The 
book is written in a lively anecdotal style ; the 
author has a keen sense of humor and a pro- 
found concejjtion of the value of a good story. 
She has the right knack of selecting the most 
striking facts, and presenting them at the proper 
time and place in her narrative. Her work will 
throw many side-lights on the dreary political 
history of the times. While the book is written 
from the Southern woman's point of view (and 
she says that Southern women have foimd it 
diffieidt to get over war and Reconstruction), it 
is generous and fair. In describing the military 
<xjcupation, she says : " I hate to say hard things 
of men in blue, and I must say all the good 
things I can. Because many were unworthy to 
wear the blue, many who were worthy have 
carried reproach." The imdisciplined black 
troops were guiltj" of horrible outrages ; but for 
the white troops she has little but praise. The 
most irritating parts of the military regime^ — 
the frequent compidsory oath-takings, the flag 
persecutions, the " button " order, the regulation 
of church services and marriages, — are de- 
scribed in a series of anecdotes, of which the 



following is a good example. It is taken from 
a diary of the time. 

" At church I saw officers wearing side arms. They 
come regularly to watch if we pray for the President 
of the United States. I hope they were edified. A 
number stood up during that prayer. Among the most 
erect were the M — girls, who have very retrousse noses. 
The Yankees reported: 'Not only do they stand up 
when the President is prayed for, but they turn up their 
noses.' They sent word back: ' A mightier power than 
the Yankee Army turned up our noses " ' ! 

The military conunanders were gentlemen, 
and shielded the people in many ways, often 
making themselves offensive to radical politi- 
cians. The enlisted men were prompt to aid 
the helpless and relieve sviffering. One would 
give his rations to the himgry ; another would 
guard the homes of unprotected women. The 
following story, told of an Atlanta lady now 
living, then a young wife whose husband had 
not yet returned after the surrender, is one of 
the best in the book : 

" A big-hearted Irishman caught the little lady strug- 
gling over soap-suds. It looked as if she would never 
get those clothes clean. For one thing, when she tried 
to wring them, they were streaked with blood from her 
arms and hands. . . . ' Faith an' bejabbers,' said Pat, 
' an' what is it that you 're thryin' to do ? ' ' Go away, 
and let me alone ! ' ' Faith, an' if you don't lave off 
clanin' thim garmints, they '11 be that doirty — .' ' Go 
'way ! ' ' Sure, me choild, an' if ye'll jis' step to the 
other soide if the tub without puttin' me to the in- 
con vaniauce — .' He was about to pick her up in his 
mighty hands. She moved. ... * Sure, an' it's as good 
a washerwoman as iwer wore breeches I am,' said Pat. 
... In short order he had all the clothes hanging snow 
white on the line; before he left, he cut enough wood 
for her ironing. ' I 'm your Bridget ivery washday that 
comes 'roun,' he said. . . . This brother-man did her 
wash every week." 

Naturally there was little social mingling of 
Northern people and Southerners ; the women 
especially kept at home, with windows closed, 
but we have the author's word for it that the 
young ones often peeped through the blinds to 
see what the Northern visiting ladies wore. 

" I will never forget how queer we thought the dress 
of the Northern ladies. . . . Their gowns were short 
walking length, and their feet could be seen quite 
plainly. That style would be becoming to us, we said 
to ourselves. ... I got one as soon as I could. . . . 
We thought [their hats] the most absurd and trifling 
things. But we made haste to get some." 

A Southern girl who accepted the attentions 
of a " Yankee beau " was frowned upon. It 
was considered imfair to the dilapidated Con- 
federate swains now returning from the war. 
But some amusiog things happenetl through this 
exclusiveness. For example : 

" Our ladies went veiled on the street. . . . There 
was not much opportunity for young blue-coats to so

much as behold our pretty girls, much less make eyes 
at them. . . . Mary Triplett, our famous blonde beauty, 
was walking along, when the wind took off her veil and 
carried it to the feet of a young Federal officer. He 
bent, uplifted the vagrant mask, and with his cap held 
before his eyes restored it." 

Some of the most instructive chapters in the 
book are devoted to the conduct of the neg^'oes 
after the war. In spite of all demoralization, 
it is clear that they took their freedom well. 
For their ill behavior, others than themselves 
were mainly to blame. Of Lincoln's first and 
only speech to the Southern blacks, Mrs. Avary 
says : 

" Mercurial blacks collected about Mr. Lincoln, im- 
peding his progress, kneeling to him, hailing him as 
' Saviour,' and 'My Jesus! ' They sang, shouted, danced. 
One woman jumped up and down, shrieking, ' I 'm free! 
I 'm free ! ' Some went into the regidar Voodoo ecstasy, 
leaping, whirling, stamping, until their clothes were half 
torn off. Mr. Lincoln made a speech in which he said: 
' My poor friends, you are free. . . . But you must try 
to deserve this priceless boon. Let the world see that 
you merit it by your good works. Don't let your joy 
carry you into excesses. Obey God's commandments 
and thank Him for giving you liberty, for to Him you 
owe all things. There, now, let me pass. I have little 
time here and much to do.' " 

Great were the expectations of the newly- 
freed blacks. Some of them started North to 
the "promised land "; some expected to turn 
white. " Ole Miss," asked one pickaninny, 
," now I'se free, is I gwin' turn white lak white 
folks ? . . . I 'd ruther be white, Ole Miss." 
Washington was the place of miracles. When 
Uncle Peter went there, some tricksters told 
him his wool could be made straight, and his 
color changed. " Said dey could make it jes 
lak white folks' ha'r," he informed his mistress, 
mournfully, when he had paid the price — 
nearly his whole capital — and returned home 
with flaming red wool. His wife did not 
know him, or pretended not to, and drove him 
out of the house. One old colored lady, wear- 
ing her mistress's clothes, followed in the rear 
of Sherman's army in her mistress's carriage,

Sallie, where are you going ? " " Law,, honey !

The negroes fared better than most of the 
whites. They were the wards of the nation ; the 
whites were just then disfavored step-children. 
Colonels and generals came home to sell pies 
and tea and oysters, to make a bare living. The 
story of the poorer white people is told in the 
following incident : 

" A Northern missionary said in 1867, to a Philadel- 
phia audience, that he had seen in North Carolina a 



white mother hitch herself to a plow which her eleven- 
year-old son drove, while another child dropped into- 
the furrows seeds Northern charity had given. I saw 
in Virginia's Black Belt a white woman driving a plow 
to which her young daughters, one a nursing mother,, 
were hitched." 

The book is packed full of such incidents, 
illustrating every phase of domestic life among 
the Southern whites and blacks. As affording 
much material to explain the present problems 
of the South, the work is valuable, whether 
one accepts the author's conclusions or not. 
The numerous pictures of Southern women of 
the time cause one to reflect on the great change 
that has taken place in Southern ideas as to the 
publicity of women's names and pictures. Forty 
years ago it would have been a mortal offence 
to publish these portraits. Now, young women 
(except perhaps in Charleston) keep supplies 
of photographs for the society pages of the news- 
papers. Compare these pictures wdth those of 
the South Carolina legislature (p. 354), and the 
jury that indicted Davis (p. 238), and one has 
a long story without words. The book opens 
with a quotation from the last public speech of 
Jefferson Davis ; it closes with one from Presi- 
dent Roosevelt's Richmond address. Each in 
itself is proof of great changes in feeling since 
the days of which Mrs. Avary has so interest- 
ingly written. Walter L. Fleming. 



The Intimate IjIfe of Sir 
Henry Irving.* 



As Johnson had his Bos well, so it may well 
be said in years to come that Irving had his 
Stoker. And in justice to the gentleman last 
named, we may add that the statement is made 
from a literary point of view, with due considera- 
tion of the art of biographical portraiture : to 
exaggerate Boswell's weaknesses is perhaps im- 
possible, but the talents mingled with them have 
sometimes been underrated, and a paradoxical 
antithesis has been set up between the folly of 
the man and the greatness of his book. 

For upwards of thirty years the author of 
these Reminiscences was an intimate friend of 
Sir Henry Irving, in certain ways the most in- 
timate friend of his life ; and it is tridy said 
that he knew him as well as it is given to any 
man to know another. In a prefatory note 
Mr. Stoker points out that the fame of an actor 
is won in minutes, not in years, the latter being 
only helpful in the recurrence of opportunities ;

that it is not practicable to record adequately 
the progress of his work, for that in its perfec- 
tion cannot be recorded, as words can convey 
but faint suggestions of awakened emotion. 

" So much, then, for the work of art that is not 
plastic and permanent. There remains, therefore, but 
the artist. Of him the other arts can make record in so 
far as external appearance goes. Nay, more, the genius 
of sculptor or painter can suggest — with an under- 
standing as subtle as that of the sun-rays which on 
sensitive media can depict what cannot be seen by the 
eye — the existence of these inner forces and qualities 
whence accomplished works of any kind proceed. It is 
to such art that we look for the teaching of our eyes. 
Modem science can record something of the actualities 
of voice and tone. Writers of force and skill and judg- 
ment can convey abstract ideas of controlling forces and 
purposes ; of thwarting passions ; of embarrassing weak- 
nesses ; of all the bundle of inconsistencies which make 
up an item of concrete humanity. From all these may 
be derived some consistent idea of individuality. This 
individuality is at once the ideal and the objective of 
portraiture." 

Forty years ago, provincial playgoers did 
not have much opporttinity to see great acting, 
except in star parts. It was the day of stock com- 
panies. Mr. Stoker first saw Irving as Captain 
Absolute in '• The Kivals,'' at the Theatre Royal, 
Dublin, on the evening of August 28, 1867. 
It was nine years before, as dramatic critic on 
the " Dublin Mail," he met the actor. Their 
friendship began at a dinner, after which Ir\Tng 
asked permission to recite Thomas Hood's poem, 
'• The Dream of Eugene Aram." Stoker sat 
spellbound. Irving had foimd an understanding 
and appreciative friend ; and the friendship thus 
begun continued till the end of Irving's Hfe, 

In the present work the author has aimed not 
so much at a formal biography as to present a 
picture of his subject's life by showing him 
amongst his friends and explaining who those 
friends were, by affording glimpses of his inner 
life and mind as gained by intimate association. 
To trace Irving's career for several years after 
their first meeting is only to follow him from 
one .scene of triumph to another. During these 
years his one ambition was to have a theatre to 
himself where he would be sole master, an am- 
bition which was realized when he took the 
management of the Lyceum and made ^Ir. 
Stoker his acting' managfer. During Irvinsr's 
personal management of the Lyceum he pro- 
dueetl over forty plays, making an avei-age of 
two plays each year from 1878 to 1898. The 
memorable series of Shakespearean plays were 
a part of these. Xever before had such scru- 
pvdous attention been given to the detads of 
stage-production. Irving was always careful 
not to offend the feelings of the public, espe- 



cially in religious matters. For instance, when 
the church scene of " Much Ado about Noth- 
ing " was set for the marriage of Claudio and 
Nero, he got a Catholic priest to supervise it, 
who pointed out that the white cloth spread in 
front of the Tabernacle on the High Altar meant 
that the Host was within, whereupon Irving or- 
dered a cloth of gold ; when the red lamp hung 
over the Altar-rail by his direction, for purely 
scenic effect, was pronounced a sacramental sign, 
he replaced it by others to destroy the significance. 
But not so when, as Becket, he put on the pall to 
go into the cathedral, where the murderous 
huddle of knights awaited him. There were no 
feelings to be offended then, though the occa- 
sion was in itself a sacrament — the greatest of 
all sacraments, martjTdom. All sensitiveness 
regarding ritual was merged in pity and the 
grandeur of the noble readiness, ''I go to meet 
my King." 

Perhaps no successful play ever had so little 
"done for it as " The Bells "on its production. 
When Irving took the management of the 
Lyceum, this play was one of its assets. The 
original choice of the play is an object-lesson 
of the special art-sense of an actor regarding 
his own work. As Mr. Stoker points out, it 
would be difficult for an actor to explain in 
what this art-sense consists, or how it brings 
con^action to those whose gift it is. Irving's 
own views upon this interesting point are weU 
worth quoting. 

" It is often supposed that great actors trust to the 
inspiration of the moment. Nothing can be more erro- 
neous. There will, of course, be such moments when 
an actor at a white heat illumes some passages with a 
flood of imagination (and this mental condition, by the 
way, is impossible to the student sitting in his armchair) ; 
but the great actor's surprises are generally well 
weighed, studied and balanced. And it is this accumu- 
lation of such effects which enables an actor, after many 
years, to present many great characters with remarkable 
completeness. ... It is necessary that the actor should 
learn to think before he speaks. . . . Let him remem- 
ber, first, that every sentence expresses a new thought, 
and therefore frequently demands a change of intona- 
tion; secondly, that the thought precedes the word. Of 
course, there are passages in which thought and lan- 
guage are borne along by the streams of emotion and 
completely intermingled. But more often it will be foimd 
that the most natural, the most seemingly accidental, 
effects are obtained when the working of the mind is 
seen before the tongue gives it words." 

This chapter on "• Irving's Philosophy of his 
Art " is one of the most interesting in the entire 
book. 

Irving's first visit to America, in 1883, was 
a matter of considerable importance. At that 
time the great body of the British people did not

inow much about America, and did not care a 
great deal, according to the present author. 

" The welcome which Irving received on that night 
of October 29, 1883, lasted for more than twenty years 
— until that night of March 25, 1904, when at the Har- 
lem Opera House he said ' Good-bye ' to his American 
friends — forever ! Go where he would, from Maine to 
Louisiana, from the Eastern to the Western sea, there 
was always the same story of loving greeting; of appre- 
ciative and encouraging understanding; of heartfelt au 
revoirs, in which gratitude had no little part. As Ameri- 
cans of the United States have no princes of their own, 
they make princes of whom they love. And after eight 
long winters spent with Henry Irving, amongst them I 
can say that no more golden hospitality or affectionate 
belief, no greater understanding of purpose or enthusi- 
asm regarding personality or work, has ever been the 
lot of any artist — any visitor — in any nation. Irving 
was only putting into fervent words the feeling of his 
own true heart, when in his parting he said : ' I go with 
only one feeling on my lips and in my heart — God 
bless America ! ' " 

Another particularly interesting chapter is 
devoted to Ellen Terry, whose artistic life was 
so closely associated with Irving's. She is 
treated only incidentally, but is pictured as a 
^eat artist — the greatest of her time. 

In the closing chapter of the book, Mr. Stoker 
-explains the cause of Irving's ilhiess during the 
last seven years of his life. Here we learn for 
the first time the details of his patient suffering. 
Little wonder that, when the 13th of October, 
1905, came around, he was tired, tired out. The 
actual cause of his death was physical weakness ; 
and the last words he spoke on the stage were 
Becket's last words in the play : " Into Thy 
hands, O Lord I into Thy hands." 

That Sir Henry Irving had many rare and 
winning gifts of mind and soul ; that his impulses 
were right and noble ; that most of those who 
knew him best seem also to have loved him most 
dearly ; that his ambition, large as it was and 
growing with what it fed on, seldom if ever out- 
ran his honesty of purpose, or turned his proud 
self-reliance into uncharity and seK-conceit ; that 
he had his dramatic principles and never sacri- 
ficed them to a greed for wordly advancement ; 
that he had a fine scorn for hypocritical pre- 
tenses of every kind, and a fine sense of honor 
for himself, are convictions which are confirmed 
by Mr. Stoker's book. His candid Reminis- 
cences have opened the actor's life and character 
to the public. The wit, the wisdom, the anec- 
dote, the talk by famous men and about them, 
the strangeness and vivacity of many of the inci- 
dents and eminence of many of the characters, 
combine to render the work fascinating and in_ 
qructive. It is in two handsome volumes, ade 
uately illustrated. Ingram A. Pyle. . 



Canada Seex through English Eyes.* 



Nothing reveals more strikingly the changed 
attitude of Englishmen toward Canada than the 
space given to Canadian questions in contem- 
porary English literature. Scarcely a month 
goes by but one or more of the English reviews 
publishes an article on some aspect of Canadian 
life, political, industrial, or intellectual; the great 
London dailies, that not so long ago clipped 
a Canadian item here and there from the Asso- 
ciated Press despatches, now have their own cor- 
respondents in Canada; and not content with 
this, every now and then they send out a special 
correspondent to study conditions on the spot. 
These special correspondents, generally expe- 
rienced and well-informed journalists, have done 
a great deal to break down the wall of compla- 
cent ignorance that shut out the average En- 
glishman from any intelligent interest in Colonial 
affairs. Their letters are given a prominent 
position in one or other of the great daily news- 
papers, and are read not only in London but 
throughout the United Kingdom ; and finally, 
according to the established practice, they are 
gathered together in book form, and serve a 
further useful purpose as books of reference on 
contemporary conditions in Canada. 

Two such books are " Canada the New Na- 
tion," by Mr. H. R, Whates, and " Canada as 
It Is," by Mr. John Foster Eraser, both authors 
being well-known London journalists. The 
books cover substantially the same field, — that 
is to say, the Canada of the twentieth century, 
with its marvellous potentialities, and its young 
and vigorous people just awakened to the knowl- 
edge of a mighty future. The subject is one 
that must appeal irresistibly to the intelligent 
onlooker with the proj)er point of view. Both 
these observers have, on the whole, acquitted 
themselves creditably. They have studied Cana- 
dian questions and conditions on the spot, taking 
nothing at second-hand ; they have not contented 
themselves with the lifeless reports of govern- 
ment officials, but have gone among the people, 
always with the acute ear of the trained news- 
paper man, interviewing everyone from hod- 
carrier to cabinet minister, and recording their 
impressions while they were fresh and vivid. 
This method of writing contemporary history has 
its limitations, but these exist in any method. 

Mr. Whates was so anxious to get first im- 
pressions in his study of Canadian problems

that he " travelled steerage " from Liverpool to 
St. John ; tried snow-shovelling in St. John, to 
satisfy himself that an emigrant need not starve 
if stranded at that port in \sinter-time : spent a 
few days in a typical New Brunswick limiber- 
camp ; took up a free homestead in the Sas- 
katchewan Valley, to get in touch with the 
conditions to be faced by the would-be Canadian 
farmer : explored the northern clay-belt through 
which the new transcontinental railway is to 
run ; and admired the magnificent mountains 
and beautiful valleys of British Columbia. 

Of certain classes of Canadians and certain 
Canadian characteristics, !Mr. \NTiates has no 
very high opinion ; but for what he calls the 
" average Canadian of the prairie and the back- 
woods " he has nothing but praise. He finds 
him " a man whose virile character and keen 
intellect, bodily hardihood, self-dependence in 
isolation, heroic endurance of long, fierce win- 
ters, strength of will and patient courage in 
converting primeval wastes into a noble home- 
land, make him the typical figure of Canada, 
the New Xation." 

Mr. Whates has much to say as to the ad- 
vantages of the Dominion as a field for British 
emigration, but at the same time strongly, and 
justly, condemns the " indiscriminate emigra- 
tion of people who find themselves crowded out 
of the English labor-market and are weakened 
in physique and morale by long endurance of 
defeat in the battle of life in great cities." Of 
the American immigrant, he has the highest 
opinion. •• The American immigrant is a pio- 
neer, and accustomed to deal with new condi- 
tions and adapt himseK to them. He is a man 
of the plains — resourceful, self-reliant, and 
enterprising. And he often brings growing 
boys and girls with him — the best asset that 
Canada can attract, for what she needs mostly 
is young men and women. . . . He is, indeed, 
an aristocrat among Dominion immigrants ; and, 
it should not be forgotten, he is an English- 
speaking immigrant."' 

Mr. Eraser also has travelled far and wide 
throughout Canada. Gifted with a quick eye, 
and the wide if not always very deep knowledge 
of the experienced journalist, he has produced 
an entirely readable little volume. It appears 
that for some years he has made a carefid study 
of Canada, its growth, its possibilities, and its 
sentiments toward the parent country and the 
United States. It is a trifle surprising, how- 
ever, to find such cai-eful preparation resulting 
in statements like this : •' In Alberta Territory 
and Vancouver Province, where there is little 



snow, there are nasty, chill, and continuous 
rains." Alberta is now a province, though no 
doubt it was still a territory when Air. Eraser's 
book was written. There is not now, and never 
has been, a Province of Vancouver. Mr. Eraser 
no doubt means British Colxmibia. The " nasty, 
chill, and continuous rains " might apply to the 
rainy season on the coast ; certainly nothing of 
the kind is found in Alberta. But these are 
only the trifling faidts that must creep into any 
similar attempt to handle a big subject rapidly 
and in small compass. Air. Eraser's discussion 
of Canadian political and social problems is in- 
teresting, if not always convincing. The same 
criticism applies to jMr. \^^lates's treatment of 
the same problems. The advantages of an out- 
side point of view are obvious, but no journalist 
with only a superficial knowledge of conditions 
in another country can hope to probe success- 
fully the depths of its political and social life. 
Mr. Eraser's remarks upon the growing spirit 
of " Spreadeagleism " in Canada are timely, and 
should prove a wholesome corrective. Canada 
is just now entering upon that period of early 
manhood — may one call it national hobblede- 
hoyhood ? — which is so trying to older coun- 
tries. The United States went through the same 
exasperating period some time ago ; and Cana- 
dians, if they are wise, will profit by the lamen- 
table experience of their American cousins. 

Both these books are provided with numerous 
illustrations from photographs, well selected, 
and with a distinct bearing on the text.

More Light ox the Philippixes.* 

Despite the slackness of popular interest in 
Philippine questions, industrious authors con- 
tinue to offer the public information on our 
Eastern possessions. Nearly all literary forms 
have now been tried — the narrative, the didae- 
tie, the geographical treatise, and most of all the 
statistical enquiry, to say nothing of the orator- 
ical outbursts with which the Congressional 
Record and the imaginative pages of campaign 
books are burdened. It has not been until the 
present time that the publication of" personal 
correspondence has been resorted to as a means 
of conveying solid fact to American readers who 
would be glad to shut the whole subject out from 
their thoughts.

the title of a large volume of letters written by 
Mrs. Campbell Dauncey to some unnamed cor- 
respondent in England. Covering 346 pages 
of good size, and treating easily of subjects vary- 
ing as widely as the mode of tariff administration 
under the insular government and the disagree- 
able traits of American office-holders, the book 
arouses some doubt in the mind of the reader as 
to whether the " letters " were written to some 
actual person or are merely a chosen literary 
form. The first letter is dated November 27, 
1904, the last, August 22, 1905. Mrs. Dauncey 
must have indeed been a constant correspondent 
to write in that time her forty-two letters aver- 
aging nearly ten pages of close print each. At 
all events, the product is an amusing, and at 
times extremely instructive, book for readers 
who have the slightest desire to be informed 
on Philippine events. Nearly every subject of 
popular interest in connection with Philippine 
matters is treated more or less thoroughly, in- 
cluding the trip of the Secretary of War and 
his party through the islands in the summer of 
1905. 

It is not a pleasant picture of Philippine life 
that Mrs. Dauncey draws. Particularly striking 
is the contrast developed in the first pages be- 
tween life at Hong Kong, with its orderliness, 
prosperity, and comparative comfort, and the 
high prices, vexatious taxes and tariffs, and un- 
cleanly ways of living encountered in Iloilo, the 
second city of the Philippines, where Mrs. Daun- 
cey spent most of her sojourn. There are chap- 
ters, too, upon Manila ; an interview with Mrs. 
Wright, the wife of the Governor ; and impres- 
sions of the city itself which do not differ ma- 
terially from those gained during the stay at 
Iloilo. Mrs. Dauncey's husband being the man- 
ager of an English firm engaged in business in 
the islands, her point of view may at times be 
regarded as colored by the alleged prejudice felt 
by English residents of the Phillippines toward 
the American regime there. The most apparent 
evidence of such a bias, and one of the worst 
blemishes upon the book, is found in frequent 
slighting remarks about conditions in the United 
States, a country which the author herseK has 
never visited. Barring several ludicrous blun- 
ders thus almost wilfully made, the letters stick 
with great faithfidness to conditions as person- 
ally observed, and have the touch which comes 
from direct observation. 

Briefly sunmiarLzed, and eliminating the bulk 
of incident and experience which chiefly give 
the volume its interest, Mrs. Dauncey finds the 
Philippines badly administered, without refer- 



ence to the needs of the population either native 
or foreign. The cost of living, instead of being 
low as in other Oriental countries, is abnormally 
high, even when judged by the standards of 
Western countries, and exceeds that of house- 
keeping in England. The natives, owing to a 
false standard of social relations set up by the 
American residents, are not only naturally lazy, 
like most tropical peoples, but have added to 
this normal laziness a contemptuous disregard 
of all regular methods of getting a living that 
involve real labor. Few opportunities to learn 
any useful trades or professions are afforded 
them, the education offered being academic in 
character, based upon the ideas developed in 
Western countries, and especially in the United 
States. Business in the islands, Mrs. Dauncey 
finds, upon the evidence of her husband and his 
friends, as well as upon that of stray American 
acquaintances, is in a languishing condition, and 
nothing is being done toward the development 
of the resources of the country. Officials, it is 
intimated, are largely incompetent, and in some 
cases corrupt, or maintain themselves by virtue 
of political favoritism. At times they appear 
(even some of those in relatively high positions) 
to be unfamiliar with the usages of ordinary 
polite society. Perhaps the most timely part 
of the book is the section which deals with Mr. 
Taft's visit to the Philippines and the disap- 
pointment of the natives at learning from his 
own lips that the promises and vague hopes of 
independence fostered during his former stay in 
the islands as governor cannot be gratified 
within any reasonable future time. The fol- 
lowing bit of conversation, reported by Mrs.. 
Dauncey as occurring at the close of the ball 
given in honor of the Secretary during his stay 
in Iloilo, summarizes a long and unusually 
graphic chapter describing Mr. Taft's sojourn 
at that place : 

" At the top of the staircase, I met a very Prominent 
Citizen, who remarked that this had been a great occa- 
sion for Iloilo. I said: ' He spoke a great many truths;, 
what he said was very straightforward.' 

"'Yes,' said the P. C, 'but he should have said all 
that two years ago.' 

" And that I find is the unanimous verdict of every 
class and nationality about Mr. Taft's subtle and rather 
tardy interpretation of the promises he made when he 
was Governor of the Philippines. Next evening, a 
Prominent Citizen of our acquaintance came walking^ 
past. * It was a fine show,' we said. ' AVhy, yes,' h& 
agreed ; ' I guess the Filipinos did their best for the 
Secwar.' ' I think he disappointed them, though,' said 
C. 'Well, I should smile; I guess Secretary Taft '& 
the best hated man in these islands now.' And that, I 
believe, is the unfortunate truth."

there can, unfortunately, be very little doubt. 
The outlines and the incidents are altogether 
too familiar to anyone who has had even the 
briefest Philippine experience. It is not likely 
that any responsible person will try to make 
rebuttal of the very serious criticisms of the 
American administration conveyed in this vol- 
lune. The personal character of the narrative 
and the limitation of the statements to actual 
observations and incidents leave the reader to 
draw his o\sti inferences, and the most that can 
be offered in answer is the stock insinuation of 
prejudice and bias which is even now heard in 
certain jjolitical circles as to this very book. 
Meantime, Mrs. Dauncey's amusing letters re- 
main as not the least count in the indictment 
of American rule in the Philippines.

Two VlSIOXAREES.* 



A great poet and a great novelist constitute 
the claim of present-day Italy to a leading place 
among the literary nations. Few other nations 
may claim as much — England certainly, Ger- 
many possibly, and Norway until a few months 
ago — so capriciously does the World Spirit be- 
stow the gift of genius. The fame of the poet, 
considered from the cosmopolitan point of view, 
must inevitably suffer from the impossibility of 
translation, and Sig. Carducci, venerated by his 
own people, is even to-day little more than a 
name to the rest of mankind. The fortune of 
the novelist is happier, for his work is suscep- 
tible of reproduction without serious impairment 
of its artistic quality, and the latest work of 
Sig. Fogazzaro has within a year found its way 
to the cosmopolitan public, and gained recog- 
nition as a masterpiece throughout the culti- 
vated world. In the very acceptable English 
version now given us, it naturally demands a 
more detailed consideration than we are accus- 
tomed to give the ordinary' novel, although 
even this tribute to its distinction does not suffi- 
ciently emphasize the fact that the work differs 
not merely in degree, but almost in kind, from 
books of fiction in the ordinary sense. In Italy, 
it is being acclaimed as ranking with " I Pro- 
messi Sposi," which is the extreme of all possi- 
ble praise.

prose trilogy which has occupied the author for 
many years. Lest this statement deter some 
readers from making its acquaintance, we hasten 
to add that the book is a fairly independent en- 
tity, to be enjoyed without a knowledge of its 
predecessors, although appreciation wiU doubt- 
less be made more complete by a preliminary 
reading of " Piccolo Mondo Antico " and 
" Piccolo Mondo Modemo." But these books 
have not yet, to our knowledge, been translated 
into English. In the first of them, one Don 
Franco Maironi gives his life for the cause of 
freedom. In the second, his son Piero, artist 
and dreamer, bound to one woman who is insane, 
and lo^Tbag another who is separated from her 
husband, runs the gamut of sinful passion and 
remorse and religious conversion, and disappears 
from the view of his associates. It is to this 
Piero Maironi, in his character of "the saint," 
that we are now introduced anew, after the lapse 
of three years devoted to austere practices for 
the chastening of his soul. Some acquaintance 
with his past, and \»-ith that of the woman who 
loves him, is of course essential to the vmder- 
standing of the situation now offered ; this diffi- 
cult}' has been skilfully dealt with by the nov- 
elist, who by means of allusion and suggestion 
puts us into possession of all we need to know, 
without for a moment making us feel that these 
retrospective glimpses are forced or inartistic. 
The reader who takes up " The Saint '' ex- 
pecting to find it a novel of plot and incident 
will be disappointed, and shoidd be warned in 
advance. While the work is not devoid of dra- 
matic passages, it makes no appeal whatever to 
the sensational instincts and resorts to no form 
of trickery. It is a psychological study of vsr 
rious types of Italian society, including within 
its scope the troubled seeker after truth, the 
worldling, and the peasant. It is a work pre- 
occupied with the fundamental problems of con- 
science and the innermost significance of religion.

pathetic introduction to the American public, 
groups it with " John Inglesant " and " Robert 
Elsmere "; holding it far superior to either by 
virtue of "its subtler psychology, its wider hori- 
zon, its more various contacts with life." The 
author has the temperament of a mystic, com- 
bined with the intellectual outlook of the ad- 
vanced modem thinker, and both these qualities 
are reflected in his hero. He is not blind to any 
aspect of reality, but he believes the most im- 
portant of realities to be those of the spirit, and 
this thesis he unswervingly defends. He be- 
lieves, moreover, that the Church is the di\'inely

instituted interpreter of God to man, and holds 
unassailable the rock upon which it is built, but 
he believes the Church to have been wounded in 
the house of its friends, to have suffered ossifi- 
cation in its frame, and paralysis in its vital 
activities. It suffers from the spirits of false- 
hood, and clericalism, and avarice, and immobi- 
lity. It opposes science, which means that it 
has lost faith in itself. " The Catholic Church, 
which proclaims itself the minister of Life, to- 
day shackles and stifles whatever lives youthfully 
within it, and to-day it props itself on all its 
decadent and antiquated usages." We do not 
wonder that the Curia, its faults thus relentlessly 
set forth, should have retaliated by including 
the book in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. 
HappUy, this is in our own days a futUe method 
of suppression, for so vibrant a voice as speaks 
to us from these pages is not to be hushed by 
ecclesiastical condemnation. 

In reading "The Saint" we have thought 
more than once of Ibsen's " Brand." Both 
works have the same tonic character ; both en- 
force the precept that a man consecrated to the 
Christian life should exemplify in every word 
and act, absolutely and uncompromisingly, the 
faith which he professes. We may refuse to 
grant the premises, but having once allowed 
them, there is no escape from the writer's logic. 
Again, we cannot avoid a comparison of this 
work with Zola's " Rome," or even with Mr. 
Caine's " The Christian," a comparison usefxd 
for its effective contrast between sincerity and 
sensationalism, between life and stagecraft. 
Such a comparison is made inevitable by the 
climactic episode common to the three books, 
the hero's interview with the Pope. The Saint's 
impassioned appeal to the Pontiff to drive the 
money-changers from the temple, to cleanse the 
Augean stables of clericalism, to turn his face 
from the past to the future, to welcome the con- 
quests of science, and to come forth from the 
Vatican into the world, constitute what is prob- 
ably the most eloquent section of the whole work. 
This is the programme which is put forward 
by the younger generation of earnest Italians 
who, unwilling to sever their relations with the 
Church, have acclaimed Senator Fogazzaro as 
their leader, and, in defiance of its condemna- 
tion, have accepted " The Saint " as a concrete 
embodiment of their ideals. A book that has 
such fortunes is more than a publication, it is 
an event. 

The coincidence that brings to us Pastor 
Frenssen's " Hilligenlei " and Senator Fogaz- 
zaro's " II Santo " at practically the same time 



is worth noting. It is not alone in the fact that 
these two men have recently become the foremost 
novelists of their respective countries that the 
coincidence occurs ; it is found also in the fur- 
ther fact that each has sought to express, in his 
latest work, the same essential idea. Wide as 
are the differences between the two men in both 
temperament and environment, great as is the 
diversity of the methods and materials they em- 
ploy, they have in common the same fundamental 
ideal of a regenerated faith, they voice the same 
protest against ceremonial and dogma, they 
make the same plea for the validity of the modem 
rationalized conception of religion, and they 
urge the same passionate defence of the spirit 
of Christianity against the ecclesiastical perver- 
sions that have come so near to stifling its breath. 

One does not discover all this in " Hilligenlei " 
(entitled " Holy land " in the translation) until 
well along in its pages. The fundamental im- 
pression which it is the author's purpose to pro- 
duce is created by a long succession of delicate 
touches, working upon the sub-consciousness of 
the reader, and gradually combining in cumu- 
lative effect. The story begins in a haphazard 
sort of way, introducing one character after 
another seemingly at random, and stringing 
together loosely related incidents of various 
sorts. All this is done with a deftness of delinea- 
tion, a faculty of vital observation, and a strength 
of homely sincerity that reveal evidences of 
mastery quite sufficient to hold our attention, 
but it is long before we realize that anything 
more is being offered than the contemplation of 
a group of simple human lives — humble peas- 
ants and sailor folk toiling for a precarious 
existence by the shores of the North Sea. It is 
some time before the reader can even determine 
which of the characters (growing up from child- 
hood under his eyes) is destined to be the real 
hero of the novel. As for plot, there is none at 
all for a while, and little enough afterwards, 
yet somehow the relations of these people whom 
we come to know so intimately slowly assume 
order and significance and beauty, until we see 
that a constructive ideal has been all along in- 
cluded in the author's plan. 

The motif of the work is introduced in the 
following words : 

" Roiind about the bay of Hilligenlei, at the foot and 
under the shade of the great sea dyke, clustered many 
little houses, in which dwelt laborers, fishermen and 
small farmers. Thesepeople, living extraordinarily lonely 
lives in their dark, low-roofed rooms, far away from the 
church, had from long time past brooded over a peculiar 
faith. They called themselves " Holyland men " and 
lived m the belief that the little town of Hilligenlei and 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



283 



the country round the bay would be one day a real 
Holyland. They looked for the Kingdom of God in 
the bay." 

This traditional faith, imperfectly conceived 
by most of the country folk, and often inter- 
preted by them in anything but a spiritual 
sense, at last finds lodgment in the soul of a 
sensitive boy. He dreams of it when a child, 
and broods over it in the reflective years of early 
manhood. And his soid is slowly shaped, by 
the rough ministries of the struggle for existence, 
of physical breakdown and unrequited love, to 
become, in some sense, an instrxunent for the 
fidfihnent of the old-time prophecy. His ma^- 
tured thought is embodied in these words : 

" Once more our nation is convulsed by the need of 
a renascence of the three great powers, to which itself 
gave birth, Authority, Religion, Custom; once more it 
is rent by the longing to return to nature, to the beauty 
of religion, of social justice, and a simple and genuine 
ideal of life." 

The culmination of this work is reached in a 
sixty-page chapter entitled " The Manuscript." 
The visionai-y who is the central figure of the 
story, after much soul-searching and tribuhv- 
tion, feeling that his end is near, elaborates a 
statement of the rationalized faith which is the 
final product of his meditations. This statement 
is in its substance a life of Christ, so narrated 
as to bring it into vital relations wdth the actual 
world. It is analogous, in some ways, to Count 
Tolstoy's analysis of Christianity, in others, to 
the work of those modem painters who have 
represented the divine figure in the guise of a 
modern man of the people. In whatever aspect 
we may regard it, this manuscript, bequeathed 
to his feUows by the dreamer of Hdligenlei, is a 
wonderfully impressive document, made so by 
its earnest sincerity and its poetic vizualization. 
It will be anathema to the official exponents of 
the Christian faith, but its teaching cannot fail 
to make a powerfid appeal to the open-minded 
and untrammelled seeker after truth. Those 
who are clear-sighted enough to perceive that a 
radical reconstruction of the forms of religious 
belief is inevitable, and even now impending, 
will welcome this attempt to disengage the 
essence of Christianity from its accidents.

Mr. T. Baron Russell indulges in some 
5r:p;.Sr V^-^^^^t dreams in his book, "A 

Hundred Years Hence" (McClurg), 
which will hold the attention of all disciples of 
Mr. Bellamy. Even regarded as the baseless fabric 
of a vision, the book has a certain fascination; but 
its forecasts are not without a foundation of scien- 
tific probability. In material progress we are picking 
up speed at an astonishing rate, so that fifty years- 
of the present era are better than a cycle of antiquity. 
In mental and moral advance, too, the author be- 
Ueves that we are moving at an accelerating pace ;; 
but here his predictions are somewhat less convinc- 
ing than when he confines himself to our material 
betterment. As to the latter, however, he seems to- 
err in some matters of detail. Discussing new sources 
of energy, he speaks of the end of the coal age as- 
" already well in view," whereas recent discoveries 
of rich veins, the likelihood of other such discoveries,, 
and more careful surveys of leads already being- 
worked, tend to push the evil day into the indefinite 
future. Some new and cheap method of decompos- 
ing water is expected by Mr. Russell to make avail- 
able this " inexhaustible supply of energy." Is not 
this the perpetual-motion fallacy in a new form ? 
The energy required to separate the oxygen and 
hydrogen in water can never be less than that de- 
veloped by their recomposition, just as the energy 
needed to vaporize water is never less than the power 
exerted by the steam in moving the engine, while 
the incidental waste of energy through f riction^ radi- 
ation of heat, and other forms of leakage, is very 
great. Water, even that of Niagara, is a medium, 
not a source of energj'. The author takes a some- 
what exalted view of the virtues of Americans, — 
as when he says : '' In America, where there i» 
practically no standing army, . . . the people are- 
conspicuous for manliness, for high endurance, for 
patience under the reverses of fortune, for tem- 
perance : and in the average of physical courage 
America far excels any military nation."

to delve deeply into the 644 pages that form the 
second volume of the '' Hai'vard Psychological Stu- 
dies," just appearing with the imprint of Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. ; yet if he did so he would 
certainly be interested in the description of the 
purposes and arrangements of the Psychological Lab- 
oratory in Emerson Hall, as set forth by its able 
Director, Professor Muensterberg. This appropri- 
ate introduction to the appearance of the Studies in 
a newer and more independent form is a desirable 
record of the purposes that inspired the erection of 
that building. In addition, a group of twenty-three 
special studies, dealing with widely different phases 
of the psychologist's pursuit, present an admirable 
survey of the spirit and the method of stating and 
answering problems which to-day animate this 
science. Technical though this be, and saturated 
with the data that the experimental scientist seeks 
and elaborates, it yet has its bearing upon the larger 
problems of life and mind that warrant the instal- 
ment of this discipline in a building devoted to the 
interest of the humanities. Such a set of studies 
likewise reflects the high place that has been accorded 
to the philosophical disciplines at Harvard, — a 
place that could have been achieved only by the 
services of such men as Professors James, Royce, 
Palmer, Peabody, Muensterberg, and a group of 
younger men quite ready and worthy to succeed in 
their turn. The reputation of American scholar- 
ship is something that is gradually achieving the 
appreciation it deserves; it is as a significant con- 
tribution to an important phase thereof, issuing from 
an inspiring centre, that these Studies make appeal 
to the wider public that cherishes the arts of culture.

thro' London petrated by the Kev. W. J. Dawson 
spectacles. jj^ j^jg pleasant book, "The Quest of 

the Simple Life," just issued in this country by E. P. 
Dutton & Co., some time after its London appear- 
ance. In form it is autobiographical, narrating the 
happy escape of a London clerk, after twenty years' 
drudgery in the city, to the free air and manifold 
delights of a horticultural, piscatorial, and literary 
life in the lake district. To heighten the verisimil- 
itude, minute details and tables of comparative 
expense (city and country) are scrupulously set 
down ; and the whole outcome is so successful and 
so satisfying in the reading that one wishes, with a 
brief but consuming desire, that one were a London 
clerk on a salary of £250, with a wife and two 
boys, just to repeat the experiment. But on recall- 
ing the writer's actual life-history, his early entry 
into the Methodist ministry, and his later successes 
in a Congregational pulpit and as a lecturer and 
writer, all these pleasing bucolic visions die away 
and fade into the light of common day. It is to be 
hoped that the seductive volume may not fall into 
the hands of any London-weary clerk who shall 
mistake its plausible fictions for the gospel truth 
hebdomadally preached by its author, and shall 
leave his friendly desk to court disappointment 



and possible starvation under wholly untried con- 
ditions. Apart from this half-innocent deception 
in its general tone and appearance, the book is to 
be commended. Most eulogists of the simple life 
seem to be ever peeping out of one corner of their 
eye to see whether the great world is taking proper 
note of their fine carelessness of its opinion. But 
Mr. Dawson is free from this offensive self-conscious- 
ness. A student of social problems, he has things 
to say about the evils of city life and the advantages 
of country life that are worth saying and worth 
reading. 

Mind and body : I" " ^^^in and Personality " ( Dodd ), 
an attempted Dr. W. Hanna Thomson presents a 
popularization, theme well worthy of popular treat- 
ment in the light of the extended knowledge of 
latter-day science. Such popularization requires, in- 
deed, a master-hand well versed in the bearings of 
concept and principle, and equally expert as a phy- 
siologist and a psychologist. It is perfectly true that 
the relations of mind and body have been measura- 
bly transformed by the researches of the foremost 
ranks of time ; and it is equally true that to render 
the results of such increased insight available to the 
lay mind is a worthy and profitable task. Dr. Thom- 
son's motives are well justified. It is much to be 
regretted that the performance falls so decidedly 
short of the promise of the title. Much of what is 
set forth is true and pertinent ; possibly more is of 
that " nearly true " order which is more pernicious 
than error itself ; so that on the whole, when the 
array of evidence comes to the test of an aperqu and 
a practical application, commendation is wholly out 
of the question. Prone upon slight provocation to 
deride metaphysics, the author is hoist by his own 
petard, and erects the personality into a figment of 
a crude philosophy, tliat suddenly becomes potent to 
explain what it feebly describes. In brief, popular- 
ization is a difficult art, and should flow from that 
fulness of knowledge, chasteness of spirit, and tact 
of expression that are reserved to a master of his 
craft. Volumes like the present, that fail of this 
through fundamental lack of fitness, do not aid the 
cause which they espouse with good faith and earnest 
intention.

By Eva Emery Dye. A Tale of Two Shores. With 6 drawings by Walter J. Enright. Price $1.50. 

The chance casting away of a party of Japanese on the Oregon coast many years ago inspired McDonald, a 
fully historical personage, to enact a similar drama in his own proper self with the characters and continents 
reversed. Landing on the shores of Japan he was passed from governor to governor until he reached the capital. 
There he was permitted to establish a school, and it was actually his pupils who acted as interpreters during the 
negotiations with Commodore Perry, generally supposed to be the first of Americans to enter Japan. Mrs. Dye 
has long been aware of the facts in McDonald's unusual career, having obtained them largely from his own lips ; 
but she deferred publication until his papers finally reposed in her hands. 

" Mrs. Dye's book is from the moment of its writing become a part of the undying history of our country. As captivating and 
stirring as any fiction is this work which tells a true and important chapter of the national history. It is more than biography, 
more than a bit of sectional reminiscence — it is national." — The Detroit Timet.

is a model of what such a study should be. The 
small size of the volume imposed severe restrictions, 
but on the whole these have made for good : the 
absence of padding and irrelevant matter of any 
kind is refreshing. The treatment is critical in 
the best sense of the term. Appreciation of the 
master's transcendant qualities goes hand-in-hand 
with equally keen realization of his limitations. 
Ardent admiration of his great achievements in 
portraiture is coupled with frank recognition of the 
essential wrongness in principle of his designs for 
decoration. Cogent reasons are given for rejoicing 
that such works as the wall-paintings in the council 
chamber of the Rathhaus in Basle have not survived. 
They could only have intensified the pernicious 
influence exerted by Holbein's marvellous vision 
and suberb draughtsmanship when misapplied in so- 
called ornament. As little is known with certainty 
about the detail of Holbein's life, the rival conjec- 
tures are set before the reader impartially, with the 
author's reasons for regarding one or the other as the 
more probable. Many, but not all, of the artist's 
paintings are passed in review. A notable omission 
is any reference to one of his most wonderful per- 
formances, technically considered, the "Young Man

Numerous illustrations, excellent in spite of the small

the Life of a French Royalist during the War in 
La Vendue, and of his Flight to Southampton, where 
he followed the Humble Occupation of Gardener." 
To prove the genuineness of these memoirs, a careful 
examination of the manuscript was made by M. 
Pierre Amedde Pichot, a scholar well equipped for 
such research. Advertisements, too, were printed 
in the leading historical and literary papers of En- 
gland ajid France, to recover, if possible, the lost

French original of this anonymous translation. As a 
result, the historical reality of this Count de Cartrie 
(incorrectly written " Comte de Castric " in the 
manuscript), and the truth of his Vend^ean and En- 
glish adventures, are reasonably established, — an in- 
quiry in which the abundant memoirs of the period 
proved useful; but the lost French original of the 
narrative has not yet ttirned up. Curiously enough, 
the English translation has now been re-translated 
into French for publication in France. To both En- 
glish and French versions M. Fr^d^ric Masson con- 
tributes an extended historical introduction, while 
the nameless translator's introduction is itseK added 
in an appendix — in the English edition, at least. 
Another appendix and eleven pages of fine-print 
notes are furnished by M. Pichot, many illustrations 
are interspersed, and an index completes the volume. 
As a tale of adventure, the work cannot fail to 
attract. It also has value as a side-light thrown on 
a memorable epoch in French history.

our country, — short geneaJogies, biographies, and 
reprints of important old books and documents. The 
first volume of the series is entitled " In Olde Con- 
necticut," and is written by Mr. Charles Burr Todd. 
It is made up of a series of essays pertaining to that 
State, collected from various periodicals where they 
first appeared, and put together without much con- 
tinuity or coherence, except that all bear some rela- 
tion to Connecticut. They vary in time from the 
days of the Pequot Indians to the beginnings of the 
Hartford and New Haven Railroad. Among the 
places described are Saybrook and Guilford, Groton, 
Mystic, New London, Fisher's Island, Mount Tom, 
Litchfield, and Greenfield Hill, together with the 
Burr Mansion and the Trumbull House. Among 
the legends re-told is that of the frogs of Windham 
and the " earthquakes " of Mount Tom. A chapter 
is devoted to the burning of Fairfield by the British 
in 1779, and another to the whaleboat privateers- 
men of those days. One of the best descriptions is 
that of the old Revolutionary prison at East Granby, 
near Hartford. The little book will prove of espe- 
cial interest to persons connected by birth or kinship 
with Connecticut, and will also be read with pleasure 
and profit by the general public. 



Art essays 
on Whistler 
and others. 



There is little about Whistler in Mr. 
Frederick Wedmore's " Whistler and 
Others" (Scribner). The essays and 
fragments that make up the volume are in part 
reprinted from various periodicals. Some of them 
seem hardly of sufficient importance to warrant the 
more permanent form. Easily the best are "The 
Place of Whistler " and " The Print CoUector." In 
these the author, who is well-known to a limited 
circle through his catalogue of Whistler's etchings, 
is on sure ground. He writes from the point of view

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



of the collector and connoisseur ; and the words of 
a man who has become an expert through the 
exhaustive concentrated study that successful col- 
lecting demands are worth listening to whether one 
always agrees with him or not. His assertion that 
the average citizen does not really care for art has 
evoked adverse criticism from reviewers who mistake 
languid interest for affection ; but it is true, never- 
theless, as every genuine art-lover knows. Mr. 
Wedmore's preface offers food for reflection on this 
point, and may be commended to those who doubt 
the statement. 

A traveller writing his impressions

the instruction or entertainment of 
his own countrymen. Not so Pastor Wagner, the 
genial and naive author of " The Simple Life," 
whose " impressions of America " (McClure, Phillips 
& Co.) are only too evidently written for Americans 
to read. M. Wagner has a great many friends in 
the United States, with President Roosevelt looming 
large among them. These friends will no doubt 
enjoy reading his unstinted praise of everything 
American. The book is, in fact, not much more 
than the equivalent of what in common parlance is 
called a " bread-and-butter letter " — the returned 
guest's thanks for courtesies received. From a lit- 
erary point of view, it is aljout nil ; as also from the 
point of view of the American who desires to see his 
country more clearly through the eyes of a stranger. 
In this respect it contrasts strikingly with the work 
of the famous French scholar, Hugues Le Roux, 
after his visit a year or two ago. Perhaps the au- 
thor intended it as an atonement or apology for his 
fellow countryman's lack of gallantry, especially 
toward American women. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"The Oxford Treasury of English Literature," of 
which the first volume has just been published by Mr. 
Henry Frowde, is a work designed " to indicate, as far 
as the limits of space permit, the chief landmarks in 
the progress of English literature." The plan of the 
work is to provide few but significant examples of En- 
glish verse and prose, accompanying them by a moderate 
amount of critical, biographical, and explanatory matter. 
The first of the three volumes which the work will 
comprise has for a sub-title " Old English to Jacobean," 
and is edited by Messrs. G. E. and W. H. Hadow. 
The work is admirably done, and wholly worthy of the 
distinction of its Oxford imprint. 

Messrs. Alden Brothers, New York, send us, in a 
volume of over six hundred pages, the complete Poems 
of Miss Amanda T. Jones. The book embodies all the 
author's previous works — " Ulah," " Atlantis," " A 
Prairie Idyl," and the lately-published " Rubaiyat of 
Solomon " ; and represents a full half-century of poet- 
ical achievement. Miss Jones's work has several times 
been noticed in The Dial, and commended for its sin- 
cerity, originality, and often forceful and felicitous 
diction. Many of her pieces have appeared in prom- 



inent magazines, and some of them have gained a place 
in standard anthologies among the best representatives 
of her country's poetical literature. Her old friends, 
and we hope many new ones, will welcome this com- 
plete collection of her poems. The volume has two 
portraits of the author, which, with the brief introductory 
sketch giving some intimate details of her early life and 
the influences that shaped her literary career, impart 
additional personal interest to the poems. 

The latest addition to the " Heroes of the Reforma- 
tion " series (Putnam) is a life of John Calvin, by 
Professor Williston Walker; and it is an excellent 
piece of work. Professor's Walker's previous work 
has shown that he is thoroughly equipped in the ecclesi- 
astical history of the Reformation period, and he has 
shown in this book the other qualities of a good biog- 
rapher. While by no means light reading, the book is 
clear and straightforward, and it makes the real man 
Calvin live before us his strange life, so far-reaching in 
its influence. The author has done this by giving special 
attention to Calvin's training, spiritual development, 
and constructive work, rather than to the minutife of 
his Genevan contests, or the smaller details of his rela- 
tions to the spread of the Reformation in the various 
countries. Twenty helpful illustrations add to the 
value of the book. 



Notes. 



« The Life of Christ Without- Within " is a volume 
which reprints two of Henry Ward Beecher's sermons, 
and is published by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

" Romola " is published by Messrs. Thomas Nelson & 
Sons in their " New Century " edition of George Eliot. 
The tasteful volumes of this edition are printed on thin 
paper and have covers of limp leather. 

The second American, from the eleventh English, 
edition of Anson's " Principles of the English Law of 
Contract," is edited by Professor Ernest W. Huffcut, 
and published by Mr. Henry Frowde at the Oxford 
University Press. 

Miss Eva March Tappan's " American Hero Stories," 
now pubhshed by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 
shares its title with an earlier volume by the same 
author, but is designed for child-readers of somewhat 
more advanced years. 

" On Newfound River," one of Mr. Thomas Nelson 
Page's pleasantest tales, has been enlarged by the author 
to the dimensions of a si2lable volume, and is now pub- 
lished in its new form, with illustrations, by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The Messrs. Putnam are publishmg a new edition, 
styled "Knutsford,"of Mrs. Gaskell's writings. "Ruth," 
"Cranford," and " Mary Barton " are the three volumes 
now at hand, each having an etched frontispiece and 
an introduction by Dr. A. W. Ward. 

" The American Jewish Year Book " for 5667, edited 
by Miss Henrietta Szold, is issued by the Jewish Pub- 
lication Society of America. The significant words 
stamped upon the cover, " From Kishineff to Bialystok," 
indicate the leading feature of the contents. 

" Moorish Cities in Spain," by Mrs. Walter Gallichan, 
is an addition to the " Langham Series of Art Mono- 
graphs," imported by the Messrs. Scribner. Cordova, 
Toledo, Seville, and Granada, are the subjects of the 
four chapters of which the little book consists.

THE DLAX

" Bridge, Abridged," by Miss Annie Blanche Shelley, 
is published by Messrs. Duffield & Co. It includes 
the revised laws adopted by the New York Whist Club 
and a chapter on the etiquette of the game. 

" At the Sign of the Sphinx," by Miss Carolyn Wells, 
gives us a second series, numbering over a hundred, of 
the rhymed charades which Miss Wells is so deft in 
composing. Messrs. Duffield & Co. are the publishers. 

« The §30,000 Bequest and Other Stories," by Mark 
Twain, is a stout volume containing matter new and 
old, selected from the miscellaneous writings of the 
himaorist. It is published by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

" The Pilgrim's Staff " is a pretty little anthology of 
" poems divine and moral," from Spenser to Stevenson, 
selected and edited by Mr. Fitz Roy Carrington, and 
daintily printed in old-fashioned style, with portrait 
illustrations. Messrs. Duffield & Co. publish this charm- 
ing little book. 

The increasing publication of plays in book form is 
an encouraging sign of the times. The Bobbs-Merrill 
Co. now send us Miss Meringtou's favorite " Captain 
Lettarblair," while from the Messrs. Harper we have 
" Kate : A Comedy," which is a new work by Mr. 
Bronson Howard. 

The H. M. Caldwell Co. send us four dainty booklets 
in flexible leather covers. The set comprises Ruskin's 
" King of the Golden River," Longfellow's " Tales of a 
Wayside Inn," Eric Mackay's " Love-Letters of a 
Violinist," and a volume by Dickens called " Sketches 
of Young Couples." 

A revised American edition of Professor J. M. D. 
Meiklejohn's " The English Language : Its Grammar, 
History, and Literature," is published by Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. This compendious work has been proving 
its usefulness for many years past, and in its present 
form will be found more valuable than ever before. 

An " Advanced Geography," by Mr. Charles F. King, 
is published by the Messrs. Seribner in their series of 
" King's Concrete Geographies." The inductive method 
is employed throughout, with results which contrast 
surprisingly with text-books of the older type. The 
illustrations are profuse, and include a number of rery 
attractive colored plates. 

" The Stress Accent in Latin Poetry," by Miss Eliza- 
beth Hickman DuBois, is published by the Macmillan 
Co. for the Colxunbia L'niversity Press. The aim of the 
writer has been " to establish an explanation of the 
purely quantitative Latin poetry which shall reconcile 
the opposing views as to an apparent clash between 
word accent and verse accent." 

The writings of Mr. Upton Sinclair, author of " The 
Jungle," have been thoroughly revised by him, and will 
be published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. during 
the autumn. The first to appear is " King Midas," the 
author's earliest book. Its original title was " Spring- 
time and Harvest." It will be followed by " The 
Journal of Arthur Stirling," for which the author has 
written a new preface. 

A new edition of " Christabel," illustrated by a fac- 
simile of the MS., and textual and other notes by Mr. 
Ernest Hartley Coleridge, is announced by the Oxford 
Clarendon Press. Fresh material has lately come to 
light in the shape of a fourth MS. copy, which has been 
collated for the forthcoming edition; while Mr. Cole- 
ridge's recent researches have enabled him to elucidate 
several interesfing points — topographical, chronologi- 
cal, etc., — connected with the poem. 



Thackeray's " Henry Esmond," edited by Professor 
John B. Henneman, is quite the dumpiest volume thus 
tar published in the " Pocket Classics " of the Mac- 
millan Co. It fills, with the notes, nearly six hundred 
pages, which is certainly good measure for the price. 
Emerson's " Representative Men," edited by Mr. Philo 
M. Buck, is also now added to this series. 

Additions to the " Red Letter Library " of the H. M. 
Caldwell Co. are the following: " Essays from the Spec- 
tator," edited by Mr. W. A. Lewis Bettany; " The Last 
Essays of EUa," with an introduction by Mr. Birrell; 
Keble's " The Psalter in English Verse," with an intro- 
duction by the Archbishop of Armagh; and a selection 
from Calverley's " Verses and Translations," with an 
introduction by Mr. Owen Seaman. 

" Zarathustra and the Greeks," a volume of lectures 
by Professor Lawrence Heyworth Mills, is a very im- 
portant new issue of the Open Court Publishing Co. 
A second volume is announced for later appearance. 
The same publishers send us a discussion of " Space 
and Geometry, in the Light of Physiological, Psycho- 
logical, and Physical Inquiry," by Dr. Ernst Mach, 
translated by Mr. Thomas J. McCormack. 

A biography of the late Mrs. Craigie (" John Oliver 
Hobbes ") is now in preparation. ^Ir. John Morgan 
Richards (56, Lancaster Gate, W., London) as his daugh- 
ter's executor, will be obliged if those who possess 
letters from Mrs. Craigie, or other materials likely to 
be of service, will entrust them to him. All documents 
so lent will be copied and returned without delay. 
Mr. T. Fisher Unwin will be the publisher of the work. 

A volume by Mr. Sidney Lee, entitled " Shakespeare 
and the Modem Stage, with Other Essays," will be pub- 
lished at once by the Messrs. Seribner. The book 
mainly consists of articles on various aspects of Shake- 
spearean drama which bear on current affairs. Most 
of the essays have been contributed to periodicals 
during the past few years, and they have now been 
thoroughly revised. A paper on " Aspects of Shake- 
speare's Philosophy " has not been printed before. 

One of the three posthumous volumes by " Fiona 
Macleod " has just been published in England. " Where 
the Forest Murmurs " is a series o% nature sketches 
written at different times and in different countries. 
The second posthumous volume, to be issued later — 
"The Immortal Hour" — will contain two tragic dra- 
mas; and the third will be a collected edition of poems 
old and new, written under the name of Fiona Macleod. 
Mrs. William Sharp intends also to arrange for publi- 
cation a selection from the three published volumes of 
verse by her husband — two of which are out of print — 
and to add to it a number of recent poems. 

The Bureau of Statistics and Mimicipal Library of 
the City of Chicago has for distribution a number of 
souvenir volumes, recently published for the League of 
American Municipalities. The contents of the volume 
comprise a review of Chicago's Administrative History 
from 1837 to September, 1906, by Hugo S. Grosser; 
a History of Chicago's Seal, by Dr. C. J. Cigrand; and 
a History of the League of American Municipalities, 
by John Mac Vicar. The volume numbers over 200 
pages, and contains full-page portraits of the most 
prominent mayors and a new map of Chicago. A copy 
of this important work may be obtained free of charge 
except twenty-five cents in stamps for the cost of pack- 
ing and carriage, by addressing Hugo S. Grosser, City 
Statistician, City Hall, Chicago.

It^s Time to Plan 

A California Trip 

THE season this year promises to be one of the 
greatest California has had. Those of you who 
have not been to California should write to the 
Chicago & North- Western Railway Passenger Depart- 
ment for a beautifully illustrated book on California. 
It will tell you what there is of especial interest to you 
in the Golden State — it will tell you about things you 
can do and see — things that will provide the best of 
midwinter recreation. 

Three splendid daily trains to California — the 
electric -lighted Overland Limited, via the Chicago, 
Union Pacific and North- Western Line; the electric- 
lighted Los Angeles Limited, via Salt Lake City and 
the newly opened Salt Lake Route; and the China & 
Japan Fast Mail — leave Chicago daily 
at 8.02 p. m., 10.05 p. m. and 11.00 p. m. 
through without change. 

All Ticket Agents sell tickets 
via this route.

294 THE DIAL [Nov. 1, 



KEEPING UP WITH THE AlAGAZINES 

without giving all one's time to them is a task of ever-increasing 
difficulty. CThis is decidedly the magazine age. The number, 
variety, and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than 
amazing. The master-minds of the world go to their making, — the 
greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month, with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library 
index. Everything is arranged and classified, simply but exactly; 
whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ- 
ers or merely looking out for good things in general, the arrangement 
is equally convenient. C. It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine- 
land, — a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell; 
and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person.

IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS 



THE FIRST FORTY YEARS OF WASHINGTON SOCIETY 

From the Letters and Journals of Mrs. Samuel Harrison Smith 
(Margaret Bayard). Editbd by Gaillard Hont. With numerous 
illustrations and portraits. 8vo, price $2.50 net. (Postage 20 cents.) 

REMINISCENCES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF 

Jefferson's Election, with the exciting contest with Aaron Burr determined by the casting of a single vote ; Jefferson at 
Home, both in Washington and at Monticello — an intricate personal study ; Madison's Inauguration and Inauguration 
Ball; Washington in the hands of the British (1814) ; Henry Clay — personal and political reminiscences and anecdotes; 
Jackson's Administration, and its political and social excitements (Mrs. Eaton, etc.) ; Webster's Reply to Hayne; Harriet 
Martineau's Visit to Washington ; Prominent Women of Washington Society, etc. 

A BRILLIANT volume of reminiscences covering an almost untouched period in the history of the social life at 
the Capital. The author was Margaret Bayard, who married Samuel Harrison Smith, the distinguished jour- 
nalist, who was the founder of The National Intelligencer, the oldest paper in Washington, and who by his position 
came in contact with the leading statesmen. She was a writer of books popular in her time, and consequently even 
the intimate letters to her family show decided literary grace and skill. Her life in Washington began with the 
nineteenth century, and closed in 1840. Jefferson, Madison, and Clay were among the intimates of her household. 
The literary foreigners who came to this country all went to Washington and viated Mrs. Smith and are described

FROM $175 TO $6 

If you were to subscribe for the English quarterlies, magazines, 
reviews, and literary, political, and scientific journals from which 
THE IiIVINO AGE takes its materials, they would cost more 
than S175. You would also waste a good deal of time in sifting 
out the important from the trivial, and determining what was 
really worth your reading. 

THE LIVING AGE practises this art of skipping for you, and 
gives you, for $6., in a single weekly magazine, light and easy to 
hold, the best essays, the best fiction, the best poetry, and all the 
most timely and important articles from this long list of 
periodicals, reprinted without abridgment. 

Six Dollars is not a large sum to pay for 3,300 pages of the best 
contemporary reading, covering all subjects of human interest, 
and embodying the freshest thought in literature, art, international 
affairs, and current discussion. 

THE LIVING AGE presents each year twice as much material 
as is contained in one of the four-dollar monthly magazines. As 
it has the whole field of English periodical literature to select 
from, it is able to present a wider range of subjects, treated by a 
more brilliant list of writers, than any single magazine, English 
or American. 

But you can buy a magazine for less money? Certainly. 
There are more magazines than one can easily count which may 
be had for one dollar a year each. 

But there are magazines and magazines. THE LIVING AGE 
presupposes intelligence and an alert interest in what is going on. 
To people of that sort it has ministered successfully for more than 
sixty years. It holds its field alone, and it was never more nearly 
indispensable than now. 

Subscribers for 1907 will receive free the remaining numbers 
for 1906.

THE 
SCHOOL REVIEW 

A Journal of Secondary Education 



THE HIGH SCHOOL AND 
THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE 

The importance of the field of secondary edu- 
cation is gaining increasing recognition. 
While the intellectual aspects of the high 
school may appeal more immediately to teach- 
ers and superintendents, the physical, social, 
and moral problems presented by the boy and 
girl at this period are matters of deep con- 
cern to parents, and to all who are interested 
in their welfare. 

THE SCHOOL REVIEW 

aims to meet the problems of this period of 
life and education. It believes that they can 
only be dealt w4th by bringing to the atten- 
tion of all the work of successful investigators 
or administrators, and by stimulating to deeper 
investigation those who are competent to deal 
with some phase of the broad situation. The 
Review imderstands its field to include all the 
problems that parent, teacher superintendent, 
or school board must face in dealing with this 
situation. On the one hand it will endeavor 
to be timely in bringing to the general atten- 
tion of the whole country whatever of interest 
or value is being done in any part. Import- 
ant discussions at educational gatherings will 
be reported and experiments in teaching or 
in administration will l^e described. At the 
same time it will be the purpose of the Review 
to study these topics not only in their more 
immediate bearings, but in their more fvmda- 
mental principles. The busy teacher or 
superintendent needs the help of the specialists 
in all educational fields, as well as the stimidus 
from others, who, like himseK, are face to face 
with the immediate aspects of the problem.

FJEJSR GYNT. 



Sometime in the middle eighties strange ru- 
mors, proceeding from the vicinity of Boston, 
were noised abroad. The cultured coteries of 
the American Athens had discovered, it seems, 
a new writer, a maker of plays in far-off Norway, 
who had startling opinions upon such cheerful 
subjects as hereditary viciousness, political cor- 
ruption, and the subjection of women. The mat- 
ter was investigated, and much agitation ensued. 
But such teapot-tempests of discussion had raged 
in those quarters before, and subsided without 
appreciable effects. In this case, however, to 
change the metaphor, there was fire beneath the 
smoke, and there arose a controversial confla- 
gration that was destined to spread far, to in- 
vade the woman's club, and the newspaper, and 
the pulpit, and to work something like a revo- 
lution in the theatrical world. For this Nor- 
wegian plajTight, whose then unfamiliar name 
is now upon as many lips as that of Shakespeare, 
was found to be a genuine thinker of iconoclastic 
temper as well as a consununate master of stage- 
craft, and his works have forced themselves upon 
the theatre through the sheer power of poetical 
genius allied with technical mastery, until now, 
some score of years after those early Botolphian 
rumblings, the foremost of American actors has 
crowned his significant career by an elaborate pro- 
duction of one of the Norwegian's two dramatic 
masterpieces, and has thereby done a great serv- 
ice to art, besides winning for himself a greener 
laurel than has hitherto adorned his brow. 

From the Ibsen of the eighties in America, 
allowed with fear and trembling an occasional 
experimental performance, to the Ibsen of our 
new century, revealed to eager throngs in the 
most elaboi-ate and sumptuous of settings, is a 
far cry indeed. It is an even farther cry from 
the diy light and the desiccated dialogue of " A 
Doll Home " to the glowing color and riotous 
poetic imagination of " Peer Gynt." For one 
thing, ^Ir. Mansfield's enterprise for the first 
time sets Ibsen before the theatre-going public 
in something like the right perspective. As we 
have been urging at many times for many years, 
the true Ibsen, the Ibsen who may fairly be 
accounted one of the great creative forces of the 
last century, is far less the author of the studies

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



of modem social life that have hitherto monopo- 
lized public interest in his work than the author 
of the two great dramatic poems, " Brand " and 
" Peer Gynt," with which that interest has been 
almost wholly unconcerned. Mr. Mansfield de- 
serves much gratitude for the conspicuous way 
in which he has now put the emphasis in the 
right place, and employed all the resources at 
his command for the proper presentation of a 
work compared with which Ibsen's social dramas 
of the later period are of trifling significance. 
The first production of " Peer Gynt " in the 
English language, which took place in Chicago 
a few days ago, must be regarded as a literary 
event of the first importance, and we make no 
apology for considering it in that light. 

We wish that it were possible to give hearty 
praise to the literary form in which the work 
appears, but that we are unable to do. Mr. 
Archer's translation, which is the basis of Mr. 
Mansfield's prompt-book, is very unsatisfactory. 
It preserves the rhythm of the lines in a rough 
fashion, but it makes no attempt to reproduce 
the rhymes, and the result is a sort of hybrid 
composition to which either good literal prose 
or free poetic paraphrase would be preferable. 
We know the difficidties attendant upon any 
kind of a translation of " Peer Gynt," and are 
well aware that an adequate translation is an 
impossibility; but something better than this 
might have been done with the text. Profes- 
sor Herford's extraordinary rhymed version of 
"Brand" gives us the example of what a really 
inspired translator might have made out of the 
companion work, and makes it clear that our 
demand is not a mere counsel of perfection. 
Furthermore, the most difficult scene in " Peer 
Gynt," the indescribably moving and pathetic 
scene of the death of Aase, has been translated 
by Mr. Gosse in a way that is marvellously 
reproductive of its poetical and emotional effect, 
and Mr. Mansfield would be well-advised to sub- 
stitute this version for the inferior one that he 
now uses of this particidar scene. It would bie 
so much of clear gain. For the rest, Mr. Archer 
fails at countless points to convey the poig- 
nancy, it may be, or the grotesque humor, or 
the acrid satire, of this passage or that ; in his 
version the keen edges have become dulled, and 
the gold transmuted into baser metal. 

In preparing his acting version of the play, 
Mr. Mansfield has been forced to take great 
liberties. To make of " Peer Gynt " a prac- 
ticable stage-drama a free hand was necessary, 
and we are not disposed to be unreasonable in 
our criticism. Remembering what he has done 



with Shakespeare and Schiller, we were pre- 
pared for a greater violence to the framework of 
the piece than was actually in evidence. The 
fact must be taken into account that a complete 
production of " Peer Gynt "is as impossible a» 
a performance in its entirety of either " Hamlet " 
or the second part of " Faust." Many pagea 
must necessarily be excised to bring the perform- 
ance even within the four-hour limit. Allowance 
must also be made for the further fact that 
Ibsen himself did not expect the work to appear 
upon the stage in the form in which he wrote it. 
He published it as a book, and hardly expected 
it to be produced at all. It was not until six 
or seven years later that he began to look at it 
from the stage standpoint, and then, when he 
asked Grieg to write the incidental music for the 
production, he outlined many changes from the 
printed text. He even went so far as to say 
that " almost the whole of the fourth act is- 
to be omitted in the performance," with the 
substitution of " a great musical tone-picture, 
suggesting Peer Gynt's wandering all over the 
world." He advised the omission of other scenes- 
also, and suggested various condensations in the 
text of scenes that coidd not be whoUy spared. 
Mr. Mansfield, in dealing with this difficult 
question, has adopted some of Ibsen's sugges- 
tions, but rejected others. His initial perform- 
ances included a number of scenes that were 
afterwards excised owing to the great length of 
the play. The first three acts are given with 
few cuts and with little shifting of parts. The 
fourth act, which Ibsen thought should be left 
out altogether, is represented by the scene upon 
the coast of Morocco, with the banquet, the 
stolen yacht, and the miraculous appearance of 
the emperor's white charger. To this is added 
a rather meaningless dance of Anitra and her 
attendant maidens, which Anitra has to explain 
in an interpolated passage, for the scene in 
which that designing young woman cajoles the 
masquerading prophet out of steed and treasure 
is not given at all. The Sphinx and Memnon 
episodes, followed by the scene in the mad-house 
at Cairo, are omitted. The momentary vision 
of Solveig, so reminiscent of Faust's vision of 
Gretchen in the midst of the Walpurgis night 
revelry, is transferred from its desert setting to 
a place at the opening of the fifth act. This act 
also suffers greatly from curtailment. We have 
the scene of the shipwreck, but not the subse- 
quent struggle in the water. The graveyard 
scene is omitted, as well as the suggestive scene 
in which Peer finds in an onion, with its many 
wrappings but no kernel, the symbol of his own 



1906.] 



THE DIAL

character. We are not given the symbolical 
scene of the yam-balls and the dead leaves and 
the broken straws, for practical reasons which 
are sufficiently obvious. With the entrance of 
the button-molder the closing scene begins, and 
this is condensed in a way that considerably 
impairs its logical force. Nevertheless, the out- 
come is wonderfully impressive. On the whole, 
our criticism on this score of condensation is di- 
rected not so much against the lengthy excisions 
as against the occasional omissions of certain 
pregnant phrases. Among such unaccoimtable 
omissions we note, in the scene of Aase's death, 
Peer's momentary and ventrUoquial assimaption 
of the character of God the Father ; in the scene 
on the coast of Morocco, after his yacht has gone 
to the bottom, his plaint to the effect that Divine 
Providence is anything but economical in its 
methods ; and in the scene with the button- 
molder, the latter 's words : " Both strength and 
seriousness are needed for a sin." 

The vast audiences that are filling the play- 
house nightly for week after week to witness 
this remarkable production must include many 
types of spectators, but so rich is the play in 
various kinds of interest that no one is likely 
to go away altogether unrewarded. At one 
extreme of appreciation we have the devotee of 
musical comedy and spectacular fable and at 
the other we have the lover of poetry and the 
seeker after ethical truth, and both may find in 
" Peer Gynt " something of their affair. For 
those whose dramatic ideal is found in " The 
Wonderful Wizard of Oz" there is the giant 
pig, and the ugly urchin, and the dance of the 
Arabian maidens, and the gorgeous scene at the 
court of the old man of the mountains. What 
better sport than this coidd the most frivolous 
ask ? For those who ask the stage to present 
an embodiment of poetry and pathos there are 
the Solveig scenes and the death of Mother 
Aase, accompanied by Grieg's inspired music. 
And for those who look to the drama for an 
envisagement of the deepest problems of char- 
acter and fate there are the striking symbolisms 
of Bojg and the button-molder, the contrasted 
philosophies of self-sufficiency and self-realiza- 
tion, and the stem enforcement of the only law 
by which a man may save his soul. Trxdy, here 
is a feast whereof the scraps alone would suffi- 
ciently furnish forth any ordinary dramatic 
banquet-table. 

Of Mr. Mansfield's personal part in the pres- 
ent noteworthy production we would say just 
this : He has seized the greatest opportunity 
offered by the dramatic literature of our time, 



and he has given us a characterization which 
outranks the best of his previous efforts. In 
no single work that he has hitherto attempted 
has he shown such histrionic versatility, and in 
none has he given us so complete a revelation of 
the deeper possibilities of his art. He has risen 
magnificently to a great occasion, and he has his 
reward. His own summary of " Peer Gynt " 
illustrates the completeness with which he has 
penetrated into the meaning of the poem, and 
may be suitably quoted as an appendix to our 
comment upon the performance. " This phan- 
tasmagoria, or comedy of hvunan life, embraces 
all the elements of the serious, the pathetic, the 
tragic, the grotesque, the real and the unreal, 
the actualities and the dreams, the facts and the 
consequences, the ambitions and the disappoint- 
ments, the hopes and the disillusions, and the 
dread and terror, and the resurrection in love, of 
the himian soul." 



THE HUNGER-MOTIVE IN FICTION. 

Poets are not plagiarists, but men are the same. 
The distribution of myths, the reappearance of inci- 
dent, the repetitions of history, all point, not to 
tradition or heredity, but to the rooted likeness of 
men and circumstance. Nature and humanity — 
this is the world ; and the world of art is like unto 
it. The works of this last world vary according to 
their intensity, their differing admixture of plot and 
character, and by the quality of soul in the creative 
artist which gives him his originality of thought and 
separateness of expression. 

Hunger is the great motive for the work of the 
world. Nearly all industries, warfares, adventures, 
displays of. wealth, social arrangements as far as 
property is concerned, are bottomed on this fact. 
Half the happiness or misery of mankind arise from 
it. The mere wUl to live expresses itself as hunger 
before conscious identity is established. And the 
old woman in " Punch," who, when her clergyman 
inquired of her what blessings she was most gfratef ul 
for during her long life, answered, " My wictuals," 
said a true thing. 

What would fiction do without eating and drink- 
ing? If I were asked to name the difference between 
dramatic and narrative art, I think I should say that 
it consisted in the way that respective poets feed 
their characters. Of course there are some pick- 
ings on the tables of the dramatists. The Thyestian 
banquet is at least mentioned in the Agamemnon, 
and in the Cyclops we almost assist at a similar 
cannibalistic feast. Shakespeare in general is a " poor 
provider," though the Duke feasts in Arden, and 
Macbeth sits down to the ghost-interrupted banquet, 
and Falstaff consumes at least one pennyworth of 
bread. If Shakespeare had had a real feeling for 
good living, he would not have let Petruchio fling 



312 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



the viands about as he did. No ; the di^amatists do 
not much condescend to eating. They can handle 
liquor very prettily. Don Juan drinks to the Com- 
mandante. The boors tipple in Auerbach's cellar, 
and Carl Moor and his comrades swig in the forest. 
But they do not fall to like honest trenchermen. 
Possibly it is because in a play they have not the 
time. A glass of wine can be tossed off in a second, 
but nobody would believe that a character could get 
through a satisfactory meal in the brief moment 
allowed by stage action. 

But the narrative poets and novelists ! What 
banquets, feasts, dinners, luncheons, snacks, they 
provide, primarily for their characters and second- 
arily for their readers' regalement ! To begin with 
Homer : his heroes are always eating, and we are 
even allowed to see the cooking of the huge joints 
of beef that nourish their mighty ardor. De Quincey 
found out that Odysseus ate four dinners in one 
night ! Probably he was laying in for a campaign, 
like the Esquimaux who eat enough blubber and 
whale-oil at one meal to last them a month. The 
old Irish epics reek with the kitchen smell. Their 
heroes fought magnificently for their cattle-spoils, 
and devoured them nobly. The worst reproach a 
bard could cast upon a man was to say that in his 
house " the guests did not grease their knives." 
Chaucer is a very lord of hospitality. One of his 
most amiable characters is the Frankelein in whose 
house " it snowed of meat and drink." Milton, the 
loftiest of poets, is liberal enough to Adam and Eve 
in the matter of fruits and nuts and such like food 
— rather cold comfort, one would think, though the 
Archangel partakes affably enough when he drops 
in to take pot-luck with our first parents. Keats's 
pretty " spread " in the " Eve of St. Agnes " reminds 
me of a supper I once sat down to after a long cold 
day's ride. It consisted of four kinds of cake, three 
kinds of pie, and a half-dozen different preserves. 
But Keats's meal was purely an aesthetic one, for 
the eye. It does not appear that the parties in in- 
terest partook of it at all. They tripped away into 
the night, and left the cates and dainties untouched 
in Madeline's chamber. 

After all, it is to the prose writers that we must 
go for the full fury and fervor of appetite and the 
satisfaction thereof. Petronius devotes nearly the 
whole of his book to Trimalchio's dinner. Some 
library-giving philanthropist should make this work 
accessible to the poor of all the world. There is 
enough food in it for an army. Reading it is as 
good as a meal, any day. One can say of the " Ara- 
bian Nights " that the people in it are great dinner- 
givers. They never meet together in a social way 
but someone claps his hands and servants appear 
with salvers laden with food. Of course, to a flesh- 
eating Northerner the temperate Arab's predilection 
for dates and figs and sherbets seems trifling. The 
celebrated Barmecide dinner is only their ordinary 
fare pushed to the extreme. Mention of this meal 
brings to mind that other state banquet where Sancho 
Panza, at the height of his felicity as governor of 



an island, has the dishes whisked away from him 
before he can taste them. Cervantes, indeed, is full 
of delightful episodes of eating, and though Don 
Quixote may have to discourse over a banquet of 
acorns, or Sancho gorge himself with cow-heel, they 
both make up for it at Camacho's wedding, where 
the squire is given a long fork and told to browse 
at large among the steaming cauldrons. 

Fielding and SmoUet, as befitted their lusty na- 
tures, gave their heroes large appetites and let them 
loose on an innkeeping world. Fielding even endows 
his heroines with a certain touch of that feeling for 
food which is probably out of the reach of the femi- 
nine soul. That supper — of stewed mutton, was it 
not ? — which Amelia prepared for Captain Booth 
deserves Thackeray's praise. Sir Walter Scott was 
hardly inferior as a trencherman to his predecessors. 
The scene where the pious Clerk of Copemanhurst 
first denies and then accords King Richard his hos- 
pitality is one of the decisive dinners of fiction. But 
the culinary gods of literature are surely Dumas 
and Dickens. Their books exhale, not the odor of 
Russia leather or celestial gums, but the fragrance 
of delightful cookery. We open one of them with 
the same feeling with which we approach a country 
inn at the coming of dusk, and see the windows 
glowing red and the gray smoke curling up from the 
chimneys. Nor are we ever disappointed. What 
a savory succession of viands do we enjoy ! What 
a motley and magnificent company of boon comrades 
do we meet ! How often have we lunched, guests 
unseen, with D'Artagnan and his comrades in the 
Bastion St. Gervais, or watched Chicot in the Paris 
tavern persuade Dom Modeste out of his fasting and 
his sermon ! How often have we been with Dick 
Swiveller and the Marchioness at their frugal meal, 
or looked on as Tom Pinch's sister made the meat 
pie ! But perhaps the full enthusiasm, the very rigor 
of the game of eating, is to be found, not in a novel, 
but in the " Noctes Ambrosianse " of Christopher 
North. This is the delirium of what Milton called 
" concoctive heat." As compared with other writers 
who imaginatively tickle the gustatory nerves, Wilson 
reminds me of the placard in a Western restaurant : 
" Dinner fifty cents; an immortal gorge, one dollar." 

Even Homer did not catalogue all the heroes on 
the plains of Troy, and I cannot begin to name the 
novelists to whom hunger and its satisfaction are 
sources of incident. In general, the keener the want 
the keener the zest of eating, both to the character 
and the reader. When one of Mr. Clark Russell's 
sailors, after tossing about for days in an open boat, 
climbs aboard a deserted ship, breaks into the store- 
room, eats his fill and takes an inventory of the 
provisions at hand, our mouths water in sympathy. 
The lists of provisions given in books of Arctic 
exploration are delightful reading, though no one 
would care to wade through a grocer's catalogue. 
In a higher way there are carefully-wrought scenes 
of hunger in fiction which impress us by their pathos. 
Jane Eyre's starvation on her flight from Thornfield 
Hall is one. The incident in Feuillet's novel, where 



1906.] 



THE DIAL, 



313 



the starving young nobleman takes a piece of bread 
which his sister is about to throw away, and tells 
her that he will give it to a poor man, is another. 
Starvation, indeed, is one of the long-suits of the 
novelist to engage our sympathy. 

Pestilence, disease, resulting as they mostly do 
from a lack of proper nutrition, are powerful agents 
of plot and situation. For the first, there is the 
Florentine plague which serves as a sombre back- 
ground to the gay scenes of the Decameron, the 
similar pestilence which is introduced into Manzoni's 
Promessi Sposa, and the death-scourge at Philadel- 
phia which is the main subject of one of Brockden 
Brown's novels, I think "Edgar Huntley." Disease 
in indiWduals is too common in literature to need 
specification. I wiU only name Andrd Chenier's 
poem, the Jeune Malade. Convalescence, too, which 
is a sort of new birth with a special, keenness and 
delicacy of appetite and sense, is a good theme. 
Thomas Gray has a poem on the subject, and there 
is a novel by Edmond About describing the recovery 
of a consumptive girl in the South of Europe which 
treats the matter with great charm. 

Wealth, which is a sort of concentrated food, or 
at least a safeguard against hunger, is an ingredient 
in most plots. The Argonauts sail for the Golden 
Fleece ; King Lear gives his property away and 
comes to grief ; the envious uncle does the Babes in 
the Wood to death in order to inherit their estate; 
the Nabob from India comes back in the nick of time 
to endow a heroine or rescue a scapegrace nephew, 
— obviously this branch of our inquiry is so large 
that one can only hint at it. Adventures to gain a 
fortune, treasure-seeking, and so forth, come under 
this head. Dumas's "Monte Cristo," Poe's "Gold 
Bug," and a myriad other stories, body forth the 
primal idea of wealth as a shield and a weapon. 
Perhaps " Robinson Crusoe " is the central book of 
the world in symbolizing the desirability of property. 
When Crusoe is cast away and has stripped the 
wreck of all available articles, he boasts that he has 
a greater stock of necessities than was ever gathered 
together for one man's use before. Yet he goes on 
building, planting, breeding, and is really the tj'pe 
of our race. Balzac is the novelist of modern times 
who has most realized the value of wealth. Money 
is the great theme of all his works. Other novelists 
and dramatic writers have made the miser a comic 
or despicable figure, but old Grandet is almost re- 
spectable. The getting of money with him is a duty 
and a religion. 

There are many figures in fiction that stand for 
the negation of wealth. The hermit idea is best 
embodied in the Hindoo epics and dramas ; but the 
Philoctetes of Sophocles, the Timon of Shakespeare, 
Scott's Black Dwarf, are European examples. Per- 
haps Thoreau's Walden may be accepted as our 
American contribution on this theme. Wars, con- 
quests, discoveries of new lands, colonizing, and such 
enterprises, are for the most part only larger exhibi- 
tions of the greed for wealth, the desire to make 
life secure. The multitude moves, instead of one 



man. The results belong to history rather than to 
fiction, but literatiire takes the historic legend for 
its own. The Pandu brothers, Herakles, Agamem- 
non, Caesar, Attila, Vasco de Gama, Columbus, — 
the names are endless of those who explore or 
struggle for dominion. 

There is a whole section of literature which deals 
with the growing of crops, the raising of cattle, the 
anntial replenishment of man's stock of food. The 
pastoral poetry of the world, the idyls of Theocritus, 
VirgU's Georg^cs, the Italian and English shepherd 
plays, are all based on this theme. Goldsmith's 
" Deserted Village " gives the idea in reverse. A 
thousand modern novels deal with the life connected 
with pastoral occupations. Half the charm of " Lorna 
Doone " resides in the pictures of farm-life — the 
corn waving on the hillside, the poultry cackling in 
the yard, the pigs fattening in the pen, aU of which 
edibles are to furnish provender for the mighty 
appetites of John Ridd and his compeers. The novels 
of Thomas Hardy also are full of such scenes. The 
sense of growing things pervades them all. 

The nomad life of hunting and fishing is almost 
equally represented in fiction. Rama and Sita and 
Laksmana in the Indian jungle, the Hunt in Calydon 
which has inspired more than one ancient and mod- 
ern tragedy, Der FreishUtz, Melville's "Moby Dick," 
— these are only a few instances. There is an 
American author of the past, who used to be called 
the " Shakespeare of nature-writers," whose hunting 
sketches and stories have a freshness and zest aU. 
their own. No one has expressed better than Frank 
Forrester the primal savagery of man in preying 
upon the lower creatures, his delight in hunting, 
tracking, killing, and eating his g^me. With our 
more recent nature-writers the bird or beast " sits 
not as a meat but as a g^est," which is more humane 
but hardly as true. 

Commerce has to do with tlie hunger idea also, 
as providing the means for distribution of earth's 
products. And with commerce come in the themes 
of houses, inns, cities, roads, rivers, the sea. And 
these themes bourgeon out into innumerable minor 
ideas of home, hospitality, journeys, highwaymen, 
voyages, pirates, and so forth forever. Science in 
use has provided weapons to fight hunger, and 
writers like Jides Verne and Mr. Wells have drawn 
inspiration from its inventions. 

Lastly in our category, there is the hunger of the 
earth and the hunger of the ocean. The earth, like 
Kronos, devours its own children, trees, vegetation, 
men, cities. This theme is best expressed in Gray's 
" Elegy " and Bryant's " Thanatopsis." The ocean 
finally devours the earth and all that is thereon. 
Cities which have slipped into the sea have furnished 
matter for many a legend and song, as have the 
stories of burned galleons and fleets. After the Duke 
of Clarence's vision in Shakespeare, Mr. Janvier's 
" Sargasso Sea " is the most wholesale and impres- 
sive treatment I can think of regarding this theme.

DEVIOUS METHODS OF BOOK ADVERTISING. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The " boom " spirit, of which the "Western town has 
often been said to have a monopoly, makes its appear- 
ance in strange surroimdings. A few evenings ago 
I was greatly enjoying that wise and himian book by 
Benson, "From a College Window." Under the spell 
of the thought and the charm of the style, I was living 
in another world from that in which hard material 
standards have so much sway, when suddenly I came 
upon the following passage: 

"I was reading the other day a sensible and appreciative 
review of Mr. Lucas's new biography of Charles Lamb." 

At the right of the last word in the sentence stood a 
figure ^ , an addition the more distracting because it was 
a reference to one of the only two foot-notes in the vol- 
imie. So, the spell of the book broken, I studied the 
note. It read: 

" E. V. Lucas : The Life of Charles Lamb. 2 vols. G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons, New York." 

The spirit of inquiry was now aroused, so I turned 
back to the title-page; then I realized that the enter- 
prising firm of publishers of " From a College Window " 
had seen, and seized upon, the opportimity to advertise 
another of its valuable publications. Into the midst of 
» bit of writing full of unworldliness, and formed by 
the artistic spirit, they had interjected a bit of commer- 
cialism. It was as if a salon picture had been exhibited 
with a "paster" on the centre of the canvas proclaim- 
ing its price and the name of the agent of sale. It 
reminded one — to compare small things with great — 
of Lowell rudely awakened from his twilight reverie in 
the Cambridge fields by the patronizing appeal of a 
German beggar. If such a use of books for advertising 
purposes is imassailable by any but a squeamish criticism, 
may we not expect that some day the foot-notes of our 
volumes of essays or of poems, perhaps even of our 
manuals of devotion, will contain such sprightly refer- 
ences as: 

" Why not buy ' The Fighting Chance ' when you take your 
next railway journey? D. Appleton & Co. $1.50." 

" Our readers will welcome more ' Dissertations by Mr. Doo- 
ley.' Harper & Brothers. $1.50." 

" The book to which the author refers is one of our publica- 
tions, a complete price-liat of which will be sent on receipt of a 
two-cent stamp." 

One cannot help wondering how Mr. Benson, lover as 
he is of a good book, and thoroughly contemptuous of 
whatever would debase it, would treat such a turn-a- 
penny intrusion upon his readers' peace and satisfaction.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



The timidity of American poetry is a quality 
pointed out and commented on by an English critic in 
a London journal. This lack of confidence, often ap- 
pearing under the guise of sentimentality, is attributed 
partly to the fact that our poetry is no spontaneous na- 
tional song, but rather voices " the traditions of a race 
which, by the time when American poetry can first be 
taken seriously, had become an alien and distrusted 
race"; and partly is it ascribed to the Calvinism that 
forms an element in the American temperament. It is 
this want of assured poise in us as a young people that 



was years ago well characterized and in part accounted 
for by Dr. G. Stanley Hall in a little book written on 
his return from a sojourn abroad. But we have pro- 
gressed since then. With the development of national 
consciousness and conscience come larger literary free- 
dom and independence, and one day we shall wake 
up and feel no more afraid of the older families of our 
kind across the water. Walt Whitman, of all our poets, 
was least afraid of them, and they seemed to like him 

the better for it.

The impracticability of international drama 
is stoutly maintained by that competent critic, Mr. 
William Archer. " Every nation," he contends, " must 
hold up its own mirror to its own soul — else is the 
theatre a mere plaything, an article of luxury." And 
again: " As a general rule, only third-rate, conventional, 
machine-made plays are capable of exportation." But 
Mr. Archer has just been paying a visit to Berlin, where 
he finds that one can see more of Shakespeare on the 
stage than in London, and at least as much of Ibsen as 
in Christiania; and he also discovers that Bjornson, 
Strindberg, Maeterlinck, Oscar Wilde, and Mr. Bernard 
Shaw are all, in a greater or less degree, naturalized on 
the Berlin stage. We must hold — and it is hard to 
believe that Mr. Archer would seriously dispute it — 
that the best in dramatic as in other literature has some- 
thing of the universality of light and air, of blue skies 

and of the mind of man. 

• • • 

The lake-dwellers' civic pride will be gratified by 
Mr. Frederic Harrison's remarks on Chicago in his new 
book, "Memories and Thoughts." He says: "Chicago 
struck me as being somewhat unfairly condemned as 
devoted to nothing but Mammon and pork. Certainly, 
during my visit, I heard of nothing but the progress of 
education, university endowments, people's institutes, 
libraries, museums, art schools, workmen's model dwell- 
ings and farms, literary culture, and scientific founda- 
tions. I saw there one of the best equipped and most 
vigorous art schools in America, one of the best Toyn- 
bee Hall settlements in the world, and perhaps the most 
rapidly developed university in existence. My friends 
of the Union League, themselves men of business proud 
of their city, strongly urged me to dispense with the 
usual visit to the grain elevators and the stockyards, 
where hogs and oxen are slaughtered by millions and 
consigned to Europe, but to spend my time in inspecting 
libraries, schools, and museums. No city in the world 
can show such enormous endowments for educational, 
scientific, and charitable purposes, lavished within ten 
years, and still unlimited in supply." Really, we are 
getting on ! It is not so long ago that another English 
traveller disposed of Chicago by a single line in his 
book on America : " I did not visit Chicago, — why 
should I care for pig-sticking f " Why, indeed ? It has 
long puzzled the people of Chicago to tell why the 
tastes of so many English visitors should run that way. 
We are glad at last to have become objects of interest 
to a class who, like Mr. Frederic Harrison, have an eye 
for something besides pigs.

The printing of new plays is urged upon English 
and American playwrights by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones 
in " The Theatre Magazine " for October. German and 
French plays appear in book form as a matter of course, 
and are often in the hands of the public before their 
presentation on the stage. " Surely in France," writes 
Mr. Jones, "the art of acting, as well as the art of the

drama, stands upon an immeasurably higher level than 
in England; and this is partly due to the differentiation 
in the public mind of the art of the drama from the art 
of acting. Both are judged in their due relation to each 
other, add both are judged on their respective merits 
instead of being carelessly muddled together. And in 
weighing the advantages and disadvantages which would 
accrue to the actor were every play to be published 
simultaneously with its production, he may be asked to 
reflect that the printing and reading of plays tends to 
raise the intellectual level of the drama, and with it the 
intellectual quality of the acting and the intellectual 
status of the actor. Xo actor who respects and loves 
his art . . . can consistently object to the immediate 
publication of a play on the eve, or on the morrow, of 
its production." A movement is noted on both sides of 
the Atlantic toward the publication of English and 
American plays, and a leading Xew York publishing 
house has imdertaken to issue some of Mr. Clyde Fitch's 
<lramas. Several of our college professors of English 
are furthering this movement by putting their classes 
through a course of lectures and examinations on cur- 
Tent plays of the better sort. Of course the theatre 
managers and syndicates constitute a power to be reck- 
oned with in effecting this innovation, but their opposition 
may be overcome here as it has been elsewhere.

Blunders of translators are again going the rounds 
•of the literary journals. Old wood to burn, old wine to 
drink, old friends to trust, and old jokes to laugh at. 
Along with the ancient tested and approved absurdities 
in this department of whimsical literature are cited sev- 
eral more modem instances. " La Dernifere Chemise de 
I'Amour " (" Love's Last Shift ") is classic ; but " Frappd 
ou Mademoiselle" as a rendering of the title of the 
farce " Hit or Miss," and " Le Ministre Assassin " as an 
equivalent of " The Stickit Minister," may possibly still 
iave a flavor of novelty to some readers. Groldsmith's 
line " As ocean sweeps the labored mole away " (from 
^' The Deserted Village ") is said to have been Gallicized 
by one of these ingenious mistranslators, " Comme la 
mer d^truit les travaux de la taupe." Truly, the per- 
formances of the literal translator are almost as amusing 
as those of the phonetic speller. 
• • • 

The humor of Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson is an ele- 
ment of his art that might well have received at least 
a passing word in Mr. Hellems's appreciation recently 
published in these columns. It is a humor that is as 
modestly unobstrusive as it is quietly enjoyable — to 
the reader who is content to be amused without burst- 
ing five buttons off and tumbling in a fit. The opening 
•of Arthur Ellis's slap-dash harangue in "A Modern 
Symposium " is an illustration, especially when taken 
in connection with the immediately preceding speech. 
" This," he begins, "is an extraordinary discovery Wilson 
has made, that fathers have children, and children fa- 
thers ! One wonders how the world has got on all these 
centuries in ignorance of it. It seems so obvious, once 
it has been stated. But that, of course, is the nature of 
^reat truths; as soon as they are announced they seem 
to have been always familiar. ... It is the privilege 
of genius to formulate for the first time what everyone 
has been dimly feeling." Humor, too, of a grim sort, 
imparts flavor to this same Wilson's somewhat aggres- 
sively arrogant assertions. " What else the state can 
do," he says in the course of his address, " it must do 
by education; a thing which, at present, I do not hesi- 



tate to say, does not exist among us. We have an 
elementary system of cram and drill directed by the 
soulless automata it has itself produced; a secondary 
system of athletics and dead languages presided over 
by gentlemanly amateurs ; and a university system which 
— well, of which I cannot trust myself to speak." With 
the humor of the book there is a sufficiency of wit to 
keep sweet the temper of this many-voiced discussion, 
La which the reader watches with curiosity and amuse- 
ment " one biulding after another laboriously raised by 
each speaker in turn, only to collapse ignominiously at 
the first touch administered by his successor." 

• • • 

The perfect type of city-lover, we take it, was 
Charles Lamb. His was " a mind that loves to be at 
home in crowds " ; and to such a mind, he tells us, even 
the mud of London is pure gold. Quite natiirally, then, 
we should look for much of Lamb in an anthology 
celebrating " The Friendly Town," and particularly so 
when the compiler happens to be so devout an Elian 
as Mr. E. V. Lucas. There is a good deal from Lamb 
in Mr. Lucas's pretty volume, but the selections seem 
to us for the most part irrelevant. One searches in 
vain for the first passage that inevitably comes to mind 
when one thinks of Lamb and London: 

"The lighted shops of the Strand and Fleet Street; the 
innumerable trades, tradesmen, and customers, coaches, wag:- 
grons, playhouses; all the bustle and wickedness round about 
Covent Garden ; the very women of the Town ; the watchmen, 
drunken scenes, rattles ; life awake, if you awake, at all hours of 
the night ; the impossibility of being: dull in Fleet Street ; the 
crowds, the very dirt and mud, the sun shining upon houses and 
parements, the print shops, the old bookstalls, parsons cheapen- 
ing books, coffee-houses, steams of soups from kitchens, the 
I>antomimes — London itself a pantomime and a masquerade — 
all these things work themselves into my mind, and feed me, 
without a power of satiating me. The wonder of these sights 
impels me into night-walks about her crowded streets, and I 
often shed tears in the motley Strand from fullness of joy at so 
much life." 

If there is not in this, and other similar passages from 
Lamb not made use of by Mr. Lucas, the very essence 
of the urban spirit, where may it be found ? 

• • • 

Limited editions of standard authors offer en- 
couraging testimony of those authors' continued vogne, 
at least among the more well-to-do, despite the not in- 
frequent purchase of these sumptuous sets for purposes 
of show rather than use. Such editions of Dickens and 
Stevenson are now annoimced. The elder novelist's 
works, in a " National Edition " of forty volumes, in- 
cluding more than 130 pieces now first collected, are 
issued by Messrs. Chapman & HaU of London, who 
began to publish for Dickens seventy years ago. The 
pictures, 850 in number, comprise all the original draw- 
ings, with other illustrative matter. Forster's life of 
the author is also included. The edition is "strictly 
limited to 750 sets for England and America," and the 
English price, with the English fondness for the odd 
penny, is just sixpence over half a pound per volume. 
All this is weU enough, except that the raking and 
scraping together of hitherto uncollected (and, inferen- 
tially, unimportant) matter is of doubtful wisdom. The 
Stevenson enterprise, imdertaken by Messrs. Cassell & 
Co. with the sanction of all parties legally concerned, 
and with Mr. Edmund Gosse as editor, is more generous 
in the fixing of its limit — 1550 copies, at ten guineas 
each, being promised. The speedy rise in price of the 
Edinbiu'gh edition of twelve years ago appears to ensure 
the success of this new and, as may be hoped, equally 
excellent issue of a popular author.

An English Journalist in Paris.* 



Baudelaire, as quoted by Mr. Sherard in 
prefacing his " Twenty Years in Paris," used 
to say, " J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais 
mille ans." For one with only the twenty- 
second part of a thousand years to look back 
upon, this Englishman in Paris is surprisingly 
fertile in reminiscences, and also, it may be 
added, almost as garrulous — in an entertaining 
fashion — as one might imagine Baudelaire's 
hypothetical millennarian to be. He says he 
is conscious " that many people have been left 
unnamed who ought to have been named, and 
that many things have not been told which 
ought to have been told." But his five hundred 
large pages of recollections will do very well for 
a young man, and we can patiently wait awhile 
for the many people and the many things here 
omitted. In fact, it would not be hard to point 
out some omissible passages even in the present 
volume, as, for example, this sage reflection near 
the beginning : 

" Slanderers are a very contemptible race. Indeed, 
their very practice and infamy are confessions of their 
own inferiority. The harm they do is incalculable. 
Few people there are who have not cause to regret 
having listened to their evil tales about their contem- 
poraries." 

This ostentatious avoidance of gossip is a famil- 
iar and amusing feature in both talkers and 
writers. However, the author has done himself 
no serious discredit in the present instance ; and 
though he is fond, perhaps pardonably fond, of 
advertising his own foresight after the event, 
and nothing loth to represent himself as enjoy- 
ing the friendship of great men before as well 
as after they had achieved greatness, the whole 
narrative moves so briskly, the dialogue is car- 
ried on by so many and so interesting actors, 
the stage is so crowded, and the scenes succeed 
one another so quickly, that it would be unhand- 
some to feel otherwise than friendly toward the 
purveyor of so much varied entertainment. 

Mr. Sherard is too well known in the world 
of letters to need many words of introduction 
here. He says of his entrance into journalism : 

" It was by mere accident that having come to Paris 
to lead a life devoted to literature and to study, and to 
seek the companionship and instruction of the g^eat 
minds in the capital of the world's intellect, I was drawn 
into the vortex of journalism. I had no training for this

Literary Life. By Robert Harborough Sherard. Illustrated.

life; my sympathies were altogether elsewhere; I was 
at home rather in the study than in the antechamber* 
of notoriety ; it has, indeed, always been only by a strong 
effort that I have been able to bring myself to those acts 
of importuning others which the profession of reporter- 
exacts. For the foreign correspondent is, in the first 
place, a reporter." 

Yet he appears bravely to have overcome his 
diffidence. On another page he declares, " There 
is one excellent thing about the new journalism,, 
and that is that it dispels all false modesty^ 
When one has either to do or to ' get left,' and 
when to get left usually means to die of hunger,, 
one develops remarkable energy in the assertion 
of one's personality." Yes, and the more 's the 
pity. Of the notabilities that figure most con- 
spicuously on Mr. Sherard's ample page, we will 
name de Lesseps, Zola, Daudet, Oscar Wilde,, 
the ill-fated Ernest Dowson, and Mr. Edison. 
Our author's literary leanings are sufficiently 
indicated by his ardently-expressed admiration 
of Zola and Mr. George Moore. As Paris cor- 
respondent of a new York paper, Mr. Sherard 
called upon de Lesseps, in 1887, to question 
him on the subject of the Panama Canal. What 
the great promoter is reported to have said has 
a present-day interest. 

" ' I am as full of confidence as ever. If you are a 
shareholder in the Panama Company, let me advise you 
to put your shares away in a safe, and to bolt and bar 
them in. We shall open our canal at the end of 1889, 
after the Exhibition here, or at the very latest at the 
beginning of 1890. That is certain. I say it and I mean 
it. What was the reason of the recent fall in the shares ? 
The manoeuvres of certain rogues, speculators of course,, 
who trade on the pusillanimity of the shareholders.' " 

A few words from M. Eiffel, another and a, 
more fortunate director of great engineering 
works, will interest statisticians, and others also. 

" ' It has been ascertained by statistical observation 
that in engineering enterprises one man is killed for 
every million francs tliat is spent on the work. Thus, 
supposing you have to build a bridge at au expense of 
one himdred million francs, you must be prepared for- 
the death of one hundred men. In building the Eiffel 
Tower, which was a construction costing six million and 
a half, we only lost four men, thus remaining below the 
average. In the construction of the Forth Bridge, fifty- 
five men were lost in over forty-five million francs' worth 
of work. Here the average is much exceeded ; but when 
the special risks are remembered, this number shows as- 
a very small one, and reflects very great credit on the 
engineers for the precautions which they took on behalf 
of their men.' " 

The author appears to have made a slip just 
before this in making the same speaker say, in 
reference to this bridge, that " the number of 
workmen who were killed during the carrying 
out of the work was much below the ascertained 
average."

THE DIAL

To pass from the fashioning of iron to the 
shaping of sentences, here is what the younger 
Dumas said to \Ir. Sherard on the subject of 
literary style, when the name of Jules Verne 
had been introduced : 

" ' I am trying to get the Academy to recognize his 
merits. I am pushing his claims to be admitted. Bat 
why will he live au bout du monde f Why does he live 
in Amiens ? " Les absents ont toujours tort," and the 
fault that they find with him is that his style is bad, 
that he has no style, as if that were not a contradiction 
in itself. To have no style is to have a good style. 
Dumas had no style. I have no style. Style is a neces- 
sity only to the writer who has nothing to say.' " 

In vindication of Maupassant's true-hearted- 
ness and warmth of affection, the author wTites : 

" As a matter of fact, those who knew the intimacies 
of Guy de Maupassant's life, knew of a love story in 
which he had shown himself the most impassioned of 
wooers, and of lovers the most ardent and faithful. It 
was my privilege to have in my hands a collection of 
love-letters written by him, and I sometimes regret that 
I did not consent to make use of them for publication. 
They were models of the style, and I do not think that 
de Maupassant ever surpassed in any of his works the 
beauty of this prose." 

Mr. Sherard makes himself a bit tiresome 
with his excessive admiration for Oscar Wilde, 
about whom he has elsewhere written so fidly. 
He also enlarges on the part he took in enlight- 
ening the world as to Captain Dreyfus's inno- 
cence and in predicting its ultimate vindication. 
And this naturally brings in Zola, and the 
author's stanch advocacy of the French realist's 
claim to greatness long before England would 
consent to tolerate him. A little less insistence 
by Mr. Sherard on his own courage and perspi- 
cacity in this matter woidd have sufficed. Yet 
his self-complacency is not unpardonable. 

The author's style is, of course, journalistic, 
but not pronouncedly so. He could study meth- 
od and brcNaty with advantage. An occasional 
Gallicism, as the use of the definite article with 
abstract nouns, is not surprising in an author 
who has lived so long among Frenchmen. The 
occiirrence of " ridded," " frightened of," " mid- 
dle of the ages," '• gazetteer " (meaning jour- 
nalist), here and there attracts attention, even 
though the writer may be guilty of nothing 
worse than an unusual or an obsolete form. 
But when he writes of an " argument ab im- 
probabile" and then two lines below, as if to 
prevent any charitable ascription of this " im- 
probable " Latin to the compositor, speaks of 
" arguing ab improbabile,'' he exposes himself 
to the critic's shaft. And when he makes Mr. 
Edison say of electricity, "It is a mode of mo- 
tion, a system of vibrations. A certain speed 
of vibrations produces heat ; a lower [ours the 



italics] speed, light ; still lower something else," 
— he represents either Mr. Edison or himself 
as deficient in the very rudiments of molecular 
physics. On one page he says of the murderer 
Aubert's kindness to animals, " This character- 
istic has been often noticed in those who have 
no kindness for their fellow-creatures." But in 
a later chapter he declares, apropos of Mme. 
Bemhardt's alleged cruelty to a pet cat, " I 
don't think that there is ever anything very 
wrong about a man or woman who is kind to 
animals." Two descriptions, fortunately brief 
and as inoffensive as such descriptions could 
well be, are given of executions, a triple and a 
double one, at which the author was present ; 
yet it is in reference to scenes of this sort that 
he gravely writes : " When the law affords such 
disgusting spectacles as the slaughter of a hu- 
man being, it can hardly be expected that the 
better and humaner classes will be represented 
amongst the spectators." He does not, however,^ 
make it appear that his own presence was on 
either occasion indispensable, and with reference 
to one of them he distinctly says that he attended 
to oblige a friend. 

The book has eight portraits of well-known 
Frenchmen, and two facsimile letters, a charac- 
teristic one from Mr. Eidison and one of grapho- 
logical interest written by the murderer already 
mentione<l. But to leave off with something 
pleasanter than murder, let us give a bonmot as 
quoted by Mr. Sherard. " A very distinguished 
man " was once asked that tiresome question, 
" K you were to be allowed only one book, what 
book woidd you choose ? " " The Book of Job," 
was the reply. " And why ? " persisted the 
curious questioner. " To learn patience when 
worried with foolish questions."

comprehend better, to-day, the thought of the 
man who declared, 

^' I have said that the soul is not more than the body, 
I And I have said that the body is not more than the 
, soul, 

And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's 
self is." 

And now our debate is over the point whether 
or no the thing that has been said, with the 
manner of saying it, is poetry. It will be 
thought significant by some that in the volume 
of carefully selected verse published last year by 
our best-known Boston book house, a volume 
entitled "The Chief American Poets," Walt 
Whitman was given a place, and on equal 
terms, with our recognized classic group ; and 
now we receive from the same firm a very note- 
worthy life of Whitman, written by Mr. Bliss 
Perry, the editor of " The Atlantic Monthly." 
Surely, it may be said that the " good gray 
poet " is at last coming to his own ! 

Walt Whitman, however, came to his own 
:a long time ago. For, in spite of the divergent 
-views so frankly and so emphatically expressed 
hj opposing camps, it is doubtful if any other 
verse-maker ever received more immediate and 
more illustrious recognition along with much 
forthright and vigorous abuse. The opposition 
was natural enough, was indeed to be expected ; 
the applause was so notable that it is worth 
recalling. Mr. Emerson's impulsive but per- 
fectly sincere letter of 1855, with its memorable 
*' I greet you at the beginning of a great career," 
is of course remembered by everyone. Let us 
quote Mr. Perry here, with reference to the wider 
recognition : 

" While Burroughs and O'Connor argued, and Whit- 
man read by his new astral lamp or tramped the streets 
with Peter Doyle, some of the most subtle of the 
younger English critics were finding in Leaves of Grass 
a new world of poetry. Frederick W. H. Myers, then 
a, fellow of Trinity, read from the book to John Adding- 
ton Symonds, an Oxford man of brilliant mind and deli- 
cate body, who listened with ' thrills to the very marrow 
of his bones.' Edward Dowden, Tyrell, and other young 
Irish scholars were reading it in Dublin. William Bell 
Scott the artist, who had received a copy from Thomas 
Dixon ' the cork-cutter,' Ruskin's friend, introduced it 
to the notice of Swinburne and W. M. Rossetti. It will 
be remembered that Emerson had sent a copy to Car- 
lyle, ten years before. Thoreau had sent one to his 
friend Cholmondeley, and a few other copies had found 
their way to England. But here was a band of clever 
tiniversity men, scholars and poets of a new generation, 
who became convinced of Walt Whitman's claims to be 
the representative poet of democracy." 

Add to this the fact of Thoreau 's enthusiasm, 
the subsequent pleasant interchange of social 



fellowship between Whitman and Emerson, the 
intimate appreciation of Burroughs, the friendly 
criticism of Matthew Arnold, the cordial words 
from Tennyson, to say nothing of German, 
Danish, and French endorsement, and we have 
an expression of approval that must have been 
balm indeed to the poet whose work had been 
described, characteristically, in " Putnam's 
Monthly " as " a compoimd of the New England 
transcendentalist and New York rowdy." 

As it is largely on the intrinsic merit of 
" Leaves of Grass " that Whitman's place and 
fame depend — in his own estimate surely, as 
in that of the critic's, — it will be especially 
interesting to readers of the new biography to 
see what this author has to say with reference 
to that important work. Thus does he set forth 
Whitman's idea: 

" Very deliberately, as was his manner in all things, 
this ruminative and unpractical carpenter began to plan 
an extraordinary thing — a book which should embody 
himself and his country. All that he had experienced 
was to be a part of it; the life which he had hitherto 
caressed casually, as one touches now the cheek and 
now the hand of the beloved, was to yield itself wholly ; 
to lose, as it were, its own individual existence, and to 
reappear as a Book, but a Book with all the potencies 
of life so coursing in it that it should seem not so much 
a Book as a Man." 

There is an interesting study of Walt's pe- 
culiar measure, and his embarrassing manipu- 
lation of the device of catalogue ; a discussion 
of the peculiarities of rhythmic prose and the 
influence of writers like Blake, Macpherson, 
and Tupper (in his "Proverbial Philosophy") 
on the methods of this new bard ; but most 
significant of all, Mr. Perry thinks, was the 
publication in 1851 of a " Lyrical Soliloquy," 
by Samuel Warren, entitled " The Lily and the 
Bee," in which the curious reader finds a com- 
plete prototype, in most of its pecidiarities, of 
" Leaves of Grass." That the poetry of Whitman 
is to be read as declamation, or rhapsody, is in- 
sisted upon. " To interpret as formal song what 
was intended as rhapsodical speech is to misread 
Walt Whitman." 

Now, what of the finished product ? To quote 
Mr. Perry again, — 

« As by the ebb and flow of the tide, the universal 
frame of things thus becomes flooded with personality: 
in one moment thmgs are made anthropomorphic, and 
in the next men and women are de-personalized into 
scarcely sentient flesh. Never was there a stranger 
pantheism, — flexible, reversible at will. The ' Song of 
Myself is full of sexual imagery, and the constant shift- 
ing of the word ' I ' from its individual to its symbolic 
meaning — that is, from the actual Walt Whitman to 
the typical human being whom the • I ' is often used to 
represent — frequently gives this sexual imagery a 
startling character. The human body is stripped bare ; 



1906."!

and in the emotional frenzy which masters the poet, the 
conventions, and occasionally the decencies, are clean 
forgotten. Yet these passages, offensive as they will 
always be to the fastidious, — ' it is as if the beasts 
spoke,' said Thoreau, — sprang from a profound sense 
of the germinal forces of life. It was a Titanic en- 
deavor to express the spirit in terms of the flesh. It 
was predestined to partial failure, not only because that 
feat is so insuperably difficult, but also because Whitman 
was after his fashion a philosopher and prophet as well 
as a poet, and this was a task calling for pure poetry." 

In his final chapter, " After Fifty Years," 
the writer includes the following suggestive 
paragraphs : 

"To appreciate Leaves of Grass as a product . . . 
of Transcendentalism, one should read it, not after a 
course in Nietzsche and Ibsen, much as they enforce 
and illuminate its teaching from various points of view, 
but after Carlyle s Sartor Resartus and Emerson's Essays 
and Thoreau's Journal. Its eccentricities, like its noble- 
ness, are a part of the sansculottism and the exaltation 
of the time. ... It would be unfair to say of Whitman, 
as Emerson did of Gibbon, ' The man has no shrine ; a 
man's most important possession.' He had altogether 
too many shrines. Monist as he was in philosophy, he 
was a polytheist in practice: he dropped on his knees 
anywhere, before stick or stone, flesh or spirit, and 
swore that each in turn was divine. He would have no 
liierarchy. The lesson of gradation, taught by the very 
stars in their courses, he would not learn. TTie gentle- 
man was no higher than the man, the saint no finer 
product than the sinner. With a soul that instinctively 
cried 'Glory! Glory!' he nevertheless did not perceive 
that the glory of the terrestrial was one, and the glory 
of the celestial was another." 

The foregoing passages — and for the pur- 
poses of this brief review we have restricted our 
citations to those paragraphs in which the au- 
thor deals with this most important and typical 
of Whitman's compositions — are sufficient to 
show that Mr. Perry's critical judgment is 
calm, sane, and discriminating. His attitude is 
friendly always, at time^ enthusiastic, although 
never that of an enthusiast ; he never slips his 
moorings, critically. His comments are bright- 
ened, too, with an occasional flash of quiet 
Yankee humor, revealing the presence of elec- 
tricity in the atmosphere without any roll of 
thunder following ; as when he says, for instance, 
of the poet : 

" He is often like a yard-man coupling parlor-cars 
whose names are rich in individual associations — 
Malvolio, Manitoba, Mazzini, Manchuria, Maria. But 
however excitedly those musical names are ejaculated, 
this does not start the train." 

In its presentation of Walt TMiitman's pic- 
turesque personality, ^Ir. Perry's book is, as it 
could not fail to be, delightfully entertaining. 
The frankness which appears judicially in the 
criticism of the poet's work is found also in the 
narrative of his life. 

There are many vivid glimpses of this demo- 



cratic figure, this powerfully assertive soul — 
always assertive, always democratic — from the 
days of early childhood when the sturdy, fair- 
skinned, black-haired yovmgster tumbled in the 
clover by the small weather-beaten house where 
he was bom, listening to the phoebe bird, 
smelling the lilacs, complacent, absorbing these 
things — 

" And the third-month lambs and the sow's pink-faint 
litter, and the mare's foal and the cow's calf," 

and all the vegetable and animal and human 
life aroimd him, — from these days of earliest 
youth to the time of old age in the squalid 
Camden cottage, the exit, the nightfall, and the 
good-bye. It would be easy to linger over the 
details of this unique life, but Walt Whitman's 
compelling figure has long since made itself 
familiar, — here, leisurely strolling through the 
New York streets, now surveying the human 
comedy from the top of a Broadway omnibus, 
or looking out from the pilot-house of a ferry- 
boat on the busy panorama of the East River, 
— this free-hearted warm-blooded caresser of life, 
lover of man, comrade of pilots and car-drivers, 
volunteer nurse, stalwart, health - breathing, 
bending over the tortured bodies of sick soldiers 
in the tainted atmosphere of crowded hospitals, 
bending and touching — with a hand like a 
woman's for tender ministration — the pain-tom 
bodies, saying comfortable things, bestowing his 
little gifts, taking the last message, kissing the 
dying boy : we remember the picture of Walt 
in war-time. He himself writes these things to 
his mother, his plain, wholesome, " perfect " old 
mother ; how affectionately he writes to her. 
Later, in the cloudy days, his health broken by 
the hospital service, depressed by the attacks of 
" malignant virtue," he writes again to her from 
Washington : 

"I pass the time very quietly — some evenings I 
spend in my attic — I have laid in wood and can have 
a fire when I want it — / wish you teas here." 

How natural it is to turn rhapsodist over this 
singer and lover of the universal ; but the editor 
of " The Atlantic " does not rhapsodize, nor 
does he represent a cult. " The close atmos- 
phere of a cult is not healthful for anybody," 
he says ; and shows its bad effect on Whitman 
in old age. The true lovers of Whitman wiQ 
welcome this clear, sincere interpretation of their 
prophet all the more warmly for its conscien- 
tious frankness and its dispassionate tone. How- 
ever realistic the study, in the presence of such 
a portrait one can but echo the words of Lincoln 
when he first saw Walt Whitman : '* Well, he 
looks Hke a MAN!"

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



We cannot better end our account than by 
allowing the author of this admirable biography 
in his own words to summarize the poet's mes- 
sage and its claim on the interest of posterity. 

" Upon the whole the most original and suggestive 
poetic figure since Wordsworth, he gazed steadily, like 
Wordsworth, upon the great and permanent objects of 
nature and the primary emotions of mankind. Of the 
totality of his work one may well say, ' The sky o'er- 
arches here.' Here is the wide horizon, the waters 
rolling in from the great deep, the fields and cities 
where men toil and laugh and conquer. Here are the 
gorgeous processionals of day and night, of lilac-time 
and harvest. The endless mystery of childhood, the 
pride of manhood, the calm of old age are here ; and 
here, too, at last is the 

' Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,' 
the hush and whisper of the Infinite Presence. These 
primal and ultimate things Whitman felt as few men 
have ever felt them, and he expressed them, at his best, 
with a nobility and beauty such as only the world's 
very greatest poets have surpassed. Numbers count for 
nothing, when one is reckoning the audience of a poet, 
and Whitman's audience will, for natural reasons, be 
limited to those who have the intellectual and moral 
generosity to understand him, and will take the pains 
to do so. But no American poet now seems more sure 
to be read, by the fit persons, after one hundred or five 
hundred years."

The liOifG Story or a Short Oration.* 

In a period of so extensive an output of books 
as prevails at present, literary coincidences are 
to be expected ; but rarely have three books 
appeared simultaneously, bearing upon so minor 
an incident as the delivery of an address, strictly 
occasional, by a man who was not a noted orator. 
The occasion referred to was the dedication of 
a portion of the Gettysburg battlefield as a 
cemetery ; and the speaker was President Lin- 
coln. This Gettysburg speech, occupying barely 
thirty lines of type on an ordinary page, has be- 
come a classic, declaimed in the schools and used 
as a model for the rhetorician. The events con- 
nected with its delivery have consequently as- 
siuned an unusual importance. Of the three 
authors whose books, treating these events, are 
now before us, one weaves the incidents into 
the form of fiction based presumably on fact ; 
another approaches the topic as a historian deal- 
ing with collected materials ; while the third 
writes reminiscently, having been officially con- 
nected with the exercises.

Lincoln at Gettysburg. By Clark E. Carr, author of " The 
mini," etc. Chicago: A. C. McClurg & Co. 



The fiction calls for no extended comment. 
It appeared first in one of the popidar maga- 
zines. " The Perfect Tribute " on the Gettys- 
burg speech is rendered directly to Lincoln, in 
a Washington hospital, by a wounded soldier 
who had read the address in a morning news- 
paper, — the President having been accidentally 
called in to draw up a will for the dying man. 
The basis, if any exists, for the improbable story 
is not known to the reviewer ; but if the author 
has taken as many liberties with it as with the 
facts regarding the delivery of the address itself, 
it may well pass for pure fiction. The special 
train from Washington to Gettysburg is made 
to start in the morning instead of at noon. Mr. 
Everett is placed on the train with Mr. Lincoln, 
instead of coming directly from Boston. Mr. 
Lincoln is made to write his speech on a scrap 
of wrapping-paper on the train, although that 
story is known to be apocryphal. He " leans 
slouchingly," and " slouched back across the 
platform " at Gettysburg, as he may have done 
in his early days in a country court-room. Mr. 
Everett is made to congratidate Lincoln imme- 
diately after the conclusion of the address in 
words which he really wrote to Lincoln the fol- 
lowing day. However, leaving veracity out of 
consideration, it must be confessed that the little 
story is written with a tenderness of touch and 
a delicacy of diction which make it delightful 
reading. 

The second book, " Gettysburg and Lincoln," 
by Mr. Henry S. Burrage,is best described as an 
unofficial history of the steps taken to preserve 
the battle-field, preceded by a brief sketch, with 
diagrams, of the three days of battle. The sketch 
is weU written and to the point ; it takes no part 
in the many controversies arising from the con- 
duct of the opposing armies, and treats Con- 
federate and Federal alike in matters of praise 
or censure. The bulk of the volume is devoted 
to the work of the Memorial Association which 
had charge of the field in 1893, and the National 
Park Commission in control since that date under 
Congressional appropriations. Various states 
contributed $835,625.55 to the purchase and 
ornamentation of the 1380 acres in the reserva- 
tion, and this sum has been supplemented by 
an almost equal amoiuit from Congress. In the 
chapters devoted to the dedication exercises. 
Major Burrage has followed contemporary ac- 
counts, and these differ in many particular* 
from the personal recollections of Colonel Carr, 
which form the material of the third book of our 
group.

Memorial Association, and occupied a place on 
the platform at the dedicatory exercises. After 
a lapse of half a century, his remembrances of 
the occasion are griven to the public in a book- 
let which is a tasteful specimen of the art of 
printer and binder. He invites confidence in 
his recollections by confessing in certain in- 
stances that he did not observe or cannot recall. 
He accepts the Xicolay statement that half the 
address was written before Lincoln started from 
Washington and the remainder in Gettysburg 
on the morning of the dedicatory day. Mr. 
Burrage inclines to the story that the address 
was fully blocked out in Washington and re- 
WTitten in Gettysburg during the evening after 
Lincoln's arrival. Both authors reject the story 
that he wrote it on the train, or on his hat held 
in his lap while Everett was speaking. Mr. 
Burrage accepts the reportorial interpolations 
of "Applause " and " Long continued applause " 
as evidence that both audience and speaker were 
satisfied with the effect produced by the address. 
Mr. Carr, however, hints that these were inven- 
tions of the reporters, " Except when he con- 
cluded,"' he says, " I did not observe it [the 
applause], and at the close the applause was 
not especially marked." He also says : '• Time 
and again, expressions of disappointment were 
made to me. Many persons said to me that 
they woidd have supposed that on such a great 
occasion the President would have made a 
speech." This disappointment is ascribed to the 
brevity of the speech, to the confusion attend- 
ing the coming of the President to the front of 
the platform, and to the impression that he was 
uttering commonplaces — nothing new which 
was not self-evident. " So short a time was 
Mr. Lincoln before them that the people coidd 
scarcely believe their eyes when he disappeared 
from view. They were almost dazed. They 
covld not possibly, in so short a time, mentally 
grasp the ideas that were conveyed, nor even 
their substance, . . . Not imtil it had been 
read and commented upon on the other side of 
the Atlantic did we place it in our own minds 
among the masterpieces."

Higher Edvcatiox ix America.* 

Concerning education in America, there are 
many conflicting voices, some finding no praise 
high enough, others crying only of its errors 
and defects. We would be the last to deny the 
possibilities of almost limitless improvement in 
our system : too often superficiality marks our 
theories, and false economy alternates with prod- 
igality in our administration ; our compulsory 
attendance is largely a farce ; our professional 
training of teachers touches only the mar gin of 
the field. Notwithstanding all this, and much 
more, the record of American education is one 
to warm the heart of every one of us, and deepen 
our just and reasonable pride in our nation and 
our history. Most of all is this true of higher 
education, in which America has distinguished 
herself in more ways than are commonly recog- 
nized. 

President Thwing's " History of Higher Edu- 
cation in America" is animated and rightly 
influenced by a sense of the greatness of the 
theme, and wOl be welcomed by an unusually 
large and varied body of readers The book 
has a very distinct character of its own : first, 
it does not contain an iminteresting page ; the 
reader who takes it up is likely to read from 
page to page and from chapter to chapter until 
he reaches the end. The author has ransacked 
the sources, and has shown uncommon discern- 
ment in what he has brought away for his 
readers ; we imagine that few will read it with- 
out frequently meeting what is new to them, or 
even surprising ; most of us have some vague 
idea that lotteries were far commoner once than 
they are now, but how many are aware that 
'* Down to the beginning of the fourth decade 
f of the eighteenth century] nearly all colleges 
were enriched through lotteries"? (p. 328). 
The elective system, usually thought so recent 
an arrangement, we find was in force, at least 
in the College of William and Mary, in the time 
of the Revolutionary War (p. 62). Not a little 
of the interest of the work is due to the constant 
use of concrete description ; the actual life of 
the student is portrayed in many cases by the 
aid of quotations from diaries, letters, and other 
first-hand records. 

The history is personal and biographical to 
a great degree, — indeed, we think to a fault ; 
the constant prominence of the figures of indi- 
vidual teachers, administrators, students, grad- 
uates, founders, and friends, robs the larger

aspects of the theme of their due space and at- 
tention. But it cannot be denied that the per- 
sonal quality enhances the interest, for not only 
is it true that the proper study of mankind is 
man, but it is also a fact that most of vis like to 
see the individual in propria persona, and not 
veiled under a colorless general term. So the 
book abounds in men, great teachers like Silli- 
man and Agassiz, administrators like Josiah 
Quincy and Eliphalet Nott ; and many brilliant 
names from outside the field of education, such 
as those of Jefferson, John Adams, Franklin, 
and Webster. Here is perhaps the place to 
express our surprise that nowhere in the book 
have we been able to find any mention of one 
of the largest figures of the latest period of 
higher education in America, William Rainey 
Harper ; it is hard to see how such a history can 
be thought complete without mention of this 
man and his work. 

Dr. Thwing does not content himself with 
any external account of educational affairs and 
institutions, but seeks everywhere for their mo- 
tive and spirit. The many human figures that 
enliven the narrative are there because they 
embody the ideals, the aspirations, the enthusi- 
asms, which were the true creative forces pro- 
ducing the outward and visible forms of educa- 
tional institutions. Religious and moral purpose, 
devotion to higher thought and to pure science, 
the spiritual influence of France and Germany 
at different epochs, receive full recognition 
among the formative principles of our institu- 
tions of learning. This quality of our author 
finds its best expression in the closing chapter 
on the general results of higher education in 
America ; here he sets forth with insight and 
warmth what he regards as the services which 
higher learning has rendered to the common- 
wealth, intellectually, religiously, socially, polit- 
ically. One would be cold or skeptical indeed 
who could read this chapter without a glow of 
sympathetic enthusiasm. 

We have already spoken of the author's skill 
in the selection of materials ; this quality, per- 
haps the very first essential for good composi- 
tion of any sort, springs from a certain natural 
sympathy and comprehension which enable the 
possessor to choose from a mass of details those 
which men will love to hear. Dr. Thwing's 
power in this respect shows itself particularly 
in felicitous quotation, and is perhaps at its best 
in the fine chapter on " The Colleges in the Civil 
War." There are sentences or paragraphs from 
letters written by students and teachers of both 
Northern and Southern colleges ; each has its 



own message, and together they convey a vivid 
and touching picture of what the outbreak of 
the war meant to these men engaged in the 
peaceful pursuit of knowledge. No citation 
which we can make here can fairly represent 
the chapter, but we select one or two striking 
and descriptive passages. These are from stu- 
dents' letters : "It was impossible for me to 
carry on my studies with any degree of interest 
or of profit to myself. ... I felt that if I re- 
mained at college, I could derive no benefit 
whatever while my mind was so entirely inter- 
ested in another direction." " It is not congenial 
• to my tastes to go to war, but it seems now that 
all who love their country ought to be willing 
to take up arms in its defense." The chapter 
fitly closes with the well-known lines composed 
and spoken by a college professor to college 
students : 

" What were our lives without thee ? 

What all our lives to save thee ? 

We reck not what we gave thee ; 

We will not dare to doubt thee, 

But ask whatever else, and we will dare." 

As the author says (p. 374), "The lesson . . , 
is the general lesson of the patriotism of the 
American college. . . . There is no antago- 
nism between culture and patriotism. . . . The 
American college is the nursery of patriotism.'^ 
It is of course impossible to do justice to the 
history of higher education in America within 
the limits of five hundred pages ; there is, then, 
the more need for keeping true proportion, and 
above all not omitting any essential elements. 
Dr. Thwing's book seems to us to be defective 
in this regard. The most conspicuous cases of 
this defect are found in the neglect of several 
distinctively American characteristics. First 
among these we would name the American 
college as an institution markedly different in 
organization and function from any foreign 
type. We cannot feel that this great fact in 
our history receives adequate recognition in the 
book. It is possible that all the actual material 
for such recognition is included, much of it, for 
instance, in Chapter XVII., on "Undergraduate 
Affairs and Undertakings," but the material is 
nowhere concentrated upon the significant point. 
Again, the whole subject of technical education 
is slighted, in spite of the fact that America 
has actually created an institution and a method 
for such education, and in consequence has been 
able to send her men and her machinery to 
all parts of the world in successful competi- 
tion with the output of older nations (and we 
may add that calling this a characteristic achieve- 
ment of America by no means implies the opinion 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



323 



that it is one of her greatest or best achieve- 
ments). Thirdly, the State university ^ now 
looming so large upon the future of higher edu- 
cation, and indubitably a natural outcome of 
our educational and social history, is almost 
ignored in Dr. Thwing's account. Naturally, 
the experiment station and the agricultural col- 
lege share the same neglect. 

Besides these cases of the neglect of pecul- 
iarly American elements we note that insufficient 
attention is given to the rise of American sci- 
entific and professional literature ; our scholars 
and scientists have done their best, in the face 
of some adverse conditions, to contribute to the 
store of hmnan knowledge, and not a few jour- 
nals of the many established have attained in- 
ternational reputation. Finally, is not German 
influence even more deserving of a separate 
chapter than French? 

^Vhen we turn to the style of the book, we 
are met by astonishing inequality. Some of the 
chapters are clear, strong, often fluent, and at 
times almost grand ; such, for example, is the 
treatment of Jefferson and the University of 
Virginia in Chapter VII. Some of the earlier 
chapters, on the other hand, are marred by 
petty imperfections, and by the prevalence of a 
disjointed, almost jerky, structure. Examples 
of this last faidt would take too much space ; 
specimens occur on page 19 (last seven lines), 
page 68 (last paragraph), page 89 (first nine 
lines). To illustrate the numerous small flaws 
referred to, we give the following : " A little of 
history, and a little of botany " (p. 29). " The 
college was placed at Cambridge, first called 
Newtown, in recognition of the English origin 
of the foimdation " (p. 9). " Gowns, silver 
pots, . . . and the services of a barber are ele- 
ments quite as significant as in some instances 
more costly than the room and tuition " (p. 41). 
One need not be a purist to object to the repeated 
use of share ioT part (pp. 19, 26, etc.), obtained 
ioT prevailed or existed (pp. 27, 29, etc.), and 
represent in such phrases as " boxing matches, 
dancing . . . represented severe [«ic.^] offenses" 
(p. 34 ^/i). These petty faults of style and 
diction, even though they rarely destroy the 
sense, do annoy the reader and distract his at- 
tention. Surely no reputable writer can afford 
to let his work get into public print unpiirged 
of such blemishes. 

Some other minor criticisms might be made : 
definite information is often omitted, or con- 
cealed in a mass of detail, particularly in the 
case of the dates of opening of the early colleges 
(see pages 54f, 67f, 11 If). The name Catho- 



lepistemiad is hardly to be called " mongrel," 
odd as it is ; nor does the context make clear 
just how it is "significant" (p. 202). More 
seriously wrong seems the statement that " the 
method and purpose of the French nation [at the 
end of the XVIII. century] were one with the 
method, purpose, and power of the new Ameri- 
can nation " (p. 193). Nor do we think it true 
that the degree of Ph.D., in America at least, 
" has come to represent what the degree of 
Bachelor stood for in the continental universities 
six hundred years ago " (p. 429). This would 
be nearer the truth if asserted of Germany, 
where the Ph.D. is considered the minimiim 
qualification for giving any higher instruction ; 
but even there the resemblance is slight, for 
the Bachelor of the fourteenth century, like the 
Bachelor of to-day, after taking his baccalau- 
reate degree, resumes his attendance at the lec- 
tures of the regular university masters or 
professors. (See Rashdall, "Universities of 
Europe," I., pp. 443-448.) 

But these defects are of secondary importance, 
to be regretted in a dignified work, yet not 
seriously impairing its value. The book is con- 
ceived and executed in a large and generous 
spirit, combines accuracy and interest in an 
unusual degree, and is a notable addition to the 
literature of our educational history.

A Critic Militaxt.* 



There are critics and critics. There is the 
critic who is chiefly concerned with matters of 
style and technique, who views literature as a 
thing apart, and pronovmces Rhadamanthine 
judgments upon poems and novels and plays. 
Then there is the critic who is preoccupied with 
categories and classifications, who is an exponent 
of what he calls the philosophy of literature, 
and whose mission it is to develop abstract prin- 
ciples out of concrete materials. And then there 
is the critic who finds literature to be primarily 
the criticism and the expression of human life, 
and is all the time bent upon pointing out its 
relations to the political and social and intel- 
lectual environment of the men who are its 
producers. To this class of critics Dr. Georg 
Brandes clearly belongs ; and if we add that he 
puts into his work an aggressive or militant 
element, that energy means more to him than 
art (although art is by no means left out of the

question ) , and that his aim is quite as much the 
propagation of ideas as the evaluation of pro- 
ducts, we have a reasonably accurate formula of 
his activity. He is one of the foremost of living 
critics by virtue of his immense knowledge of 
literature and the devotion which he has applied 
to its interpretation for something like forty 
years. The importance of his work has won its 
deserved but long-delayed recognition through- 
out the European world, and particularly, since 
the publication of his Shakespearean studies, 
the English-speaking public has learned to know 
and value his critical product. 

Under these circumstances, then, it is safe to 
say that his volume of " Reminiscences " will 
find many eager readers in both England and 
the United States. No one who has felt the 
influence of his work can fail to be attracted by 
his own account — his own frank and intimate 
revelation — of the unfolding of his intellectual 
life, and the shaping of the ideas about modern 
literature that he has enforced with so much 
impressiveness in so many books. The vigor 
and the vitality which characterize his treatment 
of other writers are equally characteristic of this 
account of his own career, and impart even to 
the most trivial happenings a high degree of 
interest. Nor is interest of a more objective sort 
lacking. Although this instalment of what we 
hope is to be a complete autobiography takes us 
only to the early seventies, when the writer has 
just turned thirty, its scope embraces the spo- 
liation of Denmark by Germany (a chapter of 
history which was the occasion of much soul- 
searching for Scandinavian youth) and the later 
spoliation of France by Germany after the ex- 
citing months of the War and the Commune. 
These happenings, and the contemporary hap- 
penings in Italy, all figure in these reminiscent 
pages, and gain fresh interest from their reflec- 
tion in the consciousness of this independent 
observer. We have also glimpses of famous 
men — Taine, Renan, Mill — with whose friend- 
ship the youthful critic was honored, and to 
whom he has elsewhere paid more formal 
tributes. 

Of Scandinavian personalities there is of 
course much mention. Aside from Ibsen and 
Bjomson, the men introduced to us are little 
more than names to the general reader, whose 
knowledge of Scandinavian literature, if not an 
absolutely minus quantity, is at best apt to be 
haphazard or accidental. Before the two great 
men just named appeared above the horizon, 
our public thought of Scandinavian literature 
as chiefly represented by Swedenborg, Hans 



Christian Andersen, and the estimable Frederika 
Bremer. Tliis is very much as if an intelligent 
foreigner should have thought of English liter- 
ature as mainly adorned by Cudworth, Harriet 
Martineau, and " Lewis Carroll." Now many 
of the names mentioned by Dr. Brandes are 
doubtless of no more than parochial interest, 
but there are many others of which no cultivated 
person can afford to be ignorant. Such writers 
as Holberg, Oehlenschliiger, Kierkegaard, and 
Drachmann — to mention Danes alone — count 
for a good deal in the history of literature ; and 
we have always been thankful to our author for 
the calm assurance with which he has named 
them in his books whenever their example would 
serve his purpose, as if taking for granted that 
they would be no less familiar than examples of 
similar weight drawn from other literatures. 
" If you have never heard of them, so much the 
worse for you " is the unspoken "aside" which 
accompanies many references in " Main Cur- 
rents " and the other works. 

But if we are to convey any idea of the 
quality of these " Reminiscences," we must cut 
short our preliminary observations, and busy 
ourselves with extracts. The story begins at 
the beginning. 

" He was little, and looked at the world from below. 
All that happened went on over his head. Everyone 
looked down to him. . . . The trying moment of the 
day was when he had to go to bed. His parents were 
extraordinarily prejudiced about bed-time, just when 
he was enjoying himself most." 

He was a delicate boy physically, but his eager 
little mind was woi'king at an early age, and 
serious problems perplexed his tender years. 

" God was strange, too, in other ways ; He was present 
everywhere, and yet mother was cross and angry if you 
asked whether he was in the new moderator lamp, which 
burnt in the drawing-room Avith a much brighter light 
than the two wax candles used to give. God knew 
everything, which was very uncomfortable, since it was 
impossible to hide the least thing from Him. Strangest 
of all was it when one reflected that, if one knew what 
God thought one was going to say, one could say some- 
thing else and His omniscience would be foiled. But 
of course one did not know what He thought would come 
next." 

The child who thus reasoned about " fate, free- 
will, foreknowledge absolute " was the father of 
the man in a more than usually accurate sense. 
One childish experience made a great impression. 
He noticed that for some time, when out walk- 
ing with his nursemaid, boys in the street had 
been making faces at him and calling him names. 
" One day when I had heard the shout again, I made 
up my mind that I would know, and when I came home 
asked my mother: » Wliat does it mean?' 'Jew!' said 
mother, ' Jews are people.' ' Nasty people? ' ' Yes,' said 



1906.] 



THE DIAL 



325 



mother, smiling, ' sometimes very ugly people, but not 
always.' ' Could I see a Jew? ' ' Yes, very easily,' said 
mother, lifting me up quickly in front of the larg^ oval 
mirror above the sofa. I uttered a shriek, so that mother 
hurriedly put me down again, and my horror was such 
that she regretted not having prepared me. Later on 
she occasionally spoke about it." 

Thus early in life was learned the lesson of 
race-prejudice, so wide-spread, so dishonoring 
to human nature, and so terrible in its occa- 
sional consequences. 

Although of the Jewish race, the boy's family 
was anything but orthodox. 

" Nothing was ever said at home about any religious 
creed. Neither of my parents was in any way asso- 
ciated with the Jewish religion, and neither of them 
ever went to the Synagogue." 

Nevertheless, the boy was in due time con- 
firmed, according to law and custom; but his 
rationalizing instincts had already asserted 
themselves, and he looked upon the ceremony 
with something like disdain. 

"The confirmation, according to my mocking sum- 
marj' of the impression produced by it, consisted mainly 
in the hiring of a tall silk hat from the hat-maker, and 
the sending of it back next day, sanctified. The siUy 
custom was at that time prevalent for boys to wear silk 
hats for the occasion, idiotic though they made them 
look. . . . "When called upon to make my confession of 
faith with the others, I certainly joined my first ' yes,' 
this touching a belief in Grt)d, to theirs, but remained 
silent at the question as to whether I believed that God 
had revealed Himself to Moses and spoken by His 
prophets. I did not believe it. I was, for that matter, 
in a wavering frame of mind imable to arrive at any 
clear understanding. . . . Under these circumstances, 
my young soul, feeling the need of something it coidd 
worship, fled from Asia's to Europe's Divinities, from 
Palestine to Hellas, and clung with vivid enthusiasm to 
the Greek world of beauty and the legends of its Gods. 
From all the learned education I had, I only extracted 
this one thing: an enthusiasm for ancient Hellas and 
her Gods; they were my Gods, as they had been those 
of Jidian. ApoUo and Artemis, Athene and Eros and 
Aphrodite grew to be powers that I believed in and 
rejoiced over in a very different sense from any Grod re- 
vealed on Sinai, or in Emmaus. They were near to me." 

So he goes on to relate that Thorwaldsen's 
Museum in Copenhagen became the temple in 
which he worshipped, and that he found his 
" soul's true native land " through the revela- 
tions of the great Danish sculptor. 

The youth whose attitude toward religion was 
thus early defined, and in a sense so antagonistic 
to conventional beliefs, was naturally destined 
to a somewhat imcomfortable career. The odium 
theologicum is the meanest and the most ma- 
lignant of all the foes of intellectual freedom, 
and a large part of Dr. Brandes's life has been 
spent in defending himself from its attacks. 
The clergy paid their compliments to the young 



man from his first appearance in the intellectual 
arena. The following incident is illuminating : 

" One day in 1868 the much-respected Pastor Hoh- 
lenberg walked into my friend Benny Spang's house, 
reprimanded her severely for recei\'ing such an un- 
doubted heretic and heathen under her roof, and de- 
manded that she should break off all association with 
me. As she refused to do so and turned a deaf ear to 
his arguments, losing all self-control, he flung his felt 
hat on the floor, continued to rage and rail against me, 
and, no result coming of it, dashed at last, in a towering 
passion, out through the door, which he slammed be- 
hind him. There was a farcical ending to the scene, 
since he was obliged to ring at the door again for his 
hat, which, in his exasperation, he had forgotten." 

It is no wonder that such provocations as these 
developed the aggressive side of the student's 
personality, and made him a critic militant, a 
critic of many other matters than those of purely 
literary interest. Referring to the above inci- 
dent, he says : 

" This was a kind of private prologue to the ecclesi- 
astical drama which from the year 1871 upwards was 
enacted in most of the pulpits of the country. Only the 
parsons, instead of flinging their hats upon the floor, 
beat their hands against the pulpit." 

The young man's vocation was early declared. 
" I felt an inward conviction that I should make 
my way as a writer," he says, speaking of his 
feelings at the age of eighteen, when he had 
just passed his philosophical examination. " It 
seemed to me that a deathlike stillness reigned 
for the time being over European literature, but 
that there were mighty forces working in the 
silence." That same year he wrote in his diary 
as follows : 

" We Danes, with our national culture and our knowl- 
edge of the literatures of other countries, will stand 
well equipped when the literary horn of the Gods re- 
sounds again through the world, calling fiery youth to 
battle. I am firmly convinced that that time will come 
and that I shall be, if not the one who evokes it in the 
North, at any rate one who will contribute greatly 
toward it." 

To prepare himself for the fray, he studied lit- 
erature, art, sesthetics, philosophy, political 
science, even jurisprudence and music. He must 
have had an enormous power of assimilation in 
those early years, for the ground that he cov- 
ered was simply amazing. Here is to be found 
the fundamental explanation of his later influ- 
ence as a critic. It is not merely because he 
has always related literature to life that he ap- 
peals to us so forcibly, but it is also because 
his wTitings, whatever their theme, always re- 
flect a wide range of thought and observation, 
always reveal a mind that has subjected itseK 
to severe and various disciplines in its formative 
period.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Dr. Brandes was fortunate enough in his early 
manhood to attract the attention and gain the 
confidence of three of the leaders of European 
thought, Taine, Renan, and Mill. Of the three. 
Mill was the one who most deeply impressed 
and influenced him, and his characterization of 
the English philosopher is of much interest. It 
was in the summer of 1870, only a few days 
before the declaration of war, that the two men 
first met. 

" At that time Mill was without any doubt among 
Europe's most distinguished men, the greatest admirer 
of French history and French intellectual life to be found 
outside of France ; but he was of quite a different type 
from the French, even from those I esteemed most 
highly. The latter were comprehensive-minded men, 
bold and weighty like Taine, or cold and agile like 
Renan, but they were men of intellect and thought, 
only having no connection with the practical side of 
life. They were not adapted to personal action, felt no 
inclination to direct interference. Mill was different. 
Although he was more of a thinker than any of them, 
his boldness was not of the merely theoretical kind. 
He wished to interfere and re-model. . . . Thus in him 
I met, for the first time in my life, a figure who was 
the incarnation of the ideal I had drawn for myself of 
the great man. This ideal had two sides: talent and 
character; great capacities and inflexibility. The men 
of great reputation whom I had met hitherto, artists 
and scientists, were certainly naen richly endowed with 
talents; but I had never hitherto encountered a per- 
sonality combining talents with gifts of character. . . . 
Now I had met a grand inflexibility of ideas in human 
form, and was impressed for my whole life long. . . . 
In MiU I learnt at last to know a man in whom the 
power of action, disturbance, and accomplishment were 
devoted to the service of modern sociological thought." 

A few days after this first interview, the author 
made a visit to England, and enjoyed frequent 
conversations with his new friend, conversations 
which " had a fertilising and helpful influence " 
upon all the rest of his life. 

The following glimpse of Louis Napoleon in 
1870 is interesting : 

" The Emperor himself was a wreck. I had had no 
doubt of that since I had one day seen him at very close 
quarters in the Louvre, where he was inspecting some 
recently-hung decorative paintings. It was quite evi- 
dent that he could not walk alone, but advanced, half- 
sliding, supported by two tall chamberlains, who each 
gave him an arm. His eyes were half-closed and his 
gaze absolutely dulled. The dressed and waxed mous- 
tache, which ran to a needle-like pomt, looked doubly 
tasteless against his wax mask of a face. He was the 
incarnation of walking decrepitude, vapid and slack." 

How utterly this arch-criminal had become re- 
duced to the condition of a mere simidacrum of 
a man appears from what is written of him a 
few weeks later, after the early disasters of the 
war. Despised by all parties alike, his name 
was already half -consigned to oblivion. 

" He himself hardly dared to send any messages. 



After having been obliged to surrender the supreme 
command, he followed the army, like a mock emperor, 
a kmd of onlooker, a superfluous piece on the board. . . . 
The Revolution of September 4th was not an overturn- 
ing of tilings ; it was merely the ratification of a state of 
affairs that people were already agreed upon in the cap- 
itol, and had been even before the battle of Gravelotte." 

With these few extracts from this extraor- 
dinarily interesting volume our review must 
close. Many aspects of the work have not been 
touched upon at all, and little has been said of 
its character as an intimate and charming per- 
sonal revelation. The writer declares that one 
of the deepest impressions of his early life came 
from his reading of Goethe's " Dichtung und 
Wahrheit," and this we may well believe, for he 
has himself produced an autobiography of the 
same type and having the same sort of attract- 
iveness. The story, as now told, leaves the au- 
thor in Italy, at the age of thirty, and on the 
eve of his return to Denmark. We trust that 
he plans to continue the narrative ; his failure 
to do so would be nothing less than a literary 
calamity. William Morton Payne.

were the forces and what the combinations that pro- 
duced the "youngest child of the world's old age"? 
The historian of both events and tendencies, who 
inquires into the inner workings of mind as well as 
of things outward, would wish to know what prepar- 
atory thinking was done by the Japanese themselves. 
At what were their men of vision and foresight 
active a century or two before Townsend Harris ? 
The writer who looks at the problem from the 
European side will tell you much about British and 
other naval operations. Probably the American 
missionaries who, as early as 1859, began to train 
the modern intellect of Japan and to make it a seed- 
bed for thought brought from the West, could tell 
most of all. Yet not the least important side is that 
seen from the view-point of the foreign servant of 
the Japanese government, who a generation ago 
taught material civilization and matters of engineer- 
ing interest to eager pupils in Japan. Such an author, 
competent and clear-headed, although not a past- 
master in literary composition, is Mr. J. Morris, who 
spent some years of his early manhood in helping 
the Japanese to learn the arts and sciences by which 
they afterwards were able to humble Russia. In the 
twenty-two biographies, each accompanied by a full- 
page reproduction of a photographic portrait, that 
compose his volume entitled "The Makers of Japan" 
(McClurg), he sets out to show who these makers

really were. He tells us of Keiki, the still-living 
last of the shoguns, and of the three men who, seeing 
the American treaty ships coming when these were 
yet below the horizon, wanted their country to wel- 
come them, but who, in the sixties, met what may 
be called the death of martyrs. Then he pictures 
the two bright lads who, exchanging the incendiary's 
torch and the assassin's sword for the ways of peace 
and law, stole away to Europe and came back to be 
the unquailing champions of civilization, now known 
as the Marquis Ito and Count Inouye. The two 
Kioto court nobles who formed the link between the 
throne and the people, Iwakura and Sanjo, are next 
set before us. After that follow the great statesmen, 
soldiers, and creators of New Japan, each with a 
chapter. If Mr. Morris had the literary skill, he 
would have made a book of value and interest far 
beyond the writings of Lafcadio Hearn, who is 
popxilarly supposed to be '' an inspired exponent of 
Japanese esoterics," but who has built not a few 
theorems out of materials supplied by his own en- 
thusiastic admiration. Basing his narrative on facts, 
Mr. Morris has made a book probably as readable 
as his novel of 1895. " What WHl Japan Do? " He 
has furnished a handbook of biographical informa- 
tion immensely superior to Mr. Lanman's "Leading 
Men of Japan." A good index furnishes the key to 
open the treasures here presented with a richness 
that reminds one of Ali Baba's cave. It is just the 
book needed, and often called for in vain, at many 
libraries. 

" Windinrj and ^^ " ^he Connecticut River and 
willow-fringed the Valley of the Connecticut " (Put- 
Connecticut." ^am), the author, Mr. Edwin Mun- 
roe Bacon, has brought together about the " Beautiful 
River " and its immediate neighborhood the stories 
and history of the settlers and settlements of that 
region, whether in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ver- 
mont, or New Hampshire. He dwells in consider- 
able detail upon many points that general histories 
of the United States mention but casually, whUe at 
the same time he has drawn from local histories 
only those facts (or legends) that contribute to the 
unity of the treatment. That he has relied upon his 
predecessors in the field (though none had hitherto 
chosen his precise localization) more than upon 
original sources, seems probable, inasmuch as he is 
much given to quoting felicitous phrases without 
credit to the authors. The historical section of the 
book begins with the year 1614, when Adria«n 
Block, '• first of Eui'opean navigators to enter and 
explore " the Connecticut River, laid the foundation 
for the struggle between the Dutch and English 
along its lower banks — a struggle that finally re- 
sulted in the English supremacy, through the instru- 
mentality of those rebels against the Massachusetts 
Bay leaders who sought and finally obtained per- 
mission to establish themselves apart. The history 
of the valley, as its settlements extended slowly up 
the river, is followed to the end of the eighteenth 
century, after which time the history of the valley 



towns gradually became absorbed into that of their 
respective states. Among the prominent episodes 
included in this section are the separation of the 
Rev. Thomas Hooker and his followers from the 
Bay government, the beginnings of Yale College, 
the battle of Bloody Brook, the Sack of Deerfield, 
the wai" of the " New Hampshire Grants," and the 
establishment of Dartmouth College.' The second 
part, " Romances of Navigation," treats of the river 
as an early colonial highway, traces the establish- 
ment upon it of various locks and canals, tells of the 
efforts to carry steamboating up the river and of its 
final disappearance at the coming of the raUroads. 
The third section, on the " Topography of River 
and Valley," takes the reader from source to mouth, 
describing special points of formation and scenery, 
and pointing out historic spots and buildings on the 
banks and in the bordering towns. For those who 
have once visited these lovely scenes, as well as for 
the intending traveller, this section is naturally the 
most interesting, although the entire book may be 
read with pleasure and enlightenment, in spite of its 
faults. Numerous instances could be adduced of 
careless writing (sometimes no doubt of careless 
proof-reading) — such as the indiscriminate use of 
the words " Mahican " and " Mohegan," Maria 
Smith for Sophia Smith (the founder of Smith Col- 
lege), " goal " for " g^l," etc. There is a fairly 
good index, but Mr. Bacon would not have erred in 
providing a list of authorities or an occasional foot- 
note of reference. A word should be said concern- 
ing the numerous illustrations, which are attractive 
and well-executed photographs, but to our thinking 
do not include a sufficient number possessing his- 
toric interest or significance. 



Librariei

With his wonted clearness and f orce,^ 
and in English that it is a delight to 
read, Mr. J. N. Earned, well known 
as former librarian of the Buffalo Public Library 
and as the editor of a very useful encyclopaedia of 
history, emphasizes the urgent necessity of spread- 
ing the culture of good literature among the people 
at large. His little volume on " Books, Culture, and 
Character " (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.) is made up 
of seven addresses, or parts of addresses, delivered at 
various times between 1883 and the present year. 
In his opinion, the impoi-tance of libraries and the 
benefits accruing from the study of history are be- 
yond estimate. His enthusiasm renders almost im- 
practicable for most readers his advice on historical 
reading. In American history alone he names, as 
if in passing and as a mere preliminary to larger 
undertakings, books to be read that aggregate per- 
haps twenty thousand pages. In biography, he 
makes somewhat light of Boswell's hero, but he says 
a good thing about biographical reading in general. 
" I have never known one person," he declares, 
" who enjoyed what may be called the fine flavors 
of character in biography who had not fine tastes 
in all literature." In his abomination of sensfttional

journalism he ventures to affirm, " I would prefer 
absolute illiteracy for a son or daughter of mine, 
total inability to spell a printed word, rather than 
that he or she should be habitually a reader of the 
common newspapers of America, and a reader of 
nothing better." One more quotation may fittingly 
close this brief notice of an excellent book. " I am 
by nature an optimist. Things as they are in the 
world look extremely disheartening to me ; but I 
think I can see forces at work which will powerfully 
change them before many generations have passed. 
Among such forces, the most potent in my expecta- 
tion is that which acts from the free public library. 
Through its agency, in my belief, there will come a 
day — it may be a distant day, but it will come — 
when the large knowledge, the wise thinking, the 
fine feeling, the amplitude of spirit that are in the 
great literatures, will have passed into so many 
minds that they will rule society democratically, by 
right of numbers." 

Trifles of airy lightness, and having 
ZTntV^J-oom. alsosomethingof etherialgrace, make 

up Mr. George KnoUys's " Ledgers 
and Literature" (John Lane Co.). The character 
of these essays is well indicated by their having 
already appeared, in part at least, in a private magar 
zine entitled " Sense and Nonsense." The first paper 
is on " The Romance of Book-keeping " — surely 
a contradiction in terms, one would say. But read 
it and see. The very balance-sheet " is almost hu- 
man in a sense, and so does it get hold of our psy- 
chology that even now we feel that anything said 
against it might be to our detriment. For nothing 
in life, not even a half-developed young woman, is 
so freighted with contradictions as this document." 
Other chapters treat, with much delicate sentiment 
and a most engaging playfulness, of dining, of 
lunching in the city, on the advantages of living in 
a lunatic asylum, on the cultivation of the spirit of 
Greek archaeology, and several other matters. Some 
of these humorously fanciful sketches might almost 
have come from the pen of Charles Lamb at his 
desk in the East India House ; and one notes with 
approval the author's expressed admiration of Elia. 
With almost equal sq,tisfaction we greet his tribute

Civil War. g^^ Louis), Mr. Denton J. Snider has 
attempted a philosophical interpretation of the 
causes, conditions, and results of the American Civil 
War. For this task he certainly has some qualifica- 
tions, particularly on the philosophical side, since we 
are told that he has already exhibited his views in 
twenty-six published volumes, of which nine were 
on Shakespeare, Goethe, Homer, and Dante, six 
on philosophy, three on kindergarten subjects, three 
on miscellaneous matters, and five were of poetry 
covering the field from " Agamemnon's Daughter " 
to "Johnny Appleseed's Rhymes." Now with his 
twenty -seventh volume Mr. Snider enters the his- 
torical field. It must be said that he follows no old 
paths, but breaks a road for himself. He begins 
with the Kansas troubles in 1855, and traces sec- 
tional controversies down to the surrender of Lee. 
He uses much philosophical jargon, has much to 
say about Folk Soul, World Spirit, Spirit of the 
Age, Conscience, etc., all of which, and much else, 
he writes with capital letters. Everywhere is evi- 
dence of wide acquaintance with the classics, but 
one searches in vain for signs of superior historical 
knowledge. Clearly he knows much more about the 
Peloponnesian War than he does about the American 
Civil War. The entire philosophical structure is 
based on a weak foundation of facts. However, 
valueless as much of this work is, there are here 
and there some keen observations, evidently based on 
personal experience, in regard to conditions in the 
West before the Civil War, especially with reference 
to the Western attitude toward slavery and negroes, 
to the Western leaders, and the Kansas emigrants. 
Some suggestive points are brought out relative to 
the influence of abstract ideas in the sectional con- 
troversy and to the immense power of the public 
press.

now busy with the new economy of making the 
various members of her family understand each 
other. Japan, after a thousand years of intellectual 
life, has produced very little in the field of pure 
philosophy which is likely to win the respect of the 
world. Her ancients and classics are in India and 
China ; her genius is in their selection and assimi- 
lation. Dr. George William Knox, in his scholarly 
philosophical work on "The Spirit of the Orient" 
(Crowell), gives four chapters to the discussion of 
what the Japanese call the " treasure lands " — India 
and China, and two to " the great borrowing nation," 
Nippon. In a final essay upon the New World, in 
which he interprets the significance of the victory 
of Japan, he sees no "yellow peril" or any likeli- 
hood of Japan wanting to make more war. He 
knows that the Japanese are a very young people, 
and sees in them an unconquerable determination to 
be both scientific and free. He cannot discern that

the Chinese are ever likely to conquer anybody, or 
that they even have the desire to do so. He sums 
up his thinking by showing us how we can teach 
the East by showing them the value of personality. 
As action and reaction are equal, he predicts that 
the old Asiatics are yet to lead us away from our 
absorption in the things of sense, and to introduce 
new elements into our life and thought. The su- 
preme conflict of the coming centuries, — rather, 
we may say, the progress that will result in recon- 
ciliation and unity, — will be in finding the balance 
between East and West. In the Orient, the politi- 
cal organism is supreme ; in the Occident it is the 
individual. From the union of East and West shall 
come forth the higher and better humanity, and the 
new world in which peace and truth abide. 

The recreations P^of essor Simon Newcomb is gener- 
0/ o veteran ally conceded to be one of the f ore- 

attronomer. most astronomers of the world, and 

thus one of its leading men of science. His intel- 
lectual interests cover a wide range, and now in the 
ripeness of years he writes much and admirably upon 
a variety of topics. His latest work, " Sidelights 
on Astronomy" (Harper) consists of a collection 
of twenty-one essays and addresses most of which 
origfinally appeared in the pages of popular maga- 
zines, and are now revised for appearance in this 
more permanent form. Two-thirds of them are on 
astronomical themes, and several of these touch upon 
the great problem of the structure and extent of 
the universe of stars by which we are surrounded. 
Among the non-astronomical chapters are those 
entitled " The Fairyland of Geometry," " Can We 
:Make It Rain?" and "The Outlook for the Flying- 
Machine." It goes without saying that Professor 
Newcomb treats all these subjects in an Uluminating 
way. His " geometrical fairyland " is space of f our 
dimensions, in which a football might be turned in- 
side out without tearing it ; a man turning a somer- 
sault in such space would find every part of his body 
exchanged — right for left, and vice versa, when he 
resumed his original upright position. Years of 
agpricultural prosperity have driven the rain-maker 
from the public eye, so that the author's contention 
that explosions cannot produce rain will fall upon 
listless ears. In opposition to the hopes of various 
enthusiastic experimenters that a successful flying- 
machine will at last be evolved, our author firmly 
believes that no possible combination of structural 
materials, macliinery, and forces now known, can 
render aerial navigation practicable. 



TTie ttren uous 
ezUtence of 
invalidism. 



An eloquent plea against limiting the 
bestowal of college aid to the physi- 
cally robust is foimd in Mrs. Na- 
thaniel Southgate Shaler's book, "The Masters of 
Fate " (Duffield) . Her opening paragraph refers to 
the now well-known Harvard proposal to make this 
limitation ; and then follow, grouped in chapters 
according to their ailments, numerous examples of 
great men with puny bodies, all illustrating the 



book's sub-title, " the power of the will " to combat 
physical infirmity. Curiously enough, and sadlj 
enough, while the book was in the printers* hands 
Professor Shaler, himself one of the noblest proofs 
of this will-power to hold the suffering body to its 
task, succumbed at last to an attack of pneumonia. 
To his memory his wife has added a supplementary 
chapter, the freshest and best in the book. The 
tone of the work as a whole is a little suggestive of 
the excellent Dr. SmUes's " Self-Help," being a some- 
what similar combination of biography and anecdote, 
with here and there a timely pointing of the moral. 
In classifying her illustrious invalids, the author's 
inclusion of Napoleon among the epileptics, even as 
a historically doubtful example of that malady, is 
likely to give many readers a little start of surprise. 
In the footnotes credit is given to the standard bio- 
graphies consulted. For the details of Laura Bridg- 
man's life the writer appears for some unknown 
reason not to have drawn on the latest and best bio- 
gi'aphy of her, that prepared by two of Dr. Howe's 
daughters. Mrs. Shaler's book should give chronic 
invalids renewed courage, and should help them to 
resist the disheartening downpull of bodily weakness 

and decay. 

Epueopaiian ^X ^^^ ^^^ch the Rt Rev. Henry 
bishops and Codman Potter, Bishop of New York,

est to a large number of readers. Nevertheless, 
his " Reminiscences of Bishops and Archbishops " 
(Putnam) fails to gratify the expectations created by 
its title or to fulfil the promises of its preface. One 
of the causes of disappointment is that out of the 
hundred or more Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church in this country with whom he was associated 
as Secretary of tlie House of Bishops, all of them 
more or less interesting characters, he has selected 
but ten ; and of these he presents formal biographies 
rather than personal reminiscences. Another cause 
of disappointment is that so much of the matter used 
in these ten sketches is derived from other sources 
and is not of the nature of the personal reminiscences 
of the Bishop whose name appears on the title-page 
of the book. FuUy a third of the matter comprised 
in the ten biographies is quoted. Still, the first ten 
chapters of the book are a valuable biographical con- 
tribution to the history of the American Episcopal 
Church, made all the more valuable by the accom- 
panying portraits. And the concluding chapter, 
" Recollections of Three Archbishops," compensates 
for the disappointment felt in the rest of the book.

Four volumes, the seventh to the tenth, are added 
to the handsome "Gettysburg" edition of Abraham 
Lincoln's complete works, published by the Francis D. 
Tandy Company. We have recently described this 
work, and need only indicate its progress and the special 
features of these new volumes. They include Lincoln's 
writings and telegrams during nearly the whole of the

war, from September, 1861, to February, 1865, the 
period of his greatest growth and greatest ser\'ice, 
revealing to us in his own words the breadth of his 
statesmanship and the greatness of his manliood. The 
addresses and tributes included in these voUmies are by 
Robert G. IngersoU, George Bancroft, Charles Sumner, 
and Henry Ward Beecher, and are exceedingly valuable 
as contemporary judgments on Lincoln. They contain 
also the usual fine portraits of him and those asso- 
ciated with him, and among the poems the well-known 
" Punch " poem attributed to Tom Taylor. These vol- 
iimes confirm and strengthen the good opinion of this 
edition that we have already expressed. 

A happy inspiration has added a volume of " Fifty 
Shakspere Songs " to the " Musicians Library," pub- 
lished by the Oliver Ditson Co. The contents are 
grouped as follows: Songs mentioned by Shakespeare 
in his plays. Songs possibly sung in the original per- 
formances, Settings composed since Shakespeare's time 
to the middle of the nineteenth century, and Recent 
Settings. The third group includes two by Purcell, 
three by Arne, and two of Schubert's most heavenly 
lyrics. In the fourth group we find represented a num- 
Iber of the most promising of our younger writers. The 
editor of the collection is Dr. Charles Vincent, who 
supplies an introduction and notes. The Chandos por- 
trait is given for a frontispiece. 

Mr. George P. Upton's " The Standard Operas " is 
reissued by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. in an enlarged 
and revised edition. The enlargement consists in the 
added descriptions of operas that have been produced 
of recent years, and in a generovis array of portrait illus- 
trations, representing famous singers in characteristic 
costumes. There are nearly a himdred of these por- 
traits, while among the later operas described are Mr. 
Damrosch's "Scarlet Letter," Herr Goldmark's " Merlin," 
Herr Humperdinck's " Hansel imd Gretel," Mr. Pader- 
ewski's " Manru," Herr Strauss's " Feuersnoth," and 
Tschaikowsky's " Eugen Ondgin." In its present form, 
this work is far more useful and attractive than it ever 
was before, and we predict for it a long lease of re- 
newed popularity. 

" The International Library " of works devoted to the 
movement for peace and arbitration is slowly assuming 
substantial dimensions. There are seven volumes now 
published at what is practically cost price, and no little 
good may reasonably be anticipated from their circula- 
tion. The seventh volume, just added to the list, is a 
treatise on " The Moral Damage of War," by the Rev. 
Walter Walsh, of Dundee. It is a new work in twelve 
chapters, each of which discusses some special aspect of 
the moral damage of war. Thus, the effects of war 
upon the soldier, the politician, the preacher, the mis- 
sionary, and many other types of men, are successively 
considered, a matter of treatment which results in a 
terrific indictment, for every count of which the author 
cites chapter and verse. The work is published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. for the International Union. 

The appearance, within little more than a year, of 
four volumes of selections from Mr. Swinburne's poems 
appears to be symptomatic of the growth of that gen- 
eral recognition which has hitherto been withheld from 
his work. The anthology made by Dr. Payne for the 
« Belles Lettres " series of Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., 
and published last year, is now followed by three other 
selections. The first of them, made by Dr. Arthur 
Beatty for the Messrs. Crowell, illustrates what is pro- 
verbially known as the sincerest form of flattery. In 



selection, grouping, and annotation, it follows the ex- 
ample of the " Belles Lettres " volume rather more 
closely than the ethics of this sort of book-making wiU 
justify. — The volume called "Anactoria and Other 
Lyrical Poems," published by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley, 
is a pretty booklet containing fifteen pieces only. One 
or two of the selections are unexpected, but all are 
good poetry. — Of the " Selected Lyrical Poems," pub- 
lished by Messrs. Harper & Brothers, we must say 
emphatically that the title is a misnomer. The volume 
is not a selection at all, but a complete reprint of the 
first volume of " Poems and Ballads," with thirteen 
other poems chosen in accordance with no imaginable 
principle of taste and tacked on at the end. There may 
be rhyme to this volume, but there is no reason employed 
in its construction. 



Notes. 

A fourth edition, revised and extended, of Dr. C. T. 
Stockwell's suggestive essay on "The Evolution of 
Immortality " has recently been published by the James 
H. West Co. of Boston. 

The Riverside Press Editions of " The Song of 
Roland" and "The Idylls of Theocritus" have been 
delayed from various causes, we are informed, but are 
now promised for publication early in December; so 
that book-lovers who are accustomed to choosing their 
Christmas gifts from these choice editions are not likely 
to be disappointed this year. 

The Memoirs of the late Chancellor Prince von 
Hohenlohe, which seem to have been the literary sensa- 
tion of the year in Germany, will be published in this 
country at an early date by the Macmillan Co. The 
late Chancellor is said to have revealed very frankly 
the inside history of the Kaiser's dismissal of Bismarck, 
and other secrets of German diplomatic and political 
history. 

The Life of Sir Leslie Stephen, K. C. B., by Dr. 
Frederick William Maitland, about which we recently 
had something to say, is announced among the Novem- 
ber publications of Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, who 
are the American publishers of Stephen's works. Dr. 
Maitland was a close personal friend of Sir Leslie and 
his family, and is at present Downing Professor of Law 
at Cambridge University. 

Another important bird book is aimomiced by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co., who have concluded arrangements 
with Dr. Frank H. Knowlton, President of the Biologi- 
cal Society of Washington, for a volume on " Birds of 
the World," edited by Robert Ridgway, Curator of 
Birds in the National Museum. This book will appear 
in the new " American Nature Series," recently inaugu- 
rated by Dr. C. William Beebe's " The Bird." 

The hundredth anniversai-y of the birth of Longfellow 
will occur February 27 next, and will be made the occa- 
sion of a special celebration at Cambridge, the poet's 
home. All the schools of the city will take part, and 
among the speakers at the public exercises will be Mr. 
Ho wells. President Eliot, Colonel Higguison, and Profes- 
sor Norton. In commemoration of this interesting event 
a special Longfellow medal, in bronze, will be prepared, 
of a beautifiU and appropriate design, and will be 
offered to a limited number of subscribers at the price 
of ten dollars each, which may be sent to Mr. Oscar 
F. Allen, 15 Dunster Street, Cambridge, Mass.

The authorized American edition of the first story in 
the Fogazzaro Trilogy, of which // Sanio (" The Saint ") 
was the third, will be published shortly by Messrs. G. 
P. Putnam's Sons. This book, issued in Italy under the 
title of Piccolo Mondo Antico, will be published in the 
English and American editions as " The Patriot." It 
will be followed shortly by the authorized edition of the 
second story in the Trilogy, Piccolo Mondo Modemo, 
which will probably bear the title of " The Man of the 
World." 

A limited reprint of Viscount Wolseley's sketch of 
General Lee, originally published in " MacmUlan's 
Magazine " for March, 1887, has been issued by Mr. 
George P. Humphrey of Rochester. It will be recalled 
that Wolseley met Lee in 1862, and spoke later of him 
in these strong terms : " I have met many of the great 
men of my time, but Lee alone impressed me with the 
feeling that I was in the presence of a man who was 
cast in a grander mould, and made of different and finer 
metal than all other men." 

The monumental " History of English Literature " 
in fourteen royal octaro volumes which the Cambridge 
University has recently imdertaken, will be published 
in this country by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. In 
scale and plan it will more or less resemble the " Cam- 
bridge Modem History." It will embrace the whole 
course of English literature from Beowulf to the end of 
the Victorian age. The action of foreign influences and 
the part taken by secondary writers m successive lit- 
erary movements will receive a larger share of attention 
than is possible in shorter histories, in which lesser 
writers are apt to be overshadowed by a few great 
names. Each volume will contain a sufficient bibliog- 
raphy. The history will be edited by Dr. A. W. Ward, 
Master of Peterhouse, and Mr. A. R. Waller. 

We do not often receive books bearing Khartoum as 
an imprint, and this fact alone makes somewhat note- 
worthy " The Second Report of the Wellcome Research 
Laboratories at the Gordon Memorial College." The 
volume (a quarto, with many illustrations) is edited by 
Dr. Andrew Balfour, and published by the Department 
of Education of the Sudan Government. The most im- 
portant of the papers included relate to studies of mos- 
quitoes and other insect pests. There is also an inves- 
tigation of the disease called trypanosomiasis, and a 
report from the chemical laboratory upon such varied 
subjects as the Nile waters, the nulk supply of Khartoum, 
"Gum Arabic," and the Nyam Nyam arrow poison. 
Judg^g from the rich material here offered, the 
Laboratories seem to be abundantly justifying their 
existence. 

Since the publication by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. of " The Chief American Poets," edited by Pro- 
fessor Curtis Hidden Page, the publishers have been 
planning for the preparation of a series of volumes, to 
be entitled " The Chief Poets Series," which shall con- 
tain all the best work of the principal poets and drama- 
tists of different epochs; and they now announce for 
early publication the following volumes : " The Chief 
Elizabethan Dramatists " (except Shakespeare) to the 
Close of the Theatres, edited by Professor William A. 
Neilson of Harvard University; "The Chief British 
Poets of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," 
edited by Professor Curtis Hidden Page ; " The Chief 
British Poets of the Eighteenth Century," edited by 
Professor Curtis Hidden Page. In general character- 
istics these books will resemble Professor Page's " Chief 
American Poets."

"■45 unusual a child creation as was ^Little Lord Fauntleroy.' " 

THIS book belongs to that elusive, delicate class that 
have interpreted with a rare understanding the soul of 
a romantic child. It tells of the love of a Httle boy 
for a beautiful lady w^hom he first sees reflected in a stained 
glass window in church, while he is struggling desperately 
to keep awake during a long sermon. 

" He found that the lady was sitting on a line with his view of his favorite window, 
that her gown was of a dark rose velvet, which looked like that worn by the 
window lady, and that her face fitted as nearly as possible over the one in the 

window Her sweet face, of which he could see exactly one-half, again 

covered the pictured face, and he saw now that her soft, rose velvet gown had 
ever so little of a dull gold trimming on it, and so had the border of the gown 
on the Mother in the window." 

The two come to know and love each other. The little boy visits the lady often, 
and they have long serious talks about flowers and fairies. They invent won- 
derful games, and play for hours together, and finally, to his great happiness, the 
little boy goes to live with the beautiful Stained Glass Lady.

The second volume, on "The Establishment of Territorial Sovereignty," traces the formation of modern states, their

portraits and illustrations. 8vo. 84.00 net. 

" In vehemence, originality, and daring Lawbbkce has, no doubt with some exaggeration, been likened to Byron. The recent 
publication in ' An Artist's Love Story,' of his letters to Mrs. Siddons and her daughters went some way to strengthen this likeness 
by its touch of wildness and romance. These letters, divorced from the context of his life, showed Lawrkncb in a somewhat 
unfavorable light. It is hoped that the present publication will do far more than redress the balance. 

"'Sir Thomas Liwbenck's Letter-bag' is chiefly composed of selections from the correspondences of the artist and hia 
friends which have not hitherto been published. The collection consists of letters from Peel, Scott, Wellington, Cowper, Thomas 
Campbell, Miss Farren, afterwards Countexs of Derby, Lady Caroline Lamb, William Godwin, Canova, Lord Castlereagh, the Duchesa 
of Devonshire, Haydon, Mrs. Jordan, the Kembles, Mettemich, and almost every prominent person living at the end of the XVlIIth

The object of this American Mission to the Emperor Menelik was to negotiate a commercial treaty. The Mission waa extremely 
well received, and the expedition appears to have been a complete success. The picture drawn by Mr. Skihhsb of the Abyasinians 
and their ruler is an exceedingly agreeable one ; and his notes on this land of grave faces, elaborate courtesy, classic tone, and 
Biblical civilization, its history, politics, language, literature, religion, and trade, are full of interest ; there are also some valuable 
hints on the organization and equipment of a caravan.

During the last few years Tibet, wrapped through the centuries in mystery, has been effectively " opened np " to the gaze of the 
Western world, and already the reader has at his disposal an enormous mass of information on the country and its inhabitants. 
But there is in Western Tibet a region which is still comparatively little known, which is especially sacred to the Hindu and Budd- 
hist, and in which curious myths and still more curious manners abound ; and it is of this portion of the British Borderland, its 
government, and the religion and customs of its peoples, that Mr. Shkrrino writes.

Robert Appleton Company are able to announce a publishing oflfer 
that for appropriateness to the season and power to awaken loving 
memories of the donor can never be equalled again. 

Printed and bound prominently in the first volume of The Catholic 
Encyclopedia now preparing for press, and in all future first volumes, 
will appear a Roll of the work's Original Promoters, and on this Roll 
your name — or the name of a relative or friend — may have the place, 
provided you immediately respond to this advertisement. 

This Roll of Original Promoters already includes the names of men 
and women who are internationally known and whose interest in the 
work — regardless of their creed or position in life — has made them 
proud to share the honor which the printing of their names on the 
Roll will mean in future years. 

The Catholic Encyclopedia 

Prepared under the auspices of the Catholic Church, bearing 
the household name of Appleton, 

will be the greatest and most noteworthy publication of recent years. 
Completed, it will comprise 12,000 pages (15 massive volumes), will 
be a concise, scholarly digest of the Catholic Church, its history — the 
history of its influence on civilization and the upbuilding of nations. 
No work like this has ever before been published in English, and the 
interest which will be inseparable from its pages — aside from the new 
light which will be shed on many controverted subjects — can only be 
appreciated on reflecting how vast is the influence of this great re- 
ligious body, and how that influence has extended back through 
countless epochs, interweaving with the destinies of every nation on 
earth. 

Every article will be written from the Catholic point of view, 
and each article will be secured from an eminent living authority

scholarship and authority.

stories that recent years have produced."

description of the famous historic and artistic features of the 
great show place of Paris. The general design of the book is 
uniform with " Cathedral Cities."

Prisoners 

By MARY CHOLMONDELEY 
Author of " Red Pottage," etc. 

ttT^HAT 'Prisoners' is its author's first novel since 'Red 
Pottage' is significant of a reverence of her art, which 
permits no hurried work. She and her public reap the reward 
of her restraint, for, during the six or seven years which have 
elapsed since the publication of ' Red Pottage ' she has taken 
great strides, and in ' Prisoners ' has produced a novel so finely 
conceived and executed that criticism is lost in sheer delight 
and admiration." — JS'^eiv York Times, Saturday Revieiv of

Twenty Years of The 
Republic 

By Professor HARRY THURSTON PECK,

"CX)R a great many years Professor Peck has been 
a close and keen observer of the course of 
American politics. ' ' Twenty Years of the Repub- 
lic," from the Cleveland-Blaine campaign of 1884 
to the present day, is written in the spirit of a 
man who is giving reign to a favorite hobby. It 
reveals not only to the wide and mature point of 
view of the trained scholar, but also the many 
little touches, the anecdotes, the personal pecu- 
liarities, the seemingly trivial incidents which go 
so far toward making history, but which are so 
easily and quickly forgotten. Such a history is 
very valuable, both now and in the future. It 
will charm the cursory reader, and be a book of 
importance to the student. Net, $2.50.

Survey

'PHERE are few men whose position in English 
literature is more fiercely disputed, nor in 
regrard to whom critics differ more widely than 
Charles Dickens. 

Mr. Chesterton's book on Dickens is intended 
as a general justification of that author and of 
the whole of the gigantesque English humor of 
which he was the last but not the least gigantic 
survival. He treats each of the novels in turn, 
and he devotes the latter part of his book to 
a general estimate of the influence of Dickens.

TEMPO RA! MORES! 

It is with something more than Ciceronian in- 
dignation that the morals of the London "Times" 
are now being denoimced by the ahnost unani- 
mous voice of the publishing and bookselling 
interests of the United Kingdom. For some 
months past a fierce conflict (not of words only) 
has been raging in England, aroused by the 
enterprise of " The Thunderer " in seeking to 
enlarge its circtdation by offering its subscribers 
alluring opportunities for the purchase of new 
books at reduced prices. Since not only the 
newspapers and trade journals, but the authors 
as well, have taken a hand in the controversy, 
it is given an unwonted zest, and the famous 
newspaper which has provoked it is made the 
target of bolts quite as Jovian as those of which 
it has long had the traditional monopoly. 

At our distance from the scene of action, it 
is not altogether easy to view the line of battle, 
or to appreciate the strategic moves made by the 
respective forces ; but the situation is clear 
enough in its general outline, and of enough 
interest to readers everywhere to warrant dis- 
cussion by the American outsider. The struggle, 
moreover, involves a question which has arisen 
in some form in almost every country of literary 
importance, and finds its American coimterpart 
in the efforts of our own publishers to establish 
a fixed uniform price for net publications, and 
to preserve the bookseller from the extinction 
with which he is menaced by the department 
store. In its American phase, we have repeat-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1; 



edly discussed the question in these columns, 
and trust that we have left no doubt in the 
reader's mind that our sympathies are with the 
legitimate seller of books. There is no doubt 
in our mind that this is a case in which what is 
sometimes termed an " agreement in restraint 
of trade," despite the sinister monopolistic asso- 
ciations of the expression, is necessary for the 
true interests of intellectual prosperity. 

The analogous case presented by the London 
" Times " and its assailants may be briefly stated. 
That venerable three-penny organ of conserva- 
tive opinion, seeing itself of late years greatly 
outdistanced in circulation by the penny press, 
and finding its traditional methods inadequate 
to cope with the enterprise of sensation monger- 
ing journalism conducted upon the American 
plan, has been casting about for devices where- 
by to meet the new competition. When certain 
wily Americans appeared upon the scene with a 
plan for a combination offer of the " Times " 
and the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," its pro- 
prietors seized the opportunity, launched the 
enterprise, and, by dint of an unprecedented 
campaign of advertising, gained many subscrib- 
ers and much profit. Having once doffed the 
robe of journalistic dignity, these same pub- 
lishers were ready for another scheme, which 
the same wily Yankees were prompt to supply. 
It took the form of the " Times Book Club," an 
organization whereby subscribers were to have 
the right to borrow new books, and, if they 
liked, to buy them in a practically unsoiled con- 
dition at bargain prices. This is the scheme 
which has aroused the angry passions now rife 
among English publishers and dealers, and pre- 
cipitated the new " battle of the books " which 
has become a matter of such absorbing interest. 
For a time the implications of the scheme 
were not fully apparent. The publishers began 
to receive large orders from this unexpected 
quarter, were willing to accord the "Times" a 
"most favored nation" treatment in the matter 
of terms, and even accepted, without making 
too wry a face, the condition of buying from 
the newspaper a certain amount of advertising 
— a percentage based upon the book-orders — 
which' really amounted to so much additional 
discount on the sales. But presently the face 
of the matter changed. It was discovered that 
the members of the Times' Book Club — that 
is, subscribers to the number of about eighty 
thousand — were purchasing the latest publica- 
tions within a few weeks of their issue, and at 
prices that practically ignored the question of 
profit. These subscribers, moreover, were evi- 



dently buying books for their friends also ; the 
bookshops were deserted, and the publishers 
came to realize that their sales to the " Times " 
were being made at the expense of more profit- 
able sales to other middlemen. Thereupon war 
was declared. The Zauherlehrling had turned 
on the water, and now frantically sought to turn 
it off. The proper form of incantation has not 
yet been found, but dismay lias at least given 
place to hope, and united action against the 
common enemy is doing something to restore 
confidence to the hearts of authors, publishers, 
and booksellers. 

That both publishers and booksellers are 
united m their opposition to the Times' Book 
Club is evident from the action taken by their 
official organizations. The publishers made 
the modest request that the "Times" should 
not resort to undercutting during a period of six 
months from the date of a book's appearance. 
This was flatly refused, and the possibility of 
a modus vivendi was ended. Thereupon the 
publishers withdrew their advertisements from 
the paper, and refused to sell it their books 
upon trade terms. The " Times " retorted by 
declaring a boycott on the obstinate publishers, 
and went so far as to urge its readers not to buy 
any of the publications of a specified list of 
famous houses — a list headed by the name of 
the Messrs. Macmillan. Here the matter now 
stands, with the odds decidedly against the 
" Times," as that journal practically admits. If 
it cannot buy books at trade prices, the jig is 
up, and it is now cb'iven to the desperate resort 
of an appeal to prejudice after the fashion of 
the yellowest of the American newspapers. The 
London " Times " and the New York " Journal " 
make strange bedfellows, but to this association 
they have been brought, and both of them put 
forth the same disingenuous plea against a pre- 
tended monopoly in the interest of a plan which, 
rightly considered, woidd prove it a monopoly of 
the most vicious sort. The argument that pub- 
lishers make a profit of eight hmidred per cent 
on their wares is not likely to impose upon 
many readers ; it is surprismg that the constitu- 
ency of the " Times " should include any readers 
capable of being misled by so palpable an ab- 
surdity. All that the publishers need to do at 
present is to " sit tight," and, as one of them 
expresses it, "their position is as impregnable 
as Wellington's was behind the lines of Torres 
Vedras." 

As for the authors, they are for the most part 
quick to perceive the idtimate consequences of 
such a bookselling monopoly as the "Times'*

THE DTAT.

would like to establish. It would work a greater 
injury to them than residted from the old *' cir- 
culating library" system which they succeeded 
in overthrovsing a few years ago. With fresh 
memories of one old man of the sea, they are not 
likely soon to fall into the clutches of another. 
^Ir. Kipling sees the point clearly enough, and 
states it with his wonted bluntness. 

"As for the ' Times's' claim to benefit the public by 
supplying it with cheap literature, it offers no guaran- 
tee that prices once lowered to secure control of a market 
may not be raised when that market is secure ; nor is 
the record of other trusts reassuring on this head. 

" The end seems simple enough. The author, cut off 
from his bookseller, who is his distributing agent, must 
lie absolutely at the mercy of the ' Times.' So the 
public will have exchanged the right of reading at fixed 
prices whatever they wish to read for the pri^-ilege of 
buying at whatever price the ' Times ' may appoint pre- 
cisely whatever the ' Times,' in its judgment, allows to 
reach them. 

" This arrangement may pay the ' Times,' but it seems 
to be on the way to depriving literature, the author, and 
the public of a certain amoimt of fi-eedom." 

Not only have many authors as individuals 
expressed themselves in similar terms, but the 
Societj' of Authors has also stated its position 
in a series of emphatic resolutions. The authors' 
point of view is admirably summed up by ]Mr. 
G. Herbert Thring, secretary of the Society, in 
the following language : 

" If the methods of the Club be allowed to continue, 
they will spread. Imitators wiU arise. The author will 
be no longer the partner able to demand his fair share. 
He will be at the mercy of a few large ♦ concerns ' 
which can take his books at their own price or refuse to 
take them imless he accepts it, whose sole interest is 
cheap buj-ing and quick ' scrapping,' whose interest in 
literature is limited to the question how they can best 
make the buying and selling of books a useful subsidi- 
ary means of promoting the yield of their advertise- 
ments, the popidarity of their aerated water, or the 
vogue of their toilet soap. Where lies the advantage 
to the author, either to his pride or to his pocket ? It 
would be contran,- to general opinion and experience to 
suppose that in the long nm the public would find their 
benefit in a state of things savouring far more strongly 
of monopoly than the present organizations either of 
publishers or of booksellers or of authors — a state of 
things at least threatening a despotic control of the lit- 
erary profession and of the book trade by a small group 
of persons, firms, or companies, whose methods and 
objects alike are totally alien from literature, from any 
desire to promote the production and appreciation of 
good books." 

This is a nutshell form of the argument for 
prices fixed by agreement. Books are more than 
merchandise, and the midtiplication of book- 
stores, even if it means an increased cost of 
handling, is essential to the interests of culture. 
It does not greatly matter whether there are few 
or many centres for the distribution of soap or 
shoes or sausages, but it matters much whether 



there are few or many bookstores in a great 
city, whether a small town has or has not such 
an establishment. Mr. Hall Caine notes that 
there were once some twelve hundred book-shops 
in and about London, whereas there are now 
only an eighth of that number. It would be 
extremely mifortunate should the figures of 
their census be still further reduced, no matter 
how plausible the argument for economy by 
which the reduction were defended. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The value of sympathy in uteraky criticism 
is urged anew, with an emphasis worthy of Matthew 
Arnold himself, in an able review of recent critical 
literature in the current " Edinburgh Review." In the 
course of the article, Mr. George Brandes receives some 
rather hard knocks. While the writer admits that " no 
other critic could bring more knowledge, a clearer dis- 
cernment of finer distinctions, a more discriminating 
and resolute grasp of characteristic qualities, a more 
many-sided intellectual culture to his task," he at the 
same time contends that no other critic could bring " a 
more solidly unsympathetic moral aloofness from the 
individual ideals, sentiments, and emotions of the authors 
he reviews. . . He exposes without ruth the littlenesses 
of the great. His strictures are warrantable. But dis- 
paragement of the immortals by dispraise of their 
works of inferior merit, however warrantable, is to lower 
the estate of the whole art of criticism. . . . To dem- 
onstrate the base concomitants of the soil where 
gems lie embedded, to the obscuring of the vital light- 
giving properties of those gems, is to render ill service 
to the memory of those whom death has dispensed from 
all dependence on opinion, and to mankind at large. . . . 
It is, moreover, when all is said and done, the interpre- 
tation of the stars, not of the 'unpurpled vapours,' 
which leads the worlS^ errant on the path of truth." 
All this is curiously in accord with some things that 
Mr. Brandes, in his recent autobiography, has said, and 
has quoted from others, about himself. 
• • • 

Literature of the departmevt store is the latest 
thing to emanate from Boston. The salesmen and sales- 
women of a large department store in that literary centre 
write, edit, and publish a monthly review whose pvirpose 
is to promote " cultural education " — thus distinguish- 
ing, it seems, between mere business training and that 
of a finer and more intellectual character. Schools and 
colleges have for some time offered commercial courses; 
and now we have a commercial house, or rather its 
employees, offering a course in literary training. Yet 
the business aspect of the matter is not lost sight of: 
one can sell goods all the better, it seems, for a little 
"cultural education." As the writer of the leading 
article puts it, "Application to study gives one self- 
confidence through ability to concentrate one's mind on 
whatever matter may arise, in addressing people under 
conditions where a wavering manner would lose the 
case." And further, " By reading standard literature 
we unconsciously acquire the use of good English and 
the ability to paint mind pictures, both of which are 
strong factors in impressing the superior merits of our 
business upon the public, the first being also necessary

in our dealings with manufacturers, because good En- 
glish is impressive and presents arguments and needs 
in a most effective manner." A literary magazine 
issuing from a dry-goods emporium is a striking and 
not unpleasing phenomenon in the world of letters and 

of commerce.

The seventieth birthday of two literary nota- 
bles, Mr. Henry M. Alden and Mr. T. B. Aldrich, fall- 
ing on the eleventh of November, and the presence of 
the Ponkapog poet at the Franklm Square party in 
honor of the New York editor, not only furnish a pleas- 
ing spectacle to the contemplative on-looker from afar, 
but may also serve to recall attention to the works and 
worth of these two literary veterans, both of them 
authors, and magazine editors as well. A selection 
from the poems of the "enamored architect of airy 
rhyme," entitled " A Book of Songs and Sonnets," is a 
timely and welcome issue from the Riverside Press. 
We hear of no re-issue of " God in His World " and 
" A Study of Death," by Mr. Alden, but these too will 
bear re-reading. It is many days now since Mr. Aldrich 
was editor of " The Atlantic," but Mr. Alden's skilful 
and faithful hand is still at the editorial helm of " Har- 
per's Magazine," whose course he has directed so long 

and well. 

■ • • 

Some interesting notes on the technique of 
poetry are contributed to the November " Fortnightly 
Review " by Mr. Charles F. Keary. Rejecting the 
theory that poetry is merely translated prose, as Camden 
and Ben Jonson professed to believe, Mr. Keary main- 
tains that the poet thinks in lines, not in single words. 
Passion seeks utterance in phrases. Singing, it has been 
conjectured, preceded articulate speech, and the unit of 
song is not a single soxmd, but a musical phrase, which, 
in some sort of cadence and contrast of sound, must 
have been evoked by emotion before language was 
formed. Verse is neither an accident nor a choice nor a 
trick, nor a translation of prose, but a necessity for cer- 
tain modes of thought and feeling. The caesura Mr. 
Keary makes to follow the stressed word in the line, 
and if there is more than one such word there is more 
than one csesura. Incidentally, the writer says that 
Shakespeare's prose is often used for greater impres- 
siveness. " It is certain," he writes, " that Hamlet's 
personality never shows itself more vividly than when 
he speaks in prose "; and he quotes in illustration from 
the very grave-digging scene which Sill (see " The 
Prose of Edward Rowland Sill ") some years ago cited 
to prove the opposite. Sill declares that when Hamlet 
speaks prose " there is no deep feeling or earnestness of 
purpose in what he says." Shy lock, according to Mr. 
Keary, is "never so tremendous as in his prose out- 
bursts " (" Hath not a Jew eyes ? Hath not a Jew 
hands ? " etc.) ; while Sill maintains that the trivial 
business of every-day life is what gets itself expressed 
in Shakespeare's prose. Each is partly right, partly 
wrong; but Sill is probably supported by more examples. 
• • • 

The reading habits of our people are interest- 
ingly revealed by Mr. Gustave Michaud in the Novem- 
ber " Putnam's Monthly." Statistics of book-circulation 
in public libraries tend to show that New England, as 
might have been expected, is far more given to reading 
than the rest of the country, and that of the New En- 
gland states Massachusetts stands well in the lead, with 
Connecticut second and New Hampshire third. The 



fourth place is held, not by an Eastern state, but by Cali- 
fornia; after which come, in order, Vermont, New York, 
Maine, Rhode Island, Montana, Delaware, the District 
of Columbia, Cplorado, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Ohio, 
Michigan, and Illinois. At the other end of the scale 
the list reads backward from Florida, Mississippi, Ala- 
bama, and Arkansas, through other Southern states, 
where the colored population greatly depresses the 
average. Gold-seekers, or other miners for wealth, ap- 
pear to bring up this average in the mineral regions. 
The British gold-mining colonies, too, are great book- 
consumers. The reading habit and visions of Eldorado 
— do they go together? One other significant fact : New 
England, which leads in book-reading, has also by far 
the highest birth-rate of geniiis. 
• • • 
French praise of an American author is found, 
in generous measure, in a 29-page review of " The 
House of Mirth," in the Revue des Deux Mondes of No- 
vember 1. This very commendatory notice of Mrs. 
Wharton and her work is from the pen of Mme. Blanc 
("Th. Bentzon"), who has already, notably in the case 
of Colonel Higginson, expressed her appreciation of cur- 
rent American literature in the pages of the Revue. In 
Mme. Blanc's opinion, Mrs. Wharton " has written per- 
haps the best novel that has appeared this year in En- 
glish "; and further, " Mrs. Wharton can write nothing 
that lacks distinction"; she is "infinitely witty," her 
characters talk charmingly (causent a ravir), and "we 
know of no dialogues better carried tlirough than hers." 
This critic calls " The House of Mirth " as interesting 
and as pitiless a novel, at one end of the world and at 
one extremity of the social ladder, as Zola's L'Assommoir 
at the other. " The chief difference is that its author 
has the marvellous gift of saying everything tactfully, 
in precise language, which, without avoiding anything, 
never offends against modesty."

" DEVIOUS METHODS OF BOOK ADVERTISING." 

THE PUBLISHERS' SIDE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial. J) 

We have read with interest the communication of 
your correspondent. Professor Parsons, of Colorado 
College, in regard to a note which he finds in the vol- 
ume " From a College Window," by Mr. Benson, pub- 
lished by our house. 

Professor Parsons takes the ground that to utilize 
in a work of literature a note so worded as to constitute 
an advertisement of another book, is bad form; and that 
nothing in the shape of an advei'tisement ought to be 
connected with the text of a work of literature. 

We find ourselves fully in accord with this position. 
The publishers are, of course, responsible for the text 
of any volume issued with their imprint. It may be in 
order to explain, however, that this particular note was 
added, while the work was going through the press, by 
the hand of an over-zealous proofreader ; and until our 
attention was called to the matter through The Dial, 
we had in fact no knowledge that any such note had 
been inserted. Instructions have been given for the 
cancelling of this note before the printing of another 
edition of the Benson volume.

A Distinguished Holiday Art-book.* 



The perfecting of photo-mechanical processes 
for reproducing drawings has made possible a 
class of books for which there is reason to be 
grateful. Ownership of original works by ac- 
knowletlged masters of the brush and pencil is 
necessarily the privilege of the few. Exhibited 
in art musevmis and public galleries they may 
be viewe<l by the many, but under conditions 
that make long looking a weariness to the flesh, 
absorjjtion in the joy of aesthetic contemplation 
soon giving way under the distraction of physi- 
cal discomfort. And long looking is for most 
people the only |)athway to assimilation. At 
best a public collection can impart but in rare 
instances, even to its frequenters, that sense of 
intimate personal relation bet^veen the observer 
and the things observetl through which alone 
art becomes a part of life and a tonic to the 
sold. For this, nothing else can take the place 
of the clase dady association which the true art- 
lover feels to be vital to his spiritual well-being. 

Such lx)oks as •' The Drawings of Jean 
Francois Millet '" minister directly to this need 
by briugiug examples of the work of a great 
master within the reach of people of moderate 
means. Fifty of this artist's drawings, repro- 
duced in photo-lithography by the Hentschel- 
colortyjje process, with an introductory essay by 
Leonce Beuedite, make up a volume that can 
fitly be described as distinguished. The exam- 
ples given have been selected with the design of 
covering as wide a range as possible. They 
show well the method of the artist as applied to 
varying themes. Most of them are studies in 
crayon or charcoal for pictures afterward painted 
in oil. One, the chaiining sketch entitled " The 
River." was done entirely with the brush. The 
majority are in simple black and white ; a few 
have slight touches of other hues. In one, the 
original study in colored chalks for " The 
Angelus," the complete color-scheme is effect- 
ively indicated. Taken together, they form a 
fairly representative collection. Included among 
them are studies for such well-kno\sTi paintings 
as " The Gleaners " (now in the Louvre), the 
" Charcoal Burner's Hut,'' " Going to the 
Fields." •• The Sower," •• The Mideteer," " The 
New-liom Calf,*' '' Shepherdess and Flock at

the Edge of the Forest," and " The Vine Dres- 
ser." It woidd have been well had the sizes and 
the whereabouts of the originals been indicated. 
In passing, it may be remarked that these 
drawings are not, as stated on the title-page, 
** of " Millet, but are by him. This locution is 
becoming almost as common as the dreadful 
" different to " that mars the workmanship of 
so many English writers. 

It may Ije taken as a general rule that an 
artist's sketches and studies often exhibit more 
force than his finished pictures. However skil- 
ful the replication, some loss is inevitable. Of 
the truth of this. Millets works afford a con- 
spicuous example. It is to his drawings rather 
than his pictures that we must look for that 
most precious quality, "the instant magic of 
the realizing hand," as it has been aptly termed. 
These sketches and studies serve also to empha- 
size the truth — a truth imperfectly realized by 
most of our modem artists — that the basis of 
all art that is worthy of the name Ls composition. 
In the last analysis, the secret of Millet's power 
to charm avlQ be found to lie in the skill with 
which he brought all the elements of his designs 
into harmonic unity. The extreme simplicity 
of many of them gives at first sight the impres- 
sion that they afforded no opportunity- for the 
exercise of such refinement. As a matter of fact, 
the niceties of composition are in inverse pro- 
portion to its complexity : the simplest is the 
most exacting, and calls for the truest feeling. 

Few artists of modem times have been more 
written and talked about than Jean Fran9ois 
Millet. The story of his life is almost a house- 
hold woi-d. AVho does not know about his boy- 
hood on his father's farm at Gruchy : of the 
gentle home-life in which he was there rearetl ; 
of the years of bitter struggle in Paris ; of his 
retirement to Barbizon, and his devotion thence- 
forth to rustic themes : of the greatness and 
tenderness of his heart ; of his pathetic battle 
with poverty ; of the indifference of the public 
during his lifetime and the fame he has since 
achieved? His devotion in his later years to 
the expression of what he use<l to call ''■la vie 
de Vensemble " — the life of the universe as a 
whole, — and the extraordinary degree in which 
his ai-t was made the vehicle of his thought, has 
causetl attention to be centred upon its sub- 
jective qualities almost to the exclusion of its 
aesthetic side. It is not strange that it should 
be so. The more cai-efully his draA^dngs are 
studied the more apparent is it that technique 
was nothing to him except as a means to an end. 
But also will it be perceived that to make us

feel with him the dignity of human labor and 
man's relation to the planet he inhabits, there 
had to be the master's sensitiveness to beauty of 
line, and the unerring sense of harmonic propor- 
tion by which he ordered his darks and lights, 
his masses and vacant spaces. Otherwise we 
should have had sermons only, not works of art. 

There would be no need of calling attention 
to this so particularly were it not so commonly 
overlooked. Unlike the human message em- 
bodied in the artist's work, it does not insist 
upon recognition, nor does it appeal to such a 
wide audience. For upon their subjective side 
Millet's compositions touch us all. We must, 
if we are not hopelessly devoid of all sympathy 
with human emotion, feel the reverent tender- 
ness in such drawings as "The Knitting Les- 
son," the "Young Mother Nursing her Baby," 
and the " Almsgiving " — to name a few of those 
reproduced in the volume under consideration. 
And who can fail to be affected by the charm 
of the masterly " Shepherdess and Flock at the 
Edge of the Forest," or the realism, impressive 
despite its sketchy treatment, of the " Charcoal 
Burner's Hut " in winter ? 

The tone values of the original drawings and 
the quality of the artist's line have been excep- 
tionally well preserved in the reproductions 
before us. More than this can hardly be asked ; 
but in calling them. Jacairnlles a claim is made 
that is not strictly accurate, as the shiny surface 
of the paper upon which they are printed con- 
stitutes a substantial difference in the result. 
Doubtless, in selecting a paper having this un- 
pleasant characteristic the publishers were actu- 
ated by the desire to obviate as far as possible 
the chief shortcoming in all mechanical repro- 
ductions. The tendency is to modify both the 
lights and darks, with the result of taking away 
some of the vivacity, the " life," of the draw- 
ing. The difficulty is the greater when, as in 
the case of Millet, the drawings were made 
without any thought of their suitability for 
" processing." Our modern illustrators, in an 
endeavor to overcome this tendency, force their 
work into an abnormal key by greatly intensify- 
ing both the high lights and the deep shadows. 

In his admirable introductory essay, Mr. 
Benedite reviews the leading events in Millet's 
life-history. With fine appreciation, the excep- 
tional figure of the master is set before the 
reader, special attention being given to his re- 
lation to the ideals current in his day. Thus, 
he shows how it was that the semi-recluse who 
held himself aloof from the movement with 
which his name is inevitably associated — the 



man who always painted resignation, never re- 
volt, and who asserted that he liad " never 
dreamt of pleading a cause of any sort " — was 
the forerunner and in a sense the prophet of 

the realists. „ ,,^ ^

Biographies ix Holiday Fokm.* 

In a group of handsomely illustrated bio- 
graphies, individual and collective, that await 
review, the ladies, of various sorts and condi- 
tions, and of reputations spotless and otherwise, 
are in an overwhelming majority. Thus we find 
— curious conjunction I — George Eliot rubbing- 
elbows with Lady Hamilton, Hortense Mancini, 
the "wanton Shrewsbury," and numerous others 
of not unblemished fame. Some readers may be 
so cruel as to see a certain significance in bracket- 
ing with these notorious offenders the great 
novelist who dared to violate English marriage 
law and custom. But in this instance the asso- 
ciation is purely one of chance, not of design. 
While many of the women treated of in these 
works are not characters that the lover of bio- 
graphy is warmly interested m, yet their doings 
and misdoings are discreetly handled, and as 
their names are of more or less historic import- 
ance we must not let our prudery get the better 
of us. The merit of the volumes as handsome 
holiday publications is considerable, but space 
is lacking for anything like detailed criticism of 
the narrative matter accompanying the abun- 
dant and on the whole excellent illustrations. 
In taking up the books, one by one, we give 
the precedence not to the ladies this time, but 
to the lamented stage favorite. Sir Henry Irving.

is sure to be skilfully executed. This latest 
printing of ^Ir. Fitzgerald's work is, he tells us, 
" practically the third Issue. It was written 
under Irving's hearty encouragement, and all 
the earlier sheets were revisetl and corrected by 
him. ... It has been thoroughly revised — 
largre additions have been made which cover a 
period of some ten years, and bring the work 
down to his lamented death." Greater atten- 
tion is given to the man than to the actor, and 
a very winning personality he is made to appear. 
In one of the passages devotetl more especially 
to professional matters, some comparison is 
drawn between Irving and Booth, as they ap- 
jjeared together at the Lyceum in 1881 ; and 
the honors are emphatically given to the host, 
the actor who trod his own boartls, rather than 
to the \Tsitor amid strange surroundings. It is 
more than implied, too, that Booth failetl to 
requite his host's hospitality when the English 
actor \nsitetl America. Prejudices in his friend's 
favor are excusable in the author, and so are 
dramatic criticisms with which the reader can- 
not always agree. This volume cannot compete 
in wealth of dttaU with Mr. Bram Stoker's 
longer work already noticed in these pages ; but 
it can well supplement it, and perhaps the two 
can on some points serve as a sort of check to 
each other. Both are written by friends of some 
thirty years standing. There is still room, how- 
ever, for a full critical account of Ir^'ins: the 
actor. In one of his closing paragraphs ^Ir. 
Fitzgerald laments (rather incoherently, it is 
true) that " though some months have elapsed 
since his [Irving's] death, the gi-eat actor's 
name is scarcely mentioned. He seems, indeed, 
forgotten. For many a ' cheap ' celebrity, there 
are committees and subscriptions and memorials 
and statues ; but nothing of the kind has ever 
been suggestetl.'" Mr. Fitzgerald justly prides 
himself on the number and excellence of the 
illustrations he has pro^^ded for this book from 
his '• twenty huge folios '" of Irving pictures. 

The Rev. Wdliam Mottram has collected into 
a book his series of articles on George Eliot 
originally contributed to " The Leisure Hour," 
and four new chapters are added. First cousin, 
once removed, to George Eliot, he wTites with 
the authority of near kinship and familiar asso- 
ciation. From an unpublished autobiography 
of Seth Bede (Samuel Evans) and a brief pub- 
lishetl autobiography of Dinah Morris (^Irs. 
Samuel Evans), the author reproduces some 
noteworthy passages. The original of jVIrs. 
Poyser he finds in the novelist's mother, and of 
Adam Bede in her father. With something: of 



a flourish, he gives us a chapter explaining and 
justifying her relations with G. H. Lewes as if 
he were publishing new facts ; but he offers 
hardly anj^thing not already known to students 
of her life. As a whole, the book is written in 
a tone of alternate religious devotion and per- 
sonal panegyric that becomes tiresome to the less 
piously enthusiastic. The eighty-six portraits 
and illustrations are good process prints, and 
rival the text in interest. Especially is this true 
of a surprisingly atti*active fi-ontispiece portrait 
of Georsre Eliot in her voungf womanhood. 

" This is not a history," admits Mr. Philip 
Gibbs, in prefacing his " Men and Women of 
the French Revolution'": and he proceeds to 
style it '• rather, jserhaps, a psychological study 
of some of the actors in the great drama, so 
arranged, however, that the thread of narrative 
is not confusetl or lost." The text of this book, 
he frankly avows, '• does not compare in interest 
with the illustrations. They are the excuse and 
the value of the volume. These contemporary' 
French prints, mostly reproduced for the first 
time in this coimtry, are surprisingly inter- 
esting." In thus deviating from the beaten 
jjaths of history and giving rather free play 
to his own fancy in this " psychological study," 
the author has produced a work more attractive 
in some respects than the formal chronicles of 
the periotl. As a handsome holiday book that 
may induce some to enter upon a more serious 
study of what the author rightly considers " a 
period of inexhaustible interest," the work is of 
value . The numerous photogravnires are works of 
art. the quarto size of the page contributing not 
a little to their excellence. Of the many impor- 
tant characters whose portraits had to be omitted 
simply because some limit wa.s necessary, one 
notes especially the omission of Charlotte Corday 
and Louis XVI. 

In the annals of woman's fraUt}-, ]Mr. W. R. H. 
Trowbridge's "*■ Court Beauties of Old White- 
hall " will take no prominent place either for 
original research or for naughty piquancy of 
style. These " Historiettes of the Restoration," 
as the sketches are called in a sub-title, give in 
readable form the stories of eight lovely butter- 
flies that fluttered about the radiance of ^o^'altl»^ 
most of them singeing: their wingfs more or less, 
and most of them also ending their days in ob- 
scurity if not in wretchedness. It is significant 
that, of these eight brief biographies, the ac- 
coimt of the Comtesse de Gramont, "la belle 
Hamilton," the best woman of them all, is the 
shortest ; so much more eventful are the annals 
of \'ice than the colorless chronicles of virtue.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



The volume has thirty-two portraits, inchiding 
a fii'st reproduction of the only extant likeness 
of Armand, Comte de Guiche. The author 
speaks of this as engraved from the original ; 
but it is evidently a process print, and either 
a very poor one or from a blurred and faded 
painting', — probably the latter. The chapters, in 
their order, treat of Hortense Mancini, Duchesse 
de Mazarin ; Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleve- 
land ; " la belle Stuart," Duchess of Richmond ; 
"la belle Hamilton," Comtesse de Gramont ; 
" the lovely Jennings," Duchess of Tyrconnel ; 
"wanton Shrewsbury," Anna Maria, Countess 
of Shrewsbury ; " Madame," Henrietta, Duchess 
of Orleans ; and Louise de Keroual, Duchess 
of Portsmouth. 

The subject of the first chapter of the book 
just mentioned reappears as the leading char- 
acter in Mr. H. Noel Williams's " Five Fair 
Sisters . ' ' Hortense Mancini and her four sisters 
receive the honor of a 422-page history at the 
hands of this prolific author of French memoirs. 
Of these sisters, the eldest, Laure, who married 
the Due de Mercoeur and became the mother of 
the Due de Vendome (renowned in the Marl- 
borough wars), appears to have been the only 
one of unchallenged virtue, being also the one 
of least personal beauty ; while Olympe, Marie, 
and Hortense — the three really meant when 
reference is made to Mazarin 's nieces — attained 
to European fame of an unenviable sort. De- 
tails cannot here be entered into concerning 
these ingenuously immoral young ladies, nor is 
it necessary, vnth so full an account of the 
Mancini family now at the reader's service. 
Lely's portrayal of Hortense's seductive charms 
forms the frontispiece in a handsome photogra- 
vure ; and photograjjhic reproductions of nu- 
merous other portraits, including her four sisters, 
are interspersed through the volume. Scattering 
footnotes mention some of the numerous me- 
moirs available for the making of such books as 
Mr. Williams's. 

A sumptuous set of twenty-three large plates 
of Lady Hamilton's portraits by Romney, Rey- 
nolds, Lawrence, Mme. Le Brun, and Masque- 
rier, furnishes Mr. J. T. Herbert Baily, editor 
of " The Connoisseur," an excuse for telling 
anew her rather pathetic story in his " Emma, 
Lady Hamilton." Romney 's numerous Cassan- 
dras and Circes and Bacchantes, depicting in 
various costumes and attitudes the charms of 
this Trilby-like beauty, are more or less familiar. 
Mr. Baily's narrative, short and readable, is 
apologetic and even warmly eulogistic in tone, 
and may well be supplemented and corrected by 



some less favorable presentation of the famous 
courtesan. An antidote is found, for example, 
in a reference to her from a letter of Sir Gilbert 
Eliot to his wife, wherein he speaks of her as 
showing the ease of a barmaid, and adds that 
" her person is nothing short of monstrous," and 
" her language and conversation (with men) are 
exaggerations of anything I ever heard any- 
where." This, to be sure, was when she had 
attained to matronly maturity. Of two of the 
four children commonly said to have been born 
to the fair Emma, this biographer makes no 
mention ; and he repeats the seemingly false 
account of her death in such poverty that she 
had to be buried in a deal coffin at the cost of 
a charitable English lady, Paget's memoirs 
relate, on the authority of Lady Hamilton's 
daughter, that she was buried in an oak coffin 
and with a degree of ceremony that brought the 
funeral expenses up to £2,8 10s. Readers of 
" Fenwick's Career " will enjoy the more than 
hasty glimpse of Romney that this book affords. 
The list of engraved portraits of Lady Hamilton 
enumei-ates more than forty such reproductions, 
much the gTeater number being after Romney. 
A wealth of elaborate embroidery upon a pov- 
erty of historic fact is furnished in the 358 large 
pages of Miss Marie Hay's pseudo-biography 
entitled " A German Pompadour." So far as 
vice can be rendered attractive by throwing on 
it the glamour of romance, the un virtuous life 
of Wilhelmine von GrJivenitz, mistress of Eber- 
hard Ludwig, Duke of Wiirtemberg, has been 
thus treated in being made to serve as the theme 
of a love story that is not uninteresting as a skil- 
ful bit of fiction, and has something even of salu- 
tary warning in its gloomy ending. The author 
writes with a clever woman's knowledge of the 
human heart, but her style occasionally borders 
on the luscious, as may be illustrated by a sen- 
tence from an early chapter representing the 
heroine as poised on the giddy brink of her ruin. 
The Didce has wrapped Wilhelmine's cloak 
about her, and " as he did so his hand involun- 
tarily touched the soft skin of her shoidder, and 
Eberhard Ludwig flushed to the edge of his white 
curled peruke as he murmured : ' Au revoir, 
Philomele ! ' and Wilhelmine daringly whis- 
pered back : ' Au revoir, gentil poete.' " The 
words " bigamist " and " bigamy " are misused 
by the author, who applies them to Wilhelmine 
and her conduct in marrying the already- wedded 
Duke. " The mills of God grind slow, but they 
grind exceeding sure," she writes, in quotation 
marks, altering without improving the familiar 
renderino" of this line from Friedrieh von Loirau.

Nature-Books fok the Holidays.* 

Lovers of out-door life have much to be thank- 
ful for this season in the variety and good qual- 
ity of the new books which have stored up the 
memory of summer days for winter use. One 
satisfactory generalization which can be made 
about them is that they are fairly sane with 
regard to the value of human life as compared 
with animal life. ^lan is admitted to be the 
equal of most of the creatures he has dominion 
over, — or, rather, it is admitted that he may 
be their equal if he \nR learn from them the 
lessons he was meant to learn. Now no natvire- 
lover objects to being sent to the ant for instruc- 
tion, or to any created thing that walks or 
crawls or flies, provided only that after he has 
gone to them he may be credited with the wis- 
dom he has acquired, and be recognized as 
hiniseK belonging to a hopeful species. This 
spirit of tolerance toward hmnanity so far pre- 
vails in the season's books that one may read 
them without being oppressed by a sense of his 
own inferiority — unless indeed he is a himter,

for in that case he is of course hopeless. The 
author who preferred a dead snake to a live man 
or woman has not spoken recentiy, either with 
his own voice or that of any of his colleagues. 

The most sumptuous nature-book of the year, 
Mr. Beebe's " Log of the Sun," is also, as its 
title indicates, the most comprehensive. Any 
one who absorbs this book will become in his 
own jjerson a fairly accomplished naturalist, 
besides having a very good time in the process. 
Mr. Beebe scarcely carries out his intention of 
keeping the bird's or insect's jx)int of view, but 
he succeeds nevertheless in his main purpose, 
which is '' to reveal beauties which are wholly 
invisible from the usual himian view-point." 
Whether he writes of biixLs that have so far 
learned the lesson of natures economy as to use 
the cast-off fur of animals for their nests, or of 
night-hawks that nest upon the tar-and-gravel 
roofs of city houses, or of the squid that changes 
color at will, drawing its color cells together 
untU they seem confluent, — •' as if the freckles 
on a person's face should all be joinetl together," 
— he communicates secrets which only intimate 
acquaintance woidd have discovered. Keeping 
the log of the year week by week somewhat 
disturbs the continuity of subject, making many 
digressions and returns necessary ; but no real 
inconvenience residts, since the book is too large 
for continuous reading. It will be used rather 
for reference and inspiration, a chapter or two 
at a time. Mr. Stones fifty-two full-page draw- 
ings in color, and the generous number of pho- 
tographs, desei^-e an appreciable share of credit 
for the admiration the book will receive. Espe- 
cially the photographs of snow-flakes, and of 
jelly-fish and other forms of sea life, are mar- 
vels of skill. The titles of chapters which con- 
sider imusual subjects are •• The Personality of 
Trees," •' Ghosts of the Earth " (mushrooms 
and toad-stools), " Turtle Traits," " Insect Mu- 
sic," " Night Music of the Swamp," — but the 
list is too long to finish. One of the most valu- 
able suggestions of the lxK)k is that civilization 
may be a boon to birds and insects if man so 
wills, as is witnessed by the fact that sixty-one 
species of biixls nested last summer in the New 
York Zoological Park, *• while many places of 
equal area in the covmtry which are harried by 
boys and eats are tenanted by a bare dozen 
species." 

:Mr. Stewart E. White's " The Pass " is an 
account of how the explorer, with his vs-ife, his 
guide, and their two dogs and four horses, made 
the first crossing from the head- waters of Roaring 
River to those of the Kaweah. It is told simply.

in a style as crisp as mountain air. Though 
the author writes modestly of the " petty but 
real difficulties to be met with on such an ex- 
pedition," and says that "anyone could have 
done it," the reader recognizes the heroic en- 
deavor. It scarcely seems a petty difficidty when 
Dinkey, "the cocky, self-confident little horse," 
falls over the edge of a precipice, or Old Slob 
overjumps on a slippery bridge, or especially 
when the whole party, worn and bruised, are 
turned back late in the day to retrace steps 
which have taken them since sunrise, or when 
they make their final descent across the face of 
a sheer cliff on a hair-line ledge which is scarcely 
visible in a photograph. The book is of good 
size, and has dainty marginal sketches, with 
some attractive full-page illustrations. 

From lower levels of a neighboring region 
comes Mrs. Austin's unique study of " The 
Flock." The poetic temperament which so well 
fits Mrs. Austin for \vi-iting stories of the West 
has been of equal advantage to her m telling 
of the shepherd-life, with " its background of 
wild beauty, mixed romance, and unaffected 
savagery." A prefatory chapter, "which is 
not on any accoimt to be omitted," tells how in 
1770 Rivera y Moncada brought the first flocks 
from Velicata to the newly-founded Mission at 
San Diego, and how ever since, in that land of 
" the indolent lapping of the nights and days," 
the dust and blether of a flock has been a rescue 
" from the clutch of great Tedium." Lambing- 
time, shearing, the work and character of dogs 
and shejiherds, the depredations of enemies, 
and the journeys through valleys, up mountain 
slopes, and across open ranges, are described with 
an eye quick to see and a word competent to 
suggest every sig-nificant and picturesque detail. 
It is not often that a reader can have such 
implicit trust in an author's use of words as in 
Mrs. Austin's. What, for instance, could be 
more accurate or more musical than this account 
of the coming of night in the mountains ? 

" In the Wild, the night moves forward at an impulse 
tiowiug from unknowable control. Darkness comes out 
of the ground and wells up to the canon rims, light still 
diffusing through the upper sky, a world of light beyond 
our world. Few things besides man suffer a check in 
their affairs. The wind treads about the forest litter 
on errands of its own ; yoii hear it but the more jjlainly, 
as if blackness were a little less resistant to somid." 

Whatever is needed by the imagination that 
words cannot supply is given by Mr. Smith's 
skiKul but unobtrusive drawings. 

Usually foreign nature-books are less inter- 
esting than our own, because we know too little 
of the places and the life they describe. But 



this stricture does not apply to the volumes 
by Mr. Dewar and Mr, Crawford, " Bombay 
Ducks " and " From Fox's Earth to Mountain 
Tarn." Both these books, one treating of the 
birds and small animals of India, the other of 
wild life in Scotland, are of ample size, with 
excellent photogi*aphs, and both touch upon sub- 
jects of more than local interest. Mr. Dewar 
explains in his preface that though the term 
" Bombay Ducks " really means pieces of dried 
fish, he has chosen to use it for the birds and 
animals in which he is interested. He treats of 
them like a writer, not like a scientist forced to 
use his pen in the service of his subject ; and 
his style is piquant and refreshing. On Eliza 
Cook's saying that " Linnets teach us how to 
love, and ring-doves how to pi'ay," the author 
comments : 

" Had that estimable and well-meaning lady invested 
eighteenpence in one of the cooing community she might 
have said of them ' They teach us how to swear.' But 
the question woidd arise, do men need to be taught that 
accomplishment ? I am inclined to think that swearers, 
like poets, are born, not made." 

Such glints of philosophy keep the l^ook, ex- 
haustive as it is, from ever beconiing: dull. 

Mr. Crawford's book, " From Fox's Earth to 
Mountain Tarn," makes an equally thorough 
study of the wild life of Scotland, traversing the 
country from Ailsa Crag and the Tweed to the 
Shetlands. The contention of the book is that 
sport, in the artificial form it has taken, is de- 
stroying wild life. For the sake of the hunt, the 
fox is allowed to thrive, though he destroys 
grouse, pheasant, and rabbit ; to make room for 
putting-greens on the coast golf-links, terns and 
eider ducks are driven from their breeding- 
places. Worst of all, the falcon, " the sporting 
bird that woiUd rather a long chase than an easy 
capture, rather a swift wing than a fat meal," is 
being exterminated. Thus sport becomes ugly, 
when there is no longer " the instinct of fair 
play, which is the vital spark of sport." Mr. 
Crawford has a way of saying things that makes 
one think. The debt of the huntsman to the 
birds whose swiftness disciplines his marksman- 
ship is thus effectively pointed out : 

" The falcon gave the flight feathers, lengthened and 
pointed the wing. The eagle touched the plumage with 
moorland hues, whose charm was the greater because 
of the exquisite sympathy. The reaction is marked ; 
the eye of the eagle became keener. Even the by-play 
is of infinite interest. The protective shades of grouse 
give the nose of the pointer ; less cunningly hidden, and 
a coarser sense were enough. An interesting three are 
grouse, sportsman, and dog. The hawk established 
their delicate relations."

good general observarion of wild life in our own 
conntrv'. is Mr. Ingersoll's " The Wit of the 
Wild." Interesting comparisons with man's 
ways are the most tmique feature of the book ; 
for instance, the wasp's habit of storing up 
spiders for her larvie is calle<l •• life insurance 
for wasps,", and the rattlesnakes '• shaking of 
castanets," the coloring of fire-toatls, the songs 
of bii"ds and calls of animals at ma ting-time, are 
describetl in a chapter on '• Animals that Ad- 
vertise. ' A chapter on *• Bluffing " leads to the 
conclusion that "•' animaLs are probably able to 
bluff more effectively thau men, because they 
are in such deatUy earnest about it and do it so 
often." If there are no sti-ikingly new facts in 
^Ir. Ingersoll's book, there is a new way of em- 
phasizing old ones, and '*a truth of simplicity 
which constitutes a charm often lacking in 
elaborate fiction." 

The thi-ee stories of individual animals — 
''Scraggles.' "ShaggACoat," and ''White Fang" 
— are destinetl for ix)pidarity, ^\-ith scarcely a 
choice as to which l)est deserves it. Perhaps 
Mr. James's touching history of Scraggles, the 
impromising little song-spaii-ow which he took 
to his home and his heart for its thi-ee months' 
life, \n\l appeal most to girls ; but they are not 
the only ones to whom it vriB. appeal. Scraggles 
tells her own story of how she became the Pro- 
fessor s companion, helping liiiu wTite his book 
on the Old Missions of California, foUowing him 
out of doors on his walks, and sleeping in his 
shoes. Onlv at last, when her strengfth fails, 
does the author take up the pen in his own j)er- 
son and complete the tearfid little record. 

'' Shaggycoat," Mr. Clarence Hawkes's story 
of a beaver, will l>e fascinating to boys, though 
they again wUl not be the only ones. Attention 
is called to the fact that the Hudson Bay Com- 
pany, and many great families — the Astors, 
for instance — owe much of their wealth to this 
industrioiLs builder, who, '' like the red man, is 
a true American, for he was here before Colum- 
bus, and whose jjelt was the prize for which the 
wilderness was scouretl." Mr. Hawkes gives 
this important animal biography in a simple, 
straightforward way, and earns our gratitude by 
leaving it with a happy ending in spite of the 
fact that the beaver trilie is l>eing ruthlessly 
wiped out. 

In " White Fang." Mr. Jack London has 
given us a book that probably will be more read 
than an^-thing else he has written. It is a re- 
markable stoiy for its own sake, and is further 
remarkable for being the converse of " The Call 
of the Wild." The hero of " The Call of the 



Wild " is a dog with wolf blood, who goes from 
a home where he is loved and petted, through 
experiences of hardship and brutalitj", back to 
the life of the wilderness. White Fang, a wolf 
with dog blood, is liom in the wUdemess, and 
after experiences of hardship and brutality is 
brought at last to a home where he is loved and 
petted. There is as much that goes against the 
reader's sympathy in one book as in the other : 
but because the story of White Fang ends hap- 
pily, much of the cruelty in it \*t11 be forgiven 
and forgotten. The early life of White Fang 
is narrated with an understanding of animal 
psychology which seems almost uncanny, yet 
shows Mr. London's power in one of its best 
phases. When the young dog- wolf first saw the 
Indians about their camp-fire " a great awe de- 
scended upon him. ... In dim ways he recog- 
nized in man the animal that had fought itseK 
to primacy over other animals of the Wild." 
He joins the camp, and Ijecomes the dog of 
Gray Beaver. His master is his god, but not 
for love. " There were deeps in his nature which 
had never been sounded. A kind word, a caress- 
ing touch of the hand, on the part of Gray 
Beaver might have sounded these deeps; but 
Gray Beaver did not caress nor speak kind 
words. His primacy was savage." The reign 
of hate brings White Fang to be the fighting- 
dog of a white man. But from his last fight — 
and there is no more blood-curdling dog-fight 
in literature — he is rescued by the love-master. 
By this patient, kind man, his brute nature is 
redeemed, and for the master he loves he leams 
to endure the restraints of cixdlization. The book 
will be judged inferior to " The Call of the 
Wild " by sticklei-s for " strong " endings ; 
nevertheless it will \)e more enjoyed by the 
mass of readers. 

A finely-made book, whose open print and 
abundant pictiu^s will especiallj* delight old 
people, is Mr. Huston's " Around an Old Home- 
stead." This " lx)ok of memories,' though it 
celebi-ates a particular house, vnR serve to stir 
home memories in the heart of anyone who has 
lived in the country. It has much to say of 
the house itself, the open fire, the orchards, the 
woods, the squirrels, the dogs, and the acti\"ities 
of farm life. If the citing of authors, from 
Tennyson to W. C. Gray — and one can scarcely 
think of anything appropriate that has been 
omitted — seems to the over-critical too plentif id 
and premeditatetl, it will probably not seeiu so 
to those who take their reading in snatches. 

Since the study of out-door nature leads as 
certaiidy to philosophy as does that of human 



390 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



nature, it is not strange that two of the new 
books in our list should be given over to philoso- 
phizing. Dr. Abbott's " Rambles of an Idler" 
does not attempt to point a moral, except that 
it is well to ramble and enjoy ones self. The 
author "goes hand in hand with day-dreams," 
and his mind makes material out of whatever his 
eye lights ujjon. His philosophy, if discursive, 
is cheerful and pertinent, — as in this example : 
" I find, where I walk, a rusty pan among the dead 
leaves and a vesper mouse has made a snug home of it. 
It suggests that the art of much comfort from little is 
better than supposititious ease from much. He really 
does not enjoy nature who demands it in excess, and 
must have oceans and mountains, and spurns the uaodest 
hills and wood-girt ponds that are roimd about him." 

The book is good proof of how genially a man is 
affected who spends much time in the sunshine. 

In contrast with the general tone of Dr. Ab- 
bott's philosophy is the particiUar intention of 
Mr. Long s. The object of " Briar Patch Philos- 
ophy " is to establish the thesis that animals 
think. The words are put into the mouth of 
"Peter Rabbit,' but as this plan affects the 
manner of them only to the extent of naming the 
Rabbit "I" and human beings "you," the author- 
ship is not much disguised. Mr. Long bases 
his belief that animals think on the fact, admitted 
by all great naturalists, that they have minds, 
and the theory tliat since the laws of the uni- 
verse are constant the laws of mind must be con- 
stant. ' ' Any truth, therefore, which you discover 
about your own mind — which constitutes your 
psychology — must apply to any mind in the 
imiverse, wherever you find it." That is, since 
animals have minds, they must use them as men 
use theirs. The reasoning, though supported by 
charac.teristically close observation, is from anal- 
ogy, and readers wiU value the conclusions accord- 
ing to their valuation of that method. Certainly 
Mr. Long carries it rather far when he says : 

" Your dog certainly does not obtain his idea of a 
master's spirit through the senses, for to his senses man 
is not nearly so powerful or noble as many of your great 
beasts. Whatever idea your dog has of you, as his 
Master, is the recognition in you of some mental or 
spiritual quality, and is gained by him through some 
mental or spiritual perception. What is there, therefore, 
to prevent all animals from feeling more or less surely 
the simple presence of one whom all your religions rec- 
ognize as a master and ruler of the solitudes, present and 
active in all things, though no mortal eye can see him 
nor any ear hear the sound of his footsteps ? " 

Still, if one cannot foUow Mr. Long in grant- 
ing religion and a belief in immortality to dumb 
creatures, one cannot help enjoying the clever- 
ness with which he defends his belief. " Peter 
Rabbit" sees some things about his human 
neighbors that make him wonder if they think. 



Why is it, he asks, that " to change a habit of 
thinking among men requires centuries, and 
generally the blood of a few martyrs ; while the 
animal changes his smiple habits in a single 
generation, led by his own reasonable experi- 
ence " ? Why do men eat when they are not 
hungry, breathe bad air when they might have 
pure air, work for money that they do not need, 
and make slaves of themselves when they might 
be free ? At least " Peter Rabbit " asks ques- 
tions that are hard to answer, and in the end 
wins gratitude for letting poor humans off as 
easily as he does. And Mr. Long, in this seri- 
ous piece of work, has made a contribution ta 
animal study that will have permanent influ- 
ence. It shoidd be said, moreover, that the unus- 
ually animated illustrations save the book from 
being too serious. May Estelle Cook.

England, the book is concerned only with the State 
of New York and with the city of Washington. It 
contains much that is old — old enough, for the 
most part, to have become new again to Dr. Hale's 
readers ; and it is laden with reminiscences from a 
day more remote in feeling than in time. The 
author tells us that the work was inspired by the 
conviction that there are not books enough concern- 
ing travel in these States ; and he set himself to the 
task of remedying this lack in our literature, just as 
he performed a similar ser^^ce for our national 
balladry. His first paragraph reads as follows : 

■' It seems to me curious that so few people write about 
travels in the United States. One in a thousand of the intelli- 
gent Americans who travel in Europe puts his observations 
into print. One in fifty of the people who cross Asia does the 
same ; and every one who crosses Africa does. But of the 
travellers of America, you might count on the fingers of two 
hands all who have written anything worti reading that has 
been printed In the last twenty years." 

The illustrations are profuse and well-chosen, con- 
sisting of reproductions of old prints and portraits 
and photographs of present-day scenes. 

Mr. William T. Hornaday, the well-known travel- 
ler and wi'it«r on natural history, found in the Cana- 
dian Rockies material for what President Roosevelt 
might well call a "bully" travel-book. He went 
there especially to find mountain goats — and he cer- 
tainly found them. A short quotation will show what 
happened while he was studjTug a herd of twenty- 
eight of these animals which their dogs had brought 
to bay long enough to have them photog^phed. 

" Suddenly sharp cries of surprise came up from the camp, 
and I sprang up to look about. Three gxiats were running 
past the tents at top speed, — a big billy, and two smaller 



•' • Hi, there I Goats ! Goats I ' cried Smith and Norboe. 

'■ The cook was stooping over the fire, and looking under 
his right arm he saw the bunch charging straight toward 
him, at a gallop. A second later, the big billy was almost 
upon him. 

" ' Hey I You son-of-a-gun I ' yelled Huddleston. and as 
the big snow-white animal dashed past him he struck it 
across the neck with a stick of firewood. The goat's tracks 
were within six feet of the camp-fire." 

As was to be expected, the book abounds in vivid 
descriptions of wild animals; and it gives also 
many extremely interesting pictures made from pho- 
tographs taken at ranges almost inciedibly close. 

In one or two places in his admirable book, 
"Certain Delightful English Towns." ^1t. W. D. 
HoweUs shows a tendency to apologize to the people 
of England for the unkind words he has sometimes 
written of them. Witness such a paragraph as this : 
■• On the tender was an Englishman whom I asked which 
was the best hotel in Plymouth. At first ne would not com- 
mit himself ; then his humanity began to work in him. and 
he expressed a preference, and abruptly left me. He returned 
directly to give the reasons for his preference, and to excuse 
them, and again he left me. A second time he came back, 
with his con.science fully roused, and conjured me not to 
think of going elsewhere. I thought that charming, and I 
afterwards found the hotel excellent, as I found nearly all 
the hotels in England. I found everything delightful on the 
way to it, inclusive of the cabman's overcharge, which 
brought the extortion to a full thirrl of the just fare of a 
New York cabman.'' 



It would be hard to find fault with a traveller who 
was so prepared to enjoy his sojourn in a strange 
land, and one wherein he felt himself to be no 
stranger. It was this attitude toward life that went 
far towai'd making both journey and the account of 
it so cheerful. The book has the usual charming 
and idiomatic style of Mr. Howells, who should now 
be persuaded to do as much — as much as he can, 
that is — in the same vein for some of our American 
cities. Some charming pen drawings by Mr. Ernest 
Haskell, together with numerous reproductions from 
photog^phs, add not a little to the attractiveness of 
this pleasant volume. 

JVIr. Henry C. Shelley strays even farther from 
the beaten path than does Mr. Howells, for in his 
" Literary By-Paths in Old England " he has under- 
taken to follow the haunts and dwelling-places of 
Spenser, Sidney, William Penn, Gray, Gilbert 
White, Goldsmith, Bums, Keats, Carlyle, and Tom 
Hood, concluding with the multiplicity of literary 
interests that centre in •' royal " Winchester. The 
novelty of the work does not consist so much in new 
discoveries, for there are none of consequence, as in 
presenting his subjects in a light not usual. One 
thinks of Goldsmith, for instance, and one thinks of 
" The Deserted Village " in connection with him ; 
yet somehow it is a novelty to think of Auburn itself, 
as it stands, still deserted, in its (and his) native 
Ireland, and to think of Goldsmith in just that con- 
nection. So Keats, though known to have been a 
chemist and student of medicine, is so entirely the 
poet in the popular estimation that his signatures 
as a student of chemistry and medicine possess a 
curious human interests The book furnishes abun- 
dant opportunity for illustrations, which are supplied 
from photographs taken bj- the author. 

Mr. E. Y. Lucas, in his attractive volume entitled 
"A Wanderer in London." adds his charming prose 
and even an occasional modest verse to his minute 
knowledge of locality and literature, and the result 
is a book well worthy the attention of any visitor, 
actual or intending, to the British capital. Such a 
paragraph as this, chosen quite at random, illustrates 
its wealth of reference and its author's interesting 
manner of presentation : 

" Grosvenor Square is two hundred years old and has had 
many famous residents. It was in an ante-room of the Earl 
of Chesterfield's house here that Johnson cooled his heels and 
warmed his temper. Mr. Thrale died in Grosvenor Square, 
and so did John Wilkes, at No. 30. At No. 22 lived Sir 
William and Lady Hamilton, with ' Yathek ' Beckf ord, and 
thither went Nelson after the battle of the Nile." 

And so on. for page after page, until past and pres- 
ent are allied vrith the strongest ties of association 
and charm of literary treatment. The sixteen col- 
ored pictures by Mr. Nelson Dawson are charming ; 
and there are many other illustrations. 

Mrs. Mona Caird brings a romancer's love of sen- 
timent and an artist's powers of description to her 
'' Romantic Cities of Provence," Avith the happiest 
results. Avignon, Uzes, Barbentane, the lagoons, 
Aries, Tarascon, Beaucaire. Carcassonne, and many

more of these old romantic places, are duly entered, 
their atmosphere absorbed, the local legends studied, 
and the result given in entertaining and often bril- 
liant passages of descriptive writing. In the matter 
of dates and merely useful knowledge, Mrs. Caird 
has been, as she says, " frugal"; but the essentials 
for an understanding of the people are nowhere 
lacking. It is the festival in the beloved city of 
Tarascon that evokes the following : 

"No one can be iu the South, above all in Provence, 
knowing' of its ancient festivals, its music, its farandoles and 
Saracenic dances, and fail to be startled into new realization 
of this element that has psissed out of our life, the menace 
that lies in the pervading dulness, that benumbed worshij) 
of sorrow, of ' work ' and ' duty ' without understanding and 
without freshness, that absence of fantasy and outcry that 
binds the modern world in a terrible and unnatural silence. 
Of what avail is it that the people are law-abiding at the 
cost of the very spi'ing and essence of being ? " 

We are reminded of the annvial protest against such 
few holidays as we permit ourselves, and of the 
curious orgy of work and quest that we regard as an 
essential preparation for them. The book breathes 
the very spirit of holiday. Of equal interest with 
the text are the numerous illustrations from pen- 
drawings by Mr. Joseph Pennell and Mr. Edward 
M. Synge. 

It is no great way from Provence to the begin- 
nmg of Mr. Frederick H. A. Seymour's " Saunter- 
ings in Sjiain," and he has succeeded in giving his 
book something of the same charm, because his first 
interest lies in the cities of the Moors, and they have 
left behind them many elements of joy not essen- 
tially Spanish. The manner in which Seville 
celebrates the feast of Corpus Clu-isti appealed to 
Mr. Seymour as an admirable opportunity to study 
a Spanish crowd, and the following are among his 
observations : 

" The men generally are singularly plain, lint the ladies' 
eyes would deserve a chaptei — or even chaptei-s — to do 
justice to them. The eyes are never still. They glide, they 
swim, they dilate, they contract, thej' half close, they lan- 
^ish, they curve, they sweep round the corners, and, pre- 
ternaturally recovering themselves, they drop upon yours 
with a sudden glow. They do all things that eyes and tongue 
and lips can do. But one thing they cannot do, and that is 
to keep still ; but they never stare." 

Yet the book is more deeply laden with useful knowl- 
edge than most, the studies of the art galleries in 
Spain being particularly close and appreciative. 
Twenty-four reproductions from photographs illum- 
inate the text. 

Mr. Leonard WUliams does not appear sympa- 
thetic with the Spanish character, in his book en- 
titled " Granada: Memories, Adventures, Studies, and 
Impressions." The author is concerned, of course, 
more particularly with the old Moorish kingdom ; 
but he finds time to write a tractate upon the gypsy 
of those parts, introducing into it one story worth 
repeating. 

" Gyp.sy peddlers were hawking brooms about the streets 
and plazas of Granada, when one of them called the other to 
Lis side. ' Speaking,' he .said, ' with perfect frankness, I make 
my brooms miyself , and steal my rushes, my handles, and my 
«ord for binding. Nothing proceeds from me except the 



time employed in manufacture. With these economies my 
lowest possible price is fifteen centimos, and yet you sell for 
twelve. How can you do it for the money ? ' 

" ' Why,' replied the other, unabashed, ' you see I steal my 
brooms ready-made.' " 

A beautiful frontispiece in color from Mr. A. M. 
Foweraker's painting of the Alhambra, together 
with twenty-four reproductions from photographs, 
make up the pictorial equipment of the book. 

One reads with some surprise the name of the 
late Grant Allen on the title-page of a new book, 
" Cities of Northern Italy," and with hardly less 
surprise the naive statement of his supposed colla- 
borator, Mr. George C. Williamson, in the preface, 
from whicla it does not appear that Allen's interest 
or share in the book ever went beyond the stage of 
suggestion, though he did prepare some historical 
guides dealing with the cities now treated. It would 
seem, therefore, as if the question needed some clear- 
ing up. Of the two volumes presented, the first deals 
entirely with Milan, and the second Avith Verona, 
Padua, Bologna, and Ravenna. There appears to 
be a remote kinship with Allen's work on Florence, 
but it is with his scheme rather than his style or 
treatment. The illustrations, including two plates 
in photogravure, consist of reproductions of the art 
and architecture of the region dealt with. 

Mr. Ernest C. Peixotto holds closely to his title, 
" By Italian Seas," throughout the pleasant and 
informing book he has prepared both text and pic- 
tures for. The Riviera di Ponente, Genoa, the 
Riviera di Levante, the Dalmatian coast to Cattaro, 
thence to Naples, and so on to Sicily and Malta, are 
included in his itinerary, from which it will be seen 
that he has wandered on and off the beaten track of 
tourists. Interesting in the extreme is the account 
of the marionett'i of Sicily, " almost invariably 
founded upon the same theme — Ariosto's ' Orlando 
Furioso,' " with the air of the age of chivalry most 
carefully preserved and reproduced. Nor is it quite 
reassuring to those engaged in the " elevation " of 
the English-speaking stage to learn that tliese puppet- 
shows, accurately costumed and with tlieir verses 
well rendered, are the habitual recreation of the poor 
in that sunny island. The illustrations are nearly 
four score in number, both full-page plates and 
drawings in the text, and tlie cover bears a striking 
design in gold and colors. 

"How fortunate it is," observes Dr. Eduard 
Strasburger, " that even on the darkest days imagi- 
nation can raise us up above the clouds I " Yet the 
seven journeys in Italy which he commemorates in 
his " Rambles on the Riviera " are so emphatically 
those of a scholar — and first of all a botanist — 
that one's interest in his luxuriously printed and 
illustrated book is primarily scientific. Vast learning 
regarding the history of familiar plants is placed at 
the disposal of the reader, and accuracy is ensured 
by the reproduction in color of nearly every plant 
mentioned. These illustrations, together Avith numer- 
ous vijjnettes of scenes on the Riveria, arc contrib-

oted by Louise Reusch. Printed as they are in the 
text, they present an unusually novel and attractive 
appearance. 

Of an entirely different and more conventional 
sort is the volume bearing the identical title of Dr. 
Strasburger's, just noticed, but written by Mr. Francis 
MUtoun. Its opening scenes are in Provence, whence 
the reader follows the author in his automobile 
joumeyings to Marseilles and Toulon, and it is not 
until near the close that the Riviera and Monaco 
are reached. The book abounds in descriptions of 
natural scenery. One reads that at Cannes '• local 
* professors ' have a busy time of it, in season and 
out, teaching wliat they call the * id tome hritan- 
nique ' and the • argot Americaine.' " One wonders 
just what this latter can be, and if it is taught to the 
British as well as the French. A frontispiece in 
color and numerous full-page wash drawings are 
supplied by Miss Blanche McManus. The binding 
and end-leaves are particularly attractive. 

Miss Meakin's chapters of •• Travels and Studies 
in Russia " have much of the charm that has been 
noticed in the letters of a good woman-correspondent. 
They are somewhat desultory and discursive, but 
iiiey contain nothing uninterestiug, and they cover 
fields ordinai"ily left untouched even in a country so 
voluminously -s^-ritten of as Russia. It would seem 
as if it were an enormous distance, with a great 
climatic difference, from tbe Riviera to the lands of 
the Czar ; yet there is a Russian Riviera too, as Miss 
Meakin shows in her chaptei"S on the Crimea. Few 
of the proWnces of the empire are left untouched, 
and from every one of them comes information con- 
cerning the private lives and industries of the people 
which are ti-uly informing. The volume has numer- 
ous illustrations reproduced from photographs. 

Professor A. V. Williams Jackson's " Persia Past 
and Present " is something more than a book of 
travel, for it contains much that is imjx)rtant to 
AssjTiologists in the way of scholarship, especially 
in regard to the original rock inscriptions at Behistan 
and elsewhere. So many men great in the various 
activities of life lie buried in Persian soU that the 
book abounds in accounts of famous tombs. Saadi. 
Avicenna, and many another ancient and mediaeval 
notability', have their resting-places described and 
pictured here. There is little of impoilance in the 
Shah's domains in the field of scholarship and lit- 
erature which Professor Jackson does not touch, 
and his reproduced photos^plis are numerous and 
attractive. 

Miss Gertrude Adams Fisher did not wander far 
from the haunts of white folk in " A AVoman Alone 
in the Heart of Japan." though she was without a 
companion during the greater part of her journey. 
Her book, however, is more frank and outspoken 
than the books of most men regarding this much 
visited land, and impressions may be obtained from 
it that are hardly to be gained from any other recent 
work. She enjoyed her intercourse with the jxjlite 
islanders, and has only once to complain of discour- 



tesy — when she came upon a country lad unawares 
and he apparently mistook her for an apparition. 
Many of the photographs in the work are as new as 
the matters they illustrate, and the book has sincer- 
ity and candor. 

Cannibalism appears only in the title of Mr. A. 
E. Pratt's " Two Years among New Guinea Canni- 
bals," and the people who figure in its pages seem to 
be mild-mannered and amiable. Now that Africa has 
been practically explored from end to end, New 
Guinea remains the largest unknown tract of land 
on the habitable globe, and it has been ilr. Pratt's 
good fortune to cover portions of territory in the 
Dutch portion of the island previously unknown. 
This was merely incidental to his main purpose as 
a naturalist ; and here, too, he met with marked 
success. One of his Christmas dinners is thus de- 
scribed : 

'' It ■vraa probably one of the queerest that was ever set 
before an esdled Britisher. I left the task of preparing the 
meal entirely to Sam (a native of Ceylon), -who managed 
somehow to procure some waUaby, a piece of bacon, and 
biscuits. Instead of pudding we had a Cinghalese plnm-cake, 
made by Sam's daughter, and a glass of claret rounded off 
the banqnet. We were not very festive." 

This book is fully illustrated ; and here, as else- 
where, the camera has been relied upon for much 
of the description. It is a long journey from the 
old New England of Dr. Hale's youth to the canni- 
bals of Papua, but a common speech binds all the 
books together, and common race-traditions stand 
behind them. Wallace Rice. 



Miscellaneous Holiday Books. 



Among the holiday publications of last season 
Mrs. Edith "Wharton's - Italian Villas and their 
Gardens," with pictures by Mr. Parrish, will be re- 
membered as one of the loveliest and most sumptuous. 
This year a so-called companion volume has been 
issued by the Century Co., having for its subject 
" The Chateaux of Touraine." The text is by Maria 
Hornor Lansdale ; the sixteen coloretl illustrations 
are by Jules Gudrin, and the others, in black and 
tint, over forty in all, are reproduced from photo- 
g^phs of sufficient artistic merit to make their in- 
clusion in so beautiful a volume eminently fitting. 
For the first and perhaps the ultimate appeal of the 
book is the artistic one. The quality of Mr. Gu^rin's 
work is well known, and these drawings, for the 
making of which he took a special trip to France, 
represent him at his best. His object, as is easily 
evident, is to portray unusual aspects of the chateaux 
— to make light and shadow and coloring suggestive 
of the sentiment that is individual to each one. The 
photographs therefore serve to round out the reader's 
impressions, and also to make certain architectural 
effects and details clearer. The book is royal octavo 
in size, printed with red mnning-heads on fine deckel 
edged paper. The binding is of dark gi-een cloth, 
elaborately decorated in gold and colors. The work

[Dec. 1, 



is copiously indexed. Book-lovers, art-lovers, and 
travellers — actual or would-be — through sunny 
France, cannot fail to be delighted with a book 
which, considered from all their several points of 
view, gives complete satisfaction. The writer of the 
text has evidently devoted i)ainstaking study both to 
the chateaux themselves and to the records of their 
history. Her facts are accurate and authoritative, 
and at the same time picturesquely presented. She 
has not, in her conscientious effort to master her 
subject, lost sight of its charm ; she clothes the dry 
bones of her history with flesh and blood, and thereby 
puts her readers under the spell of these romantic 
old castles where were enacted many thrilling dra- 
mas of the most fascinating period of French history. 
She has chosen twelve chateaux for exploitation, 
nine of them actually in Touraine, the others just 
over its border. But, as the preface assures us, we 
need fear no monotony either in description or his- 
torical association, since each of the twelve is as 
different as possible from the other eleven. Chinon 
is a ruin, haunted by splendid memories of the Maid 
of Orleans and a score of kings. Azay-le-Rideau is 
an exquisitely dainty exam2)le of French renaissance 
architecture, standing serenely amidst its fine old 
trees, its brilliant flower-beds, and its lily-fringed 
ponds, whose still waters reflect its stately towers 
and pinnacles. Langeais is a feudal castle at its 
best, " armed cap-k-pie as on the day when it gave 
refuge to the breathless little Bretonne Duchess rid- 
ing to her hurried nuptials with the king of France." 
In like manner the impression made by each of the 
twelve is unique. Together they are representative 
of one of the most fascinating but necessarily least 
accessible aspects of old-time France. 

With appetite whetted by a glimpse at the 
Touraine book just described, a critic is not in- 
clined to quarrel with the fate that has led other 
authors and artists to the same fair country for ma- 
terial. " Castles and Chateaux of Old Touraine and 
the Loire Country" is published by Messrs. L. C. 
Page and Co. Mr. Francis Miltoun, author of a 
long series of books of travel issued by the same 
house, is responsible for the text, and his artistic col- 
laborator is Miss Blanche JNIcManus. Her studies 
of Breton types, and her sketches in wash and color 
of the chateaux and the country-side that environs 
them, while not so pretentious as Mr. Gu^rin's, are 
charming of their kind. The scope of this volume 
is wider than that of the foregoing, and its method 
more nearly that of the guide-book. Readers who, 
fired by Miss Lansdale's enthusiasm, contemplate a 
tour of the region, will find in Mr. Miltoun a guide 
brim-full of information and suggestions for routes 
and itinerary ; while the stay-at-home traveller will 
have no need to complain of dulness or over- 
complicated detail. It is a pity, however, that Mr. 
MUtoun should continue to present his material in 
so disorderly a form. His arrangement lacks both 
method and sequence, and his style has a qualified 
and uncertain ring that is very annoying. 

The tliird and last of the Touraine series is en- 



titled "Touraine and Its Story" (Dent-Dutton). It 
is a handsomely-bound quarto volume, whose artis- 
tic feature is the colored illustrations fm-nished by 
Mr. A. B. Atkinson. There are fifty of these, por- 
traying every aspect of country and vUlage; and 
almost as many smaller black-and-white drawings are 
set in the text. The color-printing is excellent, and 
the artist's choice and handling of material are at once 
beautifully suggestive and tlioroughly in harmony 
Avith the point of view of the text. This has been 
prepared by Miss Anne Macdonnell, and in no per- 
functory spirit. Miss Macdonnell loves the chateaux 
of Touraine so well that she does not limit herself to 
the usual round of a dozen or so of the most typical 
and imposing. Indeed, she finds more of the flavor 
of by-gone days in the lesser-known castles, where 
there are no guides to hurry the visitor, and where the 
shabbiness and quiet decay give the imagination free 
rein. It is to these that she takes her readers ; to 
the grim fortresses, also, that guarded the lands ; to 
the humble dwellings that nestled in the shadow of 
the lordly manors ; and to the rivers — shy and silent 
or swift and rapacious — that water this "Garden 
of France." We wish that, with her taste for the 
pleasant by-ways of travel, and with the gift, besides, 
to make others see and enjoy what she has seen, 
Miss Macdonnell had devoted herself to the present- 
day aspects of Touraine rather than to its glorious 
past. She relates history and legend very well, but 
she describes even better ; and the art of good de- 
scription is rare. More than half the text is devoted 
to the chronological story of Tours and its neighbor- 
hood. The remaining chapters take the reader to 
various chateaux and churches, often leading him 
from one architectural monimient to the next, along 
the banks of a quiet stream. Thus her history sys- 
tematizes and rounds out the story of the twelve indi- 
vidual chateaux, as told by Miss Lansdale, and her 
itineraries sometimes duplicate but often supplement 
the other writers. The tliree books, each with its 
own purpose and point of view, are alike in the in- 
spiration they furnish for a visit to a region as rich 
in historical association as it is picturesque and beau- 
tifiU in landscaj)e featm'es. 

Those who remember Miss Blanche Elizabeth 
Wade's last year's book, " A Garden in Pink," will 
be glad to know that her new one, " The Stained 
Glass Lady" (McClurg & Co.). is written in the 
same happy vein. The thread of the story is very 
slight ; it relates the progi-ess of a friendship be- 
tween the Stained Glass Lady and the little boy 
who, seeing her first in church, noticed her resem- 
blance to a figiu'e in the window near which she sat, 
named her according y,and kept awake during a long 
sermon to wonder hoAv she would look in a halo in- 
stead of the white hat she was wearing. The quaint 
plays that the lady devised for her little friend after 
the two had become acquainted, the stories she told 
him, the talks they liad together, and the delightful 
ways she found for teaching him the things that 
shy and imaginative little boys need to learn, make 
up the substance of the story. But a bare account

of these facts does the book scant justice. A vivid 
descriptive touch, a whimsical humor, and a highly 
imaginative appreciation of nature combine to pro- 
dace a unique and decided charm, which a slight 
affectation of style rather increases than diminishes. 
Miss Blanche Ostertag furnishes a frontispiece, cover 
vignette, and end-pages, all of which are conceived 
and colored in the quaint style suggested by the title. 
Miss Ostertag is also responsible for the pretty and 
appropriate page-borders. 

Ten years ago !Mr. H. M. Brock made a set of 
pen-and-ink illustrations for a volume of Thackeray's 
** Ballads and Songs ": and in spite of all the good 
work that he has given us since, he has never done 
anything better tlian those drawings. It is a happy 
thought on the part of Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons 
to give these charming pictui-es a decennial revival 
by issuing a new edition of the " Ballads and Songs " 
in a prettily decorated but substantial binding. This 
last precaution is well taken, for here is a holiday 
volume tliat is sure to be well thumbed and long 
cherished by its fortunate possessors. It is unne- 
cessary- to say anj'thing about the delightfully spon- 
taneous humor of Thackei-ay's verses. As for Mr. 
Brock's drawings, they are, like all his illustrations, 
really interpretative ; for Mr. Brock is one of a few 
popular modem illustrators who, knowing their own 
best vein, ai'e content to keep well within it. There- 
fore his smallest taU-piece lias a meaning quite be- 
yond its office in filling up a blank space, and the 
most thoughtful reader finds a new interest and 
suggestiveness in pages that are punctuated by his 
happily conceived and daintily executed vignettes. 
There are more than a hundred illustrations, large 
and small, for the seventy-odd ballads and poems, 
besides headings for the tables of contents and of 
illustrations, and la^^sh incidental decorations. This 
is one of the really choice illustrated books of the 
year. 

" Famous Actor Families in America " (Crowell) 
is a volume of biographical studies written by Mr. 
Montrose J. Moses and first printed in the *' Theatre 
Magazine." Like that of the great orator, the speU 
cast by the great actor can live after him only as a 
vague tradition : but his character and personality-, 
his artistic career, the story of his great triumpl^, 
and some account of his peculiar methods, are all 
legitimate subjects of research and interest, tending 
to create a respect for the past of the stage that 
should have a good influence upon its present eleva- 
tion. Mr. Moses's studies are preceded by gene- 
alogical tables showing the relationships between the 
various actors of each family. Each actor member 
is accorded brief mention, but the main part of the 
sketch is in most cases devoted to the one great 
actor — e.g.. Edwin Booth, our Joseph Jefferson, 
ISIrs. John Drew, Tyrone Power the elder, or George 
Holland — whose work is, so to speak, the centre 
of the family's theatrical interest and activity. Mr. 
Moses has taken great pains to collect and verifj- 
his material; he has been given unusual opportimi- 
ties both to inspect rare manuscript and to reprint 



rare and interesting photographs, and be shows in 
his choice of subjects an excellent sense of propor- 
tion. An introductory chapter gives a desultory 
but entertaining account of the early days of the 
American theatre, and the various biographies throw 
a good deal of light upon the development of our 
stage, besides relating many interesting traditions 
of the older London play-houses. The book is 
attractively printed in two colors, with forty full- 
page illustrations. 

Another book which, probably to the surprise of 
most readers, proves to be largely about actors, is 
]yir. Gustav Kobb^'s " Famous American Songs " 
(Crowell). The songs of which l^Ir. Kobb^ writes 
are the old-time popular favorites like "Home, Sweet 
Home," "Dixie," "Ben Bolt," and "Old Folks at 
Home," with various patriotic and national songs. 
And it is astonishing to find that most of these, like 
most of the populai" airs of the present day, were 
written for the stage, often by men who combined 
the professions of acting and of writing or adapting 
plays. The chief difference between these early song- 
writers and their followers seems to be that most of 
the former sold their wares for a paltry sum, and 
often neglected even to sign their work ; which is 
in striking contrast with the methods of the pros- 
perous song-writers of to-day. The accounts of the 
composition of the words and music of each song in 
Mr. Kobb^'s collection are supplemented by sketches 
of their authors' lives. Photographs of the song- 
writers and of their homes, of famous singers who 
helped to immortalize them, and of autograph copies 
of several songs, serve to illustrate the book, which 
is tastefully printed and bound. 

The new volume in Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons' 
series, collectively entitled "The Great Waterways 
of America," deals with the Ohio River, which the 
subtitle aptly characterizes as '• a Course of Empire." 
Its author is Mr. Archer Butler Hulbert, associate 
professor of American history at Marietta College, 
secretarj- of the Ohio Valley Historical Association, 
and author of several notable historical works. He 
acknowle<lges especial indebtedness, in the prepara- 
tion of the present volume, to the splendid collection 
of Americana recently presented to Marietta Col- 
lege, which includes many clippings of tinique in- 
terest. The illustrations, which are muuerous, are 
from photographs, old prints, maps, and paintings, 
and are a distinct contribution to the value of the 
book. Mr. Hulbert brings to his work unusual quali- 
fications, for he unites a local interest and pride in 
the region of which he writes, with a large pers}>ec- 
tive. and accuracy and perseverance in research with 
a picturesque and pungent stj'le. The Age of the 
Canoe, the Flatlx)at, and the Steamer, as he names 
the divisions of the Ohio's history, are each treated 
fully and entertainingly, in a fashion to vi^•ify the 
heroes of each period from La Salle, Boone, and the 
Clarks. to St. Clair, " Mad Anthony " Wayne, and 
the rest of the Indian fighters, who in their turn 
were supplanted by the heterogenous multitude of 
pioneers. Here not indi%-iduals but pei-sonal tj-pes

stand out in bold relief : conscienceless land-jobbers, 
honest surveyors, '' promoters," and the rough crowd 
of flat-boat men, sailors, and beachcombers who 
formed altogether " as unique a hmnan element as 
can be found in all AVestern history." Thi-oughout 
is emphasized the great drama of conquest and ex- 
pansion in which, often unconsciously, all the varying 
company were actors. Among the lighter and more 
evanescent sort of holiday books, this study of the 
Ohio River has no place ; it will nevertheless prove 
a welcome gift to many persons who would care 
nothing for the more conventional variety of gift 
book. 

The handsome volume entitled " American Coun- 
try Homes and their Gardens " is calculated to im- 
press its readers with the fact that England is not 
the only country where people live a long way from 
their front gates. It is a folio of over two hundred 
pages, whose plates exhibit the best features of nearly 
fifty American country-places, scattered from Maine 
to California and from Massachusetts to North 
Carolina. The owners' and architects' names are 
generally given, and a plan of the estate often sup- 
plements the pictures of its most attractive aspects. 
All the houses are of the more pretentious kind of 
country-seat, such as " Blair Eyrie " at Bar Harbor 
and " Biltmore " at Asheville ; but they are artistic 
rather than showy, and prospective builders may get 
many hints from the book, even though they may be 
working on a much smaller and less ambitious scale. 
The only text is a brief and very suggestive introduc- 
tion by Mr. Donn Barber, who packs into three 
pages a tremendous amount of information about 
the status and development of American architectm-e 
and landscape gardening, and puts the reader in the 
way of appreciating and profiting by the pictures. 
The book is edited by Mr. John Cordis Baker and 
published by the John C. Winston Co. The press- 
work is excellent, and the decorated linen binding 
both substantial and attractive. 

Whittier's " Snow-Bound," a classic American 
poem if there is one, has been many times illus- 
trated, but a new pictorial edition of it needs no 
apology when it is as beautiful as the one issued 
this season by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
Drawings by Messrs. Howard Pyle, John J. Enne- 
king, and E. H. Garrett ; a number of photographs, 
the work of Mr. Herbert W. Gleason and others ; 
and floral decorations for cover and pages by Mr. 
Adrian J. lorio, combine with superior printing to 
make a book of unusual artistic charm and merit. 

Another American classic to receive the tribute 
of tasteful illustration this year is Longfellow's 
" Song of Hiawatha." This is issued by the Bobbs- 
Merrill Co. in large octavo, with pictures by Mr. 
Harrison Fisher and decorations by Mr. E. Stetson 
Crawford. The latter take the form of symbolic 
designs printed in pale green underneath the text, 
and giving an odd but pretty appearance to the pages 
without rendering them in the least illegible. One 
opens the volume with some distrust of Mr. Fisher's 
ability to depict Indian character and legend ; we 



have come to associate him rather with the charms 
of the modern girl and her train of handsome and 
well-tailored admirers. But examination of the 
Hiawatha illustrations reveals an unexpected vein 
of mysticism and poetic sentiment, combined with 
a strong dramatic quality that is also new. Mr. 
Fisher's Indian faces would perhaps be hard to 
duplicate on a reservation, — but neither do Long- 
fellow's Indians live in the commonplace humdrum 
world of reality : so there is no lack of sympathy 
between pictures and text. There is one full-page 
drawing, usually printed in colors, for each of the 
parts of the poem, and two smaller ones, which are 
equally suggestive and spirited. Altogether the 
new edition of "Hiawatha" is as pretty a gift-book 
as one could wish. 

We have long wonderetl how it is ])ossible to pi'o- 
duce j)ublications so luxurious in make-up and at the 
same time so inexpensive as the " special numbers " 
issued from time to time by " The International 
Studio" (John Lane Co.). Nearly every modern 
process of reproduction is laid under lavish contri- 
bution in the pictorial equi})ment of these volumes, 
while in tyjwgi-aphy, paper, and presswork they put 
to shame many art publications issued at several 
times their cost. The two latest numbers have for 
their subjects "The Art Revival in Austria" and 
"Old English Country Cottages." The text of the 
former consists of fom* essays, by different hands, 
dealing with this interesting movement in its various 
phases of art, architectxire, and decorative art. There 
are over two hundred fine illustrations, many in pho- 
togi'avure and color. — The book of " Old English 
Country Cottages " is an attempt to preserve some 
record of these antique buildings that form one of 
the chief charms of rural England. They are dealt 
with in the text by counties ; and while no attempt 
has been made to cover the subject thorouglily, a 
most interesting general outline has been achieved. 
Some 135 pen-and-ink drawings by Mr. Sidney R. 
Jones, depicting general views and architectural 
detail with charm and marked artistic skill, are 
scattered through the text ; and in addition there are 
fifteen beautiful full-page plates in color, after 
paintings by Mrs. Allingliam and others. Both of 
these volumes appear under the editorial direction 
of Mr. Charles Holme, and doubtless it is to his fine 
taste that their excellence is due. Choicer gifts for 
an art-loving friend, at so modest a price, could not 
be found. 

"Rosemary in Search of a Father" (McClure- 
Phillips) belongs to the class of light and anmsing 
novelettes which seem to be sufficiently popular 
nowadays to engage the attention of more than one 
of our cleverest writers of fiction. Rosemary, with 
her pathetic insight into the affairs of her elders and 
her no less pathetic eagerness to set them right, is 
as charming a little person as has lately appeared 
in the world of fiction. The Angel, the Fairy Fa- 
ther, and the Cockney nurse-maid Jane, are all 
delightful, while the Rose Girl adds a spice of adven- 
ture to the tale, and the inevitable motor-car lends

THE DIAL

a characteristic touch to the plot. Six charming 
illustrations by Mr. William Hatherell, some tasteful 
decorations, and a gay cover, combine with the charm 
of the storj- to make this an eminently pretty and 
suitable Christmas gift-book. 

Another book of the same type is •' A Maid in 
Arcady " ( Lippincott), written by ^Ir. Ralph Henry 
Barbour, whose •• Kitty of the Roses " and •' An 
Orchard Princess " many readers will remember 
with pleasure. The new story is longer and some- 
what more substantial than its predecessors, but 
equally graceful and amusing. The hero is a brief- 
less but ambitious young barrister oflf on a holiday 
with his motor-car. which, by opportunely breaking 
down, puts its owner in the way of discovering 
Arcady and its presiding genius. The Maid is both 
elusive and mysterious, as well as being, according 
to her own account at least, a very designing young 
person. But everything ends happily, and the two 
retire to Arcady, where, presumably, they live hap- 
pily for ever after. Mr. F. J. von Rapp's colored 
pictures of the Maid, the hero, and their haunts, are 
unusually soft in coloring and careful in finish. Par- 
ticularly pretty are the little sketches which are 
occasionally, but not so often as to grow monotonous, 
Wgnetted into the generous margins. The cover is 
pretty and unique. 

Of the many delightful Christmas stories of 
Charles Dickens, none is fidler of the joyous aban- 
donment to the good cheer that Christmas brings 
than his account of the Pickwick Club's holiday fes- 
tivities at the Manor farm. Remembering that the 
•• Pickwick Papers " were originally published in 
monthly instalments, the Baker & Taylor Co. have 
felt justified in printing the Christmas chapters by 
themselves in a handsomely bound and lavishly 
illustrated holiday volume. Mr. George ^VJfred 
Williams, who last year furnished the pictures for 
another Dickens Christmas book, contributes an in- 
teresting preface in support of his theory that the 
time has come when a realistic combination of the 
serious and the comic may fitly replace the extrava- 
gant caricature that was the only humorous style 
known to Dickens's original illustrators. Ten full- 
page plates, several of them in color, and a number 
of small line-<li-awings, present the Pickwickians 
and their friends, as well as the goblins of Mr. 
WartUe's tale, in spirited and felicitous fashion. 
If the older generation clings to the Pickwick Club 
that it remembers, younger readers, who are often 
repelled by the coarse humor of Leech and " Phiz," 
will undoubtedly prefer Mr. Williams's gentler 
methotls and more pleasing effects. 

A "Thin Paper" edition of classic poetry has 
been launched by Messrs. Thomas Y. CroweU & Co. 
with eight volumes, containing respectively the com- 
plete poems of Burns. Keats, Shelley, Scott, Long- 
fellow, and Whittier. and a selection from the work 
of Browning. Each volume is provided with an 
introduction, generally in the form of a biographical 
sketch, with a few notes, and in some cases with an 
index to fii-st lines: and each has a photogravure 



portrait of the author, rubricated titie-page, deco- 
rated end-papers, and a silk marker. All are printed 
in fair-sized type on verj- thin paper, of good quality, 
and are uniformly bound in calf -finished limp ieather 
with gold stamping. The small size and dainty fin- 
ish of the edition will appeal to a large class of holi- 
day shoppers in search of a good and inexpensive 
book with a Christmas air about it. — Issued by the 
same publishers, and similarly bound, printed, and 
embellished, except that the frontispieces are not 
authors' portraits, are the •' Thin Paper Two Volume 
Sets," of which five tides have so far been pub- 
lished, — " The Count of ^lonte Cristo," •• Don 
Quixote," '• Les Miserables," Boswell's " Life of 
Johnson," and Carlyle's " French Revolution." Each 
of these works is ordinarily issued in from two to 
five good-sized volumes ; whereas in the thin paper 
edition they take up, box and all, no more room on 
the shelves or in a travelling-bag than the ordinary- 
novel. Yet the tj-pe is of good size and the print clear. 

Ever since the days of -^Isop and Reynard the 
Fox, the humorist, whether author or artist, has 
found an inexhaustible source of inspiration in the 
comic correspondences between the human and the 
animal world. Mr. E. Warde BlaisdeU's animal 
drawings are conceived in the spirit of the fabulist ; 
that is. the satiric purpose is always evident, and his 
beasts, despite their fur and feathers, are more than 
half human. The new collection of Mr. BlaisdeU's 
drawings, entitled " Animal Serials " and published 
by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co., is large octavo size, 
with appropriately humorous decorations on cover 
and end-papers. The serials are pictoriaL with just 
a word of running comment. They depict the foibles 
and fancies of Mr. and Mrs. Rabbit, Miss Hippo- 
potamus, Colonel Lion, and the other beasts, in such 
telling fashion that it will be a faultless reader indeed 
whose pet failing is not satirized somewhere in the 
breezy pages of the book. — Mr. BlaisdeU's pictures 
are also a feature of Mr. Burges Johnson's •• Beastly 
Rh\-mes," which seem even funnier nowthan they did 
when they appeared without pictures in '•Harj>er's 
Monthly." ^Ir. BlaisdeU shows his versatUitj- by his 
pleasing delineations of the Kinkajue, the Aoudad, 
Gnu, and the Okap^. which are quite as satisfactory 
as his soulful drawings of the Glad Young Chamois, 
the Large Oyster, the Fireside Elephant, and other 
fairly familiar beasts. Mr. Johnson's animal verses 
are as amusing in their way as his "Rhymes of 
Littie Boj's " were in another fashion. The obvious 
comparison, which is not at aU to Mr. Johnson's dis- 
advantage, is with 3Ir. Gelett Burgess, who furnishes 
a characteristic rhyme by way of introduction. — 
Mr. Frank Ver Beck's •• Book of Bears "(Lippincott) 
is chiefly pictorial in its appeal, for the comment in 
verse and prose is not half so teUing as the Ulustrations 
which it accompanies. The volimie is dedicated to 
the '' poetical, fantastic, idealistic painter of animals, 
F, S. Church," with whose work Mr. Yer Beck's has 
a close kinship, though it possesses also a distinct and 
pleasing individuaUtj-.

[Dec. 1, 



" They " has been issued by Messrs. Doubleday, 
Page & Co. It will be recalled that when this story 
first appeared its curious combination of realism and 
mysticism, of flitting ghosts and thundering motor- 
cars, called forth a whirlwind of criticism, ranging 
from unmeasured praise to jeering scorn. Each 
reader had his own theory of the story's meaning, 
which it was the dearest object of his life to force 
upon his friends. Thus, for reasons both intrinsic 
and extrinsic, the little story has been very popular, 
and has been translated into many tongues. Holiday 
buyers will welcome the first illustrated edition of 
it, with a decorated cover and fifteen colored plates 
by Mr. F. H. Townsend, whose pictures are cer- 
tainly ornamental, if they do not go far toward 
elucidating the elusive mysticism of the tale. The 
printing is in large clear type, on one side of each 
page only. 

Full of breezy originality are " The Adventiu'es of 
Joujou " (Lippincott ), as Miss Edith Macvane relates 
them. Joujou is the only daughter of the wealthy but 
bom-geois ])roprietor of Perfumery Poizelle, the shop 
Avith the largest gold sign and the finest crystal 
windows in all the Rue de la Paix. Being but lately 
emancipated from a convent, she finds life at her 
father's Norman chateau higldy diverting and ro- 
mantic. Her efforts to enjoy herself and to mai-ry 
the man she loves — who happens, of course, to be 
her family's bitterest enemy — are ably seconded by 
an American girl who comes to the chateau to visit 
and opportunely falls in love with Joujou's intended 
husband. INIiss Macvane's style is piquant and tell- 
ing, and the story has atmosphere and vivacity. 
Some of the illustrations, which are by Mr. Frank 
Ver Beck, are clever, but the color printing is poor. 
The book is gaily l)ound and decorated in red. 

One can scarcely imagine more alluring material 
for illustration than is furnished by Mr. George W. 
Cable's " Old Creole Days," or a more distin- 
guished and delightful method of utilizing the ma- 
terial than that of Mr. Albert Herter in the new 
illustrated edition recently issued by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. Eight full-page pictures and foiu"- 
teen smaller ones are beautifully reproduced in 
photogi'avure. The mechanical features are all of 
a high grade of excellence, and the volume has an 
air of dignity and beauty that well fits the charm 
of the contents. 

*' A Japanese Blossom" (Harper) is the title of 
Onoto Watanna's new book, which, like the others 
that have preceded it, is a simple and yet dramatic 
little story of life in old Japan, with the inevitable 
complication produced by an incongrvious American 
lover or husband. But while the situation may be 
tragic enough for a while. Miss Watanna always 
brings it to a happy ending, even when it involves, 
as it does in " A Japanese Blossom," the horrors of 
war and the necessity of reconciling a family of 
little Japs to the strange ways of an American step- 
mother. The style of this publication is similar to 
that adopted for Miss Watanna's other books — a 
dainty floral cover design, tinted page-borders sug- 



gestive of the oriental setting, and several illustra- 
tions in color. 

Readei-s, old and young, seem never to tire of 
Mr. James Whitcomb Riley's child-verses. This 
year the Bobbs-Merrill Co. publish a delightful 
holiday edition of " When the Heart Beats Young," 
a title that includes all the best of INIr. Riley's child- 
verses, with many pictures in color by Ethel 
Franklin Betts. The little folk of this artist are 
merry, red-cheeked country boys and girls, who 
wear pinafores and "jumpers," torn straw hats and 
gingham sun-bonnets, and whose hands and feet are 
evidently quite as active as their imaginations. The 
pictures are pretty and appropriate, and fully within 
the comprehension of child readers. The mechan- 
ical features of the volume are excellent, with the 
exception of one very patent error in the printing 
of the title-poem. 

Every year Mrs. Blanche McManus Mansfield's 
designs for the leather covers of the little "Thumb- 
Nail Series" (Century Co.) grow more artistic and 
satisfying, and every year the editors of the series 
hit upon exactly the right sort of thing to be re- 
printed in miniature volumes. This time their choice 
has fallen upon Emerson's Essays on " Friendship " 
and " Character," which are prefaced by Miss Emma 
Lazarus's appreciation of Emerson's personality; 
upon Dr. Edward Everett Hale's "The Man without 
a Country," with Dr. Hale's introduction written in 
the year of our war with Spain and his preface to 
the edition of 1897 ; and upon '' The Proverbs of 
Solomon," which are introduced by the illuminating 
chapter on '' The Proverbs of the Hebrews " from 
Dr. Lyman Abbott's "The Life and Literatm-e of the 
Ancient Hebrews." It would be hard to imagine a 
more suitable gift for a fastidious book-lover than 
one of these dainty little reprints. 

In her preface to " Fairest Girlhood " (Revell), 
Mrs. Margaret Sangster apologizes for adding to 
the multitude of books written especially for girls 
by explaining that she knows so many of them all 
over the world, and is so intimately acquainted with 
all their hopes and ambitions that she is, as it were, 
especially privileged to write for them. " Fairest 
Girlhood " is made up of a series of essays, aptly 
named and entertainingly written, dealing with many 
of the problems that beset the modern girl, — from 
what to wear and what to say, to the larger issues 
of health, happiness, education, and the choice of a 
vocation in life. Mrs. Sangster is a modern woman, 
and therefore has a strong sympathy for the modern 
girl and a real understanding of her needs and 
aspirations as well as of her possible limitations. 
The cover of this volume is especially pretty, and so 
are the drawings of various types of girlhood, by 
Griselda Marshall McClure. 

Of whimsical booklets, meant merely for the diver- 
sion of an idle hour, the season has produced its 
full quota. Quite the cleverest that has come to 
our notice is Mr. Oliver Herford's " Little Book of 
Bores" (Scribner). Mr. Herford has discovered 
twenty-four species of Bores, one for each letter of 



1906.]

the alphabet. His rhymes and pictui-es — for !Mr. 
Herford is as usual his own artist — are inimitable. 
One may be assured of finding all his enemies and 
most of his friends among the Bores — and jxjssibly 
he may discover himself there. — " The Altogether 
New Cynic's Calendar for 1907 " ( Paul Elder & Co.) 
appears in its familiar dress of checked gingham, 
and is compiled and decorated, as usual, by ]^Irs. 
Ethel Watts-Mumf ord Grant, Mr. Oliver Herford, and 
Mr. Addison C. Mizner. On the whole, the twisted 
proverbs seem hardly as clever as usual, which is 
perhaps natural considering the di'ain that several 
previous years has made upon the collaborators. It 
is a pity that one vulgar illustration has been allowed 
to disfigure an otherwise amusing little book. — 
Similar in conception to the " Cynic's Calendar " is 
"A Cheerful Year Book" (Henry Holt & Co.), 
with verses and aphorisms by i\Ir. F. M. Knowles, 
pictures by Mr. C. F. Lester, and a prologue and 
epilogue by MLss Carolyn Wells. Besides contrib- 
uting to the gaiety of its readers, this book fm-nishes 
three or fom" lines wherein they may record the 
doings of each day, inspired to cheerfulness in the 
recital by the illustrated motto on the page opposite. 
It is not too much to say that anyone with a sense 
of humor will enjoy the '• Cheerful Year Book " ; 
its jests are merry without being in the least vulgar. 

— " Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy " (Caldwell) is a 
collection, made by Mr. John Bain, Jr., of the prose 
and poetry of cigarette smoking. " The How and 
Where of Them, " " Puffs of Poetry," "Facts and 
Fancies," " Rings Blown in Rhyme," and " My 
Lady and the Cigarette." are the titles of the five 
sections under which the material is grouped. The 
ardent defense of the cigarette, and its glorification 
in lighter vein, will please its devotees. The make- 
up of the book Ls attractive " Knick-Knacks," 

from the press of the Penn Publishing Co., is a 
compilation of amusing anecdotes, for which, — so 
Mr. Coggins, the compiler, assures us, — he has 
raked, pii-ate-fashion, every craft sighted on journal- 
istic seas. Alternate pages of the book contain illus- 
trations of the anecdotes, by Clare Victor Dwiggins. 

— From the same publishers comes " Wise and 
Otherwise," another collection of anewlotes and 
bon mots, which have been compiled by Mr. W. M. 
Rhoads and illustrated by iVIr. A. R. Bowker. The 
imique feature of the book is its flexible leather 
•cover, which, in shape as well as in decoration, simu- 
lates an owl. — "The Book of Spice," by *' Ginger," 
( John W. Luce & Co. ) is aptly described on its title- 
page as " a work recommended to Sufferers who are 
tired of dipping their Daily Bread in the ]MiIk of 
Human Kindness, and whose diet recjuires a Dash 
of High Seasoning; Recklessly Ulusti-a ted." "Gin- 
ger's " humor is naturally of an exuberant, not too 
carefully pruned or assorted type : but at its best it 
is really spicy. The " reckless " iUusti-ations are very 
funny, and the style of binding is unique. 

Daintily bound in blue and gold, with marginal 
dj-awings to match, and nine tinted illustrations, 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg«feCo.'s new illustrated edition 



of Max Mailer's " Memories," in Mr. Upton's grace- 
ful translation, is indeed an elegant and tasteful re- 
print The pictures and decorations are by Misses 
Margaret and Helen Maitland Armstrong, whose 
artistic work needs, at this time, no introduction. 
Thus adorned and beautified, this quaint idyl, with 
its interesting old-world setting and its universal 
pathos, is notable among the choicer gift-books of 
the season. 

" Colonel Crockett's Co-operative Christmas " 
(George W. Jacobs & Co.) is a holiday novelette 
of the conventional type, varied in this case by the 
introduction of rather more novelty and less prob- 
ability than are customary in similar narratives. 
Mr. Rupert Hughes is its author. Holly sprays on 
the cover, Christmas trees and Christmas puddings 
on the end-p)apers, two or three tinted illustrations, 
and pen-and-ink sketches in the wide margins, give 
an appropriate air of festivity to the little book.

[Dec. 1, 



A new edition of Dr. David Murray's volume on 
" Japan," in " The Story of the Nations " series, with 
supplementary chapters by Baron Kentaro Kaneko, is 
now published by the Messrs. Putnam. 

" A Priced Lincoln Bibliography," compiled and pri- 
vately published in a limited edition by Mr. William 
H. Smith, Jr., New York, includes nearly twelve hun- 
dred items, alphabetically arranged by authors, with the 
prices that they have brought at auction. 

M. F. de Martens, the eminent authority upon inter- 
national law, publishes (Paris: Charles-La vauzelle) a 
brochure entitled " Par la Justice vers la Paix," dealing 
with the general problem of South American politics, 
and more particularly with the Drago doctrine. 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis's three farces, entitled 
respectively "The Dictator," "The Galloper," and 
" Miss Civilization," are now collected into a single vol- 
ume, illustrated by photographs of actors and scenes, 
and published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

A text-book of " Rhetoric and English Composition," 
by Professor George Rice Carpenter, is published by 
the Macmillan Co., and adds one more to the lengthen- 
ing list of excellent manuals for the teachers' use. It 
is based, in substance, upon an earlier work of the 
author. 

" Everyday Ethics," by Miss YAla, Lyman Cabot, is a 
book intended for schoolroom use, and appears to be 
an unusually sensible work of its kind. It is a book 
that any child might read with profit if it were not 
forced upon him in the form of " lessons." Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers. 

Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co. publish a second 
edition of " The Bravest Deed I Ever Saw," being a col- 
lection of personal experiences by many writers, edited 
by Mr. Alfred H. Miles. Among the contributors are 
Lord Roberts, Admiral Dewey, the Hon. Winston 
Churchill, Mr. Rider Haggard, and Mr. Frederick 
Villiers. 

" The Value of Love " is an anthology of brief pas- 
sages in verse and prose, prepared by the late Frederic 
Lawrence Knowles, and now offered to the public under 
the sponsorship of Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, who 
supplies it with an introduction memorial of its com- 
piler. The volume is a tasteful example of holiday 
book-making, published by the H. M. Caldwell Co. 

Mr. Swinburne's " William Blake : A Critical Essay " 
was published forty years ago, and has long been out 
of print. He has at last sanctioned a new edition (or 
rather a reprint, for no changes are noted), and of this 
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the American publishers. 
It is a very welcome book, and all the more so because 
it comes at a time when there are many indications of a 
renewed in erest in Blake. 

Richard Hildreth's " Japan as It Was and Is," a semi- 
classic of a half-century ago, is still held in such esteem 
that Mr. Ernest W. Clement has thought it deserving 
of a new edition. This he has prepared, with many 
supplementary notes, and the two volumes of the work 
in its present form are published by Messrs. A. C. Mc- 
Clurg & Co. There are many illustrations, and there is 
also an introduction by Dr. W. E. Griffis. 

Mr. George Roe is the latest of those who, greatly 
daring, have followed after FitzGerald in translating 
Omar Khayyam. His version aims at a middle course 
in satisfying the claims of both letter and spirit. He 
contributes of his own an introduction and many learned 



notes. Marginal references indicate the location of the 
quatrains in other translations. The book is published 
in tasteful guise by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

" A First Book of Poetics," by Miss Martha Hale 
Shackford, is published by Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & 
Co. It is a very small book, and a very elementary 
one, which makes the words on the title-page, " for 
colleges and advanced schools," rather puzzling. A 
child should hardly be permitted to get into college 
without knowing considerably more about the subject 
than may be learned from this primer of poetics. 

Mr. Peter Eckler, New York, publishes a volume 
called " Last Words on Evolution," by Professor Ernst 
Haeckel. It is a translation by Mr. Joseph McCabe, 
of a series of three lectures given by the author in Ber- 
lin, for the special purpose of replying to some of his 
latest theological critics. These lectures were delivered 
a little over a year ago, and it is interesting to note that 
only once before (in 1868^ had the author ever addressed 
a popular audience. 

A selection of the " Podsies Choisies de Alfred de 
Musset," edited by Mr. C. Edmund Delbos, has been 
added to the " Oxford Higher French Series," and is 
HOW published by Mr. Henry Frowde. Other recent 
French texts are Pailleron's " L'Etincelle," edited by 
Professor O. G. Guerlac; Theuriet's "L'Abb^ Daniel," 
edited by Professor Robert L. Taylor; and Moli^re's 
" Le Tartuffe," edited by Professor John E. Matzke. 
All three of these are published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
&Co. 

" Les Cent Meilleurs Pofemes (Lyriques) de la Langue 
Fran(jaise," selected by M. Auguste Dorchain, is a 
pretty little book published by Messrs. George W. 
Jacobs & Co. One must not take a title like this too 
critically ; what the book really gives us is an anthology 
comprising a hundred pieces from Charles d'Orl^ans to 
Heredia and Verlaiue, chosen for the most part with 
judgment, and chronologically arranged. French poetry 
would doubtless offer a hundred others " equally as 
good." 

After an interval of four years, Professor Edward 
G. Browne has published the second volume of his " Lit- 
erary History of Persia." The period covered is from 
the beginning of the eleventh century to the middle of 
the thirteenth — roughly speaking, from Firdawsi to 
Sa'di. This is, of course, the richest period of all, and 
the volume is for that reason more generally interesting 
than its predecessor, although it is so weighted by the 
enormous erudition of the author as to be anything but 
light reading. It is expected that a third volume will 
complete the work. The publication belongs to the 
" Library of Literary History," of which Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons are the American publishers. 

"The "Story of the Rocks and Minerals of Wiscon- 
sin," by Mr. Publius V. Lawson, is sent us by the Post 
Publishing Co., Appleton, Wis. It presents in popular 
form the results of geological surveys of the state, and 
has many illustrations. This is a very useful book for 
educational purposes, and represents a type that we 
wish might be multiplied until a similar work for every 
state and territory in the country should be provided. 
Since the rock-formations of Wisconsin are the most 
archaic in the United States, it is quite proper that they 
should be first to receive such treatment as this. We 
may add that the author has himself done much useful 
work in the geological field, the results of which are here 
incorporated.

KEEPING UP WITH THE MAGAZINES 

without giving^ all one's time to them is a task of ever-increasing 
difficulty. CThis is decidedly the magazine age. The number, 
variety, and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than 
amazing. The master-minds of the world go to their making, — the 
greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month, with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library

The American Journal of Sociology 

A Bimonthly edited by the Sociolofjical Faculty of the University of Chicnpo, with the advice 
of leadinr/ sociologists in America and Europe, ALBION W. SMALL, Editor-in-Chief 

The Only Journal in the English Language Devoted Primarily to Pure Sociology 

$2.00 a year; single copies, 50 cents 

Q OCIOLOGY is a science in the making. It is also a ferment that is ah-eady helping to unmake the 
^ individualistic theories of life which have dominated all moral doctrines for more than a century. 

People who are beginning to take notice that there is something wrong, either in their social 
philosophy or in the facts ; people who suspect that we have not yet found out the whole meaning 
of life, should look into the work of the sociologists. They are not building air-castles. They are 
doing their part toward making real analysis of life more specific, more systematic, and more 
comprehensive. 

This Journal, now in its twelfth volume, is not the organ of a theory of social reform. It 
is a clearing-house for the study of the facts of life according to a certain method. 

This method is examination of the workings of human interests, from their most elementary 
reactions in contacts of two persons, up to their largest combinations as institutions or civilizations. 

During the last century, analysis or abstraction of phases of phenomena has been carried to 
an extreme. The sociological method aims to supplement analysis of social relations with such 
synthesis that social interpretation shall cover the actual experiences of life rather than mere phases 
of life that have no separate existence. 

Subscriptions filed immediately to begin January, 1907, will include the Novem- 
ber, 1906, number free.

A Quarterly; $3.00 a year; 800 pages 



Edited by the Biblical and Divinity Faculties of the University of Chicago 

"PROMINENT in the minds of the men who organized The University of Chicago was the 
-^ idea of publication. To combine the vast amount of printing incident to a university with 
the publication of text-books, monographs, and, especially, journals for the promulgation of the 
results of the research of its own faculties and of investigators throughout the world, seemed an 
ideal well worth attempting to realize. 

That the founders planned wisely the experience of the fourteen years that have elapsed since 
the organization of The University of Chicago Press has amply demonstrated. During this 
period not only has it issued hundreds of books and pamphlets bearing its imprint, but its journals, 
under the editorial management of the various dejiartmental faculties, have everywhere become 
recognized as standard publications in their respective fields and as clearing-houses for the ripest 
scholarship at home and abroad. 

Among these publications, now fourteen in number, there are two tliat may be of special inter- 
est to readers of The Dial : 
I. The Biblical World — a monthly magazine for the spread of interest in and knowledge of 
the Bible. 
II. The American Journal of Theolog^y — a quarterly journal for the scholarly discussion of 
theological and kindred problems. 

A detailed prospectus of each periodical will he furnished on request.

" The narrative is a plain, nnvarnished tale, and if Geronimo had ^vritten as close a biography as 
many men with less interesting lives, he might have provided a book that would have served a

TWO NEW BOOKS 
ON ITALY 

ESPECIALLY ADAPTED, ON ACCOUNT OF 
THEIR BEAUTY, FOR 

HOLIDAY PRESENTATION 





THE COLUMN OF PHOCAS 



Wiitl) %ron tn Stalp 

Being a Selection of the Poems and Letters of Lord Byron which have 
to do with his Life in Italy from 1816 to 1823 

Selected and Arranged by ANNA BENXESON McMAHAN 

Illustrated with over sixty reproductions of views, ruins, statuary, and portraits. 

^ ' T) YROX became Italianized in habits and ideas, entered at once and 
Jj completely into the associations, the hist-ory, the thoughts of the Italian 
people. He was well versed in their great literature, planned to write his own 
masterpiece in Italian, and so often made Italy the subject of his work, that it 
is hardly saying too much to declare that it was through Byron that Englishmen 
first became interested in Italy." — From the Introduction. 

" The letters are all characterized by a dash and piquancy which reveal the author 
as among- the great letter-writers of all time. They contain little comment upon 
Italian scenery or art, but much about the Italian people and their customs. They 
reveal, moreover, the poet's intense love for Italy, which is less generally known or 
appreciated than his devotion to Greece. There are extracts from the longer poems, 
representing Byron's best and most mature work, and which show the extraordinary 
influence of the country upon it. It is altogether a delightful book, either for 
reference or for grift purposes." — TTie Chicago Daily yeu-f.

By GEORGE ELIOT 
Edited, with Introduction and Notes, by DR. GUIDO BL\GI 

Librarian of the Laurentian Library at Florence. 
With one hundred and sixty illustrations of scenes and characters. 

THIS edition of this gfreat classic undoubtedly surpasses in interest all 
others now available. Dr. Biagi. one of the most distinguished scholars 
in Italy, has devoted the past two years to the selection of the iUustrations, 
■which present the historical background in a manner never before attempted. 
They comprise a rare and beautiful jjortrait of George Eliot, f ac-simile pages of 
MSS., reproductions of paintings, wood cuts, portraits, costumes, and illuminated 
manuscripts, as well as photographs of great interest. Nothing has been 
omitted which could throw light on the history of the period covered by this 
great classic, or add to the interest of its reading. The Editor's Introduction 
is scholarly and illuminating.

430 THE DIAL [Dec. 16, 



'T'HE R. R. HAVENS COMPANY announce the purchase of the late Dr. Egle's important 

Library of AMERICANA. This is one of the few original collections still unbroken. Dr. Egle 
was peculiarly successful in securing, during his forty-five years of collecting, many rare items that 
have since become almost unobtainable. The collection is particularly rich in books relating to 
the North and Middle West, Early Pioneer Adventures, such as Pattie's Narrative, Patterson's 
History of the Back Woods, the Original Editions of McClung, Cummings, Snell, Craig, Cutler, 
Flint, Harris, Lewis & Clark, McAfee, etc. 

His collection of books relating to the North American Indian offers to the collector an excep- 
tional opportvmity to secure such treasures as Loudon's Indian Narratives in the original edition. 
This is, by the way, the only complete copy, as far as known, offered for sale since the Field 
collection was sold in 1873. Ben Franklin's own copy of the Lancaster Massacre ; Boquet's 
Expeditions, also the original manuscript of this book in the handwriting of WiUiam Smith, the 
author ; Wither's Border Warfare ; Metcalf 's Narrative ; Beatty's Journal ; Letters on the 
Iroquois, 1752 ; Thompson's Delaware and Shawnee Indians; the original edition of the several 
pamphlets relating to the Paxton Boys ; Doddridge's Notes ; The Remonstrance of the Bleeding 
Frontier Inhabitants of Pennsylvania; Campanius' Catechism in the Language of the Virginia 
(or more correctly the Delaware) Indians, 1696. The Indian Treaty of 1743 printed by 
B. Franklin, also the Treaty with the Six Nations, 1742, and the Treaty of Sir William Johnson, 
1756, and many other early Treaties. Among the more modern books relating to the Indians 
are nearly complete sets of Schoolcraft's Writings, also Brinton, De Smet, Morgan, Squier, Kip, 
Heckewelder, Catlin, Colden, De Hass, McKenny, Henry, etc. 

The Library is very rich m local history, with such items as McCall's Georgia, presentation 
copy ; Haywood's Tennessee, in boards, uncut (both series) ; Thompson's Long Island ; Foote's Vir- 
ginia ; Beverley's Virginia, 1705 ; the original edition of Smith's New York ; Smith's New Jersey ; 
Du Pratz's Louisiana ; Winthrop's New England ; Penn's Account of Pennsylvania, 1686. Among 
the books relating to the American Revolution are: The Original Andre Trial; Andre's Cow 
Chase; Hubley's History, in boards, uncut; Wilkinson's Memoir, with atlas and a four-page 
A. L. S. relating to affairs in the Western Country, 1793; Life of Colonel Greene, with four 
A. L. S. relating to the Revolution. 

The Pennsylvania collection is undoubtedly one of the best obtainable, as it includes almost 
every known local and general history published in book or pamphlet form. 

As a genealogist Dr. Egle needs no introduction, and his collection amply justifies his reputation. 
In this collection are such items as complete sets of the New York Genealogical and Biographical 
Record ; The New England Genealogical Register ; Savage's Dictionary ; and Dr. Egle's own 
copy of Pennsylvania Genealogies, extended and elaborated, with Manuscript additions ; the first 
Genealogical Record printed in America, Ephrata, 1763. 

There is a large collection of books from the Franklin press, including Cato Major, etc. 
The Ephrata imprints include a fine copy of the celebrated Book of Martyrs. The collection 
includes the first (Zionitscher, 1739) and many other issues of the Sauer press. There is an 
tmusual collection of American Broadsides. The files of American Periodicals include full sets 
of The Dial, Magazine of American History, Magazine of Western History, American Notes and 
Queries, Dawson's Historical Magazine, Pennsylvania Magazine of History, etc. Many of the 
books are of more than ordinary interest, containing letters and notes relating to their contents, 
either by the author or some well-known authority, such as Dr. Egle. 

As a whole, we think this to be an exceptional collection. 

As the number of catalogues issued is necessarily limited, we make a nominal charge of fifty 
cents. This amount, however, will be deducted from first order.

"JVJRS. BURNETT'S new serial story, 

* The Shuttle,' in The Century, is 

already making a 'sensation.' Lr/^rhe:;.:: 

to call the ' psychological moment,' if that once useful phrase had not been 
so dreadfully overworked. The * international marriage' — meaning only the 
wedding of a rich American young woman to a foreign nobleman in need of 
money — has lately been a subject of much heated discussion. Mrs. Burnett's 
earlier chapters treat of such a marriage with bitterly cruel results. . . . The 
heroine of ' The Shuttle,' as it developes, will be, not the American girl who has 
been sacrificed, but her younger sister, Bettina. Thus far the movement of the 
story has been swift, and the denotement of character vigorous and interesting."

An UP-TO-DATE ENCYCLOPEDIA of QUOTATIONS 



STOKES' ENCYCLOPEDIA 
of FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS 

Compiled by ELFORD E. TREFFRY 

Since the last appearance of a reliable encyclopedia of familiar quotations many authors then unknown have 
come to be widely quoted, while many quotations then familiar are now known only to the erudite few. 

The cleaning out of ibis dead ijuood and substituting for it the actually familiar quotations of more recent 
ivriters -iXias one of the main ideas in the compilation of this nenu encyclopedia ; the immortal quotations, 
honuet'er, are here given full justice. 

In spite of the omission of obsolete material this encyclopedia contains quotations from over one hundred 
more authors than does the best similar work. This work is more convenient than some older volumes of similar 
character owing to its exhaustive index (giving all the important words of a quotation instead of the first only) 
and to its arrangement by subjects instead of by authors. This will prove of great value to those seeking 
embellishment of essays, speeches, etc.

The American Journal of Sociology 

A BimontMv edited bv tJve Sociological Faculty of the UnivertUv of Chicago, with the advice 
of leading toeiologitt* in America and Europe. ALBION W. SMALL, Editor-in-Chief. 

The Only Joarnal in the English Language Devoted Primarily to Pore Sociology 

S2.00 a year ; single copies. 50 cents. 

THE sociologists are working on the clue that human association — or " the stream of life," as it was 
called a generation ago — is a process, made up of lesser processes, down to the v anishing of social 
relations in movements within the individual consciousness which make the problems of psychology. 

The goal of the sociologists is a statement of life in terms of the ultimate processes which are working 
out through the different incidents of human experience. 

Some of the sociolog^ts prefer to describe their work as a return to the ideal of social study proposed 
bv Adam Smith, but developed by him only in the economic division of human activities. In the philosophy 
of the author of The Wealth of Nations the activities prompted by the wealth interests were merely one of 
several departments of hiunan pursuits. In his scheme, accordingly, economic science was only one of an 
indefinite number of social sciences which must be worked out and correlated in order to furnish an adequate 
chart of actual social processes. For nearly a century the economic fraction of social science was culti- 
vated as though it were the whole. Sociology is not a rival of economics. It is essentially a method of 
investigation, with the aim of making the other social processes as intelligible as the economists have made 
the processes which terminate in the production of wealth. 

This Journal is a medium of publication for both general and special studies of social relations, as 
they appear from this pomt of view.

Edited by the Biblical and Divinity Faculties of the University of Chicago 

THE BIBLICAL WORLD, founded by the late President William R. Harper under the name of The 
Hebrew Student, completes in December, 1906, a quarter-century of history. During this period 
it has been one of the most effective agencies in America for the extension and improvement of the study 
of the Bible, for the introduction of such study into academies and colleges, for the elevation of standards 
of instruction in the Sunday school, for the popularization of the historical method of study, and for the 
development of practical and effective interest in religious education. In the future it will with renewed 
energy devote itself to the same ideals that it has pursued in the past. 



Scholarly, but popular 



Progressive, but reverent 



THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY is more distinctly scientific in character, seeking to 
promote theological scholarship by the publication of papers embodying the results of scholarly 
research; yet deals with living questions of vital and present concern to thinking men. Encouraged by 
the steadily growing appreciation of the service it has rendered, it enters upon its second decade with the 
determination to build strongly on the foundation laid and to become still more efficient in promoting the 
ends for which it was established. 

Scientific, yet vital Critical, yet constructive

While Dr. BiaKBBCK Hill's literary reputation maybe said to be based chiefly on his editions of Boswell's "Life of Johnson," 
Johnson's "Letters," and "The Lives of the Poets," his memory will be treasured longest by his American friends as the author 
of "Harvard College, by an Oxonian," written shortly after his first visit to this country. There were many letters written 
by Dr. HiLL from Cambridge and elsewhere during his two visits to New England on the occasions of his receiving degrees from

THE LOVE-T HEME IN FICTION. 

Enter, woman. Immediately the world begins to 
brighten and bustle and sparkle. Man's Eden with- 
out Eve would be a dirty place, full of tobacco 
smoke. Nay, if it had not been for the urging of 
the ever-womanly he would have been content with 
cocoanuts and a strong tail to swing himself from 
tree to tree. All that man really wants of his own 
accord is to knaw at a great shin of beef, knock some 
other man's brains out with the bone, and then plunge 
into meditation on the What and Why and Where 
of the universe. But his sweet tormentor appears, 
and he has to clean and dress himself and cultivate 
the courtesies of life, and turn his talents to practical 
account in order to furnish her with barbaric wealth 
of gold and gems. 

This essay is predicated on the fact that there is 
some difference between men and women, and that 
the sexes equally acknowledge this and are willing 
to do their duty in the station of life to which it 
has pleased Grod to call them. This view is not 
altogether fashionable to-day. Perhaps it was not 
fashionable in the Athens of old, when Aristophanes 
wrote his Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusm and Tkes- 
mophoriazusce ; or in Alexandria, when Hypatia 
preached rebellion to her girl acolytes. A lost 
tragedy of .^^chylus is foimded on an incident which 
shows that even in mythical times the question of 
woman's place and rights was to the front. The 
story is to the effect that the women of an island in 
the Archipelago rose one night and killed all their 
male relatives to the last child. That was thorough, 
and might be commended to our modern ladies. 
On the other hand, there is a novel by Sir Walter 
Besant called '' The Revolt of Man," which describes 



440 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



a future revolution against the power of women. It 
is well to get these abnormal situations out of the 
way before beginning on our proper study. 

Man's idol-worship of woman springs partly from 
his long years of submission to and reverence for 
his mother, and partly from the instinct for beauty 
which nature has implanted in him. The girl, in 
her grace and charm and softness and modesty, is a 
mystery to him. He is imperiously compelled to 
account her a higher being than himself. Her glance 
inspires him. His tongue is attuned to eloquence 
and wit ; his limbs spring forward for deeds of emu- 
lation or valor. That is the Sacred Love of the 
great painter. In its highest manifestations it be- 
comes the devotion of Dante for Beatrice or Michael 
Angelo for Vittoria. On a lower but still high level 
it is the theme of most of the love poems of the 
world. Mixed with a good deal of Profane Love, 
it is the common stuff out of which domestic life is 
fashioned. The South Sea Islander, having wor- 
shipped his misshapen image of stone or wood for 
a year or so, takes it down, gives it a good thrashing, 
and then sets it back upon its pedestal and worships 
it some more. Men do this, mentally at least, with 
women ; for the need of adoration remains to the end. 

There is a question whether such romantic love 
as I have described is not a comparatively recent 
invention. It certainly does not come out strongly 
in Greek literature, where woman seldom finds her- 
self dominant, except in the case of Helen, whose 
power is attributed to a goddess behind her. But 
the Ramayana, perhaps in its original state one of 
the oldest of human compositions, is the very ecstasy 
of romantic love. The questions of the purity and 
faithfulness of woman, and her consequent influence 
over men, are worked out in this poem as they might 
have been by Shakespeare or Tennyson. And the 
same is true of Kalidasa's Sakuntala, and even of 
" The Toy Cart," though the heroine of this last 
piece is a courtesan. The power of woman to charm 
and inspire and lead man to the heights is probably 
as old as human nature. In the literature of the 
south of Europe — leaving out Dante and Petrarch 
— it is not much in evidence ; while the Scandinar 
vian and Celtic literatures fairly blaze with the glory 
of this power. Siegfried and BrunhUd, Deirdre and 
Naoise, the men and women of the Arthurian le- 
gends, are perfect exponents of romantic love. And 
the supreme poet of the North has given expression 
to a score of varieties of imaginative passion, from 
the tender fooling of Orlando and Rosalind, the 
jealousy and devotion of Posthumus and Imogen, 
up to the blighted adoration of Othello's gi-eat heart. 
Goethe is a good second in painting the overwhelm- 
ing power of good women over strong men. And 
with Wagner, the devotion of woman is the redemp- 
tion of man. 

Sensuousness, as MUton saw, is the very essence 
of poetry. MUton himself, and his master Spenser, 
are perhaps more sensuous in their painting of the 
nude — the nude touched, too, with passion — than 
any other of our poets. There is no doubt they did i 



right. But is sensuality a proper subject for lit- 
erary treatment ? This is the sole meaning of all 
the discussions about morality in art. Nobody 
objects to the use of other evil agencies — envy, 
hatred, murder, theft, and so forth, — in fiction. It 
would be impossible to write a Sunday school 
story of two pages without some bad habit or vice 
in it. But Profane Love, the illicit relations of 
men and women, — is that a fit subject for print ? 
The prints we see the most of — the newspapers — 
are full of it. I do not see why we should prevent 
great artists from using such matter, if they want 
to. In the first place, it is full of power, and crea- 
tive artists will seek power wherever it is to be 
found. In the second place, the Earth-spirit of 
Lust is the foil or complement to the Divine Spirit 
of Love. He keeps the latter from becoming too 
thin and aerial, or too false and pompous, and sets him 
off in true relief. You cannot paint a picture with 
white paint on a white canvas. All colors and 
shadows must enter into the composition of a pic- 
ture of the world. Personally, I prefer the creed 
of Lovelace's lines, 

" I could not love thee, dear, so much, 
Loved I not Honour more," 

to the creed of Browning's poem, "The Statue 
and the Bust." I prefer the girls of Shakespeare 
to the problematic women with an unproblematic 
past who flourish in contemporary plays. But all 
are part of the show of the world, and I do not 
know where to draw the line between Moli^re's 
" School for Wives " and Casanova's Memoirs, be- 
tween Goethe's "Wilhelm Meister" and Balzac's 
Contes Drolatiques, between " Tom Jones " and 
Zola. The very worst of such books soon correct 
themselves by causing a surfeit, and we return with 
greater love to the pure delineations of imaginative 
passion. 

If love is the sun that vivifies the world, friend- 
ship is the moon and all the stars. In Greek lit- 
erature it has practically thrust love out of doors. 
The friendship of Achilles and Patroclus is a nobler 
and more beautiful thing than the love of Paris and 
Helen. Orestes and Pylades are examples of a bet- 
ter feeling than the hot and selfish love of man and 
girl. And the sisterly friendships of Antigone or 
Electra stretch down to us across the years with 
calm and healing charm. What situations there 
are in earth's records of the friendship of men for 
men, of women for women — or of men and women 
for each other ! That circle of orators and poets and 
philosophers around Pericles ; those other circles 
around Augustus, or Louis the Fourteenth, or the 
Duke of Weimer ; Shakespeare's tavern companions; 
Dr. Johnson's club, and a myriad other coteries, — 
how they stand out in the light of Time ! The world 
owes a great part of its good work to the mutual 
admiration and mutual help of friends. Of course 
the modern epic of friendship is "The Three Mus- 
keteers" of Dumas. 

Courtship may be considered as the duel of sex. 
There is probably nothing in the world so proud 



1906]. 



THE DIAL

and self-sufficient as a high-spirited young girl. 
She will patronize the Pope, or pat a pyramid on 
the head. Before she can be brought to surrender, 
tamed to submission, there is verge and scope 
enough for great comedy. Mirabell and MUlamant's 
love-chase in Congreve's "Way of the World," and 
Di Vernon's treatment of her rather loutish lover 
in Scott's novel, are examples. On the other hand, 
Rosalind's wooing of Orlando gives the woman as 
the aggressor; and Mr. Bernard Shaw has developed 
this theme to its full, and rather more than its full, 
extent. 

Desire without requital is a noble theme, albeit 
one that carries with it a slightly ridiculous air. In 
the old-fashioned novels the maiden pines away and 
the lover goes into the army and leads a forlorn 
hope. Michael Angelo's love for Vittoria is an 
instance in real life. Tennyson's " Maud " is per- 
haps the most thorough-going instance in modern 
poetiy. The whole theory of the Troubadour life 
and the later Courts of Love was based on this idea. 

Quarrels, reconciliations, love intrigues, the oppo- 
sition of circumstance, — these are the spice of half 
the fiction of the world. The fact that the course 
of true love never did run smooth is a providential 
enactment for the sake of plot and situation. Few 
plays could get beyond the first act, few novels 
beyond the first chapter, if it were not for this 
quality in the constitution of things. Shakespeare 
pleasantly ridicules the whole matter in •' The Mid- 
summer Night's Dream" with Puck's ironical com- 
ment, "What fools these mortals be I" 

Poe thought that the death of a beautiful and 
beloved woman was the highest theme that poetry 
could attempt. He has expressed it in "The Raven " 
so as to thrill all the world. But this matter prop- 
erly belongs to another study. 

Woman is the joy-giver. A great part of the 
realized happiness of life comes through her. Books 
that end well end in marriage. Yet it is the antici- 
pation of happiness which comes out most in litera- 
ture. Wedding songs are short. I cannot recall any 
play or poem or novel which is one long epithalamium. 
Perhaps they would be dull. 

Woman is the guardian of life. As mother, nurse, 
guide, teacher, she holds a great place in literature. 
Andromache smiles to us across the centuries with 
Astyanax on her lap. Medea is an instance of per- 
verted maternity. Shakespeare is full of mothers — 
the tragic Constance, Lady Macduff, the mother of 
Perdita, Countess Rousillon, and many more. One 
of the most truthfully drawn mothers in fiction is 
Mrs. Pendennis ; and one of the most enchantingly 
portrayed is Lady Castlewood, Esmond's second 
love. Beyond and above all, there is the Mother of 
Christ to whom art and song have done homage for 
two thousand years. 

Woman is the organizer of the social pageant. SKe 
is the principle of cohesion which brings together the 
male atoms that would otherwise fly apart. And 
though without a hundredth part of man's instinct for 
beauty, or his taste and power of conception and exe- 



cution, she compels him to bring all these gifts to her 
service; she makes him build her beautiful houses 
and furnish them fittingly ; she makes him invent 
exquisite fabrics for her to wear, and dig up gems 
wherewith to adorn her. More than this, she turns 
him — man himself, the Orson of woods and caves 

— into an exquisite, into a courtier, into a dandy. 
Osrick and Beau Brummel are her creation ; so are 
the wits and beaux that flourish in a thousand com- 
edies and novels. 

Finally, woman is the maker of home. I hardly 
know whether this can be considered a separate 
theme, though such poems as Goethe's "Hermann and 
Dorothea " and Burns's " Cotter's Saturday Night " 
really express the sentiment of home more than 
anything else. And the same sentiment dominates 
" The Vicar of Wakefield." The home-making in- 
stinct is indeed almost the dominant one in woman. 
She goes about building her nest as inevitably and 
almost as unconsciously as a bird. This instinct 
peeps out of Imogen's action in her brother's cave ; 
it accompanies Deirdre on her flight in Alba ; it sits 
prettily upon Eve in her paradisiacal bower in Milton's 
epic. In a myriad interiors of a mj-riad novels and 
poems, woman sits enthroned the queen of a limited 
but imdisputed domain. 

The best kind of love, as I have tried to show, is 
based upon sacrifice. We bring presents of flowei's 
and fruits to our idols, we offer up burnt sacrifices, 
and finally we yield them our hearts and lives. 
This kind of service can be given to other objects 
than women. We are rooted, almost as trees are, in 
the soil from which we spring ; our frames are built 
out of its elements ; we bear the badge of its clime 
upon our brow. And love of country, patriotism, is 
the natural outcome. Literature is full of this theme. 
In the narrow states of Greece, duty to the state 
was almost the first obligation of life. Antigone is 
refused permission to bury her brother because he 
has sinned against his native land. " The Persians " 
of ^schylus is a chant of triumph for Salamis. 
Virgil's epic was written with the one view of the 
eternal emblazonment of Rome. Shakespeare's En- 
glish histories were inspired by a like purpose — at 
least, many of their most splendid passages breathe 
the fire of passionate love. Walter Scott may almost 
be said to have created Scotland by his intense patri- 
otism. The theme of country love is treated by 
Schiller in his " William Tell " and by Goethe in 
" Egmont." There are innumerable other works in 
which it is the dominant note. 

Love of mankind — philanthropy — is in some 
sense a modei-n feeling. It is of course an ingredient 
in some religions — the Buddhistic and Christian, 

— but national and racial hatreds kept it long in 
check. It really seems to be a special growth of our 
times. Lessing's " Nathan the Wise " is almost the 
earliest docimaent of it. — Rousseau's propaganda 
the most effective one. The final scene of the second 
part of " Faust " is a summing up of philanthropy ; 
Hugo's Xes Miserahles is an immense expression of 
it. Frankly, the sentiment is almost too vague and

vast to be a good theme for fiction. The love of 
fame, of glory, dictating heroism and personal action 
of various kinds, is a better one. Hotspur, impa- 
tient of the hour in which he could not fight, aspir- 
ing to pluck bright honor from the drowned moon ; 
Falconbridge, pushing into the quarrel of kings ; 
Cellini, sacrificing his metal household implements 
to fill out the mould of his Perseus ; Chatterton, 
fighting for fame in his garret, — these are vivid 
and distinct figures of appeal. 

There are various oddities of love which may 
form a sort of comic afterpiece to this study. Such 
are the love of animals pushed to excess, the love of 
bric-a-brac, the collector's mania, and so forth. Squire 
Western probably cared more for his dogs and 
horses than he did for Sophia, and Scott's Antiquary 
certainly loved his black-letter ballads better than 
his niece. There is a delightful French story, " The 
Porcelain Violin," which gives the collector's mania 
to the life. Charles Leonard Moore. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The Atlantic Monthly's fiftieth birthday is an 
occasion for cheer to all who care for what is best and 
highest m our literature. It was in November, 1857, 
that this most distinguished of American magazines, 
under Lowell's editorship and with a staff of contribu- 
tors many of whose names are now famous in literary 
history, made its appearance in Boston, then the un- 
questioned literary and intellectual centre of the 
country. Stanehly true to national and especially New 
England traditions and ideals, without sensational or 
pictorial allurement, and with no very material changes 
in form or character, this modestly but tastefully clad 
monthly has for half a century held to its even and 
dignified course, enjoying a reputation for sanity and 
restraint, for refinement of manner and devotion to what 
sweetens and inspires and elevates, such as no other 
American magazine can claim. Scanning the roll of 
those associated with its honored past, and bearing in 
mind those of a later generation who are now bearing 
onward the torch, we feel that it is not too high praise 
to rank " The Atlantic " by itself, in a class where there 
is none to hold even the second place. Announcements 
for the coming year give warranty that the old excel- 
lence of the magazine will suffer no decline. A special 
feature will be a series of articles by its living ex-editors, 
Mr. Howells, Mr. Aldrich, and Mr. Page, and by a few 
of its earliest contributors, notably Professor Norton, 
Colonel Higginson, and Mr. Trowbridge. Not many 
are left who recall the appearance of the first issue of 
" The Atlantic," with its ruffed portrait of Governor 
Winthrop, and its imprint of Phillips, Sampson & Com- 
pany, on the cover; but these will cherish the memory 
of its honored past, while wishing for it even greater 
good and higher honor for the future.

A RETREAT FOR LITERARY WORKERS and other brain- 
weary and world-weary folk, — a sort of conventual 
settlement of a non-religious kind, — is planned by a 
Swiss gentleman named Bignami. In a circular out- 
lining his project he invites those who feel a craving 
for retirement and isolation, and an opportunity to com- 
mime with their souls in quiet, to join him and others 



like-minded in forming a community, whose exact 
location seems not yet determined. Weariness of the 
struggle and discord and aimless rush of modern life, 
he argues, makes necessary such a retreat, and he hopes 
to gather together a congenial group of tired workers, 
literary men, joiu-naUsts, artists, scientists even, to enjoy 
fraternal intercourse in an atmosphere of tolerance, 
liberty, and friendliest brotherhood. This permanent 
or temporary colony, forming itself into a happy inter- 
national family, may perhaps engage in some artistic or 
Hterary labors, even publish a magazine or books ; but its 
main purpose is to find rest and spiritual refreshment, 
and a Ufe of peace. Experiuients of this sort, though 
often tried and seldom or never successful, will always 
appeal to certain ardent souls who seek some means of 
making life better worth the living than they have found 
it in " the rush, the hum, the shock of men."

Another author of the Shakespeare plays has 
been discovered, and now it is the Shakespeare-Bacon- 
Rutland controversy. A German scholar. Dr. Bleibtreu, 
informs the learned world that the Earl of Rutland 
(1576-1612) — who spent some years in France and 
Italy, studied law at Padua, went on a mission to Den- 
mark in 1603 to represent James I. at the baptism of 
the Danish crown prince, and employed his spare time 
there in getting up the local color for " Hamlet," ac- 
tually meeting Rosencrantz and Guildenstern meanwhile 
— wrote the plays and poems falsely attributed to " the 
low comedian, William Shakespeare, who regularly got 
drunk at the Mermaid Tavern," and who for abundant 
convincing reasons could not possibly have produced the 
works ascribed to him. Should doubt still remain in 
any mind, Dr. Tiu-szinsky, the distinguished German lit- 
erary critic, will dispel it in short order. He declares 
the evidence collected by Dr. Bleibtreu to be irresistible. 
It probably is — to him. And yet, in the face of it all, 
a goodly nmnber of scholars of repute still obstinately 
cling to the Shakespeare heresy.

The ready recognition of literary merit, and tha 
eagerness of editors and publishers to welcome genius 
whencesoever it may hail, is a theory often urged, though 
naturally a little difficult of belief to those whose con- 
tributions are rejected. Some doubter of this class re- 
cently tried the experiment of copying, with changes of 
personal and place names, one of Mr. Kipling's most 
popular stories, and sent it out to ten leading magazines 
of this country, by all of which it was politely declined 
with no indication that the hoax was discovered. Fi- 
nally the very publishers who had originally issued the 
story, after gravely weighing its merits for seven weeks, 
sent the practical joker a letter of acceptance and a 
check. Of course the check was returned and the manu- 
script recovered. One offered explanation of the ten 
rejections is that although the fraud was detected the 
editors were too polite to mention so rude a thing!

JXTDGIXG LITERATURE THROUGH THE NOSE is a method 

applied by a New York reader — a woman. In select- 
ing her books from the library, it is said, she follows her 
sense of smell. A nose for news we have all heard of ; 
a nose for novels and poems and memoirs and histories 
is less common. Only books that smell of tobacco will 
suit this robust feminine reader ; and the stronger the 
nicotine exhalations, the better. A whiff of -musk or vio- 
let or heliotrope wafted to her nostrils would condemn 
a volume at once ; it would mean that the work was 
read only by women, and is not for her. The formula 
is simple : strong odor of tobacco — strong literature ; 
delicate feminine odors — weak namby-pamby stuff. 
Clearly, this woman has once been a girl, and longed to 
do the things and read the books her big brothers did ; 
and now the child is mother of the woman, and she im- 
proves her chance. We once knew a publisher's reader 
who rejected a MS., without even untying the package, 
on the ground of smell — the combined fumes of rank 
tobacco and bad whiskey which it exhaled making too 
obvious the nature of the inspiration under which the 
romance or poem was composed. It was not this literary 
expert's nose, it now appears, but his judgment, that 
wa.s at fault. If the odoriferous work could have been 
issued in all its original flavors, it woidd certainly have 
found favor in the eyes — or rather in the nostrils — of 
this discriminating Xew York reader. But are there 
enough noses like hers to make it worth while for pub- 
lishers to cater to them with their literary wares?

Miss Elizabeth Melville (Fourth Ave. and Eighteenth

Juvenile conservatism in the matter of literary liUngs 
should make the once favorite " Typee," " Omoo," and 
" Moby Dick " still good " sellers " in the book market,

Possibly a life of Melville will do something toward re-

The probable effects of a gexeral cheapening 
OF BOOK-PRICES is an interesting point of discussion in 
the " book war " still raging in London. In urging the 
desirability, even for commercial reasons, of cheaper 
books, the " Times " adduces some interesting facts. 
It appears that in the past year a yoimg London pub- 
lisher, not of the " Trust," secured a novel from each 
of twelve well-known authors (six English and six 
American) and published these books in a style equal 
to that of the ordinary 31.50 novel, but at a retail price 
of fifty cents; and though the profit to all concerned 
was small on each copy, the low price sent the sales up 
to a figure that made the aggpregate gains unusnallv 



large. A still more striking example is cited in the 
enormous sale of " Robert Elsmere " in cheap editions 
issued by a score of American publishers in the days 
before international copyright. The commercial prac- 
ticability of cheap editions of popular books has often 
enough been proved in scattering instances ; but a gen- 
eral great reduction could hardly insure correspond- 
ingly increased sales on all books. There is a limit 
both to the reading appetite and to the fvmd available 
for book-buying. The instances alleged by " The 
Times " might, we suspect, appear less convincing after 
a little scrutiny. The American editions of "Robert 
Elsmere," besides despoiling the author of her rights 
of royalty, were usually issued in such wretched form 
that, although sold for little, it was about all they were 
worth. And the concept of a copyrighted novel issued 
in the style of the ordinary §1.50 novel, yet sold at a 
retail price of fifty cents, may be acceptable to the 
somewhat heated intellects of the " Times " champions, 
but will hardly bear the test of the cold arithmetic 
known to the solvent Book Trade. Cheap paper and 
binding, and authors' pittance, may not cost much, but 

they do eost^something.

To SYNDICATE THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES is a plan nOW 

proposed by Librarian Canfield of Columbia University. 
A scheme of cooperation somewhat after the plan of a 
commercial trust is held to be necessary in order to 
cope with the outpour of books and cover the literary 
field economically and without needless duplication. By 
specialization and a division of labor, the libraries of a 
large citv' could doubtless increase their collective effi- 
ciency; and this plan is already in partial operation in 
Chicago, New York, Boston, Baltimore, and elsewhere. 
But somehow this movement seems impleasantly domi- 
nated by the same spirit that uses in reference to it the 
words " syndicate " and " proposition." Perhaps it is 
not unfortunate that the smaller communities must still 
depend on their one librarj-, which, in an eclectic man- 
ner and within modest limits, wUl continue to aim at 
encyclopaedic comprehensiveness, and whose quiet al- 
coves the " syndicate proposition " has not yet invaded.

Genius for PERVAsn^ENESs in the world of let- 
ters is in a fair way to make Mr. A. C. Benson a for- 
midable rival even to the ubiquitous Mr. Andrew Lang. 
Mr. Benson's emergence from the shelter of anonymity 
to acknowledge the authorship of one successful book 
after another, has prompted " Pimch " to declare him 
responsible for the " Apocalypse," thus settling a dis- 
pute centuries old. " The House of Quiet " (now in its 
tenth edition), which was cordially commended in these 
pages on its first appearance about three years ago, 
"-The Upton Letters," also most favorably noticed by 
hs, and " The Thread of Gold," more recently urged 
upon our readers' attention, are now admitted to equal 
rank and honors with " Walter Pater," " From a Col- 
lege Window," and other of Mr. Benson's signed works. 
Prophetic vision can be cheaply claimed after the flood- 
tide of popular approval has set in; but it is gratifying 
to be able to point to printed proofs of critical appreci- 
ation of the above-named books in the days of their 
unknown authorship and comparative obscurity. Mr. 
Benson's books seem to find favor with American readers, 
as appears from the announcement of new editioq^ of 
his " House of Quiet," with an author's introduction, 
and of " The Gate of Death," soon to be issued in this 
countrv.

More of the Pke-Raphaelite 
Brotherhood.* 



The last briefs of the Pre-Raphaelite Brothers 
are fast being turned in. Early this year the 
long awaited autobiography of the venerable 
Mr. Holman Hunt was published ; and a most 
interesting supplement to it has been furnished 
this autumn in the very complete exhibition, 
in London, of Hunt's pictures and drawings. 
Now come the personal reminiscences of one of 
the two surviving Pre-Raphaelites, Mr. William 
Michael Rossetti, who, though he never realized, 
or apparently much tried to realize, the ex- 
pectations of the " P. R. B." that he might be- 
come an active and productive member of their 
painters' guild, has certainly proved himself a 
competent champion and expounder of the faith. 
The " Reminiscences," so Mr. Rossetti points 
out in his preface, make the eighteenth volume 
in which his personal recollections, "more espe- 
cially as affecting other members of the family," 
have appeared. In fifteen out of the preceding 
seventeen volmnes, Dante Gabriel Rossetti is the 
subject ; either some phase or other of his ver- 
satile genius is under discussion, or editorial and 
introductory matter is supplied for some of his 
poems or letters. Thus Mr. W. M. Rossetti may 
safely be accounted in some measure responsible 
for the fact, so deeply deplored by Mr. Holman 
Hunt, that Dante Gabriel's work, with its ex- 
travag-ances and vag-aries corresponding to those 
of its creator, has been so much in the public 
eye, and that he has generally been considered, 
on the mistaken authority of his brother and 
other prejudiced persons, the originator and best 
exponent of Pre-Raphaelitism. As was jjointed 
out in our review of Holman Hunt's autobiog- 
raphy, already referred to, the whole dispute 
rests upon a vital difference in the understanding 
of the term Pre-Raphaelitism. Granted Mr. 
Hunt's definition of the term, he is undoubtedly 
correct in considering himself the first and the 
best Pre-Raphaelite ; but he certainly does not 
use the word as D. G. Rossetti and his followers 
used it, nor as the public has come to under- 
stand it. 

Mr. W. M. Rossetti does not revert to the 
old debate in this his latest volume. He seems 
to feel that his last word upon that, as upon 
many other matters, lias already been said, and 
he is apparently anxious not to be open to the

two volumes. Illustrated. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



charge of vain reijetition. He places a list of 
his previous contributions to Rossetti literature 
in the preface to the present volume, and occa- 
sionally refers the reader to one or another of 
them for information concerning relatives or 
associates. The specific aim of these reminis- 
cences is to detail the facts of their author's own 
life, which though uneventful was not without 
interest, and to hang upon this thread of auto- 
biography any recollections of personages of 
public importance which have been hitherto un- 
recounted. 

It may as well be admitted first as last that 
the general tone of these memoirs is a little dis- 
appointing. Mr. Rossetti is so afraid of saying 
something that he has said already, as well as 
of seeming either to blow his own trumpet or 
to cast undue blame on someone else, that his 
chapters decidedly lack color and movement 
as compared with much of his previous writing. 
The reason for this is probably two-fold. The 
fact that these are his last words makes him 
anxious that they shall be well-considered and 
discreet, and also that they shall omit nothing 
of possible value. The result is that his tone, 
always moderate, becomes almost painfuUy re- 
served, and that he includes many trivial ree(jl- 
lections too scant or superficial to be of any 
particular interest, but which load his biography 
with meaningless detail. Again, Mr. Rossetti 
is not used to holding the centre of the stage : 
that place belonged to his brother Dante Gabriel, 
and after him to his sister Christina ; William 
was too shy, as well as too good a judge of his 
own attainments, to desire or claim it. But by 
the plan of this work he is forced to focus at- 
tention upon himself, and he accordingly grows 
self-conscious and his style becomes formal and 
stilted. Nevertheless, we could ill have spared 
this biography. There are pages of discerning 
criticism and delightful reminiscence, and there 
are occasional illuminating phrases ; while the 
very defects of the book are faults for which we 
esteem its author. Exaggerated reserve is better 
than violated confidence or petty malice. Con- 
sidering the tone of much that has been said and 
written about Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his 
circle, it is small wonder that liis brother should 
prefer to err on the side of reticence. 

In regarding Mr. William M. Rossetti as the 
convenient and accommodating scribe of the 
" P. R. B.," it must not be forgotten that his 
literary career had wider affiliations — that the 
ill-fated " Germ " was far from being ty|)ical of 
his journalistic connections. It should be un- 
derstood that for forty-nine years, ending in 



1906.]

1894, W. M. Rossetti held various appoint- 
ments in the Inland Revenue Office, and it was 
only his not too abundant leisure that could be 
devoted to artistic and literary criticism, edito- 
rial work, encyclopaedia articles, and lecturing. 
To *' The Critic," " The Spectator," '• The Acad- 
emy," and "The Athenaeum." he furnished 
numerous ^e^'iews and exhibition-notices, some- 
times as a staff contributor, at others as an occa- 
sional waiter. Outside of his long series of 
books alx)ut his brother, most of which belong 
to the last eighteen years, his most interesting 
editorial work was that imdertaken for an edi- 
tion of SheUeys poems. This led to a meeting 
and a subsequent warm friendship with Edward 
John Trela\s-ny, who is one of the most pic- 
turesque figures in the " Reminiscences, ' and to 
interviews with Mrs. Hogg — J^e Williams 
when Shelley addressetl poems to her — and 
with Clare Clairmont. Rossetti also edited a 
selection of W hitman's poems for English pub- 
lication, and was among the first critics to 
champion the cause of Browning in print. 

For critical work, William Rossetti has some 
decided temperamental advantages. He is mod- 
est, tactfid. cool, and dispassionate, not enthu- 
siastic and yet tending to a favorable verdict 
rather than to the opposite. On the other hand, 
while a fair critic he can hardly be adjudged to 
have the mind of a great one. His judgment of 
men and books seems superficial ; his phrases 
seldom bite to the core of the matter. In clos- 
ing an account of a meeting \rith Clough, one of 
whose poems he had reriewed in " The Germ," 
he says : "• He [Clough J treated his youthful 
critic with much courtesy, but our interview 
closed without my feeling that I had gained any 
great additional insight into his personality." 
The reader's thought reverts to this sentence at 
the close of many of Rossetti's related inter- 
views. On the other hand, when he says of 
Madox Brown, -* He kept on at painting with a 
well-developed sense of being very scantily ap- 
preciated," or of Bume-Jones. •' His nature had 
the musical ring of glass, not the clangour of 
iron," one feels his power of apt characteriza- 
tion. His account of the relation existing be- 
tween himself and Dante Gabriel is singularly 
accurate and vi\'id, and he makes his onati rather 
curioiLS personality felt on every page of his 
biography. 

Between his literary work, his i-ather *• ad- 
vanced " opinions, his relationship with Dante 
Grabriel, and later \rith ^ladox Brown, whose 
daughter he married, Rossetti had a verj' wide 
circle of literary and artistic acquaintance, and 



a small circle of very choice friends. Of the 
latter he writes, as usual, most entertainingly ; 
it is a pity that he was not wise enough to omit 
all mention of the former except in those rare 
cases where he makes his miniature portraits 
both vivid and significant. 

Mr. Swinburne belongs, of course, to the 
delightfid and delightfully portrayed •' inner 
circle." One of Mr. Rossetti's best anecdotes 
concerns the storm of abuse that greeted the 
publication, in 1866, of Mr. Swinburne's 
" Poems and Ballads." 

" In 1868 Mr. Legros exhibited in the Royal Acad- 
emy an excellent picture of some monks or friars at 
their repast — called ' The Refectory.' There was a 
tabby cat painted in the picture. In that year was pub- 
lished a pamphlet of Notes on the art of the season. 
Mr. Swinburne wrote one section of it, and I the other. 
Mr. Swinburne — who is a great lover of cats (a fancy 
which I share with him), and also (a fancy which I only 
very faintly share) of serpents — vrrote of this painted 
quadruped as ' a splendid cat.' The picture was bought 
— presumably before SMrinbume's euloginm had ap- 
peared — by a person of some distinction. ^lany years 
afterwards, in 1895, I had occasion to look at this 
painting in the house of the heir of the original pur- 
chaser. To my surprise, the cat had disappeared. 
' Why,' said I, * there used to be a cat in that comer of 
i the picture.' ' Yes,' replied the owner, * there was; but 
my predecessor, on seeing that Swinburne had found a 
good word to say for the eat, got her obliterated forth- 
with.' Such was the feeling of the enlightened British 
world for • Poems and Ballads ' and the author thereof." 

The account of Dante Grabriel's enthusiasm 
for Browning is amusing. 

" My brother, by readings, recitations, and preach- 
ments, imposed Browning as a sort of dog^matic standard 
upon the P. R. B., meeting the readiest response from 
Woolner and Stephens, and (it may be in a rather 
minor degree) from Holman Hunt; Millais, so far as I 
can remember, was too busy with his own affairs to do 
much reading, whether of Browning or of anyone, — 
he was however a devotee of Keats. Madox Brown 
proved mainly recalcitrant; to Dante Gabriel's rather 
scornful indignation, he continued to uphold Longfellow 
as the first of living poets, next to Tennyson." 

Of Browning, Rossetti says in part : 
" Both by the tone of his talk and by his personal 
manner, Browning set you very much at your ease. To 
be conscious of your inferiority was, save for the fewest, 
at once right and inevitable ; but he did nothing towards 
screwing the consciousness into you. He seemed to be 
al\s"ays simply and straightforwardly himself: brilliant 
and many-sided, not by any direct endeavour, but be- 
cause this pertained to him. At all points he was vivid 
and alert — the turn of his head, his footfall on the 
floor. . . . To say that Browning was eloquent in talk 
would — so far as my experience extends — be going too 
far; he was also not rhetorical nor long-winded in ex- 
position ; but his talk included most of the good qualities 
short of eloquence — especially masculine acumen and 
versatile promptitude. . . . The time flew fast in his 
company. He spoke but little about himself and his 
poetry, but gave information freely when asked.*'

Mr, Rossetti relates a curious juclg-ment of 
Brownino's to the effect that he considered 
Tommaso Salvini's CEdipus " the finest effort of 
art he had ever beheld ; not only the finest in 
the art of acting, but in any art whatsoever, 
including painting, music, etc." Mr. Rossetti 
adds that he made this extraordinary statement 
"in a tone of entire conviction." 

For Ruskin, Mr. Rossetti has nothing but 
liking and admiration. He pardons many 
things to an over-sensitive mind and to feelings 
" somewhat strained and overstrained, and a 
little liable to take a contrary or perverse bias 
— in the sense that, when there was every fair 
presumption and anticipation that he would be 
well pleased and affirmative, he turned out to 
be pimctilious and negative." 

In general, Mr. Rossetti seems to have kept 
as clear as was humanly possible of the acrid 
disputes in which his impetuous brother and 
irascible father-in-law were continually becom- 
ing involved. He refuses, as has already been 
said, to discuss any of these quarrels save one — 
that with Buchanan — in the "Reminiscences." 
He necessarily mentions some of them — always 
with regret both for the trouble and the breaches 
of friendship that followed. Most keenly does 
he deplore the stand that Madox Brown took 
when the firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulk- 
ner & Co. was dissolved. Owing to Mrs. Wil- 
liam Rossetti's sympathy with her father, it 
was impossible, or at least not easy, for Mr. 
Rossetti to see anything of the Burne-Jones and 
Morris families afterwards. " But," he adds, 
"from first to last I had never any quarrel of 
my own with any member of this group of my 
old familiars." 

Mr. Rossetti has undoubtedly given us, in 
other volumes, the cream of his recoUections of 
his gifted brother, and yet Dante Rossetti is the 
most inspiring figure in these chronicles, and 
the chapter on the early days at Cheyne Walk 
is the most brilliant in the biography, as that 
period was probably the happiest in the life of 
the chronicler. Interesting and quotable is the 
account of the origin and gi'owth of the "Jap- 
anese mania," of the old-furniture craze, of the 
prints, the " pots" and the " beasts," which, 
among them, engrossed so much of Dante 
Gabriel's time and attention. The famous 
wombat, it seems, was discovered in the zoolog- 
ical gardens by William and Christina Rossetti. 
They inspired Dante Grabriel to examine its 
charms — its "fat lumpish look and want of 
sculpturesque form" — and he in turn sent 
Burne-Jones upon the same quest. 



Mr. William Rossetti cherishes no illusion, 
common to brothers of genius, that, given the 
opportunity, he might have ranked with Dante 
Gabriel and Christina. Considering that his 
verse woidd never be more than " passable," 
and that his paintings would never get above 
careful mediocrity, he definitely, and apparently 
without regret, withdrew from the arena. He 
realizes that his literary vocations and his most 
interesting friendships were both in large meas- 
ure due to Gabriel's influence on a retiring, 
self-poised character, prone to accept unques- 
tioningly its limitations and its humble destiny. 
He takes credit to himself that, despite Gabriel's 
magnetic and somewhat overpowering personal- 
ity, his opinions were his own, and his decisions 
were made in conformity to them. He woidd 
be the last to question the statement th^t his 
own life is most interesting when viewed as a 
sort of didl gray background for Dante Gabriel's 
brilliant career.

Figures from Rome's Golden Days.* 



Although not the most profound and scholarly 
among Roman archaeologists, Signor Rodolfo 
Lanciani is certainly the one who has done most 
to make the antiquities and discoveries in Rome 
comprehensible and interesting to the world. 
His gift of skilful presentation of facts, and his 
power to communicate something of the enthu- 
siasm which he has himself felt in turning up 
the soil of the old city, have made his numerous 
books about Ancient Rome as attractive as 
romance. Now he offers a beautiful book upon 
closely-allied subjects, with the title " Golden 
Days of the Renaissance in Rome." The cen- 
tral figures of the book are five :. Paid III., who 
during the fifteen years that he occupied the 
chair of St. Peter's accomplished such wonders 
in rescuing Rome from the degradation into 
which it had fallen ; Michelangelo and Raphael, 
supreme in art ; Vittoria Colonna, the most cul- 
tured of sixteenth century women ; and Agostino 
Chigi, the banker whose splendid financial 
abilities and great wealth gave him the surname 
of " II Magnifico." These figures have been for 
a long time some of the best known of the Re-

naissance, and it has been assumed that every 
obtainable fact in connection with their lives 
must have been alreatly many times retold. But 
it now appears that there is a great deal of com- 
paratively new matter deduced from researches 
anions: obscure documents or the resrJts of 
happy •• finds " in imexpectetl places. 

The fascinating chapter on Vittoria Colonna, 
Marchesa di Pescara, is an illustration. The 
stories of this lady's powerful intellect, sincere 
piety, purity of mind and body, and friendship 
with ^lichelangelo. are assumed to be familiar 
knowledge. Signor Lanciani takes up the ques- 
tions of her burial and the mysterious disap- 
pearance of the remains, which have baffled the 
inquirers of three and a half centuries. Dying 
in the convent of the church of Saint Anna de 
Fimari at Rome, she requested in her \vill that 
she shoidd be buried in that church. Docu- 
ments of the time show that her \s'ish was in 
part carried out, the body being enclosed in a 
wooden coffin coated with tar and left on the 
floor of the church. But such was the cowardly 
fear that seized all those who had been asso- 
ciated with the deceased latly in her work of the 
Italian Reformation, lest the Inquisition should 
mvolve them in the disgrace with which her 
memor}' was threatened, that the coffin was 
abandoned Tsdthout any of the usual impressive 
ceremonies of the Catholic Church. At this 
point, all traces ceased. In 1887, when the 
demolition of the old church was ordered to 
make room for a new street, Signors Lanciani 
and Visconti were commissionetl by the City 
CoimcLl of Rome to oversee the work, and they 
watched the removal of exery brick and stone 
down to the level of the foundations. Not only 
was no coffin coated with tar found, but there 
was no grave at all. This confirmed the sur- 
mise that the coffin had been secretly removed 
from Rome when the posthumous proceedings 
against the Marchesa were initiated by the In- 
quisition. Search began in other cities asso- 
ciated \\dth traditions of the Colonna family, 
but no clue was obtainetl until A\-ithin the pres- 
ent decade. It is now settled beyond doubt that 
the remains of this typical great Italian lady of 
the sixteenth century, the dearest friend that 
Michelangelo ever had, now rest in the sacristy 
of the church of San Dominico Maggiore at 
Naples, by the side of the beloved husband 
whose death preceded hers by twenty-two years, 
and in accordance with the often-expressed wish 
in her poems that she might be reunited to him 
in her last resting-place. The story of the find- 
ing of this long-lost bier reveals the scholarly 



ingenuity and patience with which archaeolo- 
gists, b}' following slight clues, often reach the 
most brilliant residts. 

Financially, the most powerful man in the 
world of these golden days was Agostino Chigi. 
Gifted by nature with keen insight and great tact 
in the art of tratling, before he was f ort^* years old 
he had made a name for himself that impelled 
republics and kingdoms, Christians and infidels, 
popes and sultans alike to seek his help in money 
negotiations and in collecting their revenues and 
customs. Strange as it seems, no complete pub- 
lished biography of this remarkable man exists. 
In a general way, we have known that he had 
boimdless wealth, that he fostered art and artists, 
and that many splendid monimients of his taste 
and generosity still exist in Rome — such as Ra- 
phaels Sybils, in a chapel of the church of Santa 
Maria della Pace, the chapel of our Lady of 
Loreto in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, 
and the casino and gardens of the Villa Fame- 
sina. Signor Lanciani has gathered from MS. 
authorities many new details of the great banker's 
life. The story reads very much like that of the 
" seK-made man " of to-day, and shows that in 
Rome of the sixteenth century, as in America to- 
day, a key of gold will unlock many doors. This 
man, who lived to see his name inscribed among 
the great patrician families in the Libro dOro, 
had no lineage worth mentioning, and started in 
business with a partner when their aggi'egate 
capital was but little more than two thousand dol- 
lars. From the first, he was a bold speculator. 
Even in our days of money kings and railway 
magnates, we have nothing to match the stories 
of his countless enterprises at home and abroad, 
and of his gorgeous style of li\'ing in his villa 
on the banks of the Tiber, now known as Villa 
Famesina. At one of his Lucidlean feasts, to 
prove that the same silver plate was not Used 
tvs-ice in the course of me meal, the dishes were 
thrown into the Tiber ; at another, each of the 
twenty' cardinals or foreign representatives was 
served on silver and gold plate, bearing his par- 
ticular coat of arms, crest, and motto. \N-ith such 
accuracy on the part of the butiers that not one 
mistake occurred in the course of the meal. Each 
guest also was served with fish, game, fruit, veg- 
etables, delicacies, and Avines peculiar to his own 
country, these supplies being brought to Rome 
by messengers timed to arrive simvdtaneously 
from the foiu* corners of the earth on the very eve 
of the banquet. 

But these tales of a loud and vulgar display 
of wealth are atoned for by Agostino's great 
and enduring services to art. He was a bom

collector, and his various residences were filled 
with pictures, statues, bronzes, busts, until there 
was no room for more. His characteristic con- 
nection with art, as with business, was originality 
of concejjtion. He gave the inspiring note, and 
the artists adapted themselves to it to the best 
of their ability. He protected such artists as 
Raphael, Perugino, Giulio Romano, Lorenzetto, 
Bramante, Sodoma, even in the face of the ill- 
will of popes and cardinals. When Leo X. dis- 
missed Sodoma from his commission to paint 
certain rooms in the Vatican, and substituted 
Raphael, Agostino felt the offense to his protege 
as a personal one, and at once set him to paint- 
ing his own bedi'oom. The result was " The 
Wedding of Alexander and Roxana " — one of 
Sodoma's most delightful works, seldom seen, 
however, as visitors are not often admitted to 
the upper floor of the Farnesina. Rich as 
this period was in noble creations of art, we 
should have lost some of its gTeatest achieve- 
ments without the ideas and the purse of 
Agostino Chigi. 

The remaining figures which appear in this 
book are scarcely less interesting, and the two 
opening chapters, on " The City " and " Life in 
the City," give the proper setting to the whole. 
In a backward glance, due significance is given 
to the act of Pope Gregory XL (1377) in leav- 
ing Avignon and restoring to Rome the seat of 
the supreme pontificate, of which it had been 
deprived for seventy-two years. It is said that 
the young Pope was so affected by the transi- 
tion from the gay and refined life of Avignon 
to the horrors of Rome that he died the follow- 
ing year, and that his memory was treated with 
contempt, as that of a weakling, by the Romans. 
Signor Lanciani takes the death of this man as 
the period marking the end of the Middle Ages 
and the beginning of tiie Renaissance. The 
transition from one to the other was neither 
sudden nor noticeable at first, but the simple 
fact of the head of the Church havinsr asrain 
taken up his residence in the city of the Tiber, 
where himdreds and thousands of pilgrims were 
expected to assemble from every part of the 
globe each quarter of a century, not only saved 
the city from abandonment or final collapse, but 
gave it a new lease of life and helped it towards 
its moral and material regeneration. 

The many matters which Signor Lanciani has 
taken out of their semi-obscurity in the Italian 
archives of learned societies and made available 
to the English reader, the many stories which 
he has himself aided in unfolding, entitle him 
to not a little gratitude. Thirty-one full-page 



plates and sixty-one illustrations, many of them 
from rare sources and here published for the first 
time, are worthy accompaniments of these charm- 
ing pages of text. Anna B. McMahan. 



The 8el,f-Revelatio]s^ of 
IjAFCADIO Hearx * 



The thrill of pleasurable anticipation awak- 
ened by the annoimcement of the publication of 
" The Life and Letters of Lafcadio Hearn " 
finds its fulfilment in the delight afforded by 
the book itself. In it we are given that pro- 
foundly interesting thing, insight into a noble, 
sensitive, and refined human soul. The revela- 
tion is of course but partial ; more than that 
were impossible, for, as Hearn himself has said 
in one of these letters, " No man, as a general 
rule, shows his soul to another man ; he shows 
it only to a woman, — and then only with the 
assurance that she won't give him away. As a 
matter of fact she can't : — the Holy Ghost 
takes care of that ! " 

In all the world of letters there are few char- 
acters more striking than that of Lafcadio 
Hearn. His personality was unique. The story 
of his life is in many ways a pathetic one. Sel- 
dom has notable achievement been accomplished 
in the face of greater difficulties and discour- 
agements. For the most part, the root of these 
lay within himself. The disability caused by 
defective vision he surmounted ; his incapacity 
for anything connected with business shut him 
out from many things for which he greatly 
longed, and made his life-journey an unceasing 
struggle. Yet in all the bitter experiences of 
his early years, when ill and half -blind, cast 
adrift by his relatives, and sinking so low that 
for awhile he had to seek refuge in a London 
workhouse in a vile quarter by the Thames, he 
resolutely kept on with his studies and never 
allowed the fire he had kindled upon the altar 
of the imagination to burn dim. 

The life of a man so shrinking and retired 
could only be written by one who had been for 
many years one of his closest friends. Mrs. 
Wetmore (better known as Elizabeth Bisland) 
has wisely let the story be told for the most 
part in Hearn's own words. The unconscious 
self -revelation in his letters, and the exquisite 
fragments of personal recollection that were 
found among his papers after his death, need 
little by way of supplement from the hand of

the biogi-apher. That little, despite some un- 
evenness of workmanship and the occasional use 
of a word in a A^Tong sense, has been done very 
well, and vnth imderstanding and sympathy. 
Four chapters, comprising about a third of one 
volume. — that is all there is of the introductory 
sketch, and even that is largely taken up with 
extracts from Heam's writings. The rest of 
the book is made up of his letters, placed by 
themselves without comment. This imusual 
arrangement has both its advantages and disad- 
vantages. The gaps seem more pronounced, the 
transitions more abrupt ; but at the same time 
the strength and variety and beauty of these 
wonderful letters are made all the more apparent. 
Mrs.Wetmore is fortunately able to add some 
details to what was previously known about 
Heams early years. He was born in 1850, in 
the Grecian island of Lefcada, after which he 
was named. His mother, Rosa Cerigote. was a 
beautiful Greek girl, for whom his father, Sur- 
geon-Major Charles Bush Heam, conceived a 
passionate attachment that led to a romantic 
marriage. For a few years Dr. Heam and his 
wife lived together happily, but after he took 
his famil}- to Dublin there was an estrangement 
followed by separation. Mrs. Heam abandoned 
her children and fled to Smyrna vnth a Greek 
cousin whom she afterward married. Lafcadio 
was sent to Wales to Dr. Heam's aunt, Mrs. 
Brenane, and never again saw either of his 
parents. .All his life he felt this deprivation. 
Long years after, he wrote to the younger 
brother from whom also he was separated and 
whom he did not see again : 

" Aud you do not remember that dark and beautiful 
face — with large, brown eyes like a wild deer's — that 
used to bend above your cradle ? You do not remember 
the voice which told you each night to cross your fingers 
after the old Greek orthodox fashion, and utter the 
words — ' In the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost ' ? 

" When I saw your photograph I felt all my blood 
stir, — and I thought, ' Here is the imknown being, in 
whom the soid of my mother lives, — who must have 
known the same strange impidses, the same longings, 
the same resolves as I ! Will he tell me of them ? 
There was another Self, — woidd that Self interpret 
This ? . . . Wliatever there is of good in me came 
from that dark race-soid of wliich we know so little. 
My love of right, my hate of wrong; — my admiration 
for what is beautiful or true; — my capacity for faith 
in man or woman ; — my sensitiveness to artistic things 
which gives me whatever little success I have, — even 
that language-power whose physical sign is the large 
eyes of both of us, — came from Her. ... It is the 
mother who makes us, — makes at least all that makes 
the nobler man: not his strength or powers of calcula- 
tion, but his heart aud power to love. And I woidd 
rather have her portrait than a fortune." 



The grand-aunt by whom Lafcadio was 
brought up was the widow of a wealthy Irishman, 
and an ardent convert to Romanism. Nothing 
that Heam ever wrote is more precious than the 
attempts he made to recall something of his ex- 
periences during those early days when he livetl 
under her roof. One of them tells of an occa.s- 
ional A-isitor to the house whom he was taught 
to call " Cousin Jane," and of her startling ad- 
monition one gloomy winter morning when she 
disc!Overed that the child had no comprehension 
of God. 

" At once she caught me up, placed me upon her lap, 
and fixed her black eyes upon my face with a piercing 
earnestness that terrified me, as she exclaimed: 

" « My child ! — is it possible that you do not know 
who God is ? ' 

" ' No, ' I answered in a choking whisper. 

" ' God! — God who made you! — God who made the 
sun and the moon and the sky, — and the trees and the 
beautiful flowers, — -everything! . . . You do not know?' 

" I was too much alarmed by her manner to reply. 

"'You do not know,' she went on, 'that God made 
you and me? — that God made your father and mother 
and everybody. . . . ' You do not know about Heaven 
and HeU? ' 

" I do not remember all the rest of her words; I can 
recall with distinctness only the following: 

" ' And send you down to Hell to bum alive in fire for 
ever and ever! . . . Think of it! — always burning, 
burning, burning, — screaming and burning! scream- 
ing and burning! — never to be saved from that pain of 
fire ! . . . You remember when you burned your finger 
at the lamp? — Think of your whole body burning, — 
always, always, always burning! — for ever and ever ! ' 

" I can stUl see her face as in the instant of that utter- 
ance, — the horror of it, and the pain. . . . Then she 
suddenly burst into tears, and kissed me and left the 
room." 

Lafcadio was then aged not more than six, — 
passionate, sensitive, impressionable, and living 
in the dreamland of the imagination from which 
he never entirely emergetl. " For the best of 
possible reasons,' he says, '• I then believed in 
ghosts and in goblins, — because I saw them, both 
by day and by night." It is not strange, there- 
fore, that some time after the event just narrated 
Cousin Jane shoidd have appeared to him in an 
apparition. She passed him in the hall and went 
into a bedroom. 

" I ran after her, calling out ' Cousin Jane ! Cousin 
Jane ! ' I saw her pass round the foot of a great four- 
pillared bed, as if to approach the window beyond it ; and 
I followed her to the other side of the bed. Then as if 
first aware of my presence, she turned ; and I looked up, 
expecting to meet her smile. . . . She had no face. 
There was only a pale blur instead of a face. And even 
as I stared, the figure vanished. It did not fade ; it sim- 
ply ceased to be, — like the shape of a flame blown out." 

These memories of lus boyhood were recalled, 
he says, only with much effort, and in telling 
them there was the consciousness that his later 



450

and "more artificial Self" was trying to speak 
instead of the Self that was. In these boyish 
imaginings no doubt the interest he always felt 
in the ghostly and supernatural had its incep- 
tion. A lesser mind would easily have been 
unbalanced by it, but he was too deep a thinker 
to be thus led astray. 

Mrs. Brenane's efforts to make a Catholic of 
Lafcadio met with no success. He was sent 
for two years to a Jesuit college in France, and 
later to Ushaw, the Roman Catholic college at 
Durham. While there he met with the great- 
est misfortune of his life in the loss of the sight 
of one eye. About the same time, his rejection 
of Romanism led to a complete rupture with 
his grand-aunt, and he was plunged at once 
into the direst poverty. How he lived and how 
he met this experience is told in a letter to one 
of his Japanese pupils. 

" When I was a boy of sixteen, although my blood 
relations were — some of them — very rich, no one 
would pay anything to help me finish my education. I 
had to become what you never had to become — a ser- 
vant. I partly lost iny sight. I had two years of 
sickness in bed. I had no one to help me. And I had 
to educate myself in spite of all difficulties." 

Somehow he made his way to New York, 
where he managed to exist for two years, "griev- 
ously tormented by grim realities " which he 
did not know how to surmount. So, he says, 
" I tried to forget them as much as possible, and 
romantic dreams daily nourished at a public 
library helped me to forget." Although his 
outward circumstances were gradually bettered 
as the years went on, he never ceased to live 
this dual life. To the end, the visions in which 
he revelled were verities scarcely less tangible 
than the facts of daily experience. It was in 
one of his later years that he wrote : 

" Always having lived in hopes and imaginations, the 
smallest practical matters that everybody should know, I 
don't know anything about. Nothing, for example, about 
a boat, a horse, a farm, an orchard, a watch, a garden. 
Nothing about what a man ought to do under any possible 
circumstances. I know nothing but sensation and books." 

Another of the early reminiscences tells of 
the journey to Cincinnati, where he began his 
literary career as a newspaper reporter. In 
New Orleans, whither he drifted a little later, 
he found a congenial atmosphere, and oppor- 
tunity for the incursions into strange lore of all 
kinds that had ever a potent fascination for 
him. To his friend H. E. Krehbiel he wrote : 

" This is a land where one can really enjoy the Inner 
Life. Every one has an inner life of his own — which 
no other life can see, and the great secrets of which are 
never revealed, although occasionally when we create 
something beautiful we betray a faint glimpse of it." 



But in time the charm wore off. The Eden of his 
dreams was always in the unattainable elsewhere. 
Once he found it for a little while when he visited 
the island of Martinique. And later, in Japan, 
he experienced for one brief year the joy of actual 
realization. This was at Matsue, where he went 
as a teacher in the Government school. There, 
to his great delight, he found that the manners 
and customs of Old Japan still survived almost 
luichanged. There he found his wife, and there 
he spent what was perhaps the happiest period 
of his life. Before the glamour faded, loss of 
health compelled his removal to a place where the 
winters were less rigorous. The thirteen years 
that yet remained were spent in the New Japan 
which had for him no illusions. 

The super-sensitiveness of the artistic tem- 
perament is a heavy handicap in coping with the 
world. That temperament Hearn possessed in 
marked degree. From \asible beauty he was shut 
out by his extreme near-sightedness, and so he 
turned to the beauties of the intellect. He be- 
came a thinker and dreamer. His aim was the 
writing of poetic prose. The creative impulse of 
the artist compelled him to work and gave him a 
keen sense of the value of time. Work forced by 
necessity he hated ; yet it was in work that he 
found his chief pleasure. And his work was good. 
From the nature of their subjects, his books have 
had a narrower circle of readers than they de- 
serve ; but it requires no prophetic eye to per- 
ceive that as the years go on the permanence of 
their place in literature will come to be recog- 
nized, and more and more they wiU be valued 
for the aptness and lieauty of their phraseology, 
the singidar felicity with which words were found 
to convey the most delicate shades of meaning. 

It would be impossible to give in a few words 
any adequate impression of the rare quality of 
the letters that make up the larger part of this 
book. The range of subjects upon which they 
touch is as wide as life itself. They reflect the 
varying moods of the writer's ever alert and 
well stored mind ; they tell of his hopes and 
fears, of his aspirations, his sensations and ideas, 
his views about men and books. They are philo- 
sophical and even humorous by turns. Not one 
among them is didl. But this is not the secret 
of their power. It is impossible to read them 
and not feel acquainted Avith the writer — with 
the real man behind the mask. He is no longer 
a vagiie somebody known onlj^ by name and 
reputation, but one with whom we have been in 
close personal contact through the magic of his 

facile pen.

Old Evelyx ix Holiday Attike.* 



John Evelyn died, a very old man, in 1706, 
lea\ang behind him in the library at Wotton, 
among other manuscripts, an ordered series of 
memoirs. In 1814 the mistress of Wotton, 
\sadow of Evelyn's great-great-grandson, showed 
this manuscript, which she regarded as a mildly 
interesting relic, to a librarian named Upcott, 
who had Ijeen commissioned to catalogue the 
Wotton books. He secured permission to pub- 
lish the manuscript, turned it over to William 
Bray, an antiquarian of standing, and in 1818 
the first edition was published. The first edi- 
tion of Pepys did not appear until 1825. Bray's 
final edition appeared in 1827 ; and this version 
has l^een frequently reprinted. In 1879 Mr.

1827 edition] of the diary was very correctly 
printed from the MS., and may l)e relied on as 
giving an accurate text.' The Colbum edition 
was consequently reprinted, with a Life and a 
Bibliography by Mr. Wheatley. This version, 
•• in order to commemorate the two hundredth 
anniversary of Evelyn's death.'" is now reprinted 
^^dth new illusti-ations. Mr. Wheatley deplores, 
in his Preface, the impossibility of getting a 
complete edition of the Diary. He plainly im- 
plies that his own version is as nearly complete 
as can be had under present conditions. 

^Ir. Dobson's edition makes it clear that this 
implication, however ingenuous, is misleading. 
Upcott, the original discoverer of the Diary, 
retained his interest in it all his life. He actu- 
ally compared the 1827 edition ^dth the original 
manuscript, " by which many material omissions 
in the earlier quartos were supplied, and other 
not imim}x)rtant corrections made." These la- 
bors were made use of by Forster (the biographer 
of Landor) in an edition published in 1850. 
This Ijecame the Bohn text, and is the text 
upon which Mr. Dobson builds his new edition. 

" It woidd be going too far," says Mr. Dob- 
son, with his usual caution, " to claim the addi- 
tions of Upcott as of any signal importance, — 
many of them, indeed, by Forster's own admis- 
sion, consist of ' trifling personal details,' and

Imported by Charles Scribner's Sons. 



they are practically confined to the earlier por- 
tion of the first volume. But Forster's text has 
long enjoyed a deserved reputation ; it was de- 
clared by the • Quarterly Review,* as late as 
1896, to ' leave little to be desired ": and being 
demonstrably the fullest, it has been adopted in 
the present case." Mr. Dobson retains, and 
somewhat extends, the modernized spelling of 
the Upcott- Forster text, — a blessing for all 
concerned, since Evelyn "s speUing is mainly a 
matter of chance. In facsimile taken from 
manuscript, such aberrations are of whimsical 
interest ; but for the general reader they are a 
nui.sance. The original misspellings ai'e retained 
in the ^Tieatley edition. 

But what gives Mr. Dobson's edition its 
importance is less its text than its " editorial 
equipment." Mr. Wheatley contributes a re- 
spectable life of Evelyn, but is otherwise content 
to reprint Bray, notes and all. Mr. Dobson 
i^Tites a much better life, or Introduction, as he 
calls it ; and most of the notes, which are char- 
acteristic and illuminating, are his own. These 
are modestly imprisoned in brackets, while the 
notes of Bray and Forster, however modified, 
go free. The numerous appendixes are as truly 
illustrative as the pictures, which are admirable 
both in kind and in reproduction. It is to be 
said that the illusti-ations in JVIr. Wheatley's 
edition are very nearly as good, though not so 
numerous. One does not quite understand why, 
with no appreciable difference in thickness of 
paper, size of type, or number of pages, Air. 
Wheatley should need four volumes octavo while 
Mr. Dobson needs but three. Both sets are at- 
tractive in typography and general appearance ; 
Mr. Dobson's being nearly identical with his 
recent edition of Fanny Bumey. 

It has been my business to .speak hei-e of these 
two editions of Evelyn rather than of Evelyn 
himself. But in looking them over I have found 
an old impression of him somewhat deepened. 
For I have kept stumbling upon passages of such 
boyish enthusiasm, such childlike curiosity, such 
(if it must be said) womanish excitement over 
trifles, as to transport me incontinent into the 
heaven of trivialities and quiddities where dwells 
that cheerf id contemporary and sometime gossip 
of Evelyns, Samuel Pepys. One is sorry that 
EveljTi did not find place in his memoirs (as 
Mr. Dobson rightly calls them) for so much as 
a mention of the bustling friend who paid him 
such imgrudged tribute. It is common to 
contrast them as the reverend signor and the 
garnUous chronicler of small Ijeer. Evelyn, the

black and white, is a more formal, possibly a 
more dignified, person than our busy Pepys, 
babbling to himself under his breath of the 
infinitesimal things which take up the lives of 
most men, but which most men are too sheepish 
to mention even to themselves. But there are 
seasons when Evelyn also babbles delectably ; he 
has the true Pepysian delight in novelties and 
gimcracks, trick fountams, grottos, fire-eaters, 
" arithmetical wheels, quench-fires, and new 
harps." In describing such portents as the great 
fire and the gi'eater plague, to be sure, he attains 
a note beyond Pepys ; but the likenesses between 
them are as striking as the differences. With 
such fresh heart, alert step, and inquiring eye, 
men made their way through the fog and the mire 
of that much-despised day. Alas, not even our 
great-great-great-grandfathers can now teach us 
the secret of that youth. jj ^r Boynton. 



Holiday Books of Travel, and 
Description.* 



With an abundance of profusely illustrated 
books of travel pouring from the press, why un- 
dergo the fatigue of an actual journey ? Travel, 
outside the covers of a book, often dispels some 
very pretty illusions. The following works — 
a few out of many of like nature — are necessa- 
rily treated with brevity, almost with uncere- 
monious curtness ; but if their excellences receive 
scant recognition, their defects too are charitably 
dismissed with few words.

Waller teUs her story of a winter spent at The 
Hague, with excursions to the usual points of 
interest, all set off with illustrations from paint- 
ings and drawings, and printed and bound in 
handsome form. A prominent part throughout 
is played by " James " — James Moulton, archi- 
tect, supposed to be the wi-iter's husband and 
to be competing for the new Peace Palace de- 
signs. He helps to make conversation and to 
break up the page into invitingly short para- 
graphs with an attractive sprinkling of quotation 
marks. Inevitably there is considerable de- 
scription of Dutch scenery, urban, rural, and 
aquatic. If such things must be undertaken 
with pen instead of brush, the author is fairly 
successful. Of the young Queen she gives this 
picture : 

" I sat nearly opposite to her [at the opera] for three 
hours, and I had time to stndy the face of this yonng 
royal ruler. ... At eighteen she was a beauty. At 
twenty-six she had aged nearly twenty years from that 
youth. It is sad, pathetic almost, to see such a change; 
for to the young, life's cup should be brimmed to over- 
flowing. This is the ' divine right ' of youth. Poor little 
queen ! Too yoimg to bear the burdens of a royal name 
and what it entails ! " 

Something of the unfading charm of Italy is 
caught in the pages of Miss Wharton's " Italian 
Days and Ways." Her readers do not need to 
be told that (to quote from her opening chapter) 
" it is inspiring to travel with a woman, no 
longer young, to whom the world and its inhab- 
itants still wear ' the glory and the dream.' " 
This, of course, she writes in reference not to 
herself, but to the elder of her two companions, 
to the younger of whom she later acknowledges 
herseK to stand in the relation of " chaperon 
and temporary guardian." These sketches of 
scenes and adventures in Rome, Naples, Flor- 
ence, Genoa, Venice, and elsewhere in Italy, 
are clothed in epistolary dress of an informal 
but always gi'acefidly fitting pattern. The pic- 
torial accompaniment is from photogTaphs, and 
is not confined to the famous and familiar. Of 
Michael Angelo's " Twilight " and " Dawn," 
the remark is made that " they seem to be slip- 
ping off the pitiable pedestals which support 
them "; and Ruskin is quoted, to whom these 
figures spoke " not of morning nor evening, but 
of the departure and the resurrection, the twi- 
light and the dawn of the souls of men." 

The latest addition to Mr. Clifton Johnson's 
" Highways and Byways '" series takes the reader 
to the Mississippi Valley. The greater part of the 
book, as some will recall and as a note explains, 
has already seen the light in " Outing " and other 
periodicals. The author moves northward from

the river's mouth to its head- waters, pressing the 
bulb of his camera at short intervals, until he 
has produced sixty-three excellent photographs of 
animate and inanimate nature. From the chap- 
ter entitled " Mark Twam's Country " (Hannibal, 
Missouri) the following wUi interest all readers : 
" The house the humorist lived iii still stands [a pic- 
ture is given] and is much the same as it always was — 
a stumpy, two-storj-, clapboarded dwelling close to the 
sidewalk. . . . The senior Clemens had a printing shop 
upstairs in the L of the house, and as there were several 
children the li\'ing rooms must have beeu pretty well 
crowded. ' All the family was the nicest people you ever 
saw,' I was told; ' but they were very poor and the father 
died bankrupt when Mark was twelve years old.' On 
the next street lived ' Huckleberry Finn,' whose real 
name was Tom Blankenshipp. ... In actual life he and 
all his relatives were a very rough lot, and when he left 
town it was to go to the penitentiary." 

The Huckleberry Finn house, too, is still stand- 
ing. Supplementary notes for the guidance of 
travellers increase the book's usefidness. Its 
double A^Tappers, paper and linen, are artistic, 
and the linen one is durable. 

Another illustrated travel series receives an 
attractive addition in Mr. Frank Roy Fraprie's 
" Little Pilgrimages among Bavarian Inns." 
The author is said to liave taken a course of art 
study at Munich in preparation for some such 
tour with his camera as tliat which has residted 
in the present volume. His connection, too, with 
the "American Amateur Photographer " would 
lead one to expect good pictures from him ; nor 
is the ex]>ectation disappointed. The point of 
view appears always to be well chosen, the defi- 
nition is of the clearest, and the slightly bro^\^^- 
ish tone of the prints gives them somewhat the 
effect of etchings. The descriptive and historical 
matter will interest both past and prospective 
travellers in a region where, to quote the author, 
are to be found " scenery as beautiful as any in 
the Swiss Alps, a country where extortion from 
travellers is almost unkno^\^l, and a hospitable and 
kindly peasantry, who still retain in large meas- 
ure the simplicity of life of their forefathers." 

Just as breathless, sparkling, superficial, and 
amusing as his Parisian sketches is Mi\ F. Berke- 
ley Smith's snap-shot picture of London, entitled 
" Li London Town." Very taking illustrations 
by the author himself, by Mr. Phil May, Mr. 
Frank RejTiolds, and others, are pro\aded in 
abundance : and %vith their help, and that of the 
brisk and snappy narrative and descriptive mat- 
ter, one is transported to •• the DcatI's Highway " 
(Piccatlilly ),to that gilded palace of frivolity, the 
Gaiety Theatre, to the Empire and the Alham- 
bra music halls, to the passing show at Hyde 



Park and the busy scenes of the Strand. A 
brief breathing spell at a near-by country house, 
and a mouthfid of sea-air at Brighton, are wel- 
come : and then we hasten back to our beloved 
boulevards, with a nightmare remembrance of 
the London Sunday and less gloomy impressions 
of other things — all of which it is well to have 
seen through the eyes of our observant artist- 
author. 

The very title of Mr. Donald Maxwell's book, 
" A Cruise across Europe," excites curiosity. 
There have been many a tour and run and scam- 
per across the much be-travelled continent, but 
surely never before a fresh-water voyage from 
Holland to the Black Sea. The preface declares 
that '• of all the navigable throughf ares of Europe 
there is none so little known or so seldom used 
as the Ludwig's Canal, which lies in Bavaria 
between Bamburg and Kelheim." By this canal, 
which, we are told, was begun by Charlemagne 
and is a hundred miles long, small craft may 
climb fifteen hundred feet above sea-level and 
cross the mountain-range separating the Rhine 
from the Danube. The passage through this 
waterway is described in a chapter fitly entitled 
" nautical moimtaineering." The entire voyage, 
one of incident and adventure, including encoun- 
ters with the police, is well narrated, and still 
better illustrated by the author himself and an- 
other artist. One himdred pictures, large and 
small, and four maps, make a generous allowance. 
The heavy glazed paper renders the volume more 
inviting as a picture-book than as a book to read. 
Good literature and dazzlingly brilliant jjaper go 
not well together. 

The nouns and verbs in Miss Whiting's book 
of far- western ti'avel, " The Land of Enchant- 
ment," have an easy time, so much of the bur- 
den is shouldered by the adjectives and adverbs, 
in various degrees of comparison. But our 
truly gigantic mountain scenery may well strain 
the powers of expression. " The record of the 
ages," we read in a characteristic passage de- 
scriptive of Pike's Peak, " is written on parch- 
ment that will never crumble. The mysteries 
of the very creation itself, — of all this vast 
and marvellous West^ — of infinite expanse of 
sea and of volcanic fires that swallowed up the 
waters and crystallized them into granite and 
porphyry, — this very record of Titanic pro- 
cesses is ^v^itten, in mystic characters, in that 
far upper air where the lofty Peak reigns in 
unapproachable majesty." More than half the 
book is devoted to Coloi-ado ; New Mexico, Ari- 
zona, and Southern California claim the remain-

der. Apart from the enthusiasm (the Schw'dr- 
merei^ as the Germans would say) that ani- 
mates the narrative, and the wealth of imagery 
that adorns it, nothing new could be expected 
from this Pullman-car explorer ; but she has 
brought back some excellent photographs, and 
thirty-five are given in clean-cut plates. It is 
almost needless to add that quotations from the 
poets abound. 

Twenty-five years of observation and experi- 
ence in the desert have resulted in a remarkable 
and valuable work from the pen of Mr, George 
Wharton James, entitled " The Wonders of the 
Colorado Desert." This vast territory of moun- 
tain and plain, thinly settled and showing but 
few signs of vegetable or animal life, is not in 
Colorado, as most readers would assume at the 
outset, but in Southern California, and it may 
truly be regarded as a part of Miss Whitings 
" Land of Enchantment." Besides the very full 
and painstaking descriptive and historical matter 
of these volumes, there are given more than 
three hundred admirable drawings from nature, 
including a delicately beautiful colored frontis- 
piece, by Mr. Carl Eytel, and numerous full- 
page photographic prints. A chapter, too, on 
Mr. Eytel himself is one of the best in the book. 
Some portion of the writer's enthusiasm for this 
vast expanse of aridity and heat and barren rocks 
and sands might perhaps be accounted for by his 
having studied it, in part, from a safe and fairly 
comfortable post of observation on the outskirts, 
" within five and a half hours' ride from my 
Pasadena home, where library and pictures and 
piano and flowers and birds and congenial society 
all conspire to keep me, ' and whither, doubtless, 
they do occasionally call him. Between this and 
being athirst in the desert there must be a con- 
siderable difference. Yet Mr. James evidently 
knows what it is to rough it, and he has written 
most instructively and entertainingly of his rov- 
ing experiences. The agricultural possibilities 
of this district, under artificial irrigation, are 
enlarged upon, and they are indeed marvellous. 
May they some day be realized, as indeed they 
have already begun to be. The dedication of the 
book "to the Source, the Maker of Deserts," 
is a little startling, but becomes less so as one 
turns the pages descriptive of this land of 
wonders. 

The Philippine Islands are treated, descrip- 
tively, historically, industrially, commercially, 
and politically, by Mr. Charles Harcourt Forbes- 
Lindsay, at present a Philadelphia business man 
and writer, formerly of the English army. It 
does not appear that his book, entitled " The 



Philippines under Spanish and American Rules," 
is based on personal observation and on study 
of Philippine problems in the islands themselves. 
Its character and tone may be gathered from 
the preface, in which the author says : 

" For my statements regarding industries, resources, 
etc., I have depended, in tlie main, upon ample sources 
of information afforded by the U. S. War Department, 
having been taught by experience to regard them as 
the most reliable. I have avoided polemic discussion, 
becaixse there are others much better qualified than 
myself to pass opinion on the controversial questions 
connected with the Philippines ; but that the reader . . . 
may be satisfied, I have fully remedied the deficiency 
on my part by inserting a chapter of extracts from pub- 
lie addresses delivered by the Honorable William H. 
Taft," etc. 

Twenty-six photogravure illustrations from 
photographs are given, one of them being en- 
titled, with an attempt at grammatical harmony, 
"Filipina Women." The book is dedicated, by 
permission, to Mr. Taft, and his portrait faces 
the dedication. 

Mr. Herbert W. Tompkins explains at the 
outset that his book, " In Constable's Country," 
" is not an essay on Constable and his art. It 
is a transcript of impressions, penned, in the 
first instance, by the wayside." Nevertheless 
he gives occasional expression to his art theo- 
ries, as when, in discussing the painting, "Flat- 
ford Mill," he is inclined to think that "a land- 
scape may be truly ideal, apart from any inven- 
tion by the artist"; and also when he says of 
Constable : " That he was a realist will hardly 
be disputed ; but how ideal the real may appear 
we perceive, clearly enough, as we turn the 
pages of ' Constable's Sketches.' " The region 
described is, in general, Suffolkshire. Literary 
and historical references enrich Mr. Tomp- 
kins's pages and help to relieve the inevitable 
tedium of verbal scene-painting. The fifteen 
reproductions of Constalile's landscapes are in 
color, and, so far as a colored print can suggest 
the original, are not bad. The frontispiece is 
a portrait of the artist himself, from a tinted 
pencil-drawing by his own hand. 

A book luxuriously made for the holiday 
trade is Mr. Edward Thomas's " The Heart of 
England," with its forty-eight colored pictures 
by Mr. H. L. Richardson. The ample page 
(ten by eight), the heavy paper, clear type, 
broad margins, ornamental binding, and, above 
all, the many bright illustrations, form a strik- 
ing if somewhat gaudy combination. Rambling 
descriptive matter, with a sprinkling of poetry 
and philosophy, and an occasional backward 
glance at the " old-fashioned times," serve to 
string the pictures together.

Miscellaneous Holiday Publications. 



All collectors of china will gloat over Mr. W. 
Moore Binns's " The First Century of English Por- 
celain," and the person who spends much time over 
the book and escapes without a bad case of the craze 
for '• pots " must indeed have been born without 
the instinct of a collector. Mr. Binns was for years 
the art director of the Worcester Royal Porcelain 
Works, and is at present managing director of sev- 
eral famous potteries. He explains that he is '• a 
practical potter with artistic inclinations, who has 
had neither the leisure nor the means to enable him 
to aspire to the rank of a collector." In the prac- 
tical and technical side of his subject, which most 
amateur collectore find very baffling, he is therefore 
thoroughly at home, and his exact and careful distinc- 
tions will prove extremely useful to readers who aspire 
to be thorough students of the keramic art. If not 
a collector himself. Mr. Binns is a friend of many 
collectors, who have put at his disposal unrivalled 
specimens of china to examine and illustrate. The 
British and South Kensington Museums, the Welsh 
Museum at Cardiff, and the Worcester Royal Com- 
pany have also extended special courtesies to Mr. 
Binns. so that his study of late eighteenth and early 
nineteenth century English porcelain is likely to 
remain the authoritative work for the period. Mr. 
Binns has command of a compact, nervous, and 
well-ordered style. He is technical without being 
involved or obscure, and his historical facts are pic- 
turesque in spite of full and accurate detail. In short, 
Mr. Binns is a thorough connoisseur with a gift for 
imparting his enthusiasms — a combination as rare 
as it is delightful. An introductory chapter equips 
the reader with some fundamental facts regarding 
pastes, glazes, and colors, and helps him to estimate 
correctly the value and significance of trade and 
workmen's marks. Eighteen varieties of porcelain 
are then discussed in as many chapters, the longest 
naturally being devoted to the Bow, Chelsea. Wor- 
cester, and Derby wares. A chronological table of 
the progress of English keramics follows, giving 
significant events and their dates between 1744 and 
1848. Three brief appendixes and a copious index 
of subjects complete the bulky folio, which is bound 
in cloth with a cover design suggesting the decolla- 
tions on Dresden china. One feature remains to be 
spoken of — the exquisite full-page illustrations, 
seventy-seven in number, many of them printed in 
colors, and altogether furnishing the best possible 
substitute for a visit to the collections from which 
the pictm-ed specimens were taken. Indeed, color 
and form and pattern are so faithfully and artisti- 
cally reproduced that one feels almost as if he were 
handling cups and plates instead of turning pages, 
and the book will be prized as a real art-treasure by 
its fortunate possessors, quite as much as for its store 
of information. The work is imported by the J. B. 
Lippincott Company, to whom American collectors 
certainly owe a debt of gratitude. 



Of the new edition of Cellini's Autobiogi-aphy 
produced by ]Mr. D. B. Updike at the Merrj-mount 
Press, it may be said at once that no more distin- 
guished piece of book-making has come from an 
American press for a long while past. It occupies 
two octavo volumes, printed on soft toned paper 
from a large size of the type-face that Mr. Updike 
uses so freely — a graceful combination of '* old- 
style " and *' modern " fonts. The typography, while 
usually excellent, is not impeccable. We notice, for 
instance, a case in which the last line of a paragraph 
is made to begin a page (p. XV.), where a slight 
change of wording would have made this impropri- 
ety unnecessary. The press-work is beautifully clear 
and even throughout. A few decorative initials in 
red add a charming minor note, and there is an 
ornate title-page to each volume designed by Mr. 
Thomas Maitlaud Cleland. Especial praise must be 
accorded the forty or more photogravure plates 
scattered through the volumes ; these reproduce 
examples of Cellini's handiwork, as well as old por- 
traits of himself and his contemporaries. The 
beautiful gold stamping on the covers is an adapta- 
tion from one of Mr. Laurence Housman's desig^ns. 
As for the text, not much needs be said, except that 
the translation given is that of John Addington 
Symonds, — than which there is not now, nor is 
there likely to be, a better. Symonds's extended 
introduction is reprinted in full ; and an introduction 
on Cellini as artist and writer is contributed espe- 
cially for this edition by Mr. Royal Cortissoz. This 
latter is an essay of fine critical quality and dis- 
ci-imination. It dwells particularly on Cellini as an 
artist, and accounts convincingly for the paradox 
presented by the fact of an artist's fame resting 
upon a work of literature rather than upon a work 
of art. Braggart and rascal though Cellini was, his 
unique memoirs will never lose their charm. It is 
a rare pleasure to read them anew in the beautiful 
setting provided by Mr. Updike, and with the fresh 
iUimiination of Mr. Cortissoz' introduction. Bren- 
tano's publish this noteworthy edition. 

As a result of last spring's disaster in San Fran- 
cisco, the enterjjrising publishing house of Paul Elder 
& Co. found it necessary to migrate to the more con- 
venient, if less distinctive, precincts of New York City, 
and it is from thence that this firm's publications for 
the present season issue. The " Elder books " have 
come to occupy so distinct a place in the minds of 
holiday book-buyers, that no apologj' need be offered 
for considering them briefly in a paragi'aph by them- 
selves. Of the " Entirely New Cynic's Calendar for 
1907 " we had something to say in our last issue. Of 
{he other volumes to be considered, first mention must 
be given to " Ye Gardeyne Boke. " a collection of 
quotations about gardens and gardening gathered by 
Jennie Day Haines from the literature of all ages. 
The volume is a large-sized octavo, boimd in green 
clotli, with decorative end-leaves in green and page 
borders by Mr. Spencer Wright. Garden-lovers need 
look no fm-ther for an appropriate gift. — Similar in 
size is Miss Vera Goldthwaite's collection of aphor-

isms from Robert IngersoU, presented in an attrac-

Ingersoll." The pungent quotations are arranged 
under various headings, so that it is possible in a few 
moments to get the gist of Ingersoll's views on any 
main subject of human interest. — In a volume which 
in paper, binding, and illustrations follows a unique 
color-scheme of tropical brown, Mrs. Frank R. Day

the volume taking its title from the first story, " The 
Princess of Manoa. " Ten illustrations, printed in 
sepia and mounted on blank pages throughout the 
book, are contributed by Mr. D. Howard Hitchcock. 
— The five " Mosaic Essays " hitherto published by 
Messrs. Elder in separate booklets have now been 
brought together in a collected edition. The contents 
consist of brief quotations about love, friendship, hap- 
piness, nature, and success, chosen from many authors 
and woven together in appropriate sequence. Decor- 
ative end-leaves and frontispiece, as well as tasteful 
typography and binding, give the volume an unusual 
charm. — The religious flavor is predominant in both 
" Sunday Symphonies, " compiled by Jennie Day 
Haines, and " Fear Not, " arranged by " D. J. D.

of the year." The second consists of " quotations of 
courage from the Holy Bible, followed by inspiring 
thoughts from later sources." Both booklets are no 
less unique than attractive in mechanical make-up.

contained in his famous exclamation. Here are re- 
cipes before which the most obdurate spot must evap- 
orate, and the form of the booklet is dainty enough to 
grace any table. — For younger readers are " The 
Twins and the Whys, " a " fairy tale worth while, " 
by Susan F. Thompson; and two more of "Johnny 
Jones's " inimitable copy-books with " spelling by his 
mother," — the "Book of Nature" and " Wonders 
of the Deep. " 

A stately edition of Franklin's Autobiography, 
produced with all the skill and resources of the 
Riverside Press, commemorates most fittingly this 
year of the two hundredth anniversary of Franklin's 
birth. The volume is a quarto in size, uniform in 
general appearance with the " Life and Death of 
Cardinal Wolsey," issued by the Riverside Press 
last year. There is no pretension of undue elegance 
about the book, yet in every detail its appearance 
satisfies the most critical eye. A baker's dozen of 
portraits in photogravure, and several half-tone 
facsimiles of old pamphlets and documents, make 
up the illustrative features. Of very unusual interest 
is the frontispiece, a fine photogravure reproduction 
of the contemporary portrait of Franklin recently 
presented by Earl Grey to the United States, and 
now hanging upon the White House walls. This 
portrait has not before been reproduced in any book. 
The St. Gaudens medal, struck off in commemora- 
tion of the Franklin bi-centennial, is given in fac- 



simile reproduction on the two covers of the volume, 
the design being deeply embossed in leather and 
inlaid in the board covers, — the obverse side in 
front, the reverse in back. A brief introduction re- 
counts the romantic story of the discovery and pur- 
chase of the original MS. of the autobiography by 
the Hon. John Bigelow in 1867, part of this account 
being told in the sprightly correspondence of 
William H. Huntington, who acted as Mr. Bigelow's 
agent in acquiring the MS. The text follows Mr. 
Bigelow's fifth edition, and is therefore an exact 
reproduction of the original, even to a few mis- 
spellings. 

A unique two-volume edition of " Romola. " issued 
by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., is described on its 
title-page as "historically illustrated," — which means 
that a hundred and sixty engravings of scenes and 
characters have been chosen by the editor. Dr. Guido 
Biagi, librarian of the Laurentian Library at Florence. 
To reproduce the setting of the story and suggest the 
extent and character of the material from which 
George Eliot constructed her wonderful romance. Dr. 
Biagi furnishes an occasional note, and also a twenty- 
five page introduction, explaining his project and 
tracing, by means of the author's diaries and his own 
investigations in the archives of the Magliabecchian 
Library, the stages of her research through the streets 
of the city and the records of its past. Without this 
introduction, many of the illustrations would seem 
supei-fluous ; but after reading it, each one takes its 
place as a contribution, more or less important, to 
the complex fabric of history and tradition with which 
the author's two trips to Florence, in 1860 and 1861, 
equipped her. Dr. Biagi considers this work, in spite 
of its imperfections, "the most classical romance of 
modern English literature. " The illustrations, nearly 
all of which are from photographs specially taken 
for this edition, show panoramas and plans of the old 
city, engravings of Its ancient buildings, some of which 
are now demolished, photographs of its ai"t treasures, 
contemporary portraits of Savonarola and the great 
men of his time, and facsimiles of the author's orig- 
inal manuscript. Sir Frederick Burton's portrait of 
George Eliot forms the frontispiece for this hand- 
some edition of what is her most monumental, though 
perhaps not her greatest, work. 

Discriminating book-lovers have learned to look 
forward each year to the new volumes in the Dent- 
Dutton series of " English Idylls," which combine 
dainty decoration and appropriate and delightful 
illustration with a fine taste in the choice of material 
for reprinting. The new titles this winter are "The 
Household of Sir Thomas More," perhaps the favor- 
ite among Miss Anne Manning's delightful novels, 
and " Christmas at Bracebridge Hall," reprinted 
from "The Sketch Book" and " Bracebridge Hall." 
Both books are illustrated in color by Mr. C. E. 
Brock. Washington Irving's sketches of an old- 
time English Christmas have been reprinted a count- 
less number of times before and often illustrated; 
but Mr. Brock's work is so sympathetic and indi- 
vidual as to lend distinction to this new edition. His

English sei-vants, villages, and children, and the 
Christmas party at the hall, become even more real 
and charming than they were before. The intro- 
duction to this volume presents a brief biogi'aphical 
sketch of Irving, and a graceful tribute to his sym- 
pathetic observation of rural England. The editor 
of Miss Manning's novel has devoted his inti'oduc- 
tion to showing how skilfully she has "transmuted 
and heartened " the history which she found in 
Roper's "Life of Sir Thomas More" and elsewhere, 
preserWng the maximum of historical fidelity, and 
yet mingling enough fancy and imagination to vivify 
the facts and make the people of the history books 
real and living. Mr. Brock's pictures for this volume 
also are singularly successful. King Henry and 
Queen Anne, Sir Thomas, Hans Holbein, and Eras- 
mus, appearing in company with the dainty Marga- 
ret Roper and her little sisters, lose their formal 
historic asjiect and take a more distinct place among 
the dear and delightful people of fiction. Many 
readers will like to make or renew acquaintance 
with Miss Manning's work through the medium of 
this alluring reprint. 

'• Dem Good Ole Times," by Mrs. James H. 
Dooley, is a gaily bound royal octavo, full of tales 
in negro dialect of the glorious days " befo' de war," 
issued by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. Daddy 
Ben. the supposed raconteur, is a sort of second 
Uncle Remus, only that his listener is his little 
black gi'andchUd, and instead of the adventures of 
Brer Rabbit and his friends Daddy Ben tells stories 
of life in the big house — of his master's bi-avery and 
his mistress's goodness and beauty, of the children's 
pranks and the young people's dancing and riding 
and courting, or of the merry-making in the cabins, 
where '" dar was always some kind er frolic on han'. 
Ef tworn't a funeral, twuz a possimi-hunt, less'n 
twuz a prar-meetin', or a dance, — sho' to be one or 
tuther." Accordingly, one of the stories is a "pos- 
sum tale "; another is about a certain famous *• sweet- 
tales times," and stiU others cluster about the " ole- 
tirae Crismus," and the Sunday-school " befo' de 
war " whose battles came very near to the big 
house and add a touch of adventure to several chap- 
ters. All the stories are full of the genuine negro 
humor that sometimes comes so close to pathos. 
Daddy Ben has a fine contempt for " fi'ee niggers," 
and a polite scorn for the mistaken notions enter- 
tained by " Mr. Roosumfeltum un dem folks in 
Washington," which he takes every opportunity to 
vent. Each of the eleven chapters is accompanied 
by a dainty full-page picture in colors, the work of 
Miss Suzanne Gutherz : and each is introduced by 
a decorated title-page and an appropriate heading 
in black-and-white by Miss Cora Parker. 

Whatever previous knowledge we have had of the 
Caradoc Press, situate in Chiswick, London, has been 
based upon " The Acorn," a quarterly miscellany of 
art and literature patterned somewhat upon " The 
Yellow Book," though quite without the decadent 
tendencies of that much-discussed publication. Now, 
however, we have two volumes bearing this imprint 



which make it evident that the Caradoc Press must 
be reckoned with in any account of present-day 
English printing. These volumes, presenting in tJie 
way of text "The Compleat Angler" and "The 
Vicar of Wakefield," are similar in size and general 
appearance. Both are set in the same face of type, 
a modification of the Jenson cut so much in vogue 
with amateur printers. The paper is hand -made, a 
trifle stiff for a small octavo volume, but otherwise 
of excellent quality. No fault may be found with 
the press-work ; and the brown leather binding, 
bearing almost no decoration, is unique and tasteful. 
Etched frontispiece portraits, and several small etch- 
ings in the text of " The Compleat Angler," form a 
distinctive and artistic feature of the books. These 
etchings, together with the decorative borders and 
initials, are the work of Mr. H. George Webb, who 
seems to be the chief jiersonality behind the Press. 
It should be said that both of these reprints follow 
the variable orthography and punctuation of the 
originals, and that they contain no editorial matter 
of any sort. Each edition is limited to 350 copies. 
It would seem that the success of Mr. E. V. 
Lucas's "The Open Road," published some three 
or four years ago, has served to set a new fashion 
in anthologies. Within a fortnight we have re- 
ceived no less than four compilations all modelled 
upon the same pattern ; that is to say, each is a col- 
lection of good verse and prose of all sorts, intended 
as a little }x>cket companion to sustain and pleasm'e 
those who go on pilg^nage — or, as in one of the 
present cases, thase who stay at home in the city. 
One of these books is a new compilation from Mr. 
Lucas's own hand; one is in many ways a better 
book than " The Open Road "; while the other two 
are good collections of their kind, but too obviously 
imitations to be taken vei-j* seriously. Of Mr. Lucas's 
new volume, " The Friendly Town" (Holt), nothing 
but good may be said, although — as is inevitable 
with any anthology — the reader will wish that some 
things had been included in place of some that are 
given. The selections cover a wide range, and many 
of them have but a remote relation to the urban 
spirit in literature; but they all serve Mr. Lucas's 
purpose, and go to make up a volume that should 
find a place imder every reading-lamp. The decora- 
tive cover and end-leaves are unusually attractive. — 
While similar in appearance and genei-al arrange- 
ment to "The Open Roatl," Mr. Quiller-Couch's 
" Tlie Pilgrim's Way " is compiled upon a somewhat 
different plan, its pui-pose being to proi-ide the way- 
farer with good counsel rather than pleasant read- 
ing — though both ends are attained. Uneri'ing 
good taste is evident throughout the collection, as 
might liave been expected from so skUful a hand as 
that which formed "The Oxford Book of English 
Poetry." Not the least of the volume's charms is 
the compiler's fine little prefatory essay ; while the 
details of typography and paper could not well be 
bettered. — The idea of both Mr. W. G. Waters's 
" Traveller's Joy " (Dutton) and Mr. Alfred H. 
Hyatt's " The Footpath Way " (Jacobs) is obviously

based upon " The Open Road "; and the first-named 
book goes so far as exactly to copy the mechanical 
form of Mr. Lucas's volume in practically every 
detail. This is unfortunate, since it will prejudice 
some readers against what are in themselves most 
agreeable little compilations. It is to be noted that 
Mr. Waters has made his selections in large part 
from early and less well-known writers who seldom 
find place in collections of this sort. 

Among a little group of holiday booklets to which, 
as one of them puts it, there is "no admittance 
except on pleasure," first place belongs to " Mis- 
representative Women" (Duffield), in which Mr. 
Harry Graham has dared to do for the fair sex 
what he has already done for " Mere Men," namely, 
describe a few famous characters in humorous verse. 
As Dame Rumor, Mrs. Christopher Columbus, and 
Mrs. Grundy are among the subjects to whom his 
sprightly muse does honor, the reader need fear no 
lack of variety. A few clever illustrations add a 
festive touch to the book. — " The Foolish Almanac, 
2nd " (Luce) shows no falling off from the excellent 
standard of foolishness set by its predecessor of 
last year. There is enough genuine fun between its 
gay covers to provide a good laugh for every day in 
the year, and the pictures by Mr. Wallace Gold- 
smith are no less clever than the text. — '' Over the 
Walnuts and Wine " (Caldwell), by Mr. James 
Clarence Harvey, is shaped to represent a cham- 
pagne bottle reposing in its appropriate bucket of ice. 
While Mr. Harvey's verses and epigrams are a bit 
uneven, they have not a little of the sparkle and 
zest that we naturally look for in such a setting. A 
decorative border in tint surrounds each page, and 
there is a frontispiece. — Something of the cham- 
pagne flavor belongs also to the collection of toasts 
brought together by Miss Idella Phelps in a little 
volume entitled "Your Health!" (Jacobs). A 
charming drawing in red and black, the work of 
Miss Helen Alden Knipe, appears on every other 
page. — " Who 's It in America " (B. W. Dodge & 
Co.) is described on its title-page as " a sort o' 
biography of certain prominent persons, with some 
facts about them hitherto unpublished in a work of 
this nature." It is mildly amusing in general quality. 
— A collection of up-to-date aphorisms of the " self- 
made merchant" variety are to be found in " Senator 
Sorghum's Primer of Politics" (Altemus), by Mr, 
Philander Chase Johnson. Others besides practical 
politicians will derive an occasional good " pointer " 
from these " helpful hints on the science of not 
getting the worst of it." 

A type of gift-book which seems to grow more 
popular every season is that of the brief essay or ser- 
mon, usually by some well-known writer, presented 
in a booklet at once inexpensive in price and elegant, 
often luxurious, in appearance. Among the publi- 
cations of this sort, those of Messrs. Crowell & Co. 
hold first place, for both number and quality. This 
firm's output for the present season, of which it is 
impossible to do much more than give a list of titles 
and authors, includes the following volumes : " The 



World's Christmas Tree," by the Rev. Charles E. 
Jefferson ; " American Character," by Professor 
Brander Matthews; "The Happy Family," by Dr. 
George Hodges ; " Putting the Most into Life," by 
Mr. Booker T. Washington ; " Great Riches," by 
President Eliot of Harvard ; Thoreau's Essay on 
Friendship ; " Tlie Beauty of Kindness," by Rev. 
J. R. Miller ; Dr. Hale's " The Man without a 
Country "; " Saint Francis of Assisi," by Mr. Oscar 
Kuhns ; and " Germelshausen," translated from 
the German of Friedrich Gerstiicker by Clara M. 
Lathrop. All of these vohimes are choicely printed 
in red and black, and several contain photogravure 
frontispieces. Of equal attractiveness with these are 
two volumes from the American Unitarian Associa- 
tion, — "Life's Enthusiasms" by President David 
Starr Jordan, and " The Shepherd's Question " by 
Mr. Burt Pastes Howard ; the l)inding of each of 
these is particularly artistic and pleasing. From 
Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. we have Dr. George 
Hodge's "The Pui'suit of Happiness," and Frank 
Norris's " The Joyous Miracle." Messrs. McClurg 
& Co. send us Mrs. Sara A. Hubbard's "The Re- 
ligion of Cheerfulness," and from the Messrs. Harper 
we have Dr. Henry van Dyke's " The Americanism 
of Washington." Inexpensive as are all the volumes 
mentioned in this paragi'aph, they combine attractive- 
ness of make-up with high quality of text in such 
measure as to render them ideal gift-books of an 
unassuming sort. 

Calendars and year-books are perennial accom- 
paniments of the holiday season. Among this 
autumn's varied selections one of the prettiest and 
most unique is " All the Year in a Garden," a cal- 
endar for nature-lovers, compiled by Miss Esther 
Matson and issued in a dainty and suitable binding 
by Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. Miss Matson 
has hunted her quotations in all sorts of delightful 
nooks and by-ways of nature litei-ature, and her 
gleanings have a distinct flavor of piquancy and 
originality. A photogi'aph of a garden or a flower 
accompanies the quotations for each month — " Daily 
Joy and Daily Peace" (Crowell) contains the gen- 
erous allowance of three or more brief but inspiring 
sentiments for every day in the year. Miss Rose 
Porter is the editor. The little book is daintily 
bound in white and gold, and there are twelve illus- 
trations from famous paintings "A Longfellow 

Calendar" (Crowell) contains extracts, descriptive 
or didactic, from the poems of our favorite Ameri- 
can singer. A beautiful photogravure portrait of 
the poet forms the frontispiece. — Mr. H. B. Metcalf 
has endeavored to produce in " Gems of Wisdom 
for Every Day " (McClurg) a volume not of fami- 
liar, but of unfamiliar quotations. The thoughtful 
reader will approve his selections, which cover a 
wide range of ancient and modern literatm-e. Blue 
page-borders and the checked denim cover with its 
pretty paper label furnish somewhat of a novelty in 
the way of decoration. 

" The Face in the Girandole " is the title of a 
book that will make an ideal present for the friend

who goes in for old furniture. DaintUy bound and 
decorated and prettily illustrated, with an attractive 
touch of romance in its slender plot, it is a novelette 
that almost anybody might like to spend an idle hour 
upon. But the lover of old furniture wUl" gloat over 
it. He wUl recognize in Mr. William Frederick Dix. 
its author, a kindred spirit, with fine appreciation of 
all the subtle joys of the old-furniture fad, including 
an interest in the dealers who cheat you and the 
friends who buy away from you the things you have 
been secretly bargaining for. Such readers will 
criticize Mr. Dix's dogmas about Sheraton and 
Chippendale, add bits out of their own experience 
to his amusing " furniturosophy," sigh regretfully 
that they cannot compete with his hero for the 
treasures in the old house at Mendham, and start 
out forthwith on a determined search for a girandole. 
Mr. Dix has shown a good deal of astuteness in 
choosing his title : collectors who do not know just 
what a girandole is will be particularly eager to read 
his book. ( Moffat. Yard & Co. ) 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Company have fm-- 
nished an unusually sumptuous setting for Mrs. 
Tryphosa Bates Batcheller's " Glimpses of Italian 
Court Life." The dark green cover is heavily dec- 
orated in gold to simulate the clasps used in mediaeval 
book-making. The frontispiece is a photogravure 
portrait of Queen Elena of Italy, to whom the book 
is dedicated by special permission. The other pic- 
tures are half-tones of unusually fine quality, made 
from photographs, and a few water-colors. They in- 
clude views of Rome, Naples, and some other Italian 
cities and villages, and a great many portraits of Mrs. 
Bat<;heller's Roman friends, many signed with a few 
pleasant words of appreciation and friendship by their 
donors. Mrs. BatcheUer has chosen to write her remi- 
niscences of a notable visit to Rome, with brief stops 
on the two journeys through Italy, in the form of 
letters to her mother and father, and to one or two 
intimate friends. The personal note is therefore 
strong, and the narrative is rambling, informal, and 
thoroughly readable. Mrs. BatcheUer does not as- 
sume the office of guide to the wonders of the im- 
perial city. Occasionally she writes of delightful but 
rather perfunctory expeditions *' to see the sights," 
made at the instigation of an indefatigble American 
friend. But more interesting, both to writer and 
reader, are the glimpses of the Roman court and so- 
ciety life, to which Mrs. Batcheller's musical talents 
and social position gave her entrance. She was ac- 
corded the honor of a special presentation to the two 
Queens of Italy, and to the Pope. She went to a court 
ball, met many distinguished Americans and members 
of the diplomatic circle, saw some private theatricals 
in which a princess played the part of '• leading 
lady," attended many splendid: balls during carnival 
week and many notable concerts all through the 
winter, and saw the inner splendors of many lovely 
villas and f aijious palaces. All these novel experi- 
ences she writes of in a sprightly conversational style, 
with an enthusiasm which, although sometimes a little 
overdone, yet adds to the charm of the book. It will - 



appeal especially to those who are interested in the 
musical society of Rome and Paris. 

In the volume entitled " With Byron in Italy " 
(McClm-g), Mrs. Anna B. McMahian deals with 
Byron as she has previously dealt with the Brown- 
ings and with Shelley, — that is to say, she has 
brought together and arranged in logical sequence 
such portions of the poet's verse and letters as are 
associated with his life in Italy. Of all the English 
poets who have adopted Italy as a foster-mother, 
Mrs. McMahan considers that Byron's absorption 
into the country was the most obvious and complete. 
The years of Byron's residence in Italy, from 1816 
to 1823, constituted the ripest and most prolific 
period of his life. It follows, as the compiler sug- 
gests, that the letters and poems here presented form 
perhaps the best material upon which to base an 
individual opinion regarding one who, of all English 
poets, has been most praised and most reviled. A 
distinctive feature of the volume is the series of sixty 
illustrations, reproduced in half-tone from photo- 
grajjlis of Italian art, architecture, and scenery ; these 
throw a vivid illvmaination upon most of the impor- 
tant allusions in the text. Besides the reg^ar edi- 
tion in cloth, Mrs. McMahan's book appears in an 
edition on large paper limited to 250 copies. It is 
this latter that we direct particular attention to here, 
as a gift-book whose attractions are not surpassed 
in their way among the season's publications. The 
text is printed on Italian hand-made paper of fine 
quality, with the illustrations on Japanese vellum. 
The binding is of dark paper boards and vellum 
back, bearing on the front cover a rich Jleur de lys 
design in gold. In all respects the volimie is a con- 
spicuous example of fine bookmaking. 

" The Art of the Dresden Gallery, " by Miss Julia 
de Wolf Addison, is the sixth volume in a handsomely 
illustrated series of guides to the principal galleries 
of Europe, which Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. are pub- 
lishing, and makes Miss Addison's thii-d contribution 
to the series. In plan it is similar to its predecessors ; 
it consists of notes and observations upon a large 
number of the finest paintings, both ancient and mod- 
ern, in the royal collection at Dresden, arranged in 
schools or grouping together the works of one or tvvo 
great mastei-s. In the main, it is possible to adhere 
to this plan and still follow the arrangement of the 
pictures in the gallery, diagrams of which are fur- 
nished the reader. Where deviation from the regular 
route is necessary, the location of the pictures is 
clearly indicated, and every effort is made to render 
a tour through the gallery pleasant and profitable, 
and to save those toilsome searches after inconspicu- 
ously hung masterpieces, which all European travel- 
lers remember to their sorrow. On behalf of the large 
number of art-students who must get their knowledge 
of great paintings from books about them, the ac- 
counts of the pictures are descriptive as well as criti- 
cal and historical, and fifty tinted half-tones illustrate 
the greatest and most characteristic works of the col- 
lection. An interesting history of its formation and 
grovrth serves as introduction to the opening chapter.'

The text furnishes as much detail as the ordinary 
traveller will care for, and he will find it of a more 
manageable and useful sort than that offered by most 
guides and catalogues. The binding is both hand- 
some and durable, and the volume not over-large or 
weighty. 

Miss Esther Singleton's compilations of extracts 
describing various cities and countries or famous ob- 
jects of art and architecture are too familiar to need 
further introduction. This year she has added a work 
upon Rome to the series which already includes vol- 
umes about Paris, London, Venice, Japan, Russia, 
and Holland ; and to her art series, one entitled " His- 
toric Buildings of America." The latter has been 
prepared, so the preface tells as, in response to many 
requests ; and it is sure to prove particularly success- 
ful, since it covers a field comparatively untrodden. 
Miss Singleton uses America in its broadest sense, 
and it is astonishing how much interesting material 
she has gathered. In our own land, our most his- 
toric and most beautiful churches are included, from 
Christ Church in Alexandria to the curious Bee-Hive 
Tabernacle at Salt Lake City. A few typical old- 
time homes are described, several of them closely 
associated with Washington, besides a number of 
forts, many of our national and municipal civic 
buildings, several famous college halls, and two 
monuments. The Palace of Chapultepec, the cathe- 
drals of Mexico and Havana, and the Church of St. 
Anne de Beaupr^ in Canada, have all the picturesque- 
ness of the old-world shrines, and ought to be more 
familiar to Americans than they are. Miss Single- 
ton has shown more than her customary ingenuity 
in unearthing vivid descriptions of the buildings, 
and the book is, as usual, amply illustrated from 
photographs. — The selections in the Roman volume 
not only describe the most famous buildings of the 
city and give glimpses of some of its beautiful envi- 
rons, but also include accounts of ancient Rome, of 
the rise of modern Rome, of social life in the cos- 
mopolitan city, of holy week, the yearly carnival, 
and the weekly rag fair. " Rome Revisited," by 
Mr. Frederic Harrison, is the final selection — a sort 
of summary of all the multiform impressions that 
have preceded it. The volume will make an excel- 
lent guide-book for tourists, and those who have not 
seen Rome and do not expect to see it will enjoy 
the vivid and interesting descriptions and gain much 
comprehensive information, well distributed between 
topography, history, architectiu-e, and manners and 
customs. The illustrations are many and excellent.

In " The Story of Pocahontas and Captain John 
Smith, " told and pictured by Mr. E. Boyd Smith, 
that delightful colorist has abandoned clever farce 
to enter the higher domains of semi-historical por- 
traiture. In a series of twenty-six colored plates, full 
of spirit and beauty, and not without sly touches of 
humor at the expense of everybody concerned, he 
has portrayed the various episodes in the stirring 
story of our first international romance. As usual, 
the drawings are accompanied by very brief textual 



comments. The pictures are bound up in a thin 
quarto, with one of Mr. Smith's designs inset on the 
cover, and specially decorated end-papers and title- 
page. Mr. Smith's style is unique ; all pliases of it 
get full play in the new volume, and his particular 
genius for animal drawings loses nothing by being 
relegated to the corners of the pictures. Indeed the 
drollery of Mr. Smith's corners is always the most 
delightful feature of his work. Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. publish the book, with typography and 
color-work well up to their customary high standard. 

" The Dogs of War," Mr. Walter Emanuel tells 
us, was the greatest dogs' club in the largest city in 
the world. All its members were mongrels except 
Mr. Emanuel's own dog, a thoroughbred field 
spaniel, whose friendship with a neighbor's nonde- 
script cur, known to his admiring followers as the 
Captain, led to the admission of this one aristocrat 
into the Captain's club. " The Dogs of War " were 
pledged to attack at sight all thoroughbreds who gave 
themselves airs or offered insult to plebian canines. 
Naturally "Ears," as the Captain named his aristo- 
cratic friend, had more battles to fight than any other 
member, for all mongrels hated him and all thorough- 
breds looked upon him as a traitor. But his courage 
and liis admiration for the Captain, — who seems to 
have been as unworthy the adulation lavished upon 
him as many hvmian heroes, — never faltered ; and 
when the Captain died he grew suddenly old and 
spiritless — and fell to writing his memoirs. Mr. 
Emanuel allows "Ears " to tell his story exactly as he 
pleases, even though he has included some scathing 
remarks about his master's " silly ways." His great- 
est failing as a raconteur is his lack of humor ; but 
his artistic collaborator, Mr. Cecil Aldin, does his 
best to atone for this by making a great many very 
funny pictures of the " Dogs of War," their friends 
and their foes. 

A volimae of " Prose You Ought to Know " 
(Revell) has been edited by Mr. John R. Howard 
with an intelligence and originality that will make 
it acceptable even to the avowed enemy of the ordi- 
nary book of extracts. Mr. Howard has had a wide 
experience in the work of compilation. His aim in 
the present volume is to gather, from a wide range 
of authorship and subject-matter, a series of brief 
excerpts, each of which shall be typical of its au- 
thor's best style, and, besides exciting a momentary 
interest, shall " at least hint at the richness of an 
essay, a tale, a history, an oration." The selections 
are longer than mere aphorisms, being from one to 
four pages in length. They are chosen with refer- 
ence to a quality that many compilers do not under- 
stand, — namely, a really fine and forceful style. 
Milton, Sydney Smith, Henry Clay, Lowell, Bulwer 
Ly tton, Kane, Sterne, Thackeray, and Gough, among 
the seventy-five names in the table of contents, will 
suggest the somewhat unusual variety of fare which 
the book offers. Each selection is preceded by a 
pithy paragraph of biographical data. Colored mar- 
ginal borders and a pretty cover give the air of 
festivity which most people demand in books of

mas giving. 

" The Swarm," — the subject of the most fascinat- 
ing and dramatic portion of Maurice Maeterlinck's 
marvellous study of " The Life of the Bee," — is the 
title of a little booklet decorated by Mr. Anthony 
Euwer and published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
The separation of these chapters from their setting 
seems fuUy justified, for the author's splendid phi- 
losophy and careful observation are no less evident 
in this portion of the book than in the whole ; and 
these chapters will serve to introduce " The Life of 
the Bee" to many persons who have missed the 
pleasure of reading it hitherto because they do not 
discriminate between M. Maeterlinck and the aver- 
age modern nature-writer, whose emphasis is quite 
different and less to their taste. The cover is ap- 
propriately and not too lavishly decorated. The 
colored designs which underlie the type are so sub- 
dued as not to interfere with easy reading, and they 
have the right tone to harmonize with the essayist's. 
Altogether this is one of the choicest of the season's 
bibelots. 

Those who ai-e famUiar with Mr. Sidney Lee's 
scholarly and readable work, " Stratford-on-Avon," 
will be glad to learn of the new edition issued by 
the Lippincott Company. Mr. Lee has revised his 
text to bring it strictly up to date, and has added 
considerable information which historical researches 
since 1890 have brought to light. Three years ago 
Mr. Lee was chosen chairman of their executive 
committee by the Trustees of Shakespeare's Birth- 
place, so that his acquaintance with the town and 
its memories is even more intimate, and his interest 
greater, than when his book was first published. 
Among the mass of modern Shakespeariana, which 
grows vaster with every publishing season, it is a 
relief to find one book on Stratford that deals with 
the town for its own rather than for the great poet's 
sake. This picturesque account of Stratford's early 
history, — its old markets and fairs, its nobility, its 
gmld, its village sports and industries, — serves not 
only to make a setting for the life of Shakespeare, 
but also to bring out much that, having nothing to 
do with him, is nevertheless quaint and characteristic 
in the most popular pilgrimage-place in all England. 
The new edition is adequately and pleasingly 
illustrated, chiefly by Messrs. Herbert RaUton and 
Edward Hull, and very tastefully boimd. 

"The Story of the Bible" (Winston), by Rev. 
Dr. Jesse L. Hurlbut, well known to visitors to 
Chautauqua and readers of "The Sunday-school 
Times," is meant to be put into the hands of older 
children, and to be used by parents who find it dijBfi- 
cult to tell Bible stories effectively, in instructing 
children too young to read the book for themselves. 
It contains seven hundred and fifty pages, on which 
one hundred and sixty-eight complete stories, each 
independent of the rest, but all together forming 
the continuous Bible history, are told. The lan- 
guage is simple, direct, and wherever possible bib- 
lical. Hard words are explained, doctrines and 



moral applications not found in the original avoided, 
and no imaginary scenes or conversations interpo- 
lated. There is certainly a perennial demand for a 
book of this sort, and it would be hard to find a 
wiser, more tactfid, or more skilful adapter than Dr. 
Hurlbut proves himself. The numerous illustrations, 
which include a few colored plates and nearly three 
hundred half-tones, will undoubtedly be a decided 
attraction in the eyes of young readers. 

A notable edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's 
"■ Tales from Shakespeare " comes in two volumes, 
bound in green cloth with tasteful gold stamping, 
with Brentano's imprint. The two frontispieces are 
authors' portraits ; and the illustrations, one to each 
of the twenty plays, are photogravure reproductions 
of engra^'ings from the paintings of Reynolds, Mac- 
lise, Sir John Gilbert, Snirke, Ilbetson, WestaU, and 
others. The quaintness and spirit of the designs will 
appeal more strongly to adult than to youthful read- 
ers, as will the introduction, from the pen of IVIr. 
Alfred Ainger and bearing the date 1878. But, as 
Mr. Ainger points out, when a genius writes for 
children it is inevitable that children of a larger 
growth shall also like his work. 

'• The Happy-Go-Lucky " is one of those delightful 
German romances, lying in the middle distance be- 
tween fairy-land and this workaday world of ours, 
for which the German nation seems to have a pecu- 
liar genius. Many years ago, ALis. A. L. Wister 
translated this story from the German of Joseph 
Freiherr von Eichendorff ; and now the Lippincott 
Company publish a new edition in holiday dress. 
The illustrations in color and tint by Philipp Grot 
Johann and ProfessorEdmund Kanoldt reproduce 
the quaint foreign atmosphere of the story- ; and the 
marginal drawings by Mrs. Eva Nagel Wolf are 
iUiistrative as well as decorative. Many readers will 
enjoy these "leaves from the life of a good-for- 
nothing " in their new garb. 

Four of Hawthorne's delightful stories of the old 
Province House in Boston have been gjrouped under 
the general title " In Colonial Days," copiously 
illustrated by Mr. Frank C. Merrill, ornately bound, 
and published with the imprint of Messrs. L. C. 
Page & Co. Hawthorne's pellucid style is suffi- 
ciently picturesque to prove of infinite suggestive- 
ness to an artist, and Mr. Merrill's pictures, redo- 
lent of old times and customs, and yet full of life 
and spirit, are evidently the fruits of congenial and 
sympathetic effort. Anybody would enjoy the Tales 
in their new setting, which ought, however to prove 
particularly acceptable to younger readers. 

If one has entered on his list of friends an epi- 
cure for whom some holiday remembrance must be 
provided, nothing more fitting could be found than 
the two companion volimies, " Louis's Salads and 
Chafing Dishes " and " Louis's IVIixed Drinks " 
(Caldwell). The author is Mr. Louis Muckensturm, 
a chef of long experience, and it is his genial (if not 
intellectual) face that looks out upon us from the 
frontispiece of each volimie. The recipes of which 
the books are composed look well in print, and the

form of the volumes is refreshingly removed from 
conventional cook-book ugliness. 

Sumptuously bound in limp ooze leather, with 
page-borders whose swirling lines and suggestive 
symbolism, printed in a shade to harmonize pleas- 
antly with the cover, make an attractive frame for 
the text, the "Love Poems" of Lord Byron are as 
elegant a piece of book-making as one could wish. 
Whether or not Byronic love is still sufficiently in 
fashion to justify so luxurious a reprint is an inter- 
esting question which the reviewer is not called upon 
to settle. But it would be difficult to imagine a more 
harmonious and effective setting for these mellifluous 
lyrics than has now been provided by the publishers 
of this little volume. (The H. M. Caldwell Co.) 

Since some of the illustrations for Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons' holiday edition of " The Last Ride 
Together " are so good, it is a pity that others should 
be lacking in both appropriateness and artistic merit. 
In attempting to illustrate one of Browning's strongest 
and most beautiful love lyrics, Mr. Frederick Simpson 
Coburn has set himself an heroic task ; but several of 
his pictures, which are effectively printed in sepia on 
parchment-finished paper, show spirit, suggestiveness, 
and a real gift of imagination. 

Quite the daintiest volume we have seen this 
season is a selection from the " Lyrists of the Resto- 
ration," ma4e by John Constance Masefield, and 
published by the Frederick A. Stokes Co. in a new 
series called " The Chapbooks." In its chaste white 
vellum binding, tied with white leather thongs, this 
diminutive volume suggests somewhat those products 
of the early printers which so warm the collector's 
heart. The selections seem to have been made with 
discrimination, and there is an interesting introduc- 
tory essay. 



Notes. 



Shakespeare's " The Tempest," edited by Professor 
Sidney C. Newsom, is a new " Pocket Classic " published 
by the Macmillan Co. 

" La\<rns and How to Make Them," by Mr. Leonard 
Barron, appears in the " Garden Library " of Messrs. 
Doubleday, Page & Co. 

"A Bodleian Guide for Visitors," by Mr. Andrew 
Clark, is a small book, with many pictures, published 
by Mr. Henry Frowde at the Oxford Clarendon Press. 

" The Preliminary Geography " of Dr. A. J. Herbert- 
son is the first and simplest of a series of "Oxford 
Geographies " in course of publication by Mr. Henry 
Frowde. 

Among the manuscripts left by Thomas Davidson were 
included a course of six lectures ou " Tfie Philosophy 
of Goethe's Faust," and these, edited by Davidson's lit- 
erary legatee, Mr. Charles M. Bakewell, are now put 
into book form by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Mr. Thomas Wright, an industrious biographer known 
through his volumes on Cowper, FitzGerald, and Sir 
Richard Burton, has prepared a Life of Walter Pater, 
which Messrs. Putnam's Sons will publish at once. It 
will occupy two octavo volumes, with a generous supply 
of illustrations. 



De Quincey's " Autobiography " and " Confessions," 
edited by Mr. Tighe Hopkins, is a new volume of the 
" Caxton Thin Paper Classics," imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner. 

" The Friendly Year," published by Messrs. Scrib- 
ner's Sons, is a day-book of selections, in prose and 
verse, from the pleasant writings of the Rev. Henry 
van Dyke. 

The revision of Baedeker goes on forever. The 
latest volume is " Northern Italy " in its thirteenth re- 
modelled edition, and the Messrs. Scribner import it 
for the American market. 

A translation, by Mr. Charles Conner Hayden, of Mile. 
Arv^de Barine's " Alfred de Musset," is presented 
in dignified typographical dress to " subscribers only " 
by the Edwin C. Hill Co. 

" A Sentiment in Verse for Every Day in the Year " 
is an " ethical year book " compiled by Mr. Walter L. 
Sheldon, and publishd by Mr. S. Burns Weston. The 
title of the pamphlet is self-explanatory. 

A revised edition, published at a lower price than 
heretofore, of Mr. A. B. de Guerville's " New Egypt " 
comes to us from Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. It is an 
interesting book and attractively illustrated. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish " A Text-Book 
of Hydraulics," by Professor L. M. Hoskins. It is a 
work for students in technical schools, and includes 
among its features an outline of the theory of turbines. 

Professor George Rice Carpenter's " English Gram- 
mar," published by the Macmillan Co., is a largely 
rewritten form of the " Principles of English Grammar " 
prepared by the author nearly ten years ago. It is a 
typical high-school text of the best modern sort. 

Wentworth Smith's " The Hector of Germaine, or 
the Palsgrave Prime Elector," a little-known play of the 
early seventeenth century, is reprinted from the rare 
quarto of 1615, with editorial matter by Mr. Leonidas 
W. Payne, Jr., and published by the University of 
Pennsylvania. 

" Forty Lessons in Physics," by Mr. Lynn B. Mc- 
MuUen, is a class-room text remarkable for the profu- 
sion of its diagrams. In fact, every right-hand page is 
given up to some sort of graphic material illustrative 
of the text which faces it. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
are the publishers. 

" A Rhetoric and Composition," the work of Pro- 
fessor Edward Fulton, is among the latest educational 
publications of Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The author 
does not claim that he has made a book better than the 
others of its kind, but merely the book that represents 
his personal methods of teaching and the needs of his 
own classes. 

" What 's Next; or, Shall a Man Live Again?" is the 
flippant and catchy title of a compilation of opinions 
upon the subject of personal immortality, compiled by 
Miss Clara Spalding Ellis. It includes letters from 
over a hundred well-known writers, besides extracts 
from many books, and a selection of poems. It is pub- 
lished by Mr. Richard G. Badger. 

" Outlines for the Study of Biblical History and Lit- 
erature," by Dr. Frank Knight Sanders and Dr. Henry 
Thatcher Fowler, is a recent publication of Messrs 
Charles Scribner's Sons. It is practically a syllabus, 
with references and bibliography, of the subject with 
which it deals, and will furnish students with a valuable 
guide to the literature of the higher criticism.

The Messrs. Brentano reprint Mr. G. B. Shaw's 
" Three Plays for Puritans," making the third volume 
of the collected plays. The titles are "The Devil's 
Disciple," " Ceesar and Cleopatra," and " Captain 
Brassboimd's Conversion." The preface of 1900 is 
gfiven with the plays. 

" The Romances of Chivalry in Italian Verse," pub- 
lished by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., is a stout volume 
of annotated selections from the texts of Pulci, Boiardo, 
Ariosto, and Tasso. The editorial work, including an 
introduction, is done by Professor J. D. M. Ford and 
Miss Mary A. Ford. 

" Heroes of European History," by Miss Louise 
Creighton, offers children an introduction to world- 
history, from the ancient Greeks to the modern Ger- 
mans. It would make an excellent supplementary 
reader for elementary schools. The book is published 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" Dalton's Complete Bridge," published by the Fred- 
erick A. Stokes Co., is a treatise which leaves notliing to 
be desired on the score of thoroughness. Mr. Dalton 
is the foremost of English authorities on the subject, and 
may fairly be styled the Cavendish of this perverted 
form of the noble game of whist. 

Mr. Gosse's " Short History of Modern English Lit- 
erature," first published in the " Literatures of the 
World " series, is now reissued by the Frederick A. 
Stokes Co. in illustrated form. The illustrations are 
portraits, and there are no less than seventy-two of 
them. A few revisions have also been made in the text. 

Mr. Percy Mackaye's " Jeanne d'Arc," just now be- 
ing presented upon the stage, is published in book form 
by the Macmillau Co.. The author is one of the most 
promising of our younger dramatists, and the present 
work offers a dignified and poetic treatment of one of 
the noblest of all possible themes. Such publications 
are among the most welcome signs of the times. 

" Longmans' Historical Series for Schools " consists of 
three volumes for as many grades of students, based 
upon what is felicitously styled the "concentric sys- 
tem." They are the work of Professor T. F. Tout. 
The series is now completed by the publication of the 
third volume, " An Advanced History of Great Britain," 
a volume of over seven hundred pages, with many maps 
and plans. 

Two big books and two little ones are added to the 
" Standard English Classics " of Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
The former are " Ivanhoe," edited by Mr. W. D. Lewis, 
and Lorna Doone," edited by Professors W. P. Trent 
and W. P. Brewster. The latter are " The Rape of the 
Lock and Other Poems," edited by Professor T. M. 
Parrott, and " Selections from Browning," edited by 
Professor Robert M. I^ovett.

470 THE DIAL, [Dec. 16, 



KEEPIKGiUP WITH THE MAGAZINES 

without giving all one's time to them is a task of ever-increasing 
difficulty. €LThis is decidedly the magazine age. The number, 
variety, and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than 
amazing. The master-minds of the world go to their making, — the 
greatest of living thinkers, workers, story-tellers, poets, and artists. 
One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch 
with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast 
is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand. By limiting 
oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year, all but a very small 
portion of the field is overlooked. C.The only sensible plan is to 
buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the 
things one wants most to see. This plan has been made practicable by 
What's in the Magazines, a monthly publication which renders the 
mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy 
every-day reader. Each issue presents a bird's-eye view of the maga- 
zine-contents of the month, with the aid of which one may gain in 
ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as 
though he had personally examined a copy of each. C. It is not a mere 
list of contents; neither is it a complicated and confusing library 
index. Everything is arranged and classified, simply but exactly; 
whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ- 
ers or merely looking out for good things in general, the arrangement 
is equally convenient. C. It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine- 
land, — a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell; 
and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person.
