ALPHONSE DA UDET. 

French literature could ill afford to spare the 
graceful pen of Alphonse Daudet. Within five 
years it has lost in Renan its greatest prosateur 
in the domain of scholarship, in Taine its great- 
est philosophical historian, in Leconte de 
Lisle its greatest poet, and now in Alphonse 
Daudet its greatest novelist. This does not 
mean that Daudet was a great novelist in the 
sense of Hugo or Balzac, or even of Stendhal 
or Flaubert, but simply that among the writers 
of fiction left living during the past fifteen years 
he was clearly the most important, and that we 
may scan the horizon of dawning reputations in 
vain for indications of any other likely to occupy 
as large a place in the literature of the Republic. 
His success was hardly and honorably won, and 
his career was that of a typical man of letters. 
The story of his obscure origin, of his early 
struggles for a livelihood, of his eventual recog- 
nition, of his constantly growing reputation 
and the golden sunset of his assured fame, is of 
the old sort so familiar to the student of literary 
history, although one not often to be read in 
books so charming as those in which Daudet has 
himself told it in " Le Petit Chose," to begin 
with, and later in " Trente Ans de Paris," and 
the " Souvenirs d'un Horn me de Lettres." 

Daudet was a Provencal by birth, and saw 
the light at Nimes in 1840. His boyhood was 
spent in his native city and in Lyons. He then 
obtained a position as usher in a country school, 
but a year of this drudgery was all that he could 
bear, and at the age of seventeen he started to 
seek his fortune in Paris. From this time until 
the War of 1870, he struggled to gain a foot- 
hold in the world of letters, receiving support 
for a time from a clerical position in the civil 
service, and finding happiness in marriage with 
the talented woman who has ever since remained 
his devoted companion and counsellor. His first 
book was " Les Amoureuses," a volume of love 
poems. Other collections of verse followed, and 
quickly won for the young writer a reputation. 
He also essayed the drama, producing nine 
plays in all, besides the later dramatizations of 
his novels. His plays had no great success, and 
their titles convey little to the average theatre- 
goer or reader of dramatic literature. 

These tentative efforts in the lyric and dra- 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



matic provinces of literature were supplemented 
by journalistic work done for " Le Figaro " and 
other papers, and in this work we find the 
sketches and short stories in which Daudet's 
true artistic self was first revealed. " Le Petit 
Chose," that exquisite fragment of autobiog- 
raphy, dates from 1868, and before the annee 
terrible he had also produced the charming 
" Lettres de Mon Moulin." When the war 
was over, his position as the greatest master of 
the short story was still further strengthened 
by the " Contes du Lundi," the " Contes et 
Recits," and other collections. The best of 
these pieces are the purest gems of their sort in 
modern French literature. Equal in perfec- 
tion of form to the stories of Maupassant they 
have a substance which the stories of the later 
master rarely exhibit, and the pathos of such 
studies as "La Derniere Classe " and "Le Siege 
de Berlin " is wellnigh flawless. He is indeed 
to be pitied who can read with dry eyes these 
masterpieces in miniature. The short stories 
gave to their author just the sort of training 
in the niceties of literary art that was needed 
to develop his powers as a full-grown novelist, 
and enable him to produce, during the follow- 
ing quarter-century, the series of fiction that 
gave him an unrivaled position among the 
French novelists of his time. Other works were 
written in this later period, but they are of 
minor importance rechauffes or chips from a 
literary workshop and reveal no development 
of power beyond what was displayed when 
Daudet the novelist was yet artistically unborn. 
The first of Daudet's books written de longue 
haleine was the famous " Tartarin deTarascon," 
dated 1872. In this book and its two succes- 
sors, " Tartarin sur les Alpes " (1886), and 
" Port-Tarascon " (1890), he achieved his 
greatest title to literary fame, for these three 
works projected into literature one of its few 
immortal types of character. The creation of 
Tartarin stands only just below such figures as 
Falstaff and Sancho Panza. The intensely 
human figure of Daudet's lion-hunter, mountain- 
climber, and colonial adventurer is a fascinat- 
ing study in all three phases of his self-glorious 
career ; all the color of the midi glows from 
the pages in which his exploits are set forth, 
and all the humorous or lovable foibles of the 
Provengal are delineated with a touch that is 
incisive without being painful, with a geniality 
that robs satire of its sting, and finds in happy 
and wholesome laughter a universal solvent for 
the most varied sentiments and emotions. What- 
ever else may be forgotten, the story of Tartarin 



will be remembered, and will remain among the 
classics of nineteenth century literature. 

The greater part of Daudet's career as a 
novelist was, however, devoted to the production 
of studies of modern life which have made him 
the chief interpreter of the second imperial and 
third republican periods of French society. 
They do not, it is true, present us a delineation 
comparable for minute observation and com- 
prehensiveness with the record of the restora- 
tion period that is made in the forty volumes 
of the " Comedie Humaine," for not every age 
can produce a Balzac, but they do provide us 
with a series of careful studies wherein much 
of recent French life is pictured, and which 
have a charm of style that was beyond the 
reach of Daudet's great predecessor. Two or 
three of these books are comparatively insig- 
nificant, but at least eight of them are master- 
pieces in a very genuine sense. They are, in 
the order of their publication, " Froment Jeune 
et Risler Aine " (1874), "Jack " (1876), "Le 
Nabab" (1878), "Rois en Exil" (1879), 
"Numa Roumestan " (1880), " L'Evangeliste " 
(1883), " Sapho " (1884), and "L'Immortel " 
(1888). These books are, on the whole, the 
most remarkable collection of novels produced 
by any Frenchman under the Third Republic. 

Space fails us in which to characterize in any 
detail this series of drames parisiens. They 
are all well-known to English readers, for they 
have been promptly translated as they have 
appeared. The first of them (called " Sidonie " 
in the English version) was, we remember, 
made the subject of considerable cheap moral- 
izing when it appeared in our language, with 
the natural consequence that it became widely 
known. Much water has flowed under the 
bridges since then, and so many writers using 
the English language have bettered whatever 
instruction in immorality was to be derived 
from the literature of France that " Sidonie " 
would now be considered very mildly offensive 
even by the self-constituted professional guar- 
dians of our literary virtue. Daudet has some- 
times been called the French Dickens, an 
ascription which is merely absurd if based 
upon any comparison between the humor, say, 
of the "Tartarin " books and of "Pickwick," but 
which has some slight justification if referred 
to the pathos of " Jack," that poignant narra- 
tive whose chief fault is its excessive length. 
Daudet's third novel, " Le Nabab," is probably 
his masterpiece, although this claim may per- 
haps be contested by the partisans of " Numa 
Roumestan " or of " Sapho." The book is a 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



brilliant picture of Parisian life under the Sec- 
ond Empire, and it portrays the corruption of 
that period with an unsparing brush, although 
the figure of Mora is delineated with a more 
kindly hand than actual history warrants a 
fact easily explained when we remember that 
he is no other than the Due de Morny, whom 
the novelist served as a secretary for a number 
of years. This figure and that of Numa 
Roumestan (who is Gambetta somewhat more 
disguised) are. the most conspicuous illustra- 
tions of the novelist's habit of introducing 
prominent public characters into his fictions. 
The " Rois en Exil " is a gallery of such figures, 
and if the " Astier-Rehu " of " L'Immortel " is 
not any particular academician, there are not a 
few who might have found themselves more or 
less caricatured in him. Something ought to 
be said about " Sapho," yet a few words would 
be less adequate than none at all. The inscrip- 
tion " pour mes fils quand ils auront vingt ans " 
indicates that the work is not milk for babes or 
food for bread-and-butter misses, and shows also 
how large a question any discussion of such a 
book must raise. From the technical stand- 
point of literary art " Sapho " is as nearly per- 
fect as anything that the author ever wrote. 

The literary characteristics of Daudet are 
admirably outlined by Professor B. W. Wells, 
upon whose " Modern French Literature " we 
have relied for many of the dates and other 
matters of fact given in the present sketch. We 
are told that " to the naturalistic temper he 
brought the mind of an idyllic poet," that rather 
than " architectural power " he had " the style 
of an impressionist painter." The resulting 
product " attains the highest effects of art with- 
out artificiality, and is at once classical and 
modern." These formulae serve fairly well to 
express the essence of Alphonse Daudet's work 
and to record the residual impression left by 
many years of acquaintance with his varied 
books of fiction. 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, Dec. 20, 1897. 

We have been much exercised during the past week 
with long discussions on the Report issued by the Society 
of Authors. Your readers may not appreciate what this 
means. I will therefore, with your permission, explain 
the matter as clearly as I am able. In this country, most 
books are retailed to the public, by the booksellers, at a 
discount of three pence in the shilling, or about six cents 
to the quarter dollar. For some years past the book- 
sellers have been complaining to the publishers that the 
giving of this discount leaves a margin of profit insuffi- 



cient to pay their working expenses. Their agitation 
resulted in the formation of a Booksellers' Association, 
and the establishment of a similar organization of Pub- 
lishers. After many proposals, it was decided by these 
two bodies that the discount to the public should be 
lowered to two pence; and the publishers, before they 
finally took steps to see that the booksellers did not under- 
sell each other, sought the cooperation of a society which 
has Mr. Rider Haggard for its President, and which calls 
itself the Society of Authors. This body took some time 
to consider the matter, and in the end issued a very pom- 
pous and ambitious pronouncement against the scheme. 
One of the most important statements made in this re- 
port runs thus : " The independence of the author would 
be seriously compromised by the existence of a close ring 
of publishers and booksellers, who might as easily dictate 
to him a royalty of five per cent, as to the bookseller a 
2d. discount." 

What the Society of Authors has done in the past has 
been excellently well told in the chapter devoted to its 
workings which Mr. 6. H. Putnam has included in his last 
edition of " Authors and Publishers." But this much 
it is necessary to say, to arrive at a proper understand- 
ing of the situation: that the Society can in no sense be 
said to represent the large body of English authors. 
The signatories to the Report itself include but three 
writers who might be affected by the scheme; the other 
five are gentlemen of hardly any note in the literary 
world, eminent as they may be in their particular pro- 
fessions. The Society and its organ, "The Author" 
(conducted by Sir Walter Besant), have always gone on 
the assumption that the author is the novelist, and from 
this it has drawn some of the most ridiculous conclusions. 
As a matter of fact, the Society has nothing whatever 
to do with the " booksellers' grievance, "and ought never 
to have been consulted. The publishers have found out 
this error of theirs, and many of them are regretting the 
step they took. 

The trouble, so far as the booksellers are concerned, 
is accentuated by the fact that drapers have taken to 
selling books at cutting prices. If publishers would but 
resist the temptation to " jobbing " large quantities, this 
might not happen. But then, how can we give the 
booksellers all our sympathy, when we find so many of 
them who have never appreciated what it means to sell 
books ? The books they sell are so much goods, or 
" stuff," and it is a rare chance that one comes across a 
really intelligent and well-educated bookseller. 

Next to this " booksellers' grievance " we have been 
interested in the selling of rare books the library of 
the Earl of Ashbnrnham. The past six days have fur- 
nished columns of reports in the daily press of the enor- 
mous prices these books have realized. The first portion 
of this library was disposed of last July, and realized 
the sum of almost 32,000, or 8160,000. The second 
and smaller portion, just dispersed, has brought in nearly 
19,000, or 95,000. Without a doubt the high prices 
are due to the reputation of the library, and to the 
handsome commissions your countrymen have sent over. 
Let me give a few instances : George Gascoigne's "Whole 
Workes" (1587), a book which rarely fetches more 
than 20, found a purchaser for 40; Glanvelk's " De 
Proprietatibns Rerum," printed by Wyukyn de Worde, 
is undoubtedly a very uncommon work, but 195 is also 
an uncommon price. An imperfect copy of Caxton's 
edition of Gower's " Confessio Amantis" (1483) was 
knocked down for 188, and the second edition, from 
the press of Berthelot, for 20. A fine copy of Graf-

ton's Chronicles of Englande " (1570) went for 70, 
while the edition of Hakluyt's Voyages, with the rare 
map and the original suppressed leaves, was bought for 
$1,375. An unusual price for John Hey wood's "The 
Spider and the Flie " is $182, but this is what Mr. 
Quaritch gave for it. In printed " Books of Hours " 
the library was especially rich, and copies brought such 
prices as $300, $705, $895, $525, $825, $595. For 
a magnificent copy of " Heures," printed in 1525 by 
"Maistre Geofry Tory," Mr. Quaritch gave $4,300. 
Mr. Richard Heber's copy of the first edition (Rouen, 
1488) of the famous romance, "Lancelot du Lac," 
fetched $670; the 1494 edition, printed upon vellum, 
realized $375. An early and very rare work on Florida, 
Laudonniere's " Notable Historic, containing Foure 
Voyages . . . unto Florida " (1587), was purchased by 
Mr. Stevens for $1,950. Caxtou's translation of Le 
Fevre's " Recueill of the Historyes of Troye," and 
printed by him about 1472 or 1474, was sold for $4,750; 
the copy wanted 49 leaves, and was purchased by its 
late owner at Mr. E. V. Utterson's sale. The same 
author's " Boke of the Hoole Lyf of Jason," and printed 
by the same printer, circa 1477, reached the substantial 
amount of $10,500. It is quite perfect, and is remark- 
able in that it has rough edges. I might take up the 
whole of your space with items of similar interest and 
rarity; but I have given sufficient to indicate that book- 
collecting has not lost its fascination, and that there must 
be many ardent book-lovers who consider money no 
equivalent for the joy obtained in the possession of a 
rare specimen of printing or a rare edition of a classic. 

So far as the literary world is concerned, I cannot 
report much. The reviews on Mr. Le Gallienne's per- 
petration of a version of Omar Khayyam have afforded 
much amusement to that gentleman's enemies, and prob- 
ably no little chagrin to his friends. He is unfortunate 
lately; but I am afraid he must blame himself for 
giving others an impression that is certainly not nice, 
and that probably may not be true. I hear that he is 
to pay the United States a visit shortly, for the purpose 
of an extended lecturing tour. If you like him you will 
be in love with him; if you dislike him, you'll feel it 
" strong." 

We are about to have two new translations of Omar 
Khayyam one from Mr. E. Heron- Allen, a gentleman 
fairly well-known here for his interest in violins; the 
other from Mr. John Payne, the translator of the Villon 
Society's edition of the " Arabian Nights." The latter 
will probably find many purchasers; and as the edition 
is to be limited, and published under the auspices of the 
society for which Mr. Payne has done such yeomen ser- 
vice, it may be taken for granted that there will not be 
many copies going a-begging. I may also announce 
that there is to be issued in the coming spring a volume 
dealing with the bibliography of the translations of 
Omar's Rubaiyat. In this connection, I think, all praise 
should be accorded to Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, whose 
variorum edition of the quatrains of the poet tent-maker 
of Naishapur is one of the most excellent specimens of 
works of its kind. A few copies have managed to find 
their way here, despite the vigilant eyes of the post- 
office and custom authorities, and, I need hardly say, 
they are much prized. 

I have noticed one or two copies on sale here of Mr. 
Irving Browne's " In the Track of the Book- Worm," a 
volume which has been issued by the Roycrof t Printing 
Shop of East Aurora, N. Y., U. S. A. The book is ap- 
preciated for its unusual printing and general " get-up." 



Mr. Browne is also to be congratulated on his interest- 
ing causeries. 

Talking of the Roycroft Printing Shop reminded me 
of " The Philistine," which in its turn reminded me of 
" The Bibelot," and this again of Mr. Mosher of Port- 
land, Maine. You can have hardly any idea of how 
sore many people here feel against Mr. Mosher. Mr. 
Andrew Lang started the crusade against him for pirat- 
ing " Ballads and Lyrics of Old France " and " Helen 
of Troy." But since the reprint of Mr. Pater's " Essays 
from the Guardian," indignation has risen very high 
indeed. A correspondent in " Literature " can with 
difficulty restrain himself. Of course, it is unfortunate, 
but one can hardly blame Mr. Mosher for doing what he 
does. He finds a certain condition of things and takes 
advantage of them that is all. Somehow, I feel that 
the authors whom Mr. Mosher annexes owe him a vote 
of thanks for the engaging dress in which he clothes 
them. Were I the author of " Helen of Troy," it would 
charm me not a little to see the poem so prettily dis- 
played on hand-made paper and soft parchment. If 
one is stopped on the highway, one would rather hand 
one's purse over to a courteous knight than to the rough- 
and-ready bludgeoner. I do not mean by this that 
Mr. Mosher stops anyone on the highway it is the 
fault of my comparison but that Mr. Mosher has had 
the good taste to handle his gentlemen with care and 
attention. Let them thank their good stars that they 
have fallen into hands so solicitous for their well-being. 
In the matter of good printing, good paper, and pretty 
binding, I art of opinion that the gentleman from Port- 
land, Maine, can teach a lesson or two even to London 
publishers. 

I have but one more item of information, and it is 
somewhat important. It relates to an Englishman who 
has just been writing about you and your country, and 
to a young and rising English publisher. They are 
collaborating on a novel or a romance, which is to deal 
with the adventures of a nineteenth-century gentleman 
in the days of the Roman empire. The writer is Mr. 
Steevens, author of " The Land of the Almighty Dollar "; 
the publisher is Mr. Grant Richards. Mr. Richards's 
name calls to my mind that he will publish next year 
a long novel by " George Egerton," the lady of " Key- 
notes " fame. The novel will deal with the " question " 
which Mine. Sarah Grand has had all to herself. Now 
we may expect " The Second Beth Book."

TWO DIALS. 



One dial, I think of, on a tower's face: 
Surrounded by the ivy's mild caress, 
It seems uplifted from the care and stress 
Of hurried men who fill the market-place; 
Unminding self, or them, it does but trace 
The sky's far message, bring it more or less 
Of comfort to the waiting heart's distress; 
" Thy joys," it says, " and sorrows flit apace." 

Another Dial: it speaks among us here 
With diverse message from life's vibrant Thought 
That moves as if with banners bright unfurled, 
That comes to lonely workers with its cheer 
And song of widening courage fair inwrought, 
And throbs with every heart-beat of the world.

DR. JTJSTIX WINSOR'S LAST BOOK.* 

The eighth and last volume of Dr. Justin 
Winsor's " Narrative and Critical History of 
America " appeared in 1889. That monu- 
mental work finished, the indefatigable scholar 
who had written much of it, as well as planned 
and edited the whole, immediately sought out 
new fields of conquest. In the eight years that 
succeeded, Dr. Winsor contributed to literature 
four independent historical works. " Christo- 
pher Columbus and how he Revived and Im- 
parted the Spirit of Discovery," 674 pages, 
appeared in 1891. Next came " Cartier to 
Frontenac," 379 pages, 1894. The next year 
"The Mississippi Basin" came out, 484 pages. 
And now, at the end of 1897, we have " The 
Westward Movement," 598 pages. These 
works all bear the same well-known marks 
thorough original investigation, strong grasp 
of material especially cartography, and ad- 
mirable synthesis of historical and scientific 
elements. These are all very great merits in 
an historical writer. In his chosen field no one 
denies, but all admit, Dr. Winsor's easy supe- 
riority ; he is a master indeed. But when we 
come to method and style, not so much can be 
said. Dr. Winsor is never weak and is some- 
times picturesque ; but he has no claim to rank, 
to put it mildly, among the masters of historical 
composition. Still, his works are of solid and 
enduring value, and when all the facts attend- 
ing their production are considered, they reveal 
large resources and great productivity of mind. 
The last one is invested with a tender interest, 
coming to us, as it does, just after the author's 
untimely death. It is painful to a student of 
American history to think that this field of study 
will never be enriched by further productions 
from Dr. Winsor's pen. 

We have spoken of the four volumes that 
have appeared since 1889 as independent works. 
In name they are so, but the last three in reality 
constitute a connected series, as is shown by 
their secondary titles, " Geographical Dis- 
covery in the Interior of North America in its 
Historical Relations, 1534-1700 "; "The Strug- 
gle in America between England and France, 
1697-1763 "; The Colonies and the Republic 
West of the Alleghanies, 1760-1798." It is

graphical Illustrations from Contemporary Sources. By Justin 
Winsor. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



plain that these volumes lay in their author's 
mind as a series, even if he never spoke of them 
as such or gave them a collective name. 

In such a case, any possible division of the 
whole subject into separate books or volumes 
must be more or less arbitrary. Still, the 
present work is well marked off by its subject- 
matter from what came both before and after. 
It presents three closely connected groups of 
facts : First, the gathering of forces in the 
region west of the Alleghany Mountains follow- 
ing the French and Indian War that made it 
possible for the United Colonies to contest its 
possession with Great Britain in the War of 
the Revolution ; secondly, the resulting contest, 
which culminated in the Treaty of Paris, 1783, 
determining the first boundaries of the Repub- 
lic ; thirdly, the subsequent struggle whereby 
the Republic shook off the British hold of the 
Northwest and the Spanish hold of the South- 
west, thus for the first time setting free all its 
members. The author of "The Westward 
Movement " thus describes the compass of the 
work: 

" Adding the time which was necessary to carry out 
these treaties [Jay's, 1794, and San Lorenzo, 1795], it is 
now an even hundred years since the title of the United 
States to this vast region lying between the Appala- 
chians, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi was un- 
mistakably confirmed. For more than thirty years after 
the peace of 1763, the colonies and the Republic strug- 
gled to maintain the American spirit on this eastern- 
central area of the continent. Independence achieved, 
for twelve or fifteen years the United States strove to 
round out its territorial promise. The history of this 
Western region during all those years was constantly 
moulded by its geography, and it is the purpose of the 
present volume to show the ever- varying aspects of this 
struggle." 

The story closes (although the book itself lin- 
gers for another page) with the words : 

" So ends the story of the rounding out of the terri- 
torial integrity of the Republic, as Franklin, Adams, 
and Jay had secured it in 1782, against the indirection 
of our enemies, French, Spanish, and British." 

Within these limits lies, no doubt, the ablest 
exposition of the important topics they embrace 
which has ever been given to the public. Dr. 
Winsor is called upon, in dealing with these 
topics, to pass judgment upon some mooted 
points. To two or three of these we shall direct 
attention. 

From the days when the American plenipo- 
tentiaries at Paris were struggling to bring the 
Revolutionary War to a successful diplomatic 
issue, there have been two opposing views of 
the real relation of the French Government 
at that time to our national integrity. As re- 
spects the West, England was naturally dis-

posed to make the smallest concession that 
would meet the case ; while Spain was bound 
that the Republic should be shut up east of the 
Mountains, or, if admitted to the West, should 
be cribbed and confined within narrow limits. 
But what did France want? Dr. Franklin 
held, at the time, that Count de Vergennes, 
who for this purpose was France, was acting 
in good faith toward the United States ; but 
John Jay and John Adams believed that he 
was secretly playing into the hands of Spain. 
These are the Franklin and the Jay-Adams 
views of the situation, which have been pro- 
jected forward to the present time, and neither 
of which gives a sign of coming to an end. 
The question is a subject for a monograph ; we 
have space here to say but little more than that 
it is a fact for scholars to note that Dr. Win- 
sor, as the last sentence quoted above would 
suggest, throws the weight of his authority into 
the Jay- Adams scale. He holds that the pub- 
lications of Circourt, Fitzmaurice, Doniol, and 
Stevens have justified the suspicions of the two 
negotiators rather than the confidence of the 
one. 

" Vergennes' present purpose was patent. He wished 
to weaken the United States, and he desired to have 
England acknowledge that the bounds of Canada ran to 
the Ohio, so that if ever a turn in fortune rendered it 
possible, France could recover by treaty her possessions 
in the St. Lawrence Valley." 

Dr. Winsor might have added, we think, with 
equal truth, that the French Minister also de- 
sired to gratify and to strengthen Spain. For- 
tunately, the difference of opinion among our 
representatives at Paris did not practically 
embarrass the negotiations ; Jay boldly took 
the initiative in disregarding the instructions 
of Congress to consult the Most Christian King 
at every step, Franklin acquiesced, and the pre- 
liminary treaty of peace was concluded, so far 
as the Americans were concerned, upon the 
theory that Vergennes was playing double. 
Dr. Winsor quotes Shelburne to the effect that 
Franklin " wanted to do everything by cunning," 
and then adds : 

" He was never more astute which may be a more 
pleasing word than in now yielding to Adams and 
Jay; and he was never more successfully judicious than 
in disarming the resentment of Vergennes when that 
minister discovered how he had been foiled." 

The arguments that disposed England to 
yield up the West is a subordinate, but still 
an interesting, question. It is common for his- 
torical writers, and especially for historical ora- 
tors, to point to the conquest of George Rogers 
Clark as the decisive fact. No man who under- 



stands Western history will depreciate this bril- 
liant exploit ; still it is by no means certain 
that the conquest was the pivotal point on 
which the surrender turned. Some historical 
scholars certainly will be glad to liear Dr. 
Winsor say : 

" So the Spanish and French Bourbons were thwarted 
in reality by the adhesion of England to her old colonial 
charters, and by her purpose to make them an inheritance 
for her emancipated colonies. The conquest of the 
Northwest by Clark told in the final result rather more 
against the pretensions of Spain than against those of 
England." 

In formulating the American claims to the 
West, the Committee of Congress threw the 
emphasis upon the chartered limits of the old 
colonies ; and yet, as already stated, men have 
not been wanting who denied that the charters 
had any considerable influence upon the issue. 
But whatever the fact may be, it is not a little 
curious that England, our bitter enemy, was 
more willing to give us the West than France, 
our firm ally, and Spain, the ally of France, 
were that we should have it. 

The Ordinance of 1787 presents two moot 
points, one relating to its origin and one to its 
authority. Dr. Winsor utters no uncertain 
sound on either one. Once it was the fashion, 
in accordance with the ancient custom of em- 
phasizing individual lawgivers, to assign the 
principal credit of this famous act of legisla- 
tion to single men, as Thomas Jefferson or 
Nathan Dane. Dr. Winsor, of course, adopts 
the newer and sounder view that several minds 
contributed to it valuable ideas ; but while not 
going so far as the late Dr. W. F. Poole, who 
led the way in this direction,* he sees plain 
evidence of the hand of Dr. Manasseh Cutler, 
one of the directors of the Ohio Company of 
Associates. 

The other question, while less discussed, is 
perhaps even more doubtful. The form of the 
Ordinance is peculiarly impressive. The last 
six articles are called " Articles of Compact 
between the Original States and the people and 
States in the said Territory," and are declared 
to be " forever unalterable," " unless by com- 
mon consent." The long struggle over the 
question of slavery in the Territories gave an 
added emphasis. One of the six articles fixed 
the boundaries of the future States to be formed 
out of the Territory ; and yet not one of these 
States to-day conforms, or practically ever has 
conformed, to these limits ; Congress assumed 
materially to change lines, and sometimes in

and the Ordinance of 1787."

the face of the strongest opposition of the State 
or States affected. Again, another article for- 
ever prohibited slavery within the Territory ; 
and yet there were slaves, and there long con- 
tinued to be slaves, within the limits of every 
one of these States with the possible exception 
of Ohio, while in two if not three of them vig- 
orous efforts were made to give slavery a per- 
manent status. While these facts detract some- 
what from the solemnity of the Ordinance, we 
still think Dr. Winsor dismisses it too lightly 
when he says : 

" So the Ordinance of 1787 introduces us to nothing 
new in human progress. There was doubtless that in it 
which proved a guiding star for future legislation, as in 
the struggle over the slavery question in Illinois ; but it 
may well be questioned if later enactments, without 
such a beacon, and keeping in sight the interests of the 
community as they arose, would not have made of the 
Northwest all that it has become. The provisions of 
this fundamental law were operative just so far as the 
public interests demanded, and no further, and the public 
interests would have had their legitimate triumph 
unaided by it. The Ordinance simply shared this con- 
dition with all laws in communities which are self- 
respecting and free." 

On the other hand, it would not be difficult to 
show, in our opinion, that much of the large 
wedge of territory lying between the Ohio and 
Mississippi rivers, which reaches so far towards 
the Gulf of Mexico, would, to say the least, 
have been completely given over to slavery for 
a considerable term of years, as the territory 
on either side of it was, if it had not been for 
this powerful bulwark of free labor. 

The name " Westward Movement " is sin- 
gularly well chosen for such a work as this. 
Next to the planting of English civilization on 
the Atlantic slope in the first part of the seven- 
teenth century, the planting of American civili- 
zation in the Great West in the second part of 
the eighteenth century is the most impressive 
event in our history. This fact even scholars 
living east of what used to be called " the 
Mountains " are coming to understand. Dr. 
Winsor's valuable work will hasten the com- 
mon appreciation of this great event. 

As we have seen, the work closes with the 
execution of the treaties of 1794 and 1795, 
which set free the Northwestern and South- 
western limbs of the young and growing Re- 
public. This consummation had been devoutly 
wished for, and striven for, by both people and 
government ever since 1783. Once accom- 
plished, it became the point of departure for 
the first enlargement of the national dominion, 
the Louisiana Purchase, and for the ultimate 
bringing down of the national boundaries to 



the Gulf of Mexico and the Rio Grande, and 
their extension to the Pacific shore. It is mat- 
ter for deep regret that Dr. Winsor did not live 
to tell the story of our national expansion. 

We have never understood, and do not now 
understand, why Dr. Winsor, in the prepara- 
tion of his last three works, wholly refrained 
from naming his sources, save as an occasional 
one is mentioned in the text. It is a serious 
defect. The books are all provided with good

GRANT AND :LEE AS NATIONAL HEROES.* 

The issue together of volumes on Grant and 
Lee in such a series as that of the " Heroes of 
the Nations " gives the critic pause. The pub- 
lishers of this now deservedly popular series of 
biographies state in their prospectus that " the 
current of each national life is distinctly indi- 
cated, and its picturesque and noteworthy pe- 
riods and episodes are presented for the reader, 
in their philosophical relation to each other as 
well as to universal history." Here is an explicit 
proposal to unfold not only the facts but also 
the underlying* truths of national life out of 
which those facts flow and by means of which 
they must be estimated. The historian who goes 
beyond the mere narrative to philosophical 
relations has assumed the responsibility, if not 
of a teacher, at least of a prophet, and we have 
a right to look to him for guidance in our effort 
to discriminate the good from the hurtful, the 
permanent from the transient, in national life 
and progress. 

With such a conception of the function of 
the historian of a people's life, we are fain to 
ask the question, What is a national hero? 
This may be said to involve the subordinate 
question, What is a hero ? There is no diffi- 
culty in arriving at a general consensus of 
opinion on this latter point. Men are pretty 
well agreed on the nature of true heroism, and 
cheerfully accord to the doer of a brave or self- 
sacrificing deed or series of deeds their word of 
praise, without reference to any larger environ- 
ment of fact or of idea. Heroes are to be found 
in every band of rebels, and heroism in associa-

tion with every grade of morality or immorality. 
But when one comes to the larger question, 
What is a national hero ? more complex ele- 
ments are to be faced, and a larger view of life is 
to be taken. Here also personal character may 
not enter in to make or to mar our estimate, 
albeit it assuredly may heighten or depress the 
sum total. But will anyone undertake calmly 
to say that any man is or can be a national hero 
the supreme effort and achievement of whose 
career is not efficient toward the life and pro- 
gress of the whole nation ? Far be it from any 
sane critic to say aught in disparagement of the 
nobility of soul and of character of that' magnifi- 
cent soldier and man, Robert E. Lee. Men are 
coming more and more without regard to 
section to know that this was one of the sweet- 
est and serenest lives ever lived in the public 
gaze, and to recognize the transcendent military 
ability which so long held at bay a lengthening 
list of commanders, and yielded at last only 
when resistance was no longer possible. One 
will as readily grant that it was from a mistaken 
sense of duty that he conscientiously gave his 
sword to a cause whose motive principle 
offended his reason and outraged his heart, 
although aware that men of the South as brave 
and as conscientious as he abandoned their 
homes to fight in the ranks marshalled against 
their people, or else remained to face obloquy 
and ostracism. But that man was no secession- 
ist who wrote, as late as January 23, 1861, the 
words : 

" As an American citizen I take great pride in my 
country, her prosperity and her institutions, and would 
defend any State if her rights were invaded. But I 
can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than 
a dissolution of the Union. It would be an accumula- 
tion of all the evils we complain of, and I am willing to 
sacrifice everything but honour for its preservation. I 
hope, therefore, that all constitutional means will be ex- 
hausted before there is a resort to force. Secession is 
nothing but revolution. The framers of our Constitu- 
tion never exhausted so much labour, wisdom, and for- 
bearance in its formation, and surrounded it with so 
many guards and securities, if it was intended to be 
broken by every member of the Confederacy at will. It 
is intended for ' perpetual Union,' so expressed in the 
preamble, and for the establishment of a government, 
not a compact, which can only be dissolved by revolu- 
tion, or the consent of all the people in convention as- 
sembled. It is idle to talk of secession: anarchy would 
have been established, and not a government, by Wash- 
ington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, and all the other 
patriots of the Revolution. . . . Still, a Union that can 
only be maintained by swords and bayonets, and in which 
strife and civil war are to take the place of brotherly 
love and kindness, has no charm for me. I shall mourn 
for my country and for the welfare and progress of 
mankind. If the Union is dissolved and the Govern- 
ment disrupted, I shall return to my native State and 



share the miseries of my people, and, save in defense, 
will draw my sword on none." 

It affects this not at all that the Preamble 
says nothing about " perpetual union," as Lee 
supposed. With the sound of his patriotic 
words in our ears, one turns page after page of 
his latest biography with profound melancholy. 
One looks in vain in these four hundred and 
fifty pages for a calm and adequate estimate 
of one who was probably the greatest master of 
military strategy this country has produced, of 
one who was as pure and unselfish in all his 
personal life as he was sadly mistaken in his 
public career. The author is too busy in posing 
as the champion of a lost cause, which time and 
public opinion have decided not to be a national 
one or a good one, and which we leave to 
the condemnation spoken by the words above 
quoted, ever to take time to do full justice 
to his hero. It is pitiful, in these closing 
years of the century, to read that " in the 
planter's home the African learned to set a 
higher value upon the domestic virtues which 
he saw illustrated in the lives of Christian men 
and women "; to see all the social features of 
" the peculiar institution " set down in the 
credit column, and only the economic results 
debited to the powers of evil. Let Lee's own 
words "I think it is a greater evil to the 
white race than to the black race " be a 
sufficient answer, though it but half lift the 
veil from the festering plague-spot of slavery. 
One learns in this book despite Lee's opinion 
to the contrary that the idea of the fathers, 
one and all, did not go further than a temporary 
and "trial" union; that " slowly upward toward 
a fitness for citizenship this mild servitude was 
lifting the negro." The Dred Scott decision is 
handled as reverently as the ark of the covenant ; 
one would never gather here that it marked the 
lowest humiliation of our great court, or that it 
was obiter dicta. One reads regarding Lincoln 
that " want of accurate knowledge concerning 
the origin of the Federal Union inspired the 
historical errors of the Inaugural Address of 
March 4, 1861, which was merely the untenable 
theory of original consolidation," and that 
" President Lincoln ventured to designate a 
committee's recommendation in 1774 as a legal 
instrument establishing a government ! " Of 
his Gettysburg speech we learn that it was " a 
masterpiece of rhetorical beauty, and also of 
the art of shifting great issues." Of McClellan, 
in the summer of 1862, it is said that " while 
he was glorying in the title accorded him of 
* the Young Napoleon,' Lee, on the other hand,

was bending every energy to collect the scat- 
tered Confederates." But one's melancholy is 
quickened into something like indignation, 
when, turning to the title-page, he reads that 
this belated exploiter of dead institutions and 
dead theories of government, who writes the 
symbols of a double doctorate after his name, 
is a professor of history in an American Col- 
lege, and that one which bears the name of 
Washington. It is a misfortune for the grand 
" Old Dominion " that its sons are still being 
taught such strange things in the name of 
truth, and that the true music of such a har- 
monious life, personally, as that of Lee should 
be marred by such an accompaniment. One 
note sounds true in the book. It is the presen- 
tation of the folly of reconstruction methods, 
which the lamented death of Lincoln made pos- 
sible. Forcible in their antitheses are the fol- 
lowing sentences : 

" The war of aggression against the Southern States 
had been prosecuted upon Lincoln's theory that these 
states were still in the Union, and could not possibly get 
out. Congress dealt with them upon the theory that 
the war had left them out of the Union, and they could 
not enter within except through the mercy of the con- 
querors, who held them as subjugated provinces ! " 

The narrative, in this book, of Lee's cam- 
paigns is spirited and well done, and if this had 
been the main theme small room for criticism 
could be found. The same commendation 
may be given to Colonel Church's volume on 
Grant. This writer has handled the military 
life of his hero with great discernment, and has 
made a fine summary. Here again, however, 
although the many personal touches espe- 
cially from the earlier life of Grant are 
pleasing, there is no attempt at an estimate of 
the military man, although the constant pres- 
ence in these pages of three out of four of the 
greatest soldiers of our age Grant, Lee, Sher- 
man, Johnston continually suggests one. The 
very different character of the task given each 
one of these men, involving not only military 
accomplishment, but also resources of men, 
equipment, and transport, makes a comparison 
as impossible as it is undesirable. It is not 
necessary to disparage either Lee or Grant for 
the purpose of estimating the other. Each 
made mistakes, especially in his earlier cam- 
paigning in Virginia. Each had abilities 
which the other lacked. Professor White 
makes the most of such criticism on Grant as 
is found in Walker's " History of the Second 
Army Corps," with reference to Cold Harbor ; 
and Colonel Church's sketch does not meet 
fully such attack. But General Grant was 



frank to criticize his own mistakes in his " Per- 
sonal Memoirs." There is, however, a steadily 
growing conviction that the highest mark of 
his genius is found in his "having his own 
way " in the face of the political mismanagers 
at Washington, and even of public opinion 
a thing that all his military predecessors had 
not been able to dare to do. This large cour- 
age to go ahead and hew out his own road in 
spite of all adverse criticism was the one thing 
the nation needed to constrain the genius of 
Lee, and it could afford even the costly experi- 
ments of the campaigns from the Rapidan to 
the James in 1884 to give such a rider a firm 
and commanding seat. 

The simplicity of Grant's nature is well set 
forth, even in the mistakes which it made pos- 
sible ; and he comes forth with credit even from 
the disastrous personal experiences which cast a 
gloom over his last days. The great, simple- 
hearted, silent warrior, who fought that the 
land might have peace, and whose grandest 
voucher as a great commander is found in the 
undying loyalty of his peer Sherman stands 
unadorned in these pages. Many who cannot 
share the satisfaction of Colonel Church in his 
contemplation of the presidential career, and 
who, regretting that the drnm-and-fife theory 
of government forced the great captain into a 
political career for which his simple-minded 
honesty unfitted him, would gladly have seen 
him pass from his battle record to the rewards 
of private life, will be content to leave him to 
his military fame. And to that other, while not 
a hero of the Nation, they will ever give the 
homage of respect and admiration due to a great 
soul which, sorely tried, went on its chosen way 
with an humble and reverent spirit to the end.

the United States, may be regarded as attempts 
of this sort, and as representing what is likely 
to be one of the chief phases of the work of 
geologists in the future, namely, the construc- 
tive or synthetic phase. While the analysis 
which must precede this sort of work may not 
yet be complete in any field, it has gone so far 
in many that synthesis is profitable, even if not 
final. That it is not final, none know better 
than those who attempt it. In the preface to 
his work on "Ancient Volcanoes of Great 
Britain," Sir Archibald Geikie says that a 
book which is abreast of our knowledge to-day 
begins to be left behind to-morrow. While 
this is probably measurably true, the volumes 
before us are at least up to date now, and are 
not likely to become antiquated for a long time 
to come. 

Sir Archibald Geikie has become well known 
as one of the few geologists able to present a 
technical subject in a semi-popular way without 
sacrificing the accuracy of the subject-matter 
involved ; and his present work will in no way 
detract from his reputation in this line. While, 
as the title indicates, the object is to give an 
account of the ancient volcanoes of Great Brit- 
ain, this account is prefaced by a series of 
chapters that prepare the reader not already 
thoroughly familiar with this phase of geology 
for an appreciation of that which follows. The 
introductory chapters give a brief but adequate 
glance at the views which have prevailed at 
various times concerning the nature of volca- 
noes, a brief statement concerning the causes 
of volcanic activity, a discussion of volcanic 
products, and a general account of existing 
volcanoes, from the study of which geologists 
have learned how to study and interpret the 
volcanoes of the past. But this introductory 
study of existing volcanoes is in itself most in- 
structive, far in advance of most text-books. 
The special merit, or at any rate one of the 
special merits, of this part of the work lies in 
the fact that volcanoes are looked at from the 
historic (in a geological sense) point of view. 
Existing volcanoes are described as the descend- 
ants of a long line of ancestors, and their full 
significance is seen only when studied in the 
light of this ancestry. Only when so studied 
do they throw their true light on the problems 
of the physical evolution of the globe. The in- 
troduction of this historical idea into the study 
of existing volcanoes is an admirable prepara- 
tion for the more detailed portion of the work, 
in which the author's aim, stated in his own 
language, is as follows : 



" I shall try to show the nature and relative import- 
ance of the records of ancient volcanoes; how these 
records, generally so fragmentary, may be pieced to- 
gether so as to be made to furnish the history which 
they contain; how their relative chronology maybe es- 
tablished ; how their testimony may be supplemented in 
such wise that the position of long vanished seas, lands, 
rivers, and lakes may be ascertained; and how, after 
ages of geological revolution, volcanic rocks that have 
lain long buried under the surface now influence the 
scenery of the regions where they have once more been 
exposed to view." 

In carrying out this plan, the author has taken 
pains to make sharp distinctions between facts 
and theories, and between theories that are well 
founded and those that are merely speculative. 
The study of the ancient volcanoes is taken up 
historically. There is an account of the vol- 
canoes and volcanic rocks of each of the several 
great divisions of geological time, beginning 
with the pre-Cambrian. Those of Cambrian, 
Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Ter- 
tiary ages are dealt with successively. In the 
case of each period, the study of volcanoes is 
taken up much as it might be in the case of ex- 
isting or recent volcanoes ; that is, the ancient 
volcanoes are studied with reference to their 
types of eruption, the conditions under which 
the eruptions took place, the character of the 
products discharged, the variations in these 
products during a period of activity, etc. 

In discussing the volcanic action of the vari- 
ous periods, the author has frequently taken 
pains to bring out at the same time the salient 
points in the physical geography of Great Brit- 
ain ; thus, we find sections with such headings 
as " The Physical Geography of the Cambrian 
Period," and "Land and Sea of Silurian 
Times." These topics, which at first thought 
might appear to be outside the scope of the 
volume, really have a bearing upon the main 
theme under consideration. This ability to 
comprehend and portray the broad relations of 
things constitutes one of the charms of Sir 
Archibald's writings. 

The study of the ancient volcanoes of Great 
Britain has led to many general conclusions 
which are of interest. The ancient volcanoes are 
found to be distributed in a belt running length- 
wise of the island and along its west side. They 
have been so widely distributed in time that the 
persistence of volcanic activity is to be regarded 
as one of the great facts of geological history. 
Furthermore, the volcanic activity has been 
intermittent. Nearly every great division of 
Paleozoic time namely, Cambrian, Silurian 
(Lower), Devonian, and Carboniferous has 
had its great series of eruptions ; but there was 



1898.]

general quiet, so far as this phase of activity was 
concerned, in the Upper Silurian. The Meso- 
zoic periods seem not to have been marked by 
volcanic activity within the area considered, but 
such activity was renewed in the early Tertiary. 
While extending through this great range of 
time, the periods of activity have been separated 
by long intervals of quiescence. The same 
localities have served repeatedly for the dis- 
charge of lava and other igneous products. 
Thus, in southwestern England there were great 
eruptions in the Devonian, the Subcarbonifer- 
ous, and the Permian. In southern Scotland, 
within a very restricted area, there were Silu- 
rian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian 
eruptions. Another important conclusion is 
that the sites of volcanoes, throughout the his- 
tory of Great Britain, were not determined by 
any obvious structure in the rocks now visible. 
They were not usually connected with faults, 
even when faults existed near the volcanic 
region. Again, it seems to be clearly indicated 
that the volcanic vents were, as a rule, on low 
land rather than on high, throughout the course 
of the physical history of Great Britain. The 
great series of volcanic rocks occuring in the 
central hollow of the Scottish midlands found 
their way to the surface in a region which was 
a great depression at the time they were ex- 
truded. The great Tertiary eruptions took 
place in the depression between the outer ridge 
of the Hebrides and the mainland of Scotland ; 
while the Permian volcanoes were all in valleys, 
the adjacent highlands being free from them. 
It is suggested that " a difference of a few hun- 
dreds or thousands of feet in the depth of over- 
lying rock, such as the difference of height 
between the bottom of a valley and the tops of 
the adjacent hills, may determine the path of 
escape for the magna through the least thick- 
ness of overarching roof." 

The conclusion is reached that periods of 
general crustal disturbance were in a general 
way periods when volcanic activity was great, 
and that periods of crustal quiescence were 
periods during which volcanic action was least. 
The Lower Silurian period was a period of 
general crustal disturbance in Great Britain, 
and these disturbances were accompanied by 
great volcanic activity. The Upper Silurian 
was a period of general quiet, and there was 
little volcanic activity. The great disturbances 
of the Old Red Sandstone period were acom- 
panied or followed by great outpourings of lava ; 
while the Tertiary volcanic activity, perhaps the 
greatest in the history of the island, was con- 



nected in time with the latest great orographic 
movements of Western Europe. 

Another conclusion of moment is that there 
has been essential uniformity of volcanism since 
the known beginnings of geological history. 
While volcanic activity has been widely distri- 
buted throughout geological time, the periods 
of eruption during the Paleozoic seem to con- 
stitute a diminishing series from Lower Silu- 
rian to Permian, the periods of activity being 
separated by intervals of quiescence. After 
the Permian there was a long period of qui- 
escence, following which volcanic activity was 
renewed on a scale greater than at any previous 
time : so that it cannot be concluded that vol- 
canic activity is declining. The study of the 
igneous rocks of all ages leads to the conclusion 
that there is no less and no greater variety of 
igneous matter in recent than in earlier times, 
showing that there has been an essential uni- 
formity of products as well as of activities. 

The study of the ancient volcanoes also shows 
that there is a recognizable sequence in the 
nature of the materials erupted during a single 
volcanic period, from the earliest to the latest 
times, and that, in spite of occasional departures, 
the normal order remains broadly uniform. In 
general, the earlier eruptions of each period 
were most basic and the later most acid, indi- 
cating that there was in the course of a single 
period of igneous activity a progressive dimi- 
nution in the quantity of bases and a corre- 
sponding increase in the proportion of acids in 
the lavas discharged. The fact that the igneous 
rocks of various periods are essentially the same, 
even in the same locality, shows that the magma 
from which the discharges proceeded must have 
been renewed from time to time during the 
period of quiescence, so that the nature and 
succession of lavas brought out at one period 
are much the same as those of another. 

The volumes are illustrated by nearly 400 
figures, and by seven maps which show the dis- 
tribution of the volcanoes and igneous rocks of 
the several periods. 

Professor Russell's work on the volcanoes of 
North America covers a much wider area than 
the work just considered, but a correspond- 
ingly more restricted period of time. Its object 
is "to make clear the principal features of vol- 
canoes in general, and to place in the hands of 
students a concise account of the leading facts 
thus far discovered concerning the physical 
features of North America which can be traced 
directly to the influence of volcanic action."

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



The scope of this volume is therefore much more 
limited than that of the preceding work. The 
time is not yet ripe for a treatise on the ancient 
volcanoes of North America corresponding in 
detail to that on the volcanoes of Great Britain. 
Before this shall be possible, years of careful 
work must be done. Nevertheless, Professor 
Russell's volume, which does not attempt more 
than is now possible, is a welcome summary of 
our present knowledge concerning existing and 
recent volcanoes from the point of view an- 
nounced by the author. 

Like the author of the preceding volumes, 
Professor Russell has devoted an introductory 
chapter to the discussion of volcanic phenomena 
in general. Following this are chapters devoted 
to such topics as "Types of Volcanoes," "Stages 
in the Lives of Volcanoes," " Characteristics of 
the Products of Volcanoes," " Profiles of Vol- 
canic Mountains," " Structure of Volcanic 
Mountains," "Erosion of Volcanic Mountains," 
" Subterranean Intrusions," and " Character- 
istics of Igneous Rocks." Subsequent chap- 
ters deal with the general question of the dis- 
tribution of volcanoes in North America, and 
give longer or shorter descriptions of the vol- 
canoes of the different portions of the continent. 
Following the chapters which describe the active 
and extinct volcanoes of Central America, 
Mexico, and the United States, an account is 
given of our present knowledge concerning the 
deposits of volcanic dust. A general discussion 
of the causes of volcanic activity follows the 
descriptive portion of the volume. These state- 
ments concerning the contents of the volume 
may suffice to indicate the ground which it 
covers ; and if it be added that these various 
topics are treated in such a way as to justify the 
explanatory title, " A reading lesson for stu- 
dents of geology and geography," the character 
of the work will be made clear. 

One of the important and attractive features 
of the book is its treatment of many of the 
curious and striking geographic features of the 
Far West, a region which is as yet too little 
known even to those who are charged with the 
direction of geographic study. Throughout 
the work, too, Professor Russell has introduced 
the historical idea into his descriptions of the 
subject-matter in hand, as the topics " Stages 
in the Lives of Volcanoes " and " The Life- 
history of a Volcano " sufficiently show. This 
gives the volume an additional value to teachers, 
as this is an element which has generally re- 
ceived far too little consideration. 

The chapter on the deposits of volcano dust 



deals with a phase of volcanic products which 
is less familiar than most others. The great 
abundance of such dust, and its wide distribu- 
tion, give rise to a conception of volcanic activ- 
ity in North America within recent times which 
is not commonly held. In view of the object 
of the volume, Professor Russell is perhaps 
justified in giving some rein to the imagination 
in connection with this subject. He says : 

" The great abundance of volcanic dust in the Cor- 
dilleran region, its wide distribution, and its occurrence 
in numerous instances at many horizons in the same ver- 
tical section, is evidence that vast areas in Western North 
America have been shrouded in darkness at many sepa- 
rate periods, and have time and again witnessed horrors 
like those which overwhelmed Pompeii and Hercula- 
neum. Disasters similar to those accompanying the 
eruptions of Conseguina and Krakatoa occurred at in- 
tervals throughout the Tertiary and Recent history of 
fully one-half of North America." 

The effects of these discharges of volcanic dust, 
as conceived by Professor Russell, are thus ex- 
pressed : 

" The volcanic dust of the Pacific states sometimes 
contains the bones of mammals and is frequently charged 
with quantities of leaves, showing that some of the tem- 
pests generated by volcanic agencies were disastrous to 
animal and plant life. These and related disturbances 
in environment probably had much to do with the modi- 
fication and extinction especially of the higher mam- 
malian species." 

The chapter devoted to a consideration of 
the causes of volcanic action includes an ele- 
mentary statement of the principles believed to 
be concerned, and of the various theories that 
have been advocated as to the methods according 
to which these principles work. The discussion 
touches the vital points in the explanation of 
volcanoes, and in such a way as to be readily 
understood by readers of maturity, even though 
their knowledge of geology and allied sciences 
be meagre. While this discussion does not 
contain much that purports to be especially 
new, the presentation of the subject is much 
better than that which appears in most text- 
books. Incidentally, some original suggestions 
are introduced which are well worthy of con- 
sideration. 

Professor Russell's book will be a valuable 
work of reference for students of geology in 
the last years of high school, and for maturer 
students who are interested in geology and 
geography, even though their preparatory stud- 
ies in these subjects have been neglected. The 
volume is illustrated by sixteen plates, some of 
which are maps, and some of which are half- 
tone reproductions of notable volcanic peaks.

THE FEMININE INTERPRETATION 
OF JESUS.* 

It sometimes appears as if the more learned 
a life of Jesus is made the less it reveals the 
personality it seeks to portray. Such learned 
treatises are very numerous and very useful ; 
but the number is small of biographies of Jesus 
which make his career much more than a string 
upon which to hang archaeological disquisitions 
and pious reflections. Indeed, it is as rare to 
find a life of Jesus in English that is a true 
narrative as it is to find one that is scientific in 
its method. It is therefore with interest that 
one turns to a biography of Jesus produced by 
a skilled story-teller who has at the same time 
deep sympathies with things that make for 
beauty and righteousness. 

Mrs. Ward characterizes her " Story " as a 
narrative that, and nothing more. Yet the 
title itself shows that such a narrative is 
intended to set forth some conception of who 
and what Jesus was. Such a method is legiti- 
mate, though unusual in this class of literature. 
It is simply doing for the Gospel what the 
writer of an historical novel does for his sources. 
Granting that the writer's imagination is kept 
within the bounds of what his sources make 
probable, and that facts are not distorted in the 
interest of some theory, there is no reason why 
a character should not be set forth in action as 
well as by description. But these two conditions 
are absolute. 

As regards the present volume, it can be said 
that from the point of view of sober historical 
investigation there is nothing in it worthy of 
the attention of scholars. The general chro- 
nological scheme of the life of Jesus is that of 
the conventional harmony of the most conserva- 
tive sort. It is true that some of the difficulties 
that beset an uncritical handling of the text 
are obviated by judicious omissions and the 
proper placing of emphasis in treatment ; but 
that an interpretative narrative really should 
aid one in solving such problems of harmoniza- 
tion as the two cleansings of the Temple is not 
to be expected. Such few archaeological ele- 
ments as are introduced are treated with the 
experienced touch of a maker of novels ; but 
they are those to be found in almost any life of 
Christ, and are simply details necessary for 
literary treatment. The same is true of geo- 
graphical references, although here accuracy is 
less pronounced and one becomes at times some-

what confused in following the footsteps or the 
vision of Jesus. Altogether, in all matters in 
which scholarship is indispensable and of pri- 
mary importance the volume is justly regarded 
by its author as outside of criticism. 

In the region, however, in which the book 
does profess to be of help, much more can be 
said in its behalf. As one possibly might ex- 
pect, the narrative at times is somewhat over- 
told, the dramatic incidents are sometimes over- 
worked, the completeness of the biography at 
times is sacrificed to the necessities of dramatic 
interest. But none the less, it is graphic, 
earnest, and successful in presenting the inter- 
pretation intended. If one is tempted to say 
that Mrs. Ward has preferred to describe mira- 
cles rather than teaching, to strain out the less 
difficult elements of the Gospel narrative while 
accepting those about which the critic feels the 
least confidence, to follow Renan though at 
a great distance into the uncertain ways of a 
romance, the reply is ready that such must of 
necessity be the method of a narrative, and that 
such elements also may very well be elements 
in the interpretation. 

And what is the interpretation ? The Jesus 
who looks out from these pages is not a strong, 
resistless Messiah. Despite his ability to raise 
the dead, and walk on the waves, and feed 
thousands with a few loaves, he is continually 
questioning himself as to himself and his mis- 
sion ; he is repeatedly brought to the verge of 
despair by the uncertainties that overhang his 
mission ; he grows weak with alternating periods 
of exaltation and depression ; he looks much 
with deep eyes at other souls in silence ; he 
barely escapes hysteria under severest strain ; 
he hears about him hosts of unseen spirits. 
Withal, he is passionately religious, but trust- 
ing ever to his intuition rather than to his 
reason. And thus, altogether, he is a woman 
and not a man. Strong and spiritual, he is not 
strong and spiritual after a man's fashion. The 
interpretation is unexpected, is doubtless un- 
conscious, but as one re-reads the volume it is 
indubitable. 

And thus we have a new contribution to the 
ceaseless effort to interpret the personality of 
Jesus. For that this work really adds to our 
knowledge of him, one cannot for a moment 
doubt. All that subtle, emotional life which 
the mere scholar especially if he be a man 
so soon outgrows is discerned by the one who 
comes like Mary to sit in sympathy rather than 
in analysis and philosophy. In the hands of 
Mrs. Ward some things that have escaped the

scholar are thus made to appear, and despite 
the limitations of her interpretation it is sure 
to be helpful because it has made Jesus real 
has given to him, one may say, the objective 
reality of a hero of a story. 

SHAILER MATHEWS. 



PROBLEMS or SELF AND OF SOCIETY.* 

Professor Baldwin follows up his work on " Men- 
tal Development in the Child and in the Race " with 
a very important and interesting contribution to 
social psychology. The point to be investigated is 
the relation of individual to social development, and 
the extent to which one throws light on the other. 
The author describes three methods of dealing with 
this problem the historic, the sociological, and the 
genetic ; and he proposes to use the last, without 
excluding the others. This method " inquires into 
the psychological development of the human indi- 
vidual in the earlier stages of his growth, for light 
upon his social nature, and also upon the social 
organization in which he bears a part." The men- 
tal development of infancy has been the author's 
favorite field of study, and his illustrations have the 
freshness of direct personal observation. 

The volume is divided into two books one on 
the Person (446 pages), and the other on Society 
(198 pages). The discussion of the " imitative 
person " shows the process by which new elements 
find their way into the life of the soul. Social 
heredity is carefully distinguished from physical 
heredity. The person is built up by assimilating 
the life of society. He becomes himself by becoming 
a social creature. There is no such contradiction 
between self interest and social interest as Mr. Ben- 
jamin Kidd assumes. It is rational for a man to 
further the common good because his reason itself 
would not exist save through the creative forces in- 
herent in society. 

The social person is always an inventor, making 
discoveries for himself if not for the world. Im- 
portant aids to the inventive process are language, 
play, and art. Play, for example, is not merely 
the outburst of superabundant vitality running to 
waste, and it is more than mere imitation of the 
serious labors of adults ; it is actual training for the 
motions, gestures, labors, and arts of the community.

W. D. P. Bliss. New York : Funk A Wagnalls Co. 



The true genius is an inventor in a larger sense 
than is the average man, but he is not isolated from 
his kind. If he has ability of the highest order, 
and is thoroughly sane, he will see what is practi- 
cable and useful. There is risk of society thinking 
him a visionary or a rebel ; but there is also a possi- 
bility of the insane man imagining himself a genius. 

Under the caption " The Person's Equipment " 
we have an analysis of instincts, emotions, intelli- 
gence, and sentiments, and an account of the man- 
ner in which they are formed by social factors, and 
yet tend to rise above the level of the actual at new 
points. The person is held to his task by certain 
" sanctions," and these are not merely outward con- 
straints, but impulses, desires, ethical and religious 
sentiments, which are social products. 

Coming to the brief concluding chapters on So- 
ciety, we find the person set in the only environ- 
ment which is natural to him. The person is the 
" particularizing " force, and society generalizes 
elements of progress introduced by individuals. It 
is by this reciprocity between habitual conduct and 
custom on the one hand, and finer or wider accom- 
modations on the other hand, that society moves 
onward. Strong emphasis is laid upon the distinc- 
tion between the matter of social organization and 
the functional method. The matter of social or- 
ganization " consists of thoughts : by which is meant 
all sorts of intellectual states, such as imaginations, 
knowledges, and informations." The process of 
social organization turns on the imitative function. 
The person " reaches his subjective understanding 
of the social copy by imitation, and then he con- 
firms his interpretations by another imitative act 
by which he ejectively reads his self-thought into 
the persons of others. Each of these stages is essen- 
tial to his growth as a person, and so also is it 
essential to the growth of society. For society 
grows by imitative generalization of the thoughts of 
individuals. 

No brief summary can do justice to the wealth 
of suggestions of this vigorous treatise. But a few 
words of interrogation may put readers on their 
guard, and set them upon a search for omitted fac- 
tors in social organization ; and the caution is sug- 
gested by the author himself in several places. We 
are distinctly told that the historical and sociologi- 
cal methods, with the data of anthropology and 
analysis of institutions, are used only in a subordi- 
nate way. The phenomena held in the foreground 
are those of infant life. One may accept as probable 
the hypothesis that the child recapitulates the pre- 
vious social history of mankind, and reproduces in 
his attainment of selfhood the " dialectic " by which 
society advances from mob impulses to ethical con- 
trol. But if the best method of learning the process 
of child development is to watch and interpret their 
physical manifestations of psychical life, then the 
most fruitful and reliable method of studying social 
psychology must be directly to observe and interpret 
the embodiments and relations of society in its in- 
stitutions. Since the infant is a product of social

history and a prophecy of the social future, we should 
carefully study him ; but human society never was 
composed entirely of infants. 

We fully agree with the author's rejection of the 
reduction of sociology to a sort of biology, and of 
the whole process of reasoning from biological 
analogies. An adequate study of the individual 
mind must, however, consider the relation of mind 
to body ; and so an adequate study of society must 
have regard to the material forms which are the 
revelation of social life and the means of its progress. 
Therefore we may hesitate to accept as final and 
complete this summary (p. 522) : " The organiza- 
tion which is effected in social life is, in all its forms, 
a psychological organization. Its materials are 
psychological materials : thoughts, with all their 
issue in desires, impulses, sanctions, consciences, 
sentiments." In New England graveyards one sees 
carved on the ancient tombstones images of saints 
or angels, bodiless figures with only faces and wings. 
The effect on the modern mind is grotesque. Society 
as we know it in this world exists on the land and 
sea, draws its physical energies from soil and air, 
and every one of its members is a composite being 
with all the parts and organs of an animal. Ade- 
quate synthesis of social studies compels a full rec- 
ognition of what Schaffle calls "the Social Body." 
Yet if we had to choose between the crude material- 
istic and biological sociology, which has about run 
its course, and this ultra-spiritual view, we should 
choose the latter, and agree with the closing word 
of the eminent psychologist : " The true analogy is 
not that which likens society to a physiological organ- 
ism, but rather that which likens it to a psychological 
organization. And the sort of psychological organi- 
zation to which it is analogous is that which is found 
in the individual in ideal thinking." 

The Elementary treatise on City Government, by 
Mr. Delos F. Wilcox, not only makes good use of 
excellent authorities, but it also goes to sources and 
draws from them fresh materials. The author con- 
siders three principal topics : the functions of city 
government, the problems of control, and the prob- 
lems of organization. The style is clear ; the analyses 
of subjects is suggestive ; and the literary form 
adapts the book for use as text-book or as a reading- 
book. It is encouraging to find at least a suggestion 
that a city is not primarily nor principally a political 
organization. It is to be hoped we may some day 
have a work on cities which gives more attention to 
the social tendencies, wants, organizations, interests, 
which constitute their real life. This is hinted on 
page 15 : " The practical task of political economy 
and sociology is the assignment of functions to the 
state and its agents on the one hand, and to indi- 
viduals and voluntary organizations on the other. 
Politics or political science treats of the methods of 
fulfilling the functions assigned to the state and its 
agents." And also on page 237 : " Back of the 
merely political problems of the city lie the great 
problems of social development." 



" The Coming People " discussed by Mr. Charles 
F. Dole are the products of natural selection in a 
rational and ethical universe. The old moral virtues 
of honesty, veracity, kindness, justice, are not feeble 
ideals of optimistic dreams, but their sanctions are 
in the actual world. The might of the cosmos is in 
them. The modern world is producing a higher 
type. For the care of long-horned cattle, wild and 
fierce, we need rude cow-boys, with revolvers and 
long whips ; but for sleek short-horns and well-bred 
Jerseys, another and finer type of man must be 
chosen as keepers. This is the theme of Mr. Dole's 
attractive and inspiring book. It is a series of ser- 
mons, optimistic, bearing with stress upon the 
moral sense, not specially instructive for the student 
of special social sciences and problems, and giving 
bare outlines of the ethical ideals of social coopera- 
tion. The severe cost and pains by which progress 
must be paid for are not overlooked. The writer 
is sane, well-informed, awake to the infamies which 
blot our civilization, and without any panacea for 
human ills ; but he is always clear as to the power 
which makes for righteousness, always sure that 
iniquity is feeble and truth alone is strong. It is a 
noble and healthy book, by one who has long taught 
men to regard the duties of society as sacred, and 
now shows that these duties are based on a rational, 
practical, and religious view of life. 

The author of " Moral Evolution " excites expec- 
tations of good writing and intelligent interpreta- 
tions. His little treatise on " Inequality and Pro- 
gress" is suggestive and sane. Democracy and 
Christianity both declare for the right of utmost 
self-development for every human being. Before 
the law, every individual must have a fair hearing. 
In religious belief, all are children of a common 
Father. But equality does not exist as a matter of 
fact in this world where the Divine will gives law, 
and where democracy is advancing to supremacy. 
Physically and intellectually, human beings are un- 
like, and must treat each other according to their 
natures and capacities. Education that treats all 
pupils alike is a humiliating failure. Progressive 
methods tend to give scope to individuality and 
variety of talents. Progress secures variety and is 
dependent upon it There must be leaders, if so- 
ciety is to move onward. Monotony is stagnation. 
We live by the awakening and satisfaction of new 
wants. We rise to better ethical and spiritual levels 
by admiration of superiors. Envy is a mean and 
degrading vice. Social unity is not the effect of 
sameness, but of uniqueness of individuals. 

The noble monument of the late Dr. W. H. Ryder 
of Chicago, the lecture endowment " in aid of the 
moral and social welfare of the citizens of Chicago," 
has been the occasion of bringing to the public one 
of Dr. Washington Gladden's most powerful and 
wholesome discussions. The aims and limitations 
of the book, " Social Facts and Forces," are frankly 
stated by the author : " No one will expect to find 
within a space so limited an adequate investigation 
of subjects so large. I have tried to seize upon

some of the salient points, and especially to empha- 
size the tendencies which affect conduct and shape 
character." The subjects discussed are the factory, 
the labor union, the corporation, the railway, the 
city, the church. Technical adaptation of means 
to ends he usually leaves to experts within each or- 
ganization ; Dr. Gladden's purpose is to criticize the 
ethical value of the ends of action, the results in 
character. The reader is compelled at every step 
to inquire what will be the social consequences of a 
particular method of producing wealth and accu- 
mulating fortunes. 

In one large volume one may now find, for the 
first time, a brief and clear statement of nearly 
every important reform movement of our age. " The 
Encyclopedia of Social Reform" includes, as we 
learn from the sub-title, "political economy, polit- 
ical science, sociology, statistics, anarchism, chari- 
ties, civil service, currency, land and legislation, 
penology, socialism, social purity, trades unions, 
woman suffrage," etc. Some of the articles are 
signed by leaders of the various movements repre- 
sented. Advocates of the reforms have been chosen 
to state the case, but the divergent views are also 
given a hearing. There may be some advantage 
given to editorial positions, but there is a manifest 
purpose to give the strongest positions of opposing 
parties. The dictionary form of the work makes it 
very convenient for reference, but breaks up the 
systematic and organic discussion of particular sub- 
jects. The references are fairly complete for pop- 
ular uses. No profession of service to scholars is 
made, as specialists do not depend on cyclopaedias. 
For persons remote from libraries, who wish to have 
a brief statement of the socializing movements of 
our time, this volume is the best available, and it is 
unique in its field. c> R< HENDERSON. 



SOME RECENT STUDIES IN PHIL.OSOPHT.* 

Perhaps the most notable recent contribution to 
philosophy in America is Professor G. T. Ladd's 
large volume entitled " The Philosophy of Knowl- 
edge." This work discusses with great fulness, and 
in the main in an admirable temper, the most gen- 
eral questions concerning human knowledge, such as 
"Thinking and Knowing," "Knowledge of Things

and of Self," " Implicates of Knowledge," " Truth 
and Error," " Knowledge and Reality," " Knowl- 
edge and the Absolute." These subjects, whose 
treatment is embraced under the technical name of 
Epistemology, are the ones upon which modern 
philosophy more and more concentrates, and are 
here treated comprehensively and fairly, and so 
clearly and untechnically that most educated persons 
will have no difficulty in following the writer. Pro- 
fessor Ladd starts from the common consciousness, 
and, indeed, in a measure vindicates it throughout ; 
and his constant assumption is the " I know " of 
common consciousness. The fundamental assump- 
tions of the ordinary unreflecting man are shown to 
have in them a real basis of philosophic truth, and 
hence the philosopher cannot look down in scorn 
upon the plain man of every-day life. But the 
author proceeds far beyond common-sense realism, 
and formulates a critical idealistic realism. The 
Self is the key throughout. Self-knowledge, the 
" I know," appears to Professor Ladd as the clear- 
est and most certain knowledge, and altogether un- 
assailable, and so the basis of all knowledge. The 
mind is capable of knowing a world of things or 
objects only as they are in some sense other-selves, 
and these as the expression of the Absolute Self. 
Another prominent point in the author's method is 
the making of knowledge an expression of the whole 
man, and not an isolated faculty. Feeling and will 
are closely connected with knowledge, and he even 
goes so far (page 187) as to make feeling the essence 
of cognition, or again (page 502) he makes cogni- 
tion " a species of conduct." From this unitary point 
of view, he sharply criticises Kant. There is also 
much criticism of scepticism and agnosticism in 
general. While Professor Ladd has learned much 
from Lotze, Wundt, Paulsen, and other German 
philosophers, he has re-thought the whole into an 
original exposition and criticism. Although we miss 
in this work that high degree of demonstration, 
that definiteness and closeness of thought, and that 
thorough originality of treatment, which character- 
ize a great philosophical treatise, yet by its suggest- 
iveness and comprehensiveness, by its clearness and 
force, it must be assigned a prominent place in 
American philosophy. 

Professor Borden P. Bowne's " Theory of 
Thought and Knowledge" is a slighter performance 
than the foregoing, and at the same time covers a 
wider field. Of the three divisions of philosophy 
logic, epistemology, and metaphysics this present 
book is a sketch of the first two divisions. By logic 
is meant, of course, not formal logic, but a philo- 
sophical discussion of notion, judgment, inference, 
deduction and induction, the categories, etc., in re- 
lation to truth ; in short, a general theory of thought 
in all its forms and functions. The last third of 
the book is taken up with the theory of knowledge. 
This opens with an analysis of philosophic scepticism, 
aimed to show the possibility of knowledge ; and 
the remaining chapters on " Thought and Thing," 
" Realism and Idealism," etc., seek to show just how

knowledge is possible, i. e., its fundamental con- 
ditions. Professor Bowne comes to much the same 
conclusions as Professor Ladd. While this work 
shows some acuteness and clearness, yet we cannot 
highly commend it as a whole. The treatment is 
much too summary, and the simplifying is carried 
too far. Further, the tone of the book is very 
unphilosophic by reason of gross dogmatism and 
didacticism, and the work is often marred by acad- 
emic sarcasm. 

Dr. John Bascom has lately added to his numerous 
volumes on religion and philosophy a brief work 
entitled " Evolution and Religion." He treats in 
this book of four main topics, namely, " Evolution 
as a Conception," " Evolution as Giving Unity to the 
Field of Knowledge and Action," " Evolution in its 
Present Spiritual Phases," and " Evolution in the 
Proofs it Offers to Spiritual Beliefs." Evolution is 
accepted in the widest sense, and is theistically and 
spiritually interpreted. Suggestive remarks are 
made on various ethical and social matters. The 
presentation is vigorous, popular, and rather ser- 
monic. While nothing very new is given, yet there 
is always originality of statement. The author is, 
throughout, very ironic, very sententious, and very 
enthusiastic. While the treatment is not especially 
profound or thorough, yet it is always broad and 
generous ; and there are many quickening thoughts 
which will be of service to those who are seeking to 
know the signs of the times and to adjust them- 
selves to a new spiritual basis. Many persons ought 
to find in this book help toward a larger, saner, and 
freer life. 

Mr. John Beattie Crozier follows up his work on 
" Civilization and Progress " by Volume I. of the 
" History of Intellectual Development," which, he 
explains, is to point out the laws of the evolution of 
religion, science, and philosophy. This is a very 
large and difficult task, and the author seems to 
show neither sufficient ability nor training for the 
work. Perhaps the quoting of a single sentence will 
give some inkling of the mental status of the writer : 
" I am aware, of course, of the deep suspicion with 
which many readers will regard any attempt to 
reduce to Law those products of thought or action 
which would seem to depend on the uncertain ca- 
prices of men ; and can fully realize the surprise of 
the reader when he hears that an attempt has here 
been made to anticipate the views which men like 
Plato, Aristotle, Buddha, or Paul were likely to hold 
on the great problems of the world and of human 
life." While this volume may be a passable com- 
pilation on the history of Greek, Hindu, and Judaic- 
Christian thought, and conceived in a broadly the- 
istic and Christian spirit, it is not a closely scientific 
study, and can scarcely be considered a serious con- 
tribution to historical or sociological literature. 

Professor Oswald Kiilpe's brief text-book on phil- 
osophy is now translated in a correct and convenient 
version by Professors Pillsbury and Titchener under 
the title " Introduction to Philosophy." This work 
is much more compendious and impersonal than 



Professor Paulsen's work with the same title. Pro- 
fessor Kttlpe aims to give the beginner " a short ac- 
count of the development and status of philosophy." 
Chapter I. is devoted to " the definition and classifi- 
cation of philosophy "; Chapter II. to " a survey of 
the separate disciplines which are now included under 
the general name of philosophy "; and Chapter III. to 
" a characterization of the more important schools of 
philosophic thought." The aim throughout has been 
" to assist the student in the understanding of lectures 
and treatises upon special philosophical topics." A 
final chapter gives very briefly the author's own 
view as to what philosophy should be and do in the 
future a view which discourages systems of phil- 
osophy. The standpoint of the book is too German, 
and the treatment, though clear, is too dry, to be very 
serviceable to the American student desiring an 
initiation to " divine philosophy." The profuse use 
of technical and German terms and the historical 
resume will embarrass many. The chief value of 
the work is as a reference book to help clarify the 
ideas of advanced students.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

A reconstructed The volume by Mr. Ignatius Singer 
trminoiyy and Mr. Lewis H. Berens, entitled 

Vphytic*. u Some Unrecognized Laws of Na- 

ture " (Appleton), offers to the physicist greatly 
varied interest. Seldom does one find propositions 
more clearly enunciated or more concisely and logi- 
cally discussed. Their exhaustive analysis holds 
attention and forces conclusions as to many of the 
terms and conventions of modern science, some of 
which have claimed the highest prerogative and have 
generally had their claims allowed. As an example 
may be cited the term "energy," with its derivatives 

" conservation " and " dissipation " of energy, 
kinetic energy, potential energy, etc. To Tail's 
definition of energy, "the power of doing work," 
the present authors do not object ; but to the idea 
that energy is a " distinct entity," even though " in- 
separable," they oppose serious and well-founded 
objections. There are those who seem to regard 
energy as a sort of soul residing in matter, but cap- 
able of unlimited transmigrations, having present 
existence, but resting under the possibility of disem- 
bodiment and final dissipation, perchance ending in 
a form of nirvana. But Tail's definition needs a re- 
striction ; energy is " the power of doing work " at 
a given instant, not a power which may have been, 
or, under conditions, may arrive. If a body be 
thrown vertically into the air, no energy may be 
attributed to it at the instant which ends its upward 
flight and begins its descent. When the object 
started upward it had power within itself to do work, 

work expended in lifting itself to an altitude. 
When its returning fall is finished, it has again ac- 
quired from the attraction of gravitation the energy 
perhaps to smash a casemate or to drive a timber

into the solid earth. A stone lying upon the earth's 
surface has in it no inherent " potential " energy ; 
nor would it acquire any if Mr. Frank Stockton were 
to bore beside it a hole ten miles deep. Like other 
reformers, our authors began with a revision of ter- 
minology. They affirm that certain psychologic ten- 
dencies disguise themselves in forms of expression, 
which tendencies are evil and must be overcome. 
Because suggestive of certain lines of theory, old 
terms must be discarded ; but may not the new terms 
be equally suggestive, and therefore reprehensible ? 
Thus, in an early chapter we find the fundamental 
term " inertia " dismissed, and its equivalent (?), 
" persistence," substituted. If equivalent, why sub- 
stitute ? But not only are the terms not equivalent, 
they are widely asunder. It is true that Newton 
uses the word persevere in his definition of vis insita, 
" a power of resistance by which everybody endeav- 
ors to persevere in its present state of rest or motion," 
etc. But in his further explanation of this defini- 
tion, in the same section, he says : " A body from 
the inactivity of matter is not without difficulty put 
out of its state of rest or motion. Upon which ac- 
count, this vis insita may, with a most significant 
name, be called vis inertice, or force of inactivity." 
Of the two terms offered by Newton, his disciples 
have used that which most perfectly indicates the 
normally inactive condition of matter, a condition 
which can neither initiate motion nor diminish motion 
when once acquired. It is a condition of absolute 
passivity. But perseverance, whether of matter or 
of the saints, and as these authors use the word, im- 
plies activity, with something like will or determin- 
ation. It is said that when King Wilhelm, the first 
German Kaiser, arrived in captured Paris, he re- 
marked, " Je suis ; je reste" Of thousands of the 
soldiers who had marched from the German frontier 
at the king's command, but had found their final 
resting place within French soil, it might have been 
said with equal truth, but with a very different 
signification, " They are here, and they will stay." 
The attitude of the conquering Kaiser was one of 
perseverance ; that of his buried Uhlans was one of 
inertia. But to discuss all the things, wise or 
otherwise, in this book would require another book. 

Among the sixteen chapters that con- 
stitute " A batch of Golfing Papers," 
written by Mr. Andrew Lang and 
others, and published by Mr. M. F. Mansfield, there 
is one, " The Devil's Round," a tale of Flemish Golf, 
that is almost like a piece of fine Valenciennes lace 
among a lot of good Scottish plaids. Not that the 
others are not good golfing papers : they are. But 
they lack the touch of literary quality, somehow. 
For instance, only fancy " Dr. Johnson on the Links," 
" Herodotus at Saint Andrews," " Socrates on the 
Links "; neither one of them could possibly be more 
than a few changes rung on a well-known theme. 
" A Song of Life and Golf " ( on the refrain " The 
Limmer stimied me"), and the "Ballade of the 
Duffer," these too, we think, might be imagined with

Lettert. 



sufficient exactness. "The Caddies at Saint Andrews" 
and " The Home of Golf " will not surprise or excite 
anyone already up in golfing literature. Of course 
they are good in their way ; they are quite the thing 
a man will read easily in a club corner in the even- 
ing after a good round. Or, now that as a rule one 
can't play the game, they will serve to remind. But 
they have no characters, they are only amusing 
because they are about golf. Now the particular 
story we speak of, a translation from the French of 
M. Charles Deulin, has not nearly so much to do 
with golf as the others, but it is a better story for all 
that. As you read it, you become conscious that 
you have moved out of that simple world whose 
sufficient humor comes from people's wrath at get- 
ting into bunkers, and whose acme of development 
would be a regular sequence of drive, approach, 
and putt. You are off the Links and have got 
back to Letters. The wheelwright's three wishes, 
his match with the Devil, his outwitting Death and 
even the good Saint Anthony, have the richness and 
cunning of peasant humor, and are worked out with 
the skill of a clever story-teller. We are fond of 
golf, and so we read the whole book with pleasure ; 
and we think most golfers will do so too. Still, our 
serious judgment is that it is best to keep Golf and 
Letters distinct and separate. If a man must read 
golf in the winter, the "Badminton" volume or 
Willie Parks's.book will be about the best thing for 
him, for these are pure golf and no literature. The 
stories in this volume are for the most part, it must 
be confessed, only half-and-half. As such, it is hard 
to see how they can make any real impression on a 
thoroughbred sport. Our Flemish tale, however, 
though it does not appeal so strongly to the golfing 
temperament, will certainly be remembered by any- 
one having more than a slight tincture of letters. 

Novelists search nowadays for curi- 
^ * and unheard-of heroes and hero- 

ines. Romances wherein Negro, 
Indian, Polynesian, and Hindu actors figure are 
rather in vogue. In France a popular story has 
already been written about prehistoric man. In 
Mr. Stanley Waterloo's " Story of Ab " (Way & 
Williams) we have a group of cave-dwellers as chief 
actors. In such a story, of course, the background 
must be realistic and the life true to nature. Mr. 
Waterloo appears to have made diligent efforts to 
qualify himself for writing his book. Some of his 
portrayals are clear and suggestive. Many mis- 
takes in archaeology occur, however. To cite but 
one, the whole treatment of the shell-heap men is 
wrong. Where are there fresh-water shell-heaps of 
Palaeolithic age? More than once Mr. Waterloo 
seems to imagine that he stands alone in claiming 
that there was no abrupt break between Palaeolithic 
and Neolithic cultures. Beddoe long ago asserted 
that the blood of Palaeolithic man still flows in British 
veins, and that individuals reproducing the ancient 
cave type may still be found ; Quatrefages held a 
similar view. As for archaeologists, a large num-

her, particularly in France, hold absolutely to the 
idea of continuity of culture. The best thing in the 
book, from the archaeologist's standpoint, is the em- 
phasizing of the importance of individual effort and 
discovery in prehistoric times : this is admirably 
brought out. Turning from the archaeology in the 
story to the book itself, we must admit that it is a 
strange one. The cover is a nightmare in black, 
yellow, and red. The author aims at Anglo-Saxon 
simplicity and at quaint combinations of unusual 
words. This is pleasant and odd for a time, but the 
reader finally wearies of strange uses of mumbling 
and thing. A fair example, taken almost at hap- 
hazard, of the style is the sentence, " To cross that 
morass safely required a touch on tussocks and an 
npbounding aside, a zigzag exhibition of great 
strength and knowingness and recklessness." This 
is no doubt ingenious. "We may adopt Mr. Water- 
loo's vocabulary and style, and say that it is a lush 
book, full of punkish crudity of things, thought 
products and word forms, fit to fall flatly on truly 
thoughtful. 

The world is made up of most various 
types, and it is just conceivable that 
there are persons to whom the fourth 
octavo volume of an ecclesiastical biography gives 
no suggestion of tedium. It is barely possible that 
four sound divines might conspire to make the work 
so readable that, as children cry for Castoria, so lay- 
minded folk would clamor for yet one volume more. 
The supposition is perhaps extreme, and the Life of 
Dr. Pusey is hardly a case in point. We have sought 
to examine it, at intervals, wakefully, with very 
moderate success. We presently came to feel that 
it was almost discourteous not to be drowsy in Dr. 
Pusey's company. We perceived how admirably 
Canon Liddon and his literary coadjutors had caught 
the tone of the subject of their biography, and how 
the whole work was, as artists say, in keeping. It 
was a wonderful group of men who favored or re- 
sisted the Oxford Movement. They range from 
Newman to Stanley, from Ward to Jowett, men full 
of life and character. Even in Manning, through 
the hard and fast shell of the ecclesiastic may now 
and then be seen the red blood beating. In Dr. 
Pusey also are microscopic traces of our common 
humanity. It is to the credit of his biographers to 
have discovered them. He was not only a saint in 
a niche, a painful controversialist, a hammerer of 
heretics, an automatic letter- writer, and a munificent 
church-benefactor. He was more. He could dis- 
tinguish between things that differ. Assisting a 
worn-out London vicar through an epidemic of 
cholera, it is told of Dr. Pusey that he insisted on 
waiting upon him at dinner, tempting him with 
special morsels, and with his own hands, as he poured 
it, frothing his beer. That last is a touch that 
brightens the picture. Could he have cared to have 
his own beer foaming? May we venture to con- 
template him as winking back at " the beaded bub- 
bles winking at the brim"? The conception is 



audacious, yet we must indulge it. For it lends one 
breath of fragrance, one suggestion of flesh and 
blood, to two thousand lifeless pages. (Longmans.) 

The series of " Literatures of the 
Wo ' ld " (Appleton), edited by Mr. 
Edmund Gosse, has now advanced to 
its second volume, Professor G. G. A. Murray's 
survey of Greek literature having been followed by 
Professor James Dowden's survey of French litera- 
ture. We have looked forward with much interest 
to the appearance of these books, for the production 
of a uniform series of accurate and readable histo- 
ries of the great national literatures is a very desir- 
able thing to undertake, and the successful accom- 
plishment of the task would mean much for popular 
culture. Professor Dowden's work, now before us, 
is all, or nearly all, that such a work might be ex- 
pected to be, and yet we have read it with a certain 
sense of disappointment. The plain truth of the 
matter is that a thousand years of rich literary his- 
tory cannot be made very interesting in a volume 
of a few hundred pages, from which all illustrative 
quotations must perforce be omitted for the sake of 
the history itself. There are so many names and 
books to be considered, and so little space in which 
to talk about them. Professor Dowden's book 
is probably as good a one as we should have the 
right to expect from any historian, and in sanity, 
balance, and literary expression is distinctly better 
than Professor Saintsbury's work, hitherto probably 
the best of its kind. Furthermore, there are many 
scattered pages which are really instructive, and 
may be read with much satisfaction. But for all 
that, the book must go to the reference shelf rather 
than to the library table. 

The "Handbook of American Au- 
J2ST22L thora," P^ared by Mr. Oscar Fay 

Adams, and published in 1884, was 
a very small book, very far from exhaustive, and 
by no means always accurate. Yet, in spite of its 
shortcomings, it has proved indispensable to every 
student of American literature, and has had no 
serious competitor short of the voluminous Allibone. 
There will be thousands of literary workers glad to 
learn that the book has at last grown into the " Dic- 
tionary of American Authors," just issued from the 
press of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It is now 
" fairly inclusive," as the editor remarks, for more 
than six thousand names are mentioned, and the 
work extends to 444 pages. The entries are, of 
course, very brief, aiming at little more than the 
name of each author, the place of birth, the dates 
of birth and death, the occupation, and the (undated ) 
titles of the books. Now and then we are given a 
few words' of criticism or a few bibliographical ref- 
erences. The editor has discriminated between 
" poets " and " verse-writers," an exercise of pre- 
rogative which may arouse the indignation of some 
members of the latter class, but which is surely well- 
advised. For example, Mr. Bliss Carman is a poet,

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



and Mr. Richard Hovey a verse-writer. Mr. Adams 
has been at great pains to state his facts concisely 
and accurately, and a somewhat close examination 
of the work has shown it to be remarkably free 
from errors, except such errors of omission as 
would characterize any work of this sort not com- 
piled by an archangel. 

Two essays in Bronte biography, by 
Mr - An S u8 M - Mackay, are com- 
prised in the volume entitled " The 
Brontes, Fact and Fiction" (Dodd, Mead & Co.). 
The longer of these is a successful attempt to prove 
Dr. Wright's " The Brontes in Ireland " to be un- 
trustworthy ; while the shorter, which appears now 
for the first time, is a sort of running commentary 
on Mr. Shorter's recently published "Charlotte 
Bronte and Her Circle." In the latter essay Mr. 
Mackay accepts most of Mr. Shorter's conclusions, 
although he differs from him on two important 
matters. The first of these is with regard to the 
religious opinions of Charlotte Bronte, which Mr. 
Mackay maintains wrongly, we think should be 
characterized as " Broad Church." The second is 
in reference to Charlotte Bronte's relations with 
M. He*ger. Here he adopts the thesis, which we 
are inclined to accept, that the story about Charlotte 
being in love with her talented master is true. He 
then explains how this may not in itself be discred- 
itable to the character of the novelist. As this is 
the fullest discussion of this mooted matter we have 
seen, we recommend the book to anyone who may 
be interested in the Bronte' group. We wish to add, 
however, that Mr. Mackay's Bronte enthusiasm does 
not seem always to be tempered with sanity. This 
is shown in his acceptance of Lockhart's extrava- 
gant praise of Charlotte Bronte, and in his yielding 
to the latter the supremacy over Jane Austen and 
George Eliot. 

A pleasant The ^ ve Frenchmen to whom Miss 

acquaintance with Mary Fisher introduces us in " A 
tome French critics. Group of French Critics " (McClurg) 
are Edmond Scherer, Ernest Bersot, Saint-Marc 
Girardin, Xime'nes Doudan, and Gustave Planche. 
Though they are of very unequal importance and 
stand in many respects in strong contrast with one 
another, the group derives a sort of coherence from 
their agreement in a serious and intelligent treat- 
ment of literature as one of the great permanent 
human interests, and in a cool and conservative atti- 
tude toward new literary fashions. They respect 
and cherish the long results of human experience; 
they enforce the distinction between bad and good 
literature ; they maintain that an art that works in 
a material so preeminently moral as human conduct 
cannot be rightly indifferent to moral issues. This 
volume is the outgrowth of the author's admiration 
for this kind of criticism, and of a desire to make 
its qualities better known among us. Her purpose 
is not to expound or discuss the history or the meth- 
ods of French criticism, but to set the person of the 



critic before us and let him speak for himself, not 
in complete essays but in extracts that are character- 
istic of his personality and his point of view. This 
purpose has been fairly realized. If we in no wise 
make the complete round of any of these critics, we 
manage to get an interesting and instructive glimpse 
of each, and many will wish to pursue further the 
acquaintanceship thus begun. 



Napoleon's 
art of war. 



The ordinary reader who has passed 
the fighting enthusiasm of his youth 
is not greatly interested in special 
military history.- Disgust at the barbarity of war 
destroys interest in it as a game of skill, while one need 
not follow the details of a battle or a campaign to ap- 
preciate its historical importance. But the mature 
civilian will find Lieut. H. H. Sargent's " The Cam- 
paign of Marengo" (McClurg), with comments, 
both interesting and profitable reading. The horrors 
are veiled; the drum and trumpet are not brought 
out ; but the campaign is treated as a magnificent 
game of science and skill, so explained that the 
untrained reader can follow it even though he can- 
not appreciate fully the quality of the skill displayed. 
The author's method is to take up each part of the 
campaign in a chapter, giving first a narrative of it 
and then comments and criticism. A chapter of 
general comment follows, in which the author ranks 
Napoleon as easily first among soldiers, the equal of 
any as an organizer and a tactician, and the great- 
est of all in strategy. Indeed, the book may be con- 
sidered as a discussion in little of Napoleon's art 
of war. 

For busy pastors with limited purses, 
for Bible-class teachers, leaders of 
young people's meetings, and mis- 
sionary studies, Mr. E. M. Bliss's "Concise History 
of Missions" (F. H. Re veil) is admirable. It has 
the limitations of a " short cut " presentation of a 
vast subject, but the brief and select bibliography 
will guide the reader to more extended discussions. 
The little volume sketches missions of the early 
church, of the Roman Catholics, early Protestants, 
British, American, and European. Then he turns 
to the field, and outlines the characteristics and 
peculiar needs of various countries, North and 
South America, Africa, the Levant, India, South- 
eastern Asia, China, Japan, Korea, the Pacific. In 
the last part the author discusses organization and 
methods. 

Dean Farrar's restless pen still pro- 
duces readable books. His latest, 
"Men I Have Known" (Croweli), 
is a unique compilation. The Dean has sought and 
cultivated an acquaintance with many of the leading 
English-speaking authors, churchmen, and scientists 
of his day. In this volume he spreads before us 
charming bits of reminiscences of some of these 
great lights. We are told in detail how he became 
acquainted with, and how he improved and enjoyed 
the companionship of, several eminent men. This

Missions.

Dean Farrar

25 



book of 292 pages sketches in a personal way such 
acquaintanceship some slight and some intimate 
of fifty-six Englishmen and Americans. In addi- 
tion to the Dean's personal memoirs there are many 
facsimile reproductions of autograph letters which 
the author has received at some time or other. Of 
especial interest to many will be the half-tone full- 
page portraits of twenty-five men. Some of the less 
widely known yet highly prized pictures are those 
of F. D. Maurice, Dr. Thomson of York, Archbishop 
Benson, Canon Liddon, Dean Plumptree, and Dr. 
Jowett. Though the book is strongly seasoned with 
Ego, it will be heartily welcomed by the ecclesias- 
tical and biblical public, as giving us another kaleido- 
scopic view of some of the men about whom we are 
always anxious to learn more. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have published some 
" Selected Poems by George Meredith " in a volume so 
exquisite in design and mechanical execution that the 
most fanatical of Meredithians could ask for nothing 
worthier. We are told that the selection has been 
made under the author's personal supervision, a method 
which is usually more interesting than satisfactory. At 
any rate, in the present case it gives us "Juggling 
Jerry " and does not give us the magnificent ode to 
France " in the hour of her agony, thus illustrating 
anew the fact that a poet is usually a poor judge of his 
own productions. In fact, the selection as a whole 
slights the simple and fresh work of the author's earlier 
years for the sake of the contortions and grotesque 
affectations of his later style. A worse service than 
this could hardly be done him even by the most superior 
person among his small but devoted following. 

The " Poems of Thomas Hood " (Macmillan), edited 
by the Rev. Alfred Ainger, have been published in two 
volumes of the ever-charming " Eversley " form, and 
all students of literature and readers of poetry must be 
grateful for the attractiveness of the publication, as 
well as for the scholarly care which the editor has ex- 
pended upon the memoir, the notes, and the text itself. 
The first volume contains the " Serious Poems," and the 
second a selection (perhaps two-thirds of the whole) 
from the " Poems of Wit and Humor " that Hood pro- 
duced so copiously for the " Comic Annuals " and other 
ephemeral publications. Hood was not so great a poet 
as to make it desirable to preserve with scrupulous care 
every scrap of his writing, and the editor is quite justified 
in having used his discretion in this matter. 

The " Shakespeare Note- Book" (Ginn) is a blank book 
with proper headings and divisions for the convenience 
of students in making memoranda for ready reference 
to the items which are considered of most importance in 
the study of the plays. The first three pages are given 
to printed matter condensed from Dowden's "Shaks- 
pere Primer," in relation to such points as chronological 
order, classification by types, reference books, etc. 

Mr. William S. Walsh, the compiler of a popular 
" Handy-Book of Literary Curiosities," has just supplied 
that entertaining work with a companion volume, entit- 
led " Curiosities of Popular Customs" (Lippincott), and 
dealing with all sorts of rites, ceremonies, and festivities 
familiar to the folklorist. Such compilations as these 



supplement the conventional encyclopaedias in a very ac- 
ceptable way, and are useful both for reference and for 
miscellaneous reading. How many know off-hand, for 
example, what is the ceremony of " Cutting of the 
Khalig," or can discourse upon the " Blood- Tax in the 
Pyrennes." Mr. Walsh's book is for those who do not 
know such things, but would like to know them. 

A few months ago we noticed in THE DIAL (July 1) 
Mr. Frank M. Chapman's " Bird-Life," a volume con- 
taining " as much information regarding a hundred or 
more of our familiar birds as could be compressed 
within its limits." The work lacked but one feature 
colored plates representing the birds as they appear in 
life; and this feature has now been supplied in a new 
edition just issued by Messrs. Appleton & Co. There 
are seventy-five full-page colored plates, so well done 
that we can emphasize our previous commendation, 
"The student who selects this work as a guide to his 
observations of bird-life will not go amiss." 

Philip II. of Spain is the subject of a volume, by 
Mr. Martin A. S. Hume, in the "Foreign Statesmen 
Series " (Macmillan). Those who have had the good 
fortune to become acquainted with Mr. Hume's earlier 
studies in the history of England and Spain in the six- 
teenth and seventeenth centuries, and who remember 
especially the few paragraphs given in one of his essays 
to an estimate of the character of Philip II., will know 
how valuable and readable an extended biography of 
Philip from his pen must be. Nothing of its kind exists 
in English. It may be unhesitatingly and highly praised. 

Dr. William H. Griffis's " The Romance of Discov- 
ery " (Wilde & Co.) is really a general account of 
American discovery from the time of the Norsemen to 
the present; and it is particularly designed for young 
people. However, the story is too summary and too 
obviously inade-to-order to be of the highest interest to 
either young or old. The volume contains some good 
illustrations, but lacks a map. 

The third quinquennial supplement to " Poole's Index 
to Periodical Literature " (Houghton), edited by Messrs. 
William I. Fletcher and Franklin O. Poole, with the 
cooperation of the American Library Association, has 
just made its appearance. It is a bulky volume of over 
six hundred quarto pages, that is, about one-third more 
voluminous than either of its predecessors. The num- 
ber of sets of periodicals covered is one hundred and 
eighty-seven, sixty of which have not been included in 
any previous issue. Of the latter, forty-two have had 
their origin since 1891. On the other hand, twenty- 
three sets represented in the list of five years ago have 
been dropped. As is eminently fitting, this volume con- 
tains a portrait of William Frederick Poole, and a brief 
sketch of his industrious and useful life. 

The volume for 1897 of "American Book- Prices 
Current," compiled from the auctioneers' catalogues by 
Mr. Luther S. Livingston, has just been published by 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead, & Co. It is a volume of five 
hundred and fifty pages, and the edition is limited to six 
hundred copies. The record is based upon sales made 
hi New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Cin- 
cinnatti, for the year ending with last August. The 
general rule has been to include accurately described 
lots bringing three dollars and upwards, which means 
over eight thousand entries in the present case. The 
highest price of the year was 81250, paid for an edition 
of the "Book of Common Prayer," dated 1788, and 
having considerable autograph and ownership interest 
connected with it.

LITERARY NOTES. 

An outline " Sketch of Jewish History," translated 
from the German of Dr. Gustav Karpeles, has just been 
sent out by the Jewish Publication Society of America. 
Mr. Henry Frowde announces for early publication in 
America " The Bible References of John Ruskin," 
selected and arranged by Misses Mary and Ellen 
Gibbs. 

The J. B. Lippincott Co. publish " A History of the 
United States of America, Its People, and its Institu- 
tions," a work by Mr. Charles Morris, intended for use 
as a school text-book. 

The Macmillan Co. publish, in a single volume of 
their excellent " Globe " edition, " The Poetical Works 
of Elizabeth Barrett Browning," with portrait, and an 
introduction by Mr. F. G. Kenyon. 

" The Beginning, Progress, and Conclusion of Bacon's 
Rebellion in Virginia, in the Years 1675 and 1676 " is 
the December number of the "American Colonial 
Tracts," published by Mr. G. P. Humphrey. 

Messrs. Hinds & Noble publish, in their " University 
Tutorial " series, a third and enlarged edition of Mr. 
John S. Mackenzie's " Manual of Ethics," a work that 
has met with much success as a college text book. 

Mr. Charles A. Bramble's book " Klondike " (Fenno 
& Co.) is a compilation, largely from the newspapers, 
but apparently serviceable to those wishing a practical 
knowledge of the Klondike gold fields and how to get 
there. 

A belated holiday publication is Mr. Sydney George 
Fisher's interesting work on " Men, Women, and Man- 
ers in Colonial Times." The work is in two volumes, 
attractively illustrated, and sent out in a neat box by the 
J. B. Lippincott Co. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. have issued a new 
edition of their well-known " Portrait Catalogue." The 
number of portraits has been increased to sixty-three, 
and all are entirely new, having been made especially 
for this edition of the catalogue. 

Volume XVIII. of "Harper's Round Table" is a 
stout quarto of nearly thirteen hundred pages, abun- 
dantly illustrated. It contains no less than eight com- 
plete serial stories, besides its hundreds of other fea- 
tures interesting to young people. 

The Jewish Chautauqua Society of Philadelphia sends 
us an interesting syllabus of a reading course in " Jew- 
ish History and Literature," covering the period of 
" The Crusades and the Spanish Era," and prepared 
under the direction of Professor Richard Gottheil. 

Mr. Frederic G. Kenyon is about to publish, through 
the Oxford University Press, the text of the recently 
discovered poems of Bacchylides. The editor will 
furnish an introduction and commentary, while the 
fragments will be printed in both ordinary and uncial 
type. 

" Rampolli " is the title given to a volume by the 
Rev. George MacDonald, just published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. It contains a sheaf of trans- 
lations in verse, mostly from the German, and one long 
original poem, entitled "A Year's Diary of an Old 
Soul." 

Mr. George Laurence Gomme has undertaken to edit 
a " Library of Historical Novels and Romances," which 
are to be published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
The first two volumes of this series, just issued, are 



Bulwer's well-known " Harold," and Charles Macfar- 
lane's little-known romance " The Camp of Refuge." 
The editor contributes an elaborate introduction to each 
volume, together with illustrations (the Bayeux tapestry, 
for instance) and notes. 

Mr. Fisher Unwin is about to publish in England 
(and we shall doubtless soon have it in this country) a 
work on " Modern France," written by M. Andre* Lebon 
for the " Story of the Nations " series. This will pre- 
cede even its appearance in the country and language 
of its origin. 

Two bound volumes of " St. Nicholas," embracing the 
whole of the year 1897, and the semi-annual bound vol- 
ume of " The Century Magazine," have found their way 
to our table, as usual at this time of year, from the 
offices of the Century Co. They are quite as full of good 
things as ever, and it would be invidious to attempt to 
particularize. 

Ex-President Cleveland's address at the Princeton 
Sesquicentennial is published by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell 
& Co. as a booklet with the title " The Self-Made Man in 
American Life." It is just the sort of thing for young 
men to read, with its homely, yet fijiely impressive plea 
for ideals of a sort too often neglected in our rushing 
American life. 

In a very thin volume some nameless one, who may 
be a great authority, gives a final settlement to a series 
of problems whose mere titles occupy about seven pages 
in the table of contents. " Posterity, or, Democracy in 
A. D. 2100 " (Putnam) has hints of Looking Back- 
ward." If one could be sure of only one of these solu- 
tions he would be willing to read a longer book. 

Two mites are contributed to the growing mass of 
text-book literature by instructors in the Chicago High 
Schools. Mr. Harry Nightingale has edited for Messrs. 
Ainsworth & Co. a pamphlet of " Selections from Wash- 
ington, Lincoln, and Bryant," and Mr. Fred. L. Charles 
has published on his own account a pamphlet guide to 
the young geologist, entitled " How to Read a Pebble." 
We have received a little pamphlet entitled " Nick- 
names and Pseudomyms of Prominent People," com- 
piled by Mrs. Fannie Parmelee Deane, Holyoke, Mass. 
Among the " prominent people " listed are those ancient 
ladies, the nine Muses. We also learn that one Quintus 
Fabius was also known as Crunctator. The booklet 
does not seem to have been edited with much discrim- 
ination. 

Bishop Creighton's " History of the Papacy from the 
Great Schism to the Sack of Rome " has for some years 
occupied a place among the standard productions of 
English historical scholarship. Many students will be 
grateful to Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., the his- 
torian's publishers, for the neat new edition of this work, 
just published in six volumes, and at a price materially 
lower than that at which the history has heretofore been 
issued. 

A well-printed volume comes to us from Mr. William 
Doxey, of San Francisco, and contains the " Sonnets of 
Jos^-Maria de Heredia," done into English by Mr. 
Edward Robeson Taylor. To translate M. Heredia at 
all is to attempt the impossible, and Mr. Taylor, if he 
is to be congratulated upon his ambition, cannot be con- 
gratulated upon his work, which is entirely inadequate, 
besides giving evidence of an imperfect knowledge of 
the French language. 

It is a singular fact that the English language has 
yet to await a good, an even tolerable, complete transla- 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



tion of the " Origines " of Kenan. A good beginning 
has at last been made by Messrs. Roberts Brothers, who 
some time ago published Mr. Joseph Henry Allen's 
translation of the " Life of Jesus," and who now issue a 
translation of " Anti-Christ," made by the same com- 
petent hand. It is to be hoped that the other five vol- 
umes will follow in equally satisfactory versions. 

Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., who have given us so many 
pretty editions of English authors, have surpassed them- 
selves in their " Waverley " novels, the first of which has 
just been placed on sale by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons, who import the edition for the American market. 
Thin but reasonably opaque paper makes possible the 
combination of readable print with a very small volume. 
There are to be forty of them altogether, with facsimile 
title-pages, bibliographical notes, and illustrations, each 
volume daintily bound in lambskin. 

A movement of an international character has been 
started among the friends and admirers of the late Pro- 
fessor J. J. Sylvester for the purpose of " founding a 
suitable memorial in honour of his name and for the en- 
couragement of mathematical science." The memorial 
is to take the form of a " Sylvester Medal," to be 
awarded at certain intervals for mathematical research 
to any worker, irrespective of nationality. It has been 
estimated that $5000 will be needed for the proposed 
endowment, of which sum about one-half has already 
been subscribed in England. American subscriptions 
may be sent to either Dr. Cyrus Adler, of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, Washington, or to Dr. George Bruce 
Halsted, 2407 Guadalupe St., Austin, Texas. 

Through some inadvertence in the publication of Dr. 
J. H. Barrows's recent work on " Christianity, the World- 
Religion," Dr. Barrows is made to appear as the " Presi- 
dent and originator " of the Parliament of Religions held 
in Chicago during the World's Fair. The phrase is in- 
correct and misleading, and has given rise to a misappre- 
hension which has somewhat widely extended. Those 
at all familiar with the facts are aware that the Parlia- 
ment of Religions was a part of the grand series of 
World's Congresses held in official connection with the 
World's Fair. There were over two hundred of these 
separate Congresses, each organized and held under the 
direction of a committee whose chairman was the ex- 
ecutive head of that particular congress; and this was 
precisely Dr. Barrows's relation to the Religious Con- 
gress, or the Parliament of Religions. There was but 
one President, Mr. C. C. Bonney; and he was the prime 
originator and director of the Congresses as a whole, and 
in a very special sense of the Congress of Religions, 
which at first met with no little disfavor but in the end 
proved the most successful and notable of the series. 
Dr. Barrows's splendid services in procuring this result 
are too widely known and appreciated to need any over- 
statement in his behalf; and no one has been more em- 
phatic than he in recognizing the preeminence of Mr. 
Bonney as the originator and director of the Congresses. 
In an article in " The Forum " (Sept. 1894) Dr. Bar- 
rows said: " Charles C. Bonney, a broad-minded lawyer 
of Chicago, is entitled to the great and lasting honor of 
having originated and carried to success, in spite of 
numerous obstacles, the entire scheme of the World's 
Congresses of 1893. The Parliament of Religions was 
one of more than two hundred of these conventions; 
and was, according to Mr. Bonney, ' the splendid crown ' 
of the series." In his " History of the Parliament of 
Religions," also, Dr. Barrows has made the facts qnite 
clear as we have stated them.

CULTURED PEOPLE 

Who are particular as to the class of reading 
matter that goes into their homes, and realize 
the importance of admitting only such publica- 
tions as maintain a high standard and elevated 
tone, are invited to try for 1898 the three pub- 
lications which, in a city where commercial and 
material affairs have long held sway, are working 
in the interests of higher intelligence and culture, 
and have won a position in their respective fields 
second to none in America. These papers are : 

THE CHICAGO EVENING POST. 

" THE CHICAGO EVENING POST bears the same rela- 
tion to the Chicago press that The New York Evening 
Post bears to the press of that city that is to say, it 
is a daily paper of the highest class, and appeals for its 
constituency to the best classes of people, and is there- 
fore free from sensationalism and from any pandering 
to ignorance, prejudice, or vice." The Interior, Chicago. 

THE CHAP-BOOK. 

" Chicago's handsome CHAP-BOOK . . . has estab- 
lished itself as the most amusing, the most readable, of 
American literary periodicals. . . . THE CHAP-BOOK 
is to be congratulated on the intelligence, the freedom 
from prejudice, which marks its literary judgments, and 
on the fact that it can hold itself uninfluenced even before 
the greatest names in fiction." Kansas City Star.

A HINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS. 

FOR THE PRESENT HOLIDAY SEASON, Book-lovers have the chance to 
procure for gift purposes such a literary treasure as was never before seen. To Mr. Charles 
Dudley Warner, as its editor-in-chief, belongs the palm of victory for this achievement in book 
production. The " Library of the World's Best Literature," as it has been happily named, 
might also fitly be termed the world's crowning effort in the creation of books. 

Either praise or minute description of this magnificent work would seem almost needless 
to a public that has read its eulogy, since the appearance of the very first volume, in all the 
chief literary periodicals of the country. Just here may be noted briefly the principal features 
that constitute the Library a work of surpassing excellence for profit and enjoyment : 

CRITICAL ESSAYS. About a thousand graphic essays, by living scholars and 
writers of eminence, furnish in popular style their critical, interpretative, biographical, and 
historical comments on the world's great authors and their principal works, alike of ancient and 
modern times. In every one of these the critic is also a specialist in relation to his subject. 

SELECTED LITERATURE. Following the interpretative studies are presented 
the master productions of the most famous writers of all ages and countries. The collection 
includes Poetry, History, Romance, Oratory, Biography, Science and Philosophy, Theology, 
Letters, Drama, Wit and Humor, and every other form of literary expression. 

HISTORY OF LITERATURE. The Library contains histories of all the world's 
literatures, ancient and modern, written in each case by a specialist who is recognized as author- 
ity on the subject. The sacred books of the nations also form special studies. 

SYNOPSIS OF BEST BOOKS. Three thousand of the world's best books are 
separately analyzed and given in clear synopsis of narrative, plot, and characters. Refreshes 
our past reading and guides to that of the future. 

BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY. The most complete and accurate dictionary of 
the lives of great authors ever made. It embraces 12,000 names and gives under each all 
essential facts and literary successes. 

INDEX. The most elaborate and careful ever yet compiled for a work of magnitude. 
It indexes by reference and cross-reference every name, event, book, selection, topic and senti- 
ment treated of on any page of the Library. An immense boon to literary workers. Such 
are the chief features that distinguish the "Library of the World's Best Literature." But 
they are not all. There are others that serve to make it as helpful to the student and scholar 
as it is bright and entertaining for mere intellectual recreation. 

FOR THESE HOLIDAYS ONLY, 

Not for those of next year or the years to follow, can the LIBRARY be obtained at the excep- 
tionally low price now made available through the Harper's Weekly Club. This was only 
established as an introductory figure to enable the public to learn the merits and value of the 
work. THE PRICE is TO BE ADVANCED AFTER NEW YEAR'S DAY. None should miss the 
present opportunity to secure full particulars under the exceptionally advantageous offer made 
for the month of December to all who become members of the Harper's Weekly Club.

PUBLISH TO-MORROW: 

A History of the United States for Schools. 

By WILBUR F. GORDY, Principal of the North School, Hartford, Conn. With about 300 illustrations and 

maps. 8vo, $1.00 net. 

Professor Gordy is widely known in educational circles as a successful teacher, particularly of history, and as the 
co-author of "A Pathfinder in American History." He has here written a history of our country, for use in schools, 
which is eminently in advance of its predecessors in clearness of arrangement, in presenting the essentials in a way that 
will most surely appeal to the child, and in omitting or lessening in importance the mass of matter irrelevant to the real 
record of our nation's growth. The work is abundantly illustrated and contains most suggestive hints to teachers and 
pupils alike. 



The Oxford Manuals of English 
History. 

Edited by C. W. C. OMAN, M.A., F.S.A., Fellow of All

with map, genealogies, and index. Each 50 cts. net. 

Prof. E. P. CHBTJTET, of the University of Pennsylvania, says: 

" Small aa they are and elementary in appearance, I am not at all sure 

that they are not exactly what we want for college nse something 

that will give the principal facts in sufficiently scholarly selection, 

arrangement, and form, and yet be short enough to allow the student 

plenty of time for collateral reading and attention to the matter of 

the lectures."

A National Church. 

By WILLIAM REED HUNTTNGTON, D.D., Rector of Grace 
Church, New York. (The Bedell Lectures for 1897.) 
12mo. pp. 109, 81.00. 

Dr. Hunt ington here presents with force and clearness his views on 
the theory and the practicability of a National Church with special 
reference to our own country. He names as the three " watchwords 
of unity ": In the field of Dogma, theological and ethical, Condensa- 
tion; in the field of Polity, Co-ordination; in the field of Worship, 
Clattiflcation. The chief stumbling-blocks to unity he finds to be 
" Sacramental Theology, the value of historicity in connection with 
Holy Orders, and the Sacramental Order of Worship." The first of 
these questions is minutely discussed in an appendix, and there are 
other appendices devoted to " The Place of Temperament in Religion," 
and " a Bibliography of Irenic Literature, American and English." 



The Significance of the Westminster Standards as a Creed. 

By BENJAMIN B. WARFIELD, D.D., Professor of Theology in Princeton University. 12mo, 75 cents. 

The recent celebration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the framing of the Westminster Standards has 
awakened a widespread interest in these venerable documents. Dr. Warfield's book, which the Outlook declares " able and 
brilliantly written," describes the historical circumstances of the origin and the resulting character and contents of this 
statement of belief by the Presbyterian fathers.

" A publishing year notable for important biographies is not to be 
allowed to close without one American contribution to the list. The 
Scribners are to publish this week what will be practically a new Life 
of Audubon. It is the work of Audubpn's grand-daughter, with anno- 
tation of Elliott Coues, and will contain Audubon's journals complete 
for the first time (a part come to light by a happy accident in 1896), 
together with . . . three bird drawings not produced hitherto. In 
these days of widespread interest hi bird-lore, and of numberless 
Audubon societies, the first full and authentic record of their patron 
saint should prove a most valuable publication." N. T. Evening Pott.

"The result of a woman's faultless taste collaborating with a man's 
technical knowledge. Its mission is to reveal to the hundreds who 
have advanced just far enough to find that they can go no farther 
alone, truth lying concealed below the surface. It teaches that con- 
summate taste is satisfied only with a perfected simplicity ; that the 
facades of a house must be the envelope of the rooms within, and 
adapted to them as the rooms themselves are to the habits and require- 
ments of ' those who dwell therein '; that proportion is the backbone 
of the decorator's art ; and that supreme elegance is fitness and mod- 
eration ; and, above all, that an attention to architectural principles 
can alone lead decoration to a perfect development." New York 
Evening Post.

Cloth, 16mo, 75 cts. 
The two courses of exercises in Rhe- 
toric and English Composition -which 
Prof. Carpenter has prepared for high 
school and college classes are so plain, 
practical, and sensible that teachers who 
have used them look for this new Gram- 
mar with unusual interest.

By EDWARD BRADFORD TITCHENER, 
Ph.D., Cornell University, author of 
"An Outline of Psychology." 

Cloth, 16mo. Nearly Beady 
This volume is intended as a first book 
in psychology. It aims to outline, with 
no more of technical detail than accu- 
racy requires, the methods and most 
important results of modern psychology, 
and to furnish the reader with references 
for further study. It is written with 
direct regard for the needs of Normal 
and High Schools, but is comprehensive 
enough to give the general reader a fair 
idea of the present status of psychology 
in all its branches. 



HISTORY. 

A Student's History of the

History, Harvard University, author

This work is primarily designed for 
the use of students in the last year of 
the High School ; but can readily be 
adapted to the needs of lower grades. 
The volume is equipped with an appara- 
tus of topics, references, and suggestive 
questions which will enable any teacher 
to adopt the better methods of teaching 
history, which a few colleges already 
encourage by their requirements for 
admission.

"It would be scarcely possible for 
French history to be set before edu- 
cated men in so small a compass more 
skilfully, more graphically, or more 
thoroughly in accord with the results of 
recent investigation ; certainly no En- 
glish history of France of the same size 
can compare with it for accuracy or in- 
terest." English Historical Review.

cultural College of Michigan. 

Cloth, 12mo, $1.1O

methods of nature study, not to present 
facts. They aim to suggest interesting

senting the subject. A briefer volume, 
containing twenty lessons reprinted from 
this book, can also be had. 

NATURE STUDY.

Elementary Schools. 

By Mrs. L. L. W. WILSON, Ph.D., Phila- 
delphia Normal School. Two vol- 
umes. 

Reader. In Press 
Manual. Cloth, 9O cts. net 
For the Manual for Teachers, Col. 
Francis W. Parker's Preface says : 

"The pressing need of the hour is 
genuine students of education, teachers 
who bring to every child and every sub- 
ject a mind full of desire to know, an 
abiding faith in boundless possibilities, 
a freshness of spirit that is in itself the 
most potent factor in education, a devo- 
tion that inspires new contributions to 
the unlimited science of teaching. This 
book is such a contribution, and I am 
sure it will be a great help to many 
teachers who are struggling with the 
problem of Nature Study."

animals, etc., most familiar to them.

ENERGY AND AST. 



Mr. Swinburne speaks somewhere of the dis- 
tinction, which yet amounts to " no mutually 
exclusive division," between the gods and the 
giants of literature. Practically the same dis- 
tinction is made by his friend, Mr. Theodore 
Watts-Dunton, in the statement, which recurs 
frequently in the writings of the latter critic, 
to the effect that poetic energy and poetic art 
are " the two forces that move in the produc- 
tion of all poetry." The distinction is illumi- 
nating for the understanding of poetry, for 
these two forces are the fundamental elements 
of the effective appeal of literature, as, indeed, 
of all the forms of artistic endeavor. In the 
greatest of poets, to be sure, we find the two 
forces to coexist in such supreme degree and 
perfect balance that they become, as it were, 
merely the two aspects of the phenomenon 
which we call genius, and we understand that 
for the highest achievements of literature the 
one is but the necessary complement of the 
other. This is what we find in Shakespeare 
and Dante and Pindar, possibly also in Goethe 
and Milton. But when we view the work of 
the poets who just escape inclusion in the small 
company of the supreme singers of the world, 
we nearly always discover some preponderance 
of energy over art or of art over energy. As 
coming under the latter category, for example, 
we think of Sophocles and Virgil and Tenny- 
son ; while the former category embraces 
2Eschylus and Lucretius and Victor Hugo. 
Taking a step still further away from the great 
masters, we meet with such fairly antipodal 
contrasts as are offered by Horace and Juvenal, 
by Spenser and Jonson, or by Keats and Byron. 
In these cases we have either art so finished 
that the energy has become potential, or energy 
so unrestrained that the art has been well-nigh 
ignored. 

This thought may profitably be pursued into 
the domain of prose literature, and even, as 
was above suggested, into the field of the fine 
arts in general. The noblest prose that of 
Plato, for example has the same balance of 
energy and art that is displayed by the noblest 
poetry. On the other hand, we have tremen- 
dous energy with but scant art in such a writer 



36 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



as Carlyle, well-nigh perfect art with but little 
energy in such a writer as Landor. In archi- 
tecture, the Gothic style astonishes us with its 
energy, the classic style entrances us with its 
art. In sculpture, the one type is represented 
by Michel Angelo, the other by Thorwaldsen. 
In painting, the predominance of energy in 
Tintoretto is as unquestionable as the predomi- 
nance of art in Raphael. And in music, while 
Bach and Beethoven stand for the Shakes- 
pearian harmony of both forces in their highest 
development, we may easily discern the over- 
plus of energy in Liszt and Tschaikowsky, of 
art in Gluck and Mozart. The broad distinc- 
tion between the classic and the romantic styles, 
which runs through all the arts, is, moreover, 
to a considerable extent, the distinction between 
these two primary forces under other names. 

In a recent number of "The Athenaeum" 
there are some interesting remarks upon this 
subject as it is related to literary criticism, re- 
marks in which it would be an affectation to 
pretend not to recognize the hand of Mr. 
Watts-Dunton. " It would be unseemly here 
to criticize contemporary criticism, but it may, 
without intending offense, be said that while 
the appreciation of poetry as an energy is as 
strong as ever in the criticism of the present 
day, the appreciation of poetry as an art is 
non-existent, except in one or two quarters 
which we need not indicate. . . . To go no 
further back than the time when Rossetti's 
poems were published, compare the critical 
canons then in vogue with the critical canons 
of the present day. On account of a single 
cockney rhyme, the critics of that period would 
damn a set of verses in which perhaps a meas- 
ure of poetic energy was not wanting. The 
critics of to-day fall for the most part into 
two classes : those who do not know what is 
meant by a cockney rhyme, and those who love 
a cockney rhyme." If this is true, it is a 
serious matter, for we are not content to share 
the non-committal position of the writer, who 
confines himself to saying : "We merely record 
an interesting and suggestive fact of literary 
history. If in poetical criticism the wisdom 
of one generation is the folly of the next, it is 
the same in everything man says and in every- 
thing he does, so whimsical a creature has the 
arch-humorist Nature set at the top of the 
animal kingdom." 

For our part, we believe that the appreciation 
of poetry as an art is essential to the very ex- 
istence of criticism, and are far from willing 
to admit that it is non-existent at the present 



day. It is true enough that a great deal of 
verbiage about poetry issues from the " blind 
mouths " of self-constituted critics who know 
not whereof they speak ; but that has always 
been the case. Our writer himself makes the 
saving admission that the art of poetry still 
finds appreciation " in one or two quarters 
which we need not indicate," and that is prob- 
ably all that might be said of the criticism of 
Rossetti's time, or of a still earlier generation. 
When we are well along into the twentieth 
century, it is precisely the criticism from these 
unindicated quarters that will alone survive, 
and will urge the writers of that period in 
turn to say things about the decay of criticism 
in their own time. The ineptitudes of the 
criticism that greeted the early work of Keats 
and Shelley, of Wordsworth and Tennyson, 
were surely as unfortunate as any utterances 
of the present day, and, what is particularly to 
the point, they were lacking in precisely that 
appreciation of poetry as art for which Mr. 
Watts-Dunton seeks almost in vain in our 
current critical literature. 

Having entered this protest against a state- 
ment that seems altogether too sweeping, we 
are now prepared to admit that a good many 
present-day facts lend countenance to the con- 
tention. Popular opinion naturally cares more 
for energy than for art in literature, for the 
obvious reason that it is stirred by the one and 
not easily susceptible to the appeal of the other. 
It feels the power of Browning, for example, 
and, although by long familiarity made dimly 
conscious of the exquisite art of Tennyson, is 
disposed to allow the one quality to offset the 
other, and consider the two as equally great 
poets. It is the same rough-and-ready sort of 
judgment that for a long time held Byron to be 
a greater poet than Wordsworth, that in our own 
time thinks of Tolstoi as a greater master of 
fiction than Tourguenieff , or that made Juvenal 
seem a greater poet than Yirgil to the indi- 
vidual idiosyncrasy of Hugo, or Wordsworth 
and even Byron greater poets than Shelley to 
the individual idiosyncrasy of Matthew Arnold. 
It is the sort of judgment that reaches the cul- 
mination of extravagance in the things that are 
sometimes said about Walt Whitman by the 
injudicious among his admirers. When we 
consider that Whitman's verses are not even 
what the worst of Browning's are " verses 
from the typographical point of view " we 
may realize to what an extent criticism gone 
mad is capable of ignoring poetic art and rest- 
ing its case upon poetic energy alone.

The reference to Arnold suggests reflections 
of a deeper sort. That the writer who was on 
the whole the truest and finest English critic of 
our generation occasionally went wrong, is well 
enough understood ; and it is generally admit- 
ted that his dicta about Shelley constitute the 
most wrong-headed of all his utterances. Now 
the substance of his criticism was that Shelley's 
poetry is "beautiful but ineffectual" the 
passage is too familiar to need quotation in full 
and the implication clearly is that it is more 
important for poetry to be effectual charged 
with energy, that is than beautiful. This is 
mainly interesting as going to show how a critic 
of the best type may be deluded by a formula, 
since this condemnation of poetry for being 
ineffectual is merely an application of the 
" criticism of life " formula which gave a doc- 
trinaire tinge to so much of Arnold's writing. 
"We do not for a moment admit that Shelley's 
poetry is ineffectual we have known too many 
young and generous souls to be moved by it as 
by a trumpet call but we understand that its 
energy is so bound up with the loveliness of its 
art that the critic who is looking chiefly for the 
bearings of poetry upon conduct might easily 
be led as Arnold was to underestimate the 
energy in the presence of so dazzling an art. 
All of which goes simply to show that the critic 
who is bent upon finding the effectual in poetry 
may miss it for the very reason of an unworthy 
distrust in the beautiful. " Beauty is truth," 
but this does not mean that the truth need stick 
out at all sorts of angles from the beautiful 
structure. 

On the whole, while there are some signs that 
energy gets more attention than art from critics 
nowadays, and while popular judgments are 
based, as was always the case, upon little save 
energy in poetry, we are inclined to say that 
the only criticism that counts seriously does 
not notably disregard the claims of art. There 
are still men like Mr. Watts-Dunton and Mr. 
Stedman and M. Brunetiere to expound poetry 
to an incredulous public, and we do not recall 
that earlier periods have been much better 
served. And the same incredulous public re- 
mains, as it always did remain, mostly imper- 
vious to the doctrine of the critic, and con- 
tinues to worship its false gods occasionally 
blundering into worship of a true one com- 
fortably thinks that it is enjoying poetry when 
it is only dazzled by rhetorical fireworks or 
dazed by sledge-hammer blows upon the brain, 
and gets a great deal of Philistine satisfaction 
out of life generally, and regards critics as daft 



persons of most unaccountable tastes. And 
the beautiful remains the beautiful in all ages, 
its laws immutable and its strength sure, while 
some there be who find it out, and, not content 
to know it for their own enjoyment alone, bid 
others to the feast and help them to understand 
how, although poetic energy by itself may ac- 
complish much, conjoined with poetic art it 
may accomplish more, and that the abiding 
power of literature resides in its form more 
than in its force, or rather that the form alone 
can preserve the force from becoming spent in 
the hour of its birth. 



THE MODERN-LANGUAGE MEN 
IN COUNCIL. 

There was a time when the Modern-Language 
teachers and students of the United States found in 
the meetings of the Philological Society a sufficient 
opportunity for the presentation of papers and the 
discussion of questions in their field. Some fifteen 
years ago it seemed advisable to found a separate 
Association ; and three years ago a Central Division 
of the latter was established in the Middle West. 
On both occasions the parent society was somewhat 
critical of the advisability of the newer organization ; 
but in each case it was ultimately recognized that 
real needs had been met. It is very significant that 
it was the modern languages that first found the 
bounds of the general society too confining, and 
still more so that this society now maintains two 
successful meetings. Nor must it be supposed that 
numbers alone are involved in this matter. When 
it comes to scientific training and natural ability, 
the moderns have every reason to welcome a com- 
parison. This is all natural enough, and would 
cause no comment were it not for the fact that it is 
but a short time ago that the prophecy of such a 
state of things was generally ridiculed in scholarly 
quarters. The times were ripe for the development 
of modern-language study ; capable men were at 
hand ; and the public gladly, the schools less readily, 
granted recognition to the new scholarship. 

The relations between the national society and 
the Central Division are now very agreeable. The 
good sense of the great majority of those in attend- 
ance at the recent Western meeting prevented even 
the recognition of the grumblings of the one or two 
who still fail to see that the Central Division is not 
a separate society, but simply affords the Western 
members of the national association a more con- 
venient place of gathering. The dates of the ses- 
sions were so arranged that it was possible for 
members to attend both meetings, and one or two 
did so. The Eastern meeting was held in Phila- 
delphia, at the University of Pennsylvania; the 
Western meeting convened at Northwestern Univer- 
sity in Evanston. Of the twenty-four papers read

[Jan. 16, 



at Philadelphia, nineteen were by men from States 
bordering on the Atlantic, five by men representing 
Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and California. In 
addition to these five papers, all the fifteen papers 
read at Evanston were by Western men. Ann 
Arbor still forms the boundary between the East 
and the West, being represented at both meetings 
and in both cases by English papers. The attend- 
ance at the Western meeting was larger than usual, 
and more representative of the best the West has. 
At the Eastern meeting there was a noticeable in- 
crease in the number of rising young men. 

The papers read at the two meetings indicate, to 
some extent, the comparative activity in the differ- 
ent fields of work, though the hand of the Secretary 
is quite properly exerted to regulate this to some 
extent and thus make the meetings equally attractive 
to men representing the various languages. There 
is usually a dearth of Romance papers ; this year 
there was a great change in this matter at the 
Eastern meeting, there being nine English, eight 
Romance, and five Germanic papers. At Evanston 
there were six English, six Germanic, and but two 
Romance papers, though the Secretary made espe- 
cial efforts to have the Romance department better 
represented. An unusual paper at the East was 
one on recent work in Celtic (which was, however, 
scarcely more than a bibliography) ; while at the 
Western meeting there were three papers dealing 
with Scandinavian subjects : one on the Scandina- 
vian element in English, by Professor Egge ; one 
by Professor Dodge, on the gender of English words 
in the Danish spoken in this country ; and one on 
the literary language or languages of Norway, by 
Professor Bothne. These papers, for the most part, 
represent the activity of men of Scandinavian de- 
scent living in the Northwest, and show how local 
meetings tend to bring out the less general phases 
of linguistic study. 

More than half of the papers at both meetings 
dealt with literary, and most of the remainder with 
philological, subjects. At the Eastern meeting, 
Professor Hunt of Princeton read a semi-pedagog- 
ical paper extolling the new requirements in " En- 
trance English "; the paper was censured for its 
indulgence in generalities. A pedagogical paper, 
read by Professor Clark at the Evanston meeting, 
on " Methods of Studying English Masterpieces," 
was criticised because it advocated the study of 
English masterpieces, not as literature, but as illus- 
trations of rules in formal rhetoric, and as a means 
of increasing the student's vocabulary, which latter 
point the writer seemed to regard as one of the 
chief aims of such study. Of the literary papers 
presented at Philadelphia, several dealt with prob- 
lems in comparative literature, and one, by Professor 
Brander Matthews, with a problem of general liter- 
ature. The writer called attention to the fact that 
we have gone too far in regarding the drama as 
only a phase of literature. The conditions under 
which the real drama can succeed are quite different 
from those under which most literature is best ap- 



preciated, and these conditions cannot be ignored in 
writing drama, and must be borne in mind in criti- 
cising a drama as a piece of literature. The address 
of the President, on " The Province of English 
Philology," was also of a somewhat general nature 
in that it made an appeal for the maintenance, or 
rather the establishment, of the broader and higher 
signification of the word " philology." It is to be 
doubted whether this meaning will ever really attach 
itself to the word, unless the higher conception is 
actually realized in a large number of our institu- 
tions, and in that case it would come about without 
personal resolves or the resolutions of learned socie- 
ties. Another paper that aroused general interest 
was that of Professor Fulton, of Wells College, 
" On Translating Anglo-Saxon Poetry "; for the 
discussion soon passed to the subject of the trans- 
lating of any kind of poetry. Professor Fulton 
advocated a metre that should conform as nearly 
as might be to that of the original, and in this was 
supported by Professor Bright and others. Professor 
Schelling advocated greater freedom, and Professor 
Cook even contended for the use of prose in order 
to secure a faithful rendering of the thought, though 
at the total sacrifice of the form. In an interesting 
paper entitled " Verbal Taboos, their Nature and 
Origin," Professor Scott, of Michigan, explained, 
from the point of view of the psychologist, how it 
comes about that some of the natural developments 
of language fall under the ban of the makers of 
rhetorics and grammars. There can be no doubt 
that, as Professor Scott said, these taboos of various 
forms of speech are often based on personal likes 
and dislikes of the authors of such books ; but it 
must be conceded that these personal likes and dis- 
likes are generally due to the belief that certain 
forms accord with real or assumed laws of language. 
What is needed is that scholars possessing a higher 
and truer knowledge of the life and growth of lan- 
guage be willing to write elementary books on the 
subject. In the meantime, such papers as Professor 
Scott's will do much to bring into ridicule the pro- 
nunciamentos of ignorant pedants who have assumed 
dictatorship in the matter of speech usage. 

In a paper of unusual breadth of view, Professor 
Schelling undertook to reconstruct the history of the 
Classical School with Ben Jonson as the corner- 
stone. He reviewed the well-known character of 
Jonson's work and influence, and made clear the 
direct and important relation existing between these 
and the essential characteristics of the Classical 
School. At the meeting at Evanston Professor 
Hempl, in accordance with the principles laid down 
in the paper read by him at New Haven two years 
ago, made clear the relation existing between the 
" Palamon and Arcite " and the " Knight's Tale," 
and showed that about two-thirds of the latter is 
essentially as it was in the earlier poem. Professor 
Jack, of Lake Forest, presented a careful study of 
those passages in " Piers the Plowman " that have 
been regarded, especially by Mr. Skeat, as reflecting 
facts in the life of the author, and showed that it

is exceedingly unlikely that these passages furnish 
any but the most insignificant biographical data. 

Professor Goebel, of Stanford, sent to the Western 
convention a paper on Heine's relation to Wolfgang 
Menzel, in which, with considerable intensity of 
feeling, he undertook to show that Heine had plun- 
dered Menzel and then reviled him. The assertions 
and arguments of the paper were severely handled 
by Professor Hatfield, of Northwestern, in a brief 
but pointed criticism. Professor Hatfield himself 
read a paper on the earliest poems of Wilhelm 
Miiller, and invited the convention to examine a 
collection of 2500 volumes of early and rare edi- 
tions of modern German writers, which the library 
of Northwestern has just acquired through the 
efforts of Professor Kohn. Professor Voss, of Wis- 
consin, called attention to the need of a more thor- 
ough study of the prose writings of Thomas Murner, 
which has hitherto been much retarded by the lack 
of suitable reprints. Of the papers touching on 
German literature that were read at Philadelphia, 
that of Professor Wood, of Baltimore, on the proto- 
type of Leonore. attracted especial attention and 
aroused the acute criticism of Professor Thomas of 
Columbia. 

The election of officers resulted in the selection of 
Professor Fortier, of Tulane University, as presi- 
dent of the national society ; and of Professor C. A. 
Smith, also of Louisiana, as president of the Central 
Division. The next meeting of the national society 
will be at the University of Virginia; the place of 
meeting of the Central Division has not yet been 
determined upon. 



ON A RECENT BOOK OF POEMS. 

(To K C. 8.) 

Once again the olden 

Joyance blossoms fair; 
Once again the golden 

Accents thrill the air; 
Once again we listen 

To the mellow strain, 
Gaze where song- waves glisten 

On that music's main. 

Clear as erst the message, 

Voice as nobly true, 
Sweet the wondrous presage 

Of the dreams we knew, 
Dreams that with the magic 

Of that singing rise, 
Sweeping every tragic 

Cloud from off our skies. 

Realms that light has builded 

Song has ever known, 
Seas that joy has gilded 

Verse has ever shown, 
And the gentler Muses 

Here again have sent 
What no heart refuses 

Of hope's blandishment.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

DIALECT, OR ENGLISH? 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

May I ask the opinion of yonr critical readers on a 
question of English ? The growth and popularity of the 
dialect story has caused words unknown to polite litera- 
ture to appear in conservative periodicals. That seems 
to be accepted as necessary. But how far can we per- 
mit this to go ? Can we afford to admit these tramps 
in the world of words into the society of their betters 
on terms of equality ? Can dialect and colloquial terms 
take the place of words which are acknowledged as 
standards in literature apart from the dialect story ? 

In an article in a recent number of " Scribner's Maga- 
zine " I find the word " tote "in the following sentence: 
" The sellers of the unsubstantial cakes called barquillos, 
1 little boats,' tote around their roulette machines which 
resemble fire-extinguishers." 

What is the reader to understand from the sentence ? 
Is it supposed to be humorous ? or does the author, Mr. 
Bishop, so far forget his Connecticut birth and Yale 
training that he prefers a colloquial term to an orthodox 
English word ? 

The "Century," "International," and "Standard" 
dictionaries give " tote " as a word of unknown origin, a 
colloquial Southern United States word, in use especi- 
ally among negroes. The " Century " adds that it is 
" in humorous use in the North and West." In an article 
on the Southern States, the occurrence of the local word 
might be justified by a desire for what is known as local 
color. But what justification can there be for using it 
in a description of a Spanish town ? 

Pursuing " tote " a little further, we find two instances 
of the use of the word cited in the " Century " diction- 
ary. One is in " Science," Vol. XL, p. 242, in a query 
concerning human beings as pack-animals : " The first 
pack-animals were men and women . . . They toted 
(carried on the head) . . ." In this instance, " tote " 
has a definite meaning peculiarly its own, which the user 
feels bound, however, to explain. The other citation is 
the " Century Magazine," Vol. XI., p. 224, the passage 
being from a story by Miss Alice French (Octave 
Thanet); the scene is an Arkansas town, and the man 
in whose conversation the word occurs is an illiterate 
native, using the word in his own way. The two instances 
illustrate the legitimate use of the word, and leave Mr. 
Bishop to explain why he finds it needful to use it in writ- 
ing of life in a place so remote from the home of the 
colloquialism which it certainly is.

ANOTHER DISPUTED AMERICANISM. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In a notice of a report made by Hamilton in 1791, 
an English reviewer wrote as follows : 

" We shall, at all times, with pleasure, receive from our 
transatlantic brethren real improvements of our common 
mother-tongue : but we shall hardly be induced to admit such 
phrases as that at page 93 'more lengthy,' for longer, or 
more diffuse. But, perhaps, it is an established American- 
ism." " British Critic," Nov., 1793, Vol. II., p. 286. 
Seldom has the danger of prophesying without knowl- 
edge been better illustrated than in this passage ; for 
while, doubtless, during the early part of this century 
British writers looked askance at the word and fre- 
quently qualified its use by the phrase " as the Americans

[Jan. 16, 



say," yet soon the epithet found favor. In 1818 Lord 
Harrowby, as we learn from R. Rush, " spoke of words 
that had obtained a sanction in the United States, in 
the condemnation of which he did not join; for example, 
lengthy, which imported what was tedious as well as 
long, an idea that no other English word seemed to 
convey as well." (" Residence at the Court of London," 
1833, p. 267.) In 1839, the late Asa Gray, after lis- 
tening to a debate in the House of Lords, wrote that 
" the word lengthy,' which was not long since called 
an Americanism, seems to be pretty well naturalized, 
as Brougham used it several times, and Scarlett more 
than once." (" Letters," 1893, p. 143.) In 1852 Mr. 
S. Bailey said that "in compliment to our brethren 
across the Atlantic " he would " mention an adjective 

. . . which is worthy, I think, of being accepted at 
their hands, I mean lengthy." (" Discourses on Various 
Subjects," p. 76.) And in 1867 a writer in Black- 
wood's Magazine," unmindful of the rash prophecy of 
the earlier reviewer, did not hesitate to assert that 
" ' lengthy,' whether of American or English origin, 
will probably remain English while the language lasts." 
(Vol. OIL, p. 411.) 

The first dictionary to recognize the word was Web- 
ster's Compendious Dictionary of 1806 ; while the earli- 
est English dictionaries to admit the word to their 
pages seems to have been those of Knowles (1835), 
Smart (1836), and Richardson (1838). In a review 
of Webster's Dictionary which appeared in 1809, the 
writer thus freed his mind: 
" This is the worst of the whole catalogue of Americanisms. 

... If of so low a word it were necessary to show the pre- 
cise meaning, we might say Mr. Webster has mistaken it, for 
the vulgar usually employ it to mean long even to tediousness, 
as his discourse was very lengthy." (" Monthly Anthology 
and Boston Review," VII. 264.) 

The implication that only " genteel " words require 
accurate definition is sufficiently amusing; but how 
astonished would be the British reviewer and the Bos- 
ton purist could they know that an epithet " which we 
shall hardly be induced to admit " has had in the present 
century the sanction of such " vulgar " English men 
and women as Dr. Arnold, Byron, Coleridge, W. L. 
Courtney, Dr. Dibdin, Dickens, George Eliot, J. Foster, 
E. A. Freeman, W. C. Hazlitt, Bishop Jebb, Professor 
Latham, R. LeGallienne, C. Lever, E. O'Donovan, 
Professor Powell, T. W. Reid, G. Saintsbury, Scott, 
Southey, J. A. Symonds, Miss M. Symonds, R. C. 
Trench, and Miss Yonge. 

So far, then, as the reputableness of the word is con- 
cerned, the controversy may be said long ago to have 
ended; but it is otherwise with regard to the question 
of its origin. For more than a century the belief has 
been held, on both sides of the Atlantic, by those who 
are competent to express an opinion as well as by casual 
users of the word, that it was first employed in this 
country. If, however, we turn to the Century Dictionary, 
we there read under lengthy : " Said by Richardson to 
have originated in the United States . . . but the earli- 
est quotations are from British authors." A single be- 
lated example from Southey is all that is given in sup- 
port of this statement. The only instance known to the 
present writer of the use of the word by a British author 
before this century, occurs in a letter written by Thomas 
Paine in 1796. ( Writings," 1895, III. 251.) That, 
however, as the English reviewer surmised, the term 
was well established in this country in the eighteenth 
century is shown by the following citations; and the 



burden of proof lies on those who maintain that the 
word was not first used on this side of the water. 

"But I grow too minute and lengthy." 1759, J. Adams, 
"Diary," "Works" (1850), II. 59. 

" A committee was appointed to draw up reasons against 
issuing said charter, to be laid before his Excellency ; which 
has been done ; those reasons, which are pretty lengthy, hav- 
ing been drawn up by your humble servant, instead of some 
more capable person." 1762, J. Mayhew, in B. Peirce's 
"History of Harvard University" (1833), 278. 

" I ought to tell you that the Debate upon the American 
Stamp- Bill came on before the House [of Commons] for the 
first time, last Wednesday, when the same was opened by 
Mr. Grenville, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a pretty 
lengthy speech." 1765, J. Ingersoll, " Letters relating to the 
Stamp- Act" (1766), 14. 

"Dangerous consequences, they apprehend, would attend 
being nearer to them [Indians], arising from their being bur- 
densome and expensive to ye School by their frequent and 
lengthy visits." 1768, N. Cleaveland, in F. Chase's " History 
Dartmouth College" (1891), 1. 107. 

" We have received sundry Pieces, some of which came so 
late, and others so lengthy, that we are obliged to postpone 
them." 1769, March 6, "Boston Gazette." 

" The great defect here [England] is, in all sorts of people, 
a want of attention to what passes in such remote countries as 
America ; an unwillingness to read anything about them if it 
appears a little lengthy." 1773, B. Franklin, "Works" 
(1887), V. 190. 

" You make no mention of the whole sheets I have wrote to 
you, by which I judge you either never received them, or that 
they were so lengthy as to be troublesome." 1776, Abigail 
Adams, in "Familiar Letters of J. Adams and his Wife" 
(1876), 161. 

"Journals of observations on the quantities of rain, and de- 
gree of heat, being lengthy, and confused, and too minute to 
produce general and distinct ideas, I have taken five years' 
observations." 1782, T. Jefferson, "Writings" (1894), III. 
177. 

"This is my fourth letter to you since I arrived in this 
State ; and some of them are so lengthy that I presume you 
must return before you can find leisure to read, much more to 
answer them." 1785, E. Gerry, in R. King's " Life and Cor- 
respondence" (1894), I. 74. 

" Many of the buildings are brick and stone ; but the atten- 
tion of travelers is principally engaged by a very lengthy brick 
building, just above the town, two stories high, and in a most 
delightful situation." 1787, M. Cutler, in "Life, Journals, 
and Correspondence" (1888), I. 244. 

In a work already quoted, Mr. S. Bailey declared 
that the word " is a modern instance of what forms a 
fascinating feature in the study of Etymology, namely, 
the power of words to indicate the habits and customs 
of those who used them," and asserted that " it could 
have sprung up nowhere but in a country addicted to 
protracted oratory." (" Discourses," p. 76.) On this 
passage Dr. Fitzedward Hall remarks that " as the 
word originated, so far as is known, in the days of 
Washington, who uses it, one may still justly object to 
Mr. Bailey's associating it with American grandilo- 
quence, a feature of the present century ; " and asks 
whether " it can be proved that the epithet was ever 
applied more freely to spoken discourse than to written ? " 
(" Modern English," 1873, p. 56.) The answer to this 
question furnished by the eighty or more examples be- 
fore me is that the adjective is used over twenty times 
in qualification of various nouns, and that it is applied 
over fifty times to written discourse but only five times 
to spoken discourse. Mr. Bailey, then, however sound 
his main contention may be, was certainly unfortunate 
in his choice of an illustration.

THE NAVY AND THE NAVAL POLICY 
OF THE UNITED STATES.* 

Mr. John R. Spears's " History of Our Navy" 
is a popularly written work devoted mainly to 
descriptions of naval actions and warlike opera- 
tions afloat generally, participated in by our 
ships and sailors, from the " Gaspe " affair in 
1772 down to recent times. Dwelling thus 
chiefly on the more romantic and picturesque 
side of his theme, the author has treated briefly 
and incidentally the drier and more technical 
topics of naval administration and development. 
What he says in the latter regard, however, is 
instructive and to the point, and seems to de- 
note a closer knowledge on his part of marine 
matters than is to be gained from histories and 
manuals alone. We are not prepared to assert 
that Mr. Spears has actually been in the ser- 
vice, but his book has, to our thinking, an un- 
mistakable professional ring. Sea terms and 
scraps of nautical vernacular drop from his pen 
as easily and aptly as from Mr. Clark Russell's, 
and he describes a sea fight with a zest and 
verve and a grasp of marine technicalities hardly 
to be looked for in the work of a landsman. 
His account of the famous actions of the War 
of 1812 is notably good though here the 
English reader, used to the consolatory versions 
of his own historians, may perhaps detect a note 
of undue exultation in Mr. Spears's effusively 
patriotic pages. 

In his opening volume Mr. Spears touches 
briefly on the origin of the American Navy, 
and then passes on to the narration of the naval 
actions of the Revolutionary War and the first 
war with the Barbary pirates. The story of the 
War of 1812 occupies the whole of Volume II. 
and about half of Volume III.; and the latter 
volume contains also accounts of the second 
war with the Algerines, of the naval operations 
of the Mexican War, and of Perry's Japan 
Expedition. There are special chapters on the 
British press-gang system, British prisons, 
naval duels, the West India pirates, etc. 

The fourth and concluding volume is devoted 
to the Civil War, and closes with a suggestive 
chapter on our new navy and the naval policy 
which in the author's opinion this country ought 
to pursue. Mr. Spears's views in this regard 
seem sounder than those generally advanced

by advocates of naval expansion one of 
whom he is, though in a comparatively moderate 
way. The gist of Mr. Spears's contention 
seems to be that the important thing for us is 
not so much the immediate possession of a 
great array of battleships and big guns as the 
maintenance at all times of an ability to con- 
struct them when needed. The conditions 
which force European nations into the costly 
race for naval supremacy do not obtain in our 
case. We have no chronic quarrels on hand, 
no "imperial policy" of foreign aggression and 
annexation, no outlying and vulnerable posses- 
sions to defend.* We need not aspire to rate 
first, or even third, among naval powers in 
point of numbers. But in point of ability to 
construct we should aim at all times to be 
abreast of the first. We must not allow our 
plants to decay, our tools to rust, our artisans 
and inventors to stagnate. We must " keep 
our hand in "; and to this end a relatively 
moderate degree of continuous activity in ship- 
building and gun-making, positive and experi- 
mental, will suffice. Mr. Spears thinks we 
ought to lay down at least one new ship of the 
first class yearly. This course would serve not 
only to maintain and foster the ability in ques- 
tion, but also to keep afloat under our flag such 
a navy as sense and experience point to as the 
ideal one for us that is to say, a navy rela- 
tively modest in numbers, but unsurpassed in 
efficiency. As for our former cheese-paring 
policy of " letting other nations do the experi- 
menting for us," events have shown us the 
futility of that. We " saved the dollars," it 
is true; and we had the fleeting satisfaction 
of chuckling over what we thought our " cute- 
ness " in getting our experience gratis. But 
they laugh best who laugh last. We speedily 
found, when we concluded some ten or twelve 
years ago to put our cheaply gained " experi- 
ence " to the test, that it was practically next 
to no experience at all ; that what we had saved 
in dollars we had lost in capacity ; that we 
could no more, of our own knowledge and re- 
sources, build a first-class battleship than China 
could ; and that if we needed one on compara- 
tively short notice we should be reduced to 
buying it of the nations that had been " doing 
our experimenting for us." That was humiliat- 
ing. More than that, it was alarming, since it 
disclosed our defenceless condition, and nobody 
in his senses contends that we are so absolutely 
exempt from the danger of foreign war as to 

The acquisition by this country of Cuba or Hawaii would 
of course necessitate some revisal of our author's conclusions.

need no degree of " preparedness " for it what- 
ever. Not even Jefferson went so far as that ; 
for he advocated, as we know, a defensive navy 
to consist of a sort of amphibious gun-boat that 
could be stored on land in times of peace, and 
rolled down on the beach for launching in case 
of invasion. So, when we discovered the folly 
of expecting to absorb, without cost or effort, 
the hard- won skill and capacity of other nations, 
we set about mending matters with an energy 
and judgment of which we are now beginning 
to reap the reward. Fortunately, we slipped 
through the ticklish period of our apprentice- 
ship in modern naval construction without seri- 
ous foreign entanglements ; else we must have 
had to pay for our former penny- wise methods in 
the solid coin of national shame and disaster. 
For years, with an elastic and vaguely conceived 
Monroe Doctrine, a minatory press, and a blus- 
tering coterie of Congressional Bobadils on our 
hands, the condition of our navy was such that 
had we gone to war with even a minor power 
like Chili which at one time showed some- 
thing like a desire to "get at us" we should 
probably have met at the outset a series of 
mortifying defeats. Time, enabling us to 
bring our vast general resources to bear, must 
have reversed matters ; but in the meantime 
we should have drunk of the cup of national 
humiliation deep enough, perhaps, to satisfy 
even our British post-prandial friends and well- 
wishers, and enable them to return in kind our 
compliments on their exploits against petty foes 
at Majuba Hill and elsewhere. 

Turning to current events, can anyone doubt 
that the greatly improved condition of our navy 
to-day is a factor making mainly for peace in 
our present entanglement in Spanish-Cuban 
quarrels, or that if our navy were twice or thrice 
as strong as it is our position at Madrid would 
be twice or thrice as strong also ? It needs but 
a slight acquaintance with Spanish opinion as 
mirrored in the usual organs of expression to 
see that the first consideration that presents 
itself to the Spanish mind when weighing the 
alternative of "Peace or War?" with this 
country is not a moral or even an economical 
one, but the purely practical one as to the 
chance of success the Spanish navy would have 
in a conflict with ours. The Spaniard is con- 
vinced that we are totally and flagrantly wrong 
on this Cuban question ; he is convinced of his 
patriotic duty to resent what he deems our 
insolent intermeddling in his private affairs ; 
and it is by no means unreasonable to assert 
that were our navy to-day what it was ten or 



twelve years ago we should have a war on our 
hands within six months. As it is, our diplo- 
matic efforts to abate the Cuban nuisance are 
already bearing good fruit, and will doubtless be 
crowned with ultimate success. Complications 
such as this with Spain may arise at any time, 
and from unforeseen quarters. The policy to 
which we stand committed, of opposing vi et 
armis on this continent such political enter- 
prises on the part of European nations as that 
of Louis Napoleon in Mexico, or as are now 
(thanks to the prevalent craze for " Imperial- 
ism " and schemes of " colonial expansion " of 
the Jamesonian order) on foot in China, and 
indeed almost everywhere else where the local 
power is notoriously weak and unsupported, is 
in itself, one would think, enough to warrant 
us in keeping afloat such a navy as Mr. Spears 
holds to be commensurate with our needs and 
our political pretensions. 

The building of our new navy virtually began 
with the formation by Secretary William H. 
Hunt of a board, headed by Rear- Admiral John 
Rogers, " to determine the requirements of a 
new navy." The board found that the United 
States ought to have twenty-one battleships of 
the first class, seventy unarmored cruisers, 
twenty torpedo boats, five torpedo gunboats, 
and five rams. The estimate was not extrava- 
gant, and it was largely approved by the nation. 
Then we started, or tried to start, to build our 
ships. We had a beautiful theoretical knowl- 
edge of how everything was to be done, and the 
time had come to show a rather skeptical world 
how extremely sharp we had been in getting 
all this knowledge without expending a dollar 
or handling a tool. But somehow or other, 
when we turned to our ship-yards and foundries 
things did not work as smoothly as our politi- 
cians and naval doctrinaires had led us to ex- 
pect. There was an ominous hitch at the start. 
We found that we could not build even one of 
the armored ships. We could not roll even the 
thinnest of armor-plates, nor make a gun that 
would pierce even the cheap plating of the 
ramshackle old monitors we had lying up in 
ordinary. In short, we had to begin our edu- 
cation in modern naval construction almost de 
novo ; and so, instead of building battleships 
off-hand as we had expected to do, we started 
in tentatively on third-rate cruisers. Of course 
we had to buy our first armor-plates abroad, 
and we even went abroad for the plans of one 
of our cruisers the " Charleston." Had war 
been impending we should have had to buy our 
ships outright and fully equipped wherever

THE DIAL, 



they could be found. But, as Mr. Spears ob- 
serves, we were building a navy in time of 
peace ; and a ship that " could not get out of 
her own way," if built by our own mechanics 
and designers, was then more to our purpose 
than the best one afloat would have been if 
purchased abroad. The important thing for 
us at the start was not so much the product as 
the training, the building of men rather than 
the building of ships. The product, however, 
of our earliest efforts was very creditable to us. 
Our first cruisers were the " Chicago," the 
"Atlanta," and the "Boston "; and these ships, 
while by no means "the best of their class 
afloat," as our enthusiastic reporters and poli- 
ticians of course declared them to be, were 
remarkably good ships, considering the circum- 
stances under which they were built. Says 
Mr. Spears : 

" As the product of apprentices in the art of building 
modern warships, they are marvels of excellence. But 
since they were designed we have learned something." 

Since they were designed we have indeed learned 
a great deal. We have, for instance, learned 
to design and build a ship like the "New York," 
of which Mr. Spears says : 

" She cost ' a whole lot of money,' it is true, but as 
we recall the thrill that stirred the nation when the 
story of her trial trip was told when it was told that 
we had built the swiftest and most powerful cruiser in 
the world, we are bound to say that twice the sum in- 
vested in any other way by the government could not 
have given the nation so great a benefit. It was not 
that anyone was incited to a point where he wished the 
nation to go to war. . . . With the New York ' afloat, 
the American patriot was so far assured that his country 
would not be bullied, and so we should have peace." 

Swift cruisers like the twenty-two knot " Co- 
lumbia " and the still swifter " Minneapolis," 
and a shoal of little cruisers and gunboats for 
shallow waters, followed the " New York." In 
the meanwhile we were at work on real battle- 
ships, beginning with the " Maine " and ending 
with the " Iowa," the " Indiana," the " Kear- 
sarge," and the " Illinois." Mr. Wilson, the 
English author of " Ironclads in Action," draws 
an instructive comparison between our " Iowa " 
and the British " Majestic," and concedes that 
the American ship, though considerably smaller 
than the British one, is fully a match for her. 
Says our author : 

" Let no mistake be made about this. It is a matter 
of the greatest moment when our ship of 11,500 tons is 
conceded to be a match for one of 15,000 tons in the 
best navy in the world not because we have the ship, 
but because we have developed the men who can do 
that kind of work and the tools for their use." 

While we were developing shipbuilders we 



were also developing gnnmakers. As we have 
said, we could not ten years ago make a gun 
that would pierce the armor of one of the old 
" Monitors." The " Monitor " turret was com- 
posed of eight layers of one-inch iron plates, 
laid so as to break joints, and our best gun of 
that day, a seven-inch Brooke, firing a solid 
shot weighing 150 pounds, was unable to do 
any material damage to it. Nowadays we make 
guns throwing projectiles that would pierce the 
turret of a " Monitor " as a rifle- bullet would 
pierce a bandbox. The fact that our mod- 
ern cannon throw projectiles weighing 1,100 
pounds, which strike with a force sufficient to 
lift a thousand tons twenty-five feet, tells the 
story of the development of the gun. The 
modern eight-inch rifle throws a steel bolt 
weighing 250 pounds, at a muzzle velocity of 
2,500 feet per second, with a striking power of 
10,830 fooUons. The fact that the old eight- 
inch iron shot could not penetrate four inches 
of iron plates, while the modern steel bolt pene- 
trates twenty-six inches of wrought iron, is sug- 
gestive. The best thirteen-inch modern rifles 
have a striking power of about 35,000 foot-tons, 
and penetrate thirty-four inches of wrought 
iron. 

Thus, after an apprenticeship of ten years 
the gunmakers and shipbuilders of the United 
States have done enough, as Mr. Spears thinks, 
to entirely satisfy their countrymen. We can 
now build and equip our own ships. Among 
the navies of the world ours ranks, at best, 
fifth, hardly as high as it should rank even 
now, perhaps, and certainly far lower than it 
should rank were the government to embark on 
that " forward policy " of which the annexation 
of Hawaii would be the first step. Whether 
or no that step will be taken is doubtful ; and 
there now seems to be a growing tendency to 
adopt Speaker Reed's sober dictum, " Empire 
can wait," as a watchword. We all know the 
magic influence on opinion of catching phrases 
currently repeated ; and it is not unlikely that 
this one of Speaker Reed's will go far to turn 
the scale in settling the impending Hawaiian 
question. Mr. Spears's "History of Our Navy " 
is, all things considered, the best that has yet 
been produced, and it is profusely and appro- 
priately illustrated. E. G. J.

CHURCH HISTORIAN, THEOLOGIAN, AND 
TEACHER.* 

" I am a Swiss by birth, a German by edu- 
cation, an American by choice." Such was Dr. 
Philip Schaff's description of himself nationally. 
Had he said, " I am a Christian," he would have 
expressed his real relationship theologically. 
True, he was connected with a denomination ; 
but he was claimed by the whole Christian 
church. As his life was given in service for 
the whole church, so an account of that life is 
of interest in every branch of the church. 

His son, as his biographer, realizes the deli- 
cacy and difficulties of his position. " A son 
is prompted by natural disposition to mistake 
matters of a purely private interest for matters 
of public concern, and to dwell upon what is 
usual and common as though it were exceptional 
and distinctive." But he has selected his mate- 
rials most wisely, and has proved his fitness for 
his task by showing a fair discernment of his 
father's abilities, and by a marked modesty in 
reference to matters in which he personally was 
a participant. He tells us of his father's life, 
not of his own. 

In reading of Dr. Schaff's early days, we gain 
an insight into Continental methods of instruc- 
tion in both preparatory and university work. 
And as Dr. Schaff's long life was spent in the 
class-room, this view is extended even into our 
own times, and in this country as well as in 
Europe. More than this, the biographer, having 
access to memoranda preserved by Dr. S chaff, 
shows us much of his father's association with 
the leading theological and philosophical teach- 
ers of the last sixty years. And, still further, 
we gain Dr. Schaff's own intelligent estimate 
of these leaders of thought. Extracts from his 
journal are more valuable than encyclopaedic 
articles, as being less formal, and as being the 
written appreciation of one who knew them 
intimately. 

Dr. Schaff impressed all his acquaintances 
as an intensely spiritual man. With him knowl- 
edge never took the place of piety. His was a 
simple yet perfect trust on Jesus Christ. Much 
of his conversation had this as its topic. The 
first chapter of this biography tells of his con- 
version, and the influence in his early life of 
pastor and teachers. It was his most precious 
attainment. 

Much interest naturally centres about the

occasion of his coming to America, and the 
views held by German Christians as to the con- 
ditions and needs of this country. His coming 
was largely in the missionary spirit. His first 
twenty years of service were given in the semi- 
nary of the German Reformed church at Mer- 
cersburg, Pennsylvania. His inaugural address, 
at the age of twenty-five, on " The Principle of 
Protestantism," opened a new line of thought, 
and has been regarded as the most influential 
work of the denomination in this country. It 
led to a trial of its author upon charges of 
heresy, and, because of his acquittal, the with- 
drawal of leading men from denominational 
affiliation. But the Mercersburg theology, so- 
called, as developed out of this discussion, has 
exerted a helpful influence upon the statements 
of all the Reformed communions. 

The last twenty-three years of Dr. Schaff's 
life were devoted to teaching in Union Theo- 
logical Seminary. To this work he brought 
the abilities gained by long years of close 
study, by twenty years of teaching experience, 
and by thirty years of personal contact with 
the leading educators of the world. His long 
service in Union Seminary was particularly 
fruitful. His instruction was helpful and au- 
thoritative. His influence upon students was 
encouraging and uplifting. His service to the 
church was wide-reaching. His opportunities 
for research and authorship were unlimited. 

A look at Dr. Schaff's relations to his stu- 
dents may be pleasant. Many will remember, 
as does this writer, his custom of inviting us 
to walk with him, one on either side, for half 
an hour, seeking to become better acquainted 
with us, and to give such direction and encour- 
agement in our student work as was possible. 
These half-hours out of his busy life were 
among his best gifts, and awaken renewed 
gratitude when recalled to memory. His stu- 
dents also found employment in his study, at 
remunerative prices, in clerical work in con- 
nection with his publications. 

The study of Dr. Schaff's life really shows 
us the history of the great religious movements 
during the last half-century. During these 
years Protestant Christianity has become more 
compact. Its members have come closer to- 
gether. A heartier fellowship exists. Prob- 
ably no other agency has been so helpful in 
this respect as the Evangelical Alliance ; and 
at times it seemed hardly too much to say that 
Philip Schaff was the Evangelical Alliance. 
Here he could work as could no other, because 
of his extraordinary acquaintance in all parts 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

of the Christian world, and the eminent re- 
spect and affection felt for him by leaders in 
all denominations. And the reason was evi- 
dent. He did not seek or expect an organic 
union of churches. " He urged confederate 
union between allied Protestant communions." 
In the service of the Alliance, and looking 
toward such a union of sentiment and effort, 
he gladly gave his time, and made it the sub- 
ject of constant thought and prayer. He 
believed that American theology should be 
Christocentric. 

The Bible Revision idea early secured his 
attention. He saw the need, and he labored 
unceasingly and persistently for its accomplish- 
ment. To him was entrusted the responsibility 
of organizing the American companies of Re- 
visers. Through him the communications be- 
tween the English and American companies 
were continually held. And when, because of 
the terms imposed by the University Presses, 
to whom the English Revisers transferred the 
copyright, the original relations to the Ameri- 
can Revisers could not be maintained, and it 
seemed impossible to hold the American com- 
panies together, it was again Dr. Schaff who, 
by his intermediary relations, restored the har- 
mony, and enabled the project to succeed. 

Perhaps the one feature in his theological 
life most pleasant to him was his relation to 
German and American theologians. He called 
himself " a mediator between German and 
Anglo-American Theology and Christianity." 
Dr. Mann called him " the presiding genius of 
international theology." His breadth of view 
and catholicity of temperament led him to enter 
with enthusiasm into the project for a Parlia- 
ment of Religions, at Chicago, in 1893, and to 
take an active part in this world-famous gath- 
ering. He did not regard this Congress, as 
some seem to have done, as an exaltation of 
non - Christian religions, nor did he consider 
himself as sacrificing any Christian convictions 
by sharing in its discussions. He looked upon 
it as a step toward the reunion of Christen- 
dom, the thought to which he had given his 
whole life, and which formed the subject of 
his address read at the Parliament. Dr. Henry 
H. Jessup characterized this paper as " apos- 
tolic, one of the most Christ-like utterances in 
all church history." 

Dr. Schaff is known most widely by his 
writings. Men marvel at reading the list of 
original and edited works, both in English and 
in German. His " History of Christianity," 
his " History of the Creeds," and his " Person 



of Christ " will live, and long be recognized as 
leading works in their spheres. 

Thus we have tried to give an idea of the 
picture of this great life as portrayed in the 
stately volume before us. It is only a sugges- 
tion. The reader will not want to leave the 
book. It is well written. It presents a faithful 
picture. It is not overdrawn. It shows us 
the man. 

HARRY W. REED. 



MR. GRANT AL.I/EX AS AX ANTHRO- 
POLOGIST.* 



Everyone knows Mr. Grant Allen's style : 
it is always bright and attractive. Its charm 
is not absent in his first extensive work in 
anthropology, " The Evolution of the Idea of 
God." In this work he aims to get at the way 
in which our modern idea of God has originated 
and developed. He recognizes two conflict- 
ing schools of thought upon the matter, that of 
the humanists and that of animists, and says, 
" This work is to some extent an attempt to 
reconcile them." Having made this statement, 
he proceeds to draw up what is perhaps the 
most complete and forceful statement of the 
ghost-theory pure and simple that has been 
presented. The book shows an enormous 
amount of thought and ingenuity. While he 
does not appear to us to demonstrate the fal- 
lacy of animism, he certainly presents many 
points favoring the ghost-theory, which must be 
considered. 

Having thus indicated the author's position, 
we may briefly trace his outline of treatment. 
The origin of gods is in every case traced back 
to the dead man. " We see at once that no 
gods exist for them [i, e., simple savages] save 
the ancestral corpses or ghosts." The subject 
of the worship of stones and stakes is then 
taken up. The claim is made that the sacred 
stone is in its origin the gravestone : at first 
merely a bowlder rolled upon the grave to keep 
the dead man down ; later, a true gravestone, 
coming in time to be the 'representative of the 
man ; lastly, his carved representation. In 
similar wise it is claimed that the sacred stake 
was at first driven through the body to hold 
the dead man. It followed much the same line 
of development as the stone, and came in time 
to really represent the dead man in his divine 
form. Having traced the beginning of idols

stocks and stones to the worship of the 
dead, the author makes a special application of 
his theory to the Jews, and claims that Jahweh 
was a sacred gravestone, which was carried in 
the ark of the covenant and represented a long- 
deceased ancestor. In the light of his investi- 
gations to this point, the gods of Egypt and 
Israel are studied, and the rise of monotheism 
out of polytheism traced. At this place we find 
the author saying : 

" We have shown how polytheism came to be, and 
how from it a certain particular group of men the 
early Israelites rose by slow degrees through natural 
stages to the monotheistic conception. . . . How did 
this purely local and national Hebrew deity advance 
to the conquest of the civilized world ? . . . Why do 
most of the modern nations which have nominally 
adopted monotheism yet conceive of their god as com- 
pounded in some mystically incomprehensible fashion 
of three persons the Father, the Son, and the Holy 
Ghost ? " 

In elucidation of these questions, the matters 
of incarnation and the intentional manufacture 
of gods are discussed. Of such manufactured 
gods, the gods of cultivation, and especially the 
gods of corn and wine, are studied. Here the 
vast mass of materials gathered by Mannhandt 
and Tragen are drawn upon, though Mr. Grant 
Allen's point of view and mode of treatment 
are radically different from theirs. Resurrec- 
tion, sacrifice, the sacrament, atonement, are 
investigated in connection with such gods. 
Two principles are then enunciated " first, 
that a dying god, human or animal, is usually 
selected as a convenient vehicle for the sins of 
the people ; and second, that without shedding 
of blood there is no remission of sins." The 
reader can easily see that Mr. Allen is leading 
up to his climax. Christ is the god of a Syrian 
population ; a corn-and-wine god, whose death 
frees the world from sin and whose resurrection 
proves that man shall rise again. The sacra- 
ment of his flesh and blood, bread and wine, is 
paralleled by many similar sacraments to such 
gods elsewhere. 

We have thus fully presented Mr. Allen's 
treatment, because fairness appeared to demand 
it. It is at once thoughtful and ingenious ; it 
is presented as inoffensively as possible. It 
deserves careful study, not only from the an- 
thropologist of whatever school, but also from 
the religionist who pays no attention to anthro- 
pology proper. While the animist will not be 
convinced by the argument, he will certainly 
be given abundant matter for thought, pre- 
sented strikingly and fearlessly. 

FREDERICK STARR. 



PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION?* 

The interesting initial volume of the projected pub- 
lications of the Philosophical Union of the Univer- 
sity of California bears the title "The Conception of 
God." It is the product of a debate in the Univer- 
sity between Professors Royce, LeConte, Howison, 
and Meres. Professor Royce led off in the discus- 
sion, and his presentation was made the pivotal 
point of what followed. The later and larger por- 
tion of the volume is made up of a more complete 
statement and more careful defense of his positions. 
His view is that of Monism, rendered in the form 
of Idealism ; and the doubt it occasioned was 
whether any adequate room could be found in it 
for the transcendental personal character of God. 
The defense and the attack necessarily led to the 
question of freedom, the distinguishing point in 
personality, and the dividing point in forms of law. 
It is this question especially which Professor Royce 
treats in his final statement. 

One observes with interest the assertion of each 
of the contestants, that he finds as the fruit of the 
debate but little occasion to modify his own opinions. 
The grasshopper plunges through the ingenious web 
of the spider. It is of no moment ; there is thread 
enough in the spinneret to repair the damage. The 
same instinct that wove the first tissue will readily 
restore it. 

Is it simply the cohesion of a philosophical con- 
ception we seek after, or is it a faithful rendering 
of all Christian experiences ? Does philosophy 
follow after faith with a theory conformable to 
facts ; or does a theory predetermine the contents 
of faith, giving faith less or more room as the ruling 
idea expands or contracts upon it under the hand- 
ling of the mind ? There can hardly be a doubt as 
to which is the proper relation. Religious belief, 
religious activity, and religious sentiment constitute 
the controlling evolutionary facts which make up 
the spiritual world. It is the business of philosophy 
simply to take these facts at their true value, which 
is their empirical value, and give them adequate 
support and inner coherence. The subtlety of the 
ideas developed in this process, and their logical 
coherence, are of little moment compared with their 
conformity to the religious history of the world in its 
depth, power, and diversity. The effort of Professor 
Royce seems to be to broaden an idea, the inade- 
quacy of which the mind instinctively feels, so that 
it may, with some color of truth, embrace the facts

of a spiritual world, in itself so ample, unimpeach- 
able, and grandly significant. These experiences 
are crowded together and belittled, simply that a 
ruling conception may have some show of covering 
them. We much prefer the idealistic to the em- 
pirical rendering of the world ; but we can accept 
neither, because neither is adequate to its work. 
One can hardly touch the discussion involved in this 
book without being at once immersed in it. Pro- 
fessor Royce shows much ingenuity of thought, and 
clearness and grace of expression. The fatal defect 
in his theory is that it is a web floating in the air. 
To pursue it with the eye is to fall over the things 
nearest to us and be bruised upon them. It is fitted 
to give correction to the inadequate statements of 
realism, not to displace them. It is only an invigo- 
rating intellectual gymnastic to encounter idealism. 
The doctrine is far too-removed from the general 
mind the facts which that mind stands for 
to make any extended conquests. 

The criticism of Professor Royce on the thing-in- 
itself as an unknowable term, brought in to no pur- 
pose to expound phenomena, seems to us just. We 
do not think it holds, however, as against force and 
phenomena, regarded as one inseparable fact. 

" The Providential Order of the World " is the 
title of a volume containing a series of lectures 
given in the University of Glasgow, on the Gifford 
foundation. Lord Gifford, in endowing these lec- 
tures, assigned as the theme, A Knowledge of God, 
and directed that the lectures should be addressed 
to the general student and that they should keep 
pace with current thought. The well-trodden con- 
ventional paths of apologetics were thus closed to 
them. The subject chosen by Professor Bruce, and 
the discussion under it, were in harmony with this 
purpose. The salient points are man's place in the 
universe, the worth of man, the discipline of the 
world as developing character. No themes could be 
more vital and comprehensive. The author treats 
them with liberal resources of knowledge, and with 
a broad and generous spirit. We cannot, however, 
think his thoughts quite as incisive, nor his conclu- 
sions quite as masterful, as the topic demands. 
While he does not fall below the occasion, he does 
not signally rise to it. 

"Christian Aspects of Life " is a volume made up 
of occasional addresses by the Bishop of Durham, 
delivered in the ordinary routine of his work. They 
are united by a loose cohesion of topics, under a 
variety of headings, such as "The National Church," 
"Foreign Missions," "Education," "Social Service." 
They are hardly vivacious or fresh, but they are 
eminently sober and substantial. We are left in no 
doubt as to whether they are philosophical or relig- 
ious. They are profoundly religious ; yet taken out 
of the region of cant by an erudite and reflective 
temper. Bishop Westcott is one more in the long 
list of experienced, devout, and cultivated divines 
whom the Church of England has nourished in its 



communion. They have been men who have deeply 
felt the force of religions ideas as applied in a sober 
and extended form to the affairs of life. They have 
had a faith conformable to and strengthened by a 
varied, positive, and fruitful experience. Little as 
we may be inclined to accept the details of doctrine 
or ritual associated with this Church, we can hardly 
fail to see that there is a solid and undeniable ele- 
ment of fact and truth in this continuous develop- 
ment of human life under religious belief.

RECENT AMERICAN POETRY.* 

It is many years since it was last possible to in- 
clude a new volume by Mr. Stedman in any review 
of recent poetry. The student of literature does 
not altogether bemoan the lapsed period, for it at 
least enabled the poet to win another sort of dis- 
tinction by producing, in his three volumes of prose, 
the most substantial and serious body of literary 
criticism that has yet been written by any American. 
Meanwhile, although Lowell and Whittier and 
Holmes went to join the majority of poets dead and 
gone, we knew that one of their noblest fellow- 
singers was still with us, and were not infrequently 
reminded of the fact by an occasional contribution 
to some periodical publication. These scattered

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



contributions, and many others heretofore unpub- 
lished, have at last been brought together in a 
volume of " Poems Now First Collected," and our 
literature is made the richer by a book which not 
only exhibits no decline from the standard of the 
familiar " Household Edition " of Mr. Stedman's 
verse, but in some respects marks an advance in 
power of expression, a severer artistic restraint, a 
richer music, and a riper passion. Some of these 
pieces, indeed, are already familiar enough. " The 
Hand of Lincoln " long ago took its place among 
the best poems inspired by the great leader whose 
life and tragic fate also inspired the " Commemo- 
ration Ode " of Lowell and the immortal threnody 
of Whitman. The "Provencal Lovers," too, has 
long been a favorite illustration of the vein of 
mingled sentiment and fancy that has been so char- 
acteristic a feature of Mr. Stedman's work. Of 
such poems as these little remains to be said, and 
we note, rather, some of the less familiar pieces in 
the collection now published. Among these a high 
place must be given to the Christmas ballad or carol 
of " The Star-Bearer," which has an imaginative 
reach and splendor of diction to which the poet has 
not often attained. The first two stanzas may be 
quoted. 

" There were seven angels erst that spanned 

Heaven's roadway out through space, 
Lighting with stars, by God's command, 
The fringe of that high place 

Whence plumed beings in their joy, 

The servitors His thoughts employ, 
Fly ceaselessly. No goodlier band 
Looked upward to His face. 

"There, on bright hovering wings that tire 

Never, they rested mute, 
Nor of far journeys had desire, 

Nor of the deathless fruit ; 
For in and through each angel soul 
All waves of life and knowledge roll, 
Even as to nadir streamed the fire 
Of their torches resolute." 

A music simpler, but no less exquisite, is found in 
" A Sea-Change, at Kelp Rock," a reflective strain 
suggested by reading Sophocles one summer day. 
It is the music of Mrs. Browning's " Wine of Cy- 
prus," and is quite as haunting in its melancholy 
beauty. 

" Drops the book but from its prison 

Tell me now what antique spell, 
Through the unclaspt cover risen, 

Moves the waves I know so well ; 
Bids me find in them hereafter, 
Dimpled to their utmost zone 
With the old innumerous laughter, 
An ^Egean of my own ? 

" Even so : the blue .iEgean 

Through our tendriled arches smiles, 
And the distant empyrean 

Curves to kiss enchanted isles : 
Isles of Shoals, I know yet fancy 

This one day shall have free range, 
And yon isles her necromancy 

Shall to those of Hellas change." 

Still another strain, this time stately and austere, 
breathes from the noble ode " Corda Concordia," 
written for the opening in 1881 of the Concord 



School of Philosophy. The poem ends with these 
fine stanzas : 

" So come when long grass waves 

Above the holiest graves 

Of them whose ripe adventure chides our own 
Come where the great elms lean 
Their quivering leaves and green 
To shade the moss- clung roofs now sacred grown, 
And where the bronze and granite tell 
How Liberty was hailed with life's farewell. 

" Here let your Academe 

Be no ignoble dream, 

But consecrate with life and death and song, 
Through the land's spaces spread 
The trust inherited, 

The hope which from your hands shall take no wrong, 
And build an altar that may last 
Till heads now young be laurelled with the Past." 

As a writer of poems dedicated to persons or in- 
spired by occasions, Mr. Stedman at his best is not 
surpassed by any of his fellow-singers. The " com- 
memorations" section of his new volume gives us, 
in such poems as that last mentioned, a music and 
an ethical passion combined beyond which even 
Lowell did not go, in the "Ubi Sunt Qui ante Nos" 
with such touches as 
"There the blithe divines, that fear no more the midnight 

chimes, sit each 
With his halo tilted a trifle, and his harp at easy reach " 

a lambent humor that Holmes never bettered; and 
in the exquisite sonnet " Ad Vigilem," addressed to 
the poet who had inspired the blank verse of " Ad 
Vatem " a score of years before a note of tender 
reverence that is all his own. And even yet we 
have not tasted all the varied richness of this vol- 
ume. The considerable section of lyrics and descrip- 
tive pieces styled collectively " The Carib Sea " has 
put the color and the languorous passion of the 
tropics into verse so exquisite that the lack of space 
which forbids us further quotations seems more 
oppressive than usual ; while the closing poem, an 
ode written for the Shelley centenary, brings to a 
worthy end the most precious volume of American 
poetry that has seen the light for many years. It 
seems to us the most important volume that the 
author has ever produced, for it exhibits the restraint 
of the full-grown artistic consciousness in combina- 
tion with the qualities that we most associate with 
youth the freshness of feeling and the ardor that 
the advancing years of the poet have had the singu- 
lar happiness to preserve uncooled and undimmed. 
The best of our other poets must suffer in com- 
parison with Mr. Stedman, but there is still a niche 
in the temple of song for such sincere and fastidious 
verse as is found in Mr. Robert Underwood John- 
son's new volume, " Songs of Liberty, and Other 
Poems." Better, in our judgment, than Mr. John- 
son's more pretentious poems is the tender senti- 
ment of such a lyric as " Oh, Waste No Tears." 

"Not for the flaws of life shall fall 
The tear most exquisita ah, no ; 

But for its fine perfections all : 
For morning's joyous overflow, 

For sunset's fleeting festival, 
And what midwinter moons may show ;

" For wild-rose breath of Keats' s line ; 

For Titian's rivalry of June ; 
For Chopin's tender notes that twine 

The sense in one autumnal tone ; 
For Brunelleschi's dome divine, 

In wonder planned, with worship hewn.*' 

An interesting section of this volume is devoted to 
a series of paraphrases from the Servian poet, Lmai 
lovan lovanovich, made with the help of Mr. Nikola 
Tesla. They give English students of poetry to 
understand, not for the first time, the meaning of 
the quatrain which we reproduce. 

" ' Why,' yon ask, ' has not the Servian perished, 

Snch calamities about him throng ? ' 
With the sword alike the lyre he cherished : 

He is saved by song ! " 

Mr. Johnson closes his volume with a plea, both 
reasoned and impassioned, for a closer kinship of 
feeling between the two great branches of the En- 
glish race. The thought, so dear to the finer spirits 
of both peoples, has seldom found better expression 
than in this poem, " Hands Over Sea," from which 
we may make one characteristic extract. 

" True, there are those of onr impassioned blood 
Who can forget bnt slowly that thy great 
Misread the omens of oar later strife, 
And knew not Freedom when she called to thee. 
These think they hate thee ! these, who have embraced 
Before the altar their fraternal foes ! 
Not white of York and red of Lancaster 
More kindly mingle in thy rose of peace 
Than blend in cloudless dawn onr blue and gray. 
Already Time and History contend 
For sinking rampart and the grassy ridge 
That with its challenge startles pilgrim feet 
Along the fringes of the wounded wood. 
The bedtime wonder of onr children holds 
Vicksburg coeval with the siege of Troy. 
And the scorned slave so hastened to forgive 
The scar has lost remembrance of the huh." 

Mr. Richard Burton's second volume of verse, 
Memorial Day, and Other Poems," exhibits a dis- 
tinct advance over " Dumb in June," his first. He 
has much to learn or perhaps we should say to 
practice of the technique of his art, but his verse 
already shows marked poetical feeling, and an in- 
stinct for the right thing in form and expression. We 
read him at his best in such a piece as " My Poets." 

" I saw them in my dreams, a goodly band 
With lyre of gracious make within each hand, 
A laurel wreath upon each shining head, 
All young as youth and all fair- garmented. 

" They swept the strings beside a magic sea 
That ever beat its waves in melody 
Upon a shore where blooms immortal sprang 
Between their feet, for solace while they sang. 

" I waked, and saw them in the light of day : 
A motley crowd, for some were bent and gray, 
And some clothed on with rags and hollow-eyed, 
And others limped, as they had journeyed wide. 

" And oftenwhiles they sang when racked with pain, 
Or spake of field and flower, of Love's domain, 
When mured about by sad and noisome sights 
And lacking air and space and May delights. 

"And yet methinks I love their motley more 
Than those dream-singers that I saw before ; 
And yet methinks they looked of heavenly race 
By some strange token on their brow and face ! " 



In one of the stanzas of " Memorial Day " we find 
an echo of the prayer embodied in the poem above 
quoted from, " Hands Over Sea." 

" Nay, on this day memorial ne'er forget 

The visioned good, the revelation august 
Of Peace betwixt the peoples : may we let 

Onr martial blood be cleansed of any lust 
Of war, and this America clasp hands 
Close with the parent English, two proud binds 
Before the world who let their weapons rust." 

We cannot come across this sentiment too often in 
American poetry. 

It was a year ago that we hailed in a modest 
pamphlet of verse sent us by Mr. Edwin Arlington 
Robinson a strong and distinctive note of song, and 
we are glad that the privately printed booklet has 
now been brought to the sight of a wider public. 
It is not strictly the same volume, for there are a 
number of new pieces, while the old ones are re- 
vised and rearranged. " The Children of the 
Night " gives a title to this new volume. Note- 
worthy among the added verses are a number of 
gnomic "Octaves," for one of which we may find 
space. 

" Nor jewelled phrase nor mere mellifluous rhyme 
Reverberates aright, or ever shall 
One cadence of that infinite plain-song 
Which is itself all music. Stronger notes 
Than any that have ever touched the world 
Must ring to tell it ring like hammer-blows, 
Right-echoed of a chime primordial, 
On anvils, in the gleaming of God's forge." 

Mr. Henry Rutgers Remsen seeks to attract 
attention to his verse by printing it on thick gray 
paper which makes the print difficult to read, and 
by a form of binding so peculiar that we should 
find it difficult to describe. Such adventitious allure- 
ments are apt to betoken scant literary art, and are 
not in the best of taste. The volume is called 
" The Daughter of Ypocas, and Other Verse." Its 
opening is guarded about by several pieces of which 
we have failed to get any definite impression. The 
first of them is a plea for some ideal which we must 
confess our inability to understand, and closes with 
the startling line, 

*' Or else hearest thon the voice ? America is Rome." 
Is this an A. P. A. manifesto ? The Daughter of 
Ypocas, " moon-child, maiden of magical spells," is 
a queer creature with whom we should prefer not 
to associate. " Padre Mateo " yields a very taking 
rhyme, 

" All the loathsomeness 
Of filthy rags that showed her sloathsomeness." 

It has a jabberwocky sound, and we rather like it. 
Later in the volume we find some fairly satisfactory 
verse. This echo from " The Prisoner of Zenda," 
for example : 

" Love is not all. Ah, would that it might be ! 

Stilled would the spirit sleep within the breast ! 
And life would seem but love's eternity, 

Circled with kisses like the laurel-tree 
Folded with sunshine's passion. Aye, the West 

Would meet the East, and bid the day-cares flee. 
If love were all ; if love were only best."

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16, 



This also is a pretty stanza : 

" Deeply wrapped in All Saints' peace 
Earth lay like a lover keeping 
Watch and ward o'er Summer's sleeping 
In the City of Surcease." 

In short, Mr. Remsen exhibits a pretty talent when 
he deals with simple forms and sentiments, but suf- 
fers something like shipwreck in his more ambitious 
ventures. Yet even here we must qualify, for it is 
certainly ambitious to translate the "Atys," and 
Mr. Remsen has done it with considerable success. 
Such misprints as " fun'rel," " similies," and " linia- 
ments " we cannot help viewing with suspicion. 

A modest little book of modest and pleasing verses 
is the " Shadows " of Mr. Howe. There are bits of 
description, retrospective glimpses with the proper 
tinge of melancholy, and echoes from the author's 
favorite poets. An example is " Before the Snow." 
"The yellow flame of goldenrod 

Is spent, and by the road instead, 
The flowers, like smoke-wreaths o'er the sod, 

Hang burned and dead ! 
" The sumac cones of crimson show 

Beyond the roadsides, black and charred ; 
The trees, a bloodless, ashen row, 

Stand autumn-scarred. 
" Dark are the field-fires of the year ; 
Let all the flickering embers die ! 
Without, the cold white days are near ; 
Within are warmth and you, and I." 

Mr. George Horton is putting to good uses the 
leisure hours of his consular position. His " Aph- 
rdessa " is the third or fourth volume that has come 
to him since he took his post at Athens, and is marked 
by the same good taste and sincerity of purpose that 
distinguished the others. The titular poem is, more- 
over, the most nearly perfect thing that the author 
has yet done, a pastoral tinged with the sensuous 
glow of Keats, and telling a lovely tale, woven of 
charming fancies, concerning a new Endymion. We 
extract this exquisite lyric : 

"Who would catch a Nereid maid 

He must follow, follow 
Fleetly on through sunny glade 
And through sylvan hollow. 
Come away at early morn 
If you love me, mortal, 
While the knight bee winds his horn 

At the rose's portal." 

Three or four other pieces, all upon Greek themes, 
make up the remaining contents of this little book. 
Mr. John Vance Cheney's new volume, " Out of 
the Silence," is made up in part of pieces heretofore 
unprinted in collected form, in part of revised ver- 
sions of the poems published in two earlier volumes. 
Of the new pieces, the best seem to be a series of 
lyrics dedicated to the several months. Here is a 
" December " sonnet : 

" And wherewithal shall Earth be clothed, to-day ? 
What music will she make, and speak what word, 
What beauty have, before unseen, unheard ; 
How will she stand, and what thing will she say ? 
She thinks not of one loveliness of May, 
Of any bloom of June, or singing bird, 
Of any autumn hue ; white-robed, unstirred 
By faintest breath, she speeds the light away. 



White-robed and voiceless, yet in mead or bough 

Never before so beautiful ; pure, still, 

A virgin, mindful only of her vow, 

She chooses well ; fitly will she fulfil 

The sacred rite. 'T is dusk ; she sees it now 

Once more, the star upon the Syrian hill." 

This is Mr. Cheney at his best ; at his second best, he 
too often has a catchy and whimsical utterance that 
seriously disturbs the flow of poetical feeling. 

" The choir invisible we praise ; 
But I would join the choir I see, 
Of noble souls, who, glad and free, 
The living of the world upraise." 

This stanza serves as comment upon the title, 
" The Choir Visible," given by Mrs. Charles Kendall 
Adams to her volume of verse. It also strikes the 
keynote of the contents, which express, in various 
measures, one constant glow of love for mankind, 
one constant aspiration toward the divine. The 
diction of these pieces is simplicity itself : but they 
are informed by a large sincerity that lends to the 
simplest phrases both beauty and strength. Since 
the religious motive is prominent throughout, we 
cannot do better than quote from the book one of 
its most distinctively religious utterances, " Light at 
Eventide." 

" If shadows overcast my morn 

And clouds its sunlight hide, 
I only ask thee, Lord, to send 

Thy light at eventide. 

" Though storms still hide my sun at noon, 

And darkness yet abide, 
My soul submissive only pleads 
For light at eventide. 

" And while I plead, I know, O Christ, 

If I am near Thy side, 
Life's storms will end in peace at last 
And light at eventide." 

The volume includes a considerable series of sonnets, 
and a number of poems written for occasions. 

Miss Kimball's " Victory, and Other Verses " 
offers a collection of pleasing and finished work, 
subjective for the most part, and dealing with the 
abstractions that betoken a reflective rather than a 
creative mind. There is in them a marked religious 
note, attuned to the subtle harmonies of mysticism, 
which is well illustrated by the long poem which 
gives a title to the volume. We quote a few verses, 
expressive of the final vision of peace vouchsafed to 
the soul that has held its own against the leagued 
powers of darkness. 

" Even as I gazed, that Power that slew my heart, 
My life itself, turned to a spectral thing, 
Such as one pure and perfect thought pricks through ; 
And darkness was annihilate by Light. 
Then from the battlements, I saw the clouds, 
Thinning to gray, sail swiftly past the sun ; 
He pierced them with his golden arrows keen ; 
And bade them hasten as they passed his throne ; 
And some he riddled through and through, and turned 
To veils of iridescent pearliness, 
That melted swiftly, imperceptibly, 
Till last he shone triumphant from clear space ; 
And Earth was glad, and sang his victory, 
And told the tale of darkness he had slain, 
Through the full throat of all her inborn life." 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



51 



Nature is almost the sole inspiration of Miss 
Evaleen Stein's "One Way to the Woods," as, 
indeed, the subject of this title poem would indicate. 
A typical stanza is the following, from "Flood- 
Time on the Marshes ": 

" Where, fringed with lacy fronds of fern, 

The grass grows rich and high, 
And flowering spider-worts have caught 

The color of the sky ; 
Where water-oaks are thickly strung 

With green and golden balls, 
And from tall tilting iris-tips 

The wild canary calls." 

This sort of landscape inventory is one of the com- 
monest features of modern minor verse, and it is 
usually so well done that we cannot escape wonder- 
ing at the thoroughness with which one, at least, of 
Tennyson's lessons has been learned by his latter- 
day disciples. 

The " Songs Ysame " of Mrs. Annie Fellows 
Johnston and Mrs. Albion Fellows Bacon (two sis- 
ters, apparently) present nothing particularly note- 
worthy. From the first-named of the two we select 
" Spring's Cophetua." 

" She came with garments scant and poor and thin, 

And white feet gleaming bare ; 
With pallid smiles where April tears had been, 
And snowflakes on her hair. 

" Oh, never Winter thought such gentle look 

In all the land was seen ! 
From his gray locks the diadem he took 
And crowned her as his queen. 

"And now, in silken robes and gowns arrayed, 

Fair Spring reigns in his stead. 
Upon his throne she sits, the beggar maid 
' Cophetua ' is dead." 

The second writer yields a pretty elegy on " Ophelia." 

" Calm dost thon lie in wave-swept resting-place. 
No more the glances of the haughty Dane 
Can fill thy gentle breast with longing vain. 
The waves that stilled thy heart have drowned thy pain, 
And washed the sorrow from thy sweet, pale face, 
Ophelia. 

" Thine be the violets, but his the rue. 
Though hope should sleep, and deep regret should wake, 
Thy clasped hand from Death's he could not take ; 
The spell on those mute lips he could not break. 
What more with life and love hast thon to do, 
Ophelia?" 

" Love's Way " is a " monodrama," and the hero- 
ine's name is Lilian. The story of the poet's love 
is told in a series of lyrics, various in form, and, 
unlike the story of " Maud," ends with the chime of 
wedding bells. Mr. Swift's " other poems " are two 
long essays in heroic verse, " The Vision of Galileo " 
and "Heracles upon CEta," both dignified and finely 
wrought, and a few short pieces. Our selection 
must perforce be made from the latter, and so we 
take the sonnet " Far above Rubies." 

" All that we dream of gracious or divine 
In woman hath its type ; each holy sprite, 
Poet or seer, or saintly eremite, 
Resembles woman ; all that doth refine 
The arts, the manners, to her sway benign 
Owes high allegiance ; all things fair and right 
Her weakness champions in the world's despite : 



Where woman is, no home but hath a shrine ; 
How oft, alas, profaned ! Men crucify 

Her gentle spirit, and to shame betray 
Her innocence with a kiss ; her agony 

And sweat of blood the winds that ever stray 
Forever witness ; and her bitter cry 

Goes up to heaven for vengeance, night and day." 

We trust that Mr. Benjamin Sledd is not as mel- 
ancholy a person in real life as his verses would 
make him out to be. His songs " From Cliff and 
Scaur " have their being in deep gloom, relieved by 
hardly an occasional ray of light. This, for exam- 
ple, is the sort of thing he gives us : 

" No life was there in that lone land : 
Or only lived the shuddering sand, 
Blind, hungry thing, 

Which round my helpless feet would cling 
And strive to clasp me fast 
In its cold arms. There was no light, 
And yet I felt that height on height 
Shut in the dead black vast." 

The trouble with Mr. Sledd's gloom is that it is not 
convincing. He leads us to no " city of dreadful 
night " in which he has long sojourned, but rather 
bids us share a perverse mood that he has forced 
upon himself for literary effect. 

We have examined every page of " The Death of 
Falstaff, and Other Poems," hoping that the vol- 
ume might yield some bit of verse with the touch of 
distinction upon it, but the search has been in vain. 
We can find nothing better than such a stanza as 
this: 

" Tell me, Lady Moon, though morning 

Beckon from the distant hill, 
Where my lady lies, adorning 
Sleep itself, do dreams distill 
Songs more sweet than bird can trill 
In the day-dawn when it hovers 

Songs my happy name containing ? 
Ah, no longer fear complaining 
That you are too kind to lovers ! " 

Of such commonplace texture is Mr. Moore's verse 
throughout, sometimes stilted, but never inspired. 

A breath of gentle melancholy fills Dr. Watson's 
"Songs of Flying Hours," a collection of poems 
which exhibit considerable technical skill, a wide 
range of serious thought, and a certain command of 
felicitous diction. They are verses of which no man 
would need to be ashamed, yet they are such verses 
as hundreds of men can write equally well. We 
reprint the sonnet-like poem called " Death." 

" And if we sleep ? If souls go out and die, 
As soft notes die upon the evening air, 
And if we fade and wither like a sigh, 
As fade the flowers that are so wondrous fair, 
Why should we grieve ? The life we lose was sweet, 
Or it was bitter good to have or lose ; 
And sleep comes soft, and no man may refuse 
The summons when he hears its stealthy feet. 
And if it lead us through the dark, blindfold, 
To where, we know not : still the hour may come 
When, with our eyes unbound, we may behold 
Whatever waits a prison or a home ; 
Or will it lead, still on, with fainter tread, 
Into some voiceless land, and leave us dead? " 

There is much verse of this grave meditative sort in 



52 



[Jan. 16, 



Dr. Watson's volume ; it is too vague to make a 
sharp impression, and too diffuse to make a lasting 
one. 

The greater part of Mr. Van Zile's volume is 
made up of such verse as journalism begets, verse 
that cares more for a " point " than for an idea, and 
is not meant to be taken seriously. Occasionally, as 
in " The Unknown Sea," the author rises above this 
plane and achieves melodious stanzas. 

" Long ere Columbus sailed the unknown sea, 

Upon the sands a lonely dreamer lay, 
And, gazing westward, sought to pierce the void 
Beyond the sky-line's unresponsive gray. 

" There at his feet the ocean, throbbing, strove 

To tell its secret to the weary soul, 
But knowing not the language of the sea 
He heard no message in the billows' roll. 

" Beyond the mist, where sky and ocean met, 
Reposed the waiting islands of the West, 
But naught the dreamer learned save that his heart 
Grew heavy with the vainness of his quest. 

" So are we dreamers on the strand of life, 
Scanning an ocean heeding not our cry ; 
And, dim with tears, our straining eyes see not 
The smiling islands of the bye-and-bye." 

With Mr. Irving Browne's " House of the Heart " 
we reach the end of this review of recent American 
poetry, and to the end of Mr. Browne's book do we 
turn for our final excerpts. There are, indeed, 
temptations by the way, for the author's humorous 
fancies are often very cleverly expressed, but we 
have found nothing better or more characteristic 
than the series of short poems on " The Moon as 
Viewed by Various Persons." First, there is the 
young woman, who is sentimental, then the physi- 
cian, who is practical. The one says : 

" Under the moon my lover walks with me, 

And swears his love will never know eclipse," 
while the other comments grimly : 

" The moon is my good patron, fruitful source 

Of aches and pains and cold is moonlight walk." 

The painter is vexed because he does not know how 
large to make the moon on his canvas, while the 
burglar objects to it for rising at a most inopportune 
hour. The astronomer remarks that he can no 
longer be expected to be devout at sight of a moon 
which reveals only 

" A lot of empty craters, 

Dotting her surface like huge nutmeg graters," 
and the farmer complains that 

" That pesky moon is always wet or dry, 

A turnin' down or up her darned old horn, 
A rottin' all the taters and the rye, 
Or burnin' up the garden-sass and corn." 

Thus the practically- minded. The poet, meanwhile, 
sees nought of these things, but instead this vision : 
"And still the moon moves on in God's highway, 

Heedless alike of fond Endymion's sighs, 
Of querulous man's lament, of watchdog's bay, 
And shows nor scorn nor pity nor surprise. 
So shall she move, until this trivial world, 
In hopeless ruin and confusion hurled, 
Lies shattered at the awful judgment day."

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The period of the Renaissance has 
for some time been a matter of cul- 
tivated acquaintance and interest. 
Such a book as " Earthwork out of Tuscany " shows 
that Ruskin and Symonds and Pater, as well as 
many another too in other ways than those of liter- 
ature proper, have so familiarized us with the gen- 
eral outline of Italian art and life, that a book which 
assumed really a great deal would find many readers. 
It is chiefly in painting, to tell the truth, that this 
interest manifests itself, but Renaissance painting 
has given reflected interest to many things else. 
One rather marked exception, however, is architec- 
ture. In the popular mind the architecture of the 
Renaissance has never taken a place alongside of 
painting and poetry. In fact, to many the idea of 
Renaissance architecture has been accursed, in ac- 
cord with the well-known views of Mr. Ruskin as 
expressed in " The Stones of Venice." This may 
have been partly because there was already a strong 
architectural favorite in the public mind, namely 
Gothic architecture, a favorite which had had 
Scott and Pusey as sponsers and the great cathe- 
drals of Europe as its own intrinsic merit. The 
victory of Gothic had been won during the century 
over the weak followers not so much of Palladio 
even, as of Mansard and the Barocco artists, and 
the popular mind did not incline to see excellence in 
that which had been but recently displaced. These 
types, however, had not much connection with the 
Renaissance, they were really but remnants, as it 
were. Mr. Anderson's book on " Italian Renais- 
sance Architecture" (imported by Scribner) deals 
with the real Renaissance, with the sixteenth cen- 
tury, with the period from Brunaleschi to Palladio. 
It is based on lectures given before the Glasgow 
School of Art, and has, as the author observes, " a 
rudimentary and popular character " which recom- 
mends it to the untechnicai reader. It is further 
very fully illustrated with excellent pictures, so that 
it is not onry intelligible but useful. It will be found, 
on the whole, rather more available than anything 
else on the subject that we know of. 

It is always important to compare the 

Disquisitions on the e i_ 

Dandiacal Soul. opinions of great men on great sub- 
jects. Hence the debt which the 
thinking world owes to Mr. Jacobs for his presenta- 
tion of the views of Walter Pater and Maurice 
Barres on the Blessedness of Egoism. It is by such 
work that we in America are able to keep in touch 
with the advancing thought of the Old World. 
Another opportunity is now at hand. American 
readers can at last weigh against Mr. Max Beer- 
bohm's theory of Dandyism the estimate of Barkey 
D'Aurevilly. It has long been known that there 
was a difference of opinion, but so far Mr. Beer- 
bohm has had the advantage of the last word in a 
case where the first had never been heard. For, 
beyond the mention in " Dandies and Dandyism," 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



53 



we fear that Barkey D'Aurevilly has heretofore 
been largely conceived in America merely as a per- 
son who delighted in the use of inks of various 
colors and wore rose-colored silk hats and gold-lace 
neckties, facts drawn from a book entitled u Degen- 
eration." The widely-read author of that entertain- 
ing work inferred hysteria from the violent colors 
and ego-mania from the hats and cravats. Mr. 
Douglas Ainslie, however, who now presents us with 
a translation " Of Dandyism and of George Brum- 
mell" (Copeland & Day), does not seem to agree 
with the great scourge of letters ; he would seem to 
regard these matters as unimportant. Certainly they 
cannot be weighed in importance with the great 
fundamental question. And here it must first be 
remarked that our two authorities differ in more 
respects than had been previously mentioned. They 
disagree not only in theory, but on facts. For 
instance, although they agree that it was not a fool- 
ish fancy for a uniform that led Brummell to join 
the Tenth Hussars, they differ as to his reasons for 
leaving the corps. Mr. Beerbohm says it was be- 
cause of a reprimand for appearing on parade in a 
blue tunic : Barkey D'Aurevilly says that it was 
because the regiment was ordered to Birmingham. 
Let not such differences seem insignificant. Where 
facts differ, theories will differ, at least they ought 
to. The real difference between these two thinkers 
may perhaps be traced to some such variation in 
fact as this. Of the two, it is obvious that Mr. Beer- 
bohm upholds the aesthetic doctrine, while Barkey 
D'Aurevilly is distinctly ethical in his treatment. 
One thinks of Dandyism as an exquisite art, the 
other conceives it as an exquisite way of life. The 
difference is of course fundamental, and our readers 
will wish to pursue it and to decide for themselves. 
We recommend to them this translation with confi- 
dence. Its appearance, in type, paper, and binding, 
is worthy of its topic, and its topic is worthy of those 
who can appreciate it. 

The late Professor Palgrave set for 
himself so high a standard of taste 
and discernment in that Golden 
Treasury" (Macmillan) which has by common 
acclaim been received as the best of English an- 
thologies that we were prepared to find in his 
" second series " of the publication, covering the 
period since 1850, a work somewhat less satisfactory 
than its predecessor. But we did not anticipate so 
marked a falling-off, or a selection distinguished by 
so much unevenness, as the new anthology reveals. 
It was not Professor Palgrave's fault that copyright 
considerations prevented the inclusion of anything 
by Morris or Mr. Swinburne although a Victorian 
anthology without these poets seems hardly worth 
making, so unrepresentative must it be but the 
judgment was surely at fault that exalted such 
minor poets as O'Shaughnessy and William Barnes 
as we find them exalted in this volume. These 
writers have seventeen and twelve poems, respect- 
ively, in the collection, as against one each from 



Two new 

Golden 

Treasuries. 



Landor, Peacock, and Mr. Aubrey De Vere. The 
lapses from a balanced critical judgment in the 
selections from such men as Kingsley, Arnold, and 
Patmore seem to us also very noticeable. Of course, 
the contents of the volume are still " choicely good," 
but we expected more than that from the editor of 
the first " Golden Treasury." Mr. Frederic Law- 
rence Knowles, in his " Golden Treasury of Amer- 
ican Songs and Lyrics" (Page), has brought together 
one hundred and forty-seven poems by sixty-one 
writers from Freneau to Mr. Lloyd Mifflin. Fre- 
neau's " The Wild Honeysuckle " fitly ushers in such 
a collection as this, but Mr. Mifflin's pretentious 
sonnets have by no means won for him a deserved 
place among our poets. Poe has no less than nine 
lyrics, the largest representation given to any poet. 
Whitman is excluded, with regret, for reasons that 
we must respect, although the canon is questionable 
that cannot overlook considerations of form in a 
case like his. Mr. Knowles has done his work 
with taste and discretion, for the most part, although 
it may hardly be taken as more than a tentative 
effort toward that definitive anthology which we 
hope for in the future. The volume is exceptionally 
charming from the mechanical point of view, and 
does great credit to the new house whose imprint it 
bears. 



"Music: 
Itt Ideal* 
and Methods. 



Mr. W. S. B. Mathews has recently 
brought together into a sizable vol- 
ume nearly two score brief essays 
upon various aspects of the art of music, both theo- 
retical and practical. These articles are reprinted 
from the periodicals to which Mr. Mathews has been 
a contributor of late years largely, in fact, from 
the excellent monthly magazine " Music " of which 
he is the editor and are now published by Mr. 
Theodore Presser, of Philadelphia. Mr. Mathews 
is one of the few American writers about music who 
really have something substantial to say. Over- 
much journalism has set its mark upon his style, 
and his manner of writing often degenerates into a 
slapdash utterance that is anything but commend- 
able ; yet there is always a serious reflective basis 
for what he says, and he not infrequently has at his 
command the felicitous phrase and the symmetri- 
cally crystallized expression of his thought. Few 
writers with whom we are acquainted have come as 
near as Mr. Mathews comes, when in his best and 
most serious moods, to finding adequate words for 
the expression of what is essential about musical art 
in general, or about some form or illustration of 
that art in particular. He never gets far away from 
the fundamental thought that music provides men 
with one of the deepest forms of culture, and that 
all questions of technique and pedagogical method 
should be held strictly subordinate to that idea. The 
root of the matter is in such a passage as the fol- 
lowing : " For by just so much as music says some- 
thing to those who give themselves up to it, by just 
so much it becomes a force with influence upon their 
lives, and upon their doing and being. And so we

[Jan. 16, 



may look for a time when this force will be under- 
stood and intelligently employed in education, as it 
sometimes begins to be now ; but upon wider and 
higher scale, until many things which have not 
yielded to the pulpit nor yet to the press, will soften 
themselves to music. Who knows? The Pytha- 
gorean tuning of mind by means of tones will be- 
come a reality ; and it will sometime be found that 
the intellect is sharpened and the imagination 
kindled by tonal fantasy, not merely for itself, but 
for great and noble deeds." We may fairly call 
this the language of prophecy, for few even among 
professional musicians have yet conceived of their 
art in this significant sense, the sense in which it 
offers not merely entertainment or beguilement, but 
rather education in the truest and best meaning of 
the term. We do not always agree with Mr. Mathews 
in his special dicta. Sometimes we disagree with 
him so vehemently that words could hardly express 
our feeling. How can a man say that " there is not 
an element of the ideal " in " Tristan und Isolde " ? 
But we are in the deepest accord with a writer who 
can speak words like these: "With steady step music 
has progressed towards the art of saying something 
to human souls. Out of the vast inner world of the 
Unseen, the Blest, and the Eternal, the prophetic 
seer brings in tones his living and moving message. 
We do not need a story ; we do not need an expla- 
nation. Simply to hear and hear again, and to be 
silent and hear again this is the road and the 
only road. These great works are written like the 
messages of inspiration ' for those who have ears to 
hear.' The inner message of music, like the inner 
tone of the creation, is for him who listens within." 
" Durch alle Tone tonet, 
Im bunten Lebenstraum, 
Ein leiser Ton gezogen 
Fiir den, der beimlich lauschet." 

These words, which Schumann took as a text for 
his wonderful " Fantaisie, Op. 17," belong, in a wider 
sense, to all great music, and this is the truth that 
Mr. Mathews embodies in many a chapter of his 
stimulating book. 

We believe that the nature of a man's 
mind gives the form to his style. We 
even believe that, given the technical 
characteristics of any piece of writing, one should 
be able to infer the character of the author's mode 
of thought. It must be allowed that literary criti- 
cism is not quite as far advanced on this line as 
might be desired. Still, we feel quite sure that 
there are a number of our readers who can gauge 
pretty exactly the mental calibre of a man who 
writes sentences which are, on the average, from 
eleven to fourteen words long, whose work has a 
distinctly staccato movement due to the constant 
unconnected and direct statements, and who con- 
veys his doctrine one half in epigrammatic generali- 
zations and the other half in metaphors. Such is 
the way Mr. W. A. Quayle expresses his ideas in 
"The Poet's Poet and Other Essays" (Curts & 
Jennings). It is also, we believe, a matter of ex-

pression rather than of idea that he should regard 
the " New Arabian Nights " as " a piece of enchant- 
ing verbiage"; that he should hint that George 
Eliot entertained " nugatory theories of Hebrew 
history "; that he should assert that a particular 
line of " In Memoriam " " keys the music of this 
elegy "; that he should note the place where Haw- 
thorne and Poe " quit company," or that he should 
hold that Hawthorne's " treatment of a theme is 
essentially spirituelle." These are technical points 
of style, and yet we feel sure that they are the ex- 
pression of a particular mode of thought, if we may 
so call it. It is to be remarked, however, that Mr. 
Quayle nowhere makes any claim to the power of 
criticism. He says distinctly that he has loved 
literature, and therefore has written, more doubtless 
with a view " to stimulate affection for the men and 
works he loves " than with any idea of pronouncing 
sound critical judgments. And that is no mean 
desire. We cannot but think well of the man who 
entertains it, or of the city which seeks these essays 
more eagerly than the latest works of Richard 
Harding Davis or James Lane Allen. Still, we 
cannot quite agree with Mr. Quayle's publishers 
that " seldom have such personalities as Browning 
... or such epochal characters as Cromwell . . . 
been more vividly reproduced by human pen." We 
are inclined to think that what Mr. Quayle has 
vividly reproduced is the current of his own ideas. 
This is not an especially easy thing to do, but we 
think that in this book it is very effectively done.

tions of Miss Anna L. Bicknell's " Story of Marie 
Antoinette." The work recently formed a leading 
feature of successive numbers of that periodical, and 
it now appears in book form (Century Co.), and a 
very worthy and attractive volume it makes. Miss 
Bicknell has given us the best popularly written life of 
the ill-starred Queen at least we can point to none 
better. She is a good narrator, and wastes no time 
in pointing a moral or adorning a tale that assuredly 
needs neither pointing nor adornment. She shows 
sensibility, without drenching her recital with tears 
like the lachrymose M. de la Rochterie, for ex- 
ample, in whose watery elegiacs over his " mar- 
tyred queen " now over a century dead there is 
just a touch of " Sergeant Buzfuz." One is reminded 
of Mark Twain at the tomb of Adam. Miss Bicknell 
is accurate as to facts, and her judgments are tem- 
perate. She adheres mostly to the generally accepted 
versions of leading incidents. She respects the 
statement that Marie Antoinette, in ascending the 
scaffold, struck the executioner's foot, and apolo- 
gized quickly, with a polite " Pardon, Monsieur. 1 " 
The story seems improbable enough, and it has 
lately been again denied, on the authority of a credi- 
ble eye-witness of the queen's execution. A lady 
(the grandmother of M. de Rochefort) who was 
seated on a cart near the scaffold, testified that " the

queen, frightfully overcome, looked as if she was 
bent double. She was almost lifted onto the plank, 
where she fell without a movement. . . . This [the 
story in question] is pure fable. . . . Marie Antoi- 
nette broke down in the arms of the executioner's 
assistants ; she was laid beneath the knife completely 
inert ; no kick was given ; no dialogue passed be- 
tween her and the executioner ; and if her foot did 
touch his, she was not in a state to perceive it." 
This account of the queen's condition tallies well 
with that terrible sketch of her, as she sat in the 
tumbril, made by David, who saw the cortege pass 
his window. Miss Bicknell's book is exceedingly 
readable the best compact popular Life of Marie 
Antoinette obtainable. It is beautifully illustrated, 
mainly with portraits of the queen and her circle, 
after Mme. Lebrun. 



Peter the Great appears in ordinary 
histories and brief biographies as a 
personage of extraordinary vitality 
and originality, and the exponent of modern prog- 
ress in the civilization of Russia. Whether it is a 
desirable revelation to force upon the general public 
that he was an unspeakably vulgar, unspeakably 
cruel, unspeakably licentious monster, is a question 
which, at any rate, does not seem to have given pause 
to the Russian author of the latest life of Peter, 
translated by Lady Loyd, and published by Messrs. 
Appleton & Co. The author justifies the lurid lights 
which he throws upon his hero and his people on the 
ground that " courage to acknowledge what one is, 
and even what one has been, is a very necessary 
quality." But it is hard to believe that he is a 
genuine admirer of Peter, however much he professes 
to be such. Supported as are the revolting allega- 
tions regarding Peter's beastly life by references to 
contemporary accounts, it seems impossible to deny 
their truthfulness. But what is the use of the author's 
declaring " I can discover nothing in Peter's case 
which would point to the authentic mark of the real 
wild beast the greedy delight in inflicting suffer- 
ing, the downright taste for blood," on the same 
page (125) with the admission that he " pursued 
the men he had doomed to death with reproaches 
and invectives jeered at them even in their death 
agony " ? The author also declares at the close, 
"He thirsted for blood" (page 533). All of the 
real achievements of Peter's reign that are rehearsed 
in this volume are familiar to the world. The 
principal result of publishing the atrocities which 
hitherto have been hidden in rarer volumes and in 
foreign languages must be to make it impossible to 
hear again the name of Peter the Great without 
disgust and loathing. 



Myttifying

A little volume of 120 pages, by 
Mr. Charles H. Mann, entitled " The 
Christ of God " (Putnam), is a mod- 
ern deliverance on the interpretation of the mean- 
ing of the Christ. It requires the patience of a pa- 
triarch and the perseverance of a saint to wade

through it. And what then ? One has the recollec- 
tion of a man who has tramped through a stretch of 
miry road, rather disagreeable and unsatisfactory. 
The author's elaborations are too verbose, his sen- 
tences too long, to conduce to clearness. His theory 
is that the Christ must be interpreted parabolically. 
" Jesus Christ is the very image of God begotten in 
the life of the human race during its spiritual his- 
tory " (page 36). In the unfolding of this thought 
he soars to the regions of the mystical, and fails to 
carry his reader with him. Repeated readings fail 
to make him clear. In handling the so-called vicari- 
ous theory of the atonement as held by some scholars, 
and as contained in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, 
the author simply explains those verses (4 and 5) of 
least difficulty, and lets the reader struggle away 
with the giant difficulties, which he never so much 
as touches. He is apparently not out of the woods 
himself. If he is, let him condense and clarify. 

Of making many Bibles there is no 
end. But of making the ideal Bible 
there is just now a beginning. After 
decades of experience and of experiments, the Oxford 
University Press has achieved a real success in manu- 
facturing Bibles. Their latest product is " The Ox- 
ford Self-Pronouncing Teacher's Bible " of King 
James's version. It is a marvellous piece of book- 
making. It is octavo in form, printed in bourgeois 
type, and occupies the same space as that heretofore 
taken by minion type, two sizes smaller. Every 
proper name is separated into syllables, wherein the 
quality of each is marked and the accented syllable 
noted. This work is done on strictly scientific prin- 
ciples, and is authoritative. Added to the whole 
Bible is a series of 124 full-page plates illustrating 
manuscripts, versions, and antiquities. To this is 
appended " Helps for the Study of the Bible." And 
last, but no less than the climax in Bible-making, is 
the fact that the entire 1624 pages, printed on India 
paper, is just one inch in thickness, or, with strong 
lids of flexible leather, less than one and one-eighth 
inches. In the charm of its typography, in its self- 
pronouncing character, and in its small, convenient 
compass, it is the peer of any Teacher's Bible now 

on the market. . 

Continuing his series of the " Foot- 
P rint8 of the Patriots" ( Lee & Shep- 
ard), Mr. Abram English Brown

Middlesex County, in Massachusetts. Searching out 
the homes of the minute-men who answered Paul 
Revere's alarm " thro' every Middlesex village and 
farm " on April 19, 1775, the author tells us those 
little incidents of their daily lives that make clear to 
us their personality and environment. Among these 
men were many whose names are memorable for 
some great work or deed ; and these visits to their 
old homesteads, the talks with their descendants, the 
glancing into old diaries yellow with age, and the 
inspection of curious relics of those troubled times, 
have afforded material for an interesting and profit-

notable homesteads, relics, documents, quaint tomb- 
stones, and portraits of the patriots and their de- 
scendants. An interesting account is given of the 
first blood shed at Bunker Hill, when Asa Pollard's 
head was taken off by a ball from one of the British 
ships, as the minute-men rested at their noonday meal. 
Another version of the story of " Old Put " and the

BRIEFER MENTION. 

Dr. George McLean Harper has edited for Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. a selection from Sainte-Beuve's 
" Causeries du Lundi," seven in number, including 
" Qu'est-ce qu'un Classique ? " " Grande Epoque de la 
Prose," and the studies of Pascal, La Fontaine, Saint- 
Simon, Madame de Maintenon, and La Duchesse de 
Bourgoyne. The work is well done, and the author is 
one of the most important to be taken up in advanced 
courses. What gives the book its special distinction, 
however, is the elaborate prefatory essay on Sainte- 
Beuve, which reminds us to say that much of the best 
critical writing of the present day in this country is to 
be found in just such school-books as this, a fact quite 
as important for the general reader to know as for the 
person of strictly pedagogic intent. Such books as this 
belong quite as much in the private libraries of culti- 
vated persons as in the class-rooms of the colleges. 

It is with much satisfaction that we commend the 
enterprise of Messrs. Small, Maynard, & Co., a new 
firm of Boston publishers, in producing for the first time 
a tasteful and adequate edition of Walt Whitman's 
poems. We have been compelled hitherto to put up 
with editions as far removed from the traditions of ar- 
tistic publishing as the " Leaves of Grass " themselves 
are removed from the traditions of the poetic art. The 
handsome volume now before us remedies all this, and 
gives us, within a single set of covers, the complete poet- 
ical works of Whitman, including " Sands at Seventy," 
" Good-bye, My Fancy," and " Old Age Echoes," besides 
the prose " Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads." 

Mr. James Whitcomb Riley is the latest American 
writer to receive the somewhat premature honors of a 
uniform subscription edition of his works. It is styled 
the " Homestead " edition, and Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons are the publishers. There are to be ten vol- 
umes in all, similar in get-up to the editions of Stevenson, 
Field, and Mr. J. M. Barrie already published by this 
enterprising firm. "Neighborly Poems and Dialect 
Sketches " is the title of the first volume, now before us. 

" Nineteenth Century Questions" (Houghton) is the 
title of a volume of essays prepared for publication by 
the late James Freeman Clarke shortly before his death, 
and now placed before the public. The questions dis- 
cussed fall . into three groups " Literary Studies," 
" Religious and Philosophical," and " Historical and 
Biographical." They include, among others, " Did 
Shakespeare write Bacon's Works ? " " Have Animals 
Souls?" "Affinities of Buddhism and Christianity," 
" Buckle and His Theory of Averages," and " The Rise 
and Fall of Slave Power in America " nineteenth 
century questions indeed, yet having a strangely old- 
fashioned ring in these closing years of the century.

published by the American Book Co., and intended for 
use as a supplementary reading-book in schools. 

" Cosmopolis " will soon publish three " Odes in Con- 
tribution to the Song of French History," by Mr. 
George Meredith. They will have for their subjects 
the Revolution, Napoleon, and Alsace-Lorraine. 

Volume VI. of Miss Wormeley's translation of Mo- 
lie"re, published by Messrs. Roberts Brothers, includes 
" L'Etourdi," " Le Mariage Force'," " Le Medecin 
malgr^ Lui," and " La Critique de PEcole des Fernmes." 

Messrs. Funk & Wagnalls Co. have just published 
Volume III. of " The Reader's Shakespeare," containing 
the comedies, edited by Mr. David Charles Bell. In 
this work, it will be remembered, the plays are condensed 
for the use of schools and for public readings. 

Messrs. Curts & Jennings are the publishers of a 
" Manual of Ecclesiastical Architecture," by Professor 
William Wallace Martin. It is a well-printed and 
profusely-illustrated work of over four hundred pages, 
simple in style and serviceable in arrangement. 

A pretty little volume, just issued by the Oxford 
University Press, is Mr. Arthur C. Downer's exhaustive 
study and analysis of " The Odes of Keats." Among 
the illustrations in the book is a fine view of the Ameri- 
can Memorial to Keats, in Hampstead Parish Church. 

Mr. J. H. Hyde, president of the Cercle Franc.ais of 
Harvard University, has just presented that society 
with the sum of thirty thousand dollars. The interest 
will be applied to an annual lectureship, to be filled by 
distinguished Frenchmen, of whom M. Rene" Doumic is 
to be the first. 

The January " International Studio," published by 
Mr. John Lane, is an especially interesting issue of that 
beautiful magazine. Illustrated articles on the land- 
scape paintings of Prince Eugen of Sweden and on the 
colored prints of Mr. W. P. Nicholson are among the 
noteworthy features of the number. 

The third annual volume of " Good Reading," pub- 
lished by Mr. T. Fisher Unwin of London, is made up 
of short selections, chosen by the authors themselves, 
from the recent books of that publisher. A number of 
interesting portraits and a short introduction by Mr. 
Unwin are also contained in the volume. 

Recent texts for teachers of English include Carlyle's 
Essay on Burns (Ginn), edited by Mr. Charles L. 
Hanson; Tennyson's " The Princess " (Ginn), edited by 
Professor A. S. Cook; Milton's " Lycidas " (Ginn), 
edited by Dr. John Phelps Fruit; "Selections from

Paradise Lost'" (Heath), edited by Mr. Albert 
Perry Walker; and Carlyle's " Hero- Worship " (Mac- 
millan), edited by Mrs. Annie Russell Marble. 

" The Westminster " is the title of a weekly religious 
paper, published at Toronto, and formed by the amal- 
gamation of an older paper bearing the same name 
with " The Canada Presbyterian " and " The Presbyter." 
The result is a periodical, half newspaper and half 
magazine, with forty-eight pages to the number. 

Four new volumes have lately been added to the hand- 
some " Illustrated English Library " (imported by Put- 
nam). These consist of Charlotte Bronte's " Shirley," 
Scott's " Rob Roy," and Thackeray's " Pendennis " and 
"Vanity Fair." Mr. F. H. Townsend is the illustrator 
of the first two volumes, and Miss Chris. Hammond of 
the other two. 

" Pictures in the National Gallery " is the title of an 
important art work announced for early publication by 
Mr. Franz Hanfstaengl of New York. In addition to 
a number of text illustrations, the work will contain 
one hundred large photogravure plates, with descriptive 
text by Mr. Charles Locke Eastgate, Keeper and Sec- 
retary of the National Gallery. 

" A Century of American Statesmen " is the title of a 
forthcoming work by Professor Moses Coit Tyler, of 
which the Messrs. Putnam will be the publishers. It 
will provide a four-volume biographical survey of 
American politics, passing in rapid review the careers 
and political ideas of about forty men, from Jefferson 
and Hamilton down to President McKinley. 

" Lessons in Elementary Botany for Secondary 
Schools," by Professor Thomas H. Mac-bride, is a text- 
book just published by Messrs. Allyn & Bacon. It deals 
chiefly with familiar phaenogamous forms in their more 
striking aspects, although ferns, mosses, and fungi are 
reached before the end. It is a very practical sort of 
book for beginners, and we take pleasure in commend- 
ing it to teachers. 

Practical aid to mothers in the selection of the best 
books for their children to read is offered, in a profes- 
sional way, by Miss Helene L. Dickey, who has given 
much special study to this now important subject, and, 
through her connection with the house of Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co., has acquired a valuable knowledge of its 
bibliography. Miss Dickey may be addressed in the 
care of this firm, at 378 Wabash avenue, Chicago. 

The death of William J. Linton at his New Haven 
home, on the 29th of December, evokes a good many 
memories in the mind of a student of nineteenth-century 
art, literature, and politics. As an artist, he was one of 
the greatest of the fast dying race of wood-engravers, 
a member of many societies, an editor of art journals, 
and an authoritative writer upon his special subject. 
As a man of letters, he produced, besides his technical 
works, several volumes of poems and translations, and 
collaborated with Mr. R. H. Stoddard in the editing of 
one of our best anthologies of English poetry. Litera- 
ture claims him also in an indirect way as the husband 
of Mrs. Lynn Linton. In politics, his activity began 
with the Chartists, among whom he was a leader, and 
continued to exert itself through the various under- 
ground channels controlled by Mazzini, Garibaldi, and 
Louis Blanc, all of whom were his friends. His emigra- 
tion to this country in 1867 removed him from further 
active participation in the European revolutionary move- 
ment. Born in London in 1812, he was eighty-five 
years old when he died.

Many people who have studied English, Latin, and Greek grammar are 
very careless and slovenly punctuators. This book is indispensable to 
all writers. Memorizing rules and exceptions wastes time and they are 
soon forgotten. Also gives rules for placing capital letters and italics,

" Mr. Gosse has been remarkably successful in bringing into focus 
and proportion the salient features of this vast and varied theme. We 
have read the book not only with pleasure but with a singular emotion. " 
London Daily Chronicle. 

" Mr. Gosse's most ambitious book and probably his best. It bears 
on every page the traces of a genuine love for his subject, and of a 
lively critical intelligence. . . . Really a remarkable performance." 
London Times. 

FRENCH LITERATURE.

English Literature in the University of Dublin. Literatures 

of the World Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" Certainly the best history of French literature in the English lan- 
guage." London Athencewn. 

" This is a history of literature as histories of literature should be 
written. . . . Can be read with pleasure even by those for whom a 
history has in itself little attraction." London Saturday Review. 

ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE. 

By GILBERT MURRAY, M.A., Professor of Greek in the 
University of Glasgow. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
"Professor Murray has written an admirable book, clear in its 
arrangement, compact in its statements, and is one, we think, its least 
scholarly reader must feel an instructive and thoroughly trustworthy 
piece of literary criticism." New York Mail and Express. 

EVOLUTIONAL ETHICS AND ANIMAL 
PSYCHOLOGY. 

By E. P.EVANS, author of " Animal Symbolism in Ecclesias- 
tical Architecture," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 
This book describes the evolution of ethics, or the growth of rules of 
conduct in primitive human societies, particularly with reference to 
man's ideas regarding the lower animals and his treatment of them. 
The first part, on Evolutional Ethics, discusses that conduct of tribal 
society, the influence of religious belief on it in the course of evolution, 
and man's ethical relations to the animals, closing with a chapter on the 
doctrine of metempsychosis. The second part, on Animal Psychology, 
treats of manifestations of mind in the brute as compared with those in 
man, the possibility of progress in the lower animals, their powers of 
ideation, and speech as a barrier between man and beast. On the 
scientific foundation which he thus aims to construct the author bases 
a claim for the recognition of the rights of animals, which he regards 
as subordinate only to the rights of our fellow-men. The book is spiced 
with interesting anecdote, and is exceedingly readable. 

MEMORY AND ITS CULTIVATION. 

By P. W. EDRIDGE- GREEN, M.D., F.R.C.S., author of 
" Colour-Blindness and Colour-Perception," etc. Vol. 78, 
International Scientific Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
Memory is the most important function of the brain ; without it life 
would be a blank. Our knowledge is all based on memory. Every 
thought, every action, our very conception of personal identity, is based 
on memory. Without memory, all experience would be useless ; reason- 
ing would be based on insufficient data, and would be, therefore, falla- 
cious. In this volume the author demonstrates that memory is a definite 
faculty, and has its seat in the basal ganglia of the brain, separate from 
but associated with all the other faculties of the brain. 

A TREATISE ON SURVEYING. 

By WILLIAM M. GILLESPIE, LL.D. Edited by CADT STALET, 
Ph.D., President of the Case School of Applied Science, 
Cleveland, Ohio. New edition, in Two Parts. Part II, 
Higher Surveying. 8vo, cloth, $2.50. 

The volume completing the work includes triangular surveying, 
geodesy, trigonometric leveling, barometric leveling, and precise level- 
ing, topography, field astronomy, hydrographical surveying, mining 
surveying, city surveying, and other special topics. The best authori- 
ties have been consulted in order to render the work as reliable as 
possible. 



THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SUGGESTION. 

A Research into the Subconscious Nature of Man and Society. 
By BORIS Srpis, M.A., Ph.D., Associate in Psychology at 
the Pathological Institute of the New York State Hospitals. 
With an Introduction by Prof. WILLIAM JAMES, of Harvard 
University. Illustrated, 12rao, cloth, $1.75. 
" A fascinating study. ... It handles the subjects of hypnotism, 

double personality, and the subconscious self in an exhaustive and 

scientific, but none the less popular style." New York Herald. 
" A book to make a vivid and lasting impression upon its readers. . . . 

It is in every sense a fascinating work and novel in the extreme." 

Cincinnati Commercial-Tribune. 

VARIOUS FRAGMENTS. 

By HERBERT SPENCER. Large 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
Along with a considerable variety of other matter, these "Frag- 
ments " include a number of replies to criticisms, among which will be 
found some of the best specimens of Mr. Spencer's controversial writ- 
ings, notably his letter to the London Athenceum on Professor Huxley's 
famous address on Evolutionary Ethics. His views on copyright, 
national and international, " Social Evolution and Social Duty," and 
"Anglo-American Arbitration," also form a part of the contents. 

CRUSOE'S ISLAND. 

A Bird-Hunter 1 s Story. A new volume in Appletons' Home- 
Reading Books. By FREDERICK A. OBER, author of 
"Camps in the Caribbees," "Travels in Mexico," etc. 
Illustrated, 12mo, cloth, 65 cts. net. 

In this book the author gives a description of the veritable island in 
which Robinson Crusoe lived his lonely life, the scene of his wreck, his 
cave, his bower, his Man Friday, the birds and trees he saw, or ought 
to have seen, together with a narrative of the author's own experiences 
in the wilds of Tobago; and his life for a time was much like the 
original Crusoe's. It is a book of unusual interest to both old and 
young. 

A PRINCE OF MISCHANCE. 

By T. GALLON, author of " Tatterley." No. 234, Appletons' 
Town and Country Library. 12mo, cloth, $1.00 ; paper, 50c. 
The most blase reader will find it impossible to follow the part which 
the " Prince of Mischance " played in the lives of others without closely 
realizing the originality of the author's attitude toward his work and 
the subtlety of his characterizations. The story is one of to-day, 
although modern realities are invested with a romantic and imaginative 
atmosphere, and the scene passes in an English seashore town, in Lon- 
don, and on the Continent.

LE WIS CARROLL." 

" There is such a thing as nonsense," says 
Walter Bagehot in one of his essays, " and 
when a man has once attained to that deep con- 
ception, you may be sure of him ever after." 
This is no doubt a true saying, but it needs to 
be supplemented. To attain to the conception 
in question is only the beginning of wisdom, for 
there should go with the realization that non- 
sense exists a healthy instinct for its enjoyment 
when it is of the innocuous sort, and for its 
vigorous repudiation when it assumes a perni- 
cious form. There is hi most human nature a 
streak of irrationality which makes people an 
easy mark for certain forms of very dangerous 
nonsense for the pseudo-scientific jargon of 
palmistry or theosophy, let us say and hope- 
less indeed is his case who becomes entrapped 
by these pitfalls. Yet the irrational instincts 
that find such vent belong to the normal psy- 
chological make-up of mankind ; they are sur- 
vivals, probably, although a neo-Schopenhauer- 
ianism might claim for them a deeper cause 
than that, but in any case they have to be reck- 
oned with. Most people chafe, consciously or 
unconsciously, under the limitations of a world 
rigidly subjected to the principle of casuality, 
and seek at times to escape into some world in 
which fancy may rove untrammeled, in which 
life may seem less strenuous than science makes 
it out to be. 

This is a somewhat ponderous exordium for 
a few observations about the work of that gentle 
" maker " of nonsense whose recent death has 
made childhood of all ages the poorer wherever 
the English language is spoken, but it was 
peculiarly the gift of " Lewis Carroll " to open 
our eyes to just such a " land of wonder- 
wander " as we all need to see at times, and 
need all the more in proportion as our habitual 
outlook is uncompromisingly logical and matter- 
of-fact. If we cannot take refuge in some such 
world of transparent impossibilities we are in 
danger of gratifying our deep-seated irrational 
instincts by straying off into delusions of the 
sort that paralyze the powers of thought, of 
confusing vagaries with realities, and of dissi- 
pating our intellectual substance in specula- 
tions that cannot possibly lead to anything ; 
whereas we may give ourselves up to the charm

of Alice and her Wonderland without the least 
compunction, and do not run the slightest dan- 
ger of taking too seriously the doings of the 
Mad Hatter, the March Hare, or the Queen of 
Hearts. If these things are " to the Greeks, 
foolishness," we are sorry for the Greeks, and 
remain unshaken in our loyalty to the imagin- 
ings of the chronicler of Alice, the poet of the 
Boojum and the Jabberwock. 

" A little nonsense now and then 
Is relished by the wisest men," 

so runs the old saw, and to " Lewis Carroll," 
purveyor of the most delightful nonsense in 
our language, a debt of the deepest gratitude 
is due. 

Of that eminent clergyman and distinguished 
mathematician, the Kev. Charles Lutwidge 
Dodgson, the public knows little beyond an 
occasional amusing anecdote, like that which 
relates how the Queen, charmed with the story 
of Alice, requested the author to send her his 
other works, and was not a little surprised when 
she received a collection of mathematical treat- 
He was born about sixty-five years ago, 



ises. 



took his degree at Christ Church, Oxford, and 
remained a college don for the greater part of 
his life. " Alice's Adventures in Wonderland " 
was published in 1865, " Through the Looking- 
Glass" in 1872, and "The Hunting of the 
Snark" in 1876. Among his other books that 
belong to literature, we may mention " Phan- 
tasmagoria," " Doublets," " Rhyme ? and Rea- 
son ? " " Euclid and His Modern Rivals," " A 
Tangled Tale," and " Sylvie and Bruno." The 
three books first mentioned have not only be- 
come classics of the nursery, but have also won 
a place among the books with which every cul- 
tivated reader is expected to have some ac- 
quaintance. Their characters and incidents are 
quoted " to point a moral and adorn a tale " 
almost as frequently as the characters and inci- 
dents that appear in the novels of Dickens or 
the poems of Tennyson. They have added new 
words to the common English vocabulary, and 
people make use of " beamish," and " galumph- 
ing " and " chortling " as of familiar concepts. 
Such verses as " The Walrus and the Carpen- 
ter " and " How doth the little crocodile " are 
as well known as the best lyrics of the more 
serious poets ; while the story of the slaying of 
the Jabberwock rivals in its haunting mystery 
the story of Childe Roland and the Dark Tower, 
besides being rather more intelligible. It is no 
ordinary triumph to have thus imposed a new 
literary genre upon the consciousness of the 
reading public, and the extent of the achieve- 



ment is best realized when we compare the suc- 
cess of " Lewis Carroll " with the comparative 
failure of even the best of his many imitators. 
The books that are concerned with childhood 
may be divided into three classes. The first 
and largest of these classes includes the books 
that are written for children alone, that have 
no message at all for the adult reader. The 
second class includes those few books that state 
things from the childish point of view, but are 
really intended for the delight of children of a 
larger growth. "A Child's Garden of Verses " 
and " The Golden Age " are the two matchless 
examples of this kind of literature. Here we 
have the freshness of feeling that remembers 
what being a child was like, conjoined with an 
exquisite literary art which revives that feeling 
in the grown-up reader, who could not possibly 
summon it back into consciousness unless thus 
aided. But the child, although he may take 
some interest in these books, cannot possibly 
enjoy them as the " Olympians " do. The 
books of the third class, to which belong those 
which we owe to the creator of " Alice," are 
equally appreciated by young and old (although 
of course in different ways), and make for a 
better understanding between the ages, because 
they create a new bond of sympathy, setting 
the child and the man for the time being upon 
a common ground of interest. 



SOME IDEAS ON CRITICISM. 

There is a story of a young lady seated beside 
Tennyson at dinner, and all intent for oracles, who 
was rewarded at last by having the poet remark to 
her, " I like my mutton in hunks." The story is 
not Apropos, but the phrase is apt for my purpose. 
The most of us like our criticism in hunks. Funda- 
mental distinctions, fine discriminations, exquisite 
tests for purity or alloy, these are not for us. 
Rather we like the one-sided, the lop-sided, and the 
factional. We like to have one critic tell us that 
all good literature springs from contemporary life ; 
and another, that character is best studied from the 
outside ; and yet another, that it is useless to kick 
against the pricks of the sordid and vulgar, and that 
majorities count in literature as in elections. Even 
among our brothers across the sea, criticism in hunks 
prevails. Mr. Pater, the subtle and elaborate, had 
eyes only for style. He conceived literature to con- 
sist mainly of phrases. Swathed in his rhetoric, his 
Greek and Italian idols are as indistinguishable as 
the mummies of Egyptian kings. Mr. Buskin has 
been a great maker of critical hunks, and although 
those of his right hand differ from those of his left, 
this does not prove his comprehensiveness. The

total of free, disinterested, comprehensive criticism 
has been, at all times, small. Critical opinion has 
always been in great measure the expression of 
personal feeling, the propaganda of a party, or 
the polemic of a fad. Literature itself is a conflict 
of ideas ; bat the judgment of it ought to have more 
unity than a Donnybrook Fair. 

The born reader, the man who lives in the serene 
air of good literature, rarely, perhaps, writes criti- 
cism. He is like a dog who has found a bone, and 
proceeds to dig a hole and bury it. and then comes 
and looks in your face and wags his tail as though 
to say, " I know where there is a most excellent 
bone, but I am not going to let on." Some of the 
best criticism we have is in the letters of men of 
genius, like Gray and Keats and Fitzgerald and 
Lowell. In their correspondence the minds of these 
men are in undress ease, and judgments that are 
the essence of good taste and good sense come from 
them as naturally as gum oozes from a tree. But 
formal criticism is a necessary thing. If people 
read, they must have opinions, and opinion expressed 
is criticism, and the best informed opinion is good 
criticism. 

The things that are abiding underlie all litera- 
tures ; but the fashions in thought and expression 
change as do the fashions in clothes. The eigh- 
teenth century conceived poetry to be a kind of 
transported prose prose with a ball and chain 
about its ankles ; and it called all its writers, indif- 
ferently, wits. The nineteenth century has tried to 
bring prose and poetry together, by a species of ar- 
terial transfusion, and, in France at least, all imag- 
inative writers are allowed to be poets. Again, the 
first great literary critic, Aristotle, defined poetry 
to be a " making," and in his " Poetics " he ignores 
lyric, satiric, and philosophical poetry. The pen- 
dulum has swung to the other extreme to-day, and 
the lyric is the overwhelmingly dominate form of 
verse. 

Not only the tendencies of that entity we call an 
age, but national peculiarities and prejudices, pre- 
vent a steady assessment of literature. Shakespeare, 
who sank into the German mind like rain on a mel- 
low soil, has always run off from the hard-surfaced 
glittering French intellect. The attitude of England 
to American literature is a case in point. The cul- 
tivated Englishman is an unassuming enough per- 
son within his own gates, but when he goes abroad 
he seems to be possessed with the idea that he wrote 
the plays of Shakespeare with his own hand, and 
paid for building the cathedrals out of his own 
pocket. He comes to or looks at this country, and 
he sees nothing as good as Shakespeare or the 
cathedrals, and he condemns our art in mass. He 
forgets that modern England has nothing so good as 
Shakespeare or the cathedrals either. 

A main cause of critical confusion is our inability 
to get the forms and qualities of literature ranked 
in the order of their importance. Nearly every 
critic has a prepossession for some one quality or 
some one kind of manifestation of genius. Victor 



Hugo, in his great essay on Shakespeare, asserts 
that all masterpieces are equal. The saying is a 
fine one, but must be taken with limitations. When 
Dante begins the ascent of heaven, he is surprised 
to find sphere rising above sphere and order upon 
order of superhuman beings superimposed. He in- 
quires whether there is not, then, equality in heaven, 
and is told, No ; those nearest God absorb most of 
His light, which in turn they emit to those farther 
off. But this, he is assured, does not trouble any- 
one, for " in His will is our peace." Something 
like this may be said of human genius. " Shine, 
poet, in your place, and be content," is Words- 
worth's version of the idea. The great writers are 
modest among their peers. Dante took the sixth 
place in the company of poets ; and Goethe, speak- 
ing of Moliere, said, " It is good for us little men 
to return often to the masters." But readers and 
critics, captivated by some gift that appeals to them 
personally, are always for oversetting the hierarchy 
of genius. We have all our idols of illusion. For 
myself I have such an admiration for the " Hype- 
rion " of Keats that I have to put force on myself 
to keep from calling it the finest piece of verse in 
existence. It is the supreme of outward poetry 
the poetry of form and color and sound. There is 
enough emotion in it to flush its statues with life, 
enough intellect to make them lift their lofty heads 
and utter elemental things. But I know that, com- 
pared with the great world-poems which furnish 
ideals for action and materials for meditation, it is 
an empty thing. Keats never gave better proof of 
his keen critical instinct than in the revised version, 
which, done as it is with an almost utter failure of 
verbal charm, shows an attempt to get humanity 
into the poem. 

If the personality of a critic is a translucent or 
opaque medium for genius to shine through, the 
personality of an author may dim or heighten the 
light he emits. Byron rebels, and draws after him 
the third part of our human hosts ; and admiration 
of his audacity and energy blinds us to his flaws of 
I art. Dante and Milton stand in mighty isolation, 
attractive to us as the magnetic mountain was to 
Sinbad's ship. When we study them we feel that 
to walk erect it is necessary to walk aloof. Their 
characters intensify their poetry as Shakespeare's 
and Goethe's do not. 

Perhaps Lessing comes nearest to the ideal critic 
of all who have ever officiated Minos-wise. Yet 
even he coils his tail around him nine times, and 
Racine and Boileau are consigned to the lowest pit. 
Aristotle, as I have said, seems to have been indif- 
ferent to the individual element in genius. Coming 
down to modern times, Sainte-Beuve was so much 
interested in the characters of his authors that he 
forgot to assess their talents. Every French soldier 
may carry a marshal's baton in his knapsack, but 
surely every French author has not immortality 
hidden in his baggage. When Nature or Fate for- 
got this present, Sainte-Beuve often slipped it in, as 
Joseph did the silver cup into Benjamin's sack.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



Besides, the French delight in lucidity and elegance 
is too strong in him. He can appreciate grace, but 
is half afraid of greatness. When he describes the 
Greek and Latin and French authors assembled in 
the Temple of Fame, he merely adds, " Shakes- 
peare is there." The great creative outburst in En- 
gland at the beginning of this century was paralleled 
by an equal critical activity. Whether the last had 
anything to do with producing the first, or whether, 
" as a gate of bronze, fronting the sun, receives and 
renders back its figure and its heat," it was merely 
secondary, it certainly betrays the same tendencies. 
The canons of an earlier age were torn to shreds, 
and imagination warred against common sense. 

As the earth revolves about its axis in one direc- 
tion, and moves around the sun in a second, and 
is carried with the solar system in a third, and has 
perhaps a multiplication of other movements, until 
the mind is appalled and wonders if there be direc- 
tion or motion at all, so literature has its cross 
and contradictory revolutions and processions, and 
criticism is caught with them, like flotsam on cur- 
rent and eddy, and cannot stand aside on some 
serene spot of contemplation and comprehend the 
whole. 

Popular American criticism has always demanded 
two things : That our authors should paint from 
life, and that they should deal with American sub- 
jects. If, instead of the first requirement, an author 
should be made to write about what he knows best, 
there might be something to say for it. A poet may 
very easily be more familiar with fairies and god- 
desses than with people of flesh and blood, and he 
had best stick to his acquaintance. Or, a scholar 
may be so saturated with the past as to be unable to 
see the present. It is remarkable that every great 
period of English literature has been fecundated, as 
it were, by pollen blown from some remote time or 
removed place. In the Elizabethan epoch, it was the 
Italian influence which enriched and impregnated 
the native stock. In Dryden's time, the literature 
of France did the same work ; and the Georgian 
bloom and fruitage was largely caused by ideas 
brought from Germany and forms revived from 
Greece. As to the supposed necessity for American 
writers to deal with American subjects, it may be 
remarked that the authors of no other countries 
have been so restricted. None of Shakespeare's 
themes are contemporary, and few are English. 
Milton is antique or antediluvian. In this respect 
a distinction must be made between the different 
forms of literature. The lyric is purely personal, 
and hardly needs location. Satire must be contem- 
porary and local, or it does not exist. There is no 
use in our satirizing Nero or the Emperor of China. 
Comedy, too, is mainly an affair of locality ; though 
Shakespeare's imaginative comedy the enchanted 
playground of the world is bound by no real 
limits of time or space. Ideal poetry in its greatest 
efforts of tragedy or epic instinctively seeks remote- 
ness. Mountains can only be seen at a distance, 
and though genius can do much, even genius must 



find it hard to draw from the near and common 
faces and forms about it the lineaments and limbs 
of those tragic personages who resume into them- 
selves an epoch or embody universal humanity. 
Dante, indeed, took the names and suggestions of 
his own time and country, and turned them to great 
account ; but he first dipped them in Styx and sur- 
rounded them with the scenery and machinery of the 
other world. A man of genius is like a tree which 
must be rooted in the ground, but draws the greater 
part of its subsistence from the air which is world- 
wide and the sun which is universal. 

Changes of taste, vicissitudes of opinion, oblivions 
and revivals, these, every work of art must endure. 
Time is the true judge ; and in the nature of things 
Time is never final. On the walls of Karnak there 
is sculptured a long procession of forms the Egyp- 
tian judgment-givers, the Forty-two Assessors of 
the Dead. This cold scrutinizing line is no bad 
emblem of what awaits those who aspire to be among 
the Princes of Posterity. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

SOME OF ARNOLD'S QUALITIES AS A CRITIC. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The opening article of your journal for January 16 
characterizes Matthew Arnold as " on the whole the 
truest and finest English critic of our generation." I 
am inclined to agree with this estimate, and would like 
to add a suggestion or two as to the qualities on which 
such a claim should rest. 

The style of Arnold has frequently been called high- 
bred. This means, first of all, that he is perfectly simple 
and sincere ; secondly, it means that he endeavors never 
to intrude himself upon his subject; and thirdly, that he 
instinctively seeks whatever is excellent and true in the 
person with whom he is dealing. Exceptions to these 
statements there undoubtedly are, yet I believe they will 
prove the rule. 

When we turn, however, from style to matter, we find 
a good deal to object to. Even the excellent essay on 
Keats is now a trifle obsolete because the thesis of that 
essay has been set forth in a more scholarly way by 
Mr. Sidney Colvin; and the charming essay on Gray is 
almost valueless because of the author's inadequate 
knowledge of Gray's character. The truth is that Arnold 
was too hard-worked, as an inspector of schools, to allow 
one of his mental breadth to perfect himself in the many 
subjects in which he could not but interest himself. He 
was, too, as much an observer of men and manners as 
of books; and in dealing with books he is almost the 
supreme critic of literary manner. 

I believe that Arnold is found at his best in subjects 
requiring little or no scholarship, in subjects where the 
high breeding of his style is all-sufficient. An example 
is found in his felicitous manner of introducing to the 
public authors whose literary work is small in volume 
and little known. Joubert, Maurice de Gudrin, and 
Marcus Aurelius will, let us hope, never be dragged 
into the scuffling-ground of literary scholars. They did 
not in their writings make a bid for fame, and we like

to treat them as gentlemen. To hare known them is 
of inestimable value; yet Gue'rin, at least, would be 
almost unknown to English readers but for the excellent 
essay of Mr. Arnold. The Journal Intime contains pas- 
sages of unsurpassed poetic prose; and it is thanks to 
Arnold's essay that they will find fit audience among 
the Anglo-Saxon race. Even those who content them- 
selves with the essay itself will derive exquisite pleasure 
from the charming translations it embodies. An En- 
glish translation of the whole Journal exists, but I have 
not seen it, and am unable to speak of its claims on the 
attention of English readers.

SHAKESPEARIAN PLAYS ACTED BY 

COLLEGE MEN. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

It is, of course, only a coincidence that about the 
time when Professor Brander Matthews in Philadelphia 
as reported in the last issue of THE DIAL was 
urging upon teachers of literature the importance of 
observing, in the criticism of dramatic writing, the 
stage conditions under which alone the real drama can 
be successful, the students of a Western college were 
putting on the boards, under the direction of the Pro- 
fessor of English, a Shakespearian comedy. And yet 
it is a coincidence rich in suggestion. Perhaps we have 
in the recent performance of " Much Ado About Noth- 
ing " by the students of Indiana University a hint of 
one of the methods by which the contention of Mr. 
Matthews may be applied in a practical way to college 
classes, and our academic study of the drama thereby 
rendered more exact and complete. The accurate re- 
production of a Shakespearian play, for instance, on the 
historical Shakespearian stage, will go far toward giving 
a college audience a definite understanding of the play 
itself, as well as contributing to their appreciation of its 
purely dramatic qualities. At any rate, the benefits to 
be derived by the student who takes part in such a per- 
formance are evident to the most casual observer ; be- 
sides learning directly and by experience something of 
the conditions which satisfy the demands of the stage, 
he is saved from the mistake of regarding the drama as 
only a phase of literature. 

The value of such revivals by college people, in cul- 
tivating among them, better than the formal routine of 
the class-room can do, a taste for the best plays and a 
demand for good acting, is surely not insignificant; par- 
ticularly when one takes into consideration the fact that 
under present conditions most college communities are 
deprived of all opportunity to see good plays well acted. 
The more hopeful of us may even imagine that we have 
here at baud a potent means for bringing about the long- 
desired " elevation of the stage " and the consequent 
removal of the lingering prejudice against the theatre 
among many good people. The student of English 
literary history is reminded of the sturdy impulse given 
to the drama in the early days of Elizabeth through the 
frequent presentation of plays by the Universities and 
Inns of Court: is he likely to be counted too enthusiastic 
if he venture fondly to hope that through such academic 
performances in our own day, once they become general, 
there may be stimulated a revival of dramatic literature 
of serious proportions and artistic completeness ?

AN INTERESTING AND IMPUDENT BIT 

OF PLAGIARISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The publication of the second volume of " The French 
Revolution," by Mr. Justin H. McCarthy, M.P. (son of 
the leader of the Irish party in Parliament and the author 
of " A History of our Own Times "), recalls an interest- 
ing plagiarism in his first volume. In treating the im- 
portant subject, " Taxation," he takes bodily from Mrs. 
Gardiner's excellent little work, " The French Revolu- 
tion," one of the " Epochs of Modern History " series, 
and gives no credit therefor. I subjoin the passages 
referred to. 



MBS. GAKDUJKE, PP. 9-10. 
"Some provinces and towns 
were privileged in relation to cer- 
tain taxes, and as a rule it was the 
poorest provinces on which the 
heaviest burdens lay. One of the 
most iniquitous of the taxes was 
the gabelle, or tax on salt. Of this 
tax, which was farmed, two-thirds 
of the whole were levied on a third 
of the kingdom. The price varied 
so much that the same measure 
which cost a few shillings in one 
province cost two or three pounds 
in another. The farmers of the 
tax had behind them a small army 
of officials for the suppression of 
smuggling, as well as special 
courts for the punishment of those 
who disobeyed fiscal regulations. 
These regulations were minute 
and vexatious in the extreme. 
Throughout the north and centre 
of France, the gabelle was in real- 
ity a poll tax ; the sale of salt was 
a monopoly in the hands of the 
farmers ; no one might use other 
salt than that sold by them, and it 
was obligatory on every person 
aged above seven years to pur- 
chase seven pounds yearly. This 
salt, however, of which the pur- 
chase was obligatory might only be 
used for purely cooking purposes. 
If the farmer wished to salt his 
pig, or the fisherman his fish, they 
must buy additional salt and ob- 
tain a certificate that such pur- 
chase had been made. Thousands 
of persons, either for inability to 
pay the tax or for attempting to 
evade the laws of the farm, were 
yearly fined, imprisoned, sent to 
the galleys, or hanged. The chief 
of the property taxes, the faille, 
inflicted as much suffering as the 
gabelle, and was also ruinous to 
agriculture. Over two-thirds of 
France the faille was a tax on 
lands, houses, and industry reas- 
sessed every year, not according to 
any fixed rate, but according to 
the presumed capacity of the prov- 
ince, the parish and the individual 
taxpayers. The consequence was 
that, on the smallest indication of 
prosperity, the amount of the tax 
was raised, and thus parish after 
parish and farmer after farmer 
were reduced to the same dead 
level of indigence." 



MB. McCAETHT.voL. L, pp. 306-306. 
"Some provinces and towns 
were privileged in relation to cer- 
tain taxes, and as a rule it was 
the poorest provinces on which 
the heaviest burdens lay. One of 
the most evil of the taxes was the 
gabelle, or tax on salt, which, as 
we shall see, aroused the indigna- 
tion of Arthur Young. Of this tax, 
which was farmed, two-thirds of 
the whole were levied on a third of 
the kingdom. There were special 
courts for the punishment of those 
who disobeyed fiscal regulations of 
the most minute and grotesque 
kind. Throughout the north and 
centre of France the gabelle was in 
reality a poll tax. The sale of salt 
was a monopoly in the hands of 
the farmers, who had behind them 
a small army of officials for the 
suppression of smuggling, or using 
other salt than that sold by them. 
Every person aged above seven 
years was forced to purchase seven 
pounds yearly, though the price 
varied so much that the same 
measure which cost a few shillings 
in one province cost two or three 
pounds in another. Yet this salt 
might be used for cooking pur- 
poses, and cooking purposes alone. 
The fisherman who wished to salt 
his catch, the farmer who wished 
to salt his pork, must buy more 
salt and obtain a certificate that 
they had bought more salt. The ex- 
chequers were swollen, the galleys 
were manned, the gallows were 
weighted yearly with the fines of 
purse or of person paid by the vic- 
tims of this odious tax. But the 
gabelle was not the only infliction. 
There was the faille, the first of 
the property taxes, the faille that 
was as cruel as the gabelle, and as 
fatal to agriculture. It was fan- 
tastically reassessed every year, 
not according to any regular eco- 
nomic rule, but according to that 
more Oriental plan which varies 
its taxation with the varying for- 
tunes of the place or person taxed. 
The over-taxed victims soon dis- 
covered that the smallest indica- 
tion of prosperity meant an in- 
crease in the amount of the tax. 
Under its blight farmer after 
farmer and parish after parish 
were degraded to a common ruin 



and a common despair." 
Considering the large celebrity of the name of 
McCarthy and the wide circulation of Mrs. Gardiner's 
book (published on both sides of the Atlantic), the 
parallel illustrates a piece of cool impudence, to say the 
least. M. O. T.

AUDUBON'S STORY HE-TOLD.* 



It is nearly fifty years since John James 
Audubon passed from the sight of men, yet his 
name is fresh in every mind. It is as yester- 
day that the modest biography published in 
1869 gave us an outline of the leading facts in 
his history. The record was of a fascinating 
character, unique in many particulars, strongly 
tinged with romance, and vivid in its suggest- 
iveness. It set forth so remarkable a person- 
ality, at once charming and commanding, that 
one could not fail to retain the impression and 
be glad to revive it at any hour. When, there- 
fore, a more complete account of the man is 
now presented, chiefly through his journals set 
in order by his granddaughter, the pleasure is 
heightened by the interest of the facts already 
known ; and as the final page is reached in this 
last full and authentic narrative, in an access of 
enthusiasm one is impelled to turn back to the 
earlier volume, and hunt it through, as so often 
before, for material to feed the reawakened 
interest. It is not so much the genius of 
Audubon, his gifts and accomplishments, that 
delight us : it is, first of all, his manliness, the 
rare balance of sweetness and strength, of dar- 
ing and humility, of impetuosity and patience, 
of grace and virility, of passion and purity, of 
fidelity, industry, and endurance, in a word, 
of the masculine and feminine elements which 
together make up the perfect humanity. 

It would be superfluous to rehearse any but 
the most significant incidents of Audubon's 
career. Everybody is familiar with the chance 
which procured his birth on American soil, 
the gay, roving Frenchman, Admiral Audubon, 
having married a beautiful Spanish Creole and 
become a temporary resident in the vicinity of 
New Orleans. The mother did not long sur- 
vive the advent of her son, and the day and 
year of his arrival were afterward lost in ob- 
livion. They may be placed, according to his 
granddaughter, somewhere not far beyond 
1772. The formative years of Audubon's life 
were spent in France, where every privilege 
was afforded him which wealth, a doting step- 
mother, and a prudent father could provide. 
" The handsomest boy in France," as the step- 
mother declared, was trained in all the graceful 
arts befitting a gentleman of his time. He

danced and fenced and drew, and played the 
flute and violin and flageolet with unusual skill, 
displaying in every direction both versatile and 
masterful talents. An absorbing love for na- 
ture in all its phases was his dominant charac- 
teristic, and in early childhood he began paint- 
ing the birds about him, a pursuit from which 
finally he was to earn lasting fame. He had 
already made two hundred sketches of these 
feathered wonders, when, at seventeen years of 
age, he returned to America, to become an 
independent citizen of the country to which he 
was ever loyally attached. 

For some years his home was at Mill Grove, 
a farm belonging to his father, situated near 
Schuylkill Falls in Pennsylvania. Here he led 
a life devoid of care and devoted to pleasures 
of a harmless sort, in which music and drawing 
were not neglected. He had no vices. Later 
in life, he wrote : 

" Cards I disliked. ... I lived on milk, fruits, and 
vegetables, with the addition of game and fish at times, 
but never had I swallowed a single glass of wine or 
spirits until the day of my wedding. The result has 
been my uncommon, indeed iron, constitution. This has 
been my constant mode of life ever since my earliest 
recollection. ... I never went to dinners, merely be- 
cause my choice of food occasioned comment, and also 
because often not a single dish was to my taste, and I 
could eat nothing from the sumptuous tables before me. 
. . . All this time I was as fair and as rosy as a girl, 
though as strong, indeed stronger than most young men, 
and as active as a buck." 

Audubon was a model of manly beauty, with 
a lithe, sinewy frame, capable of wonderful 
feats of strength and endurance, and a counte- 
nance marked by a pair of large, beaming eyes, 
a noble forehead, long locks of curling hair 
falling to the shoulders, and an expression of 
singular energy and intelligence. In his indif- 
ference to society, he permitted his future wife 
to dwell for months on an adjoining estate be- 
fore he discovered her proximity. At the first 
interview he was aware of his mistake. Lucy 
Bakewell was a woman of solid attainments, 
gained in the English home from which she 
had lately removed, and of the stanch qualities 
needed in the wife of Audubon. He was an 
ardent lover, but the young girl's father advised 
him to make some study of business before 
assuming the responsibilities of a family. He 
therefore turned to the mercantile trade, in 
which his experiences were such as might be 
anticipated of an untamable genius whose 
inclinations were averse to bartering in goods 
and accumulating pelf. He was married in 
1808, and immediately departed for Louisville, 
Ky., with the intent to lead the staid life of a 



1898.]

merchant and a Benedict. How he pursued 
that intent we read in his own artless confession 
that, engrossed in the study of birds, he never 
thought of business beyond " the ever-engaging 
journeys" for the purchase of goods, which 
took him through " the beautiful, the darling 
forests " of the country lying between Louisville 
and New York City. He writes : 

" Were I to tell you that once, when travelling and 
driving several horses before me laden with goods and 
dollars, I lost sight of the pack-saddles, and the cash 
they bore, to watch the motions of a warbler, I should 
only repeat occurrences that happened a hundred times 
and more in those days." 

Two years in Louisville were followed by a 
brief venture in Henderson, and a later attempt 
to build up a trade at St. Genevieve, all of 
which were fruitful chiefly in depleting his for- 
tune. In 1811 his business relations with his 
partner were dissolved, Audubon declaring that 
" Rozier cared only for money and liked St. 
Genevieve "; and Rozier writing, " Audubon 
had no taste for commerce, and was continually 
in the forest." 

The succeeding seventeen years comprised a 
period of trying vicissitudes in the experience 
of the Audubons. The wife, always patient 
and faithful, gave unreserved sympathy to the 
wandering proclivities of her husband, and 
while his plan for the production of his great 
work delineating " The Birds of America " was 
taking shape, she lent him every possible en- 
couragement. She bore the long terms of 
separation necessary to his purpose without 
complaint, meanwhile caring for their two sons, 
and contributing largely toward the family 
maintenance by teaching, which at that early 
day was a fertile source of revenue in the South. 
Audubon was often without a dollar in his 
pocket, yet when reduced to the severest straits 
he was able easily to coin money out of his 
varied accomplishments, now drawing portraits 
in chalk at five dollars a head, and now giving 
dancing lessons which in a few winter months 
could be made to yield two thousand dollars. 
Like Agassiz, he could not afford to stop his 
life-work for mere money-making. " One of 
the most extraordinary things in all these ad- 
verse circumstances," he states, " was that I 
never for a day gave up listening to the songs 
of our birds, or watching their peculiar habits, 
or delineating them in the best way that I 
could." One hour of sad despondency he de- 
scribes as " the only time in my life when the 
wild turkeys that so often crossed my path, and 
the thousands of lesser birds that enlivened the 
woods and the prairies, all looked like enemies, 



and I turned my eyes from them, as if I could 
have wished that they had never existed." 

In 1826 he visited Philadelphia with his 
portfolio of pictures, desirous of taking a few 
lessons of Peale or of Sully, that he might im- 
prove in his beloved art, and also to devise ways 
of bringing his work before the public. Here, 
his scanty means being soon exhausted, he re- 
sorted anew to his pencil for help, and writes, 
July 19 : 

" Young Harris, God bless him, looked at the draw- 
ings I had for sale, and said he would take them all, at 
my prices. I would have kissed him, but that is not 
the custom in this icy city." 

Finding that his *' Birds of America " could 
not be properly lithographed in this country, 
he devoted the next two years to the enlarge- 
ment of his collection, and the gathering of a 
little fund that might enable him to visit En- 
gland. With a " God speed " from his wife, 
and a stout heart in his breast, he set out on 
his doubtful enterprise from New Orleans, 
April 26, 1826, and landed in Liverpool July 
21. He had an extraordinary gift for making 
friends, and everyone was attracted by the 
simple manners and prepossessing mien of this 
talented, unsophisticated " man of the woods." 

In his various absences from home, Audubon 
was in the habit of committing to a journal the 
incidents of each day for the perusal of the 
loved ones left behind. His heart was laid 
bare in these pages, and very interesting it is 
to view the intense emotions that excited him 
as he strove to enlist sympathy and aid in the 
costly endeavor on which he was now intent. 
Alternate hopes and fears rioted in his breast. 
Of the first exhibition of his pictures before a 
prospective patron, he writes : 

" What sensations I had whilst I helped to untie the 
fastenings of my portfolio ! I knew by all around me 
that these good friends were possessed of both taste and 
judgment, and I did not know that I should please. I 
was panting like the winged pheasant, but ah ! these 
kind people praised my birds, and I felt the praise to be 
honest; once more I breathed freely. . . . Oh ! what 
can I hope, my Lucy, for thee and for us all ? " 

So great was his encouragement that in two 
weeks' time he cheerily announced : 

" I am well received everywhere, my works praised 
and admired, and my poor heart is at last relieved from 
the great anxiety that has for so many years agitated 
it, for I know now that I have not worked in vain." 

Still there was ever-recurring suspense for the 
shy, humble artist to endure, as he presented 
his work to the eye of each possible subscriber. 
On his way to Lizars, the skilled engraver who 
was to pass judgment on his art, he says : 
** I lost hope at every step, and I doubt if I opened 



72

my lips. I slowly unbuckled my portfolio, placed a 
chair for him, and with my heart like a stone held up a 
drawing. Mr. Lizars rose from his seat, exclaiming : 
My God ! I never saw anything like this before.' " 

For two years Andubon was carrying his 
portfolio from city to city in England, Scot- 
land, and France, and from the presence of 
one rich man's door to another, to gather names 
enough on his list to sustain the costly publica- 
tion of his " Birds of America." It was the 
largest and most expensive work of the sort 
that had ever been undertaken, and only Au- 
dubon's enthusiasm and tenacity of purpose 
could have conceived and carried through the 
immense achievement. When he returned to 
America he had secured a hundred and forty- 
four subscribers, and the work was far advanced 
in the process of printing. It was published 
in parts of five plates each (" elephant folio " 
in size), at two guineas a part ; and, when com- 
pleted, comprised eighty-seven parts, giving 
506 species and 1065 figures of birds. About 
one hundred and seventy-five copies are now 
known to be in existence, eighty of which are 
in America. It is one of the few illustrated 
works, if not the only one, an eminent orni- 
thologist has said, which steadily increases in 
price with the passage of time. The rare copies 
now occasionally thrown on the market com- 
mand from $1500 to $2000. The cost of 
printing the work was over $100,000. 

While managing the details of this large 
enterprise, Audubon was obliged to use the 
utmost diligence to keep himself and his print- 
ers in funds. He found a quick sale for single 
drawings at remunerative prices, and it was no 
unusual occurrence for him to sit painting four- 
teen or even seventeen hours on a stretch. Four 
hours of sleep sufficed him, and he loved to be 
up and out for a long tramp, or settled to his 
day's labor, at three o'clock in the morning. 
It was hard to adapt himself to the habits of 
ordinary men, and he was restive and misera- 
ble in the gatherings where all eyes were sure 
to be riveted upon his striking person. His 
English friends besought him to have his hair 
cut and to put on a fashionable coat before he 
appeared in London. After one such earnest 
solicitation, he remarks, " I laughed, and he 
laughed, and my hair is yet as God made it." 
The importunity was urgent, however, and 
finally yielding to it,' he thus noted the event in 
a black-bordered page of his journal : 

" March 19, 1827 This day my hair was sacrificed. 
... As the barber clipped my locks rapidly, it reminded 
me of the horrible French Revolution, when the same 
operation was performed upon all the victims murdered 



at the guillotine; my heart sank low. ... I knew I 
was acting weakly, but, rather than render my good 
friend miserable about it, I suffered the loss patiently." 

Audubon had been fond of dress and of lux- 
urious belongings in his youth, but all that was 
far in the past. It had been crowded out of 
his thought by more noble and absorbing aspi- 
rations ; and to renew the lost interest was 
not now possible. " No dash, no glimmer or 
shine about him," was the comment of Sir 
Walter Scott, "but great simplicity of man- 
ners and behavior, slight in person and plainly 
dressed." 

The returns from the " Birds of America," 
and later publications of a similar nature, en- 
sured Audubon a competence for his remaining 
years. He purchased a tract of twenty-four 
acres on the banks of the Hudson, now known 
as Audubon Park, within the present limits of 
New York City. Here, with wife, children, 
and grandchildren, in one happy household, 
his old age was supremely blessed. His indus- 
try continued undiminished, his study of the 
birds, to which were now added the quadrupeds, 
his rambles in the forests, his delightful com- 
panionship with Nature. In 1833 three months 
were consumed in a trip to Labrador, and in 
1843 he gave eight months to an investigation 
of the wild life in the forests bordering the 
Missouri. A venerable man at this latter date, 
he was still in possession of astonishing phy- 
sical powers. In his prime he had once said 
that, in a walking match, " I think I could kill 
any horse in England in twenty days, taking 
the travel over rough and level ground." Until 
the last, his form was erect, his step like that 
of a deer, and his eye as keen as an Indian's. 
It is said by his sole surviving comrade of the 
tour to Labrador : 

" You had only to meet him to love him, and when 
you had conversed with him for a moment, you looked 
upon him as an old friend, rather than a stranger. . . . 
To this day I can see him, a magnificent gray-haired 
man, child-like in his simplicity, kind-hearted, noble- 
souled, lover of nature and lover of youth, friend of 
humanity, and one whose religion was the golden rule." 

A monument in old Trinity churchyard, 
New York, marks the spot where Audubon was 
buried. These two generous volumes of his 
journals, enriched by ten portraits of himself, 
with others of his wife and sons, and various 
miscellaneous engravings, give him back to us 
as he was in life, an honor to his country and 
his race. Dr. Elliott Coues has added to the 
scientific value of the present book by an abund- 
ance of painstaking and scholarly notes.

IN OL.D VIRGINIA.* 

The commonwealth of Virginia is fall of 
fascination for the historian of every type. 
The old aristocracy of its youth has now been 
replaced by the new democracy of its present 
maturity. Mr. Bradley's " Sketches from Old 
Virginia " are snap-shots of the transition pe- 
riod the first fifteen years after the close of 
the Civil War (1861-65). He gives us ten 
little pictures, not always connected in thought, 
but all snatched from that memorable period, 
when the old conditions were present in mem- 
ory only, and the new in reality. " Parkin the 
Saddler," "On the Old Bethel Pike," and 
" The ' Poor Whites ' of the Mountains," espe- 
cially, open the door into revelations of the old 
and the new, the past and the present. Told 
in a simple and often pathetic manner, the 
stories appeal to and take hold of the reader. 
They possess the reality which grows out of a 
personal acquaintance with, and knowledge of, 
the conditions described. Every such book 
adds to our mental picture of those stirring 
days, and, though not always written ideally, 
it should be made welcome by all lovers of 
history. 

Professor Fiske has produced the book of 
the year 1897 on American history. " Old 
Virginia and Her Neighbors" falls into its 
place in his well-planned series. These vol- 
umes fill the gap between his " Discovery of 
America " and "Beginnings of New England." 
They take up the story of Virginia with Sir 
Walter Kaleigh and the Rev. Richard Hakluyt, 
and follow it " until the year 1753, when the 
youthful George Washington sets forth upon 
his expedition to warn the approaching French- 
men from any further encroachments upon En- 
glish soil." The subsequent history of Virginia, 
beginning with the war of the Spanish Succes- 
sion which broke out during Nicholson's rule 
in Virginia, in 1753, remain to be treated in a 
later work. 

Raleigh's Virginia, extending from Florida 
to Canada, standing between France and Spain, 
first receives careful consideration from Mr. 
Fiske. The first charter of Virginia, issued by 
James I. in 1606, limited Virginia within the 
34th and 45th parallels of latitude and from 
the seashore a hundred miles inland. Three 
years thereafter, as if to cut off all dispute re-

garding the western wilderness, a second char- 
ter describes Virginia as extending " from sea 
to sea" (Vol. I., p. 60). It is supposed that 
the King thought of the two limits " 100 
miles inland " and " from sea to sea " as prac- 
tically one and the same. This Virginia, cut 
into three zones, was open for colonization by 
two joint-stock companies with headquarters in 
London. In 1609 (Vol. I., p. 145) Virginia 
proper was cut off from North Virginia, which 
soon took the names of New England and New 
Netherlands, and was colonized by Puritans 
and Dutchmen. 

This remaining Virginia suffered further re- 
duction in 1632 when Maryland was carved 
from her north side, and in 1663 and in 1732 
when other slices were cut off to form Carolina 
and Georgia respectively. The author limits 
his account of Maryland to 107 pages, and of 
the Carolinas to 67 pages. Thus with a firm 
hand he holds himself closely to the discussion 
of Virginia proper. 

The author's method is next to ideal. He 
endeavors " to follow the main stream of causa- 
tion from the time of Raleigh to the time of 
Dinwiddie, from its sources down to its absorp- 
tion into a mightier stream." This plan gives 
the narrative a movement, a life, which is very 
attractive and engaging to the reader. It re- 
veals a large amount of careful sifting on the 
part of the author, so that only the essential, 
the vital, facts may find place in his work. The 
temptation to lug in side-issues or striking 
details is firmly resisted. Professor Fiske's 
breadth and discernment are apparent on every 
page. His survey of events penetrates at once 
to the underlying currents, and so locates them 
as to define the fixed relations of the events. 

It is a relief to all who delight in the ro- 
mantic of American history to see that the 
authenticity of the story of Captain John Smith 
and Pocahontas is critically defended by Pro- 
fessor Fiske. Some of the breeziest reading, 
especially for the boys, in these two volumes 
will be found in the chapter which opens Vol- 
ume I., on " The Sea Kings "; also, "A Sem- 
inary of Sedition " (Vol. I., p. 191 ff.), and 
" The Golden Age of Pirates " (Vol. II., p. 338 
ff.). The directness of the author's style and 
his clearness of statement one always under- 
stands him set before one a vivid word- 
picture, such as many another writer could not 
do with twice the space. The whole work is 
admirably done, revealing at once a command- 
ing knowledge of the situations, a power of 
analysis equal to every emergency, and a genius

in grouping causes and effects. This is now 
our star work on the period of Old Virginia. 

The volumes are illustrated with a half dozen 
good maps of those Virginia days. And the 
printer's art is very creditable. These living 
records arouse our avidity for their successors, 
soon to follow, on "The Dutch and Quaker 
Colonies." IBA M. PRICE. 



THE HOPE OF THE LABORING MAN.* 

The pleasing assumption that by legislative 
process we can give to the poor a greater share 
of the produce of capital and labor, while not 
diminishing the aggregate production, ought to 
reveal its inherent absurdity in the mere state- 
ment. Nevertheless, the belief that this can 
be done is very prevalent. It is Mr. Means's 
object, in his work on " Industrial Freedom," 
to show that no taxation of capital, no legisla- 
tion compelling a new division of the shares of 
labor and capital, no socialistic device, can 
accomplish the end desired. These attempts 
can only diminish the total from which both 
profit and wages are paid, and so inflict further 
injury upon the laborer. 

A grievance does indeed exist. Everyone 
admits that the majority of mankind must re- 
main obscure, poor, and without the great means 
of development and culture. Yet, while this 
is true, the material condition of such men is so 
infinitely better than it was a hundred years 
ago, and their eyes have been so opened to the 
possibilities of this life, its opportunities for 
development, its ease and comforts, so much 
the more desirable when unpossessed, that a 
feeling of revolt is almost universal. This 
feeling is intensified by what seems to be the 
injustice of their lot. Hence the demand that 
the injustice shall be rectified by law ; that the 
rich shall give of their fulness to the poor, and 
that by a new arrangement of the social system 
all men may enjoy the blessings and rewards 
of material prosperity. 

But what is this injustice ? Certainly, if the 
conditions complained of are due to natural 
means, and not to the acts of men, we cannot 
speak of any injustice which has a possible 
meaning in this connection. The injustice 
complained of must be the remediable injustice 
of man to man. If such exists, then it is, in- 
deed, the duty of the legislator to correct it.

So much is willingly admitted. But let no man 
out of the depth of his bitterness accuse the 
social system because there is a necessary strug- 
gle for existence ; or because natural conditions 
are hostile to the physically and mentally weak ; 
or because machinery and inventions have dis- 
turbed the temporary organization of the in- 
dustrial world for its lasting benefit ; or because 
many laboring men are improvident; or because 
the earth is so constituted that the means of 
subsistence have a tendency to increase in a 
different ratio to the increase of population. 
If these things are injustices, there is an end 
to the argument, and the laboring man is more 
than vindicated in his rebellion. 

Conceding that these conditions are neces- 
sary, we are confined to an inquiry into the ac- 
tual relations between employer and employed, 
an inquiry which has for its object the deter- 
mination of the province of legislative inter- 
ference between the two. What is the actual 
status? It is presumably one of free, open, 
and complete competition, with the power on 
both sides of making contracts. This being 
the case, the advocate of legislative interference 
declares that the laboring man is a slave, and 
his condition that of "industrial slavery." The 
truth is not in accordance with this assertion. 
In the matter of law, for instance, the employed 
is less a slave than the employer, for the law 
permits workingmen to combine to raise wages, 
while it prohibits capitalists from combining 
to raise prices ; the workingman can break his 
contract with impunity, while the law will hold 
the employer to the strict letter of the same 
contract. Nor is the position of the laborer 
harsher in other respects. Capital can as little 
afford to lie idle as can labor. In fact, it 
sometimes cannot so well afford this, since the 
loss to capital is not only the loss of profit, but 
of rent and interest as well, a loss on the 
machinery and buildings which are lying idle. 
Moreover, the capitalist may have contracts 
which he is bound under heavy penalties to fill. 
In such a case, he is at the mercy of the work- 
ingman. At the best, he is often compelled to 
pay wages which are above the rate that would 
be paid if competition were indeed free and 
open, for a strong trades-union will have con- 
siderable power to raise wages, and even greater 
power in hindering the capitalist from hiring 
non-union men. 

It has been held that the relations existing 
between employer and employed are materially 
changed when a corporation is the employer. 
But there is no good ground for this assertion.

Competition still exists, and has to be taken 
into account. Much as the corporation might 
like to secure its labor for half price, it cannot 
do so, but must pay for it what other competi- 
tors engaged in the same industry pay ; just as 
it must pay equal prices for the lumber and 
coal and iron that it buys. It has no choice, 
and to speak of industrial slavery in such a 
case is nonsense. Isolated instances of reduced 
wages will occur, but they cannot last, for the 
tendency on the one hand is to cut down all 
expenses, on the other hand to compel a rise 
in wages. Hence other corporations will try 
to reduce wages, while the laborers will strive 
for an advance which will make their wages 
equal to those of other workers in the same 
industry. Consequently wages are bound to 
reach a common level. 

Notwithstanding these facts, it is particularly 
upon corporations that war is waged ; it is upon 
them that many people feel there lies the duty 
of raising wages ; of being forced by law to "dis- 
gorge." The injustice of these demands is ap- 
parent, and becomes even more apparent when 
we examine into the real nature of a corpora- 
tion. A corporation consists of a body of 
stockholders and their agents, the officials who 
manage its affairs ; the acts of a corporation 
are the acts either of the stockholders or of the 
agents ; the property of a corporation is un- 
doubtedly that of the stockholders ; the " crimes " 
of a corporation are the " crimes " of its agents ; 
the " disgorging " demanded must be done by 
the stockholders ; if the corporation must pay 
higher wages, these must come from the same 
source. And who are the stockholders? In 
thousands of cases they are men of moderate 
means. Stock is often held by charitable in- 
stitutions, or by widows and orphans who can- 
not manage their own property, and so invest 
it in corporate stock. When we have stated 
these simple and well-known facts, the injustice 
of the demand that corporations should pay 
higher wages and have fewer rights than other 
employers becomes evident. And when we 
examine statistics it is found that the stock- 
holders rarely receive large profits. Many of 
them receive none whatever. Seven-tenths of 
the railroad stock in the United States pay no 
dividends, and other corporations in the same 
plight are numbered by the thousand. 

The difficulty here is two-fold. In the first 
place, most people are so ignorant of the facts 
that they confound the agents of the corpora- 
tion with the owners of the property, while 
the former are primarily the managers only. 



The second error lies in drawing a hard-and- 
fast line between capitalists and employees. 
No such line exists. The workingman who is 
thrifty and saves his money is also a capitalist, 
and in many instances he is a stockholder. In 
the year 1893 the deposits in the savings banks 
of the United States were $1,800,000,000, and 
the depositors numbered 4,830,000. These 
savings were capital, and these depositors were 
capitalists. Looked at in this light, the propo- 
sition to tax corporations because they are cor- 
porations resolves itself into a very simple 
scheme to tax thrift and sobriety for the benefit 
of those who possess neither of these qualities. 

When these truths dawn upon the labor 
agitator and the socialistic thinker, the demand 
is instantly made that the manager be taxed, or 
at least that the rich man be taxed because he 
is rich. Perhaps there is more justice in this 
demand. Certain it is that the man who gets 
rich by his managerial ability the well-known 
but somewhat indefinable "captain of indus- 
try" can be taxed without appreciably dimin- 
ishing the amount he will produce, so long as 
the law stops short of taking all that he pro- 
duces. This is so, because to refuse to produce 
all that he can will be more harmful to himself 
than to anyone else. Mr. Means thinks that 
such a tax on profits, if it could be levied, would 
be objectionable because the smaller dealers, the 
men who produce just at the margin of profit, 
would be forced out of business ; and this, he 
seems to think, would be calamitous. Cer- 
tainly it would not. The result would be analo- 
gous to the introduction of labor-saving ma- 
chines, hard on a present generation of laborers 
and tradesmen, but finally beneficial to all. 

A tax on incomes would be more certain than 
a tax on profits, and as just as any tax can be, 
though Mr. Means does not think so. A tax 
on the " unearned increment " would also be 
just, but is less easily applied, and pretty cer- 
tain in its incidence to fall upon the man who 
pays the rent instead of upon the owner. Hence 
this is not at present a possible form of taxa- 
tion. We may say the same of many forms of 
tax upon bonds and stocks of corporations, 
such as railroads, breweries, mining companies, 
etc. The consumer pays the tax. Hence taxes 
upon capital are sure to fail. The alternative 
proposition that the government shall take all 
great corporate enterprises into its own hands 
is met by Mr. Means with a reference to the 
failures of the government so far, and to the 
extravagance and corruption at present inherent 
in government methods and government agents.

The Public Printing-office is one illustration ; 
the annual deficit in the Post-office department 
is another; the Philadelphia experiment in 
owning gas-works is a third. The enthusiast 
who advocates government ownership in the 
United States must be gently but firmly re- 
pressed until the advent of the millennium jus- 
tifies his hopes. 

When all is said, it remains true that com- 
petition, full, free, and open, is the best hope 
of the laboring man. But there is a domain 
in which law should and must be active. For 
instance, the law should see that the employer 
does not suffer from rampant trades-unionism ; 
that the non-union man is not oppressed by the 
same means ; that the employer is kept from 
" inducing " the laborer to buy land from him, 
or to rent from him alone, or to trade at his 
store exclusively. Any man acquainted with 
the conditions of the life of the laborer in many 
parts of the Union will know how serious these 
questions are, and how essential the use of 
legal restraint has become. The law can dis- 
pense justice here, precisely as it has already 
done in England and America in respect to the 
employment of women and children in mines 
and factories. And such legislation would in- 
crease the real wages of laborers, and would 
not in general reduce the aggregate production. 

It seems to the reviewer that there is in 
Mr. Means's book a failure to point out a very 
real difficulty in the industrial situation, and 
one apparently inseparable from it under the 
regime of freedom, the fact that the welfare 
of the individual is too often opposed to the 
general welfare. For example, it is a benefit 
to glass-blowers to have glassware broken ; to 
printers to have type set by hand ; to small 
retail dealers to have department stores abol- 
ished ; to carpenters that fires should be numer- 
ous ; to smart financiers that superfluous rail- 
roads should be constructed and unnecessary 
buildings erected. Yet all these things are 
opposed to the general welfare. The man who 
builds an unnecessary railroad is guilty of an 
act that is destructive to the interests of capital 
and labor alike. What is to be done with such 
an one? How are we to reconcile the conflict- 
ing interests of individuals with the interests 
of all the people ? This is in fact the great 
problem, and the man who solves it will deserve 
eternal honor. 

A general criticism of Mr. Means's method 
may be offered. What he says is true enough, 
but only when the conditions specified are all 
present. But these conditions never are all 



present ; and hence the conclusions point only 
to a general policy to be pursued. Again, 
while Mr. Means defines his terms strictly, he 
uses them loosely ; occasionally, too, he omits 
some element of the problem which would put 
a very different face on the argument. Thus, 
on page 42 he reasons as if the entrepreneur 
did not exist, while in his chapter on the nature 
of profits the great manager is very prominent 
indeed ; he declares that railroads which are 
not able to declare dividends pay their em- 
ployees " not only all that their services are 
worth, but more than they are worth " (page 
46), while on page 99 he declares that " We 
must maintain as our standard of justice the 
equality of reward with sacrifice." If this is 
the true principle, certainly the services of a 
brakeman on a railroad are not to be measured 
by the corporation's ability to pay dividends. 
He also fails to note that frequently the rail- 
roads have only themselves to blame if they 
cannot pay dividends (page 46), while later he 
clearly points this out (page 116). He holds 
that the rate of profits may be measured to some 
extent by the rate of interest (page 155), and 
yet he shows that this is not so, " since the 
decline of interest . . . has taken place be- 
cause property has been protected and profits 
increased under modern methods of govern- 
ment" (page 189). 

When all exceptions are taken, however, it 
must be said that Mr. Means has given us a 
very helpful and very readable book, and one 
which is well calculated to convince the man we 
all wish to convince, the honest third man who 
is in doubt and is willing to be set right.

A MONUMENTAL, WORK FOR BIBLE 
STUDENTS.* 



Volume I. of " The Expositor's Greek Testa- 
ment " gives us the first instalment of a monu- 
mental work, under the general editorial super- 
vision of Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll, which is 
intended to do for Bible students of to-day 
what was done for those of a former generation 
by Alford. In point of size the work bids fair 
to surpass its ambition, and in mechanical exe- 
cution it cannot fail of such good fortune. In

all the improvement seen in the manufacture 
of theological works, there is none more marked 
than that which distinguishes this sumptuous 
volume from its literary ancestry. 

In reality, the present volume contains two 
separate commentaries, each by as eminent a 
biblical student as Scotland can boast. Between 
the two treatises there is naturally a general 
similarity in method. Each has its Introduc- 
tion, and each its interpretative portion. To 
examine any one of these four portions in de- 
tail is quite impossible ; but each has its excel- 
lences and its insufficiences. Chief among the 
latter is that which is common to both the 
use of the Textus Receptus. Why this aston- 
ishing relapse of scholarship is permitted, is 
very lamely explained. It is true that critical 
readings are inserted below the text ; but why, 
in this stage of the textual criticism of the New 
Testament, it is necessary to force every stu- 
dent to make his own critical text, is hard to see. 

So far as the Introductions go, there is a 
surprising conservatism in that of Professor 
Dods, who devotes over twenty-three pages to 
a learned and elaborate establishing of the un- 
modified Johannine authorship of the gospel, of 
which space only a page and a half deal with 
the hypothesis that the book as it stands is of 
Johannine origin but written by one of John's 
disciples. It is disappointing to see the off- 
hand fashion in which this position is pushed 
aside in what seems a sort of postscript to the 
real discussion. In Professor Bruce's Intro- 
duction we have a characteristically graphic 
presentation of the synoptic problem, which is 
admirably brought down to date. In fact, it 
would be difficult to find elsewhere so good a 
statement of the entire matter in the same space. 

In the exegesis, it will perhaps be found that 
the relative worth of the two parts will be 
higher. Professor Dods is thoroughly at home 
in working as an exegete within the limits set 
him in a brief running commentary, and the 
work of Professor Bruce has preserved, even in 
its conciseness, much of its attractive literary 
quality. Neither author could be guilty of 
unscholarly writing, though there is a decided 
difference between the somewhat formal exe- 
getical studies of the one and the flowing com- 
ment of the other. There may be some ques- 
tion whether in either case the compression of 
Alford has been equalled, and one cannot help 
regretting occasionally that the perspective of 
interpretation has not been better kept, and 
that Professor Bruce's critical positions have 
not been of greater service in exegesis. But, 



taken all in all, if we are to have Alford re- 
divivus it is probable that the present volume 
is as good as we could expect. Certainly it is 
eminently usable, and much of its exposition is 
stimulating and illuminating ; while, apart from 
the matters above indicated, its insufficiencies 
are due to the endeavor to get text and comment 
within certain fixed limits of space. At all 
events, it is no small advantage to have the 
opinions of two such men as the present authors 
upon the four gospels, even though we may not 
be able to know all the data upon which these 
opinions are based. SHAILER MATHEWS.

consideration, the "John Oliver Hobbes," known 
to her friends as Mrs. Craigie, the interest is pecu- 
liarly marked, for the striking qualities displayed in 
her first two or three books were of a sort which 
might give distinction to a social sketch or a draw- 
ing-room comedy, but which could not be counted 
upon to give distinction to work done upon a large 
canvas or having the world for a stage. In other 
words, it takes more than cleverness to produce seri- 
ous fiction, and the sparkle and caustic wit that 
sufficed for such books as " Some Emotions and a 
Moral " offered no promise of such a book as " The 
School for Saints." Moreover, Mrs. Craigie had 
produced one book of ampler dimensions which could 
be regarded as only a failure, and her later work 
had seemed to offer indications that a rather thin 
vein of observation was about exhausted. " The 
School for Saint?," then, comes to us as an agree- 
able surprise, for it shows an unexpected growth of 
the powers of the writer, and a grasp of the deeper 
problems of life for which her earlier efforts had 
done little to prepare the public. It is a full-grown 
novel in itself, and at the end we learn that it is but 
the first part of a still larger work, the continuation 
of which we shall await with impatience. The book 
is essentially a picture of European society in the 
last days of the Third Empire. It deals with polit- 
ical and social life in England, France, and Spain, 
as well as the mythical Duchy of Alberia, and 
gives us bold presentations of such public men as 
Disraeli, such events as the Carlist uprising of 1869, 
and such tendencies of thought as the rising tide of 
the reaction against liberalism. It is, moreover, 
made intensely vital by the strong personality of 
Robert Orange, who is a part of all these things 
a friend of Disraeli, a knight-errant of Spanish 
legitimacy, and a type of the conservative temper 
that can find rest only in the acceptance of authority 
in religious, and of consecrated tradition in political, 
matters. The point of view is one which cannot be 
ours, or that of any purely rational student of affairs, 
and it is a noteworthy tribute to the author's success 
to acknowledge that she compels our sympathy for 
the outworn ideals that are hers ; investing them 
with both dignity and moral attractiveness. To 
sum up, " The School for Saints " is a book based 
upon much reflective knowledge, and having both 
strength and distinction of manner. Per contra, it 
retains a little too much of the " pointed " epigram- 
matic style that served so well to introduce the 
writer into literature, and its idealism now and 
then skirts the regions of sentimental absurdity. 
The hero at times barely escapes the imputation of 
priggishness, and the heroine usually speaks in a 
language better fitted to a woman of sixty than to 
a girl of sixteen. 

" The Beth Book," by Mrs. Sarah Grand," offers 
us no such development of power as is illustrated 
by the volume last under discussion. Every dis- 
cerning reader of " The Heavenly Twins " must 
have realized that chaotic performance to be the 
work of a woman for whom, no matter how many 



books she might produce, no intellectual growth was 
possible, and nothing like artistic success ever attain- 
able. Accumulation, not selection, is her method, 
and her paragraphs are chunks of verbiage rather 
than polished instruments of expression. Her book 
is an attempt to do for a girl what Mr. Barrie did 
for a boy in " Sentimental Tommy " that is, to 
describe the development of a child of genius. If 
she had left off where Mr. Barrie did, leaving us to 
imagine the years of ripened power instead of at- 
tempting to characterize them, we should have had 
a different verdict to record from that which the 
book as a whole makes necessary. For the story 
of Beth's childhood is told with no little insight and 
charm, and she is too winsome a creature for the 
fate that awaits her in the later chapters. " The 
Beth Book" is clearly a book with a purpose, 
although it is difficult to state just what purpose. 
It might be described as a tract directed against a 
certain class of hospitals for women, although even 
on this point the writer's logic is painfully to seek. 
To assume that the sex is degraded by the provision 
of such hospitals is an utterly impossible thesis, yet 
it seems to be maintained in all seriousness by this 
writer. In a larger view, her purpose is to pro- 
claim the wrongs of downtrodden woman, which 
is done by placing Beth in contrast with the uncon- 
vincing domestic tyrant who figures as her father, 
and the utterly unimaginable brute who makes her 
his wife. The working out of this contrast, together 
with much railing at the wickedness of man in gen- 
eral, and at the social ideals of the mid- Victorian 
period, serves to keep the story going for many long 
chapters after it has ceased to have any human in- 
terest. There are many touches of vitality and 
glimpses of sincere feeling in the book, a fact which 
makes its shapelessness and bad temper and lack of 
artistic restraint only the more exasperating. 

A considerable but somewhat perverse power is 
displayed in " The Tormentor," which again directs 
attention to the author of " Nancy Noon." The 
chief character in this book is a young man whose 
conduct is uncontrolled by any apparent ethical 
motive, and who, conscious of the possession of in- 
tellectual powers much out of the common, applies 
them to the moral vivisection of his neighbors. He 
thus becomes, in pure wantonness, the " tormentor " 
of a considerable number of his fellow-beings, and 
the recital of his experiments is anything but edify- 
ing. The book has a certain distinction of style and 
phrase which gives it a remotely Meredithian flavor, 
but it is not pleasant either to peruse or to think 
about afterwards. 

" Margot " is a pretty story of love and suffering, 
which links in strange fashion the fortunes of an 
English gentleman, a girl of unfortunate parentage, 
and a Siberian exile. The scene is laid partly in 
England and partly in France. There are some 
amateurish features about the book, and more of 
sentiment than passion, although the author has 
evidently sought to introduce the latter quality into 
his book. The sections of the story are not very

THE DIAL 



deftly articulated, but it all comes somehow to a 
conclusion, and a reasonably happy one at that. 

Miss M. E. Coleridge is the author of " The King 
with Two Faces," a historical romance of Sweden 
at the close of the last century. The striking figure 
of Gustavus III. occupies a central position in the 
narrative, and the episode of the siege of Gothen- 
burg is made the subject of some descriptive pas- 
sages that are vivid and almost brilliant. After 
this, we witness the efforts of the King to establish 
himself as an absolute monarch, and finally his end 
at the hands of an assassin. With all this historical 
matter there is interwoven a tragic tale of private 
love, and a great diversity of incidental matter. 
The book is of considerable interest, although it 
drags in the closing chapters. 

" By a Hair's Breadth " is a novel of nihilist con- 
spiracy, and deals with certain imagined attempts 
upon the life of the present Tsar upon the occasion 
of his imperial progress through Austria, France, 
and England. The material of the plot is all so 
hackneyed that a more talented romancer than Mr. 
Headon Hill could hardly have hoped to invest it 
with any fresh interest. The agent of the Third 
Section is not a convincing sort of person, and the 
nihilists whom he tracks are all figures taken from 
the melodramatic stage. Even his Englishman cuts 
a poor figure, although all that could be expected of 
a man betrothed to as slangy a sort of girl as the 
English heroine. 

The sort of romance that Mr. Crockett weaves 
out of the materials afforded by Scottish history is 
pretty well known by this time, and little need be 
said of " Lochinvar " beyond recording the fact that 
its scene is laid partly in Scotland and partly in 
Holland, and that it dates from the eventful year 
1688. The Prince of Orange himself figures in two 
or three episodes, and the book is filled with ro- 
mantic adventures of the most exciting sort. It is 
one of Mr. Crockett's best books, and is written 
largely in the English language. 

We wish that we might say also of Lord Ernest 
Hamilton's border romance, " The Outlaws of the 
Marches," that it is written in the English lan- 
guage, for we are sure that it would be interesting 
if it were intelligible. But when a single page, 
taken almost at random, yields such linguistic nug- 
gets as " prein-head," "ongains," "mirdin'," "gau- 
kieing," "snoick," "mim," "meeth," "whitter," 
" pake," " tynd," " cow-clynks," " sharnie," " flea- 
luggit," " clushete," " daidling," and " quey," be- 
sides the more familiar forms of the Scots dialect, 
we feel bound to protest. Nor does the glossary at 
the end of the book relieve our feelings ; we cannot 
escape the suspicion, moreover, that some of this is 
bad language. As for the story, we have made out 
its general trend, and find the gist of it to be a ro- 
mance of the Scottish border in the sixteenth cen- 
tury. It tells how the mighty race of the Armstrongs 
(a clan suggestive of Mr. Blackmore's Doones) long 
defied both God and man, but met their deserved 
fate in the end. The love-story is a pretty one, and 



the illustrations, which are all plates of scenery 
reproduced from photographs, are not only a joy in 
themselves, but offer a valuable hint to those illus- 
trators who design groups of puppets more wooden 
even than the descriptions to which they are fitted. 
The average illustration of the average novel is a 
most distressing thing, and the expenditure which it 
involves is something worse than waste. 

" The Juggler " is not a particularly well-made 
story, nor is the figure of its chief character an 
attractive one. But it has the two unfailing ele- 
ments of Miss Murfree's strength clear insight 
into the character of the Tennessee mountaineer and 
a marvellous power of poetical interpretation when 
it deals with the natural aspects of the region which 
he inhabits. When inspired by her beloved moun- 
tains, the powers of the author become, as it were, 
transfigured, the utterance is so large, so free from 
the trammels of her individuality, so finely conso- 
nant with the mystery and the majesty of the scenes 
she describes. This one thing Miss Murfree has 
done for American literature so supremely well that 
she stands almost without a rival. It is as far as 
possible removed from fine writing; it seems to 
have the inevitable quality, and bears no mark of 
the self-conscious rhetorician. 

Nothing could be more sharply contrasted with 
such work than the photographic realism of Miss 
Wilkins, exhibited already in so many studies of 
New England character. Here nature counts for 
little, and life for nearly everything, a life, more- 
over, that is pictured with touches whose delicacy 
suggests Jane Austen or Meissonnier. " Jerome, a 
Poor Man " is the most ambitious of Miss Wilkins's 
books, and its realism is not so uncompromising as 
to refuse absolutely admission of the elements of 
romance. Although the hero is " a poor man," and 
although we are spared no detail of his grim strug- 
gle with poverty, he is allowed the good fortune of 
a windfall in the shape of a legacy, and his toil leads 
in the end to prosperity and happiness. The story 
of this legacy involves the one questionable point in 
the whole scheme of the book. As a boy, impelled 
by a great desire to help those who are, like himself, 
struggling for the means of subsistence, Jerome 
makes a vow that if he ever becomes possessed of 
any large sum of money he will distribute it indis- 
criminately among the poor of his township. The 
legacy permits fulfilment of this rash vow, and we 
are not sure that the author does not believe such 
indiscriminate charity to be desirable and really 
helpful to its beneficiaries. Her main object is, of 
course, to illustrate the effect of this conduct upon 
two other men, who are shamed into something like 
emulation of it, and to close the book in a sort of 
Christmas atmosphere of good will toward men. 
But the moral is still questionable from the stand- 
point of a sound sociology, and we wish that the 
main result might have been achieved by some other 
means. The heroine, appropriately named Lucina, 
is not a success, and we can hardly wish Jerome joy 
in the possession of so insipid and doll-like a creature.

[Feb. 1, 



But men in love do not always know what is best 
for them, and a familiar moral is thus pointed once 
more. 

We go once more to the mountains in the com- 
pany of Mr. John Fox, Jr., whose story of " The 
Kentuckians " is the most serious piece of work thus 
far attempted hy this growing writer. There is 
little here to suggest Miss Murfree, for to Mr. Fox 
the mountains hardly exist as natural phenomena, 
but are merely the physical environment of a hardy 
human stock kept out of the march of civilization by 
their barriers, and relapsed into something like bar- 
barism. The core of this book is the story of a feud 
between two mountain clans, a feud as grim as those 
of the sixteenth century borderers described in " The 
Outlaws of the Marches." When we read in the 
newspapers of two Kentuckians who meet in the 
streets of some town, and try to kill each other at 
sight, we read only of the efflorescence of an antag- 
onism whose roots and trunk are likely to be hidden 
in some fastness of the wilderness. Hence our edi- 
torial sermonizing is apt to fall wide of the mark, 
mistaking what is accidental for what is essential. 
Mr. Fox does not sermonize overmuch, but he ex- 
plains, thereby doing far better service to the stu- 
dent of these social phenomena. His standpoint is 
right ; these things are a part of savagery, but they 
are not to be done away with by appeals to a social 
ideal that simply does not exist in the mental make- 
up of those concerned, that must, in fact, first be 
created by a laborious educational process before it 
may be appealed to effectively. Mr. Fox has given 
us in this book a virile presentation of his theme, 
and we are grateful to him for it. 

Mr. Charles K. Lush is a new writer, and if he 
has it in him to produce more books of the quality 
of " The Federal Judge " he is not likely to lack 
encouragement from the critics. His story takes us 
straight into the heart of present-day politics and 
involves one of the burning social problems of the 
hour. It is, briefly, the story of a railway king and 
an incorruptible judge. The former is a man of the 
keen, forceful, unscrupulous type who figures so 
largely in the industrial life of the present ; the latter 
is a man of simple straightforward character, who 
becomes, without in the least suspecting it, the mere 
tool of the other. The manner in which Judge 
Dunn, the sworn foe of monopolies and corporate 
wealth, is raised from the obscurity of his country 
circuit to the federal bench by the designing Gard- 
well, and the way in which his very simplicity is 
wrought upon to his undoing, is described in a skil- 
ful way, and is to a considerable extent typical of 
actual conditions. The lesson that no man may 
entirely escape being affected by his environment, 
and that the best-intentioned of judges will be influ- 
enced by the subtle forces that electrify the atmos- 
phere in which the money-getters of a great city 
have their being, is admirably presented in this 
book, and there is no need of pointing the moral. 
Thus it comes about that our judge, in spite of his 
natural bent, is persuaded to join hands with the 



schemer who has gained his confidence, and to issue, 
at a critical juncture in the affairs of a great rail- 
way system for the control of which two equally 
unscrupulous factions are contending, one of the 
famous strike injunctions that made so great a stir 
two or three years ago. Here is the burning ques- 
tion raised by the novel, and we are bound to say 
that both sides of the argument that rages about such 
injunctions are presented with fairness, although the 
balance of the author's sympathies does not seem to 
incline in the direction in which we would have it. 
And we must confess that to Gardwell, who is also 
in a way the product of an unwholesome environ- 
ment, the author seems to have meted out too harsh 
a fate. Unscrupulous as the man is, there are as- 
pects of his character that excite admiration and 
even respect, and when he dies, we have something 
of the feeling of the boy-reader who follows hia 
favorite pirate to execution. 

One is much prepossessed in favor of " Lorraine," 
the new romance of Mr. Robert W. Chambers, by 
the poem that serves as a preface. It is so charming 
that we must reproduce it entire. 

" When Yesterday shall dawn again, 
And the long line athwart the hill 
Shall quicken with the bugle's thrill, 
Thine own shall come to thee, Lorraine ! 

" Then in each vineyard, vale, and plain, 
The quiet dead shall stir the earth 
And rise, reborn, in thy new birth 
Thou holy martyr-maid, Lorraine ! 

" Is it in vain thy sweet tears stain 
Thy mother's breast ? Her castled crest 
Is lifted now ! God guide her quest ! 
She seeks thine own for thee, Lorraine ! 

"So Yesterday shall live again, 
And the steel line along the Rhine 
Shall cuirass thee and all that 's thine. 
France lives thy France divine Lorraine! " 

Unless we are much mistaken, this lyric will be pre- 
served in the anthologies. The story which it intro- 
duces is much the best piece of work that Mr. 
Chambers has given us, and the best story of the 
Franco-Prussian War, with the possible exception 
of Herr Spielhagen's " Allzeit Voran," that has ever 
come to our notice. By an ingenious conceit, the 
name of the French province is also the name of 
the heroine of the book, and one of the sweetest 
creations of recent romance is thus linked by both 
verbal and actual association with the fair province 
which might but not right wrested from the bosom 
of the mother-country a quarter of a century ago. 
The story is delightful from beginning to end, ten- 
der and pathetic, at one moment the embodiment 
of delicate feeling, at another stirred with war's 
alarums and vivid dramatic action. The only his- 
torical figure of any consequence is that of the Man 
of Sedan, viewed in the hour of impending or accom- 
plished retribution, and the sketch is not one to be 
easily forgotten. We think, however, that the au- 
thor fell into an artistic fault when he made his 
heroine the daughter of the Emperor, stolen at birth 
by a frenzied sufferer from the coup d'etat. And

we wish that Mr. Chambers had refrained from 
venting so much spleen upon Thiers and Gambetta, 
whom he cordially detests. Such matter as the fol- 
lowing is out of place in a work like " Lorraine," 
and strikes a painfully false note : " Gambetta. that 
incubus of bombastic flabbiness, roaring prophecy 
and platitude through the dismayed city, kept his 
eye on the balcony of the particular edifice where, 
later, he should pose as an animated Jericho trum- 
pet. So, biding his time, he bellowed, but it was 
the Comedie Francaise that was the loser, not the 
people, when he sailed away in his balloon, posed, 
majestically squatting as the god of war above the 
clouds of battle. And little Thiers, furtive, timid, 
delighting in senile efforts to stir the ferment of 
chaos till it boiled, he, too, was there, owl-like, 
squeaky-voiced, a true ' bombyx a lunettes.' There, 
too, was Hugo often ridiculous in his terrible 
moods, egotistical, sloppy, roaring. The Empire 
pinched Hugo, and he roared ; and let the rest of 
the world judge whether, under such circumstances, 
there was majesty in the roar." Well, we should 
say that the world had judged, and found a very 
different verdict from that brought by Mr. Chambers. 
Even Thiers by no means deserves such censure, for 
he was a patriot at heart, although he made terrible 
mistakes of judgment, and was of anything but heroic 
aspect. We are sorry that so good a piece of fiction 
as Mr. Chambers has here given us should be marred 
by the occasional introduction of such a screed as 
has been quoted. The writing is vigorous, but the 
criticism is both wrongheaded and misplaced. 

Encouraged by the success of his earlier novel, 
" On the Red Staircase," Mr. M. Imlay Taylor has 
undertaken, in " An Imperial Lover," to produce 
what is to all intents and purposes a sequel to that 
interesting romance. Once more the hero, M. du 
Brousson, finds himself in Petersburg, this time as 
a grizzled marshal of France, sent on a diplomatic 
mission to the court in which he had won his own 
bride years before. In his suite is a young friend, 
who figures as the jeune premier of the present 
work, and whose love for the fair Najine meets with 
no less an obstacle than the rivalry of Peter the 
Great. The characterization of the Tsar is a fine 
piece of work, although his figure is given some- 
thing more of romantic coloring than the facts will 
warrant, and the series of plots and intrigues whereby 
his imperial will is thwarted and the lovers find the 
happiness that they deserve is devised with much 
ingenuity. The story is a clean and wholesome 
example of the sort of historical romance so much 
in vogue at present, and seems to us even better 
than its predecessor. 

The American short story seems to be increasingly 
given to studies in "local color." Mr. Brander 
Matthews, indeed, one of our adepts in the art of 
short-story telling, frankly styles his latest collection 
"Outlines in Local Color." The locality is, of 
course, the city of New York, and a dozen of the 
minor phases of its multifarious life are deftly pic- 
tured for us. We were a little startled when, open- 



ing the volume at random, we came upon the following 
remark : " I could not stand the vulgarity of the 
Dial. I 'm an old woman now, and I've seen a 
good deal of the world, but the Dial was too much 
for me. It seemed to be written down to the taste 
of the half-naked inhabitants of an African kraal." 
But it soon appeared that the sheet thus referred to 
was the New York ''Journal" in an unhappily 
ehosen disguise, and our feelings were relieved. 
These sketches by Mr. Matthews are extremely 
slight affairs, but they impress one with their truth- 
fulness, their fine sentiment, and the artistic quality 
of their style. 

Mr. Owen Wister's " Lin McLean," although 
ostensibly a collection of short stories, is in reality 
a continuous narrative, having for its central figure 
a cowboy, and for its incidents a series of episodes 
in his free, impulsive, and checkered existence. It 
presents to us a vividly conceived and loveable per- 
son, whose native refinement of character is not 
concealed either by his swaggering mien or his 
illiterate speech. He is a " type " in the artistic 
sense of that much-abused term, and he is drawn 
for us with knowledge and generous sympathy. 
Mr. Wister's book has both humor and pathos ; both 
are dry, but for that reason none the less effective, 
and our only wish is that the volume were twice as 
thick. 

Back to the East the provincial East this time 
we go with Miss Eliza Orne White, who has pro- 
duced a volume of bright stories dealing with the 
social types and incidents of the New England vil- 
lage. They are not very sober sketches, any of 
them, and the minute study of her subjects has not 
prevented the writer from being broadly human, or 
from working a vein of quiet humor that seems to 
be a distinctive part of her nature. " A Browning 
Courtship " is very amusing indeed, and " A Bis- 
marck Dinner " hardly less so. We may commend 
the stories for entertainment, at least, if not for any- 
thing more serious. 

Humor, also, is not lacking in Miss Alice French's 
collection of seven stories styled " A Book of True 
Lovers," but there is besides a touch of pathos some- 
thing deeper than Miss White offers her readers. 
Again we are in the West, the meridian of Iowa 
and of Arkansas, in the region and among the 
people of whom the author has so often written so 
lovingly, and whose homely ways she describes with 
so much insight into human nature. " Sir Guy the 
Neuter," which is a story of sixteenth century En- 
gland, offers the one exception to the above char- 
acterization, and seems rather out of place in the 
book, although it, too, is concerned with true lovers. 
The other six stories are of a piece in more respects 
than this, and exhibit a much more complete mas- 
tery of their material. 

Again we bring the name of Mr. Chambers into 
this review, for the purpose of saying a word or two 
of the charming qualities of the bits of romantic 
fiction which he has entitled, without the least ap- 
parent reason, " The Mystery of Choice." Perhaps

it is because of the mystery which hangs over most 
of these stories, leaving one greatly in douht as to 
what has really happened, and free to choose almost 
any interpretation that he pleases. Certainly the 
charm of these sketches is as elusive as it is undeni- 
able, for the most matter-of-fact incidents are 
invested with an atmosphere of nebulous romance, 
and the reader must often plunge without a mo- 
ment's warning from every-day actuality into a 
world of poetical and frequently uncanny imagin- 
ings. It is so different an aspect of the author's 
talent from that presented by his romances of mod- 
ern French history that it is difficult to believe the 
same pen at work in the two cases. 

Some, at least, of the stories comprised within 
Mr. Robert Herrick's new volume have already 
appeared in the magazines, where they attracted 
marked attention by their delicacy of manner and 
subtlety of analysis. They seem at times over- 
subtle, indeed, and suggestive of the attitude of pre- 
ciosity, although the writer makes a brave effort to 
seem careless and colloquial. Their essential pre- 
occupation is art, although it is the art of life quite 
as much as the art that is practised in studios, for 
life offers material no less plastic than clay in hands 
of the proper deftness. Mr. Herrick has thus far 
produced only literary figurines, but they are skil- 
fully modelled, and not without strength as well as

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Some American President Eliot's book entitled " Am- 
contributions erican Contributions to Civilization " 

to civilization. (Century Co.) is a collection of occa- 
sional addresses and magazine articles, mostly bear- 
ing on political and social questions. One of the 
most typical, the one which gives the collection its 
name, is the first, " Five American Contributions to 
Civilization." The five contributions in question 
are, an advance towards the abandonment of war, 
religious toleration, universal suffrage, the absorp- 
tion of many races, the diffusion of material well- 
being. Of course in making these contributions to 
civilization, America has been greatly aided by good 
fortune. The wide Atlantic has kept us from con- 
tact with European rivalries and ambitions, and so 
we have been able to avoid wars. The other lines 
of development have come naturally from the posi- 
tion of a new people in a new land. So, in fact, 
President Eliot might have attributed quite as much 
to these favorable circumstances as to our especial 
merit. He commends President Monroe for his 
declaration of 1823. " This announcement was 
designed to prevent the introduction on the Ameri- 
can continent of the horrible European system 
with its balance of power, its alliances, offensive and 
defensive, in opposing groups, and its perpetual 
armaments on an enormous scale." After reading 
this luminous exposition of the Monroe Doctrine, 



one may perhaps be permitted to wonder that the 
Harvard president fails to see that the extension of 
the system of European colonies this side the ocean 
the Africanization of South America will surely 
bring upon us the very state of things which Monroe 
aimed to prevent. But the Cleveland-Olney policy 
as to Venezuela and the maintaining of a strong 
navy Mr. Eliot strenuously deprecates. In fact, it 
is clear enough that they are two things which will 
keep us from the necessity of militarism on a large 
scale a necessity which some day will be on us if 
the western world is filled up with the colonies of 
the great military nations. Fugitive papers and 
addresses are hard to keep alive. Those in the 
present volume will hardly form a permanent addi- 
tion to literature. But nevertheless they are worth 
reading and that, after all, in these days, is high 
praise for any book. 

The great English astronomer, Prof. 

The dawn of T XT T i L 

Astronomy. J - Norman Lockyer, has given us a 

study of the temple-worship and 
mythology of the ancient Egyptians, in a work 
entitled " The Dawn of Astronomy " (Macmillan). 
It is a happy contribution to the sciences of myth- 
ology, comparative religion, and early civilizations. 
Dr. Lockyer visited the land of the Nile and ex- 
amined for himself the temples of the gods ; he has 
searched widely in literature for the latest light on 
early astronomy, and has found it all in the alembic 
of his own trained mind. While visiting Greece a 
few years ago, he was struck with the orientation 
of the great temples. It occurred to him that pos- 
sibly they owed their positions to the founders' ideas 
of the heavens. This thought he carried to Egypt, 
and applied it to the solution of the orientation of 
the scores of temples scattered over that land. Each 
temple was so built that a ray of light, sun, moon, 
or star, entering at the front could pierce into the 
most holy place. He soon discovered that some of 
the temples at Karnek are oriented to the sun-rising 
or to the sun-setting at the solstices. The temples 
at Gizeh are oriented to the sun-rising and setting 
at the equinoxes. In fact, the temples of Egypt 
were the first astronomical observatories in the 
world. The temple at Denderah is ornamented 
with some remarkable astronomical representations. 
It is evident from these and other points that the 
solstices were recognized in Egypt as early as 5000 
B. C. In fact, such an instrument as the temple 
was scientific in its ability to determine with accu- 
racy the length of the year, provided the observa- 
tions continued for some period of time. Besides 
the sun-temples, there were star-temples, oriented so 
that at a specified time a given star could penetrate 
the long avenue of the temple and flash its light 
into the sanctuary at the farther end. The author 
names (on pp. 306-14) eight stars to which, alto- 
gether, forty-two temples had been oriented. Of 
course, this must be determined (1) by the date of 
the construction of the temple as nearly as can be 
learned from inscriptions, (2) by the astronomical

calculations of the location of the star at that period. 
Astronomer and archaeologist together can thus 
locate with great accuracy the age of a temple. It 
is ascertained as a fact that some of the stars were 
observed as early as 5000 B. C. These facts lead 
to the conclusion that the temples of Upper Egypt 
mark an age earlier than those in and near the delta. 
From Egypt, the Greeks borrowed the same method 
of temple-orientation. While much of the book is 
technical, it is brimful of interest, with its facts and 
illustrations. _ 

Miss Lilian Bell is now furnishing 
the Western Continent with her im- 
pressions of Paris. She informs us 
that the city is " a whited sepulchre," and adds a 
statement of the way the French view marriage. 
There is an originality and a brilliancy about these 
views that may make some readers desire to read 
Miss Bell's " From a Girl's Point of View " (Har- 
per), even although they have no idea of what the 
particular topics may be that are viewed from the 
Point in question. For such as hesitate to acquire 
at random any stray considerations by Miss Bell, 
we will say that the matters girlishly viewed are, 
for instance, Men as Lovers, The Philosophy of 
Clothes, Love-making as a Fine Art, Girls and 
Other Girls, and so forth. A broad sympathy may 
make one desirous, perhaps, of knowing what a girl's 
view on these subjects may be. We incline to think 
that it will be more satisfactory to the male reader, 
at least, to receive an oral exposition of these man- 
ners from whatever girl he happens to like best. Such 
presentations are not very hard to come by, and are 
said to be often of considerable interest. As for read- 
ers of the other sex, the younger ones will like this 
book, for it is always nice to see one's own ideas in 
print ; those past their first youth, however, will 
probably wish to avoid it as anyone avoids the 
recollection of any follies of earlier days. We fear 
that no one will believe that we can really appre- 
ciate better than Miss Bell so delicate a matter as a 
girlish view of love or clothes. We shall not, there- 
fore, attempt to say whether the ideas of this book 
are or are not really from a girl's point of view. 
One thing we will venture to note. A characteristic 
element of girlhood (as of boyhood) is the appreci- 
ation of various matters very commonly and widely 
known, with the firm idea that they are now appre- 
ciated for the first time. This feeling is to be per- 
ceived in many of the remarks of Miss Bell, and 
we congratulate her on having herein so entirely 
assumed the position she had in mind. 



An vp-to-daie 
Theology. 



Dr. Lyman Abbott's " Theology of 
an Evolutionist " (Houghton) carries 
the distinction of being thoroughly 
up to date. It is primarily based on Professor Le 
Conte's definition of evolution : " A continuous pro- 
gressive change, according to certain laws, and by 
means of resident forces." This little volume (of 
191 pages) discusses only specific questions in the- 



ology ; some of these are, " Creation by Evolution," 
" Genesis of Sin," " Evolution of Revelation," 
" Place of Christ in Evolution," " Redemption by 
Evolution," " Evolution and Sacrifice, Propitiation, 
Miracles, and Immortality." These lectures are, 
in the main, a popularization and condensation of 
the latest utterances of Le Conte, Huxley, Romanes, 
and Drummond, on the relations of evolution and 
Christianity. At the outset, the author acknowl- 
edges that he is a radical, but at the same time a 
theistic evolutionist, who holds that religion " is 
better comprehended, and will better be promoted, 
by the philosophy which regards all life as divine, 
and God's way of doing things as the way of a con- 
tinuous progressive change, according to certain 
laws and by means of one resident force," and that, 
God (p. 10). The application of the principles of 
evolution to the doctrines of theology is the real 
point at issue. In the first lecture, " Creation by 
Evolution " was, if the author's reasoning holds, 
simply an initial dualism, where God and matter 
were two separate existences, combined only when 
matter began to revolve (p. 25). The lecture on 
" The Genesis of Sin " results in a non-committal 
statement by the author (p. 39), who says, never- 
theless, that " every sin is a falling back into the 
animal condition" (p. 49). In the lecture on the 
" Place of Christ in Evolution " the author adopts 
a kind of pantheism or monism (or is it dualism ? 
cf. p. 25), when he says, " All life is God ; all force is 
God " (p. 76). The whole discussion, though very 
readable, and plain as a rule, yet suffers from con- 
densation. The vital problems the genesis of 
matter, of the moral nature, of sin, of Christ are 
no clearer at the conclusion of Dr. Abbott's book. 
Other questions named in the contents acquire a 
newer and richer meaning at his hand. 

Collections of epigrams should not 

k 6 read aU at one time ' One cock ' 
tail or a taste of caviare is very nice, 

but you cannot make a meal off either. Too many 
leave a bad taste. Mr. F. W. Morton's compilation 
of " Men in Epigram " ("McClurg) is an interesting 
book, and a useful book too, in a way. Useful, we 
mean, to people who want epigrams ; for there is a 
double index, of subjects and of authors, so that 
one may easily get epigrams on the matter in hand 
or by the author in question. Interesting it is, too, 
or amusing if yon will, because you may pick it up 
a dozen times a day and always find something new 
and smart. If, however, you read much of it at a 
time, you not only become quickly satiated, but you 
come right up against this curious question : Why is 
it so much easier to say a disagreeable clever thing 
than one that is agreeable? Epigrams, as a rule, 
call attention to some folly, weakness, or failing. 
It is a great man who can make a clever comment 
on his kind that will lead you to think better of it. 
This book makes one rather ashamed of the species : 
if the epigrams be true, men are but poor things ; 
if they be false, the case is not much better, for what 



84 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



a pitiful spirit is shown in this affected knowledge 
of life and affected smartness and affected doubt of 
goodness. A book of epigrams is a most valuable 
commentary on the principle of realism. Every- 
thing may be true by itself alone, but the whole 
book is something of a falsity. " A man of maxims 
only," says Coleridge, on page 213, " is like a Cy- 
clops with only one eye, and that eye in the back of 
his head." Let us fortify ourselves with this con- 
solation, and we may for the moment smile even at 
La Rouchefoucauld. 

There is an immense amount of ma- 
" Song-tore." terial in Mr. Adair Fitz-Gerald's 

"Stories of Famous Songs" (Lippin- 
cott), although, as would be inferred from the title, 
it is presented in an easy and unconstrained fashion, 
and without much attempt at infusing order into 
what comes near being a chaos. To tell the truth, 
the subject of Famous Songs is hardly one with any 
really organic unity to be developed. It drifts on 
one side into a study of Ballad-poetry, which to-day 
is almost one of the learned professions ; on another 
it touches and overlaps parts of the history of Music 
and Literature ; and on another it becomes a sec- 
tion of what Stendhal would have called Folk- 
psychology, if such a matter still exist. From none of 
those points of view, however, does Mr. Fitz-Gerald 
contemplate the topic ; indeed, his work makes no 
claim to be a scientific treatise. He has for a long 
time collected material concerning well-known songs, 
and now orders it according to the simple and ex- 
cellent method of putting together those songs which 
seemed to him to be more or less connected. It is 
an interesting book to run through, and probably 
may also be of use as a book of reference, although 
the author often seems rather lenient in selecting 
authorities. It is very comprehensive ; several times 
we thought that something important had been 
omitted, but sooner or later we came upon the object 
of search. It is always pleasant to read about old 
favorites, and here, as one turns the page, hundreds 
of half-forgotten melodies run through the mind and 
give pleasure additional. " My true intent is all 
for your delight," says the author ; and we think 
that he may congratulate himself on a very fair 
measure of success. 

Sebastian Cabot appears to have had 

a better fortune than most men who 

have attempted to masquerade in the 
merits of others. Even as late as 1894 he was 
given the chief credit, in so authoritative a work 
as the Histoire Generate of Lavisse and Ram- 
baud, for the discovery of North America, especially 
through the voyage of 1498. But during the last 
few years a more careful examination of documents 
long known, and of those recently unearthed, has 
led historians like Henry Harrisse to regard Sebas- 
tian as little better than an impostor, appropriating 
his father's work as his own. Nearly all the evi- 
dence in the case is to be found in Mr. G. E. Weare's 



volume on " Cabot's Discovery of North America " 
(Lippincott). Mr. Weare prints the original docu- 
ments, with translations, accompanied by the com- 
ments of other writers. His book is therefore 
particularly valuable to students. He is unhappily 
inclined to leave the general reader to wander about 
among these " sources " with very little in the way 
of consecutive guidance. Although less polemic 
than Harrisse, he is evidently as ready to deprive 
Sebastian of his stolen honors, and to return them 
to the real discoverer, John Cabot. 



Literary 
and other 
statesmen. 



In his sheaf of essays in literary 
criticism entitled " Literary States- 
men and Others" (H. S. Stone & 
Co.), Mr. Norman Hapgood gives us some clever 
and suggestive appreciations of Messrs. John Mor- 
ley, Balf our, and Henry James. Other and slighter 
papers treat of Lord Rosebery, Stendhal, Me'rime'e, 
American Art Criticism, and American Cosmopol- 
itanism. Mr. Hapgood's touch is light and true, 
and his perception of the subtler individualities of 
style and method is keen. His essay on John Morley 
is a really clear-cut and effective piece of criticism. 
In one or two points, however, we are inclined to 
differ with Mr. Hapgood as to Mr. Morley for 
instance, when he says that Mr. Morley's " princi- 
ples " are " not set in a style of distinction, but 
rather in one soured by moralism and dessicated by 
science." There is a certain leaven or nuance of truth 
in the stricture ; but it is certainly too sweeping. 
Perhaps a re-reading of, say, Mr. Morley's eloquent 
introduction to his " Voltaire," or of his essay on 
Condorcet, would lead Mr. Hapgood to qualify his 
judgment. The publishers have issued this volume 
in their usual tasteful style. 

Colonel George E. Waring's fellow- 
war. citizens have long known him as an 

amiable man and a first-rate admin- 
istrator. A dainty booklet entitled "Whip and 
Spur " (Doubleday & McClure Co.) now puts them 
in the way of knowing him as an author. Should 
they avail themselves of this chance they will not 
regret it, since Colonel Waring shows conclusively 
that in addition to his genius for street-cleaning he 
has a very pretty talent for story-telling. In this 
little book he tells the stories and fondly paints the 
characters of horses that he has owned " Vix," 
" Ruby," Wellstein," " Max," and so on, and 
recounts incidentally some campaigning experiences, 
amusing, pathetic, and exciting. There is a closing 
chapter on " Fox-Hunting in England." The book* 
is neatly made, and contains a frontispiece showing 
Colonel Waring as a dashing trooper in the early 
sixties. _ 

The personal narrative of a tourist's 

extended jaunt is to be found in Mr. 

John R. Musick's " Hawaii, our new 
Possessions " (Funk & Wagnalls Co.). The book 
gives a very complete representation of the pictur- 
esque, complex, and varied life of the Islands, in 



of ^Pacific.

A new edition 



their social, industrial, commercial, and political 
aspects. Man rather than nature is the author's 
theme. The " uprising of 1895 " receives more 
attention than an eruption of Kilauea, and the con- 
trasted civilizations of the Occident and Orient ex- 
cite more interest than the changing panorama of 
tropical verdure, mountain, and sea, in this Para- 
dise of the Pacific. Politically speaking, the title 
belongs in the realm of prophecy ; but the history 
of recent events, of the overthrow of the monarchy 
and the establishment and vicissitudes of the repub- 
lic, is told with vividness and fulness. In this par- 
ticular the book supplements the earlier work of 
Jarvis and Alexander, though it lacks somewhat of 
their judicial candor and scholarly discrimination. 
The illustrations are abundant, and as a rule are 

well chosen. 

The centenary of the death of James 
Macpherson is fitly commemorated 
by the publication of a handsome new 
edition of the " Poems of Ossian," from the press of 
Messrs. Patrick Geddes & Colleagues of Edinburgh. 
In addition to a brief Introduction and notes by 
Mr. William Sharp, the volume contains the notes 
of Macpherson, and also of Hugh Campbell, editor 
of the edition of 1822. In his Introduction Mr. 
Sharp makes a careful review of the famous " Os- 
sianic Controversy," and sums up the evidence in 
the case as follows : " (1 ) Macpherson's ' Ossian ' 
is not a genuine rendering of ancient originals ; 
(2) he worked incoherently upon a genuine but un- 
systematised, unsifted, and fragmentary basis, with- 
out which he could have achieved nothing; (3) 
inherent evidence disproves Macpherson's sole or 
even main authorship as well as Ossian's, and that 
he was at most no more than a skilful artificer." 
Mr. Sharp further adds that " if Macpherson were 
the sole author, he would be one of the few poetic 
creators of the first rank, and worthy of all possible 
honour"; and also, "no single work in our litera- 
ture has had so wide-reaching, so potent, and so 
enduring an influence." Mechanically, this new 
edition is entirely satisfactory, and should find great 
favor with all lovers of these heroic fragments. 

In his " Fighting a Fire " (Century 
Co.), Mr. Charles Thaxter Hill gives 
a graphic account of the life of a 
metropolitan fireman, based on his own long and 
close association with the members of the New 
York fire department. The book tells how the fire 
department of a great city is organized, how the 
men are trained, how fire-alarms are transmitted, 
etc., and some space is devoted to the description of 
the many ingenious appliances of the well-equipped 
modern engine-house. Every branch of the service 
is explained, including " The Floating Fire-Engines," 
"The Fire Patrol," " The School for Firemen," etc., 
and there are a number of good stories illustrative 
of firemen and their ways and of the peculiar perils 
they are called on to encounter. The book contains 
some thirty spirited pictures by the author. 



The Talmud. 



Few persons know what " The Tal- 
mud" signifies. The booklet with 
this title, translated from the French 
of Arsene Darmester (Philadelphia : Jewish Publi- 
cation Society of America), is muttum in parvo on 
this theme. That stupendous library of rabbinic 
lore is here described with a fulness and a clearness 
not surpassed in many larger and more pretentious 
works. The uninterrupted work of Judaism from 
Ezra to the sixth century of the Christian era, a 
period of a thousand years, is gathered within the 
bounds of The Talmud. The characteristics of each 
separate document, both in content and spirit, are 
vividly portrayed. The relations of the synagogue, 
of the rabbis, and of a score of institutions to this 
great compilation are set forth with scholarly accu- 
racy and completeness. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



In a most unpromising volume from the typographical 
point of view, the Whitaker & Ray Co. of San Francisco 
have put forth "The Complete Poetical Works of 
Joaquin Miller." This is Mr. Miller's definitive edition 
of his work, and, as such, must have a place in every 
library of American poetry. The preface of some ten 
pages, written by the author for this volume, is a feature 
of much interest. " Even now," he says, " after all my 
cutting and care, I am far from satisfied, and can com- 
mend to my lovers only the few last poems in the book." 
These pages contain a garrulous mixture of autobiog- 
raphy and didacticism, interesting to read, and extremely 
characteristic of their author. 

The new edition of " The Spectator," which Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons import for sale in the United 
States, is as pretty a piece of book-making as is often 
seen. There is an introductory essay by Mr. Austin 
Dobson, while the editing and annotation of the text 
have been undertaken by Mr. G. Gregory Smith. " The 
main intention of these volumes is to preserve the orig- 
inal freshness of the text, to reject, in the words of old 
Thomas Sprat, ' all amplifications, digressions, and 
swellings of style,' and to ' return back to the primitive 
purity and shortness.' " There are to be eight volumes, 
printed with original spelling, punctuation, italics, etc. 

The " Journal " containing the papers and discussions 
presented at the 1897 meeting of the National Educa- 
tional Association, held at Milwaukee last summer, has 
just issued from the University of Chicago Press. It is 
a volume of over eleven hundred pages, and its con- 
tents embrace almost every conceivable subject of pres- 
ent-day interest to the pedagogical profession. The 
most important single feature is doubtless the Report 
of the Committee on Rural Schools, a document destined 
to exert a far-reaching influence upon a neglected de- 
partment of our public education. 

"England and the Reformation," by Mr. G. W. 
Powers, is a new volume in " The Oxford Manuals of 
English History " (Scribner). This admirable series of 
little books for school use, all but one of which are now 
issued, provide a continuous history of England, written 
by careful scholars, and embodying the most recent con- 
clusions of historical opinion. Mr. Powers has to deal 
with the whole of the Tudor period (1485-1603), and 
has compressed it into a readable book of 136 pages.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 



London, Jan. 15, 1898. 

Naturally, at the opening of a new year, the hope 
which " springs eternal in the human breast " finds its 
best definition by the experience of what has already 
touched us, and by our reflection on that experience. In 
this way we make resolutions and delude ourselves into 
a belief that what we wish will happen. The last year 
has not been altogether a pleasant one for those who dig 
and delve in the land of literature. If to a few it has 
brought the fulfilment of promise, to a great many more, 
on the other hand, it has denied this. Reputations have 
come and gone. Two years ago the air was resonant of 
the praise for newly discovered geniuses. Poets abounded 
in every garret of New Grub street, and the welkin rang 
with snouts for John Davidson, Richard Le Gallienne, 
William Watson, Francis Thompson, and the rest. Vigo 
street and the Head of Bodley were having their innings. 
There were " jawblings " and " jucundings," and the 
" Yallerbock " was at large. But the year just ended 
has brought a change. We have had our fun, and now 
we are meditating on the foolishness of it all. It has 
been a time of quiet, on the whole; and it is, perhaps, 
well that it was so. It has enabled us to devote a little 
space to some high thinking on the works of such men 
as Benjamin Jowett and Tennyson; for the biographies 
of these two fine workers, if they cannot rank as great 
literature, yet furnish us with a storehouse of sugges- 
tions. We have had no new Boswell, but that does not 
much matter, since we do not often get a Samuel 
Johnson. Without a doubt, the Boswellian spirit is dead, 
and the days of hero-worship gone. He who now has 
the ability to appreciate greatness and to express that 
appreciation, believes himself to merit a Boswell on 
his own account. And so the days go by with their 
quota of novels and verses; and the biographic art is 
lost. In history also we cannot boast much. Mr. Gar- 
diner's further contribution on the seventeenth century, 
and Mr. Justin McCarthy's final addition to his " His- 
tory of Our Own Times," make no great display. The 
only book of travels of any true literary value was Miss 
Kingsley's " West Africa," and this in spite of the tre- 
mendous Nansen pother. We thought that in poetry, 
surely, this year would be prolific and possibly strong. 
But we look in vain in Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton's 
volume, or in Mr. Watson's " Hope of the World," or in 
Mr. Thompson's " New Poems," for any sign that the 
flame is burning. 

No; the year just ended must, without question, be 
called the year of the novelist. He has reaped a rich 
harvest both of money and fame. Whatever may be 
thought of the sensational writers or the problem 
solvers, they have certainly furnished much matter for 
talk and much " copy " for critics. Mr. Hall Caine and 
Mrs. Grand and " George Egerton " have earned well 
of that society which feels itself impelled to " save " 
mankind ; and it must be confessed, if appreciation is to 
be measured by large sales, these writers have been 
excellently well served. But apart from these, the year 
is distinguished for Robert Louis Stevenson's " St. Ives," 
Mr. Hardy's " Well-Beloved," Mr. Blackmore's Da- 
riel," Mr. Kipling's " Captains Courageous," Mr. Henry 
James's "What Masie Knew," Ouida's "The Massa- 
renes," Mr. Wells's The Invisible Man," Mr. William 
Morris's " Water of the Wondrous Isles," Mr. Anthony 
Hope's " Phroso," and Dr. Conan Doyle's " Uncle 
Bernac." 



Here we see the explanation for the forgetting of the 
arts of writing history or biography. The gay play of 
the imagination finds fuller freedom and a more joyous 
existence in the kingdom of fiction; so that we find writ- 
ers, whose style truly fit them for the office of historian 
or biographer, heavily weighting their fancy with the 
cumbrous phrases of character analyses, and the strained 
developments of intricate circumstances. They are, in 
reality, writing contemporary history; only they often 
include that which is not in life, or, if they deal with 
life, they forget to picture the other side. But the 
criticism should be, not so much against the writers of 
fiction, as against the conditions which enable them to 
flourish. The transfiguration of life either in the form 
of romance or of poetry must always appeal to us 
strongly. " We look before and after, and pine for 
what is not." Romance and poetry serve to feed 
healthily this primal instinct of our natures. But the 
presentation of social problems and physiological theo- 
ries belongs not to fiction but to sociology and medicine. 
Our scientific researches and discoveries have overlapped 
our aesthetic taste, and we are fast erasing the lines 
which separate the arts. 

I have given so much space to retrospective matter 
that I can only touch on a few of the promises of the 
new year. As yet, however, there are few that call 
for mention. There is to be issued shortly a great book 
on the Yukon Territory, giving the American and Cana- 
dian points of view ; the former to be stated by Mr. W. 
Dall, a gentleman sent out officially years ago, to report 
on the district. I am glad to learn that the edition-de-luxe 
of Lever's novels, about which I have already written 
to you, is to be published on your side of the water by 
Messrs. Roberts Brothers of Boston. As it would be 
unfair for you to take all our good things, a publisher 
in London is to issue a small edition of the magnificent 
Wormeley " Balzac " which Boston had the enterprise 
and good taste to achieve. Thus we take a good thing 
from you. 

The trouble about booksellers and discounts is not 
yet over. To the report of the Society of Authors, a 
leading bookseller of Glasgow, Mr. Robert Maclehose, 
M.A., has furnished a convincing reply. It may be news 
to you, and if it is it will be strange news, to hear that 
a bookseller, in this country, to make a profit of $850 
per annum has to accomplish a net turnover of $52,500; 
while on a net turnover of $30,000, there would be a 
loss of $100 ! Yet this, Mr. Maclehose proved some 
time ago. Of course, the action of the Society in re- 
jecting the proposals made by the Publishers and Book- 
sellers' Associations cannot affect the result. But at 
present the question is held over. 

To the few here who have a copy of Mr. Growoll's 
book, " American Book Clubs," the volume is a great 
delight and a source of much interest. It is an exceed- 
ingly able contribution to bibliography, and I congratu- 
late Mr. Growoll.

A NEW series of " The American Journal of Archae- 
ology " is about to begin, published, as heretofore, by 
the Macmillan Co. It will appear bi-monthly, at a sub- 
scription price of five dollars annually. The same pub- 
lishers are soon to issue a facsimile of the Catullus 
manuscript discovered two years ago in the Vatican 
library by Professor W. G. Hale, at that time director 
of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome.

LiITERART NOTES. 

A collection of the plays of Mr. Bernard Shaw, in 
two volumes, will be published shortly by Messrs. H. S. 
Stone & Co. 

The Doubleday & McClure Co., who are to publish 
a collected edition of the works of Henry George, have 
just issued a new popular edition of " Progress and 
Poverty." 

The J. B. Lippineott Co. announce for early publica- 
tion "A Desert Drama," a new novel by Dr. Conan 
Doyle. It will deal with the adventures of a party of 
tourists on the Nile. 

A volume of " Inductive Studies in Browning," for 
use in schools and literary clubs, has been prepared by 
Dr. Hans C. Peterson, and is published by Mr. J. H. 
Miller, of Lincoln, Neb. 

Miss Mamie Dickens's "My Father as I Recall 
Him," the English edition of which we noticed in our 
issue of Oct. 1, 1897, is now published in this country 
by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

" The Tinted Venus," the familiar " farcical romance " 
of Mr. Guthrie (F. Anstey), has just been accorded by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers the honors of a handsome 
library edition, illustrated by Mr. Bernard Partridge. 

One of the interesting features of the " Chap- Book " 
for the coming year will be a new series of " Letters to 
Dead Authors," by Mr. Andrew Lang. It is announced 
that henceforth the " Chap-Book " will contain illus- 
trations. 

" An Introduction to American Literature," by Mr. 
Henry S. Pancoast, is about to be published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. If it prove as good as Mr. Pan- 
coast's text-book of English literature, it will deserve a 
warm welcome. 

Professor William Knight, of St. Andrews, known to 
all Wordsworthians and many other people, is coming 
to this country in the early spring to fill a number of 
lecture engagements. He will reach Chicago at the end 
of March, to speak before the Twentieth Century Club 
and at the University of Chicago. 

" Is interest in poetry declining in America ? " This 
is the question recently put by a New York publishing 
house to three or four hundred representative poets, 
editors, publishers, booksellers, and librarians. Nearly 
three hundred replies were received, of which about 
seven-eighths were in the negative. 

Mrs. Mary Cowden Clarke, who was one of the re- 
, markable group of writers born in 1809 the literary 
annus mirabilis of the century died the other day at 
Genoa, where she had made her home for many years. 
She is best known by her " Girlhood of Shakespeare's 
Heroines," and by her concordance of the works of 
Shakespeare. 

M. Georges Pellissier, the author of " The Literary 
Movement in France during the Nineteenth Century " 
(a translation of which was recently published in this 
country) has prepared a second volume of this ponderous 
but useful history. The author will come to the United 
States next autumn for the purpose of lecturing upon the 
same general subject. 

Everyone interested in humane education by which 
is meant the educating of people to be just and kind to 
animals will be cheered by the appearance of so ex- 
cellent a journal as " The Humane Alliance," a well 
printed and attractively illustrated monthly, published 
by the National Humane Alliance, United Charities 



Building, New York. The paper is edited with tact 
and intelligence, and is well adapted to interest children 
and impress them with its gospel of gentleness and 
mercy. Its price is but fifty cents a year, and it should 
find a welcome in every civilized home. 

"The American Naturalist," founded in 1867 by 
four of the pupils of Agassiz, has for thirty years held 
an honorable place among our scientific periodicals. A 
new series begins with the present year, under the edi- 
torship of Dr. Robert P. Bigelow, and we are promised 
that the magazine shall be better than ever before. 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. are now the publishers. 

The Kashmirian birch-bark manuscript of the A t h arva- 
Veda is one of the most precious Oriental documents in 
existence. It was brought to light in 1875 by the re- 
searches of Professor Rudolph von Roth, who guarded 
it until his recent death, when it passed into the posses- 
sion of the University of Tuebingen. It consists of 287 
leaves, written on both sides, with dimensions of 20 x 25 
cm. Professor Maurice Bloomfield is about to prepare 
a photographic reproduction of this manuscript, and in- 
vites subscriptions at twenty-five dollars for the pro- 
posed edition of two hundred copies. Mr. N. Murray, 
Johns Hopkins University, will receive applications for 
the work. 

The publishing section of the American Library As- 
sociation has at last got well under way with a long- 
projected plan for cataloguing the contents of current 
periodicals of the more serious sort. The work is made 
possible by the initiative of five of the largest libraries 
in the country, but it needs a great deal more coopera- 
tion than has yet been secured to ensure its success 
upon a scale as large as is desirable. The beginning 
now made takes the form of an arrangement for print- 
ing catalogue cards, indexing the contents of 184 peri- 
odicals and proceedings of learned societies, and supply- 
ing these cards either in full sets or in selections 
to libraries that may wish to subscribe. The undertaking 
is one of the greatest importance, and deserves every 
encouragement. The plan permits of indefinite exten- 
sion, and its value will increase in a far greater ratio 
than that of the increase in subscriptions. It is the duty 
of every large library in the country to further this en- 
terprise by making use of the cards and by assuming 
some share, however small, of the work of preparation. 

The London " Athenaeum," celebrating on the first of 
January its seventieth birthday, seized the occasion as a 
pretext for an extremely interesting retrospective re- 
view. The history of the paper has been one of remark- 
able unity and consistency, owing to the fact that since 
the third year of its existence it has been owned by 
successive members of the same family, holding to the 
same literary and ethical principles. It did yeoman 
work in its early years in fighting to the death " the 
dragon of trade criticism," and it proudly boasts that it 
has ever remained independent of publishing and log- 
rolling influences, that it has never succumbed to the 
vicious practices of puffery, or "smart" writing, or 
sensational enterprise. The most interesting feature of 
this retrospective article is provided by the extracts 
from early files of the paper which serve to show that 
the " Athenaeum," in its contemporary judgments upon 
such men as Tennyson, Wordsworth, Shelley, Coleridge, 
Keats, and Moore, expressed substantially the opinions 
that are now universally accepted. We congratulate our 
English contemporary upon its years, its record for 
honest dealing, and its proud preeminence among its 
rivals living or dead.

THE MASTERY OF MEMORISING. 

THE GREATEST MEN IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY have had 
remarkable memories. A slight investigation will show that the 
most successful business men are possessed of wonderful memories. 
The training of the memory should be the basis of education. The 
demands of commercial life are daily becoming more onerous : more 
details must be mastered, more facts and figures remembered. Only 
the possessor of a powerful memory can win and hold a chief position 
in the world of work. Price, $1.00. Postpaid on receipt of price.

HOW TO SEE THE POINT AND PLACE IT. 

Punctuation Without Rules of Grammar. 

A book of forty pages which teaches punctuation rapidly by example. 
Many people who have studied English, Latin, and Greek grammar are 
very careless and slovenly punctuators. This book is indispensable to 
all writers. Memorising rules and exceptions wastes time and they are 
soon forgotten. Also gives rules for placing capital letters and italics, 
and preparing manuscripts for publication. By mail, 20 cts. 

LACONIC PUBLISHING CO., 123 Liberty St., New York. 

400 Recitations and Readings. 

A handsome book containing 400 of the best Recitations ever issued, 
designed for use in Parlor Entertainments, Reading Clubs, Day and 
Sabbath Schools, Adult and Juvenile Temperance Organizations, Young 
People's Associations, and Family Reading.

PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICULAR 

As to the class of reading matter that goes into their homes, and realize the importance of admit- 
ting only such publications as maintain a high standard and elevated tone, are invited to try for 
1898 three periodicals which, in a city where commercial and material affairs have long held sway, 
are working in the interests of higher intelligence and culture, and have won a position in their 
respective fields second to none in America. These papers are: 

THE CHAP-BOOK. 

" Chicago's handsome CHAP-BOOK . . . has estab- 
lished itself as the most amusing, the most readable, of 
American literary periodicals. . . . THE CHAP-BOOK 
is to be congratulated on the intelligence, the freedom 
from prejudice, which marks its literary judgments, and 
on the fact that it can hold itself uninfluenced even before 
the greatest names in fiction." Kansas City Star. 



THE CHICAGO EVENING POST. 

" THE CHICAGO EVENIXG POST bears the same rela- 
tion to the Chicago press that The New York Evening 
Post bears to the press of that city that is to say, it 
is a daily paper of the highest class, and appeals for its 
constituency to the best classes of people, and is there- 
fore free from sensationalism and from any pandering 
to ignorance, prejudice, or vice." The Interior, Chicago. 



THE DIAL. 

" THE DIAL is the best and ablest literary paper in the country." John G. Whittier. 

" From every point of view, THE DIAL is unsurpassed by any other literary journal in England or America." 
Sir Walter Besant. 

To put these three papers within the reach of all who appreciate the desirability of seeing 
them regularly, the publishers have arranged

TO THE TEACHER. (Extract.) 

The Recitation. The purposes of the recitation should include 
more than a test of memory : they should include a comparison and 
discussion of facts acquired in the preparation of the lesson. At the 
beginning of the recitation a topic should be named and the pupil 
required to recite upon it without question or comment from the 
teacher. Such a method, if persisted in, will inevitably develope flu- 
ency and readiness of expression. Teachers ask too many questions 
questions that seriously interfere with the flow of thought and with 
its free expression. Such interference is without doubt the most 
serious defect of the average recitation. The best work lies in help- 
ing the pupil to get definite ideas and then to give these ideas clear 
expression in well-connected sentences. He will thus acquire more 
available knowledge and better mental training through the acquisi- 
tion of this knowledge. In other words, the language faculty and the 
logical faculty will each receive good training. 



Special stress laid upon the industrial and social develop- 
ment, with a lucid presentation of the powerful influence 
exerted by routes and modes of travel, soil, and climate. 

Prominence given to the characteristics of our great national 
leaders. 

Emphasis of the importance of the West and South in our 
national development. 

Pupils are led throughout to form high ideals of social duty. 

TO THE PUPIL. (Specimen.) 

1. What complaints did we make against England about searching 
American vessels and impressing American seamen ? What com- 
plaints did England enter against us ? 

2. How did England and France injure American commerce ? What 
was Jefferson's purpose in securing the passage of the Embargo 
Act ? What was the Embargo ? How did it affect American com- 
merce? 

3. Why were New England Federalists bitterly opposed to the Em- 
bargo ? How was their dissatisfaction increased during the war ? 
What recommendation did the Hartford Convention make ? Com- 
pare this recommendation with the Kentucky and Virginia resolu- 
tions of 1798 and 1799. You observe that even in 1814 true national 
feeling was not strong and deep in the United States. Name three 
results of the war. 

4. Learn well the story of the Star Spangled Banner's origin and then 
memorize the poem. Read again and again Drake's American 
Flag and Holmes's Old Ironsides. 



OUTLINES OF DESCRIPTIVE PSYCHOLOGY. 

By QEORQE TRUMBULL LADD, D.D., LL.D., Professor of Philosophy in Yale University. 8vo, 450 pages, $1.50 net. 

In spite of the fact that the last few years have witnessed the appearance of numerous works on Psychology, there still exists a need for 
a clear, concise, elementary, yet scholarly volume, adapted to classroom use in our higher institutions of learning, colleges, and normal schools. 
Dr. Ladd, who has won an international reputation by his many-sided ability as author and teacher, at the request of many friends has written 
a brief but thorough text-book of Psychology to meet the demands of the present situation. 

The unprecedented success of Professor Ladd's more advanced books, and of his "Primer of Psychology," insures widespread popularity 
for this opportune addition to the apparatus of psychological study. 

HORACE MANN and the Common School Revival in the United States. 

By B. A. HINSDALE, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor of the Science and Art of Teaching in the University of Michigan. 

(Great Educators Series.) 12mo, $1.00 net. 

Professor Hinsdale, the well-known authority on Pedagogy, in preparing this volume has rendered an important and lasting service to the 
cause of education. It is matter of history that our present national common school system is due very largely to the transforming influence 
exerted by Massachusetts' famous Secretary of Education. Mann's life, as told by Dr. Hinsdale, forms the basis of a spirited sketch of American 
educational development from the very beginning. To the professional educator, the value of such a unique historical and biographical sum- 
mary is beyond question.

PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICULAR 

As to the class of reading matter that goes into their homes are invited to try for a year three 
Chicago periodicals which occupy a position in their respective fields second to none in America. 



THE CHICAGO EVENING POST. 

" THE CHICAGO EVENING POST bears the same rela- 
tion to the Chicago press that The New York Evening 
Post bears to the press of that city that is to say, it 
is a daily paper of the highest class, and appeals for its 
constituency to the best classes of people, and is there- 
fore free from sensationalism and from any pandering 
to ignorance, prejudice, or vice." The Interior, Chicago. 

THE 



THE CHAP-BOOK. 

" Chicago's handsome CHAP-BOOK . . . has estab- 
lished itself as the most amusing, the most readable, of 
American literary periodicals. . . . THE CHAP-BOOK 
is to be congratulated on the intelligence, the freedom 
from prejudice, which marks its literary judgments, and 
on the fact that it can hold itself uninfluenced even before 
the greatest names in fiction." Kansas City Star. 



DIAL. 

THE DIAL is the best and ablest literary paper in the country." John G. Whiitier. 

" From every point of view, THE DIAL is unsurpassed by any other literary journal in England or America." 
Sir Walter Besant.

with Lord Tennyson's life fitly complete the memoir, which is the most notable publication of its season. 

" The chief worth of the book, of course, is its minute and illuminating portrayal of Tennyson himself. Its 
value is only less for the glimpses it affords of other men of his time. Both make it a biography that is likely to 
be more than the book of one year, or of two." Evening Transcript, Boston, Mass.

A TALE OF TWO CITIES. 

One of the most interesting as well as hopeful 
developments in the history of American public 
education is that offered by the schools of New 
York City under the enlightened regime of the 
past three years. Not so very long ago, the 
case of the public schools in the greatest of 
American cities seemed well-nigh hopeless. 
The inadequate provisions made for their sup- 
port, the dull routine into which their adminis- 
tration had fallen, the baleful influences of the 
pettiest sort of politics, and the seeming lack of 
public interest in the institution which should 
be the chief civic pride of every democratic 
community these were the causes that com- 
bined to make of the New York system a by- 
word in educational discussion, to teach the 
educator that the work done in almost any 
inland city of moderate size was more likely to 
yield methods deserving of imitation and praise 
than the work done in the metropolitan city of 
the continent. Teachers might look for inspi- 
ration to Cleveland or Minneapolis, even to 
Peoria or Kansas City, with some reasonable 
prospect of finding it ; to expect inspiration 
from the city of New York was only to suffer 
the most complete disillusionment. 

How these conditions have been changed 
under the reform administration of the past 
three years is a tale familiar enough to the few 
who make a business of keeping track of edu- 
cational movements, but to the many whose 
interest in education is general rather than pro- 
fessional the facts are as yet little known. They 
are set forth in summarized form by the editor 
of " The Educational Review " in the January 
issue of that invaluable periodical, and we make 
no apology for calling them to the attention of 
our readers. 

" Three years ago New York was governed by an 
antiquated and cumbrous school law. Divided respon- 
sibility, wheels within wheels, and a series of political 
catch-basins made the schools a splendid drill ground 
for inefficiency, jobbery, and personal 'pulls.' No 
administrative reform was possible until this system 
was abolished. To abolish it required not only a legis- 
lative enactment, but the support and approval of 
Mayor Strong. Everything that misrepresentation, 
political influence, and even threats, could do was done 
to change the Mayor's purpose. But he stood firm, 
and the reform school bill became a law. That, of 
itself, was a public service of the first magnitude. A 



102 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



second service, of equal importance, was performed by 
the Mayor in the high character and ability of nearly 
all of his appointments to the Board of Education. The 
result has been the summoning together of the most 
earnest, intelligent, and courageous body of men that 
has ever served the cause of public education in New 
York." 

This is the substance of what has been done 
in three years, largely through the instrumen- 
tality of the executive, and we doubt if a finer 
tribute has ever been paid to the retiring 
mayor of any great American city than is 
embodied in this richly-deserved praise of 
Mayor Strong for the performance of the 
most important part of his official duties. 
When will the American public recognize and 
take to heart the fact that absolutely nothing 
else that a mayor has to do is as important as 
the performance of his duties with relation to 
public education, that the surest test of a 
mayor's deserts is supplied by an examination 
of that part of his policy which is concerned 
with the schools of the city which he governs ? 

The summary of Dr. Butler from which we 
have already quoted proceeds to specify, under 
fifteen heads, the distinctive achievements of 
three years of enlightened educational admin- 
istration in New York. All of these achieve- 
ments are important, but three or four of them 
so overshadow the others that they must have 
nearly all of the space that we can give to the 
discussion. For this reason, we merely note in 
passing the extension of the kindergarten sys- 
tem, the establishment of truant and vacation 
schools, the preparation of a scientific course of 
study, the plans adopted for protection against 
contagious diseases, the reorganization of the 
study of music, and the introduction of manual 
training into all the schools. Important as 
these things all are, they are less deserving of 
our admiration than the work that has been 
done for secondary education, the ample pro- 
vision of new buildings, and the framing of 
a schedule of salaries that is at once rational 
and generous. It is because these three mat- 
ters are those which most press for attention in 
Chicago, besides being of the greatest intrinsic 
importance, that our remarks are entitled " A 
Tale of Two Cities," and that we have sought 
to draw a lesson from the example of our East- 
ern neighbors. 

The establishment of a series of high schools 
of the best modern type in New York removes 
the chief reproach under which that munici- 
pality has hitherto suffered. It has at last 
supplied itself with what every self-respecting 
civilized town having one per cent of the pop- 



ulation of New York has always regarded as a 
prime necessity of the public school system. 
And not only have these schools been estab- 
lished, but they have been so generously pro- 
vided for that they have been able to secure 
the services of able and experienced faculties, 
and may reasonably be expected to do the work 
proper to high schools in an efficient way. In 
Chicago, on the other hand, although the high 
schools have for forty years been a part of the 
educational system, they have tended to suffer 
more and more of late years from a newspaper 
criticism either ignorant or malicious, or both, 
which has resulted in the formation of a con- 
siderable body of public opinion either adverse 
to them altogether, or willing to accord them 
only a grudging support. The inducements 
which they offer to trained educators are much 
less than were offered twenty years ago, whereas 
the inducements offered in all other departments 
of the system have been materially increased 
during the period in question. The result has 
been the only possible one : the men of the type 
most needed in the high schools have left them, 
attracted by the larger inducements offered 
elsewhere, the general character of the work 
has declined, and the teaching force in the 
lower schools, which is mainly recruited from 
the young women who get their education in 
the secondary schools, has suffered to an extent 
not easily to be measured, but none the less 
unquestionable. The bare fact that an educator 
in the high schools of New York and Boston 
may receive a salary fifty per cent higher than 
is paid him in Chicago carries its own implica- 
tion. It seems a sordid way of looking at the 
situation, but the view is one that must be 
reckoned with. 

The question of salaries is, after all, one of 
the fundamental questions of educational ad- 
ministration, and the efficiency of any system 
must depend largely upon the way in which 
this question is settled. It is not solely a ques- 
tion of liberality, although in education, as else- 
where, it is possible to preach such effective 
sermons on " The Economy of High Wages " 
as we find, for example, in the last " Educa- 
tional Review." But quite as important as 
mere liberality, is the adoption of some rational 
plan for promotion, some plan which shall make 
it an object for teachers to do the best work of 
which they are capable, some plan which shall 
insure to merit its due reward and to incom- 
petency its just reproof. The question of the 
salaries paid to teachers in the lower grades in 
the Chicago schools has been violently agitated 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



103 



during the past two months, and the news- 
papers have day after day devoted columns to 
its consideration. Yet a careful study of all 
this discussion fails to reveal so much as a sug- 
gestion that teachers, like other people, should 
be rewarded according to the value of their 
work. Instead of any well-considered scheme, 
the old plan of wholesale promotions based upon 
length of service and nothing else is brought 
forward, and whoever has anything to say ar- 
gues either for the plan or against it, without 
seeming to have the least suspicion that all 
such plans are in their nature irrational. In 
this matter the example of New York is pecu- 
liarly instructive. *' A new and scientifically 
adjusted schedule of salaries, founded upon 
length of service and merit, has been framed. 
This schedule provides an average increase of 
seven and one-half per cent on the salary of 
every teacher now in the public-school system." 
It is not easy to classify several thousands of 
teachers in accordance with their merit, and 
possibly the New York method of doing it is 
not the best method possible, but the thing 
must be done somehow, for it involves the most 
vital problem of city school administration. 

During the last twelve years, bonds have 
been issued to the amount of thirty-three mil- 
lions of dollars for the purchase of school sites 
and the erection of school buildings in the city 
of New York. Chicago has issued no bonds 
for this purpose, since the Constitution of Illi- 
nois limits the city indebtedness to an amount 
long since reached, and all school expenses must 
be provided for by annual taxation. This has 
made it impossible for the Chicago schools to 
catch up, as those of New York have now done, 
with the growing population, and the expendi- 
ture for sites and buildings in the former city 
has been for the same period something like 
one-third of what it has been in the latter. The 
difficulty here encountered is one which calls 
for a legislative remedy. Since the future may 
not be mortgaged by an issue of bonds, the 
annual tax-levy must rise, and the Board of 
Education is here confronted with a statutory 
provision which, while allowing a generous levy 
for school buildings, restricts the levy for other 
educational purposes to the amount of two per 
cent of the assessed valuation of taxable prop- 
erty. Since the system of assessment in Chicago 
has fallen into so scandalous a condition that 
property is listed at an average of less than 
one-tenth of its real value, the possible educa- 
tional tax really amounts to less than two mills 
on the dollar, which is simply not enough to 



provide proper support for a great metropolitan 
system of schools. The situation in this respect 
has grown so desperate that a reform of some 
sort will be forced in the near future, but until 
Chicago can escape from the tangle of consti- 
tutional and statutory prohibitions that now 
impede its natural growth it must be content

work for education that has been accomplished

ED UCA TION OF WOMEN IN ENGLAND. 

The recent agitation at the University of Cam- 
bridge over the admission of women to degrees has 
again directed the attention of the academic world 
to a question which has been practically settled in 
the United States, but is still a burning one on the 
other side of the Atlantic. A brief sketch of the 
education which England provides for its girls and 
women may therefore be of interest. 

In order to understand the English educational 
system, it mast be borne in mind that the schools 
which correspond to our public schools and colleges 
are the only ones about which it is possible to col- 
lect any trustworthy statistics. The private schools, 
which educate the daughters of the aristocracy and 
to a large extent of the upper middle class, must 
be dismissed with the general observation that they 
have been very much improved of late years, and 
that the finishing schools for superficial accomplish- 
ments have for the most part raised their standards. 

I will first speak briefly of Elementary Educa- 
tion, which is the education provided by the Board 
and Voluntary schools for the youth of both sexes. 
Without going into a discussion of the complicated 
English school system, it suffices to say that the 
Voluntary and Board schools are the public schools 
of England in the American sense, and that the 
Voluntary schools are supported by grants from 
the royal treasury and by voluntary subscription, 
the Board schools by grants and a school-tax on 
private property. The child may or may not receive 
religions instruction in both these schools, according 
to the wish of its parents. Co-education scarcely 
exists in England, and the boys and girls are taught 
in separate classes. The curriculum is the same 
for both sexes, except that sewing is compulsory for 
girls. Reading, writing, and arithmetic are obliga- 
tory for all, to which some three of the following 
subjects must be added : English, geography, his- 
tory, singing, algebra, chemistry, domestic economy, 
French, cookery. The usual school age is from 
three, when children may enter the infant depart- 
ment, to thirteen. The law allows a child to leave 
school at eleven, and the half-time system prevails 
in many places. The Higher Grade schools con- 
tinue the course of instruction to sixteen or even

eighteen years, and it is stated that a majority of 
pupils in these continuation schools are girls. This 
is in brief the education which England gives the 
daughters of the people. 

The Secondary schools are not public in the 
American sense. They are the old endowed schools, 
like Eton and Harrow, and scores of others less re- 
nowned. The pious founders and benefactors of 
these schools, in many cases women, made no pro- 
vision for girls. In the Middle Ages, when most 
of these schools were founded, the education of girls 
was confined to the nunneries, although Miss Brem- 
ner, in her recent book entitled " Education of 
Women and Girls in Great Britain," tries to show 
that girls were not originally excluded from some 
of the endowments. According to her, they were 
shut out of the Secondary schools after the Refor- 
mation, which was unfriendly to female education. 
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
and the first half of the present century, the educa- 
tion of girls was in the hands of the "ladies' schools," 
where they received flimsy instruction in the " ac- 
complishments." In 1865 a royal commission, ap- 
pointed to examine boys' Secondary schools, inquired 
also into the condition of the girls' schools. The 
commission reported a lamentable state of affairs in 
these so-called finishing schools. 

About the time that the report of the commission 
appeared, several forces began to work toward the 
raising of the character of girls' secondary education. 
First among these forces are the Cambridge and 
Oxford local examinations, which, mainly through 
the efforts of a number of pioneer women, were 
opened to girls, the Cambridge examinations in 
1865 and the Oxford in 1870. The best schools 
entered into these examinations with enthusiasm, 
and were soon followed by many others that were 
obliged to improve their curricula and methods in 
order to keep the pace. The second force that con- 
tributed to this reformation was the work of the 
Endowed Schools Commission. Many of the old 
endowments that had been diverted from their origi- 
nal purposes were divided, and a part applied to the 
founding of girls' schools. Many of the wealthy 
city companies were induced to spend some of their 
accumulated funds on the education of girls, and 
many of the best girls' schools owe their existence 
to the generosity of these guilds. 

Almost simultaneously with the beginning of these 
reforms, several associations of women were formed 
throughout England, whose chief object was the 
improvement of women's education. The Girls' 
Public Day School Company was the outcome of 
one of these unions. This is an interesting example 
of the application of commercial methods to educa- 
tion. The company has been from the first a pay- 
ing concern, yielding to its stockholders a yearly 
dividend of five per cent. Profits above this amount 
are applied to the improvement of the schools. The 
company has thirty-six schools in different parts of 
the kingdom, which have as head mistresses and 
teachers excellent women of the new type. The 



buildings and equipment are up to the highest 
standard. The Church Schools Company, with 
definite Church teaching as a part of its constitution, 
is a similar institution. These Public Day schools, 
or High schools as they are often called, are demo- 
cratic in their tone, while many of the others are 
" class " schools in the English sense. The Ladies' 
College at Cheltenham, one of the pioneer schools 
for girls' secondary education, makes it a point that 
all pupils shall be daughters of professional men, or 
those who hold a certain social position. The fees 
of the Public Day schools range from 5 15s to 
9 9s, which closes them practically to the lower 
middle classes. For them there is no secondary 
education beyond what the Higher Grade Board 
schools offer. The best girls' secondary schools 
prepare for the university colleges, the pupils leav- 
ing when about eighteen or nineteen years old. 

We come now to Higher Education. What En- 
gland is doing in this field for women is of most 
interest to the foreigner, especially at the present 
time, when the recent events at Cambridge are 
still fresh in the mind. To the casual reader this 
agitation might give the impression that England, 
like Germany, is just awakening to the higher in- 
tellectual needs of women ; but such is not the case. 
The Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution, a 
great evening college in London, opened its doors 
to women in 1833, the same year that Oberlin sent 
out from the wilds of Ohio its call to young women. 
Fifteen years later, Queen's College, London, was 
founded, and was followed the next year by Bed- 
ford College, an undenominational institution. 

Miss Emily Davies, one of the chief pioneers in 
the cause, conceived the idea of founding a woman's 
college in connection with one of the old universi- 
ties, and in 1869 opened a house with six students 
at Hitchin, a country town not far from Cambridge. 
This was the humble beginning of Girton College, 
which in 1873 was removed to Girton, a village near 
Cambridge, from which it takes its name. With 
Newnham, it is the best known of all the English 
women's colleges. A visit to Girton is a part of the 
Cambridge visitor's programme. The college is 
situated two miles from the town, a wise precaution 
as its founders thought, but now a serious incon- 
venience. Flies are furnished to convey the stu- 
dents to and from the university lectures. The 
handsome building of red brick is situated in the 
midst of ample grounds, large enough for numerous 
tennis courts and a small golf course. The lawns 
are as carefully kept as the university " quads." 
There are accommodations for one hundred stu- 
dents, each girl having a study and a small bedroom. 
These little studies present as many aspects as there 
are different girls. The large pieces of furniture 
provided by the college are supplemented according 
to the taste of the occupant. The tea table is a 
prominent feature of each apartment. Girton has 
had in all 575 students, 370 of whom hold the 
" equivalent of a degree." Among the honor scholars 
are Miss Charlotte Scott, who took high rank among

the wranglers, and is now professor of mathematics 
at Bryn Mawr, and Miss Ramsay, the first classicist 
in 1887, who afterwards married the Master of 
Trinity College, the man who set her questions. 

Newnham College, close by Cambridge, was 
opened in 1871 by Miss Cloogh, a sister of the poet 
Clough, with six students. It has now grown to 
three halls, with rooms for 158 students. Newnham 
is undenominational, whereas Girton provides relig- 
ious services in accordance with the principles of 
the Church of England. The fees are also less, 
being seventy-five guineas at Newnham and a hun- 
dred at Girton. Newnham has also had her share 
of honors. In 1890 Miss Philippa Fawcett, daughter 
of the blind Postmaster-General of England, made 
herself famous by excelling the Senior Wrangler ; 
and since then Miss A. M. Johnson was, one year, 
the only person who passed the highest mathemati- 
cal examination given by the university. The per 
cent of honors at both Newnham and Girton is fully 
as high as at the men's colleges, while the average 
work of the women is on a higher level than that of 
the men. The two colleges have the same mode of 
government. They are presided over by a princi- 
pal, assisted by vice-principals, ladies of culture and 
social position, who do not, as a rule, take part in 
the instruction. Miss Helen Gladstone, daughter 
of the ex-premier, was until recently one of the 
presiding ladies at Newnham. The colleges under- 
take to furnish all the instruction necessary in fitting 
for the university examinations. This instruction 
is given by resident women lecturers and men from 
the university. Eleven out of the seventeen colleges 
which compose the University of Cambridge admit 
the women students to their lectures and laboratories. 

What is the relation between the women's col- 
leges and the university? An undergraduate is 
legally a member of the university before he takes 
his degree. The women never become members of 
the university. They have no rights whatever ; the 
privileges they now enjoy are mere favors granted 
by courtesy. In 1880 a great effort was made to 
have the university degrees opened to women. The 
result was the formal permission to women to take 
the honor examinations. Thus they are excluded 
from the mere pass examinations, which the ma- 
jority of the men choose. In 1887 the attempt was 
renewed, and the university refused even to con- 
sider the question. But the women insisted, and in 
1896 the matter came up again. The university 
appointed a committee of fourteen members to 
investigate the subject and report the next year. 
This is the famous Syndicate whose report stirred 
up such a hornets' nest in Cambridge circles last 
year. The Syndicate took great pains to gather evi- 
dence from different sources, and presented a volum- 
inous report to the University Senate. This report, 
which was signed by nine of the fourteen members 
of the Syndicate, was a compromise between the two 
factions. It recommended that the titles of the dif- 
ferent degrees of the University be conferred upon 
women who had fulfilled the required conditions. 



The word title was of the greatest significance ; 
women graduates were not to be made members of 
the University. The report called forth a storm of 
discussion. The intensity of "undergrad" feeling 
is shown by the fact that the students condemned the 
proposal by a vote of 1723 con to 446 pro. The final 
voting occurred May 21, 1897. Everybody knows 
the result a refusal by three votes to one, said to 
be largely the work of country clergymen who 
flocked to Cambridge from all quarters to show their 
disapproval of this new sign of progress. Here it 
is to be observed that all graduates of the Univer- 
sity who have taken the degree of Master of Arts 
compose, ex~officiis, the Senate, and have the right 
to vote on all subjects submitted to that body. 
Among the reasons for refusal, two are prominent : 
Cambridge is a university for men, the admission of 
women would spoil its unique character, senti- 
mental reason ; opening the degrees to women would 
lead eventually to their sharing in the endowments, 
practical reason. 

As a balm for the wound thus inflicted, a number 
of prominent opposers have suggested a women's 
university with powers to grant specific women's 
degrees. One proposition is that the existing royal 
Holloway College, at Egham, be incorporated as the 
Queen Victoria University for Women. Bat the 
women do not want this ; they wish to enjoy the 
peculiar advantages of the two great universities. 
They also wish a degree in recognition of their work, 
and this is all they ask. 

The situation at Oxford is much the same as at 
Cambridge. The women have their halls of resi- 
dence, and are allowed to take the examinations, 
but the University grants them no certificates. The 
proposal to admit women to the B.A. degree was 
brought before the authorities in 1896, and rejected 
by a vote of 215 to 140. The new universities have 
been more liberal than the two ancient foundations. 
The University of London makes no distinction be- 
tween men and women. Victoria University follows 
the example of London. Durham excludes women 
from divinity. The University of Wales, all the uni- 
versities of Scotland and the Royal University of Ire- 
land grant degrees to women. Dublin refuses them. 

Coeducation in England deserves a word. The 
Voluntary and Board schools separate the boys and 
girls, and all private schools do the same as a matter 
of course. A very few secondary schools are trying 
the experiment of coeducation. The university col- 
leges that is, those colleges in different parts of the 
kingdom which prepare for the London, Durham, 
and Victoria examinations are using the joint- 
class system. University College, London, and a few 
others, exclude women from the medical department. 

This brief sketch sufficiently shows that England 
has not been illiberal in meeting the demands of 
women for the higher education. Cambridge and 
Oxford refuse to share with them, but there are still 
several institutions in the United States which show 
the same spirit. ELLEN C. HINSDALE.

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN INDUSTRIAL 

AFFAIRS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a review, by Mr. R. C. H. Catterall, of the book on 
" Industrial Freedom," printed in your last issue, I find 
the following: 

"The pleasing assumption that by legislative process we 
can give to the poor a greater share of the product of capital 
and labor, while not diminishing the aggregate production, 
ought to reveal its inherent absurdity in the mere statement." 

I suppose I am warranted in assuming that by the 
term " the poor " is here meant, not the pauper nor the 
chronic unemployed, but the class that economists call 
the "proletariat"; and I think I can show, if I may, 
one or two reasons why the inherent absurdity of the 
pleasing assumption referred to has not yet forced itself 
upon legislators and others. 

Mr. Thorold Rogers, in his " Six Centuries of Work 
and Wages," pays particular attention to a certain law, 
enacted during the reign of Edward III., called the 
Statute of Laborers. It remained, we are told, prac- 
tically a dead letter until the time of Elizabeth, when 
the justices in Quarter Session were empowered to fix, 
at stated periods, the rate of wages in husbandry and 
the handicrafts. This law was enforced, and, in the 
opinion of Mr. Thorold Rogers, it was one of the three 
great causes which induced pauperism in England, and 
brought the laborer down from the position where he 
could earn a year's stock of food in fifteen weeks to the 
position where a year's labor, Sundays included, would 
hardly do it. Even allowing for Mr. Rogers's well- 
known radicalism, it is hardly to be denied, by readers 
of his book, that the legislative process which resulted in 
abolishing this method of fixing wages resulted also in 
giving to the laborer a greater share than before of the 
product of capital and labor, and, instead of diminishing 
the aggregate production, actually increased it. 

Legislative process in England has also resulted in 
the freedom of laboring men to organize for the purpose 
of collective bargaining with their employers; and there 
are those who will claim that trades unionism, which 
has undeniably given the laborer a greater share of the 
proceeds of industry, has not diminished the aggregate 
production. 

Finally, if we may (economically) class the writers of 
philosophic books as members of the proletariat, I should 
like to call attention to certain " Views Concerning 
Copyright," promulgated by Mr. Herbert Spencer, and 
recently printed in a book called " Various Fragments," 
issued by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. Mr. Spencer was 
then, and apparently is still, of the opinion that the leg- 
islative process called the Copyright Law has resulted 
in reducing the prices of such books as his own, and has 
given to the writers of such books a better return in 
money for their labors, increasing the aggregate pro- 
duction at the same time by encouraging philosophers to 
still more superhuman efforts to get readers. 

Those, therefore, who persist in the "inherent ab- 
surdity " of assuming that legislation may, under certain 
circumstances, beneficially influence the relations be- 
tween capitalist and laborer, are not to be harshly con- 
demned, but gently labored with, to the end that they 
may abandon the heresies of Mr. Thorold Rogers and 
Mr. Herbert Spencer.

SOME FURTHER INSTANCES OF " TOTE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of January 16, a correspondent asks for 
information in regard to the word "tote"; and in re- 
sponse I beg to submit the following. 

In 1781 President Witherspoon remarked upon the 
use of the word in this country. In 1806 Webster ad- 
mitted it to his " Compendius Dictionary," labelling it 
"Virg. &c." In 1809 a writer believed it to be of 
Massachusetts origin, but gave no evidence in support 
of such a belief. In " The Nation " of February 15, 
1894, Mr. P. A. Bruce cited (under date of 1677) the 
earliest example of the word yet adduced, and pointed 
out that the smallness of the negro population at that 
time " would render improbable the supposition which 
has been sometimes advanced that the word had its 
origin with the negro race in this country " (p. 121). 
In the same paper a correspondent asserted that the 
word was " used in middle England, southern Yorkshire, 
and Lincolnshire, in exactly the same way that it is used 
in eastern Virginia." In 1894 Mr. Edward Eggleston 
called attention to the term " tote road," employed in 
Maine. The citations which follow prove for the first 
time, so far as the present writer is aware, that " tote " 
has had at least a casual use in New England for over 
a century and a quarter. 

" A complaint against Major Robert Beverly, that when this 
country had (according to order) raised 60 men to be an out- 
guard for the Governor : who not finding the Governor nor 
their appointed Commander they were by Beverly commanded 
to goe to work, fall trees and mawl and toat railes." 1677, 
"Virginia Magazine of History and Biography " (1894), II. 168. 

" On Monday Evening the Baronet [i. e. Governor Bernard] 
. . . sneaked down to Castle- William, where he lay that 
Night. The next Morning he was toated on board the Rippon, 
in a Canoe, or Tom-Cod Catcher, or some other small Boat." 

1769, "Boston Gazette," 7 August, 3. 

" The fourth class of improprieties consist of local phrases 
or terms. By these I mean such vulgarisms as prevail in one 
part of a country and not in another. ... 7. Tot is used for 
carry, in some of the southern states." 1781, J. Witherspoon, 
"Works" (1802), IV. 469-470. 

" We had taken the wrong road, and the Indian had lost us. 
He had very wisely gone back to the Canadian's camp, and 
asked him which way we had probably gone, since he could 
better understand the ways of white men, and he told him 
correctly that we had undoubtedly taken the supply road to 
Chamberlain Lake (slender supplies they would get over such 
a road at this season). The Indian was greatly surprised that 
we should have taken what he called a 'tow' (i.e., tote or 
toting or supply) road, instead of a carry path, that we had 
not followed his tracks, and said it was ' strange,' and evi- 
dently thought little of our woodcraft." 1857, H. D. Thoreau, 
"Maine Woods" (1894), 296-297. 

" Will the Atlantic Club have Dom Pedro as its guest ? It 
has occurred to me that he would like it better than being 
toted about, looking at Boston public buildings." 1876, J. G. 
Whittier, in "Life and Letters" (1894), II. 621. 

" ' Tote ' has long been regarded as a word of African ori- 
gin, confined to certain regions where negroes abound. A few 
years ago Mr. C. A. Stephens, in a story, mentioned an ' old 
tote road ' in Maine. I wrote to inquire, and he told me that 
certain old portage roads, now abandoned, bore that name. 
[Here is cited the quotation above dated 1677.] . . . ' Tote ' 
appears to have been a well-understood English word in the 
seventeenth century. It meant then, as now, to bear. Bur- 
lesque writers who represent a negro as ' toting a horse to 
water ' betray their ignorance. In Virginia English, the negro 
' carries ' the horse to water by making the horse ' tote ' him."

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.* 

In a noble quarto volume, conceived upon 
a plan and executed in a method commensurate 
with its own character and dignity, the Smith- 
sonian Institution presents the history of its 
inception and organization, and of its achieve- 
ments during the first half-century of its life. 
While engaged in the preparation of this vol- 
ume, two of its editors in succession, Dr. James 
C. Welling, a Regent, and Dr. G. Brown Goode, 
Assistant Secretary of the Institution, passed 
into the silent land ; but the work which one 
had planned the other so nearly completed that 
it is issued almost without change as he left the 
manuscript. The thirty chapters which make 
up the history bear the signatures of leading 
specialists who have builded their own fame 
while serving " in the increase and diffusion of 
knowledge among men." 

In all respects the Smithsonian Institution 
has a peculiar history. James Smithson, its 
founder, born in 1765, was the son of Elizabeth 
Keate Macie, a widow, a kinswoman of the 
Duke of Somerset, through whom she was 
descended from Henry Seventh of England. 
His father, Hugh Smithson, failing in his 
pledges to her, married her cousin, Elizabeth 
Percy, and became the Duke of Northumber- 
land. Permission to assume the name of 
Smithson was granted to the son by Parlia- 
ment, after the death of his mother. He in- 
herited the most of his property through his 
mother, from her son by a former marriage. 
The circumstances of his birth were bitterly 
remembered by James Smithson. He wrote : 

" The best blood of England flows in my veins. On 
my father's side I am a Northumberland, on my moth- 
er's I am related to kings; but this avails me not. My 
name shall live in the memory of man when the titles of 
the Northumberlands and the Percys are extinct and 
forgotten." 

Smithson was graduated as Master of Arts 
from Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1786, and 
was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society in 
1787, as " a gentleman well versed in natural 
philosophy, and particularly in chemistry and 
mineralogy," Cavendish being one of his spon- 
sors. He contributed freely to the Philosoph- 
ical Transactions and to the Annals of Phil- 
osophy. Two hundred manuscripts of his, with 
a large mass of detached notes and memoranda,

of its First Half Century. Edited by George Brown Goode.

were brought to the United States and deposited 
at the Smithsonian Institution, where all the 
originals were destroyed by fire in 1865. 

He died in Genoa, Italy, June 27, 1829. He 
was never married. He bequeathed his estate 
to his nephew, and to the children of his nephew 
if there should be any. Should the nephew die 
without children and intestate, then the estate 
should revert to "the United States of America, 
to found at Washington, under the name of 
the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment 
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge 
among men." The nephew died without issue 
in 1835. 

The proposed gift of Smithson was first pub- 
licly announced in the United States by Presi- 
dent Jackson, in a message to Congress, dated 
December 17, 1835. It was formally accepted 
by an act of Congress, approved July 1, 1836. 
Ten years later the corporation or Establish- 
ment of the Smithsonian Institution was created 
by an act approved August 10, 1846. The 
act confided the management to prominent 
officers of the national government. The statu- 
tory members of the corporation are the Presi- 
dent of the United States, the Vice-President, 
the Chief Justice, and the eight secretaries who 
form the President's cabinet. Subordinate to 
this corporation is the active Board of Regents, 
charged with the duty of conducting the busi- 
ness of the Institution. This Board consists of 
the Vice-President and the Chief Justice, with 
three members of the Senate, three of the House 
of Representatives, and six citizens, no two of 
whom may be citizens of the same State, but 
two must be residents of the city of Washing- 
ton. The list of those who have served as 
Regents in the fifty years which have passed 
includes representative and distinguished men 
from every section of the nation, and their 
character is a sufficient explanation of the In- 
stitution's success. 

The Regents elect a Secretary and clothe 
him with authority as their executive officer. 
He is charged with the disbursement of the 
funds of the Institution, is the custodian of its 
property, its librarian, and the curator of its 
museum. The office of Secretary of the Smith- 
sonian Institution is doubtless the most dis- 
tinguished and responsible position to which an 
American scientist may aspire. Three persons 
have occupied this position in the half-century. 

The first Secretary, serving from 1846 to 
1878, in fact the organizer of the Institution, 
was Joseph Henry. Born in 1799, Henry be- 
came first known in 1827 by investigations

which he pursued while a teacher in an academy 
at Albany, N. Y. His first great gift to science 
was the electro-magnet, made by winding a 
conducting wire about a core of soft iron, and 
available at places remote from the source of 
excitement. This discovery, made in 1829 or 
1830, was the one step needed to make tele- 
graphy possible. By the consensus of scien- 
tists, American and foreign, Henry was declared 
to be the one man to whom the organization of 
the new Institution should be committed. In 
1850, Spencer Fullerton Baird was appointed 
to aid Henry as Assistant Secretary. Henry 
was distinctively a physicist ; Baird was a natu- 
ralist. In those days Congress was sending 
numerous parties to explore the but partially 
known areas which lay between the Mississippi 
River and the Pacific. All such parties were 
accompanied by naturalists, who returned laden 
with collections in every scientific specialty, 
and these collections were by law deposited with 
the Smithsonian Institution for examination, 
classification, and report. For the supervision 
of this work Professor Baird was eminently 
fitted, as was shown in his own work upon the 
birds of the United States, a quarto volume of 
more than a thousand pages. In 1871 the 
Fish Commission was organized, and Professor 
Baird was placed at its head. In 1878 he 
was elected to succeed Professor Henry as 
Secretary. Dr. G. Brown Goode, who had 
assisted in both offices, was appointed Fish 
Commissioner, the two offices thus being sepa- 
rated. 

Through the agency of Professor Baird, a 
large part of the scientific material exhibited 
in 1876 at Philadelphia was transferred to the 
National Museum. To house this collection 
properly, a building of large capacity, although 
not architecturally pretentious, was erected upon 
a site adjacent to that of the Smithsonian In- 
stitution; and the two enterprises, though nomi- 
nally distinct, have for some years been under 
the same management. Professor Baird passed 
away in 1887. He had already appointed 
Samuel Pierpont Langley, then director of the 
Allegheny Observatory, to be First Assistant 
Secretary, and during the same year Professor 
Langley became the third Secretary of the 
Smithsonian Institution. 

Professor Langley's fame rested chiefly upon 
the progress which he had made in astrophysical 
research directed especially to solar phenomena. 
His bolometer, an instrument of infinite deli- 
cacy, measured the minutest variations of tem- 
perature by their influence upon an electrical 



current indicated by a galvanometer. To this 
was added the holograph, which photographi- 
cally recorded the movements of the galvan- 
ometer needle. By means of this apparatus 
knowledge of the solar spectrum, and particu- 
larly of its invisible portions, has been greatly 
increased. Professor Langley has also studied 
with great care the phenomena of aerial loco- 
motion. 

The funds received from the Smithson estate 
amounted originally to $550,000. By the ad- 
dition of accrued interest and savings, this sum 
has been increased to more than seven hundred 
thousand dollars. Within a few years, dona- 
tions amounting to more than a quarter of a 
million dollars have been added directly, so that 
the sum now lying to the credit of the endow- 
ment fund, mostly in the treasury of the United 
States, amounts to nearly one million dollars. 
With the proceeds of this fund the operations 
of the Institution are mainly supported. It has 
also been the recipient, indirectly, of large na- 
tional subsidies, and of abundant favors at the 
hands of railway, steamship, and other corpo- 
rations, and it has secured the aid of an army 
of professors and students, who have given 
freely their labor, looking for no compensation 
beyond the honor of its recognition and their 
own love for science. 

The will of Smithson directed that the pro- 
ceeds of his bequest should be used " for the 
increase and diffusion of knowledge among 
men." In his " Plan of Organization " Pro- 
fessor Henry noted clearly that the terms " in- 
crease " and " diffusion " are logically distinct, 
and he urged that each should receive its literal 
interpretation ; and 

" That the increase of knowledge should be effected 
by the encouragement of original researches of the 
highest character, and its diffusion by the publication of 
the results of original research. . . . That if preference 
be given to any branches of research, they should be to 
the higher and more abstract, to the discovery of new 
principles rather than of isolated facts." 

He would have the Institution do nothing 
which could be equally well done through other 
agencies. He believed that local objects, as 
museums, libraries, and lectures, should not be 
supported by the Institution, and strongly op- 
posed the erection of a costly building. He 
was not satisfied until the money which had 
been so used was by careful economy restored 
to the fund. He had the satisfaction, before 
he died, of seeing the library, which was becom- 
ing cumbersome, transferred to the Congres- 
sional Library ; the Weather Bureau transferred 
to the War Department; the National Museum

supported by direct appropriations, and the 
resources of the Institution left comparatively 
free to be used for what he conceived to be its 
exclusive purpose. 

The series of papers included in this History, 
prepared by specialists in the various fields cul- 
tivated under the auspices of the Smithsonian 
Institution, show with what broad catholicity 
the fundamental principles laid down by Henry 
have been interpreted and applied by the suc- 
cessive secretaries. The work of research is 
necessarily complemented by that of diffusion. 
Something must be learned before it can be 
told ; when thoroughly known, it cannot be told 
too soon nor distributed too widely. Hence 
the Smithsonian motto, PER OEBEM. Its fields 
of investigation have been world wide ; its sub- 
sidies have been granted whenever there has 
been reasonable assurance that they would aid 
in extending the boundaries of human knowl- 
edge. The realm of pure science was one of the 
earliest to be occupied, in mathematics, physics, 
and their applications in astronomy, geography, 
and especially in the development of electrical 
science. The public generally, and men of 
science too frequently, in view of the later and 
more brilliant achievements of Morse and Bell 
and Edison, forget that the prolific source of 
all this subsequent progress was opened by the 
discoveries which Henry made or fostered. 

But the first two secretaries were not slow 
to discern that a special opportunity lay before 
the new Institution, one which must be seized 
promptly and pursued vigorously, or it would 
forever vanish. A vast area of virgin country 
lay between the great river and the western 
sea. Its surface had not been carefully ex- 
plored, even geographically. Beneath it were 
unknown stores of minerals, precious and econo- 
mic. Above it plant and animal life adapted 
to horizons and conditions indefinitely varied. 
From one boundary to its opposite, this land 
was strewed with the relics of one people sup- 
posed to have quite faded away, and with the 
scanty possessions of another race whose dis- 
appearance could not be remote. Over this 
country the wave of settlement was already 
rising with a resistless surge. In a few decades, 
the Indian, with his customs, his homes, and 
his implements, the buffalo and the grizzly, the 
seal and the salmon, the forest and the prairie 
flower, would have vanished before the white 
man's constructive and destructive march. The 
decade beginning with 1850 showed great ac- 
tivity in explorations. These were usually un- 
dertaken for some purpose of national economy, 



as the determination of a boundary, the location 
of a railway, or the fixing of geodetic positions ; 
but the Smithsonian Secretary took care that 
each should be accompanied by an efficient 
corps of scientific observers and collectors, and 
that the abundant harvests which these gath- 
ered should be discussed by competent experts. 
Thus were these explorations made to assist the 
increase of knowledge. 

To make this knowledge effective and endur- 
ing, two further movements were necessary. 
The first provided for the preservation of the 
material thus carefully investigated, and essen- 
tially correlated to the knowledge acquired. 
Hence arose the necessity for a Museum which 
should be national, both as to the source from 
which its contents should be gathered, and as 
to the completeness of its accumulations. A 
real museum is not a mere curiosity shop, but 
is a mass of carefully chosen material, scientifi- 
cally determined and systematically arranged. 
It is a means of giving to knowledge a concrete 
and crystalized identity, freed from the jug- 
glery of phrases. It is a conservator of science. 
As it must have a local habitation, its utility is 
localized, yet its influence extends per orbem. 
In this view the National Museum must be 
recognized as the coadjutor to and the supple- 
ment of the legitimate Smithsonian work. The 
National Park is only a department of the 
Museum, adapted to living exhibits. A library, 
properly selected, becomes part of the appa- 
ratus of scientific investigation. What more 
than this had once been accumulated has found 
a more suitable home with the National Library. 
So, also, have some elements of an Art Gallery 
been transferred to the Corcoran collection. 

The duty of the diffusion of knowledge is 
fulfilled in the varied issues of Smithsonian 
publications. Beginning with 1846, the Insti- 
tution issued an annual report showing its con- 
ditions and operations, and from 1849 these 
reports gave account of the progress of knowl- 
edge in the world. Since 1889 the issue of these 
reports has been discontinued. The " Smith- 
sonian Contributions to Knowledge " con- 
sist of thirty-two volumes of quarto form. To 
these volumes nothing may be admitted " which 
does not furnish a positive addition to human 
knowledge resting on original research ; all 
unverified speculation to be rejected." A third 
series in octavo, now of thirty-eight volumes, 
bears the title " Smithsonian Miscellaneous 
Collections." Much of the material so issued 
has been recast into forms especially useful to 
scientists who are making collections or con-

ducting investigations. A series of proceedings 
issued by the National Museum is now in its 
nineteenth volume. The Museum has also 
issued many bulletins and circulars of instruc- 
tion. The Bureau of American Ethnology 
issues separate series of publications. 

As another means of distribution of knowl- 
edge, the Smithsonian Institution has estab- 
lished within itself a bureau of exchanges, by 
means of which American scientific materials 
may be distributed to European societies, and 
foreign books, instruments, etc., may be dis- 
tributed in this country, usually without cost. 

In conclusion, it may be asserted that, con- 
sidering the character of those who at all times 
have been the managers or the administrators of 
the Smithsonian bequest ; the variety, breadth, 
and scope of the interests fostered thereby ; the 
amount of the work accomplished as well as its 
preeminent quality the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion reflects the highest honor upon its donor, 
upon science, and upon the American people.

A NOBLE WOMAN'S WORK FOB 
WOMAN'S EDUCATION.* 

Perhaps no social movement of the time has 
made such rapid strides as the higher educa- 
tion of women. So closely has achievement 
pressed upon the heels of effort that even those 
who are to the manner born find it difficult to 
keep the pace. Necessarily the history is varied 
and complicated, so that a clear presentation 
of one phase of it, such as Miss B. A. Clough 
has given in her pleasing Memoir of her aunt, 
late Principal of Newnham College, is most 
welcome. 

Anne Jemima Clough was born January 20, 
1820, in Liverpool, where her father, of an old 
Welsh county family, had established himself 
as a cotton merchant. This business brought 
him to the United States, and in 1822 he 
removed his family to Charleston, which was 
their home for the next fourteen years. 
Anne's childhood was thus passed in an Ameri- 
can Southern city ; and a happy childhood it 
was, as she described it in the reminiscences 
contributed, in 1869, to the memoir of her 
brother, Arthur Hugh Clough. Their home 
was an ugly red brick house on the East Bay, 
from whose nursery windows the children could

see the ships sailing in and out of the harbor. 
Below stairs was their father's office, where 
they played among the heaps of cotton. 
" Arthur used to do sums in the office lying on 
the piled-up pieces of cotton bagging." Miss 
Clough retained the liveliest memories of her 
early years in the Southland a striking trait 
of character is shown by the fact that she cor- 
responded with one of her Charleston friends 
for the rest of her life, a period of fifty-six 
years. 

The doughs were too English to let their 
children go to school in Charleston, so the 
three boys were sent to England to be edu- 
cated ; but beyond lessons from her mother, 
Anne Clough had no instruction. She never 
went to school. Upon her return to England, 
in 1836, Miss Clough eagerly sought every 
means of acquiring knowledge. A journal 
kept at this time describes vividly the difficul- 
ties and disappointments she met with. There 
were then few opportunities of education for 
girls except in incoherent lessons from masters, 
and Miss dough's father was not able to pro- 
vide private tuition for her. Indeed, it is 
clear that she felt thus early the necessity of 
doing something for herself, for she seems to 
have begun, in her seventeenth year, to visit 
and teach in a Welsh National School which her 
father had helped to found. The Journal tells 
of her ups and downs in teaching, of the books 
she read, and of her relations to her brother 
Arthur. At one time she is getting up at six 
o'clock to study before going to her school ; she 
had stinted herself to do in a month, 

" One book of Euclid, as far as the 80th page, in the 
Greek grammar, translate book ii. of Virgil from the 
German, read 2nd and 3rd volumes of Milman's His- 
tory of the Jews, Milton over again, and the second vol- 
ume of Wordsworth." 

Another entry, January, 1844, is : 

"Have been reading Trench's poems, which are 
beautiful, also in the last year Moultrie's and Tenny- 
son's, some of Shakspere's plays, The Last of the 
Barons (a disagreeable book), The Hour and the Man, 
Lives of Celebrated Scotchmen, some of Cowper, a few 
of Newman's sermons, and Arnold's; the last, the new 
volume, are beautiful." 

It was Arthur Clough who had brought to 
her from Oxford the poems of Moultrie and 
Tennyson. She had a quite special affection 
and admiration for this brother, whom she 
calls her " best friend and adviser." He dis- 
cussed with her questions large and small, now 
disestablishment or eternal punishment, and 
now the best way to treat a case of pilfering 
among her poor children. He realized the un-

ill 



rest of her life, her longing for some adequate 
outlet for her pent-up energies ; and for this 
reason he encouraged her work among the 
poor. But he thought her ardor in this direc- 
tion excessive, and he seems to have had little or 
no conception of her peculiar ability. This is 
what he wrote to her about her studies : 

" I will consider the subject you speak of, my dear. 
On the whole, I should incline to study arithmetic and 
grammar, perhaps; but you must remember that a 
great advantage is given by any sort of cultivation 
(music, drawing, dancing, German, French, etc.) for 
intercourse with the poor." 

It was happily said during the recent contest 
for degrees for women in Oxford, " if there 
is any peculiar affinity between French and 
music, often badly taught, and the minds of 
women, it has never been demonstrated by the 
advocates of the fine-lady type of education." 
Miss Clough continued to grope about for an 
opportunity of giving practical shape to her 
ideas. Of her own education she writes : " I 
always feel the defects of my education most 
painfully when I go out." Her lack of train- 
ing for her work she sought to correct by 
attending one or two different training schools 
in London. Among her brother's friends 
whom she met there was Francis Turner Pal- 
grave, of whom she says : 

" I wondered to hear Mr. Palgrave talk about 
women as if only those like Lady Maria in Arthur's 
story are to be admired. I don't much fancy men 
often understand women ; they don't know how restless 
and weary they get." 

The result of Miss Clough's studies in teach- 
ing was the establishment, at Ambleside, West- 
moreland, of a school for the children of trades- 
people and farmers. This school she conducted 
successfully for the ten years from 1852 to 
1862 ; and it was what she learned here of the 
defects of Middle-Class Education, especially 
for girls, that led finally to her great achieve- 
ments in advancing education for women in 
England. Her thoughts began to take definite 
form in a remarkable paper, entitled " Hints 
on the Organization of Girls' Schools," which 
she contributed to " Macmillan's Magazine," in 
October, 1866. This short paper contains in 
germ much that has since been done in England 
for the secondary and higher education of 
women. It described the inadequate state of 
girls' schools of all kinds, and attributed the 
evil in large measure to the fact that there was 
no standard by which schools for girls could be 
tested. A plan of improvement was then 
sketched out, which, curiously enough, has 
developed into two widely different results. 



It is not generally known that the whole 
scheme of University Extension originated 
with Miss Clough in a modest " hint " towards 
the betterment of girls' schools. The most 
striking idea in the paper was the suggestion 
of courses of lectures in large towns for girls 
and women, to be given by University men, 
with syllabuses and examinations. This sug- 
gestion was the origin of the association known 
as the North of England Council for Promot- 
ing the Higher Education of Women, which, 
in 1867, started courses of lectures for women 
in Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, and 
Leeds. The lectures succeeded from the first, 
and their establishment in the two University 
towns was the practical beginning of the 
women's colleges there. University Extension 
is the popularization of the movement. 

Another matter to which the North of 
England Council gave its attention turned out 
also to be of wider import than was at first 
intended. This was the establishment of a 
satisfactory examination for women over 
eighteen years of age, with the view especially 
of testing teachers. The University of Cam- 
bridge received favorably the memorial of the 
Council on this subject, and appointed a syn- 
dicate which drew up a scheme of examina- 
tions, to last provisionally for three years. At 
the end of that time the examinations were 
made permanent; and when, two years later, 
men applied for admission to them, the name 
was changed from Women's Examinations to 
the Higher Local Examinations. Since then 
the Higher Local has alternated with the his- 
toric Little Go as an entrance examination to 
the University, and it is considered the better 
test of the two, as based on modern conditions 
in education. 

With the growth of the University idea in 
this country, the affiliated college, whether as 
a school of medicine or law, or a school for 
women, has become familiar. It is not neces- 
sary to trace the history of Newnham College, 
from its small beginning, in 1871, as a rented 
house of residence for fine women attending 
private lectures, to its present commanding 
position. Women were first admitted of right 
to the Tripos Examinations in 1881 ; the 
Principal's Report for 1894, thirteen years 
later, states that Newnham College stood third 
in the University in the number of students 
who took honors. It was outranked only by 
St. John's and Trinity, the two largest colleges 
for men, both old and wealthy foundations. 

This is a great achievement ; but the unique 



112 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



personality of the woman who brought it 
about was even greater. In the first place, 
paradoxical as it may seem, Miss Clough was 
not naturally a student, nor even an intellec- 
tual woman. Though she had a strong sense 
of humor, her niece notes her insensibility to 
its intellectual forms, to humorous fancy, or to 
wit. She had great respect for learning, and 
sometimes expressed it in a wholly unexpected 
way, as when she said of a student who had 
been disappointed in not obtaining a high 
class in the Mathematical Tripos, "Mathe- 
matics is a deceiving subject." She was most 
of all interested in human life, and her devo- 
tion to education grew out of that. She looked 
upon education as the best possible preparation 
for life, and she saw no reason why women 
should not be prepared for the world's work as 
well as men. That was so simple to her own 
mind as to be axiomatic. 

Those who knew her sometimes wondered 
how a woman so practical and so optimistic 
could have been the sister of a poet who, with 
all his tenderness and humor, is commonly 
regarded as being introspective, sad, and skep- 
tical. While Arthur Clough seems to have 
been asking himself, doubtfully, whether there 
was " aught that was worth the doing," or the 
saying either, for that matter, her life was a 
continual assertion of the worth of doing, even 
in small things. But there was far more 
spiritual kinship between them than at first 
appears. Clough's mind ran mainly on moral 
and social questions. Mr. Humphry Ward 
says of him, that " it was the warmth of his 
feelings, the width of his sympathies, the fine- 
ness of his physical sensibilities that made him 
a poet," and that it was "his extraordinary 
union of sincerity and sympathy that most 
endeared him to his friends." Sympathy and 
sincerity were marked traits of character in 
Miss Clough. But hers was undoubtedly the 
stronger spirit. The " Ambarvalia," the 
" Amours de Voyage," all are pierced with the 
pain and mystery of life, for which the poet 
offers no alleviation and no solution. The 
passion that stirred the sister's life to rich 
fruition was the narrowness of the lives of 
women. She often spoke of the many new 
openings for women, and referred pathetically 
to what the young women of her own time had 
suffered from lack of training and opportunity. 
To a- friend who was impatient for happiness, 
she said gently : "You should not expect hap- 
piness, my dear ; I had to wait for mine till I 
was fifty." She was nearly fifty-two when she 



began her work at Newnham. Twenty-five 
years before, in 1846, her Journal records : 

" We [Arthur and Anne] had a great deal of con- 
versation about various things, principally about our 
future plans; the necessity, or rather the great benefit, 
of women finding work, and considering it a duty to do 
so, and also whether they are at liberty to choose their 
own paths in some cases (I mean single women), with- 
out reference to their families." 

And again: 

" Had various discussions about married and single 
life, and one long talk with Jane Claude about work- 
ing. Told her some of my notions about its being 
right in certain cases to quit even one's father and 
mother and family for work as well as for a husband." 

The quarter of a century during which 
these ideas had been revolving in her mind 
was one of great awakening in thought, and 
women had shared perforce the inheritance of 
men. Mary Carpenter and Florence Nightin- 
gale had opened up new lines of social activity 
for women ; Mrs. Browning and George Eliot 
had shown with renewed vigor that there is no 
sex in literature ; those women, like Charlotte 
Bronte and Mrs. Jameson and Harriet Mar- 
tineau and Mary Somerville, who advocated 
the political enfranchisement of women, had 
found a parliamentary leader of the first rank 
in John Stuart Mill. There could be no 
longer any doubt that a sound education is a 
good thing for a woman to have. What 
remained was to prove the feasibility of get- 
ting it ; and that, in England, involved bring- 
ing over the great universities to the novel 
idea that it is the business of a university to 
educate the human race. The selection of 
Miss Clough to perform this delicate and 
difficult task at Cambridge was due to the 
wisdom and foresight of Professor Henry 
Sidgwick, who knew the situation and the 
woman. Miss Clough disarmed criticism from 
the start. She was not learned, she was not 
aggressive ; she was so afraid of saying too 
much that she said very little ; she was an 
entirely inoffensive person. On the other 
hand, she had prestige, a quick intelligence, 
great powers of organization, unfailing tact, 
and an indomitable persistence. She gained 
no point by direct assault, but when an advan- 
tage fell in her way she was always ready to 
make the most of it, and she never lost ground. 
She herself expressed, with singular poetic in- 
sight, her own manner of working : 

" It seems to me that to be quiet and to be active, 
or, rather, to be quietly active, constantly going on 
with untiring energy, and yet so softly as scarcely to 
be perceptible, this seems to me to be an approach 
towards perfection. And this lesson we learn from 



1898.]

Nature, which is unceasingly and yet imperceptibly 
changing." 

This is precisely how her work impressed 
those who came to know it intimately, like 
that of Nature, so silent, gradual, barely per- 
ceptible, apparently unconscious it was. 

Innumerable little touches throughout the 
book restore Miss Clough to her students u in 
her habit as she lived." There is her busy 
mind overflowing with suggestions and expedi- 
ents of all sorts, sometimes whimsically impos- 
sible, but oftener the very best thing to do in 
any given circumstances. She had accumu- 
lated an inexhaustible fund of practical wis- 
dom, and her wide acquaintance with people 
enabled her to fit together the most diverse 
interests. For a student going to the Lake 
Country and expecting to take a certain walk 
over the fells, through a perfectly safe but 
rather wild region, she knew the last house on 
the road where definite information could be 
had for the rest of the way. She advised a 
party of students who proposed to spend a 
vacation travelling slowly through the south of 
England, to apply to the local postmasters for 
good lodgings, a plan that was found to work 
admirably well. She was a great believer in 
the benefit of change. She thought Wesleyan 
ministers " must get a wide view of the world 
and of people," and she suggested a similar 
interchange of cures between town and coun- 
try clergy. So she writes to a teacher, suffer- 
ing from the climate of India : 

"I wish some of our English women of leisure 
would undertake to do work abroad for a couple of 
years. ... I should like to make a circle of teachers 
moving round." 

She encouraged her students to undertake work 
in distant lands, if only for a few years ; and 
she was always delighted to receive foreign 
students at Newnham. Apart from the good 
they might gain, she thought they did good by 
bringing in fresh life and widening the other 
students' horizons. For American students 
she had a special regard ; her knowledge of 
American democracy was unusually intelligent, 
and she readily appreciated the savoirfaire of 
the American college women who came to her. 
Possibly it may have been sometimes that they 
seemed to possess the earth, as it had been in 
her own heart to do at their age. 

What she would have called " a useful little 
book " might be made by collecting her wise 
sayings, clothed always in simple, homely 
words ; for although her ideas were sometimes 
poetical, she had no gift of expression. Many 



such sayings are scattered throughout this book, 
and many more doubtless are to be had from 
her letters to her students. Some of the best 
of them here are on work. 

" There is great enjoyment in work. . . . Work puts 
us into connection with others, it gives us interest and 
experience, and scope for our affections." 

" If one can only do one's work well, one may bear 
anything." 

" Do not be afraid of humble work, whatever it may 
be. Take what comes and put your minds to it. But I 
advise you always to try for leisure, and contemplate 
your work, and avoid slavery." 

No one but Miss Clough could have summed 
up the good of a three years' University course 
with " My dear, you will be able to amuse them 
better when you go home," which, says the 
student, " is exactly what I had to try and do." 

Miss Clough died at Newnham College, 
February 27, 1892. Among the flowers that 
were laid on her grave, near that of Henry 
Fawcett, in Grantchester churchyard, were two 
wreaths that the Newnham women felt pecu- 
liarly grateful for. One came from Mr. Glad- 
stone and one from the aged poet Tennyson. 

The frontispiece of the present Memoir is an 
admirable picture of Miss Clough reproduced 
from a photograph by Mrs. Frederick W. H. 
Myers. It ought to be dated.

The educational unrest of the present is both 
an evil and a blessing. We think of it as a 
blessing when we realize how much more earn- 
estly than ever before the problems of teaching 
are being attacked, how many more high capaci- 
ties are being given to the work, how rational 
and effective have been some of our recent 
pedagogical advances. But the shield has an- 
other side, and current pedagogy may well 
seem little more than an evil to him who ob- 
serves the growing influence of shallow theor- 
ists and charlatans, the random experimentation 
done at the expense of thousands of luckless 
children, and the dreary flow of words without 
knowledge that gushes forth at so many an 
" educational " gathering and fills the pages of

so many a pedagogical periodical. These things 
make one look back longingly to a time when 
education was more human because less scien- 
tific, when it was conceived of as the contact of 
mind with mind rather than as the mechanical 
application of a system of pedagogy. 

The name of Thomas Arnold is deservedly 
famous in the history of education, but many 
of our modern educators are so " advanced" 
in their own conceit, so excited over the pos- 
session of the new toy which they call psychology, 
that they would doubtless find it surprising to 
be told, in all seriousness, that Arnold's atti- 
tude toward the fundamental problems of edu- 
cation was a more enlightened one than is easily 
to be found among educators of the present day. 
We do not express this opinion outright, but 
we assert that it is at least an arguable matter. 
Who in our own time, for example, has formu- 
lated a finer expression of the pedagogical ideal 
than may be found in this passage from a letter 
written by Arnold in 1836 to Mr. Justice 
Coleridge ? 

" I am sure that the more active my own mind is, and 
the more it works upon great moral and political points, 
the better for the school ; not, of course, for the folly 
of proselytizing the boys, but because education is a 
dynamical, not a mechanical, process, and the more 
powerful and vigorous the mind of the teacher, the more 
clearly and readily he can grasp things, the better fitted 
he is to cultivate the mind of another. And to this I 
find myself coming more and more : I care less and 
less for information, more and more for the pure exer- 
cise of the mind; for answering a question concisely 
and comprehensively, for showing a command of lan- 
guage, a delicacy of taste, and a comprehensiveness of 
thought and power of combination." 

We have made this extract from a volume 
recently edited by Mr. J. J. Findlay, a volume 
which ought to find its way into the hands of 
every teacher. It is entitled "Arnold of Rugby : 
His School Life and Contributions to Educa- 
tion." It contains, besides the editorial pre- 
face, an introductory chapter by the Bishop of 
Hereford, a biographical notice with extracts 
from Arnold's letters, a reprint of those sections 
of Stanley's " Life" which deal with the school 
work at Laleham and Rugby, a selection from 
the sermons preached by Arnold at Rugby 
Chapel, Arnold's miscellaneous essays on edu- 
cational topics, and a bibliography. In other 
words, the work supplies, within the compass 
of a single volume of moderate dimensions, the 
material for a very thorough knowledge of Ar- 
nold's educational methods and ideals. Narrow 
as Arnold was in some ways, and almost fanat- 
ical as he was in his insistence upon the injec- 
tion of dogmatic theology into his system of 



discipline, the study of his life-work cannot be 
other than inspiring, and it is easy to separate 
the dross of his pedagogical doctrine from its 
pure gold. In a famous passage, he once spoke 
of physical science in the following terms: 
" Rather than have it the principal thing in 
my son's mind, I would gladly have him think 
that the sun went round the earth, and that the 
stars were so many spangles set in the bright 
blue firmament." This is an extreme form of 
statement, but it embodies a fundamental prin- 
ciple of sound educational theory, and, what is 
just now more to the point, it illustrates the 
tenacity with which Arnold held to the essen- 
tials of his system. His conviction was abso- 
lute that some subjects are of more importance 
than others, and the case for the classics was 
never put more cogently than in the following 
sentences from an article written by Arnold in 
1834 for " The Quarterly Journal of Educa- 
tion ": 

" Expel Greek and Latin from your schools, and you 
confine the views of the existing generation to them- 
selves and their immediate predecessors: you will cut 
off so many centuries of the world's experience, and 
place us in the same state as if the human race had first 
come into existence in the year 1500. . . . The mind 
of the Greek and of the Roman is in all the essential 
points of its constitution our own; and not only so, but 
it is our own mind developed to an extraordinary degree 
of perfection. Aristotle, and Plato, and Thucydides, 
and Cicero, and Tacitus, are most untruly called ancient 
writers; they are virtually our own countrymen and 
contemporaries, but have the advantage which is en- 
joyed by intelligent travellers, that their observation 
has been exercised in a field out of the reach of com- 
mon men; and that having thus seen in a manner with 
our eyes what we cannot see for ourselves, their con- 
clusions are such as bear upon our own circumstances, 
while their information has all the charm of novelty, 
and all the value of a mass of new and pertinent facts, 
illustrative of the great science of the nature of civil- 
ized man." 

Essentially sound as were the chief positions 
maintained by Thomas Arnold during his career 
as an educator, they had, of course, accidental 
features that it would not be well to insist upon 
overmuch after the lapse of half a century. 
Fortunately, however, the name of Arnold was 
destined to be bound up with the history of 
English education for another generation, and 
the more famous son of the famous Master of 
Rugby was an example of the rare type of man 
who can recognize, with exquisite discernment, 
the legitimate demands of the Zeitgeist, while 
holding, in the main, to a well-approved con- 
servative ideal. Matthew Arnold's position in 
English literature was so distinguished that his 
admirers are apt to forget that the poet and 
critic was also an educator of the first rank,

and that a large share of his best activities was 
given to the inspection of schools, the marking 
of examination papers, and the preparation of 
those official reports which, while omitted from 
the uniform editions of his works, are never- 
theless to be reckoned among the classics of 
pedagogical literature. It is for calling re- 
newed attention to these writings that we are 
chiefly thankful to Sir Joshua Fitch, who has 
prepared for the " Great Educators " series a 
volume entitled " Thomas and Matthew Arnold 
and Their Influence on English Education." 
The book is written in a spirit of generous 
sympathy, and is pleasant reading from first to 
last. The chapters devoted to Arnold pere 
duplicate the substance of Mr. Findlay's com- 
pilation, and emphasize much the same aspects 
of Arnold's activity. The chapters that take 
up the work of Arnold fils afford a well-con- 
sidered and judicial estimate of the poet who 
was also an inspector of schools, and whet the 
appetite for his educational books by making 
many happy extracts from their pages. 

The spirit in which Arnold did his official 
work is made clear by such a statement as this : 

" If he saw little children looking good and happy, 
and under the care of a kindly and sympathetic teacher, 
he would give a favourable report, without inquiring 
too curiously into the percentage of scholars who could 
pass the ' standard ' examination. He valued the elemen- 
tary schools rather as centres of civilization and refin- 
ing influence than as places for enabling the maximum 
number of children to spell and write, and to do a given 
number of sums without a mistake." 

Of peculiar interest is Arnold's reported opin- 
ion concerning the " Tom Brown " view of 
school life at Rugby. 

" As Matthew Arnold once said to me, the story has 
been praised quite enough, for it gives only one side, 
and that not the best side, of Rugby school life, or of 
Arnold's character. It gives the reader the impression 
that it is the chief business of a public school to produce 
a healthy animal, to supply him with pleasant companions 
and faithful friends, to foster in him courage and truth- 
fulness, and for the rest to teach as much as the regu- 
lations of the school enforce, but no more. It is to be 
feared that Hughes's own boyhood was not spent with 
the best set at Rugby. . . . His typical school-boy is 
seen delighting in wanton mischief, in sport, in a fight, 
and even in a theft from a farm-yard, distinguished 
frequently by insolence to inferiors, and even by coarse- 
ness and brutality, but not by love of work or by any 
strong interest in intellectual pursuits. . . . This pic- 
ture of a public school, in spite of its attractive features 
and of its nnquestionable power and reality, will prob- 
ably be quoted in future years as illustrating the low 
standard of civilization, the false ideal of manliness, and 
the deep-seated indifference to learning for its own sake 
which characterized the upper classes of our youth in 
the early half of the nineteenth century." 

This is a somewhat unusual view to take of the 



famous schoolboy classic, but it is not without 
justification, and has peculiar interest from the 
fact that it is presented, in a way, as reflecting 
Matthew Arnold's own opinion. 

Sir Joshua quotes one passage from Matthew 
Arnold which has a pathetic personal interest. 
It is from the preface to the little volume of 
" Bible Reading for Schools," which was never 
used, as far as the writer knows, in any school 
whatever. 

*' For anyone who believes in the civilizing power of 
letters, and often talks of this belief, to think that he 
has for more than twenty years got his living by inspect- 
ing schools for the people, has gone in and out among 
them, has seen that the power of letters never reaches 
them at all, and that the whole study of letters is thereby 
discredited, and its power called in question, and yet 
has attempted nothing to remedy this state of things, 
cannot but be vexing and disquieting. He may truly 
say, like the Israel of the prophet, ' We have not wrought 
any deliverance in the earth! ' and he may well desire 
to do something to pay his debt to popular education 
before he finally departs, and to serve it, if he can, in 
that point where its need is sorest, where he has always 
said its need was sorest, and where, nevertheless, it is as 
sore still as when he began saying this twenty years ago. 
Even if what he does cannot be of service at once, owing 
to special prejudices and difficulties, yet these preju- 
dices and difficulties years are almost sure to dissipate, 
and the work may be of service hereafter." 

" Of service hereafter. ' Yes, in many ways 
of which a man can himself hardly conceive, 
work done for education in Matthew Arnold's 
spirit is sure to make its influence felt. That 
spirit, embodied in Arnold's many volumes of 
poetry and prose, is working like a leaven in 
thousands of generous minds, each of them in 
turn bringing others into its beneficent contact. 
Hence we welcome to the educational workshop 
such books as the two already discussed in this 
article, as well as the small volume of " Selec- 
tions from the Prose Writings of Matthew 
Arnold," which Professor Lewis E. Gates has 
just edited for school use. The selections em- 
brace " what is most characteristic in Arnold's 
criticism of literature and life," his best 
thoughts on style, translation, the function of 
criticism, the place of science in education, the 
antithesis of Hebraism and Helenism, the doc- 
trine of " sweetness and light," and the argu- 
ment for " the not ourselves " as the basis of a 
rational religious belief. There are about a 
score of selections altogether, filling nearly three 
hundred pages, and followed by some fifty pages 
of notes. The book is a companion to the ed- 
itor's similar volume devoted to Newman, and 
is provided, like its predecessor, with an elabo- 
rate introductory essay. This essay is deserv- 
ing of very high praise. It is artfully contrived

to present a conspectus of the whole circle of 
Arnoldian ideas, yet there is no suggestion of 
pedantic formalism in the treatment ; it is grace- 
ful, acute, subtle in suggestion, full of delicate 
felicities of expression, and altogether the most 
satisfactory critical discussion of Arnold with 
which we are acquainted. A part of the closing 
paragraph may be copied here to illustrate the 
quality of the whole. 

" He accepts with some sadness, it is true, and 
yet genuinely and generously the modern age, with 
its scientific bias and its worldly preoccupations; hu- 
manist as he is, half- romantic lover of an elder time, he 
yet masters his regret over what is disappearing and 
welcomes the present loyally. Believing, however, in 
the continuity of human experience, and above all in 
the transcendent worth to mankind of its spiritual ac- 
quisitions, won largely through the past domination of 
Christian ideals, he devotes himself to preserving the 
quintessence of this ideal life of former generations, and 
insinuating it into the hearts and imaginations of men of 
a ruder age. He converts himself into a patient medi- 
ator between the old and the new. Herein he contrasts 
with Newman on the one hand, and with the modern 
devotees of sestheticism on the other hand. . . . Arnold, 
with a temperament perhaps as exacting as either of 
these other temperaments, takes life as it offers itself 
and does his best with it. He sees and feels its crude- 
ness and disorderliness; but he has faith in the instincts 
that civilized men have developed in common, and finds 
in the working of these instincts the continuous, if irreg- 
ular, realization of the ideal."

THE POLYCHROME BIBLE.* 

The white light of Holy Writ has passed 
through a prism of " eminent biblical scholars," 
and has been broken into the colors of the 
critical spectrum. This process has been an- 
nounced in laudatory terms through many chan- 
nels for the last five years. We have been told 
that this will be the focal point of modern bib- 
lical scholarship, and in these terms : "The Poly- 
chrome Bible will have the unique distinction 
of representing the united Biblical scholarship 
of the civilized world." Of the civilized world !

editors reveals only English and German speak- 
ing scholars. Then " We are the people," and 
do other nationalities go for naught in biblical 
scholarship ? 

This spectrum Bible is to be a translation 
into modern English of a revised Hebrew text. 
It is to be so clear and intelligible as to do away 
with glossaries, commentaries, etc. It is to be 
a work not for scholars only, but " for the peo- 
ple." To indicate to " the people," " the results 
of modern biblical criticism as to the different 
sources from which some of the Old Testament 
Books have been made up, the [English] text 
is printed on variously colored backgrounds 
exhibiting the composite structure of the books." 
To these visual delights are added illustrations 
of the monuments of Egypt and Assyria, of 
biblical sites, etc. If these predictions and 
pledges are all fulfilled we shall have the most 
marvellous and most welcome and most useful 
religious work of the century the quintes- 
sence of modern biblical scholarship, modern 
literary English with ample explanatory notes 
and illustrations, and the banishment of com- 
mentaries. 

The appearance of three volumes of this series 
is hailed with peculiar satisfaction. With a 
lively interest we dip into their pages. Their 
chromatic and pictorial character lightens the 
appearance of the task, and gives them at first 
sight an air of popularity. We discover that 
each volume has the same twelve pages of 
" Introductory Remarks," in which the reader 
is dazed by two full pages, and double columned 
at that, of abbreviations ; and " the people " 
here ascertain, as they must if they are to read 
these volumes, the signification of J, E, JE, 
D, E, E2, H, and a lot of other alphabetic 
symbols. 

The volume on Judges uses a full set of seven 
colors, and also italics, to designate the different 
strata of documents originating from the ninth 
century down into post-exilic times. Chapter VI. 
alone exhibits six colors or backgrounds six 
documents pieced together with amazing inge- 
nuity. Professor Cheyne's Isaiah, rather group 
of Isaiahs, is both a critical analysis by colors, 
and a tearing up and a new arrangement of the 
entire book. There is nothing like it in all the 
field of biblical criticism. It is subjective, eru- 
dite, and revolutionary. The volume on the 
Psalms is not polychrome at all. It is a straight- 
forward white-page translation of the Psalter. 

A translation into modern English is one 
great aim of this series. These three books are 
quite enough to test the results. Of course,

the age-worn and smooth-sounding phrases of 
the Authorized and Revised Versions are missed, 
but in many passages, particularly in the Psalms, 
they are replaced by expressive and pithy mod- 
ern English. This indeed is not always the 
case. The beauty and clearness of translation, 
however, is sometimes marred by the element 
of emendation or conjecture which underlies it. 
The lay reader is often in doubt as to whether 
what he reads faithfully represents the original 
or is a conjectural emendation of the editor. 
Again, what timorous motive led the editors to 
put into the English translation such an un- 
pronounceable combination as JHVH ? Why 
not say either Jehovah or Jahweh ? 

" The explanatory notes " are critical, topo- 
graphical, and sometimes exegetical. But the 
pictures are only fair to medium are not new, 
but are found in other works, and some of them 
even reveal the hand of a late redactor, and 
still the colors are missing. 

It should perhaps be said that no one of the 
editors of the volumes already issued would 
dogmatically say that his statements are final ; 
in fact, " probable " is as strong a word as he 
would use. The volumes represent, not " the 
united Biblical scholarship of the civilized 
world," but each volume represents the scholar- 
ship of one man, with marks of a redactor's 
hand. They give us, visually, the analysis of 
the Old Testament as made by some of the 
most advanced schools of critics. Scientific 
students in literary and historical fields, and 
all Bible students, can now test the literary and 
historical methods and conclusions of these 
" eminent scholars." The Polychrome Bible, 
with its technicalities, its analyses, its critical 
standards, will be of value to scholars only ; 
ordinary Sunday-school or Bible-class teachers 
will find little if any interest in it. The popular 
features in illustration, in luxurious initial 
pieces, and chapter closings, will not outweigh 
its technique, will not make it a book " for the 
people." At present estimates, the Old Testa- 
ment alone will cost in twenty volumes about 
$40 not too much if it should fulfil all the 
promises made for it. But it falls far short, 
and bids fair now to be a scholarly work by 
"eminent scholars," and of real value through- 
out to scholars only. J BA ^ PRICE.

SOME RECENT BOOKS ON EDUCATION.* 

The latest addition to " The Great Educators " 
series is a volume on '-Horace Mann and the 
Common-School Revival in the United States," by 
Professor B. A. Hinsdale. Professor Hinsdale has 
given us an interesting, a judicious, and a capable 
sketch of this great educator, and of the common- 
school revival in which he bore so large a part 
There is also a well-considered and valuable resume 
of the progress of elementary education in the 
United States for the first two centuries of its his- 
tory. Professor Hinsdale naturally gives most 
attention to Mann's labors as Secretary of the Mas- 
sachusetts State Board of Education. Daring the 
twelve years he held this post he effected little less 
than a revolution in common-school education in 
that state, and his manifold self-sacrificing labors 
are set forth with clearness and with considerable 
fulness. One chapter is devoted to a very useful 
summary of Mann's famous Reports to the Board 
of Education. The author concludes this chapter 
by the remark that these documents present Mann 
to the world " as an educational statesman rather 
than a philosophical educator or a trained peda- 
gogist." " The reports are among the best existing 
expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best 
ones, of the practical benefits of a common-school 
education both to the individual and the State. 
The student or educator, the journalist or politician, 
who is seeking the best arguments in favor of 
popular education, will find them here." The 
book contains a selected bibliography. Altogether 
the work is a well-written and trustworthy account 
of perhaps the greatest hero in American educa- 
tional history. 

Professor Thwing, of Adelbert University, has 
lately added to his already considerable list of 
books on college subjects a work entitled " The 
American College in American Life." In this 
volume he aims " to bring the American college 
into closer relationship with American life, and 
so far as may be to bring American life into a 
more vital touch with the American college." 
Hence he is concerned chiefly with the college, not 
as producing scholars, but men of affairs and citi- 
zens, and as a general fitting-school for any worthy 
career. An interesting chapter is given to " Cer- 
tain Present Conditions," and the question is dis-

cussed, among others, as to whether we have too 
many colleges. The author decidedly thinks we 
have too many, and that every effort should be 
made " to prevent the foundation of more colleges ; 
to unite, if it be possible, certain ones of those now 
existing; to strengthen the colleges already well 
endowed, well established, and well situated, to 
make these not only great but the greatest possible." 
It is to be noted that President Thwing neither 
here nor elsewhere seems to consider the relation 
of college to university in reference to this question. 
Perhaps an ideal apportionment would be one 
high-school to every ten thousand population, one 
college to every hundred thousand, and one univer- 
sity to every million. Other chapters deal with 
such topics as college religion and morals, college 
expenses, difficulties and dangers of college life, 
etc.; and finally there is an optimistic chapter on 
the future of the American college. The volume is, 
as a whole, a good conspectus, and will be especi- 
ally serviceable to all who have to do with college 
administration. 

The "Teaching of Morality," by Sophie Bryant, 
D.Sc., is a brief but suggestive handbook for 
teachers and parents. The opening chapter is a 
close philosophical and psychological treatment of 
"Moral Education in General," followed by chap- 
ters on the "Intellectual and Moralizing Processes 
Involved in the Study of Morality," on the " Prin- 
ciples of Teaching," and on "Virtuous Character" 
and "Social Membership." Great stress is laid on 
initiative, on leading the pupil to a stage of rational 
self-activity. The whole book shows a clear insight, 
based on both experience and reflection ; and we 
regret that a large portion is so condensed, abstract, 
and dry, that it must fail of the widest service. A 
single sentence is worth quoting as giving some idea 
of the author's method and standpoint. " My 
experience based on some teaching to school 
girls between the ages of twelve and eighteen is, 
(1) that young people are much interested in the 
ideas of right and wrong; (2) that they are apt to 
be impressed and effectively moved by that strain 
of moral reflection which shows the unity of virtue 
in all variety of virtues ; and (3 ) that they acquire 
this kind of knowledge as naturally as any other, 
while they are apt to apply it with more interest 
and skill." 

Dr. Francis Warner, who is already favorably 
known for his works on psychology, has given us a 
valuable manual on " The Study of Children and 
their School Training." It is distinctly a physio- 
logical study of the growth of the child from early 
years through adolescence, giving special attention 
to nerve-signs of all kinds. In a very definite, 
concrete way, and with illustrations, the reader is 
taught to observe in children such physical expres- 
sions as twitchings, "fidgetiness," hand and head 
postures, etc., and to interpret them aright. This 
book seems to us an extremely suggestive and 
important one for teachers and parents ; and being 
simply written, and free from technicalities, it may 



be understood and applied with ease by any reader. 
As an example of Dr. Warner's method of expound- 
ing his subject, we quote a paragraph from the 
Introductory Chapter. " A boy, eight years of age, in 
preparatory school, was said to be so dull at learn- 
ing Latin that it was thought impossible to continue 
the attempt to teach him. He was healthy and 
well made ; he showed no signs of mental defect, 
and was, otherwise, quick and bright. He had 
learned to read well, and read story books for 
pleasure. I noticed that, in reading, he followed 
the words on the printed line by moving his head, 
not moving his eyes in their orbits ; this did well 
enough for story-reading, when he skipped much 
of the page. Moving the head in place of turning 
the eyes did not admit of sufficient accuracy for 
studying Latin. Some attention to eye-drill soon 
removed all the difficulty complained of, and the 
boy made good progress. This cause of mental 
dullness serves to illustrate the usefulness to teach- 
ers of personal observation." 

Another book on Child Study is Professor James 
Sully's "Children's Ways," an abridgment of his 
work on "Studies of Childhood," made to suit 
" the requirements of the general reader." This 
book consists mainly of anecdotes dealing with 
children who have attained some command of 
language. The work is a compilation, largely from 
Stanley Hall and other American observers ; but it 
is not a very clear or well connected whole. In his 
efforts at popularizing, Professor Sully sometimes 
assumes a certain condescension which is uncalled 
for either by the subject or by the reader. Some 
of Professor Sully's remarks will doubtless seem 
questionable, both to the general reader and 
advanced student, as when he assures us that 
animals have no imagination. While the book as a 
whole can hardly be regarded as adequate to the 
subject, it will undoubtedly be of considerable inter- 
est and value to parents and others. 

Bishop Spalding's latest volume, " Thoughts and 
Theories of Life and Education," contains a series 
of addresses of a general character on the nature 
and spirit of education in relation to life. These 
discourses are not meant so much for information 
as for inspiration ; but while the truth is mostly 
truism, it is always earnestly and often eloquently 
rehearsed with an Emersonian sententiousness. 
The last chapter, on "The Teacher and the 
School," speaks bravely for the elevation of the 
common school above politics, and of teaching to a 
definite rank as a profession. 

Number XLII. of the International Educational 
Series is " Bibliography of Education," by Mr. W. 
S. Monroe. This is a selected list of 3,200 books 
printed in English, and mostly of recent date. In 
some instances a descriptive note is added. We 
find this list lacking in some points, as, for instance, 
it mentions neither Brodrick's " History of Oxford 
University " nor Charles Dickens's "Schools and 
Schoolmasters "; nor yet do we find notice of Emer- 
son's " College Year Book," or of " Minerva." On

the other hand, it includes many books which cer- 
tainly do not belong in a bibliography of this scope, 
as Farrar's " Life of Christ," and Kant's " Critique

though we do not think this list as good a one of 
its size as might be made, yet it will be found

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 

Mr. Theodore Roosevelt's " Ameri- 
^n Ideals, and Other Essays Social 
and Political " (Putnam) is in many 
respects an excellent book for young Americans 
especially to read. The best part of it is its tren- 
chant discussion of the problems and scandals of 
our municipal politics and of the duties of the citi- 
zen in relation thereto. What Mr. Roosevelt says 
in this regard is so sound and patriotic that his oc- 
casionally rather " bumptious " manner of saying it 
is the more regrettable. There is a certain something 
in Mr. Roosevelt's manner or personality that has 
led people to take a somewhat comic view of him, 
and to treat his pretensions as a social and political 
philosopher and teacher with some levity. But it 
cannot be denied that his own record is exception- 
ally such as to entitle him to a most respectful hear- 
ing on municipal questions, and even to warrant 
him in lecturing with some asperity the deplorably 
large class of people who shirk the performance of 
all such political duties as involve the prospect of 
risk or inconvenience or unpleasantness to them- 
selves in fact, of such duties as make a real de- 
mand on one's manhood and patriotism. Mr. Roose- 
velt has himself gone down into the thick of the 
fray like a man, and done battle with the " boss " 
and the " heeler " on his own ground ; and he nat- 
urally harbors a robust contempt for those whom 
he calls the " timid good." He has no sort of pa- 
tience with the superfine folks who shun contact 
with their ruder and coarser fellow mortals, and 
mince daintily through life much as a sleek house- 
cat picks its way over a gutter. In his opinion, the 
man who is too timid or too finical or too indifferent 
to take part in the often rough and disagreeable 
preliminary work that must be done at the caucuses 
and primaries, if we are to have honest government 
and decent officials in this country, is out of place 
in a republic. Mr. Roosevelt's patriotic heat leads 
him into a little inconsistency now and then. He 
scolds, for instance, at the American who, electing 
to live abroad, makes his home in England or France 
or Germany, and tries to become an Englishman or 
a Frenchman or a German, accordingly ; but for 
the foreigner, on the other hand, who expatriates 
himself, who abjures his native patriotism and the 
land of his birth, who comes to us and tries by every 
means in his power to divest himself of his own 
nationality and become an American, Mr. Roose- 



velt has nothing but praise. But Mr. Roosevelt's 
rule seems to be one of those poor ones that will 
not work both ways. The essays in the present 
volume are reprinted from leading periodicals, and 
they deserve for the most part their more durable 

setting. 

In tracing the History of Oratory, 
The eommonttt Professor Lorenzo Sears produced a 

form of oratory. * 

book popular enough to be of general 
interest and yet careful enough in its plan and treat- 
ment to be of value to the student. His later work, 
"The Occasional Address" (Putnam), is of some- 
what similar character ; it is founded upon material 
carefully gathered from many sources ; it is planned 
and developed carefully, and with sufficient par- 
ticularity ; it is written in a pleasant vein that makes 
it easy reading. As in the previous book, the man 
who searches for definite facts is often vexed at not 
finding them, or at sometimes, perhaps, finding de- 
batable matters stated in too confident a way. But 
these books do not affect to be works of deep eru- 
dition : they are rather, we should say, designed 
first for the college student, and we think them 
well calculated to reach their audience. "The 
Occasional Address " is the term chosen by Professor 
Sears to designate a form of demonstrative oratory 
very common here in America, and one which comes 
most readily within the reach of college students. 
The term denotes speeches, orations, addresses, 
made on special occasions, commemorations, cele- 
brations, and the like. To be more exact, and to 
mention as examples the special forms discussed by 
Professor Sears in Part III., it includes such forms 
of speaking as the Eulogy, the Commemorative 
Oration, the Expository Address or Lecture, the 
Commencement Oration, the After-Dinner Speech. 
To such forms of speaking, we Americans, as has 
often been pointed out, are greatly inclined ; every 
one of us may therefore read Professor Sears's book 
with a sort of personal interest. It includes not 
only a discussion of the different forms noted above, 
but also of the different qualities necessary to such 
speaking, and also (indeed, the topic is treated 
first) an analysis of the elements of such an address, 
as purpose, subject, particular parts. The topic 
is undoubtedly one of very considerable and very 
broad interest. And although we regret in this 
book a sort of vagueness or even of inaccuracy 
which we sometimes perceive, we presume that these 
matters are almost of necessity incident to a mode 
of treatment which will put the topic in an attrac- 
tive manner before the large audience which will 
find interest in it. 

A certain catholicity of taste, if it be 
genuine, is generally earnest of power 
of mind as well as breadth. A man 
may be familiar with Leopardi and Senancour and 
the poetry of Matthew Arnold, and yet be a prig. 
He may be devoted to Browning and Shelley, and 
yet be merely following a current fashion. He may 
see great and wonderful things in Walt Whitman's

every line, and yet be what he too often is. He may 
be interested in Hauptmann, and yet have no espe- 
cial care for literature beyond a sort of journalistic 
" modernity." But it is not easy to imagine a man 
to have had all these interests without being, or at 
least becoming, himself rather an interesting per- 
sonality. There has also been held to be a certain 
sacramental effect in a great author ; so that a man 
who has read Balzac, for instance, must be different 
from a man who has not. Such an effect may not 
be inevitable with one or another, but to some de- 
gree it is inevitable after such broad reading as we 
have been speaking of. Here are two adequate 
reasons for looking at Mr. W. N. Guthrie's "Poet 
Prophets " (Robert Clarke Co.) Nor will the book 
disappoint confident expectation. As a rule, we 
distrust the criticism that takes as a fundamental 
position the view implied in that title, because that 
criticism is too apt to be a kneading-up of the whole- 
wheat flour of Carlyle with the water of book-club 
wisdom, often without the yeast of individuality. 
But a follower of Carlyle is not apt to have tidings 
of Leopardi, nor is a book-club prophet apt to speak 
intelligently of Mr. Swinburne. Mr. Guthrie's table 
of contents restored the equanimity shaken by his 
title. We recommend his book to the reader. From 
a good many of his opinions we dissent. But that 
minor matter is lost in the refreshing feeling which 
comes from a new volume of essays on literature, 
that is neither a bundle of clever enough aperrus 
dredged up from forgotten periodicals, nor a few 
pleasant revivals of current literary gossip. This 
is a volume of essays on literary topics, thought out 
coherently and in earnest, and put down seriously, 
although not with the heavy hand that allows noth- 
ing for the amenities of writing. . We think that 
Mr. Guthrie on the whole takes a standpoint some- 
what too philosophical. We think that this pre- 
vents him from being a great critic, because it does 
not disclose some more purely literary values. It 
may also prevent some from reading him with 
pleasure, because he often gets beyond the easy com- 
prehension of the healthy general reader. Still, this 
is rather a small point, and perhaps also something 
of a matter of opinion. 

In the latest issue of the " Contem- 
P rai 7 Science Series" (Scribner) 
we have an admirable monograph 
upon an extremely important but neglected subject, 
the blessed gift of sleep. The book comes originally 
from Russia ; and its author, Marie de Manace"ine, 
exhibits an unusual power of judicious statement 
and orderly arrangement. The volume sums up in 
a very readable form our knowledge regarding the 
condition in which we pass a third of our lives. 
This knowledge is grouped about four headings, 
the physiology of sleep, its pathology, its hygiene, 
and its psychology. What occurs within the body 
during sleep ; the intensity of sleep at various pe- 
riods of the night; the changes in the nature of 
sleep as we grow older ; the changes in the circula- 



tion of the blood, in respiration, and, most signifi- 
cant of all, in the nervous system, these and many 
equally important factors that distinguish the con- 
dition of the body in sleep from that in waking hours 
are clearly described in the light of recent research. 
The pathology is mainly given over to the nature 
and varieties of insomnia, and of its opposite, the 
excessive tendency to sleep, and also to sleep-like 
conditions, somnambulism, half-waking states, and 
the like. How we ought to sleep is told us in no 
pedantic or arbitrary strain, but in the light of ascer- 
tained principles judiciously applied with due refer- 
ence to age and health and habits and condition of 
life. The psychology is mainly concerned with the 
mental activities during sleep ; the direction of the 
attention ; the subdued but not perfectly passive 
senses ; the alert lower centres, and the operation 
of the mind in dreams. The dream-world, however 
individual and fantastic, yet has its laws and prin- 
ciples. The light of psychological research has 
penetrated into the recesses of the sleeping soul, and 
to a certain extent has shown what stuff our dreams 
are made of. Perhaps the day is not distant when 
we shall pay as much attention to the formation of 
good habits of sleep as of good habits during our 
waking hours, and the determination of what is 
wholesome in the one case as in the other can come 
only as the result of a comprehensive study of our 
mental and bodily activities. A valuable introduc- 
tion to such study is furnished by this well-written 
volume. Its value is further enhanced for English 
readers by copious additions to the English edition, 
including mainly those due to the ingenuity and 
industry of English and American workers. 

One of the most universal tendencies 
among clever people is a leaning 
toward private theatricals : almost 
everybody, indeed, has something of it. It is true 
that in most cases the feeling never comes to any 
sort of realization ; but it comes to realization often 
enough to make it a little curious at first thought 
that there are not more good amateur plays than 
there are. Second thoughts, of course, inform one 
that the reason is that in this matter the universal 
desire of the amateur is to be professional. Ama- 
teur companies are apt to prefer rather difficult 
plays from the real stage, society comedies of the 
day, for instance. At any rate, since half the fun 
lies in being professional, amateur plays are not 
much sought after. We think, however, that there 
are many who may find in " The Charm, and other 
Drawing-Room Plays," by Sir Walter Besant and 
Mr. Walter H. Pollock, some little things that will 
be quite as good to give as many that are much 
more ambitious. Drawing-room plays these are 
called, and they depend, therefore, more on costume 
than on scenery and more on dialogue than on 
situation. Two or three of them are costume plays 
which give excellent opportunity for exquisite and 
careful preparation. But there are half a dozen 
which need no more than the costume of the day

and the opportunities of any drawing-room. They 
are all short and well within the reach of any set of 
amateurs who are not absolute beginners. Absolute 
beginners should confine themselves to Shakespeare. 
We do not know that it is much to the purpose to 
comment on the literary characteristics of these 
plays, but it may not be out of place to remark that 
they have not the slightest reminiscence or flavor of 
present literary conditions. Ibsen, Hauptmann, 
Sudermann, Maeterlinck, Pinero, might never have 
existed so far as these sketches indicate. They 
continue the traditions of the British Drama of 
twenty-five years ago. The average amateur may 
not object to this point : technically, the plays are 
clever and suited to their purpose ; that may be 
enough for him. But we do not see why, in a period 
of considerable dramatic ferment, the amateur as 
well as the professional should not be aware of cur- 
rent movement in his art 



ttudyof 
Anarctiitm. 



Mr - E - V ; Zenker's book on Anarch- 
ism, published by Messrs. Putnams, 
deserves particular attention. The 
author has dealt with a very obscure and strange 
theory, and with conflicting phases of that theory, 
in a sane and orderly way. He gives sufficient 
biographical, historical, and economic information 
to make the subject clear to any intelligent reader, 
and he has inserted authoritative statements from 
original sources at critical points, so that the book 
may be used as evidence. It can hardly be said 
that his discussion of the greatest leaders is adequate 
and final, though it is a good sketch. The conclu- 
sion is moderate in tone and free from all elements 
of panic. The author thinks that a policy of sup- 
pression of discussion and of unusual and special 
penalties is not desirable. The criminal law is, as 
Lord Koseberry said, amply sufficient to cope with 
the " party of action." Some phases of truth have 
been brought out by Anarchists, and the criticism 
of existing society can best be met by more compe- 
tent theory and by practical measures of ameliora- 
tion. "We therefore demand for the Anarchist 
doctrine, as long as it does not incite to crime, the 
right of free discussion and the tolerance due to 
every opinion, quite without regard to whether it is 
more dangerous, or more probable, or more practic- 
able than any other opinion." The social function 
of Anarchism is in its criticism of Socialism as the 
tyranny of the majority over the individual, and in 
its criticism of a social system which neglects the 
least influential members of society. 

We are not wholly in favor of col- 
lections of already-published stories 
by well-known novelists, nor of the 
essays of by-gone years by well-known men of let- 
ters, nor, by anybody, of the weekly or monthly 
contributions to some page or column. But when a 
man eminent in some other respects gathers together 
such work as he has had time to do in letters, the re- 
sult is apt to be interesting. Thus, the president of 



a great university makes a selection from his occa- 
sional articles of twenty-five years, and the result 
has value ; or a great preacher publishes the non- 
clerical addresses or essays he has had time to write, 
and the result again has value. In like manner 
Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge's " Certain Accepted He- 
roes " (Harper) is a book which stands a little aside 
from the ordinary collections of essays. Books of 
this character always have, besides the intrinsic 
value of their contents, a sort of additional value in 
the known position of their author. It is, however, 
rather interesting to look at this book without any 
recollection of what we really know of the author. 
Here are three or four essays on literary subjects, 
three which are chiefly political, and two which are 
historical. Or, again, we have two which would 
reverse current conceptions, two which would show 
that in some directions we are as good as the En- 
glish, two which have a full-blooded interest in 
public affairs, two which are the result of disinter- 
ested curiosity, and one other. The book is written 
by a man of wide range of interest, a man who 
believes in public life and in America too, a man 
who has the curiosity of the scholar, as well, per- 
haps, as a certain amount of the current pleasure in 
removing ancient landmarks. It may be that we 
have here enough criteria to identify at once the 
junior Senator from Massachusetts. Perhaps he 
will not thank us for having hinted that the field of 
literature is not that in which he is most at home. 
But he cannot find fault with us for considering his 
essays better than some work we have seen by 
writers who are more definitely thought of as men 
of letters. 



A notable publication, by Messrs. D. C. 

contribution to Heath & Co., of the second part of 
Goethe study. Goethe's Faust," edited, with Intro- 
duction and Notes, by Professor Calvin Thomas of 
Columbia University, is a noteworthy event in the 
history of Goethe study in America. We had sev- 
eral editions of the First Part before that by Pro- 
fessor Thomas, though none so good ; and in the 
present volume he has been guided by the same 
idea that characterized his former work. He em- 
phasizes the value of " Faust " as literature : not as 
didactics or philosophy or allegory, but as a work 
of art. The editorial matter shows abundant evi- 
dence of sound linguistic scholarship and of thor- 
ough familiarity with the more immediate depart- 
ment of Goethe philology, but it is the literary 
aspect of the work that renders it distinctive. In 
an Introduction of some seventy pages, Professor 
Thomas goes into a careful study of the genesis of 
the poem. He traces the idea of the division into 
two parts : the growth of the Helena episode, and 
its connection in completed form with the first and 
second and with the last two acts. More briefly, 
the Second Part as a whole is considered ; and fin- 
ally some critical observations are added. Professor 
Thomas has no occult interpretation to urge, is not 
even concerned to explain away the inconsistencies

of the work or to argue a unity that the poet never 
imagined that he had given his work. His study 
has been, rather, a labor of love that has found its 
own highest reward in the spiritual assimilation of 
the master's thought, and that seeks to open to the 
student the same rich treasure. The hundred and 
twenty pages of notes discuss real difficulties, ex- 
plain allusions that might he unfamiliar to the ordi- 
nary reader, present the results of the best and most 
scholarly criticism, but do not pretend to be ex- 
haustive or to discuss the pros and cons of disputed 
interpretations. The work makes it possible for the 
student interested in Goethe's poetry to read and 
enjoy his greatest work. Its result should and 
doubtless will be to promote the study of " Faust " 
in our colleges and by the intelligent and reading 
public. 

At first glance Mr. Arthur Hassall's 
A handbook of Hand-book of European History, 

European history. . . o _. .,_ * ... " 

476 to 1871 (Macmillan) seems 
superfluous, since there already exists the hand- 
book of Floetz, with an English translation. But 
on examination one finds in Mr. Hassall's work a 
much fuller and more complete array of facts, cov- 
ering a much less extended field. The book is 
therefore not without its reason for being. The 
arrangement is also an improvement, and a vast 
improvement, on that of Ploetz. If we could add 
that the work was perfectly accurate, or even 
reasonably so, there could be no higher praise. But, 
unfortunately, it is not accurate ; and thus the one 
eminent virtue of a hand-book of dates is wanting. 
Opening the book at random, one discovers on care- 
ful examination that there are six errors on pages 
146 and 147. The Synod of Dort is said to have 
met in 1618, while the correct date is 1619 ; the 
deposition of Ferdinand of Bohemia is given as 
taking place in April, 1619, instead of August. The 
battle of the White Hill is placed in 1621, while it 
was fought in 1620 ; the Protestant Union was dis- 
solved in April, but this compilation says the month 
was May ; it speaks of the Four Articles of Perth, 
but there were Five, and it gives the date of their 
enactment as August 25, 1618, instead of August 
27. Errors so numerous and so inexcusable render 
the work of but small value. 



A new Life of 
William of Orange. 



The world's interest in the great 
leader in the Dutch War for Inde- 
pendence, like that in our own 
Washington, seems to grow rather than abate, and 
thus each has met successfully the final test of 
greatness. Last year we welcomed the scholarly 
and fascinating volumes of our American student, 
Miss Ruth Putnam ; now the veteran English 
scholar and author, Mr. Frederic Harrison, has put 
out another study of the great Dutch patriot in the 
" Foreign Statesmen " series (Macmillan). Mr. 
Harrison's life of Oliver Cromwell has been recog- 
nized as a model of its kind : a brief political bi- 
ography that is clear and impartial, yet with the 



vitality and interest that come from deep interest 
in the subject and profound study of it. He has 
the ability to see the faults in his hero, and yet see 
them subordinate to that hero's great qualities. 
This new book is a worthy companion to the former, 
and portrays a character in many ways like that of 
the great Puritan. The author's knowledge of the 
sixteenth century is so intimate that he is able to 
put before the reader in brief compass the complex 
situation of European affairs, not attempting to fol- 
low its tangled threads, but to show the leading 
motives that shaped the conduct of English, French, 
German, and Spanish rulers in their relations to the 
desperate struggle of the Netherlands for political 
and religious liberty. And the frank disclosure of 
the weaknesses of William, his prevarications, sub- 
tlety, and occasional wrong-headedness, only fur- 
nishes the contrast that makes his steadfastness, his 
complete self-sacrifice, his far-seeing statesmanship, 
and his broad religious toleration in an exceedingly 
narrow age, the more resplendent. The busy man 
can come to know the real William through this 
little book ; while the historical specialist will be 
grateful to the author, for it is a fresh study from 
the sources. 



Pleasant studies 
out of doors. 



Mr. Charles M. Skinner's latest vol- 



ume gives a hint of his piquant way 
of putting things in its title, " With 
Feet to the Earth " (Lippincott), by which is meant 
the attitude necessary to the pedestrian. Mr. Skin- 
ner is a lover of Nature, and is never in better mood 
than when he is with her or talking about her. She 
sets his thoughts at work, and the pen puts down 
the results in serious, humorous, and always choice 
phraseology. The ten sketches which make up the 
present volume relate the author's experience in a 
series of rambles in the city and the country, at 
different seasons of the year and varying hours of 
the day and night. There is no particular study of 
animal or plant life apparent, but there is a keen and 
broad appreciation of all that lives out of doors, and 
much apt and suggestive reflection upon the mani- 
fold phases of earth and sky, and upon the human 
life which gives interest to the scenes of earth.

In point of precept, the book is an excellent one for

college-bred youth of to-day will have much patience 
with the Queen-Anne mannerisms and old-time arti- 
ficialities and conceits of style generally with which 
Mr. Curtis thought fit to stucco over much of his 
" Easy Chair " moralizing.

An unusually attractive book for the 
novice in the study of entomology is 
one by Professor Clarence Moores 
Weed, recently published under the title of " Life 
Histories of American Insects " (Macmillan). Its 
entire aspect is engaging, from the large open type, 
handsome page, and abundant illustrations, to the 
curiously pied cover besprinkled with bugs and 
beetles on an underground of leaves. Twenty-six 
species or groups of species are figured in the book, 
and their stories told in clear and explicit terms. 
In many respects the story of insect life is the story 
of human life on a diminutive scale. Tbe instincts 
and appetites are strong and crude, the sagacity 
and artifice manifested are astonishing, and the 
whole history, from egg to imago, shows the mani- 
fold resemblances between man and the lower grades 
of animal life. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The student of classical archaeology will find his ac- 
count in the handsome new volume of Signer Rodolfo 
Lanciani, entitled " The Ruins and Excavations of An- 
cient Rome" (Houghton). It is "a companion book 
for students and travellers," running into upwards of 
six hundred pages, and richly illustrated with maps, 
diagrams, and photographic plates. The work is made 
useful in every imaginable way, and has, of course, the 
additional advantage of being entirely op to date. We 
may at the same time mention the publication of " The 
Christian Monuments of Rome " (Black), by H. M. and 
M. A. R. T., which is the first part of a " Handbook to 
Christian and Ecclesiastical Rome," intended, when 
complete, to occupy no less than four such volumes as 
this. 

Mr. Temple Scott's " Book Sales of 1897," just pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co., takes its place upon the 
shelf with the similar volumes for previous years. 
American sales (to the number of three) are now for 
the first time included within the scope of this valuable 
bibliographical work. The entries run nearly up to six 
thousand, and are, of course, selected from a much 
larger possible number. Mr. Scott notes an advanced 
demand for French writers of the eighteenth century, 
and sustained values for works on English literature, 
sport, and early gardening, as well as for Americana, 
and extra-illustrated volumes. On the other hand, 
Cruikshankiana and Kelmscott books show some signs 
of a tendency to go out of fashion. 

We noticed in these columns a few months ago a 
very helpful book on Latin Manuscripts. The same 
class of readers to whom that book appeals advanced 
students and teachers will have reason to thank Mr. 
W. M. Lindsay, of Jesus College, Oxford, for his 
" Handbook of Latin Inscriptions " just issued from the 
press of Allyn & Bacon. After stating very lucidly, 
in the introductory paragraphs, some of the fundamen- 
tal principles of form changes in Latin, the author 
gives a collection of inscriptions in illustration of these 
changes from the earliest period down to " Imperial 
and Late Latin." For long years to come, as in the 
past, a large proportion of Latin teaching preparatory 
to college must be done by those who have not had the 



advantages of graduate study and have not the means 
to secure for themselves the published results of classi- 
cal research. For these teachers, whose embarrassing 
position is their misfortune and not their fault, such 
handbooks as this are an inestimable boon, and the 
friends of classical study may well work and pray that 
their number may increase. 

* A Text-Book of General Botany " (Longmans), by 
Dr. Carlton C. Curtis, is a work of considerable dimen- 
sions, based upon the laboratory work required of begin- 
ners at Columbia University. It takes up a series of 
species, and provides material for a stiff year's course 
of two hours' daily work. The illustrations, although 
not as numerous as in many works of this description, 
are exceptionally well-chosen and carefully drawn. Mr. 
L. H. Bailey's " Lessons with Plants " (Macmillan) is 
designed for very young students, and deals in simple 
style, not only with the elements of botanical science, 
but also with many practical matters of gardening. 
Mrs. Lucy L. W. Wilson's " Nature Study in Elemen- 
tary Schools " (Macmillan), is a manual for teachers, 
and comes highly recommended by Colonel F. W. Parker, 
who contributes a brief preface. 

In the way of modern language texts, the latest pub- 
lications sent us are the following: a volume of "Vol- 
taire's Prose " (Heath), edited by Professors Adolphe 
Cohn and B. D. Woodward; " An Elementary Scientific 
French Reader" (Heath), by Dr. P. Mariotte-Davies ; 
* La Guerre de 1'Inde'pendance en Ame"rique " (Ginn), 
by M. A. Morrean, edited by Professor A. N. Van 
Daell; Schiller's " WUhelm Tell" (Macmillan), edited 
by Professor W. H. Carrnth; Herr Helbig's "Die 
Komodie anf der Hochschule " (Heath), edited by Pro- 
fessor B. W. Wells; Zschokke's "Der Zerbrochene 
Krug " (Heath), edited by Professor E. S. Joynes; and 
Part II. of "Faust" (Heath), in the scholarly edition 
of Professor Calvin Thomas. In this connection, it may 
not be out of place to mention Dr. C. A. Buchheim's 
" Golden Treasury " edition of " Heinrieh Heine's Lieder 
und Gedichte," published by the Macmillan Co. 

That the " reader " still holds its own as an educa- 
tional device is evident from the many publications of 
this description that continue to issue from the press. 
But the crusade against the fragmentary reader of the 
traditional sort is having its effect, and some degree of 
unity is usually aimed at by the modern compiler. 
Illustrations of this tendency are offered by Mr. J. H. 
Stickney's " Earth and Sky " (Ginn) ; " Australia and 
the Isles of the Sea" (Silver), edited by Mr. Larkin 
Dunton; and the volumes called "Stepping Stones to 
Literature" (Silver), edited by Miss Sarah L. Arnold 
and Charles B. Gilbert. The older type of book ap- 
pears in "The Children's Fourth Reader" (Ginn) of 
Miss Ellen M. Cyr, and the " Lincoln Literary Collec- 
tion " (American Book Co.) of Mr. J. P. McCaskey. 

Covering in his pubb'c life the long period between 
the War of 1812 and the Civil War, twice a member 
of Congress, participating in Jackson's attack on the 
United States Bank, strongly opposed to the agitation 
of the Abolitionists, actively connected with the annex- 
ation of Texas, and always loyal to the Democratic 
party, Charles Jared Ingersoll is well worthy of a 
place among the public men of America, the memory 
of whose services too often passes away with them. 
His " Life and Letters " (Lippincott) at the hands of 
his grandson, Mr. William M. Meigs, enables one to 
form a very fair estimate of his work and his attitude 
toward the various questions of the day.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 



London, Feb. 5, 1898. 

Although the air and sky here are balmy and blue 
enough to make us hope for an early spring, the season 
of the new incoming of books shows, as yet, no signs of 
approach. The hedges may be budding and the young 
plants shooting, but the " voice of the turtle " is not yet 
heard in the land. Here and there one hears whisper- 
ings and twitterings, but hardly any coherent statement 
of what we are to expect. That Mr. LeGallienne has 
finished his " Romance of Zion Chapel " will be no news 
to you; indeed, by the time this reaches you the work 
may be already published. Also, that Mr. E. F. Ben- 
son's new story, " The Vintage," is to be issued imme- 
diately will not be fresh. Yon will, probably, have heard 
that Mr. Frank Mathew, the author of " The Wood of 
the Brambles," has been engaged on a novel, and that 
it is to be called "A Lady's Sword"; that the title of 
" George Egerton's " long story is to be " The Wheels 
of God"; that Menie Muriel Dowie has written a rival 
to her "Gallia"; and that Mrs. Gertrude Atherton, 
whose " American Wives and English Husbands " is 
almost delivered by the binders, has ready another novel, 
a sort of companion to this, to be entitled " The Great 
Black Oxen." Mr. S. R. Crockett's new romance will 
deal with the suppression of brigandage in Apulia. I 
find that Mr. Haggard's story is to be called " Elissa," 
and Sir Walter Besant's " The Changeling." 

All this I need not have retailed, no doubt; but even 
old news requires reviving occasionally, just to keep us 
in mind of what it may often be very necessary not to 
forget. Now-a-days, one hears of coming events so far 
ahead of their happening that when they do occur they 
come as a surprise. I may, however, add, by way of 
apology for referring to these writers and their works, 
that " The Wheels of God " will be well worth reading. 
It is Mrs. Claremont's first essay at a long story, and 
its theme is sure to interest and fascinate. Mr. Frank 
Mathew is an able story-teller, and his new book is said 
to be even better than his last. 

We have living in London a very charming and very 
facile young widow, who writes under the name of G. 
Colmore. She has already written a volume of poems, 
and one or two novels; but none have made much im- 
pression. I have had occasion, lately, to read the proof 
sheets of a new book of verses she is passing through 
the press, and I confess their contents have astonished 
me not a little. The poems are collectively called 
" Points of View," a title which seems to give no clue 
of any value. Therefore I shall say that the " points 
of view " refer to the excuses for " the conduct of life" 
which various individuals have to offer for their partic- 
ular sins of omission or commission. The writer shows 
a remarkable facility for versifying; but the chief 
strength of her work is in the keen-sighted sympathy it 
everywhere displays. If the book does not get talked 
about, then it must be either that I am an easily im- 
pressed person, or that the world of readers is become 
sadly blase. 

You will be glad to hear that Burton's masterpiece in 
travellers' tales, " The Pilgrimage to Mecca and Me- 
dinah," is at last to be published in a cheap and handy 
form. It will be remembered that the copyright of the 
first edition of this great work expires in the present 
year. In 1879, however, a third edition was issued in 
which the late Sir Richard Burton included many revi- 



sions and alterations. This edition, under the editor- 
ship of Lady Burton, was issued about four years ago 
in two volumes. Now the copyright of this last issue 
has been acquired by Messrs. George Bell & Sons, and 
the two volumes with all the illustrations will soon form 
part of that firm's " Bohn's Standard Library." When 
published, they will make the most remarkable two- 
dollars' worth of reading in any language. 

We are promised the completion of the printed cat- 
alogue of the books in the British Museum, early in the 
twentieth century. This catalogue has been a good 
many years in the making, and when it is finished a se- 
ries of supplemental volumes will have to be started 
immediately; but had it never have been begun one 
would have wondered where on earth the officials in 
charge of our National Library would have placed the 
manuscript-catalogue. When the printing commenced, 
the MS. volumes numbered 3,000; what they would 
have amounted to now, it would be difficult to say. 
Even in the printed form, the reference set in the 
reading-room, which has blank leaves for additions, will 
make a goodly row of a thousand volumes. 

Two or three new publishers are about to appear in 
London, but what they are going to publish is not yet 
known. One of them, Mr. Gerald Duckworth, learned 
his business with Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., so that we 
may expect prettily got up books, at any rate; but 
whether he is to publish new works, or will follow the 
advice of the Authors' Society, and re-make the old 
books, I cannot say. Another new-comer, Mr. John 
Long, has set himself the task of catering for the novel- 
reading public, and already, I learn, he has in the press 
stories by Mrs. Lovett Cameron, Miss Esmd Stuart, F. 
W. Robinson, and Dr. Gordon Stables. At this rate our 
Publishers' Association will become a wealthy body, 
fifty-two dollars per member, per annum, soon mounts 
up. But what are they going to do ? 

"Ian Maclaren," the other day, made a speech on 
"Local Patriotism"; by way of illustration he related 
the following experience : " Not long ago I was travel- 
ling from Aberdeen to Perth. A man sitting opposite 
studied me for a minute, and then, evidently being con- 
vinced that I had average intelligence, and could appre- 
ciate a great sight if I saw it, he said, ' If you will stand 
up with me at the window, I will show you something 
in a minute; you will only get a glimpse suddenly and 
for an instant.' I stood. He said, Can you see that ? ' 
I saw some smoke, and said so. That 's Kirriemuir,' 
he answered. I sat down, and he sat opposite me, and 
watched my face to see that the fact that I had had a 
glimpse of Kirriemuir, or rather of its smoke, was one I 
thoroughly appreciated, and would carry in retentive 
memory for the rest of my life. Then I said, ' Mr. 
Barrie was born there.' ' Yes,' he said, ' he was ; and I 
was born there myself.' " 

Mr. Fitzgerald, the mountaineer, has come back from 
his expedition to the Andes, and is being interviewed 
right and left. Of course, his adventures are to be 
embodied in a book, for which, I need hardly say, the 
younger publishers have competed not a little. The 
fortunate firm is now ready, and announces the work 
for the coming autumn, to be issued in such elaborate 
fashion as to make the handsomest book of travels ever 
published. Well, I hope they will make a success of it. 
But I cannot, for the life of me, see what benefit is to 
be got by paying a writer a price which forbids a profit 
on the publication of his work, unless the work prove a 
phenomenal success. No doubt, Mr. Fitzgerald's book

will be hailed "the book of the season"; still, it will 
require much more " booming " and puffing ere the 
money speculated find its way back to the speculator's 
pocket. 

Mr. W. E. Norris has been airing his opinions on the 
chances of success of new writers. He declares snch 
chances to be practically not given, because of the 
enormous success of a few novelists. There is much in 
this ; but not everything. Mr. Norris forgets that with 
the increase of success has come a keener competition 
for snch writers among publishers, and also an increase 
in the number of publishers themselves. Since, how- 
ever, all the publishers cannot have the few who are 
assured of popularity, many new writers are eagerly 
sought for by the expectant few who are left waiting, 
and these live for the purpose of " discovering " a rising 
genius, and in the hope of nursing and advertising him 
into fame; so that the the new writer never had a bet- 
ter chance of a hearing than he has to-day. There 
never was a time when there were so many really clever 
journalists and literary workers, and the publisher 
knows it. Then, too, there is a tendency toward cheaper 
forms of publications; and we shall eventually arrive at 
the form of the French yellow-back brochure, and issue 
our light literature at two-and-sixpence, or three-and- 
sixpence. The time shall be when an author may truly 
call himself popular, since he will count his readers by 
hundreds of thousands. It goes withont saying, that 
such a method of publishing will send the "subscrip- 
tion library " to the wall. Well, there is not much to 
regret in that possibility. The subscription library in 
this country has served its purpose, and must of ne- 
cessity be extinguished, or die of want of support. 
People who want to read books they cannot afford to 
buy will go to our public libraries, when these are as 
excellently served and managed as are yours. Then 
the bookseller will have his chance, and will have 
no cause to complain of poor business and no " living 
wage." 

So far, I have heard not a word from your side of 
the water which would lead me to believe that you 
have seen the publications of the Vale Press. I think 
you ought to have them. The books are published by 
Messrs. Hacon & Ricketts from type specially designed 
by Mr. Charles Ricketts, and with illustrations drawn 
and cut on wood by the same artist. The editions are 
very small, and must soon find their way into the libra- 
ries of collectors. Personally, I prefer the Vale type 
to the Kelmscott it is more in accordance with the 
best traditions of printing. 

The new weekly which is to rise out of the ashes of 
" The New Review " is being " made ready " as fast as 
money and good brains can make it. It is to be a sort 
of three-penny " Spectator " with more space to be de- 
voted to literature, art, and the drama, than to politics 
and " questions of the day." We are to have the first 
number some time in February. Goodness alone knows 
if it is coming to stay. We have tried here again and 
again to make successful rivals to our older weeklies; 
but somehow or other, they don't keep long. "The 
Realm," "The British Review," "The National Ob- 
server," are among such sorrowful examples. I am 
beginning to be dogmatic on the matter of new journals, 
and to say that even the most richly backed can stand 
no chance of life, without it come with quite a new pur- 
pose to fulfil, a new aim to achieve, and a new expres- 
sion with which to captivate and convince.

LITERARY NOTES. 

" A Mental Arithmetic," by Dr. William J. Milne, is 
among the most recent publications of the American 
Book Co. 

Messrs. Leach, Shewell, & Company publish a text of 
"M. Tnlli Ciceronis Laelius de Amicitia," edited by 
Professor Charles E. Bennett. 

" Sketches in Prose " is the title of Volume II. in the 
handsome new edition, published by the Messrs. Scrib- 
ner, of the writings of Mr. James Whitcomb Riley. 

" The Lyric Poems of John Keats," edited by Mr. 
Ernest Rhys, forms a new volume in the exquisite " Lyric 
Poets " series published by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. 

The W. L. Allison Co. announce for early publication 
" Meir Ezofoviteh," a romance of Jewish life in Poland, 
translated by Iza Young from the Polish of Eliza 
Orzeszko. 

" Water Color Painting," by Miss Grace Barton Allen, 
is " a book of elementary instruction for beginners and 
amateurs " which has just been published by Messrs. 
Lee & Shepard. 

" Freshman Composition," by Mr. Henry G. Pearson, 
is a small and intelligent text-book, provided with an 
introduction by Mr. Arlo Bates. Messrs. D. C. Heath 
& Co. are the publishers. 

" A Narrative of the Indian and Civil Wars in Vir- 
ginia in the Tears 1675 and 1676," as published in 
Boston, in 1814, forms Number 10 of Mr. George P. 
Humphrey's " American Colonial Tracts." 

The American Book Co. are the publishers of " A 
School History of the United States," by Professor John 
Bach McMaster, whose name is sufficient to place the 
book in the highest rank among manuals of its class. 

The death of " Lewis Carroll " will no doubt create 
a new demand for his " Alice " books, and a rise in the 
prices of the first editions. The " Alice " books have 
already brought as much as 824, when in good con- 
dition. 

Professor Ralph S. Tarr is the author of a pamphlet, 
published by the Macmillan Co., entitled " Suggestions 
for Laboratory and Field Work in High School Geology," 
and designed to accompany the " Elementary Geology " 
of the same writer. 

" Studies in European and American History," which 
is " an introduction to the source study method in his- 
tory," is the work of Professors F. M. King and H. W. 
Caldwell of the University of Nebraska, and is published 
at Lincoln by Mr. J. H. Miller. 

" A History of the United States for Schools," by 
Mr. Wilbur F. Gordy, is the latest candidate for the 
favor of grammar-school teachers. It is a volume of 
nearly five hundred abundantly illustrated pages, and is 
published by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Two more volnmes from the inexhaustible treasure- 
house of Dumas are presented by Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. in English translation. One of these volumes is 
"The Horoscope"; the other contains "Monsieur de 
Chauvelin's Will " and " The Woman with the Velvet 
Necklace." 

The American Library Association will hold its twen- 
tieth annual conference at Lakewood-on-Chautauqua, 
July 2-11, 1898. In place of the trip that usually 
follows the meeting, a " Post Conference Rest "has been 
planned for the week following, which the many attrac- 
tions of the Chantauqna region will doubtless make a

pleasant substitute for the customary excursion. An 
invitation is extended to all who are interested in library 
matters, and information will be supplied by Miss Mary 
E. Hazeltine, of the Prendergast Library, Jamestown, 
New 'York. 

Parables for School and Home," by Mr. W. P. Gar- 
rison, is a collection of educational homilies addressed 
ostensibly to children, but really designed quite as much 
for the guidance of teachers and parents. The book is 
illustrated, and published in unusually attractive style 
(for a school-book) by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

Red covers of the most lurid hue envelope the new 
edition of " A Man and a Woman," by Mr. Stanley 
Waterloo, which has just been published by Messrs. 
Way & Williams. It would not be fair to call the color 
a symbol of the contents, although the story is very un- 
conventional, and deals in an unusually frank way with 
some of the aspects of passion. 

The Funk & Wagnalls Co. have just published a 
" student's edition " of their " Standard Dictionary of 
the English Language." The scheme of this work em- 
braces sixty thousand words, illustrated by upwards of 
a thousand cuts, and provided with the usual appendices, 
besides some unusual ones. The volume is compact, 
and contains over nine hundred pages. 

Dr. James Hutchison Sterling's " The Secret of 
Hegel " has long been the standard English exposition 
of the Hegelian philosophy. We therefore welcome the 
new and carefully revised edition of the work that has 
just appeared from the press of the Edinburgh pub- 
lishers, and is sold in this country with the imprint of 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. It makes a big octavo 
volume of 750 pages. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. have reissued their 1889 
edition of Taine's " English Literature." The work is 
in four handsome volumes, boxed, with buckram covers, 
and twenty-eight portrait illustrations. Mr. R. H. Stod- 
dard's introduction is a pleasant feature of this edition, 
which is the most satisfactory for library use that we 
have in English. The translation is, of course, the 
familiar one of Henry Van Laun. 

A sale of interest to collectors of old English books 
will take place Feb. 21 and 22 at the auction rooms of 
Messrs. Flersheim, Barker & Severn, 183 Wabash Ave., 
Chicago. Among the specially noteworthy items to be 
offered are a large-paper copy of Dibdin's Bibliomania, 
with portrait and illustrations, 1876, a set of Malone's 
edition of Shakespeare, 1790, and a rare edition, 1516, 
of the Biblia Latina. A full catalogue may be had on 
application. 

"The Pamphlet Library," edited by Mr. Arthur 
Waugh, is the latest of series to call for a word of com- 
mendation. We have received two volumes of " Literary 
Pamphlets," edited by Mr. Ernest Rhys, and a single 
volume of " Political Pamphlets," edited by Mr. A. F. 
Pollard. Volumes devoted to religion and the drama 
are also contemplated in the editor's scheme. Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. are the American publishers of this 
useful series. 

The Werner School Book Co. has just published 
new editions of Professor B. A. Hinsdale's books, 
" Studies in Education " and " The American Govern- 
ment," and at the same time, designed for use with the 
latter work, a little pamphlet called " Training for Citi- 
zenship," which discusses in competent and practical 
fashion the teaching of civics in the public schools, and 
provides many useful suggestions for those engaged in 
that difficult and important work.

BIRD NEIGHBORS. 

An introductory acquaintance with 150 Birds commonly found 
in the woods, fields, and gardens about our homes. Text by 
NBLTJB BIANCHAN. Introduction by JOHN BURROUGHS. 

Fifty-two Superb Colored Plates. 

From, the Introduction. " When I began the study of birds 
I had access to a copy of Audubon, which greatly stimulated 
my interest in the pursuit ; but I did not have the opera glass, 
and I could not take Audubon with me on my warns, as the 
reader may this volume, and he will find these colored plates 
as helpful as those of Audubon or Wilson." 

New Edition, Octavo, Cloth, $2.00. 

The strength of the effort now being made to introduce the observ- 
ance of Bird Day into the public schools of the United States indicates 
the value placed by educators upon the study of birds in stimulating a 
love of nature, and teaching lessons in humane treatment of all living 
things, and cultivating powers of quick, exact observation in children's 
minds. Bird enthusiasm, once kindled, remains to the end one of the 
most interesting, enjoyable, and healthful recreations, both at home 
and afield.

STANDARD ENGLISH CLASSICS 



THIS SERIES has been undertaken in the 
belief that teachers of English in second- 
ary schools desire the English classics offered 
to their pupils in a form that will not only 
fully meet the college requirements, but will at 
the same time have the flavor of real literature 
and not of the class-room only. 

The Series will, therefore, include the books 
prescribed by the Joint Conference of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools for reading and study, 
and other classics suitable for light work in 
secondary schools. They will be edited by 
competent scholars, with special reference to 
the college requirements. 

The first volumes of the Series have already 
been issued in paper and boards, but will here- 
after be bound in cloth.

In two medium octavo volumes, Mr. Bodley aims to give a concise description of the country, its people and

Commonwealth," etc.

Book II. The Constitution and the Chief of the State. 
VOLUME II. : Book III. The Parliamentary System. 

Book IV. Political Parties. 
Each volume contains an adequate index. 

" Mr. Bodley's considerable work on France is a book of political philosophy, but one in which the philosophy 
is so much disguised by the lightness produced by constant modern and personal illustration that it will be possible 
for the general reader to digest its contents without knowing how much philosophy he has read. . . . The

THE BROOM OF THE WAR -GOD. 

A Story of the Recent War between the Greeks and Turks. 

By HENRY NOEL BRAILSFORD. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

This remarkable picture of the actual conditions in the Greek army 
during the recent war is drawn by a new author of exceptional promise 
who served in the Foreign Legion. There are glimpses of Lamia, 
Pharsala, Larissa, Volo, Velestino, and Domoko. The author was one 
of the disorganized and leaderless assemblage which constituted the 
Greek army, and his wonderfully graphic sketches of the conditions in 
the ranks, the incompetence of officers, and the attitude of the King 
and Crown Prince toward the war, shed a new light upon the disasters 
of the campaign.

A book by the distinguished editor of the " International Education

cavalry general, Auguste Margueritte, who fell at the battle of Sedan ; 
and the youngest son, Victor, was himself an officer in the French 
army, but recently abandoned the military career in order to associate 
himself with his brother in literary work.

THE BOOK AND THE CUSTOM-HOUSE. 

The recently compiled statistics of the United 
States Treasury, relating to our imports for the 
fiscal year which ended with last June, offer a 
mine of valuable material for the worker in 
economic science and the student of commercial 
or industrial problems. With the mass of this 
material we are not at present concerned, but 
the figures relating to " books and printed mat- 
ter " are of such interest to the constituency of 
THE DIAL as to bespeak a few words of com- 
ment. The following table gives the value of 
both free and dutiable imports of the class now 
considered as passed through the custom-houses 
of eleven customs districts. 

msTRTCT BoOKS *** PMSTED MATTBE. 

Free. Dutiable. 

New York $1,310,925 $1,110,476 

Boston 134,356 97,388 

Philadelphia 56,477 44,384 

Chicago 64,502 33,912 

St. Louis 47,642 2,174 

Baltimore 21,037 10,765 

Providence 26,802 438 

Vermont 20,768 3,646 

Cincinnati 12,977 2,916 

New Haven 15,128 567 

Minneapolis 10,860 1,009 

Total for eleven districts, $1,721,474 $1,307,675 

Total for entire country, 1,806,476 1,373,230 

It will be seen that nearly all of the printed 
matter imported is entered in the eleven dis- 
tricts above given, and the first noticeable fact 
revealed by inspection of the figures is that very 
few books pass through custom-houses west of 
the Mississippi River. Less than five per cent 
of the whole is specifically unaccounted for in 
the above table, and of this five per cent about 
one-fifth comes to California ports of entry. 
These facts do not mean, of course, that few 
books from abroad find their way into the trans- 
Mississippi section of the country, but rather 
that our foreign printed matter, which naturally 
comes across the Atlantic, is mostly entered at 
Eastern ports, and afterwards distributed by 
importing booksellers and library agents. It 
must also be remembered that the claim of New 
York to three-fourths of the total importation 
by no means indicates that all of these books 
are intended for local consumption. Still, it is 
only natural to expect that New York, Boston, 
Philadelphia, and Chicago should be, in about 
this order, the four chief ports of entry for 



136 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



printed matter. Chicago gets more free books 
than Philadelphia, but the difference is more 
than compensated for by the larger dutiable 
importation of the latter city. 

One is at once struck by the discrepancy 
between the free and the dutiable importation 
of several of the ports included in the list. St. 
Louis, for example, with a ratio of twenty-four 
to one, New Haven with a ratio of nearly thirty 
to one, and Providence, with a ratio of over 
sixty to one, are the most noticeable instances. 
A moment's reflection, however, will explain 
this anomaly, since the three cities named are 
university and library centres, and without 
their free books for these institutions, would 
sink into insignificance as book importing com- 
munities. It is evident, also, that the exemp- 
tion from duty of all books purchased by pub- 
lic libraries and educational institutions permits 
nearly sixty per cent of our importations to 
come in without paying tribute to the modern 
robber-barons of the custom-house. For this 
relief much thanks ; and yet, when we scan the 
footings-up of the columns, it is clear that a 
still more important moral remains to be 
pointed. 

For what do these figures signify, after all, 
in their bearing upon our attitude as a nation 
toward scholarship and enlightenment? Simply 
this : that for a paltry addition of one-third of 
a million dollars to our revenue, we submit 
every scholar in the country to a petty exaction, 
if not to a great personal annoyance, whenever 
he needs for his work some book not "made in 
America." Not only do we levy this tax upon 
consignments of books, but we even ransack the 
personal luggage of the returning traveller, 
and, pettier still, tear open the wrappings of 
everything like a book that comes from abroad 
by post, for fear that some poor teacher or stu- 
dent or man of letters should find it too easy 
to pursue his calling, or that the rising gener- 
ation should be lured away from material pur- 
suits by the too manifest delights of the schol- 
astic ideal. The notion that the paths of cul- 
ture should be smoothed rather than made 
rugged by public initiative has not yet pene- 
trated into theconsciousnessof the average legis- 
lator, and the tax upon knowledge still stands, 
and probably will stand for another generation, 
as a complete refutation of the pretence that 
as a nation we care seriously for the interests 
of culture. 

We have no intention of repeating upon this 
occasion the well-worn arguments against the 
tax upon imported books. They need no 



iteration for intelligent people, and they are 
quite meaningless to " statesmen " of our fav- 
orite type. But the amazing folly of such a tax 
is something that it may be possible, by dint of 
persistent hammering, to drive into the heads 
of the politicians who are responsible for the 
perpetuation of this form of barbarism. The 
tax is supposed to be laid in the interests of 
protection, although it would be a topsy-turvy 
logic that could show any industry to be pro- 
tected by such an import, but do its supporters 
realize that it creates in every scholar and lover 
of books an implacable enemy of the policy of 
which it is so unwisely held to be a part, of 
any policy, indeed, that could possibly be turned 
to so perverse a purpose ? A third of a million 
dollars is added to our revenue say one fif- 
tieth of the amount that might be added by a 
barely perceptible increase of the tax upon beer, 
and for this an artificial barrier is built up 
against the intercourse of thought, an obstacle 
is set in the path of every seeker after culture, 
a proclamation is made to the civilized world 
that our country imposes a penalty upon learn- 
ing. We are well aware that there is no pros- 
pect for years to come of the abandonment of 
this foolish and ignorant policy, but it can never 
be quite unseasonable to hold it up to scorn, for 
it is only by aiding in the slow growth of a more 
enlightened public opinion upon subjects which, 
like this, do not appeal to the selfish interests 
of the masses, that it can ever become possible 
for the cultured "remnant" to make an effec- 
tive exercise of its beneficent influence upon 
the stolid democracy of which it is a part. 



FRENCH GENIUS IN CRITICISM. 

Last year there came to our shores one whom I 
suppose we may call the foremost literary critic of 
France ; and if that position is justly his, then we 
have had the honor of entertaining the leading critic 
of our day. In that statement I do not ignore 
the literary excellence of the critiques of Mr. An- 
drew Lang, Dr. Georg Brandes, or Mr. Edmund 
Clarence Stedman. Bat these men are, to a cer- 
tain degree, exotic in that brilliant generalization 
which characterizes and has always characterized the 
French genius in criticism. In M. Ferdinand Brune- 
tiere, however, we have the traditions of his race at 
work in genetic exegesis. 

The modern science of criticism had its birth in 
France ; and while there have been as many shades 
to its critical taste as are to be found on the paint- 
er's board, yet through canons of taste logically 
derived, or through its wide-reaching influence, it 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



137 



stands supreme in modern criticism. The French 
mind is de natura critical ; the intellectuality of that 
country is preeminently systematic. Criticism, to 
have the permanency of art, must be synthetic ; there 
must be order, precision, lucidity ; the mind must be 
exact and mathematical. Whenever the motley 
array of disorganized thought comes under the direc- 
tion of such a power, there must necessarily be the 
orderly march of ideas. This has been the living 
force of the French mind in the progress of the 
world. It has given a continuity to its own litera- 
ture such as no other modern literature possesses ; 
and, further, it has crystallized and generalized, in 
the modern development, the mass of data which the 
reverie of the North and the metaphor of the South 
have placed at its door. I do not mean to say that 
the other modern literatures have not had critical 
periods in which to stop and think, and thus, with 
the elimination of insignificant detail, to catch the 
spirit of their drifting, and to prepare themselves 
anew for that utterance which is but the voice of 
their age. If we look at this closely, however, it 
seems to me that we must certainly see that with the 
Teutonic race the periods of profitable criticism are 
the exception. In the " Querelle des Anciens et des 
Modernes," which is nothing but the struggle of tem- 
peramental forces in literature and in life, we find all 
sense of proportion and perspective lost to England 
and to Germany. Leasing stands a monument to the 
refutation of that statement ; and if a man were not 
known by the company he keeps, I should be 
inclined to include Addison. It may be thought 
strange that Pope is not included here ; but to me 
it seems that in his attempt to lie on the bed that 
Boileau laid for him he is another example of a 
spirit out of his time too shallow or too expedient 
to serve as true critic. 

The critics of America, England, or the continent, 
who hold to-day the ear of the people, are those that 
have drank deep and copious draughts at the in- 
spired fount of French criticism : Matthew Arnold, 
Mr. George Saintsbury, Mr. Edmund Gosse; Dr. 
Georg Brandes, whose " HauptstrOmungen in der 
Litteratur des XIX. Jahrhunderts " has been epoch- 
making throughout Germany and Scandinavia. 

The claim for the superiority of French criticism 
does not ex necessitate speak for the intellectual 
superiority of the race, quite the contrary. The 
abandon of untold riches which characterizes the 
Teutonic race may be preferred to the orderly 
arrangement of limited wares ; our sympathy may 
be with the Goth, but we cannot refuse our admi- 
ration to the classic poise and hauteur of the effete 
Latin, with his blood tingling with the despair of the 
Vandal and the impetuous ardor of the Celt. It is 
merely the question of creation or exegesis : Jesus 
Christ will always stand for more than Strauss or 
Renan. 

As said above, it is the love of synthesis, of 
orderly review, that is characteristic of French life 
in letters. I know of no nation that is so fond of 
recapitulation and of inventory of stock in trade. As 



early as the middle of the sixteenth century, we 
stand not infrequently in the presence of such books as 
" Receuil de 1'Origine de la Langne et Poe'sie Fran- 
gaise," in which we have extracts and the glimmer 
of critical generalization which is so brilliant with 
them now. It was the same love of order and epi- 
tome that caused the epigrammatic French to con- 
ceive the first newspaper in the modern sense of the 
word, the " Gazette de France," which appeared at 
the beginning of the seventeenth century under no 
less a sponsor than Cardinal Richelieu, whose devo- 
tion to centralization is typical of all which that 
idea stands for; it is the animus of the French Acad- 
emy, where the validity of censorship in literature 
is vested in its constructed models ; it is what makes 
practicable the sovereignty of kings, with their 
motto of I'etat, c'est moi incised on a background 
oi fleur-de-lis ; and, above all, it is the reason that, 
despite the intellectuality of individual French Pro- 
testants, the creative period of the nation has been 
under the influence of Holy Church, whose theme 
and purpose is centralization and synthesis. 

Coordination and the harmony of related parts 
is what the French mind has sought, and according 
to which it has worked. There has always been sym- 
metry of the various faculties. Eclecticism, to the 
exclusion of one, has indeed, in this sweep of years, 
occurred; but, from the "Principes de literature" 
of Charles Battenx, which were derived from the 
study of Aristotle, and, in connection with Winckel- 
mann's "Gesehichte der Kunst des Alterthums," 
may have influenced Lessing's " Laokoon," to Vic- 
tor Cousin's " Le Vrai, le Beau, et le Bien," there 
are but sporadic suggestions of it. 

This explains to us why those most picturesque 
historical summaries of the French have treated of 
revolutions at times of storm and stress ; why the 
historical genius has sought mediaeval themes at 
times of Romantic unrest ; why, during periods of 
classical reaction, it has sought its inspiration in 
sunny Greece. In explanation of this I am tempted 
to cite the revolutionary themes of Thiers, of 
Tocqueville, of Mignet, of Michelet, of Edgar 
Quinet ; but I refrain, through length of titles, from 
doing so. Suffice it to say that the revolutions of 
England, America, France, Greece, and Italy have 
received at least fair treatment in their hands. 
Victor Durny's classical histories, which are now so 
popular throughout Europe and America, were made 
possible through the quiescent Romantic fervor, 
which, just preceding it, had seen the advent of his- 
tories of the Crusades and of the Middle Ages. 

The philosophy and science of France have been 
no exception to this agreement. Momentary aber- 
rations in philosophy, such as the Port Royal letters 
of Pascal, which were directed against the Jansen- 
ists, with proper perspective, receive proper value. 
And its science may yet have to declare, au fond de 
ses creusets, as M. Paul Adam says, the discovery of 
the divine principle in art, " music, painting, and 
poetry, as the triple reflection of one central light."

A COMPLETE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SPORT.* 

Sportsmen, of whatever class or predilection, 
can scarcely complain that their interests have 
been neglected of late years by book publishers. 
The literature of sport has grown apace ; and 
we are now called upon to chronicle the appear- 
ance of what may be regarded as the outcome 
of the first serious effort to produce an ade- 
quate Encyclopaedia of Sport. When com- 
pleted, the work will stand without a rival in 
its peculiar field. It at once supplants its only 
considerable predecessor, Elaine's " Encyclo- 
pedia of Rural Sports," which first appeared 
in 1840, and which ran through many editions 
between that date and 1870. Elaine's book 
was a good one in its day, but its day is past. 
Certain favorite sports football and cricket, 
for instance have been fairly revolutionized 
since Elaine wrote ; while some others now in 
vogue have been introduced or popularized 
since his time. With the classic work of the 
scholarly Strutt, whose " Sports and Pastimes 
of the People of England " mirrors a not unim- 
portant phase of the history of the Anglo-Saxon 
race, the one now before us hardly enters into 
competition. Strutt's book is valuable mainly 
as a mine of antiquarian lore, and has little 
pretension to encyclopaedic scope or fulness. 

Between the present work and its two prede- 
cessors there is another important point of dif- 
ference. Strutt, and in the main Elaine, worked 
single-handed ; while the volume we are now 
considering is the result of expert collaboration. 
The editor, the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire, 
states that, in answer to his appeal for special 
articles, leading authorities on every branch 
of sport have placed their services at his dis- 
posal. Glancing over the table of contents one 
finds that the articles, for instance, on Angling, 
Archery, Boxing, Fencing, Lacrosse, Broad- 
sword, and Canoeing, are from the pens of 
Messrs. John Bickerdyke and William Senior, 
Col. W. Walrond, Messrs. B. J. Angle, Canaille 
Prevost, E. T. Sachs, A. Hutton, and W. 
Baden-Powell, respectively. Under generic and 
comprehensive titles, such as Hunting, Big 
Game, Camping Out, are groups of specific

and so on. The less important and unsigned 
articles have been submitted to expert revisal, 
and the glossaries under each subject should be 
especially helpful to the inquiring tyro. The 
scope of the work is wide, and intelligent sports- 
men will welcome the inclusion of special arti- 
cles full of practical hints and suggestions on 
such germane and important topics as First 
Aid, Taxidermy, and Veterinary Work. 

Natural history (mainly, of course, from the 
sportsman's point of view) has not been neg- 
lected, and American readers will be glad to 
note that Mr. Theodore Roosevelt is a leading 
contributor in this department. The important 
articles on Cycling (Mr. H. Graves and the 
Countess of Malmesbury) and Golf (Mr. Gar- 
den H. Smith) occupy thirty pages and eigh- 
teen pages respectively. The former article is 
perhaps open to the criticism from the Ameri- 
can point of view that it is addressed too exclu- 
sively to English readers. A half-dozen or so 
pages on American " wheels " and " wheeling " 
would, we think, be a decided improvement in 
a work manifestly intended largely for circula- 
tion in this country. We may add in this con- 
nection that elsewhere in the volume a desire on 
the part of the editor to meet the special needs 
of American sportsmen is apparent. American 
angling and hunting are not neglected ; a table 
of Best American Amateur Records is given 
under the head of Athletics ; there is a well- 
written generally descriptive article on Base- 
ball ; Mr. J. Turner Turner writes on Ameri- 
can Camping Out ; and Mr. Caspar Whitney 
discusses American Football in his usual thor- 
ough and readable way. We hope to find in 
the forthcoming volume adequate papers on 
American Rowing and Yachting ; and we ven- 
ture to suggest that for the treatment of the 
former topic no better man could be selected 
than that veteran oarsman and loyal Yale 
coach, Mr. Robert J. Cook. Such an article by 
Mr. Cook might well be supplemented by a 
few pages from the pen of Mr. R. C. Lehmann, 
the famous Oxford and " Leander " coach and 
beau-ideal of the English " gentleman ama- 
teur." Even the warmest adherents of the 
Cornelian or the Light Blue must feel a lurk- 
ing sympathy with Mr. Lehmann in his present 
chivalrous undertaking at Cambridge. A brief 
resume by Mr. Lehmann of his impressions of

American rowing and rowing men should prove 
a welcome and instructive addition to the pres- 
ent work. 

Thus far the various articles seem to be as a 
rule reasonably full and explicit, when we con- 
sider the necessity the editor and publishers 
are under of attaining a due degree of compre- 
hensiveness of range and treatment without 
expanding the work to an unconscionable num- 
ber of volumes. The term " sport " is a very 
elastic one, and it would not be at all difficult 
to swell a sporting encyclopaedia to the formid- 
able dimensions of a Dictionary of National 
Biography. No man is more enthusiastic, and 
on occasion more fondly loquacious in praise of 
his particular hobby, than the genuine sports- 
man. Your golfer or " wheelman," for instance 
(as so many know to their cost), will go on cheer- 
fully for hours together on their respective pet 
topics when once the tide of their eloquence is 
fairly set flowing ; and we have no doubt that 
the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire has found 
his volunteer contributors very much less diffi- 
cult to secure than to restrain. In one import- 
ant respect, of course, the volume gains by the 
manifest zeal of the writers and their personal 
interest in their several themes. It is unusu- 
ally readable throughout, for an encyclopaedia ; 
and the perfunctory note of the mere hack 
writer is seldom manifest. 

On the score of insufficient and superficial 
treatment of an important topic, we have but 
one special complaint to enter. Mr. A. Alex- 
ander's article on Gymnastics seems to us sur- 
prisingly brief and meagre in view of the 
general thoroughness of the volume. In the 
entirely inadequate space of two pages and a 
half he briefly defines his general term, and 
then proceeds to string together some sixteen 
necessarily indefinite paragraphs on Greek, 
Swedish, German, Danish, Russian, Spanish, 
American, English, and Finn gymnastics, and 
the Educational, Recreative, Acrobatic, and 
Medical systems. We may note in passing, by 
way of showing the disproportion ateness of Mr. 
Alexander's essay, that the writer on Croquet 
has devoted five pages to that simple and mori- 
bund game ; while even that mild form of the 
chase, Butterfly and Moth Catching, comes in 
for over a page and a half of animated descrip- 
tion, at the hands of the same authority. So 
we think Mr. Alexander may justly be charged 
either with injudiciously attempting to cover 
too much ground in the scanty space allotted to 
him, or else, if in the matter of space he was 
left to his own discretion, with underrating and 



slighting a very important subject. As thirty- 
seven pages are given to Cricket, twenty-three 
to Football, twenty-five to Cycling, and twenty- 
three to Angling, we should say that fifteen 
pages to Gymnastics would have been some- 
thing like a proper allotment. Mr. Alexander 
is usually accurate, so far as he goes ; but in one 
instance we think he has made a strikingly 
erroneous statement. In comparing the Swed- 
ish gymnastics with the Finnish, he animad- 
verts upon the "jerky" style of the former 
school. Now if our conception of the theory of 
the excellent system of Preiuebungen known 
as the Swedish Movements be measurably cor- 
rect, " jerkiness " is about the last quality to be 
predicated of them. " Don't jerk ! " " Don't 
move too fast ! " is the constantly repeated 
injunction of every teacher of the Swedish exer- 
cises who has mastered even the alphabet of 
the system. 

The plan of publication of this work, in parts, 
has been adopted, the editor says, in the " con- 
fident expectation that those who buy the ear- 
lier numbers will never rest satisfied without 
the complete series." The initial volume cer- 
tainly goes far to warrant this belief. Mechan- 
ically it is one of the handsomest productions 
of the kind we have ever had the pleasure of 
handling. The illustrations, comprising twenty 
full-page photogravures and a great number of 
vignettes, serve well the dual purpose of adorn- 
ment and instruction. It is a really sumptuous 
work, possessing uses and attractions that 
sportsmen and lovers of fine books generally 
will find hard to resist.

THE XEW ENGLAND PRIMER.* 

Mr. Ford does not succeed in impressing 
his weight as an authority upon his history of 
"The New England Primer," in spite of a 
formidable array of facts and evidences of con- 
siderable study. Both seem to be of too recent 
acquisition for thorough assimilation, while the 
writer himself is not in sufficient sympathy with 
his subject. Yet there is no doubt of his con- 
scientiousness, and this, with the part played by 
the little book in the formation of our national 
character, makes the work one of much interest 
and considerable importance. 

" The New England Primer," this treatise 
discloses, was the combined reading book and

and Development. Edited by Paul Leicester Ford. New

[March 1, 



religious manual placed in the hands of every 
young American in the North from the time of 
its first publication, about the year 1690, until 
its practical supersession a hundred and fifty 
years later. During this time, Mr. Ford esti- 
mates, not less than three millions of copies 
were printed for use in America alone, at the 
rate of twenty thousand a year. Every copy 
contained an Abecedarium, a Syllabarium, and 
an illustrated Alphabet containing such familiar 



verses as 

Young Obadias, 
David, Josias, 
All were Pious. 



Zacheus he 

Did climb the Tree 

His Lord to see. 



These were followed by the " Exhortation unto 
His Children," attributed to John Rogers, to 
be referred to later in this article ; a Cate- 
chism ; and, sometimes, the Lord's Prayer, the 
Apostles' Creed, and the Ten Commandments. 
The most notable original contribution of the 
Primer to literature is found for the first time 
in a London edition dated 1781, given anony- 
mously and without punctuation, as follows : 

Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
If I should die before I wake 
I pray the Lord my soul to take 

which, having been included in all subsequent 
reprints, came to assume something of the 
importance of the Lord's Prayer itself. 

The word primer is derived by Professor 
Skeat from Prime, the first of the canonical 
hours, by the addition of the English suffix er. 
A book of hours would naturally take its name 
from the first of them, and Mr. Ford himself 
shows that in 1490 " A larger book of Catho- 
licism (sic) . . . was the well-known * Book of 
Hours '; which, translated from the Latin text 
into English, was called ' The Prymer of Salis- 
bury Use.' " His surmise concerning the word, 
set forth thus, " The authorized primers were 
not school books being rather primary hence 
* primer ' manuals of church service," is an 
unfortunate and unnecessary guess. Etymology 
aside, Henry VIII. is found authorizing the 
publication of these little books both for and 
against the Church of Rome, and they were 
afterward condemned by the Council of Trent. 
Until the flight of James II., the English mon- 
archs successively published their own and for- 
bade the use of their predecessors' primers. 
About the year 1686, one Benjamin Harris, 
having embroiled himself with the British gov- 
ernment by printing some ultra Protestant 
pamphlets, came to Massachusetts. He it was 
who had published, according to one authority, 



" The Protestant Tutor " before his flight, and 
Mr. Ford also gives him the distinction of 
bringing out the first American newspaper 
called " Public Occurrences," and suppressed 
by proclamation almost before it was made 
public. The first edition of " The New En- 
gland Primer " was printed for Harris ; it bears 
strong resemblance to the other work from his 
hand ; he was such a writer and rhymester as 
would be likely to deliver himself of the con- 
tents of the two books ; and there seems to be 
no reason for disputing his authorship of the 
latter. 

The Primer filled a want in the life of New 
England. The Puritan, as Mr. Ford points 
out, sought book-learning chiefly for the sake 
of reading The Book " the single book," as 
Lowell says, " with whose language he is inti- 
mate." To this end, the mingling of spelling, 
reading, and dogmatic theology in the Primer 
contributed in the safest and most practical way. 
Its popularity was both immediate and endur- 
ing, as has been shown. But the editor here 
misses a golden opportunity, in not giving some 
notion of the geographical extent of its influ- 
ence. He mentions, casually enough, that it 
made its way into parts of New York and 
Pennsylvania. Whether the Primer penetrated 
into the other colonies, and what, if any, influ- 
ence it had there, is not set forth, nor is there 
anything to show that any investigation was 
made in that behalf. Still, its circulation was 
so great that it is a matter for surprise that 
not more than forty examples of all the impres- 
sions made during the seventeenth and eigh- 
teenth centuries have come down to us. All 
that are known to be extant are described in 
this book, and their prices, running into the hun- 
dreds of dollars, given in detail. There seems 
to be no possible reason for not mentioning the 
price they commanded at the time of their pub- 
lication as well. Mr. Ford attributes the 
scarcity of these early examples to the natural 
destructiveness of childhood and " the slight 
value set by adults on children's books of their 
own time." A more potent factor would be 
their " slight value " in the most literal senses 
their exceeding cheapness, commonness, and 
flimsiness ; for New England thrift can be de- 
pended upon to prevent the destruction of any- 
thing costly, now as then. 

Mr. Ford's errors of detail are many, and 
most conspicuous on the side of religious terms. 
On one hand, he is addicted to the use of the 
offensive word " Romish "; on the other, he 
insists not only upon confounding Puritans and 



1898.] 



THE DIAL, 



141 



Separatists, but upon treating the terms as 
absolutely synonymous. Then, though the 
Puritans of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay 
were unquestionably members of the Church of 
England, he goes on to style them "the dis- 
senters of America," a most astonishing de- 
scription of men who held to a church estab- 
lished by law, and persecuted all who did not 
come within it. By way of completing the 
cycle, the Church of England is styled " Epis- 
copalian," even in ante-Revolutionary times. 
A more excusable blunder makes George II. 
father to George III., instead of grandfather. 
But the commentator goes wrong again in 
speaking of the familiar and highly orthodox 
couplet, 

Whales in the sea 

God's voice obey, 

as containing a "somewhat difficult rhyme." 
If knowledge of scores of similar rhymes in 
Harris's day does not suffice, Mr. Henry Sweet's 
statement is authoritative : that sea and obey 
were perfect rhymes until " the middle of the 
18th cent.," and, as a matter of course, until a 
later day in the colonies. The division, in the 
Syllabarium and elsewhere, of words like " be- 
ne-fi-ci-al " and " temp-ta-ti-on," should have 
shown the writer that he was dealing with the 
pronunciation of another day than his own. 
There is no good reason, at the present day, 
for wasting sympathy over the Puritan babes 
who had to learn by rote the tremendous doc- 
trines and uncouth doggerel of the Primer ; but 
it is a serious matter, nevertheless, and Mr. 
Ford's continued sprightliness of manner jars 
from page to page. Most unfortunate is the 
collection of ancient doctrinal jests on pages 
52 and 53, used as a climax to the " Introduc- 
tion " and quite unworthy the dignity of both 
book and writer. 

It is a pleasure to turn to Mr. Ford's better 
manner, as an example of which his treatment 
of the fables clustering around John Rogers, 
first of the Marian martyrs, may be cited. The 
"Exhortation unto His Children " of the Primer 
is prefaced by the time-honored statement that 
" His wife, with nine small children, and one at 
her Breast, follow'd him to the Stake," the 
ambiguity of which phrase gave rise to a con- 
troversy, some centuries in duration, over the 
number of the offspring, some engravers group- 
ing nine and some ten children about their 
devoted mother. Mr. Ford shows that the 
verses were not written by Rogers at all, but by 
Robert Smith, another martyr ; he quotes Foxe 
to prove that Rogers's wife and children were 



not witnesses of his execution, and settles the 
number of the progeny by a further quotation 
from the martyrologist wherein the children 
are said to be " eleven in number, ten able to 
go, and one sucking at the breast," reconciling 
this with Rogers's own testimony that he had 
ten children by showing that the eleventh came 
into the world unknown to him after he had 
been shut up tight in jail. 

The feature of chief interest in the work, 
particularly for those who have seen but do not 
possess the original Primer, is the faithful 
reproduction of its rude typography, paper, and 
woodcuts, the latter so extremely crude that 
in some cases the picture of a king, used as a 
frontispiece to the Primer, was not only made 
to serve for his successor, but, the Revolution 
intervening, a portrait of George III. actually 
did duty for John Hancock ! And as a proof 
of the innocency of our forefathers, the cut of 
a Queen from a pack of playing cards " the 
Devil's picture-book " was used as an illus- 
tration in one edition of the Primer without 
rebuke, and presumably without intention. 
Mechanically, the work of Mr. Ford's volume 
is admirably done throughout.

SOCIAL PROGRESS IN ENGLAND.* 

The concluding volume of Mr. H. D. Traill's 
" History of Social Life in England " is cast 
upon exactly the same lines as the earlier ones, 
and possesses the same excellences as well as 
many of the defects which they revealed. The 
comments already made in THE DIAL| are 
therefore applicable to it ; the various essays 
differ widely in originality and style, and there 
is a certain amount of repetition as a result of 
treating each department of social life in sever- 
alty : some of the writers have burdened their 
pages too heavily with bare statements of fact, 
instead of giving the vital conclusions which 
they had drawn from scientific study, while 
other writers have omitted the facts necessary 
to sustain their propositions properly ; some- 
times a tone of authority pervades an essay,

and in other instances the subject-matter is left 
in a clearly incomplete condition ; there are 
even contradictory statements made by the 
writers of different essays. Yet the work is 
excellently well done in the main ; even better 
than in the earlier volumes with the possible 
exception of the articles on Agriculture by Mr. 
Bear, and three out of fo,ur of Miss Bateson's 
essays on Manners and Customs. 

The real social life of England the condi- 
tion of the vast mass of the population and the 
progress of democracy is as sparingly treated 
in this as in the other volumes ; and this be- 
comes a more serious defect in the volume 
which deals with recent times. There is lack- 
ing, indeed, that unity of purpose which alone 
is consistent with the diversity of plan involved 
in a work of such composite character as this 
one. There is needed, first, a clear statement 
of the facts which will show in a tangible man- 
ner the way in which present conditions and 
institutions differ from those of an earlier pe- 
riod ; and second, an explanation of the reasons 
why certain results have followed particular 
causes. Such is the plan which alone will 
justify the rewriting of history, and such a plan 
is wanting in the present volume as a whole. 
It is followed out, however, by Professor Mon- 
tague in an essay which is a gem of its kind 
on the History of Law. Miss Bateson's ac- 
count of educational progress in the present 
century is also planned on the same lines. 

The central feature of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, beyond all question, is the material prog- 
ress, particularly of England and America, and 
in a less degree of the world in general. The 
present volume of " Social England " should 
therefore have given this fact its due promi- 
nence ; and the various articles written each by 
an eminent specialist, on trade and agricul- 
ture, art and architecture, language and liter- 
ature, public health, morals, manners, the de- 
velopment of jurisprudence, the church, the 
army, the navy, science, education, religion, 
and so forth, should have shown the relation 
of industrial forces to the other departments of 
social life. In a word, all the contributors to 
this volume should have had clearly in mind a 
definite theory of social progress, and it should 
have been their purpose to explain the action 
and reaction between the different elements of 
our civilization. In this way their efforts would 
have directly contributed to the solution of the 
social problems of the day and to the establish- 
ment of real democracy, both in England and 
his country. Mr. Eiddell should have at least 



enumerated some of the " many social and eco- 
nomic as well as inventive " forces which resulted 
in the development of the textile industries 
(page 69), and have explained why the indus- 
trial revolution was most marked in these in- 
dustries, as well as why it antedated all others 
by nearly a generation. Professor Symes 
should have told us why it was that " as lately 
as 1796 England adopted a system which, in 
less than forty years, reduced almost all agri- 
cultural laborers to a position of pauperism " 
(p. 219), why "the Poor Law authorities of 
London began carting off waggon-loads of pau- 
per children to Lancashire," and why these 
and other children were " swept into factories 
when they could hardly walk " (p. 217). Dr. 
Colville states (p. 243) that before the close 
of 1833 Scotland secured her Municipal Cor- 
porations Bill, in advance of England ; but 
some one of the contributors to this history of 
England in the nineteenth century might prop- 
erly have given more than half a dozen lines to 
the problems of city life and administration, 
and to their influence on civilization. 

These instances are taken at random, but 
they will serve to show the class bias and the 
political affiliations of the writers in Mr. 
Traill's company. In his excellent history of 
law to which reference has been made, Pro- 
fessor Montague not only sets an example to 
his colaborers, but he imposes on them a duty 
which they entirely fail to perform. He em- 
phasizes the fact that the nineteenth century is 
a period of direct legislation, and that a great 
part of our modern statutes has been concerned 
with what it is convenient to call public law ; 
and he goes on to consider those enactments 
which have altered the constitution of the courts 
of justice and the forms of procedure, have 
transformed ancient courts, multiplied new 
ones, amended rules of procedure, and more 
than once revised the whole administration of 
justice. He states, what everyone knows, 
that old departments of administration have 
been reorganized, new departments established, 
and the entire system of local government been 
recast ; but he adds, almost facetiously (p. 
470), that enactments relating to subjects of 
this class, " such as the New Poor Law, the 
Municipal Corporations Acts, the Public 
Health Acts, and so forth, are touched upon in 
other chapters of the present volume." 

Certainly no movement has been more vital 
to the social life of the people of England in 
this century than that for the reduction of the 
hours of labor ; but the subject is barely

" touched upon " in a paragraph of a dozen 
lines (p. 423). The Christian Socialists are 
dismissed with even less, and Henry Hunt is 
not even mentioned. The Chartist movement 
fares a bit better, receiving nearly two pages ; 
but its nominal leader is spoken of as an empty 
braggart (p. 115), and a typical demagogue of 
great physical prowess and considerable ora- 
torical gifts (p. 224). This hardly indicates 
a critical examination of the relation between 
cause and effect hi social life, or a scientific 
explanation of the social progress England has 
been making in this century. Indeed, there is 
but little in the body of the work to justify the 
titles to two of the chapters at least, " The 
Rule of the Middle Class" (1846-1865), and 
"The Succession of Democracy " (1865-1885) . 
Why the population of England has trebled 
during the century, while that of France has 
remained stationary ; what has been the actual 
increase in national wealth, and how this enor- 
mous increase in the supply of the comforts of 
life has been distributed ; why some other dis- 
tribution has not occurred, or could now be 
brought about ; what were the peculiar features 
of middle-class government, and why they were 
not permanent, but were succeeded by demo- 
cratic " influences and tendencies "; how we 
are to secure the blessings of democracy and at 
the same time avoid its dangerous tyrannies ; 
what relation there is and should be between 
the church and the army, and how far physical 
conflict hinders moral elevation ; what are the 
limits of public and national education as a 
socializing force and a power for uplifting man- 
kind : what are the present benefits of muni- 
cipal ownership, and what the necessary limits 
of state activity in industrial enterprises ; 
these and similar subjects are the ones on which 
a reader will seek for guidance in the succes- 
sive volumes of " Social England," and more 
particularly in the closing volume of the series. 
There is one all-important social truth which 
the disjointed character of this work helps to 
enforce, namely, that there must be a certain 
correlation of parts in all social progress : our 
morals must match our money matters, or both 
will go wrong. Slavery, and even serfdom, are 
quite incompatible with large factories ; they 
cannot exist side by side. Poverty and democ- 
racy are equally strangers : if we would have 
the one we must abolish the other. If we would 
preserve to mankind the blessings of great 
wealth which the material progress of the nine- 
teenth century has placed at our disposal, not 
only our laws of property but our notions of 



right and wrong and our ideals of life and con- 
duct must be elevated to a far higher level. It 
is not necessary to mortify the flesh, and clothe 
the body in sackcloth and ashes, because lux- 
urious living tempts a few to abuse the bless- 
ings of wealth ; the higher intellectual tastes 
and aesthetic pleasures should be developed. 
The use of wealth in beautifying the home, 
surrounding it with flowers, filling it with books 
which inspire, and making it a joy to the pass- 
ing wayfarer as well as to the welcome guest ; 
the use of wealth in cleaning the streets, ex- 
tending the parks, erecting pleasant school 
buildings, and making the city an attractive as 
well as a safe abiding place, these, and others 
like them, are the conditions of progress in the 
twentieth century.

THE STUDY or RACES.* 

The second volume of Ratzel's important 
work on " The History of Mankind " (the first 
volume of which was noticed in THE DIAL for 
August 16, 1897) treats of the Americans, the 
Arctic Races of the Old World, and the peo- 
ples of Africa. The discussion of the American 
populations has for us, naturally, the chief 
interest. The author appears to admit the 
unity of the American peoples, but suggests 
that this unity " may be based either on com- 
munity of descent or on long isolation and con- 
sequent assimilation." It is not easy to deter- 
mine to which of the two explanations Mr. 
Ratzel inclines. Personally, we feel that any 
discussion which emphasizes unity, either in 
type or origin, is faulty. Does not every ad- 
vance in the study of the physical anthropology 
of our native tribes show diversity of American 
types ? Not two types, which, as Ratzel says, 
"found support mainly from Topinard and 
Quatrefages," but more than two original types, 
are to be investigated. 

It is inherent in the character of a work like 
this that the material must be condensed. A 
single paragraph must contain matter that 
might easily be expanded into pages. Partly 
as a result of this condensation, but also partly 
through the fault of the writer or translator, the 
statements are frequently obscure or badly 
framed. Thus, in connection with Abipone 
marriages, we are told : " The ceremony is often

very simple, but even so are held perfectly 
binding, especially the silent exchange of pres- 
ents." What are we to make of such a sentence ? 
It is, however, a fair example of the frequently 
faulty style. Without, however, criticising 
small points of detail, we may say that the dis- 
cussion of Americans is as good as so condensed 
a statement can be expected to be. 

Ratzel's description of African populations is 
probably the most important in our language. 
The light-skinned and low-statured peoples of 
Central and South Africa are first considered 
Bushmen, Hottentots, Dwarf Races. Then 
come the Negro races of South and East Africa. 
The discussion is not easy reading. The move- 
ments of the herding and agricultural pop- 
ulations have been numerous and confusing. 
Cultures have been modified in a thousand 
ways. Tribes subdued to-day may be conquerors 
to-morrow. Names have changed and strange 
mimicries and masqueradings have been in- 
dulged in. To disentangle the confused skein 
has been a difficult task, but one, on the whole, 
well done by our author. 

To the student who is not a specialist in 
African ethnography, this book will be of great 
importance for reference. The illustrations are 
especially to be commended. They not only 
handsomely adorn the work, but are of high 
value for study. There is probably no other 
popular work which contains so many fine illus- 
trations of race types and ethnographic objects. 
The third volume will complete the work.

A POPULAR HISTORY OF MODERN SPAIN.* 

The six volumes on the movements and his- 
torical characters of the nineteenth century, 
which Mrs. Latimer has sent forth within the 
last few years, form a series of considerable 
interest, and, on the whole, of permanent value. 
Judging them by the purpose of the author as 
expressed in the several prefaces, and in the 
light of her modest disclaimer of either ability 
or desire to go below the surface and discuss 
the deeper forces that have brought about the 
movements she describes or the profound pro- 
blems suggested, as well as by the needs of the 
" general reader " whose ignorance of contem- 
porary European history is hardly relieved by 
his knowledge of the names of a few of the

Wormeley Latimer. Chicago : A. C. McClurg & Co. 



foremost statesmen and monarchs and generals, 
the present endeavor is to be pronounced suc- 
cessful. The specialist will find many points 
where from his knowledge of underlying forces 
he can criticize both the form and the substance 
of the statements made. Both the books give 
mainly pictures of the court life of the several 
countries, descriptions of the personal charac- 
teristics of kings and ministers and leaders of 
revolution, and accounts of the superficial 
aspects of the changes of government of which 
the century has seen so many ; and for work of 
this sort the writer is well equipped by personal 
observation, wide reading, and a pleasant style. 
The many who only care for, or will take the 
trouble to acquire, this degree and this kind of 
acquaintance with the affairs of the century, 
will find these books easy reading ; while, it is 
to be hoped, some will be led on by them to the 
sources of a deeper and truer knowledge of the 
wonderful developments of the century. 

The volumes of the series vary in value, 
that on the opening of Africa, and the present 
volume on Spain, being the most useful, because 
they furnish what cannot be easily got together 
from other works. The volume on Spain is 
especially timely, as it gives that insight into 
Spanish character and history which is necessary 
to the very beginning of an appreciation of the 
Cuban question. Spanish history during the 
last hundred years can hardly be called inter- 
esting to any but the student of social and pol- 
itical forces. It is a tangled maze of tyranny, 
intrigue, and revolution. Spain, until very 
recently, has been back in medievalism ; and 
so far as the average Spaniard's thought and 
belief go, one cannot say that the country has 
yet emerged very far from that condition. This 
is illustrated many times in the present work. 
Spanish pride and ignorance and superstition 
and bloodthirstiness have combined to prevent 
economic progress and to make a real popular 
government impossible. These same qualities 
have caused the loss of Spain's other American 
possessions, and the ruin of Cuba. Yet Spanish 
pride will sacrifice without limit, rather than give 
up this last token of past imperial greatness. 

The sketches given in this work are of such 
interesting characters as Godoy the Prince of 
the Peace, Joseph Bonaparte, King Ferdinand, 
Queens Christina and Isabella, Don Carlos, and 
General Riego ; they are vivid, and group the 
tangled facts about these persons in such a way 
that the story is not hard to follow. Many 
excellent portraits adorn the volume.

MODERN PHASES OF 

The most modern of the distinctively modern 
group of volumes before us is an exposition of " The 
New Psychology," by Professor Scripture of Yale 
University. The newness of things is, or soon comes 
to be, a relative matter : New College at Oxford is 
many centuries old, and the Pont Neuf is by no 
means the most recent of Parisian bridges. How- 
ever defective as a description, the term " New Psy- 
chology" is at least distinctive, and prepares the 
reader for finding within these covers something 
very different from the traditional matter or treat- 
ment of the " Psychologies." In the present instance, 
moreover, we have presented not only a survey of 
recent investigations, and an account of the methods 
and equipment of the modern experimental psy- 
chologist, but we have these presented from a novel 
point of view. There are other more or less recent 
treatises covering a similar ground, and equally 
imbued with the spirit of exact science and with the 
discipline of the laboratory ; but never before has 
this domain been described from so thoroughly and 
consistently an objective standpoint. The volume 
may be characterized as an "objective " psychology : 
the mental processes and activities are viewed 
wholly from without, not from within. The result- 
ing treatment is much like that of a text-book on 
physics ; the physiological side is nearly as little 
represented as the introspective, and the genetic and 
comparative aspects of the subject and these, too, 
are certainly new find little mention. The attempt 
to present such an original and objective study of 
the facts of mental science, whether successful or 
not, is in itself a notable event. However much 
future contributors to this field may differ from 
Professor Scripture in conclusion and in point of 
view, in perspective or in design, they are certain to 
be guided and stimulated by his pioneer effort. The 
importance of the volume is increased by reason of 
the necessity for removing the prevalent false 
impression of the interests and purposes of the mod- 
ern psychologists. Much as we may deplore the 
fact, it is none the less true that the appreciation of 
the services of the modern psychologist suffers from 
a confused notion of his work. It cannot be said 
too emphatically that he is not a dealer in the oc- 
cult, nor an expositor of personal peculiarities, nor 
a physiologist in rather poor disguise, nor an unsci- 
entific controversialist and theorizer. " The New 
Psychology " will do much to counteract this con- 
ception ; it will do this because it exhibits the rigidly

scientific character of method and research indis- 
pensable to true progress ; it emphasizes the tech- 
nical character of the training and attainments 
necessary to qualify one to follow this pursuit ; it in 
no way encourages a dillettante interest in and ap- 
plication of undigested material ; it shows clearly 
what psychology is not. In all these ways, as well 
for its intrinsic merits, the book is both notable and 
useful. 

The volume is divided into five parts : the first 
gives an account of the methods of psychology, and 
describes the importance of observation and experi- 
ment, of measurement and statistics, in the investi- 
gation of mental processes. This portion of the 
work brings to the foreground the close kinship 
between the methods of psychology and those of 
other sciences, the importance of quantitative deter- 
minations, the necessity for watchfulness in detect- 
ing and overcoming sources of error; in brief, it 
shows that a sound logic of method and design is 
as essential to psychology as to any other science. 
The last portion of the book is devoted to an his- 
torical retrospect of the origins and growth of the 
new tendencies in psychology, and to an account of 
the general outlook and the present provisions for 
the advancement of psychological knowledge. In 
this prospect a very creditable position falls to the 
share of cis- Atlantic psychologists. The three inter- 
mediate portions make up the body of the work; 
their titles are Time, Energy, Space, titles 
hardly suggestive of psychological activities. As, 
however, our reactions to the material world in 
which our bodies move and our minds live necessa- 
rily appear as responses to the various forms of 
physical energy, which are again essentially deter- 
mined by temporal and special conditions, it cer- 
tainly becomes possible to prepare under these 
rubrics a systematic account of the nature, limita- 
tions, elaborations, interpretations, and applications 
of such responses. For time relations we begin 
with the fundamental fact that all activities, mental 
as well as others, require time. The times needed 
for the initiation and development of a sensation ; 
for the innervation and execution of an act of will ; 
for interpreting the nature of a stimulus, its dis- 
tinction from others, its symbolic or artificial signi- 
ficance; for recalling familiar bits of knowledge, 
or making simple inferences are all determined 
with as much exactness as the nature of the pro- 
cesses will permit. Our own estimates of the pass- 
ing of time ; our sense of rhythm ; the waning of 
memory-images as time goes on ; the flow of ideas 
in temporal succession, these form additional 
chapters which may be grouped about the " time " 
rubric. 

The methods by which we acquire a knowledge 
of space are similarly treated. The natural divis- 
ion is here followed, taking up in turn the space 
information derived from the movements of our 
body in space, from the impressions of touch, and 
from the varied movements and impressions of 
vision. Energy is represented in all our move-

ments, and hence the nature of muscular contrac- 
tions, the characteristics of fatigue, the perceptions 
of movement, the sensations of resistance and weight 
as well as of sound and color, may all he grouped 
under the term energy ; to which is added, although 
not very consistently, a chapter on pain and one on 
the feelings. 

Such, in outline, is the plan of this work. The 
manner of treatment is selective ; there is no attempt 
at comprehensiveness. Under each head a group of 
observations that seems likely to convey most clearly 
the nature of the methods and results is selected and 
fully described ; preference being always given to 
results in quantitative form. Many of the experi- 
ments are original, and show much ingenuity both 
in the settling of problems and in technical device. 
The unfortunate personal tone of the author's 
" Chautauqua " volume on " Thinking, Feeling, Do- 
ing " is largely, although not wholly, avoided ; while 
but little exception can be taken to the prominence 
given to the studies from the Yale Laboratory, and 
the passing-by, owing to limitations of scope, of 
many important facts and observations. 

While recording one's appreciation of the schol- 
arship and the originality of the compiler, and the 
general success of the compilation, the fundamental 
question as to the possibility of a rigidly objective 
psychology forcibly presents itself. Does not a 
psychology that deals, not with sensation and per- 
ception, not with memory and association, not with 
distinction and choice, that discards the help of care- 
ful self-observation, that instead of these deals with 
time and space and energy, does not such a 
psychology proclaim its own insufficiency? Is not 
this classification one of appearance and not of re- 
ality, objective in the sense of outside and not in- 
trinsic? Is there not as much danger of turning 
psychology into physics as into metaphysics ? These 
are the queries that accompany the critical reader 
from chapter to chapter. As a matter of fact, the 
mental processes of perception, memory, discrimi- 
nation, association, and the like, are touched upon ; 
the objective treatment is frequently abandoned, de- 
signedly or otherwise ; none the less the dominant 
tone and perspective is unpsychological as the term 
is currently understood. Whether it is really so or 
whether its newness is an anticipation of future 
trends, may be more wisely questioned than asserted 
or denied. The rigidly scientific psychology, the 
psychology of experiment and observation, the 
psychology of growth and development, has come 
with the close of the century as a permanent contri- 
bution to the circle of the sciences. Whether the 
particular phase of it selected by Professor Scripture 
is to be in the future the dominant phase cannot yet 
be determined ; but that it will always be a promi- 
nent factor, both in determining the spirit and the 
content of psychological research, can hardly be 
questioned. Under these circumstances, so able and 
useful a compendium as this must be welcomed as 
an important aid to students of all shades and 
grades. 



The " Subconscious Self," by Dr. Louis Wald- 
stein, is a thesis in applied Psychology ; and the 
thesis is admirably maintained and its lessons vig- 
orously enforced. This thesis is based upon the 
recognition of two elements in our mental make-up. 
The conscious side is that generally recognized 
as ourselves, the self that selects the impressions 
upon which we feed, that regulates our conduct, that 
guides and controls our lives. The sub-conscious is 
the sum of the impressionable, receptive tendencies 
that creates our likes and dislikes, that engenders 
our moods and aspirations, that gives shape to our 
peculiarities, our temperament, and character. We 
are very much more than and very different from 
that which we designedly intend to be ; and it is this 
duality which is expressed and elaborated as the 
conscious and the sub-conscious self. There is cer- 
tainly a little danger in this creation of two selves : 
the danger of conceiving them as separate entities 
with independent powers and natures. In the hands 
of a less judicious writer than Dr. Waldstein, this 
conception would be readily abused, and unwar- 
ranted inferences and implication on the part of the 
reader might counteract the wholesome effect of the 
conscious recognition of that less tangible but potent 
factor of our mentality. 

The practical side of the thesis emphasizes the 
importance of early associations and environment, 
because childhood and youth are the impressionable 
ages when we absorb much more than we consciously 
imbibe, when we learn much more than we study, 
when the sub-conscious tendencies are strongest. 
Hence "the surroundings in which the child is taught 
are of more importance, in relation to the ultimate 
degree of culture to be attained, than the lesson ; the 
manner of the teacher than the substance of his 
teaching." " For culture depends upon the impulse, 
not upon purpose." On the side of health, Dr. 
Waldstein maintains that many forms of nervous 
ills are rather in the nature of evil mental habits, 
dependent upon more or less original weakness and 
a disturbance of the normal relations between the 
conscious and the sub-conscious. The mental appeal 
in cases of hysteria and neurasthenia must be in the 
line of a re-establishment of the control of conscious 
effort, to dip down deep and reconstruct the under- 
currents of thought and feeling. The change of 
scene, the absorption in new occupations, the rest 
from conscious strain, and, still more, the relief from 
worry which is so infinitely more wearing than work, 
are effective as they supplant morbid introspective 
moods and feelings by wholesome altruistic interests. 

In the elaboration of his thesis, Dr. Waldstein 
appeals to the evidence of suggestion and hypnotic 
action ; to medical experience and educational exam- 
ples, to the revival of old and apparently forgotten 
memories, to the suggestiveness of certain organic 
and less specialized sensations, for the illustration of 
the nature and importance of the sub-conscious self. 
Some of these illustrations are rather dubious ; but on 
the whole, the argument is moderate and the appli- 
cations suggestive. It is at once a stimulating and

a safe volume, and well adapted to the needs of the 
general but intelligently interested reader. 



Whatever one's opinion of its intrinsic importance, 
there can be no doubt that Psychical Research " 
forms a conspicuous feature in modern mind-lore. 
The term has really been given a technical meaning, 
and serves to distinguish a somewhat heterogeneous 
group of topics, most of which, but not all, have 
some bearings upon psychological principles. There 
is, for instance, nothing psychological about the mys- 
terious ringing of bells and tumbling about of wall 
ornaments, or the tying of knots in an endless cord, 
or the insertion of slips of paper into an apparently 
sealed box, or the alleged miraculous transfer of let- 
ters and documents through space, all of which 
procedures the devout psychic researcher must ex- 
amine and explain, unless it be the contribution 
to the psychology of deception and credulity which 
the description of the true modus operandi of these 
interesting performances reveals. On the other 
hand, researches into the nature of hypnotic phe- 
nomena, of automatism, of secondary forms of 
consciousness, of illusions and hallucinations and 
kindred more or less abnormal forms of mental ac- 
tion, are definitely psychological in scope and signi- 
ficance. The strand that binds the sheaf together is, 
however, the interest in the unusual, the apparently 
miraculous, the possible exception to recognized 
physical laws, the possible discovery of means of 
transcending the limitations of this mortal coil. 
This extreme interest in the supernatural is prob- 
ably not to be ranked as amongst the most cultured 
or worthy of civilized interests, and yet its exist- 
ence must be distinctly recognized and met. There 
is, therefore, a place, and by reason of its power to 
influence opinion, an important place, for a book 
that describes plainly but critically the status of the 
chief forms of nineteenth century supematuralia. 
Such a book is Mr. Podmore's " Studies in Psychical 
Research." 

The phenomena of spiritualism are described with 
rare and commendable patience; the excessive super- 
stition, the absurd logic or want of it, the looseness 
of so-called test conditions, the petty deceits and 
gross frauds, the pitiable credulity of victims and 
the boldness and originality of mediums, are por- 
trayed as calmly as the description of so many 
natural history specimens. The spiritualists " who 
would be capable of testifying, if their preposses- 
sions happened to point that way, that they had 
seen the cow jump over the moon," and would refer 
for corroborative evidence to the archives of the 
nursery, as well as the learned professors who invent 
apparatus for demonstrating the power of the me- 
dium to modify the laws of gravitation, are alike 
given a hearing ; and the resulting verdict is fraud, 
eked out by some hallucinations. One cannot help 
feeling as Faraday felt when investigating similar 
phenomena forty years ago, that ' in the present 
age, and in this part of the world, it [such investi- 
gation] ought not be required." Theosophy meets 



a similar fate at the hands of the examining expert ; 
but in spite of exposures and confessions, the cults 
continue to be practised. The exposures are ex- 
plained away, new doctrines and new ' signs " are 
devised to satisfy the appetite of the curious. " With 
such men and against such a contention, argument 
is no longer even possible. Decipiantur." 

Ghosts and haunted houses, premonitions and 
clairvoyance, poltergeists and obsession, are passed 
in review ; and after a typical citation of cases and 
analysis of results, the conclusion is reached that 
the known laws of nature, the demonstrated possi- 
bilities of cleverness and conjuring, the varied pos- 
sibilities of error and prepossession, are sufficient in 
their entirety to account for the phenomena so far 
as an account may be legitimately demanded. These 
form an admirable illustration of the workings of 
the popular mind in matters occult, and they point 
a moral and adorn a tale frequently quite different 
from what the narrators of the experiences had in 
mind. 

But the crucial instances where, in the opinion of 
Mr. Podmore, as well as of other well versed and 
learned investigators, science must at present bend 
the knee and acknowledge the sovereignty of an- 
other power, are telepathy and Mrs. Piper. Tele- 
pathy, or the transference of thought from mind to 
mind by other channels than the recognized avenues 
of sensation, Mr. Podmore insists has been demon- 
strated by experiments, and receives a valuable con- 
firmation in the premonition of deaths, in dreams 
that come true, in strong verdical impressions, and 
the like. So perfectly established does the author 
regard this principle, that he uses it freely in ex- 
planation of baffling cases of other forms of psy- 
chic phenomena for which a negative conclusion 
has been reached. The impressions made by the 
chapters on telepathy upon the present reviewer are 
quite similar in logical force to those made by the 
evidence for the phenomena described in the other 
portions of the work ; the need of an ultra-scientific 
hypothesis seems as undemonstrated in the one case 
as in the other. Here is debatable land ; and from 
one who has exhibited such patience and care, as 
well as insight and experience, as has Mr. Podmore, 
it is proper to differ respectfully but none the less 
firmly. Telepathy has not as yet been returned as 
a member of the parliament of science, and, in the 
opinion of many, indeed, of most, of those whose 
opinions are entitled to carry weight, has but a 
slight and constantly decreasing prospect of occupy- 
ing the desired seat. 

As for Mrs. Piper, she is simply a mystery ; her 
specialty is to reveal in trance condition a knowl- 
edge of the sitter's private affairs astounding in its 
intimacy and correctness. The ignorant and the 
cultured, the lowly and the mighty, the skeptic and 
the believer, old and young, have sat at Mrs. Piper's 
feet and had the innermost recesses of their per- 
sonal biography revealed by the mysterious " Dr. 
Phinuit " who is the trance informant of Mrs. Piper. 
Her trances furnish the most important evidence

which the Society for Psychical Research has yet 
adduced for the existence of something beyond tele- 
pathy, and afford a sufficient justification, if any 
were needed, for the labors of the past fifteen years." 
Whether in due time the halo that now radiates 
from Mrs. Piper's head will fade away as a more 
powerful search-light is focussed upon it, or whether 
those who come to scoff will stay to pray, may safely 
be left for the future to determine. Enigmas have 
been solved again and again, and psychology has 
other and more important problems immediately 
before it than the illumination of the illusive mate- 
rial of " Psychic Research." Of greatest importance 
is the necessity of preserving a rational perspective, 
of not confusing Psychology with tales of ghosts 
and table-rappings, and of estimating these alleged 
supranormal phenomena as Mr. Podmore's volume 
will help one to do at their proper value both as 
regards their truth and their significance if true. 

Professor Ribot's volume, " The Psychology of 
the Emotions," takes us into quite a different sphere 
of mind-lore, the region not of the intellect but of 
the feelings. Here experiment must give way to 
observation and analysis, and in place of quantitative 
determinations there are variable and illusive quali- 
tative changes. Different -as is the material and 
treatment, the psychology of the emotions quite 
clearly reflects the influence of modern conceptions 
and investigations. Professor Ribot's reputation is 
that of an eminently successful expositor ; though 
not himself an experimentalist he encourages experi- 
mental work in others, and appreciates fully the 
importance of all the various trends of modern psy- 
chological activity. He brings to his writings a wise 
enthusiasm, a clear critical judgment, and an unusual 
originality of composition and generalization. Of 
all his monographs this certainly represents the work 
of greatest complexity and difficulty ; in successful 
achievement, in originality of treatment, and in 
general utility, it equals, and indeed surpasses, the 
standard of his previous contributions. It may be 
recommended as one of the most attractive and 
profitable means of approach to an interesting and 
important group of psychological problems. 

The work falls into two divisions, the first dealing 
with the general psychology of emotion, the second 
with the special psychology of the emotions. One of 
the main problems of the first division is the deter- 
mination of the nature of feeling. Is it a primitive 
fact, sui generis, coordinate with the simplest ele- 
ments of the intellectual group, sensation and per- 
ception ? or is it a mere accompaniment of the latter, 
an epi-phenomenon ? Are pleasure and pain merely 
supplementary conditions of sensation, or are they 
equally primordial, and independent of the intellect- 
ual content of the sensation ? Professor Ribot takes 
his stand with those who maintain the fundamental 
importance of the feelings, the " emotionalists " as 
opposed to the " intellectualists," and devotes many 
chapters to the support of this doctrine. In this 
investigation the relations of feelings to sensations, 



of feelings to the modes of their manifestation, of 
feelings to movements, of pleasure and pain, and of 
a wide range of allied factors, are fully discussed in 
the light of their origin, their development, their 
morbid manifestations, and their utilitarian function. 
Biology, anthropology, and pathology contribute 
facts to the normal psychology of the emotions and 
prevent the undue attention to the processes of the 
adult, educated, and cultured member of the genus 
homo, to which may be ascribed so many of the 
misconceptions of the older psychologists. Along 
with this richness of method and material have come 
new problems as well as new ways of looking at the 
old ones. Is the expression of the emotion essential 
to the emotion, or is it something accidental and su- 
perfluous ? Shall we say with James that we are sad 
because we weep, we are afraid because we tremble, 
and are angry because we strike or feel an inclina- 
tion to do so, or can we feel all these emotions without 
their motor accompaniment? Is pain a distinct sen- 
sation with perhaps a special nervous mechanism, 
or is it an adjunct of other forms of sensation ? What 
is the place of feeling in the development of the in- 
dividual and of the race ? What is the origin of the 
expression of the emotions ? What is the place of 
emotion in the intellectual life? These are some of 
the general problems which must be discussed as an 
integral portion of the study of emotion. Such dis- 
cussion has nothing of finality about it ; it is fre- 
quently a statement of opposite views with little 
indication of a preference for one or the other ; it is 
not infrequently a confession of ignorance or the 
discovery of gaps in our knowledge. None the less 
the discussion is profitable ; a preliminary survey is 
far better than none, and one cannot expect the 
equipment that comes from long periods of occupa- 
tion in the exploration of the darkest regions of 
psychology. 

The special emotions may be treated more defi- 
nitely. Certain types of emotional manifestation are 
primitive and fundamental; they appear in the lower 
forms of animal life and in the early months of in- 
fant experience ; they remain in the decadence of old 
age and combine with other forms of feelings and 
ideas to form the sentiments. Such instinctive emo- 
tions are those connected with self -conservation, 
fear, anger, sympathy. These give place, under con- 
ditions of increased intellectual development, to the 
social and moral feelings, to the religious, aesthetic, 
and intellectual sentiments. Recent investigation 
along the lines of animal study and child study, as 
well as a more intimate acquaintance with the 
thought-habits of primitive peoples, make it pos- 
sible to sketch the main characteristics of the sev- 
eral emotions with considerable definiteness; and 
Professor Ribot utilizes this type of information 
with great skill. In conclusion he attempts a clas- 
sification of characters, both normal and abnormal, 
a contribution to the science of ethology which John 
Stuart Mill suggested, which Bain attempted to in- 
augurate, and which has recently engaged the atten- 
tion of French psychologists. The result, however

interesting, is hardly scientific ; none the less, pro- 
gress has been made, misconceptions have been 
removed, and the importance of a true psychological 
method of classification has been recognized. 

In the modern world, with its endless opportuni- 
ties to acquire information, and the continuous ne- 
cessity to keep up with the times, there is consider- 
able danger of getting too much information and 
too little education, too much brain and too little 
heart. It is a wholesome tendency in modern psy- 
chology, and one well represented in this work of 
Professor Ribot, that along with the study of the 
processes of intellectual acquisition it emphasizes 
the importance of the emotions in the foundations 
of character. JOSEPH JASTBOW.

The remarkable series of papers in 
which Captain A. T. Mahan has 
United statet. from time to time expressed his 
views on most questions of American naval and for- 
eign policy are now issued in a handy volume of 
some 300 pages entitled " The Interest of America 
in Sea Power, Present and Future " (Little, Brown, 
and Co.). The titles are: "The United States 
Looking Outward," " Hawaii and Our Future Sea 
Power," " The Isthmus and Sea Power," " Possi- 
bilities of an Anglo- American Reunion," " Prepared- 
ness for Naval War," " Strategic Features of the 
Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico," etc. With 
these magazine papers many of our readers are 
doubtless already acquainted, and we need scarcely 
say that they are well worth reproducing in book 
form. They form the most considerable and author- 
itative literary contribution to the general discus- 
sion in question, and their influence upon current 
opinions has been such that .they are not unlikely to 
prove a potent factor in shaping the future history 
of this country. Captain Mahan is the most con- 
vinced, the most logical, and, with thinking people, 
the most influential exponent of the view that the 
time has come for the abandonment by us of the 
Washington! an policy of diplomatic isolation which 
" befitted our national infancy." It is time, he 
thinks, for us to assume our share of the " travail 
of Europe," of the "work of upholding the common 
interests of civilization." As to the particular point 
whence those interests are especially threatened, 
Captain Mahan is rather non-committal ; but he 
hints vaguely at the " teeming multitudes of central 
and northern Asia," against whom the " only bar- 
rier will be the warlike spirit of the representatives 
of civilization." We had rather thought that this 
particular bogey of a new Mongolian invasion 
(which so disturbed the prophetic soul of Mr. Pear- 
son) had been effectually laid by the disclosures as 
to the real state of China resulting from the Chino 
Japanese war ; and, indeed, it might be urged that 
it is now the chiefs of the Western and Christian 



world, and not those of the Asiatic steppes, that 
incline to the eole, of the Genghis Khan, and the 
barbarous gospel of the "mailed fist." Captain 
Mahan's fancy, however, it seems, still admits the 
possibility of future Attilas and Tamerlanes. He 
views our modern civilization (like the old Roman 
one) as " an oasis set in the midst of a desert of bar- 
barism," and ultimately dependant for its safety, 
" not upon its mere elaboration of organization, but 
upon the power of that organization to express itself 
in a menacing and efficient attitude of physical 
force, sufficient to resist the numerically overwhelm- 
ing, but inadequately organized hosts of outsiders." 
Such being the plight of modern civilization, it 
would of course be the clear duty of America to 
furnish its quota toward the common defence. This 
particular argument of Captain Mahan's in support 
of militarism seems to us to rest upon a somewhat 
vague and fanciful hypothesis ; and we are inclined 
to think that it is in its internal and domestic Goths 
and Vandals, " capitalistic " as well as " proletar- 
ian," that modern civilization finds its real and 
immediate foes. As to the expediency for this coun- 
try of maintaining at all times a reasonable degree 
of " preparedness for war," a degree proportional 
to the current general average of political conditions 
that in our case make for war, we heartily agree 
with Captain Mahan ; but we are by no means ready 
to admit the wisdom of a policy of territorial expan- 
sion or diplomatic intermeddling, tending to trans- 
form war from a comparatively remote contingency 
into a constantly impending danger. The menace 
to our form of government that lurks in such a pol- 
icy is evident. Militarism and popular institutions 
are fundamentally at odds ; and cogent arguments 
are not lacking to show that the first serious depart- 
ure from the traditions and maxims that have so 
long and so happily governed our relations with the 
outer world may still prove to be the beginning of 
the end of the old political order in this country. 
On the whole, we think our fellow countrymen will 
do well for the present to close their ears to the per- 
suasions of the sirens of annexation, and lay to 
heart Speaker Reed's recent aphorism, "Empire 
can wait" 

Miss Agnes Repplier's essays have 
. lon g been *> weU ^own that it would 

come near impertinence to give a 
naive account of them. It will be interesting to her 
many readers, however, to learn that in her latest 
volume, " Varia " (Houghton), she has shown what 
may be properly called a new method. We think 
that she now succeeds in getting more of herself 
into her essays ; and this we regard as an advan- 
tage. In her earlier work she was content to mag- 
netize a title or an idea and insert it into her library 
and draw it forth encrusted with quotations. That 
was not a bad thing to do : Emerson used to do it. 
except that he put the magnetized title into a 
commonplace book and drew it forth encrusted with 
original epigrams. Miss Repplier does not yet avoid

quotations, nor does she shun her library ; and this 
is well, for her quotations are well-made and her 
reading is wide and reputable. But, unless our 
memory deceives us, these things occupy a some- 
what different place in the economy of her essay : 
or, looking at it from another point of view, her 
essays have gained, we take it, character and struc- 
ture. Instead of fantasias on different wandering 
themes, we have in this volume a number of his- 
torical rsum6s of different elements in civilization, 
as, women of thought and action, diaries, drinking- 
songs, fiction. This kind of essay is perhaps sim- 
pler than the other, but it usually has more real 
merit, unless its author be one of the few great 
essay-writers of the world. Hence Miss Repplier, 
whose power consists in ready assimilation and a 
sound discrimination and appreciation, but yet not 
much strength of original (if not analytic) think- 
ing like Montaigne's, for instance, or Emerson's, 
Miss Repplier finds here a better instrument. In 
her previous volume we commended her sane judg- 
ment and unruffled common-sense. Both qualities 
may be seen here, and each is of great value in 
dealing with such subjects as the eternal feminine, 
novel-reading, Sunday-school stories. These essays 
are quite as agreeable to read as Miss Repplier's 
earlier work (singular it would be if, in the case of 
so devoted a student of style, it should not be so), 
but they have much more body to them. One thing 
we take exception to : we do not think Miss Rep- 
plier a good person to deal with the subject of bac- 
chanalia. We allow that she writes agreeably on 
the matter, but hardly to the real increase of good 
thinking on the topic. This, however, is a small 
matter : perhaps it may come from a purely theo- 
retic standpoint. We must add that in this volume 
Miss Repplier leaves her library and goes to Con- 
stantinople and Cairo by way of Douai and Syra- 
cuse. We do not recollect that this has occurred 
before, although Miss Repplier has several times 
looked out of her window and seen something. We 
hope the result of her present travels will not dis- 
courage her, although it would seem as if the things 
that she had experienced had been rather a source 
of annoyance to her than otherwise. 

The works of Miss Marie Corelli 
offer an excellent opportunity for the 
selection of elegant extracts, for the 
reason that those who like Miss Corelli's works are 
apt to like elegant extracts too. We have not often 
met Shakespearean students who longed for a 
" Beauties of Shakespeare." We do not think that 
the volume of selections, from Meredith, published 
some time since, was ever a delight to lovers of 
Meredith. Nor has " The Good, the True, and the 
Beautiful," we imagine, been wholly satisfactory to 
the Ruskinites. But the " Beauties of Marie Cor- 
elli," compiled by Miss Annie Mackay and published 
in England by Mr. George Red way and in this coun- 
try by Messrs. Lippincott Co., cannot be so criticised. 
We think that Corelli students will be glad to have 



Mus Corelli 
at seen in 
elegant extracts. 



the book lying on the marble-topped tables of their 
pensive citadels, and that Corelli lovers will give it 
a prominent place on the buhl Stagbres of their lux- 
urious boudoirs. It has also a further use. Those 
who have never read the works of Miss Corelli, and 
never mean to, may find here what those works are 
like, at the expense of very little time and trouble. 
Matthew Arnold thought that Wordsworth gained 
with the general reader by being presented in selec- 
tions ; and when he saw how much Wordsworth 
gained, he was tempted to make selections from 
Byron also. So with Miss Corelli ; only the Corel- 
Hans should try to read her in toto. We do not, 
however, think that Miss Corelli should be compared 
with Byron or Meredith, or even with Shakespeare. 
She would not herself invite such comparison, nor 
would this book justify it, save in the superficial 
manner that we have pursued. Miss Corelli, in our 
judgment, comes a little below Ouida in the scale of 
authors, and considerably above Miss Julia Edwards. 
Perhaps Miss Mackay will find time to provide us 
with selections from the works of those well-known 
ladies. If she do so, we recommend her to follow 
her present plan of arrangement, in which extracts 
are arranged according to the novels from which 
they are selected. Another way would be to group 
under one head let us say Art all the extracts 
bearing on Art ; and so on. But that plan, we think, 
would be dangerous. We would also suggest that 
instead of the term " Beauties " in the title, it might 
be better to say " Extracts," or perhaps " Elegant 
Extracts."

past two years we have had excellent manuals of 
the subject published by Mr. F. L. Pattee and Mr. 
Brander Matthews, and two other text-books of 
about the same compass are now before us. One of 
them, bearing the simple title " American Litera- 
ture " (Macmillan), is the work of Miss Katharine 
Lee Bates, and contains a gracefully written narra- 
tive treatment of the subject, running to upwards of 
three hundred pages, and adorned with over a score 
of portrait illustrations. Miss Bates has determined 
to be readable, at whatever cost of condensation or 
scientifically ordered array of facts, and has pro- 
duced a book which is primarily entertaining, 
although we by no means intend to imply that it is 
not also trustworthy. What we often miss, how- 
ever, in these attractive pages, is that scrupulous 
weighing of every critical epithet employed that 
should characterize a text-book for youthful stu- 
dents. Some of the judgments expressed have a 
random quality, if not an unhappy one ; and we 
come at times upon absolute futilities of phrase that 
might far better have been omitted. From the 
standpoint of historical scholarship, as illustrated by 
its echo of traditional opinion in dealing with such 
matters as the Pocahontas yarn, Cotton Mather 
and witchcraft, or Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga, the

book mast be pronounced superficial. Mr. Henry 
S. Pancoast's "Introduction to American Litera- 
ture " (Holt), the other text mentioned at the be- 
ginning of this paragraph, finds the critic prepos- 
sessed in its favor by the admirable " Introduction 
to English Literature " prepared by the author, a 
year or two ago. We gave high praise to that book 
when it appeared, and find in the volume now before 
us the same well-chosen diction, sobriety of judg- 
ment, and sense of perspective that characterized its 
predecessor. We should say that no better book 
had yet been produced for use in our secondary 
schools, and few that come anywhere near its stand- 
ard of excellence. 

Mr Gotte't f- wr ^ te tne history of English lit- 

shon hittory of erature within the compass of some 
English literature, f our hundred duodecimo pages is a 
task from which the wisest of students might shrink ; 
it has been done so many times already and fairly 
well done at that, while the style of an archangel 
could hardly make a manual of the sort good for 
continuous reading. But this is an age of serial 
compilations of knowledge, and the Procrustean 
tyranny of the series styled " Literatures of the 
World " left the editor no escape from contriving to 
have the story of English letters told to scale once 
more. The editor has undertaken the tale himself, 
and, being Mr. Edmund Gosse. has of course pro- 
duced " A Short History of Modern English Litera- 
ture " (Appleton) which is as nearly entertaining 
and readable as it is possible for any such work to 
be. He has also made his task somewhat more 
tolerable by beginning with Chaucer, thus leaving 
the " archaic section " of our literature for treat- 
ment in another volume by some other hand. He 
has endeavored, to quote his own words, " to give 
the reader, whether familiar with the books men- 
tioned or not, a feeling of the evolution of English 
literature in the primary sense of the term, the dis- 
entanglement of the skein, the slow and regular 
unwinding, down succeeding generations, of the 
threads of literary expression." The element of 
biography is almost wholly dispensed with, making 
the interest strictly critical and philosophical, and 
the work has, in comparison with its numerous rivals, 
whatever advantages may flow from original and 
epigrammatic turns of expression, quotations of the 
unhackneyed sort that show a man to be fresh from 
the reading of many of the authors discussed, and 
the general charm of manner that attaches to every- 
thing that Mr. Gosse writes. 



Celebrated 
law-trialt 
in America. 



Encouraged by the success of his 
interesting work entitled " Extraor- 
dinary Cases," which was noticed in 
our columns a twelvemonth or so ago, Mr. Henry 
Lauren Clinton now issues a second and similar 
volume, " Celebrated Trials " (Harper), containing 
sketches of other noted cases with which the author 
has been professionally connected during his forty 
years of active practice at the New York bar. Mr. 



Clinton defended, for instance, Mrs. Cunningham in 
the celebrated Cunningham-Burdell case, and Rich- 
ard Croker against the charge of murdering John 
McKenna ; and he was of counsel in the Tweed and 
the Kelly vs. Havemeyer cases. The Cunningham- 
Burdell trial occupies nearly half of the volume, and 
Mr. Clinton's account of it is as engrossing as one 
of Poe's tales. This Burdell mystery has never, we 
believe, been unravelled. Other trials recounted by 
the author are : the case of Dr. E. M. Brown, of 
Watson and Crary, of Robert J. Gamble and Ma- 
tilde Hujus, of Isaac Van Wart Buckhont, of A. 
Oakey Hall (tried for neglect of official duty), of 
Favre vs. Monvoisin, etc. The book is brimful of 
striking and sensational incidents, of examples of 
ingenious shifts of legal practice, of searching judi- 
cial analysis, and of impassioned flights of forensic 
eloquence. The author's style is manly and direct, 
and he sensibly refrains from gilding his narrative 
with the rhetorical flourishes which he evidently 
finds it advantageous to use in addressing a jury. 
Mr. Clinton's second volume is, like his first, one 
that members of the bar should greatly relish ; while 
to the lay reader with a taste for romantic fiction 
it offers the allurements of o'er-true tales steeped in 
the atmosphere of mystery and crime. The book is 
well made, and it contains several portraits of lead- 
ing legal lights, including one of the author. 

Actuated by a common friendship 
for Thomas Carlyle and a certain 
kinship between their own natures, 
John Sterling and Ralph Waldo Emerson exchanged 
letters at more or less frequent intervals during the 
latter part of Sterling's life. Though never meet- 
ing face to face, each found in the other a stimulus 
and an attraction which makes the volume of their 
correspondence now published (Honghton) well 
worth the reading. The editor, Mr. Edward Waldo 
Emerson, has done his modest work well, prefacing 
the letters with a brief sketch of the delicate and 
short-lived man to whom Emerson wrote, "Thou- 
sands of hearts have owed to you the finest mystic 
influences," and of whom Carlyle said, " He was a 
brilliant, human presence, honourable and lovable 
amid the dim, common populations." The book is 
a small one, less than a hundred pages, yet it gives 
us pleasant glimpses of both men, the one whose 
name and thought has permeated all literature, and 
the one whose gifts promised so much and yet who 
was permitted to accomplish so little. 

Krtiger's "History of Early Chris- 
tian Literature" (Macmillan) is a 
compound of biographical and biblio- 
graphical material. It covers not only the authors 
and works of three centuries, but the later literature 
which has grown up around them. The books of 
the New Testament, as well as the apocryphal lit- 
erature, are claimants for a place in this thick vol- 
ume of over 400 pages. There is a feeling of satis- 
faction, as one takes up this book, that he has in

hand a fairly exhaustive European bibliography of 
every important author and work included within 
its compass. The apostles and church fathers of 
three continents, of all shades of Christian belief, of 
variant degrees of scholarship, have their niche in 
this literary edifice. It is gratifying to find so many 
valuable personal facts about the great churchmen 
of that age. In the same section are cited the orig- 
inal works of each ancient author, in its different 
editions, and in immediate connection the later 
works which have been built on those originals. 
We should have highly prized a word now and then 
by the distinguished author on the special value of 
some of the literature referred to. Enough, how- 
ever, is cited on each subject, he says, " for a thor- 
ough study of that subject." At the end of the book 
is a valuable chronological conspectus, which por- 
trays the gradual progress of literary productivity 
in the several provinces of the Empire. This, with 
a full round index of authors and works, gives 
the volume such a bibliographical completeness, 
except as to American works, as will be a delight 
and a treasure to every scholar who delves into 
this important period of the growth and spread of 
Christianity. 

The American student desirous of 
becoming acquainted with the lan- 
guage of Norway and Denmark has 
hitherto been unable to secure the help of a suitable 
grammatical manual. None of the books hitherto 
published in this country has been altogether ade- 
quate to the needs of the student, and there was a 
real demand for such a work as Prof. Julius E. 
Olson's " Norwegian Grammar and Reader " (Scott, 
Foresman, & Co.), which has just been published. 
We are glad to note that the author carries the 
courage of his convictions far enough to style his 
book a " Norwegian " grammar, in defiance of the 
pedantry which would insist upon the term " Dano- 
Norwegian," and of the impossible contention that 
such writers as Herr Bj&rnson and Dr. Ibsen do not 
use the Norwegian language. Rather less than half 
of the work is devoted to the grammar ; the rest 
consists of well-chosen selections, with notes and a 
vocabulary. The extracts range all the way from 
Eventyr by AsbjOrnsen and Moe to examples chosen 
from the Dioscuri of contemporary Norwegian lit- 
erature and lyrics from the Maalstrcever. They 
make up a singularly attractive collection, and the 
student who masters them all will have made a good 
start in his acquaintance with the Norwegian lan- 
guage, literature, and history. It is a task well worth 
undertaking for anyone who knows German to begin 
with, since it offers an unusually great reward for 
an unusually small amount of effort.

already had more than one occasion to commend. 
Catherine Schuyler, wife of General Philip Schuyler, 
was a daughter of Colonel John Van Rensselaer, 
son of Hendrick and grandson of Killian, the first 
Patroon, whose estate was at Claverack, about forty 
miles from Albany, and a few miles back from the 
present town of Hudson. Thus by virtue of blood 
and marriage, at least, Mrs. Schuyler was, although 
personally of a retiring and domestic turn, a repre- 
sentative figure among the matrons of the Revolu- 
tion. Her life embraced a momentous and stirring 
period in our national history, including, in its mil- 
itary aspect, the French, and Indian, and Revolu- 
tionary Wars, and, in its political, the transitional 
colonial period and the beginnings of the Nation. 
To the student of manners, the story of Mrs. Schuy- 
ler's life is instructive, and the author tells it simply 
and literally. It abounds in vivacious pictures and 
incidents illustrative of the social and domestic life 
of the time, and affords a glimpse or two of Dutch 
colonial life at Albany. There is a well executed 
portrait of Mrs. Schuyler. 

The publication of the personal let- 
rant. * ers p f prominent men results often 
in disappointing those who believe 
the verdict of history will be materially changed 
thereby. Sources are now so available and so uni- 
versally used that the fruits of the letters remaining 
unused are little more than the pleasure derived 
from a knowledge of the friendships of great men. 
The Hon. Elihu B. Washburne was for many years 
so close a friend of General Grant that the publica- 
tion of Grant's "Letters to a Friend" (Crowell) 
gives pleasant glimpses of the friendship between 
the two, but adds little of historic value. The most 
interesting letter is the one in which Grant refuses 
to listen to the suggestion that he should declare 
himself not a candidate for the Presidency in 1880 
under any circumstances. Gen. James Grant Wilson 
contributes an introduction to the attractively pub- 
lished little volume. 



Volume V. in the pretty " Arcady 
Library " series is entitled "The 
Happy Exile " (John Lane), and con- 
tains some twenty-two pleasantly fancied rustic 
sketches, the fruit of the sentimental holiday ram- 
bles of a young Londoner among the green lanes 
and by-paths of Cornwall. Mr. H. D. Lowry is the 
editor, and Mr. E. Philip Pimlott has furnished a 
half-dozen acceptable etchings. Most of the papers 
have appeared in English periodicals, but they de- 
serve their present setting. The writer makes no 
pretence of being an observer of the Thoreau- 
Jefferies order, but he evidently has the jaded 
" cit's " keen delight in the things of the country, 
and his raptures are unfeigned. There is a mild 
vein of adolescent sentimentality throughout, and 
the Cornish types are not ill-drawn. The volume 
will form a delightful companion for a vacation 
ramble.

As the volumes on the " Ten Epochs 
n e Age of the of Church History " (Christian Lit- 

Renascence. . J ^ . 

erature Co.) appear, one by one, it 
is discovered that not all of them are, in fact, church 
histories. This may be said of the seventh volume, 
in which Mr. Paul Van Dyke tells the story of " The 
Age of the Renascence," aided by an Introduction 
furnished by his brother, the Rev. Henry Van Dyke. 
" An outline sketch of the History of the Papacy 
from the return from Avignon to the Sack of 
Rome ( 1377-1527 ) " can only be regarded as 
Church history upon the theory that the Church and 
the Papacy were identical at that time ; and as the 
book is written from an ultra- Protestant standpoint, 
it holds no such theory. And as a history of the 
Renascence, it is disappointing in so far as it passes 
over the artistic revival which was such an impor- 
tant feature of the Renascence, and barely touches 
the development of university life. These omissions 
are apologized for in the Introduction. Still, what 
is told us of the Humanists is well told ; the book 
is readable, and it will no doubt be found to fur- 
nish an admirable preparation for the volume on 
the Age of the Reformation, which is to follow. It 
is, however, regrettable that the author should so 
often descend from the dignified style in which seri- 
ous history should be written, and use such modern 
terms in writing of events in the Middle Ages, as 
the " middle-of-the-road policy," " Judge Lynch," 
" Kentucky feuds," etc.

Constitution*. contains some valuable work. It is 
written, to some extent, with the marvellously infe- 
licitous exuberance of rhetoric so familiar in the 
author's " History of the United States." But with 
all that, the facts are gathered with care and grouped 
with judgment. Part I. treats of " Early Charters 
and Constitutions," Part II. of "The Federal 
Union," and Part III. of " State Constitutions since 
1789." Especially valuable are Chapter IV. in 
Part I., dealing with " Early State Constitutions " 
(1776-1789), and the whole of Part III. Too 
little study has been given to the Constitutions of 
the States, and one of the wholesome signs of an 
awakened political consciousness is the fact that such 
studies are beginning to appear. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Volume V. of the " Studies and Notes in Philology 
and Literature," issued by Harvard University, through 
the publishing house of Messrs. Ginn & Co., is a " Child 
Memorial Volume." It was already planned as a greet- 
ing to the late Professor Child, in celebration of his 
fiftieth year of teaching in the University, completed in 
June, 1896, but his death in the following September 
changed the greeting into a memorial. Following the 
Latin dedication (left unchanged) of Professor Green- 
ough, there are no less than sixteen papers, mostly con- 



cerned with the minuter part of scholarship, but given 
a distinct literary flavor by the inclusion of such contri- 
butions as " The Text of Donne's Poems," by Professor 
C. E. Norton ; " The Influence of Emerson," by Pro- 
fessor A. S. Hill ; " The Ballad and Communal Poetry," 
by Professor F. B. Gummere ; " Who Was Sir Thomas 
Malory ? " by Professor G. L. Kittredge ; and " The 
German Hamlet and the Earlier English Versions," by 
Mr. John Corbin. 

We have received from the Hamburg publishing 
house of Herr Leopold Voss, two works of much value 
to the student of dramatic literature and art. One of 
them is a " Beschreibung des Geistlichen Schauspiels 
im Deutschen Mittelalter " by Herr Richard Heinzel. 
It is a volume of over three hundred and fifty pages, 
crammed with erudition, and as unreadable as a produc- 
tion of German scholarship can contrive to be, which 
fact does not prevent it from being a work of much learn- 
ing, and a contribution of great importance to the liter- 
ature of its subject. The other publication to which 
reference is made is a study of " Der Dramatische 
Monolog in der Foetik des 17. and 18. Jahrhunderts 
und in den Dramen Lessings," by Herr Friedrich Diisel. 
It is a brochure of about eighty pages, possessing rather 
an sesthetical than a historical interest. 

The master historian of England under the Stuarts, 
Mr. Samuel Rawson Gardiner, has published a volume 
of two hundred pages entitled " What Gunpowder Plot 
Was " (Longmans). The book, he tells us, grew out of 
a conviction that the late work of Father Gerard upon 
the same subject had not removed all the difficulties. 
The latter attempted to break down the truth of the 
traditional story by testing it with the evidence. In this 
he not only urged that many of the government's declara- 
tions were inconsistent with the evidence and pointed 
to falsification, but went beyond that to argue that part 
of the evidence was inconsistent with physical facts. 
His eminent services are admitted by Mr. Gardiner, 
but after his own exhaustive investigation Mr. Gar- 
diner's conclusion is mainly in favor of the traditional 
story. 

"Not to furnish booksellers and bookbuyers with an 
exhaustive catalogue of books, but to make the material 
which is most useful for the study of municipal history 
more accessible to historical students," is the avowed 
intention of Professor Charles Gross, of Harvard Uni- 
versity, in his " Bibliography of British Municipal His- 
tory." The 432 pages needed for this purpose show 
the vast extent of the material thus noted for the stu- 
dent in this important field of local institutions. The 
volume is number five in the " Harvard Historical 
Studies " (Longmans). 

Mr. Thomas Benfield Harbottle is the compiler of a 
" Dictionary of Quotations (Classical)," just published 
by the Macmillan Co., and designed to accompany the 
previously issued dictionary of English quotations pre- 
pared by Colonel P. H. Dalbiac and a forthcoming 
volume of quotations from modern Continental writers. 
The Latin and Greek sections of the present work are 
distinct, and each quotation is coupled with an English 
translation, literary rather than literal, the works of 
the standard translators being annexed in the majority 
of cases. There are three subject-indexes, in Latin, 
Greek, and English, respectively, which might have 
been made fuller than we find them, but which pro- 
vide a fairly adequate key to the contents of this use- 
ful volume.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

~~ London, Feb. IS, 1898. 

Each season brings its own fashion; and whether it 
be in hats or blouses, collars or jackets, pictures or books, 
it serves to interest a blase society, if only for the few 
months when London is having what is called its 
" season." The art of the sartor has its own special 
critics, and, no doubt, these are able to wax eloquent 
and enthusiastic enough, without the aid of their 
brethren of the stage or of literature. The art of the 
painter or the writer is always sure of exponents and 
even of satirists. Indeed, so numerous are they grow- 
ing, these writers on writers, that we are threatened 
with a new plague. A perfect host of critics is swarm- 
ing the corridors of the offices of Fleet Street and New 
Grub Street. 

The latest fashion, in which one dare not now be igno- 
rant, is Omar Khayyam. I have already told you of 
the new translations which are in preparation; but it 
would astonish you not a little were you aware of the 
many that are being laid down, in the breasts of the 
aspiring scribblers, who, without even a rudimentary 
knowledge of the Persian alphabet, yet hope to achieve 
immortality by a sublimation of the essence of what has 
already been accomplished by such scholars as Fitz- 
Gerald, McCarthy, Heron Allen, Nicolas, and Boden- 

stedt. Our Omar Khayyam Club is on the war-path, 

what it intends to accomplish, only its members know. 
What it will accomplish, it would not be very difficult 
to prophecy. Well may a wearied bookseller exclaim 
" There was an old person of Ham 
Who wearied of Omar Khayyam. 
' FitzGerald,' said he, 
' Is as right as can be ; 

But this Club, and these " versions " O dam I ' " 
Then, further, it is " the thing " to be wise and look 
silent eloquence about George Meredith. The Mere- 
dithian cult has passed through the gestative period, and 
it is now nibbling at the egg-shell, previous to stalking 
abroad in all the nakedness of a brave gosling. The 
brotherhood of the pen have hailed him, on his seven- 
tieth birthday, with a gorgeous illuminated address, to 
be followed soon by the regulation " Society," founded 
for the purpose of studying the scintillating corusca- 
tions of his epigrams, to see wherein lies the wit, and to 
publish volumes of researches in the shape of " transac- 
tions." Paradoxes are gone with the snows of yester- 
year, epigrams are in, and green with the green of 
youth. Lately, one might admire the Shakespearian 
brow; now, we must swear by the beard of Meredith. 
Ah, yes! that Shakespearian brow is elegant. It reminds 
me of a little tale, which I believe to be true as well as 
ben trovato. You are, of course, aware that this special 
brow is not extinct it is in our midst to-day. Well, 
the story goes that a leading novelist met an equally 
leading poet at a party, and, apparently, the two " got 
on " very well. Some time after, a friend asked the 
" leading " novelist what he thought of the " leading " 
poet. "Oh," was the reply, "a charming man, and a 
very gifted writer. Yet to the eye he did not impress 
one as I had expected. He lacked the great brow of a 
Shakespeare." The friend looked at the "leading" 
novelist, and smiled. 

We are all in a muddle. First, the author swears he 
is going to turn publisher; then, the bookseller threatens 
to boycott the author; then, the publisher threatens to 
damn both ; and now, the author, publisher, and book- 
seller are hopelessly mixed up. Mr. Buchanan sells his 



own wares; Mr. Heinemann writes his own plays; and 
a publisher announces that not only will he sell his own 
books, but he will open shops all over London, and sell 
everybody's books. Not that anything matters much 
now-a-days; but I have no doubt the publisher-bookseller 
will manage to do better than either the author-publisher, 
or the publisher-author, or the bookseller-publisher. 
When one is a successful author, like Mr. Buchanan, 
one may take to amateur publishing by way of amuse- 
ment. When one is a successful publisher, like Mr. 
Heinemann, one may indulge in the gentle art of mak- 
ing plays, just to show the world that there is more in a 
publisher than meets the unsophisticated observer. But 
why should it be necessary for the successful publisher 
to become a competitor with poor and unsuccessful 
booksellers ? 

It is almost impossible to send you news of new pub- 
lications, now that " Literature " has remodelled its 
" Notes " columns. For in those columns you will read, 
not of what publishers are actually doing that's a very 
small affair but of what authors are going to do, or 
are just engaged in doing, or are hoping or expecting 
to do. The plan is very simple : the editor of the 
" Notes " section is in personal communication with au- 
thors, from whom he obtains the necessary information, 
which, with a little deft pruning, is made ready for the 
press, and there you are. It does not always follow 
that what authors are doing or are hoping to do will see 
publication day; but that is a matter for settlement be- 
tween other parties. In the meantime, I had better tell 
you at once, or the author will let it out before me, that 
there is to be a new guide to London. When I say 
" new," I mean it. Absolutely, it will have no rival, 
and the curious part about it will be that Londoners 
themselves will buy it eagerly. Also, we are to have a 
great book on mezzotint engraving, fully illustrated, 
with all sorts of " tips " for the collector. Also, a big 
work on the history of the modern stage in England, 
with quite a crowd of portraits and illustrations. Then 
will come a new and prettily-printed series of books, 
including all the best classics of all literatures, in uni- 
form size, fit for carrying in the waistcoat pocket, and 
as elegantly bound as are the most respectable of 
prayer-books. 

I hear of a new novel which Mr. William O'Brien, 
late a member of the Irish Nationalist party, has just 
completed. It deals with Western Ireland, and has a 
picturesque amazonian character of Elizabeth's day. 

The "Edinburgh" edition of the books of Robert 
Louis Stevenson is to have yet another volume. In re- 
sponse to a widely expressed desire, so runs the infor- 
mation, it has been decided, at a conference held last 
week, to include the " Juvenilia." These will consist 
of Stevenson's early and curious ventures in literature. 
In particular may be mentioned a poem illustrating two 
plates, and the long lost introduction to " The Master 
of Ballantrae." The volume is intended to be a surprise 
to subscribers, so that further particulars are not forth- 
coming. In a few weeks, however, these will have had 
the volume delivered, and, no doubt, they are now 
eagerly waiting for it. 

Mr. Unwin has started his " Library of Literary His- 
tory." It is on quite different lines to the two similarly 
named series issued here by Mr. Heinemann and Messrs. 
Blackwood ; but it is only fair to Mr. Unwin to say that 
his series had been planned and the volumes laid down 
long before the rival publications were announced. It 
deserves success. TEMPL

LITERARY NOTES. 

"The Bible Story Retold for Young People," by 
Messrs. W. H. Bennett and W. F. Adeney, is a recent 
publication of the Macmillan Co. 

" The Wage Earner," being Daudet's " Soutien de 
Famille " in English, is promised for early publication 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

" From September to June with Nature," by Miss 
Minetta L. Warren, is a primary reading-book just pub- 
lished by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

" Crusoe's Island, A Bird-Hunter's Story," by Mr. 
Frederick A. Ober, has just been added to their " Home 
Reading Books " by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

Two new volumes have appeared in the Scribner edi- 
tion of Mr. J. W. Riley's writings. They are entitled 
" Afterwhiles " and " Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury." 

The Autobiography of Charles H. Spurgeon, compiled 
from his diary, records, and letters, by his wife and his 
private secretary, is announced by the Fleming H. 
Revell Co. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish a " Fifth Reader " and a 
" Sixth Reader " in their " Educational Music Course," 
edited by Messrs. L. W. Mason, J. M. McLaughlin, 
G. A. Veazie, and W. W. Gilchrist. 

An interesting account of the wonderful Ware collec- 
tion of Blaschka glass flowers in the Harvard Univer- 
sity Museum, written by Mr. Franklin B. Wiley, has just 
been published by Mr. Bradlee Whidden. 

A text of the " Tablet of Cebes," which offers the 
schoolboy about the easiest Greek he is likely to find, 
has just been edited for educational use by Mr. C. S. 
Jerram, and published by the Oxford University Press. 

Part I. of Shakespeare's " King Henry IV.," edited 
by Mr. William Aldis Wright, has just been published 
by the Oxford University Press. From the same source 
we have received " Geometry for Beginners," a very 
elementary text-book by Mr. George M. Minchin. 

Still another series of histories of literature is an- 
nounced. Mr. T. Fisher Unwin, who planned the " Story 
of the Nations " series, will publish the " Library of 
Literary History," to be made up of volumes upon lines 
similar to those of the earlier series. " The Literary 
History of India," by Mr. R. W. Frazer, will be the 
first volume to appear. 

With the March number the well-known English 
" Pall Mall Magazine " begins the publication of an 
American edition, under the management of Mr. A. E. 
Keet, formerly editor of " The Forum." The contents 
and illustration of this magazine are of a high character, 
and it promises to become a formidable rival to our own 
magazines of the first class. 

The Burton Society, recently organized in Denver, 
proposes to publish, for the benefit of subscribers only, 
a reprint of Burton's "Arabian Nights," copied after the 
Benares edition of 1885-88. The sixteen volumes of 
this work will cost the first hundred subscribers ninety 
dollars each, after which the subscription price will be 
raised to one hundred dollars. 

A " double section " of the " Xew English Diction- 
ary," extending from Frank-law to Gain-coming, 
edited by Mr. Henry Bradley, has just made its appear- 
ance from the Oxford Press. This carries Volume IV. 
(F. G.) a long step nearer completion. The letter F, 
now done with, contains 13,607 words of all sorts, 
besides 3,459 " obvious combinations." 



Mr. Richard LeGallienne's tame and superfluous 
paraphrase from the English translators of Omar Khay- 
yam is published by Mr. John Lane in a volume of such 
charming workmanship as to soften in some degree the 
feeling of resentment naturally occasioned by Mr. Le- 
Gallienne's impudent performance. It makes a pretty 
book, however insignificant as literature. 

A book-club has recently been organized in Gonver- 
neur, New York, under the title of " Brothers of the 
Book." As an outlet to their enthusiasm they are issu- 
ing, in pretty brochure form, that summing up of Pater's 
philosophy to be found in the " Conclusion " of " The 
Renaissance." The Scrivener, Mr. L. C. Woodworth, 
will be glad to furnish book-lovers with further partic- 
ulars regarding the publication. 

The " Science Series," announced by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons, will discuss, in a series of independent 
monographs, the more important aspects of contempo- 
rary scientific knowledge. " The Stars," by Professor 
Newcomb ; "Earth Structure," by Professor Geikie ; 
" General Ethnography," by Professor Brinton, and " The 
History of Science," by Mr. C. S. Pierce, are a few of 
the score of books already arranged for and announced. 

The managers of the Chicago City Press Association 
have compiled an invaluable little " Reporter's Note- 
Book," the object of which is " to call attention to those 
errors most frequently found in reportorial copy." 
While the work is therefore primarily addressed to the 
newspaper reporter, its concisely- written chapters could 
be read with profit by anyone who writes for publica- 
tion. The book is published by Mr. C. A. Whitney, 
La Grange, 111. 

That Cabeza de Vaca, in his long wanderings from 
somewhere on the coast of Texas to very near the Cal- 
ifornian Gulf, touched New Mexico in 1536, was be- 
lieved only so long as investigation of the matter was 
unscientific. Mr. Bandelier, who has no near rival in 
critical knowledge of the documentary " sources," the 
ethnography, and the physical geography involved, years 
ago established the general itinerary of the long-suffering 
Spaniard, and proved definitively that he never saw any 
portion of what is now New Mexico. Two students of 
the University of Texas (Miss Brownie Ponton and Mr. 
B. H. McFarland) attempt, in the January " Quarterly " 
of the State Historical Association, to establish a more 
northerly route. There is a certain plausibility in some 
of their surmises as to unimportant parts of the march 
in Texas; but the crux of the matter is merely "Did 
Vaca touch New Mexico ? " Without personal knowl- 
edge of the Territory, and with scant erudition in its eth- 
nology and its Spanish chronicles, they satisfy them- 
selves that he did; but the theory is untenable to more 
critical investigators. For the determination of a ques- 
tion which is one of the most recondite in early Amer- 
ican history, there needs years of documentary training, 
of dangerous and difficult exploration, and of ethno- 
graphic field-knowledge, all temporally impossible to 
any college undergraduate. 

Mr. W. G. Collingwood has recently printed the fol- 
lowing interesting item : " I am glad to say that Mr. 
Ruskin's health is much as it has been during these later 
years. He still takes his daily walks, sees his personal 
friends, and spends much time in reading. But it does 
not seem to be understood by the public that his com- 
parative health depends upon his being kept from all 
unnecessary work. He directs his own business, but is 
obliged to decline correspondence, and cannot reply to

the many letters which still come asking for his inter- 
vention in public matters, or for private advice and 
assistance." Canon Rawnsley, who never misses an op- 
portunity to pen a sonnet of the anniversary or memorial 
sort, has just published the following tribute to Mr. 
Kuskin, upon the occasion of the seventy-ninth birthday 
of the great art-critic and ethical teacher. 

" Born in our monster Babylon, to decree 

The blasting of all Babylons and ordained 
To be her avant-conrier who has reigned 
Longest and best we give God thanks for thee. 

Tho' conquering hosts encompass land and sea, 
And men of arms her Empire have maintained, 
Thou art her mightiest warrior, thou hast gained 

By power of wisdom wider sovereignty. 

Wherefore to thee, for whom this day has brought 
The golden crown thy eightieth year shall wear, 
We bring the tribute of our love and praise, 
And borne from far-off centuries we hear 

Proud acclamation of the seer who wrought 
Undying splendour for Victorian days."

HOW TO SEE THE POINT AND PLACE IT: 

Punctuation Without Rules of Grammar. 

A book of forty pages which teaches punctuation rapidly by example. 
Many people who have studied English, Latin, and Greek grammar are 
very careless and slovenly punctuators. This book is indispensable to 
all writers. Memorising rules and exceptions wastes time and they are 
soon forgotten. Also gives rules for placing capital letters and italics, 
and preparing manuscripts for publication. By mail, 20 cts. ; cloth, 40 cts. 

LACONIC PUBLISHING CO., 123 Liberty St., New York. 

THE MASTERY OF MEMORIZING. 

GREATEST MEN IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY have had 
remarkable memories. A slight investigation will show that the 
most successful business men are possessed of wonderful memories. 
The training of the memory should be the basis of education. The 
demands of commercial life are daily becoming more onerous : more 
details must be mastered, more facts and figures remembered. Only 
the possessor of a powerful memory can win and hold a chief position 
in the world of work. Price, $1.00. Postpaid on receipt of price.

SCRIBNERS' NEWEST BOOKS 



Heady April 2 : 

THE GIRL AT COBHURST. By Frank R. Stockton. 

12mo. Price, $1.50. 

An entirely new love-story by Mr. Stockton which has not appeared serially. The scene is laid in a country 
Tillage, and the chief humorous characters are a French cook (widow of an " artist ") and a match-making old 
maid, whose simultaneous endeavors to lead the hero's affections in opposite paths supply some truly Stocktonian 
intricacies of plot. 

SOME OF MB. STOCKTON'S RECENT SUCCESSES. 
A Story -Teller's Pack. Illustrated, 12mo, $1.50. Rudder Grange and Pomona's Travels. 

" In this latest book of his there is not one disappoint- New and Cheaper Edition. Each, illustrated, 12mo, 
ment." WILLIAM DBAS HOWKLLS. $1.50. 

The Adventures of Captain Horn. 12mo, 81.50. Mrs. Cliff's Yacht. Illustrated, 12mo, $1.50. 

The London Speaker has said of these two volumes : " Mr. Stockton has touched the high-water mark of romantic 
fiction and has shown his power to grasp the magic of Defoe and Stevenson." 



NAPOLEON HI. AND HIS COURT. 

By IMBERT DE ST. AMAKD. With portraits. 12mo, $1.50. 

A new volume in a series devoted to the Second French Empire. The 
period covered is from Eugenie's elevation to the rank of Empress, in 
1863, to the birth of the Prince Imperial, in 1856, and the Crimean War 
and the Great Exposition of 1855 figure prominently in the author's 
fluent account, which gains much in vividness from the fact that he is 
personally familiar with all the happenings of these years. 

Already Publithed: Louis Napoleon and Mademoiselle de 
Monti jo. With portraits. 12mo, SI. 50. 

YOUNG BLOOD. 

By E. W. HOBNUNG, author of " My Lord Duke," " The 

Rogue's March," etc. 12mo, $1.25. 

This is another of the "good stories" which have endeared the 
author to the fiction-reading public. The mystery dominating the 
whole plot and unexplained till the very end, the plucky hero and his 
remarkable adventures while getting his start in literature, the inim- 
itable " promoter " of gigantic stock companies, the brutal school- 
teacher with a genius for mathematics and an " infallible " gambling 
system all these are hi Mr. Hornung'a best vein. 

NOVELS AND STORIES BY Q." 

(A. T. QUILLBB-COUCH.) 9 vols., each 12mo, $1.25. 

This is the first uniform edition of the works of Mr. Quiller-Couch,

foremost of modern short-story writers." The volumes will be : The 
Splendid Spur, The Blue Pavilion, Wandering Heath, Troy 
Town, Delectable Duchy, Dead Man's Rock, Noughts and 
Crosses, Three Ships, and Adventures in Criticism. 

EMERSON, AND OTHER ESSAYS. 

By JOHN JAY CHAPMAN. 12mo, $1.25. 

With his paper on Emerson, which attracted such widespread atten- 
tion as a magazine article by its independence and originality, the 
author has here grouped critical analyses of Whitman, Browning, 
Stevenson, the character of Romeo, and Michael Angelo's sonnets. 



AULD LANG SYNE.

" The Science of Language," etc. Crown 8vo, $2.00.

fame, some lively, gome sentimental and all delightfully entertain- 
ing." If etc York Herald. 

FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY. 

A Story of Land and Sea in the Days of the Revolution. By 
CYKPB TOWNSKND BRADY, Archdeacon of Pennsylvania. 
12mo, $1.25. 

" The sea-fights are portrayed with a graphic power well-nigh un- 
exampled in American fiction, and the new view of Washington in the 
Trenton and Princeton campaign give* the book historickl import- 
ance." Army and Navy Journal. 

MUSIC. 

How it Came to Be What It Is. By HANNAH SMITH. With 

many illustrations. 12mo, $1.25 net. 

A clear and concise account of the development of modern music 
and the principal instruments, with many illustrations which assist

interestingly. 

WHAT IS GOOD MUSIC? 

Suggestions to Persons Desiring to Cultivate a Taste in 
Musical Art. By W. J. HBXDEBSON. 12mo, $1.00 net. 
" It is to lovers of music who are ignorant of technical matters that 
Mr. Henderson has written his book, and they will be grateful to him 
for the clearness of the exposition, the fulness of thought, and the 
authority born of knowledge and experience. Recently there have 
been several books treating on the same subject, but that of Mr. Hen- 
derson stands easily first." Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.'

Caleb West, Master Diver. 

By F. HOPKINSON SMITH, author of " Tom Grogan," 
" Gondola Days," etc. Finely illustrated, 12mo, $1.50. 
[Early in April.~] 

Caleb West is a phenomenal master diver in the build- 
ing of a lighthouse, and a very interesting character. 
A bluff and invincible sea captain figures effectively and 
picturesquely. The " ever-womanly " element is by no 
means lacking; and the story, like "Tom Grogan," is 
profoundly alive, thoroughly interesting, and uncom- 
monly well illustrated. 

Penelopes Progress. 

By KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN, author of "The Birds' 
Christmas Carol," " The Story of Patsy," "A Cathe- 
dral Courtship," " Marm Lisa," etc. IGmo, in unique 
Scottish binding, $1.25. [7n April.] 
This is a continuation of Mrs. Wiggin's sensible, hu- 
morous, delightful story of " Penelope's Experiences in 
England." Penelope and her fellow-tourists, Salemina 
and Francesca, invade first Edinburgh and then the out- 
lying districts, and they take the country and the Scots 
by storm, an indescribable mingling of good sense, 
canniness, audacity, and fun. A most readable book.

Remus " and " Thimblefinger " stories. With illus- 
trations, crown 8vo, $1.50. [Early in April.'] 
A book of stories of interesting adventures and char- 
acter studies of the South, most of them during the war

stories so agreeable and fascinating. 

The Imported Bridegroom, 

<And Other Stories of the New York Ghetto. 

By ABRAHAM CAHAN, author of " Yekl." IGmo, cloth, 
$1.00; Riverside Paper Series, 50 cents. 
These stories take the reader into a field almost en- 
tirely nnworked as a literary possibility. They relate 
to Russian Jews in New York City, of whom many have 
heard, but few know anything definite. The author is 
familiarly acquainted with them, their antecedents, their 
condition when they reach this country, their modes of 
life afterward, their views of religion and of life; and 
his book is one of uncommon interest. 

From the Other Side. 

Stories of Transatlantic Travel. By HENRY B. FULLER, 
author of " The Cliff-Dwellers," " The Chevalier of 
Pensieri-Vani," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
Four charming stories of Italy and England. Not 

only are they good stories, but Mr. Fuller's literary art 

lends to them a peculiar attraction. 



Cheerful Yesterdays. 

By THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON. 12 mo, $2.00. 
This book is the very flower of autobiography. It 
gives in the most attractive manner the most interest- 
ing experiences of a singularly interesting life. It de- 
scribes Colonel Higginson's boyhood in Cambridge, his 
years and associates in Harvard College, the observa- 
tions and experiences which made him a reformer, the 
development of literature and his own literary work in 
the fifties, the stirring episode of the Kansas conflicts, 
and a very modest account of his share in the Civil War. 
The intrinsic and varied interest of the book, its noble 
and cheerful tone, and its exquisite literary style give 
it an uncommon charm and value. 

Unforeseen Tendencies in 
Democracy. 

By EDWIN L. GODKIN, Editor of the New York Nation. 

1 vol., crown 8vo. [In April,'] 

A book of remarkable value, that should be read and 
deeply pondered *by all good citizens. In it the aspects 
of American political life are stated with explicit frank- 
ness but without exaggeration, and current facts, opin- 
ions, and tendencies are compared or contrasted with 
the theories held concerning democratic government by 
the Fathers of the Republic.

" Mr. Stanley Weyman has written a rattling good romantic 
story that is in every way worthy of the author of the ever- 
delightful 'Gentleman of France.' "New York Sun. 

" ' Shrewsbury ' is a magnificent confirmation of Mr. Wey- 
man's high estate in the world of fiction. His characters are 
alive, human, nnforgetable. His scenes are unhackneyed, 
dramatic, powerful. The action is sustained and consistent, 
sweeping one's interest along irresistibly to a denouement at 
once logical and climactic. And through it all there glows that 
literary charm which makes his stories live even as those of

of the Rothiemurchus Grants. It was from this particular 
branch of the ancient Scottish family that General Grant 
claimed descent. Miss Grant's reminiscences of the period of

The Founding of the German Empire by William I. 

By HEDTRICH vos STBKL, translated by Helena Schimmelfennig White. Vol. VII., completing the set. 8vo, cloth, gilt top, $2. 
The seventh and concluding volume of this monumental work, which the author, before his death, succeeded in bringing to a successful cul- 
mination in spite of the jealous and petty restrictions on the part of the government, brings the story down to the Franco-Prussian war. This is 
naturally the most dramatic and fascinating of all the volumes, and throws a flood of light on the whole history of Europe during those momentous 
years, 1SC8, 1869, and 1870, when Germany's newly won unity was imperilled. No library, public or private, can afford to be without this invaluable 
contribution to modern history. The last volume contains a tabular view of the principal events of the time covered, and a voluminous index 
to the seven volumes. 

Workingmen's Insurance. 

By WILLIAM F. WILLOUGHBT, United States Department of Labor. (Vol. XIV. in Crowelfs Library of Economics andPolitics.) 

12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

This is a painstaking and exhaustive examination of the problem of the insurance of workingmen against accident, sickness, and old age. 
There is no work quite like it. It coven foreign systems of compulsory insurance, the various forms of insurance resulting from the voluntary 
efforts of employers and workingmen, the relief departments organized by railway companies and other large employers of labor, and the insur- 
ance work of labor unions in the United States and abroad. The author has had exceptional opportunities for obtaining facts at first hand ; and 
his work appeals to all students of social conditions, to those engaged in the management of insurance and relief organizations, and to those who 
are involved in the vexed question of employers' liability. 

Congressional Committees. 

By LAUKOS G. McCoNACHiE, Ph.D. (Vol. XV. in CrowelVs Library of Economics and Politics.) 12mo, cloth. (In press.) 
Dr. McConachie defines Congressional Committees as "the agents, the instruments, the channels of connection, between Congress and the 
nation." With the expansion in recent years, growing ever more and more rapid, of population and complicated interests throughout our land, 
" the cumbersome organization of slower days " was subjected to a strain it could not bear ; and the adoption of a multiplicity of committees, each 
intrusted with some department, was the only practical way out of a vast difficulty. It illustrates evolution as working in a living, changing 
political organism, and Dr. McConachie studies its details with great care. He writes with no little vivacity, and with a wealth of interesting 
illustration. 

What is Art? 

By COUNT LYOF N. TOLSTOI. Authorized Edition. Translated from the Russian by Ay Imer Maude. 12mo, cloth. (In press.) 

ADVANCE NOTICE FROM THE LONDON DAILY CHRONICLE. 

"Of all the essays in criticism, morals, or social economics which Tolstoi has given us since he gave up the production of his own great 
works of art, this is as characteristic and far-reaching as any. And probably it will be read with even greater interest, for the solution which it 
suggests, though certainly not more important than his primitive Christian morality, comes to us with greater freshness, and is in more direct 
contradiction, not merely to generally recognized practice, but to all modern theories and doctrines openly and universally proclaimed as to the 
meaning and value of Art. ... It is a great theory, such as we should have expected from the great living prophet." 

Brunetiere's Manual of the History of French Literature. 

Authorized translation. Illustrated with portraits. 12mo, cloth. (In press.) 

M. Brunetiere, the famous French critic, stands decidedly for a conservative criticism ; and his latest and most important work may be counted 
on as sound, reliable, dignified, and wise. The work is brought down to the year 1875, including in this " modern age " the epoch of Naturalism. 
The style is charming, and the suggestiveness of the thought makes it * model manual for the student and general reader who desires a solid 
groundwork in French literature. _ ___^__ _

Pennsylvania; Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and of the American Asso-

THE SKELETON OF THE CAT. - ; 

ITS MUSCULAB ATTACHMENTS, GBOWTH, AND VARIATIONS COMPARED WITH 

THE SKELETON OF 



Eight Hundred Pages. With over Five Hundred Original Illustrations, and many 
Tables. One Volume. Imperial Octavo. Price, Five Dollars. 

THIS volume is the first of a series which aims to present a more accurate and more com- 
prehensive description of the structure of a typical mammal than has been hitherto 
attempted. This treatise may be, therefore, regarded as a monograph on a typical 
mammal, and be employed as an introduction to general comparative anatomy; and inasmuch 
as in its general scope, in its methods of description, in the prominence given to practical detail 
and comparison, and as far as possible in its terminology, it is in accord with the standard text- 
books on human anatomy, it may be confidently used in preparation for the study of human 
anatomy, especially by those who propose to enter a medical course. 

Although the present volume is the first of a series, nevertheless it is complete in itself, and 
is an introduction to comparative osteology. While it deals largely with general principles, it 
is mainly an exhaustive study of the skeleton of a typical mammal, the cat, followed by close 
comparisons with the human skeleton. It is based entirely upon original investigations extend- 
ing through many years, and is illustrated with a wealth of new and original engravings. Un- 
usual prominence is given to the explanation of all technical terms and to such practical sug- 
gestions for study as will enable a student to grasp the subject without previous anatomical 
training. Peculiar features of the work are: the description and classification of all recorded 
variations and anomalies ; the introduction of rules for making comparative measurements ; the 
identification of the processes of development in skeletons of animals of known ages ; and the 
determination of the exact attachments of the muscles. Many details of the subject, which are 
not usually considered in works on osteology, such as the bony labyrinth of the ear, the nasal 
cavities, the nasal bones, and the teeth, are treated with great fulness. 

The author's long experience with elementary classes has led to the adoption of those methods 
of instruction which are best calculated to train the powers of observation and to stimulate the 
interest of the student.

NEW BOOKS OF VALUE. 



Spain in the Nineteenth Century. 

By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LA TIMER. With many 
portraits, 82.50. 

" With regret one notes that Elizabeth Wormeley Larimer's ' Spain 
in the 19th Century ' is to be the last of her excellent aeries of 19th 
century histories. We have come to look upon Mrs. Latimer as quite 
the most delightful purveyor of historical gossip to be found anywhere. 
In successiTe volumes she has sketched the external events in the cen- 
tury hi France, Russia, England, Africa, Italy, and Spain, and this final 
volume is perhaps the most timely and the most needed of alL" The 
Chicago Tribune. 

" The entire series is well planned and commendably executed. " 
The Outlook. 

Mrs. Latimer' 1 s successful Historical Sketches of the 19th 
Century, illustrated and uniform tcith "Spain," previously 
published, are: 

France in the 19th Century $2.50 

Russia and Turkey in the 19th Century . 2.50 

England in the 1 9th Century 2.50 

Europe in Africa in the 1 9th Century . . 2.50 
Italy in the 19th Century 2.50 

Christianity, the World - Religion. 

By Rev. JOHN HENRY BARROWS. Large 12mo, 81.50. 

The first course of the " Barrows Lectureship " delivered in India 
and Japan in 1896-97. 

"The reception these lectures met with from Hindus, Buddhists, 
and Mohammedans was a testimony not only to the ability of the lec- 
turer and the personal esteem he has won, but also to the new appre- 
ciation which an unsectarian Christianity is gaining among the people 
of the East." Christian World (London, England). 

" The book is on broad and primary lines, and as a statement of the 
claims of Christianity to be, not one among the many religions, but the 
one religion that can alone fill the requirements of a universal system, 
it has a missionary importance that is new and profitable." The Bal- 
timore Sun. 

A World - Pilgrimage. 

By Key. JOHX HENRY BARROWS. Illustrated. Crown 
8vo, S2.00. 

" Dr. Barrows is a strong, open-minded, open-eyed man of the kind 
who make good observers and interesting reporters. " Independent. 

" We are glad to have been represented abroad by so splendid a gen- 
tleman and scholar and ambassador of Christianity, and we are almost 
if not quite equally glad to have had so charming and cultured a friend 
travel in our interest, so to speak, and record for us impressions so emi- 
nently readable as these. . . . Ability and opportunity together have 
produced a book which does not contain a dull line, or one without sig- 
nificance." Interior (Chicago). 

" A bright, charming book of travel, and well-named ' A World- 
Pilgrimage.' ... A delightful book, full of push and force, and just as 
American as it can be." Living Church (Chicago). 

A Group of French Critics. 

By MARY FISHER. 12mo, 81.25. 

" This is a little book full of learning and sound taste which will help 
Americans to understand what French literature really stands for, and 
to distinguish between the shallow and ephemeral productions of the 
modern Parisian school of fiction and poetry, and what is really sound 
and good in French literature. . . . The author renders the reading 
public a real service by presenting so able an advocate for the pure and 
beautiful in literature." Philadelphia Inquirer. 



Stories from Italy. 



By G. S. GODKIN. 12mo, gilt top, 81.25. 

"Mr. Godkin'a modest little volume of ' Stories from Italy ' will be 
read with appreciation by persons who value polished, finished style, 
quiet observation, and the delicate portrayal of scenes that are often 
touched with irony and humor." Literature. 

" The author of this book has provided for his readers a volume of 
exceedingly attractive narratives." Home Journal (New York). 

" Very agreeable and exceptionally well-told tales they prove to be. " 
Detroit free Prett. 



With a Pessimist in Spain. 

By MARY F. NIXON. Illustrated. 12mo, $1.50. 

11 We do not recall reading of late any traveller's record which gives 
ns in pictorial story so much of the historic and artistic treasure* of 
Old Spain." The Boston Evening Trantcript. 

" A brief and agreeable book of travels." The Dial. 

" The author travels through Spain with the most observant eyes, 
and with a heart full of sympathy for the grand old Moorish pact, and 
for what is good in the degenerate present. ... It is a most chatty 
and readable book." The Saturday Evening Gazette (Boston). 

An Imperial Lover. 

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR. 12mo, $1.25. 

" A dramatic and intensely interesting semi-historical romance of 
Peter the Great's court." The Evening Bulletin (Philadelphia). 

" The tale is one of love, of intrigue, and of adventure, and seems 
to us even better than its predecessor (' On the Bed Staircase ')." 
The Outlook. 

" The story is stirring and absorbing, while it does not resort to the 
narration of deeds of violence to catch and hold the attention. It is 
purely a love theme, and well worked out. In many respects this book 
is superior to its predecessor." The Star (Washington, D. C.). 

By the Same Author. 

On the Red Staircase. 

By M. IMLAY TAYLOR. 12mo, $1.25. 

" A most vivid and absorbing tale of love and adventure. ... It 
wfll give a far truer, because more striking and life-like, picture of 
early Russian history, than a multitude of laboriously-written and pon- 
derous histories of the times." The Churchman (New York). 

The Story of Language. 

By CHARLES WOODWARD HTJTSON. 12mo, 81.50. 

Though students of language and philologists wfll be immediately 
attracted by the native scope and skill of the work, it is of so varied and 
ultimate interest to all studiously intelligent readers that its reach 
is rather catholic than restricted." The Washington Time*. 

" A lucid exposition of a topic that a multitude of minds wfll find 
fascinating." The Pret* (Philadelphia). 

"The treatise is infused with scholarship on every page." Com- 
mercial Advertiser (New York). 

Notes on the Nicaragua Canal. 

By HENRY I. SHELDON, with maps and illustrations. 
8vo, 81.25. 

" Mr. Sheldon has rendered a great service to those particularly in- 
terested in the canal scheme, not the projector or the engineer, but the 
business man who wishes to create more business, and at the same 
time to help to extend the power of the Republic." Engineering 
(London, Eng.). 

" Mr. Sheldon has learned the secret of a terse and simple style, 
which, while readable and interesting, is also admirably adapted to 
further an enterprise of very great importance to the country. Several 
good maps and numerous illustrations add to the value of the volume." 
Public Ledger (Philadelphia). 

Thoughts and Theories 

of Life and Education. 

By the Rt. Rev. J. L. SPALDING. 12mo, 81.00. 

" It is a brilliant book hi which thought and style are equally ad- 
mirable. ... It is eloquent and stimulating, and is written by a 
thinker of lofty thought and a lover of his kind, and it will be read with 
delight by serious thinkers everywhere." Saturday Evening Gazette 
(Boston).

what must be regarded as a standard work.

THE PLIGHT OF THE BOOKSELLER. 

For some months now a three-sided discus- 
sion of the most heated and acrimonious sort 
has been going on in England with regard to the 
mutual relations of the author, the publisher, 
and the bookseller. Not only are the trade- 
journals and the periodical organs of the spe- 
cial interests concerned filled with pleas and 
arguments upon the several phases of this com- 
plex problem, but the debate has established a 
firm foothold in the columns of the daily news- 
paper and the pages of the popular magazine. 
It is indeed a question in which the general 
public has a legitimate interest, for in these 



days of common school education we are all 
readers to an extent of which our forefathers 
never dreamed, and the average man, who is 
neither author, publisher, nor bookseller, feels 
instinctively that his own notions of what is 
proper should count for a good deal in any 
matter which places the cost of books at stake. 
In this respect, as in so many others, the great 
public is apt to disregard the nicer ethical con- 
siderations involved in the discussion, and to 
insist upon the cheapest books he can get re- 
gardless of the ways in which they may be 
cheapened for him. In our own country we 
had abundant opportunity to realize the force 
of this sentiment during our long struggle for 
the embodiment of common honesty in the copy- 
right laws, and just now we realize it anew in 
contemplation of the opposition to which an 
important reform in our postal regulations has 
had to succumb. 

The English agitation of this question takes 
its origin in the sufferings of the bookseller, from 
whom there arises a bitter cry of lessened pro- 
fits and lowered prestige. It all comes from 
the current discount of twenty-five per cent 
from the published prices of books, a discount 
forced by keen competition and now so firmly 
established by custom that it seems like a part 
of the English Constitution. We will cheer- 
fully give you two pence in the shilling, says 
the aggrieved bookseller, but to give three 
pence is to take the bread from our mouths. 
Striking figures are presented in behalf of this 
plea, as in the case of one respected represen- 
tative of the trade, who shows that an annual 
turnover of three thousand pounds with a two 
penny discount will yield a greater profit than 
a turnover of ten thousand pounds under the 
conditions now existing. The publishers, for 
their part, claim that they would gladly help 
the booksellers to a decent living, but are quite 
helpless to do so, since the large dealers are 
satisfied to allow a three penny discount, and 
the small dealers are forced to follow suit. But 
no, say the boooksellers, just see how they do 
things in Germany. In that happy land, deal- 
ers are forced to accept a discount based upon 
an equitable consideration of the interests of 
both parties, because the publishers would cut 
short the supplies of any bookseller who should 
violate this agreement by underselling his fel- 
low-tradesmen. Our safety is in the trust and 



174 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



the boycott, and we call upon you to aid us in 
fastening these beneficent limitations upon our 
trade. Very well, say the publishers, only we 
must get the assent of the authors also, for with- 
out them our efforts would prove futile. The 
author is thus dragged into the dispute, but, to 
the dismay of the bookseller, proves recalci- 
trant. What I want, he says in substance to the 
bookseller, is the largest possible sale for my 
works, and so does my publisher, since his pro- 
fit and my royalty are in strict proportion to 
these sales. You, on the other hand, given 
your additional penny, would be better off, on 
your own showing, were you to sell less than 
half as many books. I know that I am tra- 
ditionally incompetent in matters of business, 
but I am not so guileless as all that. The pres- 
ent arrangement suits me quite well, and in en- 
deavoring to upset it I should be working 
against my own interests. In this seemingly 
hopeless impasse the discussion stands. 

In our own country, the problem is slightly 
different, although in its essentials much the 
same. With us, the authors, for lack of any 
organization corresponding to what obtains in 
England, do not form a third party to the dis- 
cussion, which is thus reduced to a struggle 
between publishers and booksellers. The bug- 
bear of the latter is not the regular discount 
allowed everywhere by honest retailers, but the 
department store with its cut prices, its prompt 
turnover, and its efficient organization. The 
very striking statement was recently made that 
one of these stores, on account of its advantage 
over the ordinary bookseller in the concession 
of from two to six per cent for short time pay- 
ments, could afford to retail an invoice of books 
" for the net cost of the bill and still leave a 
profit." At such a statement the mere book- 
seller may well hold up his hands in despair, 
and look for some other means of making a 
living. Practically, he is forced to do one of 
two things : either retire from a business sub- 
ject to this sort of competition, or himself be- 
come a department store on a small scale by 
adding bicycles, and cigars, and patent medi- 
cines to his stock in trade. 

The public is to some extent at fault for this 
state of things, and the principle that every act 
of purchase is freighted with ethical and social 
responsibilities is no doubt a sound one ; but 
consumers' leagues and other devices for bet- 
tering the condition of production and exchange 
do not seem likely to accomplish very much, 
and rarely convince purchasers who are not 
more than half convinced already. The " shop- 



per " will continue to watch for " bargains," 
whether in books or in fine raiment, and is not 
easily persuaded to pay more for a given article 
than he must, or to contemplate the indirect 
consequences of his purchase when the direct 
and tangible advantage is so evident. More- 
over, the modern book-buying public is to a 
considerable extent a new public, created by 
the department store and the bargain counter. 
It would never have found its way at all into 
the real bookstore, and its acquisitions in the 
way of literature are made in delightful ignor- 
ance of the commodity which it is buying. It 
will proudly bear away its purchases of gaudy 
fabrications in cheap paper and muslin entirely 
unconscious of the fact that these things are 
not books in any real sense of the term, and 
will joy in the possession of, say, the " works " 
of Goethe (five volumes, price $1.79) without 
the least suspicion that the " works " of Goethe 
do not exist in the English language. To the 
book-lover, on the other hand, and to the book- 
buyer of the old-fashioned sort, these things 
and the marts in which they are dispensed by 
unlettered counter-jumpers are an abomination. 
He, at least, knows the difference between books 
made to read and keep and books made, like 
the spectacles in the familiar story, " to sell"; he 
also knows that the cut prices of books in the dry 
goods stores are not (with an occasional excep- 
tion) cut so very much after all, and that in such 
stores the books that the serious reader really 
wants are never by any possibility to be found. 
The bookstore, then, may be said still to re- 
tain the greater part of its old clientele, but the 
fact remains that it ought to attract the new 
class of book-buyers also, yet that somehow it 
does not attract them. The elementary eco- 
nomic forces by which society is swayed are 
pulling hard against the self-respecting book- 
seller, and more and more placing at a disad- 
vantage the intelligence which he seeks to re- 
tain in the conduct of his business and the con- 
science which the self-respecting publisher puts 
into the manufacture of his product. Now these 
economic forces are hard things to fight against ; 
they are certainly not to be combated success- 
fully by repressive legislation, as some book- 
sellers foolishly seem to wish, while such com- 
binations in restraint of trade as are here and 
there suggested are likely either to prove simply 
futile or so to outrage the moral sense (exhib- 
ited in our notions of fair play and freedom of 
individual action) as to defeat their own pur- 
pose. Measures of the first class surely cannot 
be countenanced by intelligent persons, while 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



175 



measures of the second class embody a wisdom 
almost equally dubious. What then remains? 
The answer may not be a very satisfactory one, 
but it seems to be the only one left. Economic 
forces all have their origin in the mind, and flow 
from the ideas and desires of human beings. It 
is hopeless to oppose them by violent means, 
but it is not impossible to transform them by 
educational processes. The advance of civiliza- 
tion does react upon these forces to very de- 
cided effect, and every year finds more and 
more minds prepared to receive the important 
truth that the cheapest ways of doing things 
are not always the most desirable ways. This 
truth once realized, its translation into eco- 
nomic action is a comparatively simple matter. 
Its concrete application to the case now in hand 
may be stated very briefly. A good book-store, 
stocked with serious literature, and conducted 
by people who know something of the books 
they sell, is a civilizing agency of the highest 
importance to every community. It ranks with 
the public library and the local high school or 
college. That such a book-store should be found 
in every sizable town and that every great city 
should have a number of them are propositions 
that win without argument the assent of all in- 
telligent people. That it is difficult if not im- 
possible for them to exist under the conditions 
of present competition and of present public 
sentiment is a statement sadly true. That arti- 
ficial measures for the rehabilitation of the old- 
time bookseller are foredoomed to failure is the 
outcome of all sound ethical and economic rea- 
soning. We must then look for a better state 
of affairs, on the part of the public, to a more 
genuine popular education, a broader enlighten- 
ment concerning the usefulness of books, a 
greater willingness to bear small burdens for 
the attainment of large ends ; and, on the part 
of the bookseller, more patience under adverse 
influences, a broader view of the economic prob- 
lems with which he is confronted, and a greater 
alertness to impress the public with the need- 
fulness of his own peculiar social function. 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, March 1, 1898. 

The season has commenced with a rush, and business 
is moving in dead earnest. Publishers are now engaged 
in preparing their " Spring Announcement " lists ; and 
although these are not all yet to hand, I think I can 
give you sufficient information now to put yon on a foot- 
ing of equality with ourselves in that respect, by the 
time this reaches you. Of course, a few of the more 



important works of fiction have already been issued, 
such as Mr. Anthony Hope's " Simon Dale," Mr. Stan- 
ley Weyman's " Shrewsbury," and Dr. Conan Doyle's 
"Tragedy of the Korosko"; but much yet remains ere 
the holidays come on. So that yon may be better able 
to study the titles, I give them classified, with our pub- 
lishers' names in parentheses. 

In Theology we have nothing supremely important. 
A great talk is being made of the new translation of 
the Bible, called the "Polychrome Bible"; but as the 
work is edited and sub-edited by two of your own 
scholars, yon will, no doubt, know all about it. Al- 
ready three volumes have been issued. One curious 
part about the publication of it is that two firms, Messrs. 
James Clarke & Co. and Mr. David Nntt, are both ad- 
vertising it largely, the latter not so much as the former. 
Messrs. Hutchinson announce " The Origin and Nature 
of Man," by Dr. S. B. G. McKinney, and Messrs. 
Bell; "One Thousand Years of Church History," by 
Rev. L. O. Asplen. Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton's 
" Expositor's Bible " will be completed by the issue of 
the 49th volume, called "The Book of the Twelve 
Prophets." 

History and Biography furnish a fair number of aver- 
age quality ; but none of the books promises anything 
very exciting: "Mr. Gregory's Letter-Box, 1813-30," 
edited by Lady Gregory (Smith, Elder & Co.) ; " Memoir 
of Henry Whitehead," by Canon Rawnsley (Macmillan) ; 
" Notes from a Diary, 1873-81," by Sir Mountstuart 
Grant Duff, 2 vob. (Murray); "Memorials of an 
Eighteenth Century Painter (James Northcote)," by 
Stephen Gwynn (Unwin) ; " Paul Kruger and his 
Times," by F. R. Statham (Unwin) ; " Shelley: a Mono- 
graph," by Dr. Guido Biagi (Unwin); "Masters of 
Medicine" series (Unwin), "Sir J. T. Simpson," 
"William Stokes," and "Edward Jenner"; "Build- 
ers of Greater Britain" series (Unwin), "John and 
Sebastian Cabot," and "Edward Gibbon Wakefield." 
"The Later Renaissance," by David Hannay (Black- 
woods). 

The class of books known as Travels includes quite 
a long list of really promising works. In addition to 
the expected accounts of Mr. Landor in Thibet and Mr. 
Fitzgerald on the Andes, which may be postponed un- 
til the autumn, we are promised immediately : " With 
Peary Near the Pole," by Eivind Astrup (Pearson); 
The Yukon Territory," by W. H. Dall, G. M. Daw- 
son, and J. J. Ogilvie (Downey); "Wealth and Wild 
Cats: Travels and Adventures in the Gold-Fields of 
Australia and New Zealand," by Raymond Ratclyffe 
(Downey) ; " British Columbia for Settlers," by Frances 
Macnal (Chapman & Hall); "Zanzibar and Pemba: 
Travels in the Coast Lands of British East Africa," by 
W. W. A. Fitzgerald (Chapman & Hall); "Egypt in 
the Nineteenth Century," by Donald A. Cameron 
(Smith, Elder); "Through South Africa," by H. M. 
Stanley (Low); "Through the Gold Fields of Alaska," 
by Harry De Windt (Chatto & Windus) ; Through 
the Famine Districts of India," by F. H. S. Merewether 
(A.D. Innes); "Ireland '98 to '98," by J. O'Connor 
Morris (Innes) ; " Through Persia on a Side Saddle," 
by Ella C. Sykes (Innes); "Through the High Pyre- 
nees," by Harold Spender and Llewellyn Smith (Innes) ; 
" Five Years in Siam," by H. Warington Smyth, 2 vob. 
(Murray); "Through Unknown Tibet," by Capt. M. S. 
Welby (Unwin); " The Jew, the Gypsy, and El-Islam," 
by Capt. Sir Richard Burton (Hntchinson) ; a new edi- 
tion, with Introduction by Stanley Lane Poole, of Bur-

ton's famous " Pilgrimage to Meccah and El-Madinah," 
(Bell). 

There are no important Art Books, unless I make 
exceptions of " The Bases of Design," by Walter Crane 
(Bell), just published, and a fine work on " Charles the 
First," by Sir John Skelton, announced by Bussod, Val- 
ladon & Co. The rest are mainly new editions: "Art 
and Life of William Morris," by Aymer Vallance (Bell) ; 
" Lord Leighton: his Life and Work," by Ernest Rhys, 
edited by Gleeson White (Bell); "The Pilgrim's Pro- 
gress," edited by Rev. H. R. Haweis, and illustrated by 
G. W. Rhead, F. A. Rhead, and Louis Rhead (Pear- 
son) ; " English Portraits," by Will Rothenstein (Grant 
Richards). A fine work on the paintings of the por- 
traits of Christ will be " Rex Regum," by Sir Wyke 
Bayliss (Bell) ; the book is to be most extensively illus- 
trated from the pictures of the best masters. 

Every season brings us its quota of works on Sport, 
and among these may be now mentioned : " Encyclo- 
pedia of Sport," Vol. II. (Lawrence & Bullen); " Isth- 
mian Library " (Innes): " Rowing," by R. C. Lehmann; 
"Figure Skating," by M. S. Monies Williams; "The 
World of Golf," by Garden Smith; "Sailing Boats and 
Small Yachts," by E. F. Knight; "The Deer of All 
Lands," by R. Lyddeker; "History of the Bramham 
Moor Hunt," by W. S. Dixon ; " Dumb Bells," by F. Graf 
(Bell); and Cycle Touring," by A. W. Rumney (Bell). 

As is usual with " Spring publications," by far the 
larger proportion of them belong to fiction. This year, 
the novels promise to be of more than the average num- 
ber, and quite of the average quality. M. Zola's " Paris " 
has, of course, been delayed owing to the implication of 
the author with the Dreyfus case; and "lota's" "Poor 
Max " (Hutchinson), has just been issued and received 
as the best work Mrs. Mannington Caffyn has yet writ- 
ten. It would take one too long to go through each 
item separately, and, indeed, the greater number might 
not be worth the trouble; so that I will simply list them: 
"Lady Jezebel," by Fergus Hume (Pearson); "The 
Master Key," by Florence Warden (Pearson); "The 
Virgin of the Sun," by George Griffith (Pearson); 
" The Rev. Annabel Lee," by Robert Buchanan (Pear- 
son) ; " The Keepers of the People," by Edgar Jepson 
(Pearson). In their " Latter-Day Stories," Messrs. 
Pearson announce: "Van Wagner's Ways," by W. L. 
Alden, "An Egyptian Coquette," by Clive Holland, " In 
Male Attire," by Joseph Hatton, " An Episode in Ar- 
cady," by Halliwell Sutcliffe, " Trincolox," by Douglas 
Sladen, " A Russian Vagabond," by Fred Whishaw, 
" From Veld and Mine," by George Griffith. Messrs. 
F. V. White & Co. have " nearly ready ": " The Peace- 
makers," by John Strange Winter; " Scribes and Phar- 
isees," by W. Le Queux; " Little Miss Prim," by Flor- 
ence Warden; "The House of Mystery," by Richard 
Marsh; and "Blanche Coningham's Surrender," by 
Jean Middlemass. Mr. Grant Richards has three im- 
portant novels: "The Wheel of God," by George Eg- 
erton; " A True Heart," by Frederick Breton; and 
" Convict 99," by Marie Connor and Robert Leighton. 
In addition to these, he is preparing a very beautiful 
edition de luxe of the novels of Jane Austen, to be issued 
in a limited edition, and in style like the " Edinburgh" 
Stevenson. Messrs. Downey & Co. have, of course, the 
continuing volumes of their " Illustrated Edition " of 
the novels of Charles Lever, and the " Wormeley " 
Balzac in 40 volumes. They also announce : " In the 
Promised Land," by Mary Anderson; "Bruising Peg," 
by Paul Creswick; "The Story of an Ocean Tramp," 



by Capt. C. Clarke. Messrs. Hutchinson & Co. have " in 
preparation": "Woman and the Shadow," by Arabella 
Kenealy; " The Prince's Diamond," by E. H. Beaman; 
and " Wyndham's Daughter," by Annie S. Swan. The 
one novel of which Messrs. Blackwood & Co. make a 
special point is, " A Forgotten Sin," by Dorothea Ger- 
ard. Mr. Heinemann has already published most of his 
stories ; there are left but two important volumes to ap- 
pear: "The Scourge Stick," by Mrs. Campbell-Praed, 
and " The Dreamers of the Ghetto," by I. Zangwill. 
Smith, Elder & Co. announce: " Senorita Montenar,"by 
A. P. Crouch; " The Ambition of Judith," by Olive Bir- 
rell. Messrs. Innes & Co. have the following on their list: 
Children of the Mist," by Eden Phillpotts; " Sunlight 
and Limelight," by Francis Gribble; " The Indiscretions 
of Lady Asenath," by Basil Thomson; "A Woman's 
Privilege," by Marguerite Bryant; "The Island of the 
Seven Shadows," by Roma White; "The St. Cadix 
Case," by Esther Miller. Mr. T. Fisher Unwin's " Cen- 
tury " edition of Scott's novels in twenty-five small fools- 
cap volumes is to sweep the market for Scott. 

Among the Miscellaneous classifications I note: " Es- 
says," by Leslie Stephen, 2 vols. (Duckworth); "Side 
Lights on Siberia," by J. Y. Simpson (Blackwoods) ; 
" Songs of England," by Alfred Austin (Macmillan) ; 
Swift's Prose Works (10 vols.), Vols. III. and IV., 
edited by Temple Scott (Bell); Bishop Berkeley's 
Works (3 vols.), Vols. II. and III., edited by George 
Sampson (Bell); Collier's "Annals of the Stage" (2 
vols.) (Bell) ; " Quatrains of Omar Khayyam," trans- 
lated by John Payne (Villon Society) ; " Our Foods and 
Drinks," by Dr. Andrew Wilson (Pearson); "The 
Great French Triumvirate," translations from Moliere, 
Racine, and Corneille, by Thomas Constable (Downey) ; 
"Mad Humanity," by S. Forbes Winslow (Pearson); 
" The London Lover's Enchiridion," edited by Wilfrid 
Whitten (Grant Richards) ; " The Construction of Ma- 
rine Boilers," by L. S. Robertson and Sir W. White 
(Murray); "Railway Construction," by W. H. Mills 
(Longmans) ; Brunetiere's " Essays in French Litera- 
ture," translated by D. Nichol Smith (Unwin) ; " Karl 
Marx and the Close of his System," by E. V. Bohm- 
Bawerk, translated by Alice M. Macdonald (Unwin). 

As I am finishing this letter, Messrs. Methuen's list

lish the following works on Africa: " Three Years in 
Savage Africa," by Lionel Decle; " Campaigning on the 
Upper Nile and Niger," by Lieut. Seymour Vandelear; 
" Niger Sources," by Colonel Trotter; " With the Mash- 
onaland Field Force, 1896," by Lieut.-Col. Alderson. 
Mr. John Murray also announces five new volumes of 
his " University Extension Manuals"; these are: " In- 
troduction to Physical Science," by Prof. John Cox; 
" The English Poets from Blake to Tennyson," by Rev. 
Stopford Brooke; "History of Astronomy," by Arthur 
Berry; " History of Education," by Principal Donaldson; 
and " Introduction to Philosophy," by Prof. W. Knight. 

Sir Walter Besant's " The Changeling " will not be 
issued until the autumn; the story has first to run a 
serial course in " Chapman's Magazine." Serial publi- 
cation will defer the book issues of the stories by 
H. Seton Merriman, Stanley Weyman, A. Conan Doyle, 
S. R. Crockett, and one or two others, which have 
already been announced. I learn that Mr. Harold Fred- 
eric has just finished what he considers a very powerful 
novel. Its title has not yet been fixed; but, in any case, 
it will not appear before the autumn.

AN EXPONENT OF PRE-RAPHAEUSM.* 

It is many years since Miss Francesca Alex- 
ander first became known in the art world as 
a person of pen-and-ink importance. So far 
back as 1855, Mr. Motley admired her draw- 
ings with some extravagance of statement ; and 
much later, when Mr. Buskin chanced to meet 
her in Florence and saw her work, he made 
haste to place her among the immortals with 
Holman Hunt and others of the Pre-Raphaelite 
faith. The immediate cause of Mr. Ruskin's 
admiration was a portfolio of 109 drawings in 
pen-and-ink, illustrating and decorating the 
songs of the Tuscan peasantry. He took these 
drawings with him to England, talked about 
them in his Oxford lectures, presented a num- 
ber of them to the university, to St. George's 
Museum, and to other schools where he lec- 
tured. Twenty or more of the plates were 
photographed at the time, and, with Miss Alex- 
ander's translations and Mr. Ruskin's editorial 
comments, they made up the book of 1884 
called " Roadside Songs of Tuscany." Since 
then, photographic processes have been so much 
improved that it has been possible to reproduce 
all of the original plates line for line. This has 
been recently done in photogravure, by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co., and the result is the 
complete and very handsome quarto of 1897 
called " Tuscan Songs." 

For the songs themselves, and their transla- 
tion by Miss Alexander, there is little now to 
be said except in praise. The poetry of them 
their lyric element is not great ; but they 
are the records of faith, hope, and sentiment 
among the Tuscan peasantry, and Miss Alex- 
ander has brought them together believing that 
the best of them should be preserved. The ex- 
amples given are but the siftings from many 
hundreds of songs heard and remembered in 
Tuscany, where Miss Alexander has spent the 
greater part of her life. Some of them were 
taught her by Beatrice Bernardi of Pian degli 
Ontani a local improvisatrice and others 
came to her at odd times and in strange ways. 
The music to them was written by Signora Ses- 
tilia Poggiali ; and Miss Alexander, after the 
task of translation, put her pen at work beautify- 
ing the pages with initials, borders, and full-page

illustrations. What artistic quality the work 
possesses lies in the illustrations ; and it is with 
them that popular interest will be chiefly con- 
cerned. 

One may as well acknowledge at the start 
that Miss Alexander has done her work with 
sincerity, and that she has spared neither time 
nor labor to make it beautiful. The spirit she 
brought to it was conscientious and sympathetic. 
Indeed, Mr. Rnskin thought her peculiar art 
gift was sympathy " the gift of truest expres- 
sion of feelings serene in their Tightness." The 
frontispiece drawing to the " Story of Ida," one 
of Miss Alexander's earlier books, shows infi- 
nite tenderness and feeling, and it is not to be 
wondered at that one of Mr. Ruskin's faith 
should be allured by the spirit of the worker. 
Still, he was not wholly blinded. He admitted 
that Miss Alexander had faults, but thought 
them more than atoned for by the virtue of sin- 
cerity. And that is quite true ; but Mr. Rus- 
kin was hardly the right one to say it. For the 
faults of Miss Alexander's drawing were of his 
planting. It was his writing and teaching that 
led her into error. He says evidently intend- 
ing it in commendation that her work is " dis- 
tinguished by the faculty and habit of realiza- 
tion which belongs to all Pre-Raphaelism." 
Yes ; and what a pity ! That is the error of it 
the error of Pre-Raphaelism, and Mr. Rus- 
kin, and Miss Alexander. And it all came about 
from a misconception of the early Italian paint- 
ers the painters before Raphael. It was dis- 
covered (let us say, for the sake of argument, 
by Mr. Ruskin) that these painters had a won- 
derful charm of sincerity and honesty in their 
paintings, that they convinced one by their 
truth, their frankness, their earnestness of 
statement. It was also discovered that they 
did everything, from high to low, with an ex- 
acting detail, making much of flowers and 
grasses, and dwelling long upon such things as 
patterns, brocades, and jewels. Immediately 
the conclusion was jumped at that the fine 
spirit of a Botticelli or a Carpaccio was the re- 
sult of a " loving care " in the handling of de- 
tail. Then it was further concluded that the 
spirit could be regained by the moderns if they 
would but take up the detail with the same " lov- 
ing care." The result was Pre-Raphaelism in 
England, with Holman Hunt, Millais, and Ros- 
setti as disciples, Mr. Ruskin as prophet, and, 
far on the outside of the circle, such people as 
Miss Alexander taking an impulse from the 
movement. CJfflW 

The early Italians, it may be said, painted

in detail, not necessarily because they loved 
detail as such, but because they could not by 
any chance paint in any other way. It is char- 
acteristic of youth that it sees things in the 
part before it grasps or comprehends them as 
a whole. Every beginner paints the leaves 
upon the tree before he understands the mean- 
ing or significance of the forest. In other 
words, the power of generalization is not given 
to either the youthful painter or the youth- 
ful race. The fifteenth century Italians painted 
in a small way because they were immature. 
When the race and the art reached an apo- 
gee with Titian at Venice, the manner of see- 
ing and painting was wholly changed. Nature 
was summarized and synthesized ; the great 
truths were given, and the small details were 
subordinated. 

But Mr. Ruskin has never recognized the 
immaturity of the detail view, and he has more 
than once scolded himself red in the face over 
the studio doctrine of subordination. As for 
his disciples, most of the Pre-Raphaelites aban- 
doned the brotherhood and its small realism at 
an early day ; and from those, like Kolman 
Hunt, who have clung to the faith, there has 
resulted only incomplete work. This was to be 
expected. For all art movements that try to 
turn the world backward by reproducing past 
art usually seize upon the shortcomings and 
mannerisms of the imitated. Pre-Raphaelism 
was no exception. It persistently grasped at 
the detail and consistently lost the ensemble. 
This is Miss Alexander's crying fault, and yet, 
paradoxical as it may sound, it is her technical 
virtue. Detail is not objectionable in such 
things as a branch, a flower, a vine ; and Miss 
Alexander shows us by the spray of blossoms 
in the half-title to her book how really beautiful 
it may be when set apart by itself. But a car- 
rying out of this detail in a tree would result 
in something of metal-like rigidity having no 
possible relation to the earth, air, or sky. And 
Pre-Raphaelism insisted upon carrying out the 
principle of detail in every kind of composition. 
Miss Alexander shows it to us in Plate 84, 
representing the Child lying upon a heap of 
hay. The hay is drawn line upon line with 
minute precision, and as a result it has no elas- 
ticity about it. It is, in fact, as hard as wire. 
In Plate 29, showing the Madonna and the 
Rich Man, there is no end of detail lavished 
upon the pots and the plants at the right ; but 
the relation between the foreground, middle 
distance, and background, is lost. The hair 



and the head of the Rich Man are minutely 
done, but the head does not fit the body, and 
the figures do not fit the courtyard where they 
are supposed to be standing. Of course Miss 
Alexander, like her master, scorns all the studio 
teachings of subordination, of values, of the 
relations of light and dark. She is seeking 
truth, not studio devices ; but does she attain 
it ? Yes ; she gains the small truths of leaf and 
wrinkle and eyelash, but she loses the great 
truth of unity. One might go on, and suggest 
that in Plate 33 she has given figures and a 
room, but not a room with figures ; that Plate 42 
shows figures and a landscape, but not a land- 
scape with figures. In almost all of the larger 
compositions the insubordinate prominence of 
the petty features hurts the unity of the mass. 
Notice the wall under the window in Plate 61, 
how it comes forward out of the picture ; and 
in Plate 88, how the whole room falls to pieces 
to give place to the figures. There is an imp 
of compensation that follows minute realization. 
You may gain the surface but lose the sub- 
stance, gain a figure but lose the room, gain a 
bush but lose the landscape. 

And yet, when one has had his fling at Pre- 
Raphaelism he may be very far from thinking 
the work of its exponents wholly worthless. 
One may find fault with Miss Alexander's 
drawing for its want of knowledge or its abund- 
ance of bias, and yet see much to be admired 
in her book of illustrations. Certainly its best 
quality is the spirit with which it is imbued ; 
but, aside from that, there are many small 
decorative features of much beauty. The 
flowers, stems, and vines woven between the 
lettered text are excellent in every way, and 
remind one of the fine illustrations by Mr. 
Ruskin made so many years ago for " Modern 
Painters." In themselves these are quite suffi- 
cient to carry the book and give it more than 
a passing interest. The frontispiece, showing 
a single portrait figure, is also exceptionally 
vital ; and there are a number of large illus- 
trations, such as Plates 59, 91, and 101, of 
unusual charm. One may differ with the prin- 
ciple upon which the work is done without ques- 
tioning either the spirit or the ability of the 
worker. Pre-Raphaelism was both a success 
and a failure. It started on a wrong principle, 
but worked out its own salvation by dint of 
native ability and industry. The same thing 
might be said of both Mr. Ruskin and his pro- 
tegee, Miss Alexander.

A FRENCH CRITIC'S STUDY OF WORDS- 
WORTH.* 



In his preface to " The Excursion," Words- 
worth alludes to a previous, though unpub- 
lished, poem of his own as " biographical, and 
conducting the history of the author's mind to 
the point when he was emboldened to hope that 
his faculties were sufficiently matured for enter- 
ing upon the arduous labor which he had pro- 
posed to himself " (in writing "The Recluse," 
of which " The Excursion " was to stand as the 
second portion). Hesitating to lay before the 
public anything which dwelt at such length 
with his own experience, until such time as his 
apparent self-glorification should have been 
justified by the completion of "The Recluse," 
the poem alluded to " The Prelude " 
although written in its author's prime, was 
not published until after his death, fifty years 
later. 

In general, critics have assumed the reader's 
knowledge of this unique autobiographical 
poem. A Frenchman, Monsieur Emile Lego- 
uis, believing that its import has not been suffi- 
ciently recognized by Wordsworth's own coun- 
trymen, finds in the poem the material for a 
more intelligent understanding of Words- 
worth's character and inner life than has before 
been made. He undertakes to give as com- 
plete an account of it as direct quotation, sup- 
plemented by analysis, can convey ; to explain 
or amplify it by means of all the obtainable evi- 
dence in the shape of Wordsworth's other 
poems, together with his own and his friends' 
correspondence ; to determine the allusions, and 
to assign to each particular fact its full impor- 
tance by giving a suitable account of its relations 
to history. A few chapters in conclusion are 
given to an analysis of the work of Words- 
worth's maturity ; but in the main the work is, as 
its title indicates, devoted to "The Early Life of 
William Wordsworth," ending with his twenty- 
eighth year, the period covered by "The 
Prelude." It is a highly interesting study, is 
ably translated by Mr. J. W. Matthews, and 
makes a volume of nearly five hundred octavo 
pages. 

Scarcely any English poet has been the sub- 
ject of so frequent or so voluminous criticism 
as William Wordsworth. Beginning with 
DeQuincey, most of these have agreed in assign- 
ing Wordsworth's optimistic habit of mind to

his exceptionally favored lot in life. M. Le- 
gouis, however, reminds us that Wordsworth's 
lot was not in itself propitious, but the reverse ; 
and reveals to us that his happiness and optim- 
ism were due to the conscious action of the will, 
and to deliberate choice, that, indeed, he 
affords a most conclusive example of the power 
of the will over the formation of ideas and the 
ordering of existence. Having resolved to be 
happy, and having arrived at a clear perception 
of the necessary means, Wordsworth held with 
invincible tenacity to that line of life and 
thought which in his opinion must lead to hap- 
piness. In order to attain this end, he employed 
all his individual gifts, his rare powers of mind, 
his genius even, and his insight into nature ; 
and to this extent there is an incommunicable 
element in his method. But it is the effort, the 
unflinching resistance to despondency, that con- 
stitutes the great moral lesson of his life ; a 
lesson which, in spite of differences in individ- 
ual capacity, is of general applicability. From 
a literary point of view, also, the work is in- 
structive as explaining Wordsworth's isolated 
position amidst a murmuring and rebellious 
generation. Reviewing the well-known facts of 
Wordsworth's life, our critic finds them melan- 
choly rather than enviable. 

" Can a man be reckoned a favorite of fortune when 
he has lost his mother during his eighth year, and his 
father at sixteen; when he has been arbitrarily deprived 
of his inheritance, has had to endure a humiliating exist- 
ence under the roof of stern and narrow-minded grand- 
parents, and for years has been coldly treated by his 
relations on account of his indolence, his obstinacy, and 
his refusal to embark upon any of the safe careers sug- 
gested to him; when he is kept apart from the sister he 
loves beyond everything else, apparently from fear that 
she may become contaminated by his disobedience and 
his subversive opinions; when he entrusts all his dreams 
of happiness to the French Revolution, only to see them 
borne under in the tempest, and loses not only his respect 
and love for his native country, but all hope of progress 
as well ; when, meanwhile, his existence is so straitened, 
so penurious even, and so utterly without promise for the 
morrow, that he is compelled to pospone indefinitely his 
union with his sister's friend, that maiden, chosen long 
ago, and now beloved, whom he knows not whether he 
can ever make his wife ? " 

The real theme of " The Prelude," according 
to M. Legouis, is the wonderful way in which 
the man contrived to profit by circumstances in 
themselves either indifferent, or favorable and 
unfavorable by turns, so as to attain to a joyous 
harmony of all his faculties. It is less a nar- 
rative than a study of origins ; less the history 
of a man than a philosophy of a mind. Far 
from being egoistic, it is broadly human ; the 
poet chooses himself for hero simply because he

can fathom no other soul so deeply, because 
there is no other from which he could derive so 
many fresh and indubitable truths. 

Moreover, Wordsworth's biography becomes 
almost an inward history of his generation. To 
learn how, in his case, manhood was developed 
out of early youth, is to learn how the nine- 
teenth century was born from the eighteenth, 
so different, yet with so manifest a family 
likeness. 

The moral crisis of Wordsworth's life came, 
as it did for so many of his contemporaries, in 
connection with the progress of the French 
Revolution. The visions of approaching uni- 
versal happiness which flashed before men's 
eyes in 1789 were speedily converted into dis- 
cord. Elements which it had seemed possi- 
ble to reconcile were discovered to be radically 
opposed: humanitarian faith was superseded 
by pessimism. The tranquility of his old age 
came out of such storm and stress ; the stages 
of recovery from the blight of the years between 
1792 and 1795 were slow but sure. The prin- 
cipal remedial agents were, first, the combina- 
tion of circumstances which restored him to a 
country home and to an atmosphere of nature 
where alone he could breathe freely ; and, sec- 
ond, the companionship of his sister Dorothy, 
the being he loved best in the world. With 
such protection and support, gradually he 
recovered what he had lost a moral equilib- 
rium as perfect as any poet has ever enjoyed. 

Dorothy Wordsworth was something more 
than a companion whose affection is merely 
soothing. She had a measure of genius pecu- 
liar to herself, at once active and alluring. She 
was not content with a mere passive admiration 
of her brother. With all her faith in him, the 
greatness which her wishes as well as her fancy 
anticipated for him was of a particular kind. 
Very early she decided in her own heart that 
he would be a poet, and made up her mind also 
as to the sort of a poet he would be. Indeed, 
it is vain to attempt to distinguish the share 
each had in their mutual observations of na- 
ture. On every page of Dorothy's journals are 
touches of description which give rise to some 
of Wordsworth's best lines. To the maiden 
who saw with, and sometimes for, the poet, yet 
left to him the glory of immortalizing the 
image which she had discovered as soon as or 
earlier than he, a large share of admiration 
must be accorded. 

Besides Dorothy, the only person by whom 
Wordsworth admitted himself to have been 
deeply influenced was Coleridge. The intimacy 



which began between these two men while both 
were in their early twenties was as opportune 
as it was beneficial. It was Coleridge who 
provided, or rather assisted, Wordsworth to find 
the only thing still needful to make him the 
poet he finally became, namely, a philosophy. 
Soon the two young men felt that each was 
necessary to the other, and they established 
residences within easy walking distance, for the 
sake of daily intercourse. The story from this 
on is more familiar, yet some fresh insight is to 
be gathered even here. Coleridge, in his Bio- 
graphia Literaria, has already made us famil- 
iar with the principal incidents which led 
to their attempts and failures at collaboration. 
M. Legouis shows that notwithstanding their 
utter inability to work with each other, each 
worked best/or the other, or rather each felt the 
spur and stimulus of the other's mind with such 
force that the effect was of the happiest on both 
natures. Wordsworth's realism asserted itself 
through being brought into conflict with Cole- 
ridge's preference for the fantastic. The impos- 
sibility of keeping step with Coleridge, and the 
discomfort of feeling his natural progress 
thwarted, were to Wordsworth a decisive and 
imperious revelation of the inevitable tendency 
of his own poetic genius. Henceforth his pecu- 
liar province should be the common. Wherever 
selection was possible, he held it his duty to 
borrow nothing from those elements of the 
world which are marvellous and unusual. But 
when he has thus thrown to the winds all the 
customary auxiliary resources of poetry, what 
was left to prove his claim to the title of poet? 
There remained a powerful imagination directed 
upon common objects and upon the simple in- 
cidents of life. His imagination sees accu- 
rately, but because its vision is powerful it sees 
what has never been seen, or sees better and 
more clearly the objects which are displayed 
before the gaze of all men. It is indeed an 
illumination from the soul, 

" the gleam, 

The light that never was on sea or land, 
The consecration, and the Poet's dream."

MARRIAGE CUSTOMS IN MANY LANDS.* 



The care which many of us use when some fav- 
ored friends of ours become engaged to marry, 
in offering our best wishes to the woman and 
in congratulating the man, is interesting. But 
it is something more. It is significant of the 
time when the woman was not won as she is 
to-day, but was the booty of a successful foray 
or the gift of the father and owner. 

This custom of our day is good enough, and 
we would not change it ; but if we think of it 
a moment we shall see that we congratulate the 
man because he is supposed to have been 
striving for a prize which he has at last won, 
and our best wishes to the woman mean sim- 
ply that we hope she may be happy. One who 
leans a little toward cynicism is sometimes 
inclined to reverse this social formula, on the 
ground that the woman is really the more for- 
tunate of the two, and that it is the man for 
whose happiness we should be hoping. 

Whatever be the facts so far as present con- 
ditions are concerned, there was once a time 
to which this courtesy of ours points when 
there would have been in it a genuine literal- 
ness which it lacks to-day. When a young 
man, having decided that he must have a wife, 
gathered a few^ of his friends about him, set 
out for some neighboring tribe, seized and 
brought home the most attractive woman whom 
he could find, he might well be congratulated. 
He had won a prize. With quite as genuine 
a feeling could one offer the maiden his best 
wishes that she might be happy if it could so be. 

This rude method of securing a wife was 
somewhat improved when a man came to apply 
to the parents or to the father of a girl whom 
he wanted. The proprietorship of the father 
was recognized, so it was his consent that 
needed to be gained rather than that of the girl 
herself. But as truly again had the prize been 
won, and with a deeper feeling of sympathy 
than before might one hope for the happiness 
of her who had been literally given away. We 
need not look far back of us in time, nor to 
very distant parts of the world, to see this cus- 
tom still alive. We, it may be, have wandered 
farther from these old-time ideas than have 
many peoples, retaining ourselves traces of 
them only traces which have become almost 
mere forms. 

If we were able to know the marriage cus- 

*MABBIAGE CUSTOMS IK MANY LANDS. By the Rev. 
H. N. Hutchinson, B.A., F.Q.S. New York : D. Appleton 
&Co. 



toms in all lands, we should find everywhere 
old practices still surviving, or at least exist- 
ing in rudimentary forms, but all pointing 
back to a time when the beliefs of the people 
made necessary these practices either to ward 
off evil spirits or to secure good fortune and 
abundance to the young man and his bride. In 
Germany still the bride stands close to the 
groom during the service, " that there may be 
no room for the Prince of Darkness to come 
between them." 

Mr. Hutchinson, the author of " Marriage 
Customs in Many Lands," has brought together 
from many sources descriptions of a great va- 
riety of marriage customs. His object is " not 
to discuss scientific questions connected with 
the origin of marriage and the human family," 
but " to present to general readers a careful 
account of quaint and interesting customs, 
derived from information scattered through 
innumerable volumes." The value and interest 
of the book certainly would be much increased 
if we could learn from it not merely what vari- 
ous marriage customs people have, but why 
they have them. It is perhaps too much to 
expect in a single volume, and we can hardly 
complain since it was not the author's purpose 
to explain but only to relate. 

Attention is mainly given to those countries 
with which we are least familiar and where old 
and curious customs remain most tenaciously. 
Southern Germany, Bohemia, and Tyrol are 
full of survivals of old-time customs, the mean- 
ing of many of which is forgotten ; while 
China is illustrative of a people among whom 
an elaborate ceremonial in connection with mar- 
riage retains in large part its original signifi- 
cance. The barbarous peoples of Africa, of 
America, and of the Islands of the South Pa- 
cific, furnish curious customs similar in many 
cases to those of more advanced people. 

If in reading Mr. Hutchinson's book one is 
able to bear in mind the customs found in dif- 
ferent countries, he is struck with the frequent 
recurrence of certain practices. We are not 
ourselves very familiar with marriages or be- 
trothals arranged by parents or friends, but we 
notice among peoples as widely separated as are 
Chinese, Turks, Basutos of Africa, Samoans, 
Scandinavians, and Magyars, the go-between 
is an important person. With some the duties 
of the matchmakers are merely formal ; with 
others, they really bring about the marriage. 
But even when the duty is a formal one it is 
without doubt a relic of the time when the 
father owned the daughter and disposed of her 



182 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



on the best terms possible. Look where we 
may, the world over, we find these traces of 
former customs. Our own custom of giving 
away the bride is a direct descendant of the 
practice of the father or other male rela- 
tive giving away the women of the family as 
wives. 

It is well worth while to read a book in 
which one finds so many old customs described. 
And when we are amused by the curious, and, 
as they seem to us, foolish beliefs of many 
peoples, we shall do well to bear in mind that 
we ourselves have not as yet outgrown the age 
of superstition. Many of our prettiest customs 
are but survivals from a superstitious past, de- 
serving, however, to be retained for their pic- 
turesqueness. Yet there is no doubt that to 
many they are of real importance, though not 
understood. 

We may hope that in marriage, as in other 
matters, we may in time outlive our belief in 
signs and wonders, that we may feel a marriage 
is complete if no rice is scattered about, even 
though for picturesque effect we continue to 
throw the rice and the old shoe. 

A word may be added with regard to the 
general appearance of the book. It is very 
attractive ; the illustrations reproduced from 
photographs and paintings are unusually good.

WORLDS NOT REALIZED.* 



Until the publication of "Le Tresor des 
Humbles," M. Maeterlinck was known to the 
reading public as a philosophic man of letters. 
Every serious author is more or less philo- 
sophic : he has something to say of the general 
principles of life ; he can hardly avoid having 
some kind of philosophy, although he may 
make no effort to state it systematically or even 
directly. M. Maeterlinck has now, however, 
become a literary philosopher ; and in his latest 
book he sketches for us the outlines of his theory 
of the universe. It is not remarkable that M. 
Maeterlinck should have a philosophy : the re- 
markable thing is that he should try to express 
it, for it had been previously understood that 
the main characteristics of the deep truths 
which his work has heretofore embodied were 
such that nobody could give them utterance.

A. B. Walkley. New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



But, indeed, this last principle is the basis of 
the present formulation. 

In " The Treasure of the Humble," then, 
we have M. Maeterlinck as a philosopher ; not 
a very systematic philosopher, it is true, not 
academic, arid, accurate, but still a philosopher 
for all that. There will be many who have been 
interested in his plays who will like to turn to 
them again with these more definite statements 
in mind, and see how far they can discern, in 
what was enigmatic, the forms more or less 
vague which are a little more plainly drawn in 
this book. Such readers will turn at once to 
the essay on " The Tragical in Daily Life," 
where they will certainly find some things of a 
good deal of interest concerning the manner 
and the matter of " The Princess Maleine " and 
the other remarkable dramas. We prefer, how- 
ever, to consider the book by itself for the mo- 
ment, or, rather, for itself. It offers us coun- 
sel on life and not on literature, and we prefer 
to take it as it offers itself. M. Maeterlinck 
is a philosopher of a known school, and his work 
has a place in a known tendency of our time. 
Let us see, if we can, what he adds to what has 
been already common property. 

When we speak of M. Maeterlinck as a phil- 
osopher of " a known school " we mean that he 
is a mystic. That is a very vague name, and 
comprehends people as far apart as Plotinus 
and George Fox. Mystics are really not much 
farther known than as they are known to be 
mystics. Still the word gives us, in a way, 
some idea of a standpoint : it means, for in- 
stance, that one proceeds by intuition rather 
than by the reasoning powers. As a nineteenth 
century mystic, M. Maeterlinck will be con- 
nected in our minds with a movement of some 
interest in contemporary France. He is not a 
Neo-Christian, as the term is or was, but in so 
far as his thinking comes from Carlyle and 
Emerson he partakes of the thought that has 
influenced the Neo-Christians. Being a Bel- 
gian, however, it is not remarkable that there 
should also reappear in him the German strain, 
somewhat diversely apparent in Eckhard, 
Boehme, and Novalis. 

All this is a very tame way of dealing with 
a great genius, of course ; but, tame or not, we 
see no other way so simple or so efficacious of 
giving the general idea of M. Maeterlinck's 
philosophy. Set him down as a mystic, and 
you know something of him. He deals with 
the secret of Life ; he deals with matters not 
apprehended by the ordinary senses or the 
intellect ; he endeavors to see through the hith-

erto barrier of ordinarily-accepted human pow- 
ers. He is looking along " the wall of life in 
search of the crevices through which God (and, 
let us add, Man) may be seen." 

It is possibly foolish to attempt to give any 
account of the ideas of one who begins his work 
by declaring (entirely in earnest) that " It is 
idle to think that, by means of words, any real 
communication can ever pass from one man to 
another." Certainly it is not an encouraging 
beginning ; we cannot understand M. Maeter- 
linck without refuting him, for this point is 
cardinal. But the reader must pass over the 
dilemma ; without accepting the paradox he 
cannot even begin. Indeed, he will perhaps 
remember that the great moments of life are 
silent moments. Here M. Maeterlinck, very 
scientifically and unmystically, makes his start. 
Mystic though he be, he begins with a defi- 
nite fact which anyone may verify. There 
are certain moments in the life of everyone 
which are different from all other moments, in 
which life stands still and is eternal, while or- 
dinary existence runs through sixty, seventy, 
or six hundred seconds of time. Such moments 
people experience in different ways : some in 
love, some in sport, some in religion, some in 
work ; but all have them. People explain them 
in different ways, or else they do not explain 
them at all, or perhaps they do not even wholly 
appreciate that they have them. Such moments 
have conventionalized themselves in literature 
as the period of " thoughts too deep for words." 
For these moments are certainly moments of 
silence : but it is in them, proceeds M. Maeter- 
linck, in them only that we know. In such 
moments we are conscious of our brethren ; * 
then there is an instinct of truth in us : then 
existence lies bare. When do we know such 
moments ? " At a home-coming, on the eve of 
a departure, in the midst of a great joy, at the 
pillow of a death-bed, on the approach of a dire 
misfortune," although it may be at no such 
crisis ; it may be at any time. 

Now, of such moments some people have more 
and some less ; some seem to have a great many. 
Three or four years ago, writing of Mr. Sharp 
and M. Maeterlinck, we spoke of their subjects 
as being " indefinite hopes and fears, imagin- 
ings of spiritual accompaniment, premonitions 
almost occult, faint ripplings of emotion, the 
little wavelets that skim over the waves of pas- 
sion." But in saying so much and no more, we 
failed to penetrate entirely the idea of M. Mae- 

* Here, as often in what follows, I use a phrase or a word 
of M. Maeterlinck's without quotation marks. 



terlinck, if not of Mr. Sharp.* For now it is 
clear that it is as the awakening of the soul 
that M. Maeterlinck regards these questions 
" of a presentiment, of the strange impression 
produced by a chance meeting or a look, . . . 
of the secret laws of sympathy and antipathy, 
of elective and instinctive affinities, of the over- 
whelming influence of the thing that had not 
been spoken." In these silent moments of life, 
our souls may know each other ; and for many 
reasons M. Maeterlinck believes that our souls 
know each other more now in our daily life than 
in other ages. There have been such periods 
in history before, Egypt, India, the centuries 
of Mediaeval Mysticism ; there have also been 
periods in which souls were shut away from 
each other. Such was the case in the eigh- 
teenth century ; but now these great silent mo- 
ments are moments of more interest. 

On this theory is the book based. In certain 
great silent moments of life do we know the 
souls about us, do we become aware of fate, do 
we realize God. The essays are hardly consecu- 
tive : they depend on the first and the second, 
and have a certain connection with each other, 
but they do not make an interdependent system. 
M. Maeterlinck has noted a change in our ideas 
of morality. There are moments when we feel, 
more deeply than did our fathers, that we are 
not in the presence of ourselves alone, and in 
such moments our conscience judges without 
much influence from " conventional " morality. 
In such moments do " the gods from whom we 
spring " manifest themselves in an invisible 
goodness which, more than anything else, brings 
our soul into contact with other souls. The 
true working of life, the true fate, does not lie 
open ; it is hidden from most of us. Some per- 
ceive it more than others, most of all, those 
few whom the gods love and have destined to 
early death : more than men, women, who have 
preserved the sense of the mystic in the earth 
to this day. 

Such is the merest hint at M. Maeterlinck's 
theory of Life : it can be seen to be a very inter- 
esting one. We have not here a mysticism like 
that of Eckhard, who strove to express the 
relation of God with any individual soul ; or 
even like that of Ruysbroeck, who sought to 
indicate a way by which the soul could return 
to the divine from which it had sprung. We 
have here a very practical matter, not handled 

Somewhat more happy, perhaps, were we in speaking of 
M. Maeterlinck as one of the " antennae." He uses the same 
figure himself in speaking of Novalis, " nn de ces etres extra- 
ordinaires qni sont les antennes de Tame humaine."

THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



in a very practical way to be sure, but still a 
matter not for saints alone but for anyone and 
for all. Everybody can recognize the moments 
when he becomes conscious of the true life, and 
everybody can increase his power of appreciat- 
ing such moments. "This much at least is 
abundantly proved to us, that in the work-a- 
day lives of the very humblest of men, spiritual 
phenomena manifest themselves, mysterious 
direct workings, that bring soul nearer to soul." 
It is this possibility of true life that M. Mae- 
terlinck thinks of as " The Treasure," and it is 
more common in such lives as lack the ordi- 
nary circumstance of this world, namely "The 
Humble." 

We have spent so much time in trying to 
express M. Maeterlinck's views that we have no 
room left for criticism. But criticism of such a 
theory of life is hardly a matter for a period- 
ical devoted to current literature. It will come 
in time, and in a different way. It is a pity, 
however, that we cannot indicate the aesthetic 
bearing of M. Maeterlinck's philosophy : that 
we cannot point out the way in which this theory 
of " the moment " is developed in application 
to the drama, and indicate some further appli- 
cations. But such matters must be passed by. 

The English version of this book is a good 
one. Despite some small inaccuracies and 
inelegancies, it is rather remarkable in convey- 
ing the meaning and the character of the orig- 
inal. We rather regret the omission of the 
essays on Emerson, Kuysbroeck, and Novalis. 
They do not really belong to the others 
(although they are included in the French edi- 
tion), but they are very useful in an effort to 
understand our author. Mr. Walkley's Intro- 
duction seems to us good : not by any means 
the last word of comment, but still such as to 
give the reader who turns to it after he has 
read the book a good deal of help in accom- 
modating new ideas to old ones. 

It is a curious book, written in a charming 
style, and persuasive. One feels somehow as 
though M. Maeterlinck had almost a right to 
answer anyone who cannot see anything in it 
with the repartee of Turner, namely, Do n't 
you wish you could ?

SOME RECENT FOREIGN FICTION.* 



Foreign fiction is represented in the recent pro- 
duct by a number of books, among which six at 
least must have a few words of praise or dispraise, 
as the case may be. Nothing but praise, surely, is 
the desert of the stout volume which contains a half 
score of tales and sketches by Mr. Sienkiewicz, 
translated, like the author's other books, by the 
increasingly skilful hand of Mr. Curtin. The au- 
thor of the great Polish trilogy has now obtained 
such a vogue that whatever may bear his name is 
sure of an audience, and we are no longer called 
upon to do the missionary work that it gave us so 
much pleasure to do a few years ago. Two small 
volumes of short pieces by this writer have for some 
time been familiar to English readers, and seemed 
to give slight earnest of his tremendous powers when 
working with sufficient elbow-room. Taken by them- 
selves, those two volumes gave indications of little 
more than a graceful talent. The new volume, en- 
titled "Hania" from its longest story, is of a dif- 
ferent quality, and seems to us quite worthy of the 
genius which we know the author to possess. It is, 
to be sure, very uneven, and several of the sketches 
attain nothing more than mediocrity, but the others 
touch a very high watermark indeed, and exhibit 
much the same combination of raciness, vitality, and 
artistic restraint that makes the minor writings of 
Tourgue'nieff supreme in their kind. " Hania," 
" Tartar Captivity," and " Charcoal Sketches " are 
certainly masterpieces in miniature, and not un- 
worthy of comparison with " First Love " and the 
" Annals of a Sportsman." Some of the other pieces 
are of comparatively slight value, and two or three of 
them are no more than chalk drawings for the great 
canvasses by which the author is chiefly known. 

Why Dr. Max Nordau should have thought him- 
self capable of writing a novel, is a dark mystery. 
As an illustration of his own hobby of " Degenera- 
tion," such a production as "The Drones Must 
Die " may have a possible warrant for existence, 
but we can conceive of no other. The book has 
neither wit nor penetration nor shrewd observa- 
tion nor strength of any sort. Its movement is 
truly elephantine, and its invention is limited to the 
well-worn story of the poor man who seeks to en- 
rich himself by speculation and finds himself caught 
in the net of the spider. One might imagine an

effective treatment of la haute finance ; Balzac ac- 
complished it, and Zola has the power to do it again, 
but Dr. Nordau is too pitifully equipped for this or 
any other novelistic enterprise to be deserving of 
the slightest attention. 

The ponderous romance entitled "Andronike," 
which Professor Grosvenor has translated from the 
modern Greek of Mr. Stephanos Theodores Xenos, 
is a chronicle history of the Greek revolution of 
1821, and covers the happenings of the three event- 
ful years that ended with the sea-fight at Navarino. 
It proves to be more interesting as history than as 
romance, for the author is too minute and pains- 
taking in his endeavor to record the facts to make 
a successful novelist, and the work on the artistic 
side is at once nawe and crude. Yet there are thrill- 
ing episodes, described in a spirit of exalted patri- 
otism, which have power to stir the blood and to 
reproduce the emotional tumult that was translated 
by Shelley into the pure poetry of " Hellas." Many 
unfamiliar incidents are woven into the web of the 
romance, besides those things long familiar to all 
English readers the devotion and death of Byron, 
the adventures of Trelawney and Odysseus, the 
heroism of Marco Botsaris, the defense and fall of 
Misolonghi, the sinister careers of All and Ibrahim. 
The book is at least good history, and so embodies 
the spirit of modern Hellenic nationalism that we 
can easily understand the high esteem in which it 
is held by the people of whose contemporary liter- 
ature it is said to be " the greatest romance." 

The picturesque figure of AH Pasha is one of the 
most interesting in the Greek novelists' gallery of 
historical portraits, and the desperate villany of his 
career long ago inspired the foremost among Hun- 
garian writers of fiction to weave a romance about 
" the Liou of Janina." This romance, translated 
into English by Mr. Nisbet Bain, has just been pub- 
lished, and serves once more to illustrate the orien- 
tal imagination and the artistic irresponsibility of its 
prolific author. The story is moulded about a skele- 
ton of historical fact, but has in reality no more hold 
upon life than an Arabian tale. One cannot help 
being attracted by the invention and the glitter of 
such books, but it is not easy to take them as serious 
examples of modern fiction. 

The publication of M. Zola's " Paris," complet- 
ing the trilogy of "Les Trois Villes," is not only an 
event in the literary sense, but derives much adven- 
titious importance from the author's recent cham- 
pionship of a cause unpopular with his fellow-coun- 
trymen. However his part in that unfortunate af- 
fair may have aroused the animosity of social and 
official France, there is no doubt that it has com- 
pelled the admiration of the disinterested public out- 
side, and that he has won for himself a new and en- 
thusiastic following among lovers of justice and fair 
play everywhere, whether given to the reading of 
books or not. If not, many of them will make an 
exception in favor of a novel published at just this 
time by M. Zola, and the fortunes of the book are 
assured, as far as the general European and Ameri- 



can public is concerned. Report comes from Paris 
that the hatred of this writer is so widespread as to 
lessen the probable sale of the new novel. But we 
doubt if human nature in Paris is so unlike what it 
is elsewhere as to have this effect. Even those who 
dislike the author the most will have a natural curi- 
osity to become acquainted with his final deliberate 
verdict upon the civilization which he has so taken 
to task in his defense of Captain Dreyfus. That ver- 
dict is embodied in the earnest and passionate pages 
of "Paris," and must be reckoned with as the pro- 
nouncement of one of the most acute and vigorous 
intellects of the time. It is a many-hued picture 
with which the book presents us, a canvas with strong 
effects of chiaroscuro and lurid coloring, with start- 
ling contrasts between the base and the heroic, be- 
tween social shams and social realities, between the 
heartless indifference of the wealthy and the des- 
perate frenzy of the proletariat. There is much bit- 
terness of feeling in the criticism of the existing or- 
der, and a note of fine indignation rings through 
the whole work. Yet the purport is not pessimism, 
although many will no doubt dismiss the book with 
that easy epithet; it is rather the impatient and 
passionate idealism of the clear-sighted philosophi- 
cal observer, who says to society "thou ailest here 
and here," and does not shrink from laying bare the 
plague-spots of the present, knowing that by such 
service the permanent interests of society are best 
to be furthered. No, M. Zola is as distinctly an 
idealist as is Dr. Ibsen ; to charge such men with 
pessimism is to display ignorance of the very mean- 
ing of that term. We wish it might be said that the 
art of M. Zola was commensurate with his idealism. 
But the fact is indisputable that most of the literary 
graces are denied him ; there is in the best of his 
work little animation or brilliancy, little of the light- 
ness of touch to which art owes most of its effects, 
little of the calm that is so much more persuasive 
than the most turbulent display of emotion. " Paris " 
is not as dull as "Lourdes," or even as "Rome," 
but it is nevertheless dull, except in episodes, and 
much conscientiousness is needed to read it without 
omission. The intellectual evolution of the Abbe 
Froment is the thread which unites the three sec- 
tions of the trilogy, and in the end we leave him, en- 
nobled and strengthened by much suffering, brought 
to full acknowledgment of the claims of the intel- 
lect, and prepared to substitute a rational theory of 
conduct for the incoherent fabric, now hopelessly 
shattered, of his long cherished illusions. The in- 
troduction of his brother Guillaume, a chemist who 
has invented a new explosive of extraordinary 
power, makes it possible for the author to give to 
anarchism of the bomb-throwing type a conspicu- 
ous place in this " Paris " section of the work, and 
the destruction, planned but not executed, of a great 
basilica, is one of the most exciting episodes to 
which our attention is directed. In this book we 
doubtless have the final word of M. Zola's philoso- 
phy and of M. Zola's art. And the fundamental 
questions raised by his total activity are these two : 



186 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



Is the philosophy that toward which the currents of 
enlightened thought are irresistibly flowing ? Is 
the art of such a nature that to the future observer, 
looking back upon our epoch, the books that bear 
the name of Zola will appear as the books of Bal- 
zac now appear to us, as the lasting embodiment of 
the life and thought of their age ? To the first ques- 
tion we may with some degree of confidence make 
an affirmative answer, but to the second the reply 
must be in the negative. The future historian of 
literature will not be able to neglect the immense 
work of M. Zola, but will be constrained to deal 
with it as we now deal with the work of Voltaire. 
In other words, it will be dealt with not as a per- 
manent possession of literary art, but as a literary 
force for the most part spent in the period that 
was responsible for its generation. 

M. Pierre de Coulevain's "American Nobility " is 
a novel that we have read with great interest, and 
if we cannot give it our unqualified approval we can 
at least pay tribute to its skilful construction and its 
obvious sincerity of purpose. It is, briefly, the story 
of a French gentleman of distinguished ancestry, 
who, finding the family fortunes impaired almost to 
the point of destitution, seeks to restore them by 
marriage with an American heiress. The marriage 
is duly brought about, and the wedded pair are 
happy for a time ; but the inevitable intrigue pres- 
ently makes its appearance, and shatters the dream 
of the confiding wife. After a period of great emo- 
tional stress for all concerned, the other woman dies, 
practically by her own act, leaving husband and 
wife to patch up a sort of reconciliation, and try to 
save from the wreck of their happiness enough to 
make their continued existence tolerable if nothing 
more. This plot is so hackneyed that its bare state- 
ment seems to put the book in the list of common- 
place and insignificant fictions ; but the author has 
acted from a serious artistic motive, to which credit 
must be given. His book is to a considerable ex- 
tent the embodiment of a thesis, to the effect that 
such marriages as he describes must inevitably fail 
to result happily, since there are spiritual depths in 
the soul of a Frenchman which no Anglo-Saxon 
woman can sound, spiritual needs in his nature 
which only women of Latin race and Catholic train- 
ing can satisfy. There is thus found a sort of justi- 
fication for the conduct of the hero, who is by no 
means represented as a vulgar libertine, and who 
clearly enjoys all the time the qualified respect and 
the entire sympathy of the writer. Let those who 
will call such a book immoral in its tendency ; we 
rather prefer to take from it the lesson of the essen- 
tial incompatability of temperament existing be- 
tween the two races, and are willing at the same 
time to concede that the author has told the story 
with perfect honesty from his own point of view, 
that he has done his best to be fair to the Anglo- 
Saxon character, and that the fatal defect of his 
argument proceeds from a limitation of sympathetic 
insight -of which he himself is absolutely and bliss- 
fully unconscious. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL.* 

Mark Twain's recent account of his around-the- 
world lecture tour, which he entitles " Following the 
Equator," is a first-rate specimen of that eminently 
sagacious mixture of sense and nonsense which is so 
characteristic of him. To many refined people he 
may seem the vulgar buffoon, entirely unrespectful, 
unconventional, irreverent ; but this aspect is but his 
surface aspect. He reverences what is essentially 
worthy of reverence, as is evident from many a page 
in this volume. His remarks on reverence, indeed, 
show eminent sense and insight, as when he says : 

" The reverence which is difficult, and which has per- 
sonal merit in it, is the respect which you pay, without 
compulsion, to the political or religious attitude of a 
man whose beliefs are not yours. You cannot revere 
his gods or his politics, and no one expects you to do 
that, but you could respect his belief in them if you tried 
hard enough, and you could respect him, too, if you 
tried hard enough. But it is very difficult; it is next 
to impossible, and so we hardly e-ver try. If the man 
does n't believe as we do, we say he is a crank, and that 
settles it. I mean it does nowadays, because we can 't 
burn him." 

In truth, the dominant note in this book is not jest 
but earnestness, moral and humane, an earnest 
desire for sincerity and genuineness, but tearing 
sham to pieces and flinging it to the winds. If 
Mr. Clemens had not been Mark Twain, he might 
have been Carlyle. 

But we have not space for exemplifying fully 
either the wisdom or the wit in this book. However, 
we mention the common Hindoo impression of the 
United States, as Mark Twain gives expression to 
it. When this country is named to the average 
Hindoo, 

" Two torches flare up in the dark caverns of his mind, 
and he says, ' Ah, the country of the great man Wash- 
ington; and the Holy City Chicago.' For he knows 
about the Congress of Religions, and this has enabled 
him to get an erroneous impression of Chicago." 

Mark Twain's manner of writing is deliciously

desultory ; yon never know on what continent the 
next page will land you. Altogether, we have a 
most brilliant and varied jumble of wit, humor, 
information, instruction, wisdom, poetry, irony, and 
jest. Mark Twain is continually stepping from the 
sublime to the ridiculous, and vice versa. As soon 
as he suspects he is getting eloquent, he at once 
jumps into outrageous farce. As Mark warns off 
the reviewer who shall attack him for padding, we 
will only say that his skill and brilliancy can almost 
redeem the plentiful padding in this book. As a 
book of travel, this work stands very high by reason 
of its incisiveness and vividness ; and the inveterate 
travel-reader will mark the day he fell in with it 
with red-letter. Altogether, we find here that rara 
avis, a real book, full of thoroughly original char- 
acteristic impressions characteristically expressed, 
and thus intensely enjoyable to the real reader. 

Mr. W. A. Paton's " Picturesque Sicily " is a 
general and popular account of scenery, antiquities, 
and modern life, in that sunny isle. In the course 
of a three months' sojourn he visited the principal 
cities Palermo, Catania, Messina, and Syracuse ; 
and also Segesta, Selinus, Girgenti, and other 
places of antiquarian interest, all of which are de- 
scribed in an enthusiastic and pleasant vein. He is 
surprised at finding in Sicily more ruins of Greek 
temples than in all Greece, and he gives large space 
to his observations on these ruins. The Sicily of 
to-day he finds to be in the main poverty-stricken 
and beggar-ridden. He is harried from the most 
charming views by crowds of loathsome beggars. 
The Middle Ages still linger in Sicily, as is shown 
by the prevalence of saint-worship and superstition, 
and the lawlessness of secret associations like the 
Mafia. At Cefalu he happens on a true descend- 
ant of the mediaeval minstrel who recited from the 
" Chronicles of the Crusaders." 

" Daring his recitations he stood as if wrapped in 
thought, bareheaded, forgetful of the weather, and, 
seemingly, of our presence. The performance was not 
a mere repetition of lines by rote, for, although there 
was very little variation in accent or tone, he seemed to 
speak as if his mind was fixed on the ideas he was ex- 
pressing. The tale of the Crusade finished, we gave 
him whatever it may have been, and again requested 
our guide to ask him to recite other numbers of his 
repertoire. Informing us that he would give us the 
story of the ' Landing of Ruggiero and the building of 
the Cathedral at Cefalu,' he began in a louder and more 
inspiring tone, and repeated the lines more vigorously 
and with finer expression, using certain modest gestures. 
The tale of King Roger was longer than either of the 
other two recitations, and, when he finished it, the old 
man, pointing eagerly in the direction of the town, told 
our guide to say to the strangers that ' There, there, 
was the very city King Ruggiero had visited, there the 
cathedral he had built in honor of the Christ.' How 
were the mighty fallen ! From the shoulders of the 
disciples of Ciullio d'Alcamo, the favorites of the kings, 
the pets of fortune, the mantle of minstrelsy had fallen 
on the bowed shoulders of this starved and woe-begone 
old man whom we found on a bitter Sicilian winter day 
cowering under the ruins of an ancient Norman keep." 



Books on Sicily are indeed few, but when Mr. 
Paton says that " the Norman conquest of Sicily 
has not found its historian," he forgets Gaily 
Knight's and Bazancourt's books on this subject. 
The author's views are of the impressionist type, 
and there is much second-hand material. As a whole, 
the work is diffuse and journalistic. But while it 
has not the vital inevitable quality of a book of the 
first class, it will be found in general readable and 
useful. The appendices are of particular value, but 
the book has neither map nor index. The illustra- 
tions, though often interesting, are hackneyed in 
subject, and sometimes poorly done. 

" Going to War in Greece," by Mr. Frederick 
Palmer, is a New York reporter's account of the 
recent one-sided little fray a month from start to 
finish between those two ancient enemies, Greek 
and Turk. Most of the book is taken up with the 
looking and waiting for the war to begin ; and of the 
actual war there is little description of operations. 
The childish unmilitary character of the Greek 
" Army of the Cafe" " is brought out in so strong a 
light that we suspect caricature. The book is writ- 
ten in jaunty style, and contains numerous rather 
indifferent illustrations, but has no map. 

Commander R. H. Bacon's book with the strik- 
ing but not unjustifiable title, " Benin, the City of 
Blood," is a straightforward military account of the 
British expedition, in 1897, to Benin City, West 
Africa, to avenge the massacre of the English mis- 
sion. As a narrative of one of England's innum- 
erable little wars, and as throwing light on African 
savagery and bush - fighting, it has considerable 
interest. Benin was deserted at the approach of 
the British, and was found steeped in human blood, 
" smeared over bronzes, ivory, and even the walls." 
The evidence of crucifixions and human sacrifices 
was found everywhere. " Every person who was 
able, I should say, indulged in a human sacrifice, 
and left the remains in front of his house." Com- 
mander Bacon's account shows clearly that the most 
pernicious element in savagery is a cruel religion. 
The book contains also some interesting details on 
the method by which the British fought their way 
along the narrow paths in the dense forest. In ad- 
vancing along these paths where savages might lurk 
unseen within a few feet, " precautionary volleys " 
from rifles and Maxims were fired on all sides every 
few minutes. Sometimes rockets were used to intim- 
idate the natives. " The most weird feature of the 
whole fighting is the rarity with which the enemy is 
seen. Shots are fired, yells, whoops, and shouts are 
heard, men fall wounded and killed, yet not a sign 
of the enemy himself, except just the shiver of a 
moving bush and the half doubtful view of a dusky 
figure." The book is furnished with a rather inade- 
quate map and a few fair illustrations. 

Dr. J. H. Barrows's " A World Pilgrimage " is

Interior." Herein Dr. Barrows discourses, in his

vein of general optimism, of his doings and observ- 
ations on the usual world-trip, and everywhere he 
maintains a large, humane, and catholic view of 
things and men. While this is in no wise a very 
notable book, it is readable and suggestive. His 
lecture-tour naturally gives rise to more extended 
remarks on India than on other countries, and 
these ten chapters will have special interest for 
missionary circles. The illustrations are only pass- 
able. We regret to notice that the title-page is de- 
faced by a mangled quotation from Keats. 

Another cosmopolitan book of travels, but of a 
somewhat different order, is Mr. Richard Harding 
Davis's " A Year from a Reporter's Note-Book." 
It treats of war in Cuba and Greece, of glory in the 
Coronation of the Czar, of the Inauguration of Mc- 
Kinley, of the Queen's Jubilee, and the Millennial 
Celebration at Budapest. All these events are de- 
scribed in that clear, crisp, graphic style, and with 
that slight trace of cynicism, which we have been 
accustomed to expect from Mr. Davis. Perhaps 
the best of these " Notes " is that on the Coronation, 
wherein the author gives a quite vivid impression 
of the Czar-worship and the mediaevally deep, 
sombre, unthinking religiousness of the great mass 
of Russians. However, the most quotable page is 
in the Budapest article, a description of Berkes, the 
greatest of Hungarian violinists. 

" His violin seems to be just as much a part of him 
as are his arms or his eyes or his heart. When he plays, 
his body seems to stop at the neck, and he appears to 
draw all of his strength and feeling from the violin in 
his hands, the rest of him being merely a support for 
his head and instrument. He has curious eyes, like 
those of a Scotch collie sad, and melancholy, and 
pleading, and when he plays they grow glazed and 
drunken-looking, like those of an absinthe drinker, 
and tears roll from them to the point of his short beard 
and wet the wood of his violin. His music probably 
affects different people according to their nerves, but it 
is as moving as any great passage in any noble book, or 
in any great play, and while it lasts he holds people 
absolutely in a spell, so that when the music ceases 
women burst into tears, and I have seen men jump to 
their feet and empty the contents of their pockets into 
his lap; and they are so sure to do this that their ser- 
vants take their money away from them when they are 
dressing to dine at some house where Berkes is an- 
nounced to play. One night a Frenchman dipped a 
two-thousand-franc note into a glass of champagne and 
pasted it on the back of the man's violin, and the next day 
Berkes sent it back to him again, saying that to have 
this compliment paid him by a foreigner in the presence 
of his countrymen was worth more to him than the 
money." 

These brief reportorial sketches we feel to be too 
often over-done, too conscious, too blunt, and too 
lacking in real grace, beauty, and technique, to be 
literature of any high order ; yet they certainly have 
a value and interest, and a measure of real but 
mostly suggested power. 

" Afloat on the Ohio," by the well-known historical 
writer, Mr. R. G. Thwaites, is a pleasant though not 
especially interesting account of an uneventful canoe 



voyage down the Ohio to Cairo. In diary form it 
gives useful historical and descriptive notes on the 
places passed and people met, and in particular is 
valuable as throwing some light on the river-life of 
house-boats and fishermen ; but we feel at the end 
that we should choose some pleasanter, if less his- 
toric, stream than the Ohio for a canoe trip. The 
book contains two appendices, " Historical Outline 
of Ohio Valley Settlement " and " Selected list of 
Journals of Previous Travellers down the Ohio "; 
but it has no map. 

Mr. H. L. Willoughby's "Across the Everglades " 
is an account of a journey into that unknown part 
of Florida where the Seminoles were driven in the 
Indian War. " It may seem strange," our author 
remarks, " in our days of Arctic and African explor- 
ation, for the general public to learn that in our 
very midst, as it were, in one of our Atlantic coast 
states, we have a tract of land one hundred and 
thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as 
much unknown to the white man as the heart of 
Africa." We learn that the Everglades is not a 
dense swamp, as often supposed, but a vast grassy 
lake with water but a few inches deep, and oc- 
casional islets a few feet square. It is inhabited 
by Indians, deer, otter, snakes, and birds. Mr. 
Willoughby found that the saw grass was the 
great barrier to Everglade travel. " It pays better 
to go twenty-five miles around than half a mile 
through. What makes this grass so formidable and 
so much dreaded is the saw-like edge with which it 
is armed on three sides. If you get a blade between 
your hand and the pole, it will cut you to the bone, 
with a jagged gash that takes long to heal." Mr. 
Willoughby met with no remarkable adventures, 
but his story, though attaining little literary quality, 
is simply and directly told, and will be found espe- 
cially readable by all who find pleasure in outdoor 
life. The first half of the work is introductory, 
giving some account of previous expeditions into the 
Everglades, and of his preparation for his trip. He 
finds the real crocodile as well as the alligator and 
has some interesting remarks on this matter, though 
we must regard his long list of species as padding. 
The book has a serviceable map and illustrations, 
and as appendix a Seminole vocabulary. 

" Servia, the Poor Man's Paradise " is the attrac- 
tive title of an enthusiastic book on that little known 
country, by Herbert Vivian. Mr. Vivian, an ardent, 
High Church, conservative Englishmen, travelled 
for some months in Servia, and gives a glowing and 
attractive picture of this seldom visited Balkan 
province, which has only of late completely freed 
itself from the Turkish rule. He says : 

" I rejoice to have explored Servia before she is com- 
pletely given over to the exigencies of progress. Already 
she has lost very much of the Oriental glamour which 
travellers encountered even ten years ago, and ten years 
hence she may be fashioned entirely upon modern West- 
ern lines. The picturesque squalor of Turkish times is 
being rapidly expropriated by the ugliness of the useful. 
Still, I know no country which can offer so general an

impression of beauty, so decided an aroma of the Mid- 
dle Ages. The whole atmosphere is that of a thrilling 
romance. Conversation is larded with accounts of hair- 
breadth 'scapes and deeds of chivalry and all as if 
they were everyday occurrences, the most natural in the 
world. At each turn I met heroes who had performed 
prodigies against the hajdutsi, swashbucklers who had 
led irregulars against the Turks, popes who had smelt 
powder when fighting for the national cause at the head 
of their flocks." 

The style is spirited and good, though we think the 
oft-used " state-stroke " is rather clumsy for coup 
d'6tat. As a whole the book, though not particularly 
well-considered and thorough, is an interesting and 
useful sketch of Servia, past and present, in its polit- 
ical, ecclesiastical, and industrial aspects. The work 
is provided with a good map. 

Captain Younghusband in " South Africa of To- 
day " republishes letters and telegrams to the Lon- 
don " Times," whose special correspondent he was 
during the recent disturbances in the Transvaal. 
The author has studied the subject at first-hand and 
gives a fair, able, and interesting account of the cir- 
cumstances that led up to the Jameson Raid, and 
of the events immediately following. He regards 
the Transvaal as the richest section of South Africa, 
and destined to become the most populous. The 
Boer question certainly gives great solicitude to the 
English. Indeed, the enterprising, energetic En- 
glishman, continually running against a stone wall 
of stolid, crafty Dutchmen, is almost nonplussed and 
dismayed. While most of the book is given up to 
the Transvaal, there are also chapters on Rhodesia 
and Natal. Altogether, the volume, if not as compre- 
hensive and luminous as Mr. Bryce's recent account, 
is in many ways a closer study, and will repay care- 
ful reading. 

Mrs. Isabella Bird Bishop's "Korea and her 
Neighbors" is an up-to-date handbook on Korea, 
and contains also some information on neighboring 
Manchuria and Siberia. Mrs. Bishop familiarized 
herself with the country and people during an ex- 
tended residence at treaty ports and during two jour- 
neys to the interior. She found the Koreans under a 
most oppressive government, limp, lazy, dependent, 
poverty-stricken, but the Korean colonists in Siberia 
under Russian rule very thrifty and prosperous. 
One marked characteristic of Koreans is an am- 
bition to eat much and often. 

" They eat not to satisfy hunger, but to enjoy the sen- 
sation of repletion. The training for this enjoyment 
begins at a very early age, as I had several opportuni- 
ties of observing. A mother feeds her young child with 
rice, and when it can eat no more in an upright posi- 
tion, lays it on its back on her lap and feeds it again, 
tapping its stomach from time to time with a flat spoon 
to ascertain if further cramming is possible. The Ko- 
rean is omnivorous. Dog meat is in great request at 
certain seasons, and dogs are extensively bred for the 
table. Pork, beef, fish, raw, dried, and salted, the in- 
testines of animals, all birds and game, no part being 
rejected, are eaten a baked fowl, with its head and 
claws, and interior intact, being the equivalent of 'the 



fatted calf.' Cooking is not always essential. On the 
Han I saw men taking fish off the hook, and after plung- 
ing them into a pot of red pepper sauce, eating them at 
once with their bones." 

Mrs. Bishop writes with the air of the professional 
traveller, and in a business-like way conveys a vast 
amount of information clearly and impartially. She 
throws a side-light on the Chino- Japanese war, and 
is particularly full on the political and industrial 
aspects of the people at the present time. 

"This feeblest of independent kingdoms, rudely 
shaken out of her sleep of centuries, half frightened and 
wholly dazed, finds herself confronted with an array of 
powerful, ambitious, aggressive, and not always over- 
scrupulous powers, bent, it may be, on overreaching her 
and each other, forcing her into new paths, ringing with 
rude hands the knell of time-honored custom, clamoring 
for concessions, and bewildering her with reforms, sug- 
gestions, and panaceas, of which she sees neither the 
meaning nor the necessity." 

The illustrations, maps, and appendices add to the 
value of this book. HIBAM ^ STANIJ5T . 



A very candid 
irish traveller 
in America. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

American readers will not feel alto- 
gether flattered when they look in 
fo e m i rror held up to them by the 
Hon. Martin Morris, an intelligent Irish traveller, 
in his thoughtful little book of essays entitled 
"Transatlantic Traits" (Elliot Stock, London). 
Mr. Morris is of a reflective turn, and he gives gen- 
eral conclusions rather than raw impressions. He 
is by no means an ill-natured or on the whole un- 
friendly critic, but he is a very candid and dispas- 
sionate one, and he clearly has no notion of curry- 
ing favor with his cis-Atlantic readers by the cheap 
expedient of tickling their national vanity. On the 
other hand, it must be said that his book is quite 
free from the tone of patronizing jocularity which 
European travellers so often see fit to adopt towards 
this country. The author is altogether too sensible 
a man to affect to regard the United States of 
America as a huge joke, and he has evidently made 
a conscientious effort to comprehend us clearly and 
exhibit us fairly. Like most cultivated foreign trav- 
ellers, from De Tocqueville to Mr. Bryce, Mr. Mor- 
ris finds us on the whole somewhat commonplace, 
immensely energetic and capable in every calling 
which has for its supreme end the accumulation of 
money, but correspondingly lacking on the aesthetic 
and intellectual side. We accumulate vast fortunes, 
invent miraculous machines, conduct great business 
enterprises ; but we are seemingly incapable of add- 
ing to or even of duly appreciating the world's ar- 
tistic and intellectual treasures. In short, "America 
is the land of the hoipolloi with a vengeance. Noth- 
ing rises above the common level but some gigantic 
buildings and ' the Elevated ' in New York." Mr. 
Morris naturally thinks rather meanly of our art, and

[March 16, 



we fear his stay at Chicago was marred by a glimpse 
of the alleged statue of Columbus recently removed 
out of deference to a growing sentiment of public 
disapproval that threatened in time to lead to a pop- 
ular outbreak. European travellers as a rule, after 
having damned with faint praise the " evidences of 
our material prosperity " of which we are so justly 
proud, are apt to grow rhapsodic on the theme of 
American women. Not so Mr. Morris. Even here 
he is, as Mr. Arnold said of his French critic on 
Goethe, " candid and cool, perhaps a little cold." 
He grants the American woman a certain smatter- 
ing superiority in point of attainments over her 
busy dollar-getting husband ; but he finds her some- 
what shrill, noisy, lacking in feminine charm. He 
agrees with Mr. Henry James that " one feels her 
presence too much as a sound " a vox et prceterea 
nihil, we suppose, like Wordsworth's cuckoo, or the 
classic nightingale. It need not be inferred from 
our citations that Mr. Morris found here nothing 
to admire and praise. He has a good many kind 
and cordial words for us, which are the more grate- 
ful in that they are evidently sincere and well- 
weighed. He does not deal in what is known in 
popular parlance as " taffy," and he is one of those 
useful friends who tell us of our faults. There are 
three essays "At Sea," " On Traits in General," 
and " American Traits " together with a " Fore- 
word" and an "Aftword." Two of the papers 
were written originally for the " Nineteenth Cen- 
tury " and the " New Review," and they now ap- 
pear in a considerably enlarged form. 

A " confession," as the word is com- 
c*. monly used, is an avowal of matters 

somewhat prejudicial to one's char- 
acter and reputation. A collector, then, rightly 
uses the word "confession" for a statement of his 
deeds qud collector. We do not, however, consider 
Mr. Carew Hazlitt's " Confessions of a Collector " 
(Dodd) to be more than verbally prejudicial to the 
author's reputation. It is true that it is a literary, 
an artistic sin to love books as a collector loves them ; 
but there may be extenuating circumstances. Some 
men cannot help being drawn toward collecting. 
Mr. Hazlitt was one of these. He is, of course, by 
no means unknown to the general reader, and these 
bibliographical memoirs will be opened by many 
with a good deal of pleasant anticipation, which will 
not be in vain. We have been greatly pleased at 
them, recalling no other such book that is so good, 
always with a reservation in favor of Burton's 
" Bookhunter," which we have not read for years 
and so may prize too highly. Strictly speaking, 
however, Mr. Hazlitt was not a book-collector : that 
is to say, his chief dealing with books was not col- 
lecting for himself ; to use his own words, he was 
not a pure amateur but a commercial speculator in 
books. He began with the idea of a collection for 
himself, but later in life he was chiefly occupied as 
informal agent for others. The turning-point in 
his career was, we should say, when he sold Mr. 



Huth a little seventeenth-century tract for five shil- 
lings, and discovered that cheapness was no recom- 
mendation with that gentleman. After this discov- 
ery, Mr. Hazlitt assisted very largely in the increase 
and completion of the Huth Library, much to the 
benefit of all concerned. We regard a commercial 
speculator in books as a superior person to a book- 
collector. Mr. Hazlitt was destined by nature to 
have dealings in books : *his bibliographical knowl- 
edge and feeling made him a very exceptional 
purchasing-agent ; we will own to a feeling of respect 
for him at never becoming a mere book-collector. 
It must be confessed, however, that while his deal- 
ings with books were of a very proper character, he 
was unable to withstand the passion for collecting 
something. At one time he collected postage-stamps ; 
he speaks of the matter with some regret : " a new 
weakness," " a foolish passion," he rightly calls it. 
More seriously did he devote himself to the collec- 
tion of coins, and we think he makes out a fairly 
good case in favor of the coin- collector. And yet, 
curious at first, though on consideration natural, his 
very intelligent views on coin-collecting caused him 
to be regarded by the esoteric as a presumptuous 
layman. In fact, we cannot regard Mr. Hazlitt as 
a true collector. He was a student, an antiquarian, 
in letters and in other directions too, as everyone 
knows ; but we cannot think that he was a true col- 
lector. He had really too broad views, too wide 
interests, too keen feelings, to be satisfied with col- 
lecting. Indeed, had he been a collector in the strict 
sense of the word, he could hardly have written so 
entertaining a book as the present one. 

Mr. F. Anstey is already well known 
Mr. Jabberjee, B.A. in scholarly circles for his skill in 

logical development from a funda- 
mental hypothesis. He is a most successful follower 
of the great originator of formal logic, who held 
that fiction was more philosophical than history on 
account of its aiming at general rather than partic- 
ular truth. Minor matters of fact have no great 
import to the reason : hence the positive value to 
the human race of the thorough plausibilities of 
" Vice Versa " or " The Talking Horse." Mr. 
Anstey appears now, however, to have abandoned 
(temporarily we hope) the field of logic to exhibit 
his mastery in the domain of the linguist. " Baboo 
Hurry Bungsho Jabberjee, B.A." (Appleton) is a 
work of many excellences, but its chief value ap- 
pears to us to lie in its being written in the care- 
fully studied lingo of a " highly educated Indian 
university man " who has for some time lived in 
London. Even a person who has never seen one 
of the species can see that the language must be 
good. Mr. Jabberjee has learned something of the 
literary language at the university, and has learned 
much modern slang in London. He incorporates 
in his conversation all the incongruities possible to 
one who knows our inconsistent language but par- 
tially. His speech will repay the closest study, for 
every strand of the variegated thread is natural,

even necessary, to one under his circumstances. 
Columbus showed how easy it is to do a thing when 
you know how : many users of the English language 
will here learn how difficult a thing they do every 
day without knowing anything about it. This work 
will find a place beside the famous "English as 
She is Spoke." Useful, then, in a great degree to 
the linguistic student, the book will not be more 
wearisome than others of Mr. Anstey's books to the 
more general reader. Mr. Jabberjee is of the opin- 
ion (not unknown in this country) that the letter- 
press of " Punch " is not such as can be read with 
pleasure by a cultivated person. He offers his serv- 
ices to raise the general tone, and contributes ac- 
counts of his adventures. These are at first some- 
what disconnected, but as they proceed they knit 
into a narrative that finally comes to a great cli- 
max in the breach of promise suit of Mankletow i-s. 
Jabberjee. Mr. Anstey's labors are recommended 
and elucidated by the work of his illustrator, whose 
presentations of the learned barrister are most deli- 
cate suggestions of nationality and character. 

^ r> ^' Clark Russell contributes his 
mite to the now subsiding Nelson 
revival, in the shape of a volume of 
" Pictures from the Life of Nelson " (Dodd). The 
articles appeared originally in the " English Illus- 
trated Magazine," and the author has added to 
them, out of quantitative considerations mainly, as 
we judge, a lengthy and somewhat rambling preface, 
together with some twenty-six pages of remotely 
relevant supplementary matter touching Mr. Rus- 
sell's old grievance, the elimination of Englishmen 
from the merchant service and the consequent dry- 
ing up of the fount whence the Royal Navy has 
always drawn its seamen of the storied national and 
traditional type. The competition of the foreigner 
and what Mr. Russell evidently thinks the quasi- 
traitorous greed of the ship-owners are fast draining 
British forecastles of British sailors. The breed 
will become extinct; and then, Mr. Russell asks, 
what is going to become of the Navy ? Now, we are 
inclined to think that " cheapness " is not the sole 
ground on which the Dutchman, the Scandinavian, 
or even the " Dago " is preferred to the Englishman 
in English shipping offices. Besides being " cheaper," 
the foreigner is nine times out of ten thriftier, so- 
berer, trustier, and (above all) more tractable than 
his British competitor. Would Mr. Russell, in the 
light of his own experience in the Merchant Ser- 
vice, deny that? Mr. Russell babbles a good deal 
of the virtues of " poor Jack " his " characteristic 
simplicity," his " childlike nature," and so on. But 
how many " Jacks " of this legendary and conven- 
tional sort has Mr. Russell ever actually met in the 
flesh, afloat or ashore ? The hard fact is that " Jack," 
and especially British " Jack," is in general much 
what his calling naturally tends to make him, a 
pretty tough customer, who gives his. tutelary 
" cherub that sits up aloft " and " looks out " for 
him no end of unnecessary trouble in getting him

out of scrapes of his own making. Mr. Russell 
naturally looks to the legislature (everybody looks 
to the legislature for everything nowadays) to mend 
his grievance. He cites approvingly the old Navi- 
gation Laws, under which the shipping of foreign 
seamen in British ships was narrowly restricted; 
and seems to want something of the kind enacted 
now. Mr. Russell's Nelsonian pictures are graphic 
and spirited, and contrast favorably in this regard 
with Professor Laughton's recent rather tame, if 
accurate and severely critical, " Life." The bulk of 
the narrative is devoted to the famous sea fights ; 
but there are readable chapters on Nelson's boy- 
hood, his rather numerous erotic experiences, bis 
characteristics, etc. The exasperating Lady Hamil- 
ton episode is given no more than its due share of 
prominence. The book is neatly made and contains 
several full-page plates, portraits and battle-pieces, 
of excellent quality. 

The recollection of earlier essays led 
us to turn to Mr. F. P. Stearns's 
"Modern English Prose Writers" 
(Putnam) with pleasant anticipation. There is op- 
portunity for a good book on this subject, and we 
hoped to get it. We regret to say that we are much 
disappointed. The essays composing the book are 
written in a supercilious tone on superficial knowl- 
edge, and that is a pretty bad combination. If Mr. 
Stearns knew his subject thoroughly one need not 
mind his manner, or if he wrote less ex cathedra 
one would not mind a few errors. As it is, however, 
one cannot help noticing both. We do not know 
which are the most foolish, his brutal and untrue 
remark that Ruskin's father " fortunately died in 
time to give his more gifted son an opportunity for 
the work he was destined by temperament and 
inclination to perform," his idea that " Modern 
Painters " was written at a " tender age," his igno- 
rance that " Aratra Pentelici " was one of Ruskin's 
Oxford lecture courses ; or his fancies that Arthur 
in " a book . . . called ' Schooldays at Rugby ' ' 
represented Matthew Arnold, that Arnold was Pro- 
fessor of Poetry for nearly twenty years, laboring 
all the time throughout " the whole academic year," 
that " very few of the external facts of Matthew 
Arnold's life have been made public "; or his opin- 
ions that all European languages are the progeny of 
the parent Indo-European, that Max Midler is the 
most distinguished scholar living, and that " the 
grand results of comparative philology " were " de- 
termined by Oriental Societies." A few minor 
errors like these do not necessarily amount to much. 
But we read this book till we had endured thirty or 
forty of them, and, as in that time we had not come 
upon any criticism of value, we then gave it up. It 
is remarkable that a man should write such a book. 
Mr. Stearns says, rather contemptuously, of Ruskin 
that " he never learned that a writer should confine 
himself to those subjects with which he is best ac- 
quainted." He implies that Macaulay was enabled 
by means of the " handle to his name " to " obtain

publication for any amount of trash." He calls 
Taine's account of Thackeray a rigmarole, and adds 
that " it seems a shame to apply this word to the 
work of so amiable a writer, but there is no other 
that suits the case." These remarks will suggest to 
the reader a sufficient criticism upon the work that 
contains them.

A fresh help to an acquaintance with

Merriam has enjoyed unusual advantages for the 
study of birds from her childhood, in the field in

ornithologists. She has been trained to careful 
and systematic habits of observation, and the re- 
sults she offers upon any points pertaining to her 
theme are to be accepted as having authority. 
In her class-work with students she has felt the 
need of a simple " bird-book for beginners," and 
with unquestioned intelligence has set herself to the 
task of supplying the want. Her attempt is limited 
to those birds which are most common,' and there- 
fore the first and readiest to catch the eye and ear 
that are open to the sights and sounds of nature. 
The book is meant as an initial stepping-stone in 
the acquisition of bird-lore, and is therefore simple 
in every particular. There is no attempt at scien- 
tific classification, there are no technicalities ; but 
there are plentiful helps in the way of color-keys 
for the identification of 154 species of our more 
familiar birds, and in choice illustrations and lucid 
and attractive verbal descriptions. Miss Merriam 
has much interesting knowledge to convey, original 
with herself or received at first-hand from bird- 
lovers who have bestowed painstaking attention 
upon the subject. She has given particular promi- 
nence to the usefulness of the birds in their relation 
to agriculture, in the majority of cases mentioning 
the noxious insects or small mammals on which each 
species chiefly subsists, thereby showing explicitly 
the incalculable service it renders to the farmer and 
the market gardener. Although one of many bird 
books lately published, it is by no means a repeti- 
tion of what has gone before. It has a fresh flavor 
which will be appreciated by the novice as well as 
by those who know most of the matter it treats. 

Mr. William S. Pelletreau, editor of 
" Southampton Records " and author 
of a history of Putnam County, N. Y., 
is well known to students of local history, who will 
now rise up and call him blessed for the sumptuous 
volume of " Early Long Island Wills " which his 
scholarly zeal, cooperating with the artistic tastes 
of Mr. Francis P. Harper, his publisher, has put 
into their hands. The work is an unabridged copy 
of the manuscript volume known as the " Lester 
Will Book," and is the record of the Prerogative 
Court of the County of Suffolk, N. Y. In En- 



gland until recent years wills were probated in an 
ecclesiastical court of the archbishop of Canterbury ; 
and when, in 1686, in the Province of New York, 
the probate of wills was reserved to the Governor, 
the name of the court out of which this secular 
jurisdiction arose was retained. This record-book 
of a public court passed out of the county clerk's 
office with the retiring clerk in 1811, and was for 
many years lost to the public among the papers of 
his family, until in 1871 it was restored to its official 
resting-place. Mr. Pelletreau has edited this valu- 
able collection with his usual accuracy, and has en- 
riched it with genealogical and historical notes, and 
fairly exhaustive indexes of persons and localities. 
The true historian does not fail to appreciate the 
value of such work as this. The publication, in 
accurate reproduction, of such portions of family 
history as our courts preserve in their records of 
marriages, probates, and even litigation, will aid in 
an important side-study of the social and domestic 
life of our forefathers, through which we can best 
come at the very "form and pressure" of their 
age. Perhaps it would have been better not to 
claim that the indexes are exhaustive, as such a 
claim puts the critic on his mettle. A verification 
through the twenty-six references under " Halsey " 
and the one hundred and six under " Howell " dis- 
covers two wrong references and five omissions. 
This proves only that perfection is not to be ex- 
pected. 

Monuments of Some months ago (THE DlAL, July 

ruined cities 16, 1897) we reviewed the first part 

of Mexico. of Prof w H Holmes's "Archjeo- 

logical Studies among the Ancient Cities of Mexico," 
issued in the Anthropological Series of the Publica- 
tions of the Field Columbian Museum. The second 
part, now out, continues this valuable work. The 
area studied is not so full of striking ruins as Yuca- 
tan, but presents some most important and interest- 
ing results. Palenque, Mitla, Monte Alban, San 
Juan de Teotihuacan, are all well-known names. 
All but Monte Alban have been frequently described. 
Professor Holmes, however, brings out some points 
of interest which are either new or but little known. 
One or these is the locality of the quarries whence 
the stones for the buildings at Mitla were taken, 
with an account of the mode of work pursued. As 
in Part I., special stress is laid upon constructional 
features. The series of panoramic views is con- 
tinued. The matter regarding Monte Alban, though 
admittedly fragmentary, is probably greater than 
has before been printed by any student. This 
mighty mass of constructions is one of the most 
significant in Mexico. Within easy walking dis- 
tance of one of the largest cities of the Republic 
Oaxaca where several diligent collectors live and 
where an important scientific institute is located, it 
is yet surprisingly little known. From Dupaix to 
Bandolier it was practically neglected. Mr. Ban- 
delier made a hasty sketch-map and some notes ; 
later Professor Starr added a few items. Mr.

A pot-pourri 
from Profettor 
Max Miller. 



Holmes gives the best ground-plan so far presented, 
with a striking panorama. Much remains to be 
done at this interesting site. The latter part of 
Professor Holmes's work describes a number of 
fine specimens recently secured by the Columbian 
Museum from the Mexican area. The Museum is 
to be congratulated upon so creditable a beginning 
in anthropological publication ; and commiserated 
upon losing at this time the services of Professor 
Holmes, who has been a most competent official. 

It is related of Neander, the Church 
historian, that, being ordered to Carls- 
bad for rest under his physician's 
express injunction to take no books with him, he 
pleaded so earnestly for some mitigation of his sen- 
tence that he was at last grudgingly allowed one 
work wherewith to soothe the tedium of exile. The 
Professor accordingly selected the Fathers, a cart- 
load of whom were found at his door by the dis- 
mayed doctor the next morning. In a case gener- 
ally similar to the foregoing one, Professor Max 
Muller seems to have recently had some notion of 
carrying the " Rig Veda" with him to a dull water- 
ing-place to which he had been banished, by way of 
arming himself with a little congenial light reading 
against the ennui of enforced idleness. Other coun- 
sels prevailed, however, and in lieu of books he con- 
tented himself with a plentiful supply of pens, ink, 
and paper. The outcome of this expedient is a 
pleasant little volume of memories of " Auld Lang 
Syne" a "small portion," as the author says, "of 
the panorama of life which has passed before his 
eyes." The text is divided into " Musical Recollec- 
tions," "Literary Recollections," " Recollections of 
Royalties," etc., and the narrative begins with a 
retrospect of the writer's childhood in that nest of 
musicians, Dessau, wheref rom we learn, by-the-bye, 
that the distinguished philologist was himself then 
regarded as an " infant prodigy " in the musical 
way, and that in this character he used to be hoisted 
upon a table to warble Handel's " Schnell wie des 
Blitzes Strahl," and other trying arias. Among 
Professor Muller' s musicians are Hiller, Mme. Sonn- 
tag, Mendelssohn, Weber, Jenny Lind, Liszt, Schu- 
mann, and others. His list of literati is a long one, 
comprising such names as Heine, Rtickert, Tenny- 
son, Arnold, Froude, Ruskin, Browning, Carlyle, 
Emerson, Holmes, Lowell, Macaulay, Darwin, Hux- 
ley, Faraday, etc. With royalty, Professor Muller 
has come in frequent and agreeable contact, and he 
managed to survive the ordeal even of a meeting 
with the Consecrated Person of Germany himself. 
One of his most cherished memories is that he once 
won a sixpence from the Prince of Wales at whist. 
Professor Muller assures us that on this occasion, a 
disputed point of play arising, "I held my own, and 
actually appealed to General Bruce ! " This was 
true courage. The Professor has the sixpence yet. 
We may say in passing that we forgot to include 
Thackeray in the list of the author's literary peo- 
ple. Of Heine the Professor had but a fleeting 



glimpse. It was at Paris in 1846, and the poet 
was then nearing his final state of hopeless physical 
collapse. Says the writer : " One afternoon as I 
and my friend were sitting on the Boulevard, sip- 
ping a cup of coffee, 'Look here,' he said, 'there 
comes Heine!' I jumped up to see, my friend 
stopped him, and told him who I was. It was a 
sad sight He was bent down, and dragged him- 
self slowly along, his spare greyish hair was hang- 
ing round his emaciated face, there was no light in 
his eyes. He lifted one of his paralyzed eyelids 
with his hand and looked at me. For a time, like 
the blue sky breaking from behind grey October 
clouds, there passed a friendly expression across his 
face, as if he thought of days long gone by. Then 
he moved on, mumbling a line from Goethe, in a 
deep, broken, and yet clear voice, as if appealing 
for sympathy: 'Das Maulthier sucht im Nebel 
seinen Weg' " A moving picture ! Professor Mul- 
ler's book (Scribner) is an entertaining pot-pourri 
compounded of pen-pictures of eminent people and 
the club-corner chat of a man of the world and of 
letters. The frontispiece portrait of the author is 
well-made but why should this venerable Oxford 
professor have thought fit to pose before the cam- 
era in a gala costume that seems about midway be- 
tween a full-dress naval uniform and the toggery of 
a marshal of an Orange parade? 

The " Heroes of the Nations " series 
(Putnam) is supposed to present 
studies of men and of national con- 
ditions, written in a style both scholarly and popular. 
The latest addition, "The Cid," by Mr. H. Butler 
Clarke, is without doubt a scholarly work, but it will 
be read with difficulty by persons not familiar with 
the period of Spanish history under consideration. 
The stories of battles, single combats, guerrilla expe- 
ditions, and trials by battle, in which the Cid or his 
companions engaged, while told in a way that leaves 
no doubt of the writer's familiarity with his author- 
ities, do not form any connected whole, and become 
wearisome by the repetition of the details of petty 
fights. The Cid, a soldier of fortune, while prefer- 
ring to use his abilities in the employ of his native 
prince, served all masters as opportunity offered, 
and was equally at home in the camp of the Spaniard 
or the Saracen. The best portion of the book is 
that relating to the service rendered by the Cid to 
Mohammedan rulers, and is a clear statement of 
conditions existing in the various Saracen King- 
doms, and of the relations between a ruling Moham- 
medan and a subject Christian population. 

Under the title " The Sacrifice of a 
Throne" (Bonnell, Silver & Co.) 
Mr. H. Remsen Waterhouse has 
written a book which purports to narrate the events 
leading to the brief occupancy of the Spanish throne 
by Amadeus, second son of Victor Emanuel I., King 
of Italy. Events there are in plenty, accurately 
stated in painstaking detail, yet leaving the reader

quite in the dark as to the author's opinion of their 
relative importance. No interpretation of them is 
given, nor is there any statement of the conditions 
in Spain which caused the fall of the Bourbons and 
made impossible the success of Amadeus's govern- 
ment. In one chapter only is there any approach 
to a true historical method ; and even here the chief 
value is to be found in the translation of documents, 
and of speeches by the King and members of the 
Cortes, in reference to the abdication. The author 
worships his hero, and endows him with all the 
virtues, physical courage in particular ; but fails to 
show him possessed of either statesmanlike qualities 
or governing ability. As an historical monograph 
on an interesting epoch of Spanish history, or as a 
character study, the book does not meet the require- 
ments of the case. Yet for those who are interested 
in a prince per se, and care to read petty personal 
characteristics, the author, in somewhat pompons 
style and with a lack of connectiveness which is often 
exasperating, has furnished some interesting matter. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The " comic history " is a dreary sort of fooling at 
its best, and we cannot give a very cordial welcome to 
the latest example of that species of humor. Mr. 
Charles M. Snyder is the author, and his book is a 
" Comic History of Greece " (Lippincott). The sort of 
thing he gives us to the amount of four or five hundred 
pages may be illustrated by a specimen taken at ran- 
dom : " The soil of Greece was principally the result of 
contact with the Persians, who soiled everything on 
which they laid hands. Very little could be raised upon 
it except levies and a particularly violent species of 
Cain." Of such cheap journalistic wit is this volume 
all compact, and the illustrations are as cheap and vul- 
gar as the text. 

Mr. L. H. Bailey, with a certain amount of specialist 
collaboration, has produced in " Garden-Making " (Mac- 
millan) a complete vade mecum for the amateur who is 
fortunate enough to have a cultivable plot of ground 
about his house. The little book is simply packed with 
information about the treatment of flowers and orna- 
mental shrubs, of fruits and vegetables, all extremely 
practical in its form of statement, yet having an eye 
constantly fixed upon the aesthetic side of the subject. 
A more useful book of its sort we have never seen, or 
one more indispensable to the amateur gardener. The 
same writer's " First Lessons with Plants " (Macmillan) 
is an equally admirable work, being addressed to teach- 
ers of very young people, and designed as a help in 
what it is the fashion of the day to call " nature study " 
in the elementary schools. 

" The Miniature Oxford Horace," just published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde, includes the complete works of the 
poet, edited by the Dean of Lincoln, in one small vol- 
ume of pocketable size. There is not a word of En- 
glish anywhere in or about the book. Annotation is 
reduced to a minimum, being confined to an occasional 
variant reading, but the text is printed upon writing 
paper with margins wide enough to permit the owner 
to make his own notes. 



ANNOUNCEMENTS or SPRING BOOKS. 

THE DIAL presents herewith its annual list of books 
announced for Spring publication, and believes it will 
be found as comprehensive and full of interest to book- 
buyers as any yet published in these columns. It con- 
tains over 600 titles, 100 more than last year's list, 
and represents 68 publishers. It is intended that no 
book published prior to March 1 be included in this 
list, and all the books here given are presumably new 
books new editions not being included unless having 
new form or matter. A list of announcements of the 
English publishers is given in the English correspond- 
ence (page 175).

I.ITERARY NOTES. 



The American Book Co. publish "A Laboratory 
Manual in Practical Botany," by Dr. Charles H. Clark. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. have just published a 
new edition, " enlarged," of " The Translation of a Sav- 
age," by Mr. Gilbert Parker. 

" The Painter in Oil," a technical treatise of moderate 
dimensions by Mr. Dauiel Burleigh Parkhursfc, has just 
been published by Messrs. Lee & Shepard. 

Mr. Kipling's famous " Recessional " has been issued 
in neat pamphlet form, with decorations by Miss 
Blanche McManus, by Mr. M. F. Mansfield of New York. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish "Exercises in 
Conversational German," and "German Grammatical 
Drill," both by Miss Josepha Schrakamp, who has pro- 
duced several other German text-books. 

" Sylvandire " and " The Brigand," with " Blanche de 
Beaulieu " thrown in for full measure, constitute the 
contents of the two new volumes of Dumas in the En- 
glish edition published by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 

An exhibition of rare books and beautiful bindings, 
arranged by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons and man- 
aged by Mr. Ernest D. North, was one of the most in- 
teresting things to be seen in Chicago during the first 
week of March. Among the books displayed were a 
Chaucer of 1598, formerly owned by Charles Lamb, the 
" Poems by Two Brothers," first editions of many En- 
glish classics, and examples of the Kelmscott and Gro- 
lier Club publications. The bindings offered a selec- 
tion from the best French and English artists, with a 
sprinkling of Americans. 

The long-pending " Loud bill," for the correction of 
alleged abuses in the transmission of periodicals and 
other second-class matter through the mails, has been 
beaten by a very decided majority in the House of Repre- 
sentatives. This defeat will prove a real good if it 
shall lead to the step that ought to have been taken long

ago the creation by Congress of a commission to over- 
haul the whole mass of our postal laws and rulings, and 
report a bill which shall cover the subject completely, 
and not partially, as did the Loud bill. Abuses, injus- 
tices, and needless inconsistency and confusion, exist in 
our postal service; but the evils are of too long stand- 
ing, and too intricate, to be treated by the 'prentice 
hand of any Congressman, however zealous and well- 
meaning. They must be handled by experts, and the 
best experts obtainable. 

The dean of English poets died with Frederick Ten- 
nyson on the twenty-seventh of last month. Born in 
1807, two years before the most famous of his brothers, 
he had lived to the ripe age of ninety years, and done 
good service to English letters. His poems have never 
been appreciated at their full value, for the affections 
of the reading public seein to have had room for but 
one poet of the name, and the considerable achieve- 
ments of Frederick Tennyson suffered partial eclipse his 
whole life long. From the famous " Poems by Two 
Brothers," which his own contributions really made 
"Poems by Three Brothers," to the publication of 
"Poems of the Day and Year" in 1895, he put forth at 
intervals collections of verse distinguished for their 
grace, melody, and classical mould. Perhaps the best 
known of his work is contained in the " Day and Hours " 
of 1854, the "Isles of Greece" of 1890, and the 
" Daphne and Other Poems " of 1891. Unlike the late 
Lord Tennyson, he lived many years away from En- 
gland with his Italian wife in Florence and Pisa, and 
for a long time in the Island of Jersey, although he 
made frequent visits to his native country. 

The Caxton Club of Chicago has hit upon a happy 
selection for the latest of its Publications, " Some Let- 
ters of Edgar Allan Poe to E. H. N. Patterson, of 
Oquawka, Illinois, with Comments by Eugene Field." 
The Poe letters are four in number; the first is dated 
April 1849, and the last August 7 of the same year 
just two months before Poe's death. They have not 
before (says a foot-note) been printed in book form; 
they are highly interesting and characteristic, and relate 
to a singular literary project that of establishing a 
pretentious national magazine at Oquawka, to be edited 
by Poe and published by Mr. Patterson, an enterprising 
and educated young man living in that remote Missis- 
sippi river town. The project seems so grotesque, 
though treated in the letters with such apparent serious- 
ness, that we might almost think the whole thing one of 
Eugene Field's literary pranks. But the letters from 
Poe seem real enough, and they are given in a marvel- 
lously executed facsimile which is one of the most nota- 
ble features of the book. There is a facsimile, also, of 
Poe's drawing for the title-page of his projected maga- 
zine, " The Stylus." The volume is a thin quarto, beau- 
tifully printed, and is highly creditable to the Caxton 
Club and to its printers, Messrs. R. R. Donnelley & 
Sons. With so much to praise, we" may be allowed two 
criticisms. The first is on a typographical detail the 
arrangement of the title-page with an unsightly division 
of Poe's name, " Edgar Allan " appearing in one line 
and " Poe " in another: a whimsy of typography which 
seems particularly out of place in a work of such severe 
and classic elegance. The other matter is more serious 
the statement in a foot-note that James Russell 
Lowell " played a trick " on Chicago in 1887. The note, 
it is presumed, is Field's; but the club might well have 
suppressed a note so mistaken in fact and so little cred- 
itable to the writer of it.

NEW AND FORTHCOMING BOOKS. 

IN THIS OUR WORLD. 

By CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON. With a Photogravure Portrait. 16mo, cloth, ornamental, $1.25. 

Mrs. Stetson's verse, which Mr. Howells has called the best civic satire since the " Biglow Papers," is known to the 
public only through the paper-covered editions which have appeared on the Coast. This new volume, revised and greatly 
enlarged, may be expected to bring her work, for the first time, into general notice. Certainly the vigor, the verve, the 
deep moral earnestness, the delightful humor and extraordinary talent for satire displayed in these poems have hardly 
been surpassed. 

WOMEN AND ECONOMICS. 

By CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

In writing this book it has been Mrs. Stetson's purpose to point out, explain, and justify the changes which are now 
going on in the relations of women to society. In brief, the position taken is that women have for centuries been eco- 
nomically dependent upon men ; that as a result they have become more and more feminine and less and less normal mem- 
bers of the human race. The argument is extended to every branch of social activity with remarkable originality, and in 
a manner to stimulate the interest of every one. It may safely be said that hardly any book of recent years has treated a 
confused subject with so much real intelligence and in an attitude so singularly fair and high-minded. 

THE BIRTH OF GALAHAD. 

A Romantic Drama by RICHARD HOVEY. 16mo, vellum back, design in gold, and paper board sides, $1.50. 

The latest of Mr. Hovey's notable series, entitled "Launcelot and Quenevere" a poem in dramas (masques and 
plays) dealing with the central story of Arthurian legendry, and intended to have a certain unity as a whole without de- 
stroying the unity of each volume as a separate work. 

The Publishers also announce new editions, in uniform binding, of Mr. Hovey's 



THE QUEST OF MERLIN. 

A Masque. Bound uniform with The Birth of Gala- 
had. 12mo, $1.25. 

"Indisputable talent and indisputable metrical faculty." 
The Athenaeum. 

NORTHLAND LYRICS. 
By WILLIAM CARMAN ROBERTS, THEODORE ROB- 
ERTS, and ELIZABETH ROBERTS MACDONALD. Se- 
lected and arranged by Charles G. D. Roberts. With 
a Prologue by Charles G. D. Roberts and an Epilogue 
by Bliss Carman. Bound in rough green cloth, gilt 
edges, with a panel design in blind by Bertram Gros- 
venor Goodhue. Small 4to, $1.50. 



THE MARRIAGE OF GUENEVERE. 

A Tragedy. Bound uniform with The Birth of Gala- 
had. 12mo, $1.50. 

"The volume shows powers of a very unusual qual- 
ity ... capacity of seeing, and by a few happy touches, 
making us see." The Nineteenth Century. 

THE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE. 

By MARCEL SCHWOB. Translated by Henry Copley 
Greene. The edition is limited to five hundred copies, 
from type, printed on Italian hand-made paper, with 
a symbolistic cover-design in green, purple, and gray, 
by Tom B. Meteyard. 16mo, $1.00 net. 



WALT WHITMAN'S 

COMPLETE PROSE, $2.00. LEAVES OF GRASS, $1-25. 

CALAMUS: LETTERS TO PETER DOYLE, $1.25. 

Of the new " Leaves of Grass " the New York Tribune says : " It is a just and generous tribute to a writer who has 
deserved more than he has received at the hands of the book-makers." 

SELECTIONS FROM THE PROSE AND POETRY OF 
WALT WHITMAN. 

Edited, with an introduction, by Oscar Lovell Triggs, Ph.D., of the University of Chicago. With a frontis- 
piece portrait. Crown 8vo, cloth, $1.25. 

An adequate selection of Whitman's writings has long been called for, and it is here furnished. Dr. Triggs has suc- 
cessfully attempted to make a book which should be representative of the many-sidedness of Whitman's genius, and at 
the same time attractive to the general reader. Both as a book of selections, pure and simple, and as an introduction to the 
study of Whitman, it should meet with a welcome from all those interested in the growing fame of the Poet of Democracy. 

THE WOUND DRESSER. 

A series of letters written from the hospitals in Washington during the War of the Rebellion by WALT 
WHITMAN. Edited by Richard Maurice Bucke, M.D. With two Portraits. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Without doubt the most intimate and vivid account of the hospital life of the Civil War ever put in print. According 
to the Chap-Book, the letters are " * human documents,' without which and the like of which the world were poor indeed." 
They form, says the Brooklyn Eagle, "a tale that is unique in character and without precedent in literature "; while the 
Literary World speaks of " their profound sympathy with the suffering and dying, their minuteness of detail, so that by 
their light yon see the cot and the operating-table, and the sunken cheek and the glazing eye, their reproduction of the 
very colors of the tragic movement of which Washington was the centre from 1861 to 1865."

A New Volume in the Captain January Series. 

ROSIN THE BEAU. 

A sequel to " Melody " and " Marie." By LAURA E. 
RICHARDS. With half-tone frontispiece by FRANK 
T. MERRILL. 

The many thousands who have read the author's exquisite stories, 
" Melody " and " Marie," will be glad to learn more of the picturesque 
old violinist who figured so prominently in the former story, and the 
charming Marie of the latter. 

16 mo, cloth back and paper sides, 50 cents. 

JOSEPH JEFFERSON AT HOME. 

By NATHAN HASKELL DOLE. A monograph on Joseph 
Jefferson and his home surroundings. Illustrated 
with 16 full-page half-tones from photographs taken 
with the permission of Mr. Jefferson in and around 
his famous summer home. 

Mr. Jefferson being recognized as the leading American actor, the 
appearance of this small volume will be very interesting, and throwing 
as it does a new light on him as a painter as well as an actor, and giving 
new ideas concerning his home life, it surely should receive a warm 
welcome. 

Thin octavo, gilt top, 81.50. 

THE SLOPES OF HELICON, 

And Other Poems. By LLOYD MIFFLIN. Illustrated 
with 10 full-page illustrations by T. MORAX, N.A., 
and others, and a portrait of the author. 

Mr. Mifflin is distinctively the poet of his own fields and hills, and 
to those who know him only through his remarkable sonnets, " At the 
Gates of Song," this new volume will be a revelation. It will settle the 
question often asked, whether a sonnet-writer of distinction can also 
be a lyrist. The book is very interesting also as shedding more light 
upon the poet's inner life and character, and will be sure to bring Mr. 
Mifflin many new readers. The tone of the book is high ; the workman- 
ship what might be expected from one who has proved himself a master 
of the most difficult form of English verse ; and the whole is a real con- 
tribution to American literature. 

Tall 16mo, handsome cover design, deckle-edge paper, 
gilt top, 81.25. 



THE VALLEY PATH. 

By WILL ALLEN DROMGOOLE, author of The Heart 
of Old Hickory." 

This volume is an excellent novel of Tennessee life ; the characters 
are very strongly portrayed, and the story is one of extreme interest 
throughout. 

Like all Miss Dromgoole's writings, it is singularly true to life, and 
reveals that intimate knowledge of the hopes, aspirations, fears, and 
doubts of the human heart which is one of the distinguishing points 
between a writer of true ability and a mediocre story-teller. 

12mo, handsome cover design, deckle-edge paper, gilt 
top, 81.25. 

SONGS OF TWO PEOPLES. 

By JAMES RILEY, author of " The Transmitted Word," 

etc. 

This volume is a collection of dialect poems, showing a thorough and 
appreciative knowledge and generous estimate of the character and 
virtues of the two races, the Saxon and the Celt, as they met in the 
past, and are meeting cow, each day, in the common, homely ways of 
real life in America.

This new book by Mr. Le Gallienne is uniform with " The Quest of the Golden Girl," which is now in its ninth edition. 



THIRD EDITION IN PREPARATION. 

POEMS BY STEPHEN PHILLIPS. Crown 8vo, boards, $1.50. 

To Mr. Stephen Phillips has been awarded by the proprietors of The Academy (London), a premium of one hundred guineas, in accordance 
with their previously proclaimed intention of making that, and a second gift of fifty guineas, to the writers of the two books which should be 
adjudged worthy to be " crowned " as the most important contributions to the literature of 1897. 

The London Times says : " Mr. Phillips is a poet, one of the half-dozen men of the younger generation whose writings contain the indefinable 
quality which makes for permanence." 

The London Academy says : " How could language express more. It has an almost physical effect upon the reader, in the opening of the 
eyes and the dilation of the heart." 

The London Daily Chronicle says : " Almost the whole of this book is concerned with life and death largely and liberally contemplated. 
It is precisely that kind of contemplation which our recent poetry lacks. . . . We praise Mr. Phillips for many excellences, but chiefly for the 
great air and ardor of his poetry, its persistent loftiness." 



THE KING WITH TWO FACES. By M. E. COLERIDGE. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

The London Times says : " Is one of the very rare novels which yield so much pleasure that it almost stifles criticism. The author's quality 
is that of perfectly original brilliancy in romantic narration."

A NEW HISTORICAL ROMANCE. 

John Gilbert, Yeoman. 

By R. G. SOAKS. With Frontispiece by LANCELOT SPEED. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

,* This stirring historical story is laid in Cromwell's days, when 
Royalists and Parliamentarians were still at strife ; and a prominent 
character in the novel is the Protector himself. 

The Scotsman, the opinions of which in literary matters are held in 
high estimation, says : " The author has produced a story which will 
bear comparison with the best historical fiction of modern writers. It 
is far above an immense mass of novels sent out recently . . . contain- 
ing nothing flimsy or trivial, and in certain features it even recalls the 
romances of Scott."

FIFTH THOUSAND OF 

FREE TO SERVE. A Tale of Colonial New York. 

By E. RAYNER. Price, $1.50. 

CLINTON ROSS says in The Chap Book : "The proof of a long book is in the reading of it ... The author, an artist, never once ob- 
trudes her personality. The life of the actors is cleverly real, but the high distinction of ' Free to Serve ' is its realization of humanity. It 's a 
notable book so much better than Hugh Wynne ' that if the publishers' claim for that book be true this novel is greater it is certainly one 
of the American novels of the year. And Dutch America has no better presentation than E. Rayner's in ' Free to Serve.' " 

THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT says : " The book is not the work of a novice ; it is fascinating, strong, and of the highest moral tone. . . . 
The characters are finely delineated, the varied and rapidly shifting scenes are pictured with the skill of an artist, and the pure moral tone is car- 
ried through the whole like a golden thread. We advise all to read the book." 

THE PHILADELPHIA CALL says : " It does for the life and fashions of old New York what Weir Mitchell's ' Hugh Wynne ' did for 
Philadelphia. . . . There is plenty of action in the transition from chapter to chapter, some strongly drawn character-etching, and an intense vein 
of human interest. Few will pick up the tale without feeling the charm of its style and the subtle fascination of its subject matter. " 

SECOND EDITION OF 



HARVARD EPISODES. 



By CHARLES MACOMB FLANDRAU, '95. Crimson Cloth, Octavo. Price, $1.25. 

In this book Mr. Flandrau has departed widely from the usual college story. He has, in a series of short, vivid sketches, drawn the modern 
" Harvard Man " as he if, not as he hat been, or as he ought to be, but truthfully as he is. The book does not, naturally, detail all sides of the 
present complex Harvard life, but for the side which it does treat, the typical, prosperous, happy side, it does the best thing tells the truth, 
and tells it in a most delightful fashion. We feel sure that so accurate a picture of modern college life has not yet been drawn, and that all col- 
lege men will appreciate this and heartily welcome the book.

" THE DIAL is the best and 
ablest literary paper in the 
country." JOHN Q. WHTT- 
TDIB (Aug. 19, 1892). 

" A journal of literary crit- 
icism, sober, conscientious, 
and scholarly; from every 
point of view unsurpassed by 
any other literary journal in 
America or England." Sir 
WALTKK BESANT. 

" THE DIAL is most useful 
and essential to the lover and 
purchaser of books." R. C. 
WOODWARD, Librarian War- 
der Library, Springfield, O. 

" THE DIAL has reached a 
height at which no periodical 
in America devoted to liter- 
ary criticism can justly claim 
to be its superior." DEKISON 

QUARTERLY. 

"As a journal for the 
teacher who would keep in 
touch with the best thought 
of the day, THE DIAL, is in- 
dispensable." JOCRSAL OF 
PEDAGOGY. 

"THE DIAL'S look and 
bearing are refinement itself. 
Seriousness, fearless care, and 
a right instinct in letters, help 
to make it the best review we j 
have." THE INDEPENDENT, [ 
New York.

The Best Literary Journal In America 

Must be considered as indispensable to every person who 
really has an interest in literary affairs, who would keep in 
touch with literary events and within the current of the best 
literary influences, and who recognizes and cares for the 
qualities of INDEPENDENCE, ABILITY, FAIRNESS AND HON- 
ESTY IN REVIEWS OF THE NEWEST BOOKS, DISCUS- 
SIONS OF LITERARY AND EDUCATIONAL QUES- 
TIONS, and NEWS OF LITERARY EVENTS. Full Lists 
of all the New Books published, including, size, price, etc., 
of each, with other features that constitute a complete and 
agreeable GUIDE AND INDEX TO CURRENT LITERA- 
TURE. 

In the flood of books pouring from the press, there is so 
much to choose from that no person can, unaided, judge what 
is to be read and what left unread. Hence, a journal that 
may be steadily relied upon as a safe guide to the character, 
the contents, the merits, and demerits of the important New 
Books, is obviously of the greatest value to anyone of literary 
inclination or pursuits. Such a journal THE DIAL has long 
been known to be. In its pages all books are described and 
discussed upon their merits, and without fear or favor.

' ' I have the greatest admir- 
ation for THE DIAL and its 
work." Rev. Dr. EDWARD 
EVERETT HALE, Boston. 

" I can always trust the re' 
views in THE DIAL to be ex- 
pressions of honest opinion; 
and honest judgments of con- 
temporary publications are of 
the greatest possible value to 
a man who cannot find time

fraction of them for himself."

fore free from sensationalism and from any pandering

THE CHAP-BOOK. 

" Chicago's handsome CHAP-BOOK . . . has estab- 
lished itself as the most amusing, the most readable, of

A Norwegian 

Grammar 

and Reader 

With Notes and 
Vocabulary 



By JULIUS E. OLSON, Pro- 
fessor of Scandinavian 
Languages and Litera- 
ture in the University of 
Wisconsin. 

An increasing interest in 
Norwegian literature has been 
manifest in recent years, on 
account of the commanding position that men like Ibsen 
and Bjornson occupy in the field of letters. Much diffi- 
culty has, however, been experienced by American students, 
in getting at this literature in the original. A suitable 
Grammar and Reader is now offered which meets all de- 
mands. Part I. contains in addition to a comprehensive 
Grammar, ample notes on the structure of the language, 
explicit directions on pronunciation, and many carefully 
translated illustrative sentences. Part II. contains selec- 
tions in poetry and prose of literary excellence or historical 
interest, from distinguished Norwegian writers.

A Critical Analysis

Mrs. Sherman in her an-

justice, and declaring that the soul can find satisfaction only 
as it lives, moves, and has its being in God the Source of 
all good.

[April 1, 1898. 



D. Appleton & Company's New Books 



TWO NOTABLE WAR NOVELS. 

The Disaster. 

A Romance of the Franco-Prussian War. By PAUL and 

VICTOR MABGUEBITTE. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

" This powerful picture of the fate of the Army of the Rhine, by the 
sons of one of the generals who did their duty, is among the finest 
descriptions of war that have been penned." London Athenaeum. 

"A strong, a remarkable book. 'The Disaster ' is even more over- 
whelming than Zola's 'Le D^bScle.' Zola's soldiers possessed, after 
all, the untold advantage of their ignorance. But the officers in ' The 
Disaster' saw everything, understood from the very beginning the 
immensity of the blunder. Like the spectators of some grim tragedy, 
they waited and watched for the curtain to fall." London Speaker. 

"A great historical novel " is the verdict of W. L. Courtenay, whose 
long review in the London Telegraph characterizes " The Disaster " as 
"a singularly impressive and fascinating book." 

The Broom of the War God. 

A Story of the Recent War between the Greeks and Turks. 

By HENRY NOEL BRAILSFORD. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

"A book of decidedly unusual quality. It is vivid, strong, realistic, 
and never sensational. As a picture of real war, and as a pitiless por- 
trayal of Greek incompetence, it has the fidelity and sharpness of a 
photograph. Its realism is so genuine that we feel the full pathos of 
the tragedy." Brooklyn Eagle. 

" One of the most interesting novels of the year. Captivating both 
as to plot and manner of development." San Francisco Call. 

" A graphic and undisguised picture done in a delightfully up-to-date 
style, which holds the reader from start to finish." Philadelphia 
Record. 



Eastern Journeys. 

Some Notes of Travel in Russia, in the Caucasus, and to Jeru- 
salem. By CHARLES A. DANA. 16mo, cloth, $1.00. 
No one could have been better equipped for such a journey than the 
observant, cultured, and much-travelled author, who improved his 
opportunities to the full. The result is a delightful book of travels 
which pictures many unfamiliar phases of life and describes unhackneyed 
journeys. 

Points in Minor Tactics. 

Compiled and arranged in an elementary manner for the 
Infantry of the National Guard of the United States. By 
Captain CHARLES A. SMYLIE, Twelfth Infantry, N. G., 
N. Y. With illustrations. 12mo, cloth, $1.00. 

This Little World. 

A Novel. By D. CHRISTIE MURRAY. No. 236, Appletons' 
Town and Country Library. 12mo, cloth, $1.00; paper, 
50 cents. 

Mr. Murray is at his best in this well-designed and thoroughly enter- 
taining story of rural and of artistic life. 

"The author interests us by the delicacy of his characterizations. . . . 
It is pleasant to congratulate him." London Academy. 

The Psychologic Foundations of 
Education. 

An attempt to show the Genesis of the Higher Faculties of 
the Mind. By WILLIAM T. HARRIS, A.M., LL.D., U. S. 
Commissioner of Education. Vol. XXXVII., Interna- 
tional Education Series. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

The Story of Life in the Seas. 

By SYDNEY J. HICKSON. Illustrated. 16mo, cloth, 40 cents. 
This is a clear and simple exposition of the salient features of marine 
life, aided by useful illustrations. 



A Voyage of Consolation. 

By Mrs. E. C. COTES (Sara Jeanette Duncan), author of "A 
Social Departure," "An American Girl in London," "His 
Honour and a Lady," etc. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 
" Anyone who has met the touring American will appreciate his pic- 
ture as painted by Mrs. Cotes. He is amusing, seldom uninteresting." 
Chicago Tribune. 

"Humorous incidents and conversations abound, rendering the 
perusal of the book a pleasant pastime." New Yrh Times. 

A French Volunteer in the War of 
Independence. 

By the Chevalier DE PONTGIBAUD. Translated and edited by 
ROBERT B. DOUGLAS. With Introduction and Frontispiece. 
12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This entertaining book is a distinct addition to the personal side of 
Revolutionary literature, and it is peculiarly valuable, because of its 
presentation of American life and of the fathers of the Republic as seen 
by a French visitor. The hero's stormy youth and his adventurous and 
varied career give his reminiscences an intimate interest rarely to be 
found in historical fiction, while their historical value is obvious. His 
recollections include his association with Washington, Hamilton, Burr, 
and other conspicuous figures. 

Italian Literature. 

By RICHARD GABNETT, C.B., LL.D. A new volume in the 
Literatures of the World Series. Edited by EDMUND 
GOSSE. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Dr. G-arnett's abundant scholarship and power of discrimination have 
furnished an admirable equipment for the preparation of this needed 
work. In traversing the broad field of Italian literature, he has not 
confined himself simply to a few masterpieces ; but, without burdening 
his story with details, he indicates characteristic phases and significant 
movements, which are happily illustrated. His work is clear, interest- 
ing, and informing. 

Modern English Literature.

Literatures of the World Series. Uniform with "Ancient 
Greek Literature," by Gilbert Murray, and " French Liter-

a popular and yet scholarly history of English literature." London

THE PROBLEM OF THE ADEQUATE. 

Our attention was called not long ago to a 
programme outlined for an afternoon session 
of a woman's club in a certain Western city. 
It was evident that this organization was 
inspired with a praiseworthy ambition to assim- 
ilate the whole of culture within as brief a 
period as possible, and to demonstrate that art, 
in spite of the ancient dictum, was not so very 
long after all. " A Resume of Greece " was 
to be the general subject of the afternoon's en- 
tertainment, and the special subjects of Greek 
politics, literature, philosophy, and art were to 



be considered in essays extensive enough, pre- 
sumably, to occupy ten or fifteen minutes each in 
the reading. Two songs and a recitation were to 
relieve the strain of a too protracted concentra- 
tion of thought upon themes so serious, and the 
audience was to depart in edified mood, cheer- 
fully prepared to make similar resumes of Rome 
and France and England in the near future. 

Such attempts to compass culture without 
any real effort are being made all over this 
country by thousands of literary clubs, and 
Chautauqua circles, and other organizations of 
earnest people banded together for purposes of 
self-improvement. The illustration of this sort 
of intellectual stir which we have given above is 
doubtless an extreme one, but it serves us all 
the better for that, since it brings into a clearer 
light the typical features of a tendency which 
is well advised in its aims, if hardly in its 
methods, and which, if but wisely directed, 
might do much for the advancement of our 
intellectual life. It is well to acquire a little 
knowledge of even the largest subject, if only 
the acquisition be made in a properly humble 
spirit, and without self-delusion. One's own 
horizon must not be taken for the boundary of 
thought, but rather as a narrow circumscription 
marked out from the infinite, to be widened with 
every addition to one's own intellectual elevation. 
A little learning is not a dangerous thing unless 
it create a mood of smug self-sufficiency, thereby 
deadening the life that it ought rather to stim- 
ulate to a larger growth. 

The varied extensions of intellectual activity 
so characteristic of our age have made short 
cuts to knowledge an absolute necessity even 
for scholars of the most serious purpose. No 
earlier period can show anything comparable 
to the present-day production of manuals, and 
compendiums, and condensed surveys, and ele- 
mentary monographs in series. These books, 
which both in numbers and in quality outdo 
everything of the sort produced in earlier peri- 
ods, are the outcome of a genuine need, and 
offer the older ideal of culture its only possible 
defence against the swelling flood of specializa- 
tion. The day has long passed when a man 
could hope to take all knowledge for his prov- 
ince, and the scholars of towering intellectual 
stature who, from Bacon to Humboldt, domin- 
ated the thought of their respective epochs, 



216 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



belong to a hopelessly vanished race. Mr. Her- 
bert Spencer probably comes as near as anyone 
now living to that old-time ideal, but the weak 
places in his intellectual armor are made evi- 
dent enough when tested by the searching schol- 
arship of the modern specialized type. Yet 
men are loth to give up altogether the wide 
prospect of an earlier time, and our books of 
condensed science make it possible for a scholar 
of to-day to learn all that a Humboldt could 
have known, and more, with a far greater econ- 
omy of effort in the acquisition. 

We have, then, no quarrel with the book 
which deals upon a small scale with a great 
subject, provided its writer have the authority 
and the literary art needful for the perform- 
ance of his task. Professor Freeman used to 
say that the only way to write a small book was 
to write a big one first and then condense it : 
a procedure which he applied with great success 
to the history of the Norman Conquest. Mr. 
Stopford Brooke's small manual of English 
literature will occur to many minds as an ad- 
mirable example of the proper treatment of a 
great theme within narrow limits. The litera- 
ture of the essay affords excellent illustrations 
of the same sort of achievement. There are 
essays by such men as Walter Pater, Mr. John 
Morley, and Mr. Frederick Myers, which are 
entirely adequate to their subjects, and produce 
the impression of exhaustive treatment although 
the number of their pages is small. This does 
not mean that they say all that there is to say, 
but rather that, given their limits, they say the 
most important things in the most felicitous 
way possible. To introduce a metaphor, we may 
remark that a narrow stream will suffice to 
carry a great volume of water to the sea if only 
the channel be well embanked, and the current 
restrained from spreading aimlessly abroad. 

The thesis may indeed be maintained that it 
is theoretically possible to treat fittingly of any 
subject within any limits, however contracted, 
provided one has a proper sense of the perspec- 
tive of ideas, and does not bring into a brief 
discussion such matters of detail as would be 
out of place in anything less than a whole his- 
tory. This' is not a plea for the ingenuous 
amateur who attempts to write about " Nature " 
or "History" or "The Aim of Life" in a 
thousand words, or the innocent college grad- 
uate who, during the few minutes allotted to 
the delivery of his commencement part, dis- 
courses upon the destinies of nations or the 
enlightening mission of genius. But it does 
justify the master of a subject in the work of 



selection and arrangement whereby the ripest 
fruits of his enormous intellectual toil are 
brought within the compass of an essay or a 
book of pocketable dimensions. When the 
really great writers devote only a few pages or 
even words to the consideration of some vast 
theme we do not complain that their treatment 
is inadequate, but accept thankfully their gifts. 
In fact, the most hopelessly inadequate books 
are apt to be the big ones, the so-called monu- 
ments of scholarship and literary industry, thus 
styled, perhaps, because their weight has 
crushed all the life out of their subjects. But 
an Emerson can write adequately of "History " 
or " Art " or " Civilization " within the space 
of a single brief paper, and we do not feel that 
the discussion is defective. A Lowell may ask 
" Will it do to say anything more about Shake- 
speare ? " and prove that it will do, for a Lowell, 
to discuss " Shakespeare Once More," even 
with the limitations of the essayist upon him. 
Or, to take a still greater exemplar, did not 
Shakespeare himself, upon hundreds of occa- 
sions, give entirely adequate expression to vast 
ranges of thought in as many pithy and preg- 
nant and divine flashes of his all- comprehending 
intellect ? Is there not a whole philosophy of 
love in the lines, 

" Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, 

Haply I think on thee, and then my state, 
Like to the lark at break of day arising 
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate," 

a whole philosophy of life in the words, 

" Men must endure 

Their going hence even as their coming hither ; 
Ripeness is all " ? 



SAITH THE STAR. 



" Heart that craves another heart, 
Weary of this life apart 

From all kindred," saith the star; 
" Be thyself thine own best place, 
Learn of me, ensphered in space, 
Solitary and afar. 

" In my loneness I am free 
To explore infinity, 

All the calm and silent night. 
Heart aflame with wild desire, 
Look to me, quench fire with fire, 

Plunge within my liquid light. 

" Had I sought some alien sphere, 
Loth to shine sequestered here," 

Saith the star reproachfully; 
" I had left, like stars of old, 
To one fleeting track of gold 
All my crystal purity."

IN REGARD TO POETRY. 

The critic who to-day lifts up his voice for poetry 
is a good deal like Roland sounding his trumpet to 
call Charlemagne back to Roncesvaus. Charle- 
magne may come he will come, but he is like 
to find the critical Roland dead npon the battle- 
field. The Muses are certainly temporarily in exile ; 
and the poets those votaries who by their intro- 
duction got admittance into the company of the 
gods, and so knew the secrets of things which they 
communicated to uninspired mortals, " mingling 
incorruptible rivers of fire " with the blood of men, 
these Vates, Seers, Makers, are out of employment, 
glad of any odd job. They even write criticism. 
At the best, they cut up the old forms of art, as 
Medea dismembered her father, and plunge them 
into the cauldron of the Novel some day, it is to 
be hoped, to emerge fresh and vigorous and in their 
early bloom. 

I make no count of lyric poetry in my diagnosis or 
prognosis. This has always been most plentiful in the 
most barren periods of literature. It is the brush- 
wood that springs up when the giant pines are felled. 
The ages of the Anthologists, the Troubadours, 
the Minnesingers, the Meistersingers, the ballad- 
writers of Spain, were ages when the poetic energies 
of the races were either spent or were gathering for 
a concentrated effort. We have been, of Lite, pass- 
ing through a period of lyrical activity ; yet there 
are not wanting signs to show that it is nearly 
ended. The little leaves of song do not flutter so 
plentifully from the autumnal boughs of the maga- 
zines, and nothing is more certain than the indiffer- 
ence of the public to collections of them herba- 
riums of pressed emotions. It is yet possible that 
the great goddess Design may rear her head again 
and revive the works of men. 

Modern thought is unquestionably hostile to great 
poetry. In religion, it has withdrawn men from 
ideas of the Creator to rest in the creation ; in phil- 
osophy, it has descended from the whole to the parts ; 
in science, it has rejected abstract ideas for prac- 
tical inventions ; in sociology, it has substituted an 
equalized democracy for great central figures. All 
this means that the spontaneous, the particular, and 
the immediate have absorbed the attention of man- 
kind ; and the lyric is the expression of the spon- 
taneous, the particular, and the immediate. 

However true or necessary all this specialized 
business is, it is not going to permanently satisfy 
men's souls. There is implanted in us an idea of 
the whole as well as of the parts. We experience 
only the imperfect and transitory ; but we know 
that the perfect and eternal exist. We bruise our 
shins against the real ; but the ideal beckons us on, 
and on we go. The innate ideas of goodness, splen- 
dor, happiness, live in us, like the Sleeping Beauty 
and her court behind the o'ergrown hedge, and only 
the kiss of Experience is needed to make them rise 
and ring with life. 

At bottom, literature is an intoxicant. It trans- 



forms us, takes us out of ourselves. Life is toler- 
ably dull, and it adds little to our liveliness to be 
told that argon is a most powerful centre of force, 
or that everything in nature has its ratio of vibra- 
tion. If the flying-machine is perfected, the globe- 
wanderer will be as bored on his tenth voyage as he 
is to-day. If we reach Mars, we will find we have 
not escaped our own personalities. Science on the 
whole has not made life any better, nobler, more 
delightful, or more amusing. But man is eternally 
interested in his own traditions, his own deeds, his 
own fate. The talk about books is the one profes- 
sional talk which is not " shop," because it is a talk 
about life itself. How instinctively we feel that the 
best society the world has known has been in those 
circles of men of intellect whose interest was in the 
humanities the Mermaid group, Johnson's club, 
the circle about Molie*re. The mass of men read 
little enough, but they have an equivalent for liter- 
ature in gossip and the swapping of stories. Con- 
versation is a continual, though for the most part 
decent, Decameron. 

If all this is true, it may be urged that the novel 
can satisfy all our intellectual needs, as, indeed, for 
the present it seems to do. There is no actual rea- 
son why a novel may not be a great work of art, 
except that the extent of the average story makes it 
difficult to take it all in at once. Our aesthetic vision 
is not f ocussed to survey such near-lying and prodi- 
giously extended masses. We are like Gulliver 
making love to the fair Brobdignagian, and can only 
get acquainted with her nose or her hand at one 
time. Yet in spite of this defect, " Don Quixote " 
and " Tristram Shandy " and Wilhelm Meister " 
rank with the great poems and dramas of the world. 
The real weakness of novels is their enormous dilu- 
tion, the detail and commonplace by which they 
seek to mirror life instead of interpreting it (as if 
they could, even with the vision of Asmodeus and 
the pen of the Recording Angel, give all the facts 
of existence), and the ease with which they seem to 
be done. If there were only two or three or a dozen 
novels, we might prize them as rare birds. But in 
their interminable multitude they are as the plague 
of locusts. I am inclined to think that the whole 
vast novel literature of the world will some day be 
as obsolete as the tomes of the Fathers and School- 
men. It is not that there is not magnificent read- 
ing in St. Augustine or Thomas Aquinas, but they 
and the multitude of their rivals and scholars picked 
the bones of dogma dry ; and, similarly, our novel- 
ists have worn human nature, in its ordinary mani- 
festations, threadbare. Besides, all great wit is dif- 
ficult difficult to do, and difficult to appreciate. 

And this leads me to one advantage of verse. 
Being hard to get at of course I mean good verse 
by both author and reader, it achieves a concen- 
tration that fastens on the memory. Its symmetry 
and numeric recurrence of sound and motion help 
it to a permanence which the looser members of 
prose can hardly hope to attain. It is discipline 
against the mob. Besides, this verse is a device, 



218 



THE DIAL, 



[April 1, 



like the frame of a picture or the raised platform 
and footlights of the stage, which lifts a piece of 
literature above the ordinary level of life and en- 
velops it in an atmosphere of its own. I suppose 
everyone has felt a slight shock at the beginning 
of a theatrical performance ; the break with life is 
apparent for a few moments ; we say to ourselves, 
" This is not real." But if we surrender ourselves 
to the impressions of the stage, the illusory scene is 
quickly accepted, its convention and make-believe 
are forgotten. In the same way, if we yield our- 
selves to the raised utterance and rhythmical accents 
of verse we soon forget that it is not the proper and 
natural language of life. Indeed, who shall say 
that it is not our proper and natural language 
that its ordered harmonies are not those which are 
most deeply impressed upon the universe ? As 
Schiller puts it, " By a wonder we must enter into 
wonderland "; and verse is a very potent key to that 
ideal world we are all striving, consciously or uncon- 
sciously, to reach and possess. 

The compact and polished marble of verse is a 
better material for the hand of the designer than 
the clay of prose. At least it keeps its edge and 
lustre longer. Above all, it lends itself to the ex- 
ception. That which would be unnatural in prose 
is entirely easy to its sonorous mouth. This is pain- 
fully felt, I think, in such set pieces of prose as De 
Quincey's " Ladies of Sorrow " and " Vision of Sud- 
den Death," or even in Milton's lofty rhapsodies. 
They are finely done, but one feels that they could 
be done better in verse. 

It would need a good deal of argument to per- 
suade people to-day that the great, the rare, the 
exceptional, are, after all, the best subjects for lit- 
erature. The opposite opinion, which began to 
take root about the middle of the last century, has 
got so firm a hold that it will take an earthquake 
to dislodge it. Diderot and Rousseau and Goethe 
and Wordsworth described or sang the lowly lives 
and humble hopes of the poor. The whole art of 
Millet and his group is based upon the almost brute 
struggle for existence. More yet ! man is discov- 
ered to be not only a brother of dragons but a 
cousin-german to the rocks and clouds. In all pre- 
vious ages he looked aloft, he walked with the gods, 
he made images of and adored the shining ones of 
the earth. In the last century and a half he has 
reversed his gaze. He looks down and finds him- 
self kin to the animals and the earth itself. He 
vitalizes the phenomena of nature, not by means of 
human personifications as among the ancients, but 
in their own proper exhibitions. In Victor Hugo's 
"Toilers of the Sea," the ocean is the sentient 
antagonist of the man ; and in Thomas Hardy's 
" Return of the Native " the moor is the real pro- 
tagonist of the piece. This is all very well, and 
if trees and rocks and oceans read books we could 
imagine them clapping their hands at being so cel- 
ebrated. But man alone is concerned with art, and 
the highest poetry vanishes when he is made a sub- 
sidiary agent in its domain. The mood that makes 



him such is a passing one. Simplicity and humility 
furnish too narrow a room for his aspiring spirit to 
flourish in. His natural inclination is to " rise and 
help Hyperion to his horse," rather than to trail 
after the hoe of the potato gatherer. Corot is a 
mightier master than Millet. Splendor and domin- 
ion and profundity are not in widest commonalty 
spread, and these are the things that man most ad- 
mires and by which he is most moved. We may 
thrill at the sight of a pump on the stage, or the 
representation of a plain farmer's home, but these 
things are not going to displace Orestes and Mac- 
beth. Even in the work of the last century, as the 
foot-hills withdraw and the peaks emerge, we can 
see that they are haunted as of old by the Spirit and 
the forming Word. The " Intimations," the " An- 
cient Mariner," " Hyperion," the " Ode to the Gen- 
estra," De Mussel's " Nights," " In Memoriam," 
"Tristan and Isolde," these works have little to 
do with the low levels of life. But while the de- 
mand for simplicity and commonplace lasts, it is 
destructive to poetry. If the plain people get it 
thoroughly established in their heads that they are 
as good subjects for literature as kings and heroes 
and poets, that pumpkin-pies and pitchforks and 
blue-jean blouses are just as important as wit and 
philosophy and divine exaltation, there will be no 
venturing verse or great designs until a new gener- 
ation appears upon the scene.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, March IS, 1898. 

This is one of the most uninteresting of " spring pub- 
lishing seasons " of many years past in England. Now 
that the lists are out, one looks over them in vain for 
any work that sounds as if it would strike attention, or 
make the year distinguished. There is a fair average 
of the stock " stuff," and when one has said that, one has 
said all that may be said. The much-heralded and 
much-advertised novels have almost all made their ap- 
pearance Mr. Anthony Hope's " Simon Dale," Mr. 
Grant Allen's "The Incidental Bishop," Mr. Conan 
Doyle's " The Tragedy of the Korosko," Mr. Stanley 
Weyman's "Shrewsbury," Mr. E. F. Benson's "The 
Vintage," and the rest; and they all betray the debili- 
tating effects of assurance, born of an unrestrained self- 
consciousness of popularity. They constitute, in effect, 
work done to represent royalties. One wonders what 
becomes of all the novels manufactured, and one wonders 
still more what will be thought of them ten or twenty 
years hence. At present the " libraries " stock their 
shelves with them, and a sober population, which pays 
the annual guineas as subscriptions, read them. Then 
a few days or weeks elapse, the demand slackens, and 
Mudie or Smith enters them in their " selling off " lists 
at half price, or less. And so the seasons come and go. 
But where will they be after several seasons ? One 
shrugs one's shoulders, and asks one's self Where ? 
Time is a saucy fellow, and it is not easy to fix his ca- 
prices in any standard of measurement, or frame from 
them a rule of consistent taste.

THE DIAL, 



219 



There is a pessimistic wail heard lately, from one or 
two of our magazines and weekly journals, intended to 
elicit our sympathy on behalf of the novelist who has, 
to use the meaning expression, " written himself out." 
A writer in this week's " Speaker," commenting upon 
an article in the " National Review," speaks of this con- 
dition, so terribly pictured by Mr. George Gissing in 
" New Grub Street," as a condition which is " beyond the 
pale of common humanity." " To be without money, 
food, or a decent coat, is an affliction intelligible to all; 
but a literary man in want of ideas cannot be taken 
seriously even by the most tender-hearted." Well, with 
all pity for such a literary man, is it not, after all, a 
happy play of the fates that a novelist cannot go on for- 
ever ? How could we ever hope to cope with the enor- 
mous output, if things were otherwise? Surely, we should 
require to begin to read with the insucking of our 
mother's milk ! And, in all seriousness, the child of 
to-day is precocious enough. The trouble, perhaps, is 
not in the writer's losing his ideas, but in his over- 
anxiety to make money as quickly as he can, giving no 
regard for the art he is expressing, and no thought for 
the dignity of his work. It is the inevitable consequence 
of a literature which is in the hands of a "profession." 

Sir Walter Besant also, on a kindred matter, delivers 
himself, in " The Author," of a belief in the decay of 
authority in literary criticism. " It is," he says, " im- 
possible perfectly impossible by any conceivable rate 
of pay, to get a reviewer to read a book which he has 
to discuss in a dozen or twenty lines. The result is often 
a weak stream of generalities, with a word of fault- 
finding, a thing quite easy for any book ever written, 
whether it be read or not and only vague words of 
praise, because praise if it is sincere must be based on 
actual reading." And yet how much praise there is to 
be found in our critiques ! Even if Sir Walter be right, 
and there is not a little to prove him in the wrong, 
on whom is the blame for this decay ? Is it not to be 
found in the large number of books written and pub- 
lished? If the founder of the Author's Society be really 
anxious for the preservation of authority in criticism, 
would he not convince us of his sincerity, to some pur- 
pose, were he to preach to his fellow-members the wis- 
dom of writing less and writing better, and not from 
the text of the " literary profession " ? Let a truly fine 
piece of literary work come up for valuation, and, ten 
chances to one, it will not miss appreciation. There never 
was a better time for the aspirant to literary fame, and 
he has never had more opportunities, than he has now. 
Otherwise, one cannot explain the evil of the age the 
success of mediocrity. And Sir Walter Besant knows this. 

To turn from discussion, which, be it never so charm- 
ing, is yet of less importance than facts, I have to inform 
you that there are still a few items which have escaped 
the " Notes " editor of " Literature." One is, that Mr. 
Grant Richards is busy preparing a handsome library 
edition of the novels of Jane Austen. For the present, 
this edition will consist of ten large crown octavo vol- 
umes, printed in the same type and on similar paper as 
were lavished on the " Edinburgh " edition of Steven- 
son's works. Each novel will occupy two volumes; and 
there are but five volumes " out of copyright." The 
other two, which are owned by Messrs. Bentley, must 

wait Mrs. W. K. Clifford has nearly finished a long 

novel to be published by our newest publishing house, 
Messrs. Gerald Duckworth & Co., in the summer. The 
story which Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton has had in 
type for so many years, and about which Mr. Coulson 



Kernahan has been writing lately, is at last to be issued 
to the public. I cannot say when, but it may be ex- 
pected in the autumn. The new edition of Thackeray's 
works, which Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co. have had in 
preparation for many months past, is to make its appear- 
ance shortly with " Vanity Fair," in one volume, with 
illustrations, and with an introduction by Mrs. Anne 
Thackeray Ritchie "John Oliver Hobbes " has finished 
another novel, to be issued serially in " Harper's Maga- 
zine." It is said to be an historical romance founded 
on the story of " Locrine and Gwendoline." Seven trans- 
lations and sublimations of Omar Khayyam are going 
about begging, from publisher to publisher Mr. Jer- 
ome K. Jerome is passing through the press a volume of 
essays after the style of his "Idle Thoughts of an Idle 
Fellow." We are hoping that the years of industry through 
which he has passed since the publication of that book will 
not have touched the " new humorist " to grosser influ- 
ences. M. Alphonse Daudet's last story, " The Hope of 
the Family," is to be published in its English translation 
by Messrs. C. A. Pearson. An author, unknown to 
fame, is writing a pamphlet with the following title: 
" A Proposal Humbly offered to the Ch-nc-11-r of the 
Exch-q-r, For the better regulation of the Publication 
of Books, and for bringing within modest bounds the 
pride and vanity of authors, as well as the arrogance of 
publishers." He has taken his text from Horace: 
" Insani sanas nomen ferat, sequas iniqui, 

Ultra quam satis est, virtutem si petat ipsam." 
I cannot tell you whether the tract will ever be pub- 
lished or not A new publishing house is to startle the 
world, in the autumn ; it has been feeling its way, lately, 
with a magazine called " The Dome." But " The Uni- 
corn Press " is coming on, all the same. The " New 
Vagabonds Club " is not dead yet; out of nearly three 
hundred members who forgot to pay their subscriptions, 
more than half sent their postal orders, and the Club is 
now flourishing. The rumor to the contrary was circu- 
lated by some evil-minded member, and an influential 
committee is now " sitting on " him. Fifteen hundred 
and forty-nine lady novelists have ready for the press 
three thousand and ninety-eight long stories. A well- 
known financier is busy establishing a syndicate for their 
publication, in the late autumn. Should the libraries 
refuse to subscribe, it is within the powers of the syndi- 
cate, as laid down in the articles of association, to open 
one thousand shops, in London and the provinces, for 
the sale of these novels. Our art critics are busy buy- 
ing new steel pens, to be ready for use when the Royal 
Academy opens its exhibition this spring. They have 
been busy with other matters lately, and only found time 
to abuse old masters Since the publication of " Liter- 
ature " there has been issued but one other periodical 
devoted to books, the " Journal " of the Bootle Free 
Public Library. If yon cannot find Bootle on the map, 
I can only say your map is out of date. For your bet- 
ter guidance, I may tell you that it now has a Town 
Hall of its own, and the mayor is not borrowed from 
Liverpool. Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole has written an 
introduction to the new copyright edition of Sir Richard 
Burton's " Pilgrimage to Meccah," to be published by 
Messrs. George Bell & Sons. Mr. H. G. Wells is too 
busy anent the new university for London; but he will 
not fail to have a new novel ready later in the year. 
Mr. Copinger, the late President of the English Biblio- 
graphical Society, has just issued the second volume of 
his supplement to Hain's " Repertorium." It is not 
stated that the Government will present him with an

illuminated address; but if ever a bibliographer deserved 
canonization, Mr. Copinger is that bibliographer. The 
Clarendon Press is still busy publishing books that every- 
one wants and nobody buys. The Cambridge Press is 
busy doing likewise, except that it has issued, in thirteen 
mighty quarto volumes, the papers of the late Dr. Cayley, 
a work, of course, which nobody could buy, try as he 
would. We have had a little talk about The Ballad 
of Reading Gaol," by " C. 33," and it is likely to lead 
to some sort of prison reform. A great many of us 
think it good poetry; a great many others say it is not 

art; the rest have not read it 1 hear strange rumors 

about the poet laureate being engaged on an ode on the 
new bacon and tea company, " Liptons." There may be 
something in it; for Mr. T. P. O'Connor, in " The 
Weekly Sun," says that " Liptons " is the one topic of 
conversation in the best drawing-rooms of the West End: 
and he ought to know. The celebration, this year, of 
the '98 movement in Ireland is to be a mighty fine affair, 
and we are to have reprints and new books galore on 
the subject. The committee of management in Dublin 
is busy arranging and organizing and disagreeing on the 
details and with each other, most delightfully; but you 
can be sure of this: that the visitors here, from your 
side of the water, will have a good time next May. 
There is to be a fine and handsome collected edition of 
the novels of Sheridan LeFanu, a writer who deserves 
more than he ever got. The publishers are to be Downey 
& Co., the firm which is issuing the illustrated edition 
of Lever's novels and the American translation of Bal- 
zac's "La Come"die Humaine." Mr. Sidney Lee's ad- 
mirable biography of Shakespeare as printed in the 
" Dictionary of National Biography " is to be reissued in 
separate form, as was Mr. Henley's essay on Burns. 
Mr. Max Beerbohm is going out to the Caucasus Moun- 
tains to rescue Prometheus. He has been reading the 
matter up very carefully lately, and he has told us all 
about it in this week's " Saturday Review." I do not 
know who is to publish the account of his journey; prob- 
ably the Royal Geographical Society. In any case, here 
is a good chance for an enterprising publisher.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



AN HONOR WORTHILY BESTOWED. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In compliance with an Act of the Legislature of 
Kansas, an admirable likeness in marble of Ex-Governor 
Robinson has lately been completed and placed in the 
college chapel of the State University at Lawrence. In 
thus honoring her first governor and the hero of the 
forces of freedom in " the times that tried men's souls," 
the State of Kansas has greatly honored herself. The 
struggle of the slave-masters for the spread of slavery 
over Kansas and the vast regions involved in the issue, 
was their last and desperate attempt at national su- 
premacy. It was their Armageddon, and they so under- 
stood it. James Buchanan was President, and Jefferson 
Davis was his Secretary of War. As the leader of the 
Free State party, Governor Robinson had to face the 
whole power of the national administration. He had to 
hold at bay the organized hordes of border ruffians 
from Missouri and other States. And the difficulties of 
his situation were still further aggravated by factional 
divisions in the Free State ranks, and the menace of rash 



and reckless leaders whose action would have invited 
destruction. But he was equal to the emergency. He 
was the Samuel Adams of the Free State cause. He 
had coolness, caution, and diplomacy, joined to perfect 
courage and an inflexible steadfastness of purpose. 
Having the great cause at heart, and loving his country 
better than he loved himself, he sought to subordinate 
all minor considerations and compose all differences of 
opinion and of policy. He had the rarest patience and 
forbearance, and the wise moderation which is born of 
self-control. He held extreme measures in check, and 
deprecated any act of folly which might place his cause 
in antagonism to the Constitution and the laws. With- 
out these qualities which he so happily combined in 
himself, it is difficult to believe that success would have 
been possible; and with them he was able to lead the 
way safely through the labyrinth of lawlessness and dis- 
order to the final triumph of liberty and peace. Not 
Kansas only, but the nation itself, should cherish his 
memory; for his work paved the way for the overthrow 
of slavery in the United States and its abolition through- 
out the civilized world. 

The bust of Governor Robinson is the work of Mr. 
Lorado Taft, the Chicago sculptor, and it was fitly 
placed in the chapel of the State University. Governor 
Robinson was one of the founders of this institution. 
He was its devoted friend and liberal helper while he 
lived, and he bequeathed to it the bulk of his large for- 
tune. He has been aptly called " the father of the Uni- 
versity," and I cannot better conclude this brief notice 
than by quoting the words of one of its regents in ac- 
cepting the bust: 

" So long as there remains on the map of the earth a spot 
called Kansas, and so long as there remains even the dimmest 
tradition that there was a long, heroic, and finally successful 
struggle there for freedom, and so long as there remains one 
stone upon another of the stately walls of this University, which 
was the apple of his eye, so long will live the name and the 
fragrant memory of Charles Robinson."

"THE PLIGHT OF THE BOOKSELLER." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your article on " The Plight of the Bookseller," in 
your issue of March 16, you say, " The statement was 
recently made that one of these [department] stores 
. . . could afford to retail an invoice of books * for the 
net cost of the bill and still leave a profit.' " Such a 
statement, if made in good faith, must have been made 
by one of the multitude who patronize the department 
stores, rather than by one familiar with their manage- 
ment. The book department conducted by these estab- 
lishments is run to make money, as much as any other 
department, and must meet its share of the expenses. 
When it is understood that an average profit of twenty- 
five per cent is required to cover the cost of doing bus- 
iness, such a statement as that quoted in your article 
will be seen in its absurdity. 

A good book man, in charge of a book department, 
with the backing of a large capital, has many advantages 
over the ordinary bookseller. The marvel is that the 
result is so insignificant. The only argument urged in 
behalf of the " book department " by the bookbuyer is 
the one of " cut prices," which you are right in saying 
"are not (with an occasional exception) cut so very 
much after all." Illiteracy and ignorance is the rule 
behind the counters, and only less frequently is it found

in front of them. It is not an atmosphere of learning, 
in spite of the tons of " literature," such as you may 
reasonably expect to find in even the humblest second- 
hand bookstall. But it is doing its work in a rude blun- 
dering way. A love for the beautiful must have been 
planted in many a heart that hungered (consciously) 
only for a bargain, and got it in a " classic " degraded 
in its outward form as a diamond would be set in brass. 

A large proportion of American book readers are un- 
educated women who rarely visit bookshops and who 
frequent dry goods stores. There is no serious side to 
their reading; it is simply a habit. They seldom have 
the set purpose of buying a book. Their wants are 
hosiery or gloves; they buy books casually. This ac- 
counts for the book department in the department store 
and defines its success. It cannot take the place of 
the book store until it changes its atmosphere, which it 
is not likely to do in the immediate future. 

The publisher has it in his power to protect the book- 
seller and the general good of the trade. Class distinc- 
tions should be abolished. By that I mean that ministers 
and teachers, who form a large percentage of the book- 
buying class, should not be offered special discounts and 
invited to purchase direct from the publisher. The 
publisher's announcement reads, " For sale by all book- 
sellers, or sent postpaid on receipt of price," etc. I 
wonder how many publishers there are who "receive 
the price " by mail from a customer living in a town 
where there is a responsible bookseller, who send the 
book so ordered by mail to the bookseller, enclose to 
him the difference between the list price and the whole- 
sale price, and request that the book be delivered to the 
person who ordered it ? I never heard of a publisher 
who did such a thing, and yet I believe such a policy 
would bring great returns to the publisher and result in 
great benefit to the bookseller. First, he would feel 
that he was the publisher's agent in a new sense. Second, 
it would enable him to know, and come in touch with, 
the local book-buying public. He could buy more intel- 
ligently, carry a larger stock with less risk, and build up 
his business to the point where it would be " a civilizing 
agency of the highest importance to the community." 

Another thing that the publisher might do to protect 
the bookseller, and benefit the general good of the 
trade, is to adhere to the old distinction between " whole- 
saler " and " retailer." The manner of disposition of 
the purchase should be considered rather than the quan- 
tity purchased. The large department store, with an 
outlet greater, perhaps, than the jobber who sells to the 
small bookseller, should not be able to buy as cheaply 
as the jobber; neither should the small bookseller pay 
more for the same book than the department store which 
sells only at retail. I think it can be successfully main-

THE BOOKSELLER AS AN EDUCATOR. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The " Book Lovers' Friend " is a term which has been 
justly applied to the bookseller, who, although he makes 
his daily bread from the profits on sales of good litera- 
ture, at the same time renders a service, not to be esti- 
mated by dollars and cents, in calling the attention of 
his customers to book treasures, new and old. He often 
stands in the place of a literary adviser, ministering 



with discrimination to the literary appetites of his cus- 
tomers. In this capacity the bookseller is a sort of 
Professor of Books; and just so long as the really 
thoughtful book-purchaser is to be found, just so long 
will there be an opportunity for the real bookseller to 
obtain a certain amount of patronage and a fair com- 
pensation for his services. If the statement in the ex- 
cellent article on " The Plight of the Bookseller," in the 
last issue of THE DIAL, that " a good bookstore, stocked 
with serious literature, and conducted by people who 
know something of the books they sell, is a civilizing 
agency of the highest importance to every community," 
be true, it ought to come about that an institution of 
such economic value will be preserved by the economic 
forces which, optimistically speaking, work for the ad- 
vancement of civilization. Of course this view of the 
matter does not give definite consolation to the book- 
seller who is struggling with present conditions. Com- 
petition in all lines of commerce results in changed 
methods, and the business of bookselling cannot be ex- 
empt from this law. CHARLES M. ROE.

ROMANCE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
(To the Editor of THIS DIAL.) 

In the interest of the romantic element in our history, 
will you allow me a word of protest against the rather 
summary fashion in which THE DIAL'S recent review of 
Miss Katharine Lee Bates's " American Literature " 
pronounces her references to the "Pocahontas yarn, 
Cotton Mather and witchcraft, and Ethan Allen at 
Ticonderoga " superficial and misleading. " Historical 
scholarship " does indeed distinguish, as Miss Bates has 
done, between Smith's first allusion to Pocahontas, given 
in the " True Relation " (1608), and the account of her 
kind offices to the Colonists which he gave to Queen 
Anne in 1616. Mr. Henry Adams, Mr. Henry Cabot 
Lodge, and Mr. Alexander Bruce have followed Dean in 
regarding the tomahawk of Powhatan and his daugh- 
ter's entreaties as a picturesque embellishment; but 
Smith has stanch defenders in Mr. William Wirt Henry, 
Prof. John Fiske, and Mr. Edward Aber. The charge 
of falsehood should always be coupled with the narra- 
tor's own assertion that the plea for Pocahontas might 
have been presented from a " more worthy pen," but not 
from " a more honest heart." 

As to Cotton Mather's share in the witchcraft delu- 
sion, one has but to read his own " Memorable Provi- 
dences " or " Wonders of the Invisible World " to con- 
clude with Dr. W. F. Poole, who contributed the chapter 
on witchcraft in Boston to Winsor's "Narrative and 
Critical History of America," that Mather "never 
wavered from a full belief in the reality of witchcraft 
and diabolical possession," although " his mind was 
greatly perplexed as to the nature and meaning of the 
phenomena." 

Ethan Allen's part in the taking of Ticonderoga may 
have been exaggerated by his biographers, but for the 
authenticity of his famous summons to surrender, quoted 
by Miss Bates, we have no less a witness than his own 
account of the expedition, printed in 1775. 

Fortunately for those of us who believe in "enter- 
taining" text-books, historical research is not always 
iconoclastic, and reference to the sources of our early 
history may often prove that truth is even more pictur- 
esque than fiction. KATHARINE COMAN.

FRANCE : THE STUDY OF A NATION.* 

Mr. Bodley's " France " is the most import- 
ant and suggestive work of its class that has 
appeared since the publication of Mr. Bryce's 
" American Commonwealth." In it the author 
essays to do for the student of political France 
what Mr. Bryce did for the student of political 
America ; and of his pronounced success in the 
essential part of this needed undertaking there 
can be no question. He has enriched political 
literature with an admirable specimen of insti- 
tutional exposition a scholarly product of un- 
stinted labor and thorough execution that must 
command the respect even of those least inclined 
to sympathize with certain fundamental predi- 
lections of its author. Mr. Bodley's treatment 
of his subject is a mean between the contrary 
methods of his famous predecessors, Arthur 
Young and De Tocqueville, whose respective 
masterpieces serve to exhibit the fundamental 
diversity of the aptitudes and tendencies of the 
Anglo-Saxon and the Gallic mind. Of the turn 
for generalization, for detecting the latent 
strand of connecting principle between facts 
seemingly disparate, so eminently displayed by 
the philosophic Frenchman, Mr. Bodley's pages 
evince no inconsiderable share ; while they are 
also lit and vivified at intervals by pictures of 
men and manners such as form the staple of 
the English traveller's immortal roving diary. 
The keen-eyed and practical " Suffolk Squire " 
might himself have written the following pass- 
age, for instance, illustrative of the prevailing 
indifference of the French nation to politics 
and politicians an indifference, be it said, 
that not infrequently borders on contempt, and 
finds its counterpart in most democratically 
governed countries of to-day. 

" It was the home and workshop of a wood-carver, 
whose skill, famed through the region, had long dis- 
pensed him the need for manual toil, which he loved 
with the zeal of a craftsman of old. This simple pro- 
vincial family composed a characteristic French group, 
the head of it grown grey in intelligent labor; his wife 
vigorous and orderly, keeping the books as well as the 
house; his daughter, comely as was her mother before 
the War, lately married to a young cultivator of the 
neighborhood, also present, who had completed his mil- 
itary service. This room full of contented people con- 
tained the materials that promote the prosperity and 
real glory of France industry, thrift, family sentiment, 
artistic instinct, cultivation of the soil, cheerful per- 
formance of patriotic duty, and collaboration of women

in the plan of life, all impregnated with an air of the 
old Latin civilization, oftener manifest in humble spheres 
than in the class which ought longest to have preserved 
it. Wishing to learn something of the political tenden- 
cies of the district, I asked about the rumored retire- 
ment of the deputy; but my inquiry only elicited the 
phrase, often and often repeated to me since then, Je 
ne m'occupe pas de politique, Monsieur.' When the old 
man said this, there was no anger nor scorn in his tone, 
such as a reference to the Government of France called 
forth from the occupants of the neighboring chateau 
which I had left that morning. The members of this 
worthy family had no ill-will for the Republic, nor 
indeed for any regime which allowed them to pursue 
their callings tranquilly; but politics were not to them 
an occupation for steady and industrious people."* 

Mr. Bodley's book is the fruit of a seven 
years' sojourn in France, the whole of which 
period was spent in preparation. Though not 
free from occasional Gallicisms and perhaps 
hardly avoidable adaptations from current con- 
tinental political writing, the style is in general 
no less admirable than the matter. One gets, 
too, an impression of a certain studied elegance 
that recalls by contrast the almost colloquial 
plainness of Mr. Bryce, who with an abund- 
ance of political philosophy never affects the 
political philosopher. But Mr. Bodley's mean- 
ing is always clear. In fact, we think it would 
be difficult to name a half-dozen political studies 
of its class and importance that can be read 
through so easily and continuously, we may add 
so pleasurably, as this one. 

Mr. Bodley indulges pretty freely in politico- 
historical reflections (at times rather question- 
able ones, as it seems to us), and his opening 
volume is largely an inquiry into the relations 
of modern France with the Revolution. The 
lengthy Introduction is mainly devoted to a 
general consideration of this topic, after which 
the writer proceeds to appraise and define the 
Revolution, and to exhibit the fate in France 
to-day of the ground ideas and fundamental 
maxims which the apostles of that movement 
proclaimed amid such unbounded hope and 
enthusiasm. What, for instance, is the stand- 
ing under the Third Republic of the grandiose 
motto of the first one : " Liberty, Equality, 
Fraternity " ? Is the Frenchman under M. 
Felix Faure free comparatively uninterf ered 
with by his government, and does he prize his 
freedom? Is he contentedly "as good as," 
and no better than, his neighbor? Is he, in 
any considerable humanly attainable degree, 
his neighbor's brother ? To this triple inquiry 

*The idea meant to be conveyed by the above passage was 
tersely expressed in the Assembly, in 1875, by M. Laboulaye : 
" We present the spectacle of a tranquil people with agitated 
legislators."

THE DIAL

Mr. Bodley devotes three searching and rather 
ironical chapters, with the last of which Book I. 
closes. In Book II., which concludes the open- 
ing volume, the author begins the more directly 
descriptive portion of his work, under the 
chapter-headings " The Constitution," " The 
Chief of the State." Volume II. is devoted to 
" The Parliamentary System," including " The 
Upper Chamber," " The Chamber of Deputies 
and the Electoral System," " The Composition 
of the Chamber of Deputies," " Parliamentary 
Procedure and Practice," " Ministers, Minis- 
tries, and the Parliamentary System," " Cor- 
ruption under the Republic," and to " Political 
Parties," including "The Group System," 
" The Royalists," " The Plebiscitary Element," 
" The Rallies," " The Left Centre," " The Op- 
portunists," "The Radicals," "The Socialist 
Group." Incidentally the author touches briefly 
upon a variety of topics germane to the main 
inquiry, such as political indifference, the de- 
cadence of parliament, corrupt practices, min- 
isterial instability, Republican morals, the 
army, the Panama scandals, and so on. 

Mr. Bodley's tone, we may say at once, is 
somewhat reactionary throughout, and indicates 
anything but an abiding faith in the endurance 
of the parliamentary system established by the 
Constitution of 1875. It is in the union of 
this later system with the older Napoleonic 
fabric of close-knit centralization that he sees 
the potent cause of the pessimism of French 
political writers. Infected himself, perhaps, by 
this pessimism, Mr. Bodley is of the discour- 
aging opinion that the only hope of an improved 
state of things for France lies in the prospect 
of the voice of the nation delegating its powers 
to an authoritative hand instead of to parlia- 
mentary government a prospect which, one 
would think, the memory of Sedan must serve 
to render somewhat less seductive to the French 
imagination. The proneness of Frenchmen to 
the saving course indicated by Mr. Bodley is 
amply attested by history, and there is perhaps 
in the Celtic nature an inveterate yearning for 
a leader ; but we cannot but think that every 
additional year of the life of the Third Republic 
adds to its chances of permanency, and lessens 
the likelihood that the French, captivated anew 
by some strong or showy personality, or yield- 
ing again to the spell of a name, will once more 
vote away their hard-won privilege of having, 
when they choose to exercise it, the controlling 
voice in the management of their own concerns. 
Indifference to politics, of which Mr. Bodley 
makes so much, is by no means (as we know in 



this country) necessarily a sign of indifference 
to liberty and latent preference for authorita- 
tive rule. It is the sense of freedom, the knowl- 
edge that one can have one's say when one 
chooses, that counts for most with most men ; 
and the outwardly apathetic citizen who does 
not take the trouble to cast his vote twice in a 
decade may nevertheless willingly face death in 
defence of his right to cast it, if that right be 
seriously threatened. Unless French humanity 
is radically different from humanity in general, 
each generation that grows up in France under 
the Republican regime is on the whole less 
likely than its predecessor to relapse willingly 
into a sheep-like submission to an autocrat 
even though he prove to be the bon tyran of 
Renan's optimistic dreams. The possibility of 
a despotism resting on a plebiscite grows re- 
moter, as the French character loses by degrees 
the impress of the mould of centuries of arbi- 
trary local and central rule. French republi- 
canism may perhaps again suffer a partial 
eclipse ; but it is our conviction that it will 
emerge from the shadow undimmed as before, 
and that the class represented by Mr. Bodley's 
indifferent wood-carver (whose incivisme might 
well have cost him his head in the fiery days of 
'93) will become in time as proof as its Amer- 
ican counterpart against the snares and seduc- 
tions of a Louis Napoleon or a Boulanger. 

With Mr. Bodley's view of the French Revo- 
lution we do not, in the main, find ourselves in 
sympathy. Accepting almost unqualifiedly 
Taine's view of that movement, he quotes with 
implied approval these strangely uncharacter- 
istic words of Ren an : 

" If we turn away from the grandiose fatality of the 
Revolution, all that is left is odious and horrible : a 
nameless orgie, a monstrous fray into which madmen, 
incapables, and miscreants rush, told by their instinct 
that their opportunity is come, and that victory is for 
the most repulsive of mankind. Every crime and every 
insanity seem to have united to produce the success of 
the Days of Revolution." 

Those who condemn the Revolution are in 
general given to " turning away " in their ap- 
praisals of it from all but its bloody episodes 
and wild sectaries, much as writers hostile to 
the Reformation incline to " turn away " from 
Luther and fix their eyes firmly on John of 
Leyden and the Munster Anabaptists. It is to 
be regretted that Mr. Bodley has steeped his 
mind in Taine, to the exclusion of such modi- 
fying influences as the sane and judicial Mig- 
net, or, better still, the clear and literal narra- 
tive of the latest considerable historian of the 
French Revolution, Professor Morse Stephens. 



224 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



Owing his conceptions mainly to the source 
indicated, Mr. Bodley's reflections touching the 
Revolution are sometimes impaired by the as- 
sumption that the violent and sanguinary course 
of the movement in its later phases was wholly 
or essentially due to something inherent in its 
nature or to the depravity or the incapacity of 
its leaders, whereas it was in fact largely, and 
we believe mainly, external danger, real or 
fancied, and internal dissension, that forced 
upon France the iron despotism and ruthless 
policy of the Terror. It is difficult to set a 
limit to the right of self-defence ; and when the 
infant Republic, charged, as its votaries firmly 
believed, with the highest hopes, not of France 
alone, but of humanity, found itself threatened 
by treachery and invasion without and by an- 
archy and treachery within, it threw to the 
winds its benign theories, suspended its free 
constitution, and turned France into an armed 
camp, in the midst of which it erected, as a 
grim monitor to all who might be tempted to 
swerve a hair's breadth from the paths drawn 
in accordance with the new ideals, the guillo- 
tine. In fixing the responsibility for the blood 
shed by the Republic in its hour of peril, the 
share therein of reactionary Europe, of the 
recusant priests and the emigres, must not be 
forgotten. 

Mr. Bodley finds that " the peculiar harsh- 
ness of Frenchmen to Frenchmen in their po- 
litical capacity dates from the Revolution." 
From what, then, we may ask, dated the pecu- 
liar harshness of Frenchmen to Frenchmen 
during the Revolution ? In the same vein he 
moralizes on the psychological results of the 
daily spectacle of the guillotine at work, and 
animadverts (not very profoundly) on ."a 
humanitarian philosophy " that " led to such 
depths of inhuman ferocity that to see unfor- 
tunates sent to execution was a spectacle to 
which the mothers of Paris brought their chil- 
dren." Does Mr. Bodley seriously mean to tell 
us that the gloating joy of the hags who knitted 
in the red shadow of the guillotine was born of 
that " humanitarian philosophy " not the least 
of whose titles to respect is that it raised its 
voice in fearless protest against the barbarities 
of the ancient criminal law of France ? A mo- 
ment's reflection must have reminded him that 
it was the Old Regime, and not the Republic, 
that bred in the French populace a taste for these 
bloody spectacles. To the older habitues of the 
Place de la Revolution, the Republican trage- 
dies enacted thereon must have seemed compar- 
atively tame and spiritless, when they remem- 



bered the prolonged agonies of victims of the 
wheel or the stake. Before the " humanitarian 
philosophy " at which it is the fashion nowa- 
days to sneer did away with it, the wheel was 
set up regularly in the principal cities of France, 
and the voice of the crier was heard in the 
streets as he hawked pamphlets announcing the 
fate of the victims. 

" The common people crowded about the scaffold, 
and the rich did not always scorn to hire windows over- 
looking the scene. The condemned man was first 
stretched upon a cross and struck by the executioner 
eleven times with an iron bar, every stroke breaking a 
bone. The poor wretch was then laid on his back on a 
cart-wheel, his broken bones protruding through his 
flesh, his head hanging, his brow dripping bloody sweat, 
and left to die. A priest muttered religious consolation 
by his side. By such sights as these was the populace 
of the French cities trained to enjoy the far less inhu- 
man spectacle of the guillotine." * 

Madame Roland, as a girl, was once startled 
from her books by the trampling of an excited 
mob hastening on its way to the Place de la 
Greve, where two youths were to suffer death 
by the wheel and the stake. People were crowd- 
ing to the house-tops to view the appalling 
spectacle. The future republican, though a 
true daughter of the Seine, shrank from the 
hideous sight ; but she could not shut out the 
shrieks of the victims nor the smell of the burn- 
ing faggots. The cries of one of the wretches, 
who lived for twelve hours on the wheel, rang 
in her ears throughout the night. She writes 
in her Memoirs : 

" In truth, human nature is not at all estimable con- 
sidered en masse. I cannot conceive what can thus 
excite the curiosity of thousands to see two of their 
fellow-creatures die. . . . Yes, the pitiless mob ap- 
plauded the tortures of the criminals as if at a play." 

And the same pitiless mob was one day to 
follow, with jeers and plaudits and greedy an- 
ticipation, the tumbril which bore her to the 
scaffold a serene and shining figure that will 
not soon die in the memory of that " Impartial 
Posterity " to which she made her final appeal. 
The antipathy for the French Revolution of a 
conservative, somewhat prosaic, Englishman, 
imbued with a lingering notion of the sacro- 
sanct character of throne and altar and pre- 
scriptive titles, is not unintelligible ; but we 
confess we do not understand how a French- 
man endowed with a grain of patriotism and a 
scintilla of sympathy with human progress can 
in cool blood stigmatize as a " nameless orgie " 
of " madmen, miscreants, and incapables " the

great movement that lightened the burdens and 
confirmed the civic manhood of two-thirds of 
his countrymen. The French Revolution was 
assuredly not made, as Danton said, " with 
rosewater." Those who extol it most deplore 
its follies and excesses. But had the good it 
wrought been confined to its sweeping away of 
fiscal inequalities alone, it would not be with- 
out a fair title to the respect of posterity. 

To the faint-hearted believer in representa- 
tive democracy, Mr. Bodley's view of the pres- 
ent attitude of the French towards the terms 
of the republican device, " Liberty, Equality, 
and Fraternity," will prove somewhat discour- 
aging almost as much so as Mr. Lecky's recent 
lugubrious reflections on the decline of parlia- 
mentarism in general. Whatever may be its 
faults, we do not see how anything but parlia- 
mentarism is possible now for that portion of 
the world that has grown up to it. It is hardly 
conceivable that any intelligent people that has 
for long exercised the adult privilege of vot- 
ing its own taxes, speaking its own mind, and 
generally controlling its own business, could, 
under normal conditions and in the absence of 
national decay, suddenly develop a taste for the 
infantile leading-strings of absolutism. It is 
fair to say that Mr. Bodley's ideal system for 
France is, not absolutism pure and simple, 
but a hybrid compound of Imperialism and 
Parliamentarism, an arrangement symbolized 
by certain beautiful gold coins bearing the 
revolutionary date " An. XII.," which show on 
one face the legend " Napoleon Empereur," 
and on the reverse "Republique Fran9aise." 
Of the instability of the present Republic, or 
at least of its slight hold on the people, Mr. 
Bodley finds signs and symptoms not a few. 
The indifference, bordering on contempt, of 
the bulk of the French for their legislators, we 
have already noted. But was there ever a gov- 
ernment in France of which the industrial 
masses took much note except, indeed, when 
it became especially bad ? The phenomenon 
of political indifferentism is, we venture to say, 
as common in America as in France. Had Mr. 
Bodley visited us and questioned people of the 
order of his French wood-carver as to their con- 
gressman, he would unquestionably in many 
cases have received a reply (seasoned at times 
with a robust expletive or two) equivalent to "Je 
ne rn'occupepas depolitique, Monsieur." But 
he would have been quite wrong had he inferred 
from this that events were justifying Jefferson's 
dread of " monocracy," and that a King or an 
Emperor of the United States was a looming 



political possibility. Again, Mr. Bodley lays 
stress on the unabated thirst of the French for 
orders and decorations and especially on their 
unwarranted assumption of nobiliary titles, a 
practice which has grown to such a pitch lat- 
terly that dubious counts and barons are as 
thick at Paris (we trust American heiresses will 
take note of this) as leaves in Vallombrosa, or as 
civilian " Colonels " in Kentucky and titular 
" Squires " and " Judges " in old New England. 
Mr. Bodley deals frankly yet tactfully with 
what he deems the especially noteworthy and 
suggestive faults and follies of the time. An 
unpleasant trait of the Republic is its not infre- 
quent manifestation of intolerance, notably the 
scandalous readiness of certain soi-disant offi- 
cial upholders of free thought to borrow a leaf 
from the book of its one time oppressors by 
attempting to penalize religious observances 
and to set up irreligion as a standard of citi- 
zenship. Clearly, the repressions and hatreds 
of the old regime have cast a still lingering 
shadow on the new. Mr. Bodley deplores the 
levity of that largely ornamental class which 
rejoices in the imperfectly deserved title of " la 
haute societe Parisienne " its abstention from 
public affairs and serious interests of any kind, 
its severance from the class dignified by intel- 
lect and achievement, its ape-like mimicry of 
English ways, its seeming effort to transform 
Paris into a mere cosmopolitan city of pleasure 
and common casino of nations. As M. Anatole 
Leroy-Beaulieu still more harshly puts it : 

" Les hautes classes sout inconsciemment les grands fan teurs 
da socialisme. Lear vie est one predication centre la socie'te*. 
La frivolit^ impertinente de la jeunesse de nos salons, 1'oisivete' 
ridiculement affaire'e de nos ' sportsmen ' et de nos ' clubmen,' 
I'e'talage outrageant de la debauche e'le'gante, quelles lemons 
poor le pen pie de la roe ! " 

It is the people of the provinces who, with their 
silent, sober energy, constitute the real saving 
force of France, and keep her in the front rank 
of nations, in spite of the follies committed in 
her beautiful capital. And apart from the 
mass of the people, with their excellent quali- 
ties of stability and diligence, there are, thinks 
the author, " three great but dissimilar bodies 
in the nation, the virtues of which counterbal- 
ance the ill done by the conspicuous classes 
whose words and deeds fill the newspapers." 
These are the Army, the University, and the 
Clergy. 

On the topic of the comparatively low birth- 
rate in France, the author touches in a rather 
incidental and cursory way. To a philosophic 
observer it might seem a little odd that a coun- 
try which has fairly attained that millennial

state pictured by Malthusian economists in 
which prudential checks on population effectu- 
ally prevent the pressure of numbers on the 
means of subsistence, should on that account be 
an object of such general commiseration and 
dismal prophecy. The Napoleonic view that 
places first among the national virtues the 
rapid propagation of food for powder evidently 
survives. 

Mr. Bodley's book is less comprehensive than 
Mr. Bryce's, in that it by no means covers the 
whole field of government. Dwelling exten- 
sively, in his opening volume, on historical 
relations, he has thought best to limit the scope 
of the remainder of the work to an account of 
the Executive and Legislative powers which 
have operated during the last quarter of the 
century, reserving for a future and independent 
volume a study of the jurisdictions of the great 
interior departments of the State, which in 
France survive revolutions and changes of 
regime. Thus, the promised volume will deal 
with the Centralized Adm inistration, the Church 
and Education, the Judicial and Fiscal Sys- 
tems, and with questions relating to Capital 
and Labor, to the Colonies and the Army. 
Mr. Bodley's book may safely be pronounced 
the book of the season, and it should be in the 
hands of everyone desiring a scholarlike knowl- 
edge of political France of to-day. E. G. J. 



HENRY GEORGE AND HIS FINAL, WORK.* 

Henry George died fighting one of the most 
corrupt political organizations of the civilized 
world a sufficient epitaph for any worthy 
man. But he has larger claims to respect and 
consideration. He made a creditable attempt 
to solve the root-problem of material life 
poverty, and his just-published posthumous 
book, " The Science of Political Economy," 
excites that pathetic interest which attaches to 
the memory of one who tried to aid his fellow- 
man. He was eloquent, but he was free from 
the hysteria of demagogy. His sympathies, 
born of bitter vicissitude, were acute, but they 
were tempered with reason. He believed in 
the equality of opportunity ; but he believed 
also (as an American and an individualist) in 
the natural inequality of capacity. When he 
saw the industrial evils of the Old World re- 
appear in one of the richest and fairest parts of 
the New commercial depression, involuntary

idleness, wasting capital, pecuniary distress, 
want, suffering, anxiety, he was startled, and 
he set about to discover the cause. We value 
him for what he tried to do. " Progress and 
Poverty " was an immensely interesting and 
attractive book on a seemingly sapless science. 
It struck fire from flint, and lifted the author 
from obscurity to world-wide celebrity. Emer- 
son says that every man is eloquent in that 
which he understands. It would be, perhaps, 
truer to say that every man is eloquent in that 
in which he fervently believes, and George be- 
lieved that he had given a message. To quote 
his own words : " On the night on which I 
finished the final chapter of ' Progress and 
Poverty,' I felt that the talent entrusted to me 
had been accounted for was more fully satis- 
fied, more deeply grateful, than if all the King- 
doms of the earth had been laid at my feet." 
No one doubts his sincerity, his intellectual 
integrity, the cleanliness of his soul. His ex- 
pectations were infinite, his faith simple. The 
poverty of the world lay not in Nature but in a 
vicious economic system ; and he thought that 
he had found a " sovereign remedy " which 
would " raise wages, increase the earnings of 
capital, extirpate pauperism, abolish poverty, 
give remunerative employment to whoever 
wishes it, afford free scope to human powers, 
lessen crime, elevate morals and taste and intel- 
ligence, purify government, and carry civiliza- 
tion to yet nobler heights." 

This was, of course, fatuity. His suggestion 
of the confiscation of all ground-rent, as a uni- 
versal corrective and solvent, has been thor- 
oughly discredited by political economists ; and 
he felt this fact keenly. The assent of the 
unthinking multitude did not satisfy him. He 
craved recognition from the technically in- 
structed, and this doubtless is the inspiration 
of his posthumous work. He complains that : 
" While a few of these professional economists, driven 
to say something about ' Progress and Poverty,' resorted 
to misrepresentation, the majority preferred to rely upon 
their official positions, in which they were secure by the 
interests of the dominant class, and to treat as beneath 
contempt a book circulated by thousands in the three 
great English-speaking countries and translated into all 
the important modern languages. Thus the professors 
of political economy seemingly rejected the simple 
teachings of ' Progress and Poverty,' refrained from 
meeting with disproof or argument what it had laid 
down, and treated it with contemptuous silence." 

Wishing to justify himself to the specialist, 
he embraced the mistake of an elaborate, formal 
treatise on " The Science of Political Econ- 
omy." A duller work has not appeared within 
a year and a day. We look in vain for the

dramatic instinct which characterized the com- 
position of " Progress and Poverty." No two 
books written on the same subject and by the 
same hand could be more dissimilar. And yet 
the last book is merely a repetition of the first 
in the sense that it embodies no new important 
principle. John Morley says in the preface to 
his smaller Burke : " A man may once say a 
thing as he would have it said he cannot say 
it twice." 

In this book Henry George reiterates that 
land is not wealth ; that agriculture is not sub- 
ject to the law of diminishing return ; that 
Malthusianism is infatuated pessimism ; that 
industry is not limited by capital ; that wages 
are paid out of the current product, and not 
out of capital ; that, therefore, wages cannot be 
diminished by the increase of laborers ; that 
wages are low where rent is high ; that rent 
tends to absorb all profit, and should be con- 
fiscated as an " unearned increment." All of 
which " Progress and Poverty " to the con- 
trary notwithstanding still await demonstra- 
tion. In his last work, he reserved the elabora- 
tion of nearly all these propositions to Book IV., 
part of which remains unwritten. 

He approaches the arduous task of compre- 
hensive definition with simplicity of confidence. 
He is impatient with the mistakes of his prede- 
cessors, and he enters into the usual wrangle 
over terminology. When John Stuart Mill said 
that everyone has a notion, sufficiently correct 
for common purposes, of what is meant by 
wealth, that we all know that it is one thing to 
be rich and another thing to be enlightened, 
brave, or humane, he was hooted for his want 
of precision. He was even heretical enough to 
say : Whether the skill of a workman or any 
other natural or acquired power of body or 
mind shall be called wealth, is a question not 
of very great importance. This " slovenliness 
of thought " made the pedants gasp, and lo ! 
and now Marshall has reformed it altogether. 
In passing, George takes a hit at him, which 
appeals to the American sense of humor. He 
ridicules his 

"Occasional bursts of such thunderous sound as 'external- 
material-transferable goods,' ' internal-non-transferable 
goods,' 'material-external-non-transferable goods,' and 
personal-external-transferable goods,' with all their 
respective singulars. There is in English no singular 
for the word ' goods,' and the reason is that there is 
no need for one, since when we want to express the idea 
of a single item or article in a lot of goods, it is better 
to use the specific noun." 

George endeavors to identify the laws of 
political economy with Nature, and this is not 



difficult, because everything that exists or hap- 
pens is natural. The primary postulate is not 
selfishness, but it is that men seek to gratify 
their desires with the least exertion. The sci- 
ence of political economy is concerned, he says, 
with the permanent, not with the transient. It 
deals not with human enactments or municipal 
laws, but natural laws, and has no more refer- 
ence to political divisions than have the laws 
of mechanics, optics, or gravitation. Is this 
true ? Would not the advent of Bellamy ism, 
and the consequent abolition of competition, 
exchange, and money, make modern political 
economy a hieroglyph ? 

George excludes land as wealth under the 
following definition : " Wealth consists of nat- 
ural products that have been secured, moved, 
combined, separated, or in other ways modified 
by human exertion so as to fit them for the 
gratification of human desires." But surely 
land is modified, improved, or exhausted by 
human labor ; the physical possession of it is 
transferable, it has value in exchange, and may 
be sold for the products of human labor. Why, 
then, is it not wealth ? Every business man 
knows that it is. Properly considered, the sci- 
ence of political economy, like the science of 
astronomy, is an observation and analysis of 
what is, not of what conceivably might be. It 
is not an ethical precept, and the failure to 
recognize this vitiates George's whole treatise. 

He attacks the law of diminishing return in 
agriculture (although afterwards he bases his 
whole doctrine of rent upon it), on the ground 
that it is not benevolent. But Nature is not 
benevolent ; else why should a half million of 
people have died of starvation in India last 
year ? Why is everyone born under a death 
sentence ? Even if space permitted, it would be 
tedious and profitless to follow him in detailed 
criticism through his theory of value ; his falla- 
cious analogies in physical science and pseudo- 
metaphysics ; his laborious explication of nat- 
uralism. The reader himself will look into the 
book if he deems it worth while. But, save a 
chapter on money, which is a remarkably lucid 
account of fiatism, it would seem hardly worth 
while. 

It is interesting to note that George disa- 
vowed socialism. " It takes no account of 
natural laws, neither seeking them nor striving 
to be governed by them. . . . It is a proposi- 
tion to bring back mankind to the socialism of 
Peru." And yet George's scheme of rent con- 
fiscation leads straight to socialism. It is incon- 
ceivable that four million and a half of farmers 



228

in the United States, not to speak of city house- 
holders, could be dispossessed of title without 
retaliating. What would be done with the 
mortgages on the farms ? Would the farmer 
be compelled to pay them ? Would the State 
assume them, or would it confiscate them ? Is 
there not an unearned increment in railway 
shares, wages, professional fees, and all material 
personal property ? Wherein, too, in the realm 
of absolute ethics, is the title of a nation better 
than that of an individual? It is founded on 
discovery, conquest, or purchase, and is main- 
tained by force. Assuming that there is a land 
question in a country of limited area, such as 
Great Britain, an equal division of agricultural 
and ground rent together, apart from the inter- 
est on capital invested, would give to each per- 
son there about one dollar a month. Would 
that abolish poverty ? 

In George's second book, " Social Problems," 
he hints at the confiscation of the national debt. 
He asks if the pecuniary obligations of one's 
great-grandfather should bind posterity. Once 
admit the principle of confiscation, it grows won- 
derfully. In a debate with Hyndman, the En- 
glish socialist, George said: "I can understand 
how a society must at some time become possible 
in which all production and exchange should be 
carried on under public supervision and for the 
public benefit, but I do not think it possible to 
attain that step at one leap, or to attain it now." 
Nevertheless, he helped to blaze the way to it. 
But alas for human nature and for the dream 
of the socialist ! There is one place in this im- 
perfect world of ours and perhaps only one 

where life is serious and well-ordered, where 
absolute equality prevails, where production is 
regulated and labor and reward are evenly ap- 
portioned, where men live in accordance with 
the law of wholesome average and hygiene, 
where they rise early and retire seasonably, 
where they wear warm and sufficient but not 
superfine clothing, where they work eight hours 
a day, where they attend religious services, 
where there is no luxurious and profitless living, 
where there is no idleness, no vice, no profan- 
ity, no dissipation, no extravagance, no money, 
no gambling, no speculation, no exchange, no 
swindling, no tricks of trade, no hunger, no 
controversy, no violence, no crimes, and no mis- 
takes, in a word, where a few men do what 
revolutionary socialists would have all men do, 

and that place is the penitentiary. 
Society is a growth, not a creation ; an or- 
ganism, not an empiricism. It cannot be made 
over by tinkering sciolists. Progress is evolu- 



tion, not revolution. Socialism is an intellectual 
vanity ; an ambitious humanitarianism dis- 
regardful of the two profoundest instincts in 
human nature, the sense of personal property 
and of personal liberty. Prediction is labori- 
ous failure ; the future cannot be pigeon-holed. 
Nicholson says of Utopias : " The imagination 
has very limited powers of construction com- 
pared with Nature ; on the one side we have a 
short span of life and a small brain, and on the 
other eternity and the universe."

THE STORY or HAWAII'S QTJEEX.* 

Freedom from the cares of state which the 
once Queen of Hawaii has of late enjoyed, has 
afforded her the opportunity of writing the story 
of her life and presenting to the American 
public, in a volume entitled " Hawaii's Story," 
her side of an oft-told tale. Descended from 
an ancient chief, a counsellor of Kamehameha I., 
the first Hawaiian monarch, the Princess Lydia 
was adopted at birth, in accordance with the 
prevailing Hawaiian custom, into the family of 
another chief. In 1862 she was married to 
General J. O. Dominis, son of an English sea- 
captain, who died during her brief reign as 
queen. She was proclaimed heir-apparent, 
Liliuokalani, by her brother King Kalakaua 
in 1877, and from that time took a deep inter- 
est in the political projects of the king, sympa- 
thizing with his efforts to aggrandize the crown. 
The death of the king in 1892 brought her to 
the throne, where she continued the policy 
which her brother had inaugurated. 

The story of her early life and education in 
a missionary family is briefly told. Of her 
musical ability she writes : 

" I scarcely remember the days when it would not 
have been possible for me to write either the words or 
the music for any occasion on which poetry or song was 
needed. To compose was as natural to me as to breathe; 
and this gift of nature, never having been suffered to 
fall into disuse, remains a source of the greatest conso- 
lation to this day. I have never numbered my compo- 
sitions, but am sure that they must run well up to the 
hundreds." 

The account of her travels through her own 
realm, the United States, and England on the 
occasion of the Queen's jubilee, is given with 
minute detail and the ingenuous pride charac- 
teristic of her race. She freely gives the pub-

lie her opinions of the rulers and statesmen of 
other lands whom she has met. 

"Mr. Gladstone has been called 'The Grand Old 
Man,' yet this thought was strongly emphasized to me 
also in the presence of Lord Salisbury. He has always 
appeared to me to be the greater man of the two. If 
his rule has been less popular and more conservative, it 
has required no less devoted patriotism and lofty abili- 
ties. I attribute the present prosperity of the British 
Empire very largely to the consummate wisdom and 
stanch loyalty of Lord Salisbury." 

She is quick to recognize with abundant per- 
sonal mention her royalist friends, and with 
even greater alertness assails her political op- 
ponents with covert allusion and insinuation. 
Quite naturally, the bitter resentment which 
she feels against those who now rule her native 
land colors her estimate of men and their mo- 
tives ; indeed, in speaking of the annexation 
treaty she says : 

" I had prepared biographical sketches and observa- 
tions upon the mental structure and character of the 
most interested advocates of this measure. They have 
not refrained from circulating the most vile and base- 
less slanders against me; and, as public men, they 
seemed to me open to public discussion. But my pub- 
lishers have flatly declined to print this matter, as pos- 
sibly it might be construed as libellous." 

Her animadversions are not, however, confined 
to recent times and the " missionary party," 
but revert to good Queen Emma, a rival can- 
didate at the time when the late dynasty in the 
person of King Kalakaua was placed upon the 
throne by the legislature. Her bias is evident 
in the treatment accorded this queen's reputed 
ancestry, and continues even to the account of 
her burial. 

By reason of the author's deep personal 
interest in the events narrated, the book can- 
not be trusted to give a complete and impartial 
account of recent Hawaiian history, especially 
of that part concerned with the long strug- 
gle between absolutism and constitutional gov- 
ernment, between the reactionary influences of 
the recent dynasty and the progressive ten- 
dencies of Anglo-Saxon civilization represented 
by the element variously known as the Amer- 
ican, missionary, and reform party. Take, for 
example, her account of the election of Kala- 
kaua in 1874. She states that his success was 
due to his popularity among the natives. This 
affair is otherwise reported by Alexander, who 
attributes his election to the active support of 
the American party, who feared the English 
sympathies of the rival candidate Queen Emma. 
The defection in the army and the police, and 
the riot which followed, are minimized by the 
queen as "not an expression of the Hawaiian 



people ; it was merely the madness of a mob 
incited by disappointed partisans whom the 
representatives of the people had rebuked." 
Alexander states that Kalakaua owed his life 
and his throne to American intervention, and 
for several years he depended upon the support 
of the foreign community. 

The queen complains that her cabinets were 
never given the test of experience, that her ap- 
pointees were invariably voted out by the legis- 
lature " for want of confidence " without just 
cause, and she regrets this unpatriotic action 
of the legislature ; but she neglects to state that 
this body was overwhelmingly Hawaiian, and 
that the occasion for these repeated rejections 
of her appointments was her persistent refusal 
to appoint men acceptable to the majority. By 
the constitution of 1887 the cabinet was respon- 
sible to the people alone, through the legis- 
lature. The queen's refusal to accede to the 
time-honored English procedure was thus the 
occasion for this " unpatriotic " action of the 
people's representatives. 

One notes with interest her account of the 
Hale Naua, or Temple of Science, a secret 
organization of Kahunas or medicine men, 
whose ritual is a travesty of Masonry mingled 
with pagan rites. It was founded by Kalakaua, 
says Alexander, partly as an agency for the 
revival of heathenism, partly to pander to vice, 
and indirectly to serve as a political machine. 
The queen's account is as follows : 

" Probably some of its forms had been taken by my 
brother from the Masonic ritual, and others may have 
been taken from the old and harmless ceremonies of the 
ancient people of the Hawaiian Islands, which were 
then only known to the priests of the highest orders. 
Under the work of this organization was embraced 
matters of science known to historians, and recognized 
by the priests of our ancient times. The society further 
held some correspondence with similar scientific asso- 
ciations in foreign lands, to whom it communicated its 
proceedings. The result was some correspondence with 
those bodies, who officially accepted the theories pro- 
pounded by the Hale Naua; and in recognition of this 
acceptance medals were sent from abroad to the mem- 
bers highest in rank in the Hawaiian Society." 

Her signature to the notorious lottery bill 
which gave the Louisiana company twenty 
years' franchise is defended by the ex-queen on 
the ground that she was compelled to sign it 
by the " bayonet " constitution, made and en- 
forced by the missionary party, which specifies 
that the sovereign shall and must sign such 
measures as the cabinet presents for signature. 
It is, however, safe to say that she spared no 
effort, political or personal, to secure, and only 
after months of contest succeeded in retaining, 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



a cabinet which would sanction such a bill. 
The champions of this, and other legislation 
of similar repute enacted at the same time, 
were and have been ardent supporters of the 
queen. She further justifies her action : " We 
were petitioned and besought to grant it by 
most of the mercantile class of the city, shop- 
keepers, mechanics, manufacturers, in fact 
all the middle class of the people." It is hardly 
necessary to state that the Chamber of Com- 
merce, and the reputable classes of society both 
native and foreign, were not included with these 
petitioners for the passage of the lottery bill. 

The queen now renounces her abdication, 
claiming that it was forced from her while a 
prisoner, by the threat that certain prominent 
citizens who had taken part in the uprising to 
restore the monarchy would be immediately 
put to death if she refused. Furthermore, the 
name which she was requested to affix to that 
document was not and never had been her legal 
signature. She also denies the accuracy of 
Minister Willis's official reports of his first 
interview with her looking toward her restora- 
tion. She says : 

" It was most unfortunate that the American minister 
should have so misrepresented me, or that I should have 
so misunderstood him, or that his stenographer (if there 
was one concealed at that interview) should have blun- 
dered, or that I should have been so overburdened by 
the many aspects of the painful situation as to be igno- 
rant or unconscious of the importance of the precise 
words read in my presence." 

Although, owing to its warped and partial 
statements, the book has little value as reliable 
history, it is nevertheless a most important 
contribution to the literature of the Hawaiian 
question. It is of interest alike to those who 
condemn and to those who condone the over- 
throw of the monarchy, for it gives an authentic 
revelation of the ex-queen's views of the rights 
and privileges of a constitutional monarch. 

Hawaii emerged from feudal barbarism in 
the early part of the present century. With 
Anglo-Saxon help and guidance, an absolute 
monarchy was established and maintained by 
the Kamehamehas. In 1840, the first consti- 
tution was granted by the king under the ad- 
vice and direction of his religious teachers. In 
1852, a new and liberal constitution, in whose 
formation the king, the supreme court, and the 
legislature shared, was ratified by the latter 
body. This continued in force until 1864, 
when Prince Lot, the first of the monarchs to 
show reactionary tendencies, promulgated a 
new constitution upon his own authority which 
slightly increased the power of the crown. This 



constitution prevailed until 1887, when the 
abuses and corruption of the government under 
Kalakaua resulted in an uprising which forced 
upon the king a new constitution that extended 
the franchise to foreigners and made the cab- 
inet responsible to the people through the leg- 
isture. To this " bayonet " constitution, the 
queen took the oath of allegiance on her acces- 
sion to the throne in 1891. Long before we 
reach the account of her own reign, we have 
no doubt as to her attitude toward this consti- 
tution which had shorn the crown of its pre- 
rogatives " which, based upon the ancient cus- 
tom and the authority of the island chiefs, were 
the sole guaranty of our nationality." Early 
in her reign, a movement for a new constitution 
received her endorsement. In her own words : 
" I assented to a modification of the existing 
constitution on the expressed wishes, not only 
of my own advisers, but of two-thirds of the 
popular vote, and, I may say it without fear of 
contradiction, of the entire population of native 
or half-native birth." The desired modifica- 
tions were not sought in the method prescribed 
by law, there was never a plebescite upon the 
subject, and her constitutional advisers, crea- 
tures of her own, to a man implored her not to 
promulgate the new constitution, and finally in 
the face of her determination fled from the 
palace. 

She further claims that the right to grant a 
constitution to the nation has been, since the 
very first one was granted, a prerogative of the 
Hawaiian sovereigns ; although in the brief 
period of Hawaiian history there is abundant 
precedent for other initiative and sanction. 
The American people will look with interest 
for the queen's version of the constitution whose 
attempted promulgation led to her overthrow, 
but they will look in vain, for the subject is 
dismissed with a few vague generalities and 
guarded allusions. 

" It is alleged that my proposed constitution was to 
make such changes as to give to the sovereign more 
power, and to the cabinet or legislature less, and that 
only subjects, in distinction from temporary residents, 
could exercise suffrage. In other words, that I was to 
restore some of the ancient rights of my people." 

This last sentence has a patriotic ring, but read in 
the light of early Hawaiian history its true char- 
acter is revealed. The queen has painted a pleas- 
ing picture of the life of the ancient chief and 
his retainers, but Cook, Ellis, and Jarvis have 
used pigments of a more sombre hue. Under 
the ancient feudal system the Hawaiian vassal 
had no rights to property, real or personal ; his 
labor, his home, and his very life itself were

subject to the whim of his chief. The subjection 
of the legislature, the cabinet, and the supreme 
court to the sovereign, and the banishment 
of the Anglo-Saxon from political life, would 
doubtless have done much to restore the spirit 
of this primitive time in the queen's realm. 

Liliuokalani's appeal to the American peo- 
ple for Hawaiian autonomy is both dignified 
and pathetic : 

" Oh, honest Americans, as Christians hear me for 
my downtrodden people ! Their form of government 
is as dear to them as yours is precious to you. Quite 
as warmly as you love your country, so they love theirs. 
With all your goodly possessions, do not covet the little 
vineyard of Naboth's, so far from your shores, lest the 
punishment of Ahab fall upon yon, if not in your day, 
in that of your children, for ' be not deceived, God is 
not mocked.' The people to whom your fathers told 
of the living God, and taught to call ' Father,' and whom 
the sons now seek to despoil and destroy, are crying 
aloud to him in their time of trouble ; and He will keep 
His promise, and will listen to the voices of His Ha- 
waiian children lamenting for their homes."

OF GREAT PHYSICIANS.* 

Of the interesting series of biographies of 
"Masters of Medicine," three have already 
issued from the press, and others are yet to 
come. Briefly yet clearly they set forth the 
principal events in the lives of the pioneers 
in medical science. Beginning with Harvey, 
we are retrograded into the sixteenth century 
to the days of Elizabeth and the Invincible 
Armada. During that period of English ex- 
pansion the future physician was born and be- 
gan his observation of nature. A few years 
later we find him, the favorite brother of a 
whole family of successful London merchants, 
enjoying all the scholastic advantages that their 
wealth could procure attending the lectures 
of the celebrated Fabricius, professor of anat- 
omy in the University of Padua, laboriously 
tracing the channels of communication between 
arteries and veins, and preparing the way for 
that demonstration of the circulation of the 
blood which, announced in after years, made 
his name forever famous in the annals of sci- 
entific discovery. Then, early in the seven- 
teenth century, we see the rising doctor, mar- 
ried, settled in London, physician to St. Bar- 
tholomew's Hospital, lecturer on anatomy at 
the College of Physicians, finally reaching the

Journal." I., William Harvey; II., John Hunter; III., Sir

exalted position of physician to His Majesty, 
King Charles the First. Between the learned 
doctor and his royal patient grew up the utmost 
confidence and cordial friendship. At the bat- 
tle of Edgehill, while the king charged upon 
the foe at the head of his cavaliers, his two 
little sons, Charles and James, sat with their 
guardian, Dr. Harvey, in the shade of a hedge 
upon the brow of the hill that overlooked the 
field of combat. When the royalists were shut 
up in Oxford, Merton College was converted 
into a residence for the queen, and Dr. Harvey 
was placed in control as master of the college. 
All through the unhappy conflict between king 
and parliament, the doctor faithfully followed 
the fortunes of his sovereign ; but when the 
war was over he returned to the peaceful occu- 
pation of his London home, where he passed 
the remainder of his life, dissecting, lecturing, 
writing, bestowing of his wealth upon the Col- 
lege of Physicians a martyr to the gout, yet 
reaching his eightieth year, and dying without 
pain after an illness of only a few hours. 

In William Harvey we trace the career of a 
learned physician, the child of fortune, the man 
of letters. In John Hunter we make acquaint- 
ance with a very different type. Born in the 
year 1728, a Scotchman, wayward, ignorant, 
quarrelsome, irreligious, in every respect an 
unsavory person, yet one of the most enthu- 
siastic students of comparative anatomy and 
physiology that ever lived, he became, through 
sheer industry and force of character, the 
founder of scientific surgery in England, and 
the leading surgeon of his day. The story of 
his gigantic labors in the formation of the mu- 
seum upon which out of his professional income 
he expended no less than three hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars, leaving his family pen- 
niless when he died, is one of the most inter- 
esting and instructive in the annals of medicine. 

In many respects the record of the life of 
Sir James Simpson forms the most attractive 
volume of this interesting series. Like Har- 
vey, Dr. Simpson was an educated gentleman 
who charmed his patients by the fascination 
of his manners, making of them friends rather 
than clients. To his experiments was due 
the introduction of chloroform as an anaes- 
thetic ; and through its use in his special line 
of practice he earned the gratitude of count- 
less mothers all over the world. The story of 
the discovery of artificial anaesthesia is well 
told in these pages, and will interest others be- 
sides members of the medical profession.

The story of the Puritans as pioneers 
in New England has been often told . 
So, too, in a lesser degree, there has 
been full recognition of the builder work done by 
Quakers in Pennsylvania and Huguenots in the 
Carolinas. Now, at last, another group of refugees, 
similar in character and purpose to Puritan and 
Quaker and Huguenot, has found its historian. The 
Rev. Sanford H. Cobb, whose residence at Richfield 
Springs, New York, has familiarized him with the 
earlier seats of this people, has made a valuable 
addition to the record of our Colonial period in his 
" Story of the Palatines " (Putnam). There are many 
students of general history who are familiar with the 
history of the devastation of the Palatinate of the 
Rhine by the armies of Louis the Fourteenth, yet are 
ignorant of what that province suffered under its 
absolutist and bigoted rulers of the next two genera- 
tions. These Palatine electors emulated that short- 
sighted French monarch's treatment of the Hugue- 
nots, and between 1708 and 1750 drove to a refuge 
in America over sixty thousand of their best subjects. 
Many a student of our Civil War who is conversant 
with the details of that great campaign beginning 
in " the Wilderness " which carried Grant to Rich- 
mond, is ignorant that its starting-point, the Ger- 
manna Ford through the Rapidan, took its name 
from a colony of these exiles for conscience' sake, 
planted in the wilds of Virginia by Governor Spots- 
wood in 1710. New Berne in North Carolina had 
become, in the previous year, the seat of another 
colony from the Palatinate, led by the Swiss gen- 
tleman Christopher de Graffenried, of the older 
Alpine Berne. But the great immigration of the 
Palatines was into New York and Pennsylvania, 
beginning in 1708, and occupying first the banks of 
the Hudson in the vicinity of the present Newburgh, 
whose name possibly enshrines a remembrance of the 
princely house of Neuberg which ruled over the Pal- 
atinate. But the Palatines were not to find a home 
on the Hudson, nor in any large numbers even 
within the colony of New York. Mr. Cobb has 
well told how the English government, and Governor 
Hunter, after doing everything possible to bring 
these afflicted people to a better land in America, 
turned upon them in their poverty, through disap- 
pointment as to economic returns which the envir- 
onment would not produce, and at last drove them 
despairing to the Indians on the Mohawk. Even 
here their sufferings did not cease. The stepfatherly 
care of the government was made more burdensome 
by the oppressions of wealthy and influential land- 
grabbers, and so in 1723 a third pilgrimage brought 
the far larger number of them to the Susquehanna 
and the Swatara. Here at last, under the Quakers, 
was freedom and kindly government ; and during 
the next twenty years that portion of Pennsylvania 
was planted directly from the Palatinate with thou- 
sands of families of sturdy and enterprising farmers 
the forefathers of the " Pennsylvania Dutch." 



Thus New York lost from her body politic a most 
valuable element, although enough remained in the 
original settlements to give America the first apostle 
of freedom of the press in John Peter Zenger, and 
to give the next generation that noble soldier of the 
Oriskany, Nicholas Herkimer. And so she lost 
Conrad Weiser and Henry Melchior Muhlenburg, 
and gave to Pennsylvania those other more famous 
Muhlenburgs, and Zollicoffer, Heintzelman, Siegel, 
and the Hartranfts. Mr. Cobb has told his story well, 
and whilst he has done justice to these worthy pio- 
neers, he has not been unmindful of the real merits 
of Governor Robert Hunter, and of his large ser- 
vices to the commonwealth where he made some sad 
mistakes. 

We have always been inclined to 
a d books called Idle Hours or 
" Dozy Hours," just as we avoid 
newspaper columns called " Saunterings " or " Gos- 
sippings." And almost everybody, we imagine, is 
inclined to avoid an essay on Pepys as instinctively 
as one avoids pronouncing that gentleman's name. 
Still, Mr. W. H. Hudson has claims to attention, 
and thus we were fortunately led to read his " Idle 
Hours in a Library " (Doxey) with more sympathy 
than we should have supposed from title or table of 
contents. All the essays are not on Pepys, to tell 
the truth, only one is ; nor are all the essays to be 
read in idle hours ; indeed (the author to the con- 
trary, however) we cannot easily regard them as 
having been written in idle hours. They are descrip- 
tive essays, it is true, and descriptive essays, as such, 
may have been written or may be read in idle hours. 
But one cannot imagine Mr. Hudson idly noting 
the points which go to make up the essay on Eliza- 
bethan England ; nor can we readily think of a 
person idly reading the essay on Mrs. Manley and 
Mrs. Behn. But we will stop what may seem little 
more than quibbling about a title ; enough if we 
make it clear that these essays are not of those dis- 
continuous ramblings, those roundabout perambu- 
lations, those familiar idlings, which begin at any 
subject that comes to mind, or rather that the mind 
comes to, and wander a happy-go-lucky course at 
the suggestion of personal association. These es- 
says are " unacademic," it is true ; but each puts 
before the reader a perfectly definite object. They 
are, we think, different in merit and in interest. The 
essay on Elizabethan England is the best, for there 
is the most in it, and it will be read with pleasure 
by idler and scholar alike. The essay on Mrs. Man- 
ley and Mrs. Behn, on the other hand, is not in sub- 
ject or in treatment such as to attract or hold an 
idle interest ; its real interest is for the student, 
although it is not put in such form as to be most 
useful to him. The essays on Pepys and on the 
Bohemia of Henri Murger are the two which come 
nearest the implication of the general title. The 
first almost led us to break a fixed resolve and read 
the famous diary, and the second made us glad we 
had already experienced the Vie de Boheme. To 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

tell the truth, essays of this character are very hard 
to write well, and even when well written they 
remind us of the saying of someone to the effect 
that " at no other period than this were there so 
many people who wanted to know about books with- 
out reading them." To such readers, certainly, 
Mr. Hudson does not address his work. Others, 
we suspect, would appreciate his critical opinions, 
and would, indeed, value them more highly than 
his descriptive reports. Mr. Hudson accomplished 
such good results when he was busy in a library 
that relatively one regrets that he allows himself 
the privilege of idling there. 

The essay on " Style " which Mr. 

^ alter Ralei g h has J Q8t Published 
in the form of a slender and taste- 
fully printed volume (Arnold) is one of the most 
remarkable pieces of critical writing that we have 
seen for many a day. The author not only has a 
great many real things to say, but he is also the 
master of a style of his own that attains high dis- 
tinction. Rather than amplify these propositions 
in the usual critical fashion, we prefer to fortify 
them by such quotations as space allows, persuaded 
that even within the present narrow limits, the book 
may be made to give adequate testimony in its own 
behalf. Here is a typically beautiful passage : 
" The mind of man is peopled, like some silent city, 
with a sleeping company of reminiscences, associa- 
tions, impressions, aptitudes, emotions, to be awak- 
ened into fierce activity at the touch of words. By 
one way or other, with a f anfaronnade of the march- 
ing trumpets, or stealthily, by noiseless passages 
and dark posterns, the troop of suggesters enters 
the citadel, to do its work within. The procession 
of beautiful sounds that is a poem passes in through 
the main gate, and forthwith the by-ways resound 
to the hurry of ghostly feet, until the small com- 
pany of adventurers is well - nigh lost and over- 
whelmed in that throng of insurgent spirits." Again, 
how fine, and at the same time how weighty, is the 
passage with which the essay closes : " Write, and 
after you have attained to some control over the 
instrument you write yourself down whether you 
will or no. There is no vice however uncon- 
scious, no virtue however shy, no touch of mean- 
ness or generosity in your character, that will not 
pass on to the paper. You anticipate the day of 
judgment and furnish the recording angel with ma- 
terial. The art of criticism in literature, so often 
decried and given a subordinate place among the 
arts, is none other than the art of reading and inter- 
preting these written evidences. Criticism has been 
popularly opposed to creation, perhaps because the 
kind of creation that it attempts is rarely achieved, 
and so the world forgets that the main business of 
Criticism, after all, is not to legislate, but to raise 
the dead. Graves, at its command, have waked 
their sleepers, oped, and let them forth. It is by 
the creative power of this art that the living man 
is reconstructed from the litter of blurred and frag- 



"For Greekt 

a blush." 



mentary paper documents that he has left to pos- 
terity." We should not know where to look for a 
finer comment than this upon the Buffonian text 
that is so generally misquoted. Nor would it be 
easier to pack more of truth into a few words than 
we find in such a passage as this : " No two words 
ever coincide throughout their whole extent. If 
sometimes good writers are found adding epithet to 
epithet for the same quality, and name to name for 
the same thing, it is because they despair of cap- 
turing their meaning at a venture, and so practice 
to get near it by a maze of approximations." We 
must close our extracts somewhere, and select for 
the purpose this solution of a vexed question : "Ac- 
cording as they endeavor to reduce letters to some 
large haven and abiding-place of civility, or prefer 
to throw in their lot with the centrifugal tendency 
and ride on the flying crest of change, are writers 
dubbed Classic or Romantic." Who has ever made 
the distinction more subtly than this, or with choicer 
turn of phrase ? Mr. Raleigh's essay deserves a 
place on the shelf by the side of Stevenson, almost 
by the side of Pater and Arnold. 

In view of the recent Graeco-Turkish 
War, Mr. W. Alison Phillips's " The 
War of Greek Independence, 1821 
to 1833," is a very timely book. The author con- 
fronts the vital problem of the future of the Balkan 
Peninsula, and asks what aid in its solution can be 
derived from the history of Greece in this century. 
One is surprised to find that Mr. Phillips still looks 
with hope to the Greeks as possible regenerators of 
the peninsula, for his entire book is a logical refu- 
tation of any such conclusion. It represents the 
Greeks as almost completely destitute of the civic 
virtues, and even more lacking in the personal 
ones. Such a vivid portrayal of lying, thieving, 
murder, outrage, assassination, treason, and at times 
cowardice, joined with a picturesque sentimentality 
and the most desperate courage, is almost without 
a parallel. In cruelty, the Greek far surpassed the 
Turk ; in treachery he was preeminent ; and the 
record of butcheries of men, women, and children, 
committed after capitulation on promise of personal 
safety, is revolting. To give one instance out of 
hundreds, we select the following from an account 
of the slaughter after Navarino, an account given 
by a Greek priest : " Women, wounded with musket 
balls, rushed into the sea, seeking to escape, and 
were deliberately shot. Mothers, robbed of their 
clothes, with infants in their arms, plunged in the 
water to conceal themselves from shame, and were 
then made a mark for inhuman riflemen. Greeks 
seized infants from their mothers' breasts and 
dashed them against the rocks. Children, three or 
four years old, were hurled living into the sea, and 
left to drown " (page 59). After this catalogue of 
horrors, the author adds : " The other atrocities of 
the Greeks, however, paled before the awful scenes 
which followed the storming of Tripolitza." The 
writer informs us that the Turks, on the contrary, 



234 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



were seldom guilty of such outrages. The Greeks, 
not satisfied with butchering the enemy, were a 
scourge to their own countrymen ; and if neither 
Turk nor peasant was at hand, these famous war- 
riors fought with each other. In fact, they did this 
in season and out of season, from the beginning to 
the end of the war. The decades that have passed 
since the struggle for independence do not seem to 
have improved the character of the Greek, if we 
may be permitted to judge from the events of the 
last war. It seems, therefore, that we are justified 
in surrendering a hope which never had a rational 
basis, the hope that with the Greek lies the welfare 
of the Balkan peninsula. This does not mean that 
the Turk is fitted to secure it. Against that, 
the centuries have decided irrevocably. The Turk 
is, indeed, just, moderate, and tolerant ; but he is a 
failure as an administrator, and his religion stands 
in the way of progress. Consequently, the question 
is as far from solution as ever. Mr. Phillips has 
consulted the best and most recent authorities, he 
writes in a delightfully clear and interesting fashion, 
and his accuracy is unimpeachable. 



Picture* of two volumes, by Mr. J. Fitzger- 

18th century aid Molloy, entitled " The Romance 

Dublin life. of the Irigh stage" (Dodd), belong to 

the class of books whose aim is to bring back actors 
who long ago strutted and fretted their hours upon 
the stage. At times we wonder if it would not be 
wiser to leave the graves of these poor mortals un- 
disturbed. In their lives, these actors, through the 
characters they impersonated, often made men nobler 
by some pregnant thought that fell from their lips, 
but, shorn of the form the dramatist gave them, and 
made to appear in their own naked selves, their 
ennobling power vanishes like the tinselled frippery 
of the theatre before the cold light of day. Only 
here and there in the course of many years is a great 
actor born, and when such a man dies, there is, to 
use Hazlitt's words, " a void produced in society, a 
gap which requires to be filled up." Let authors, 
if they will, try to fill up these gaps with their books, 
but let them remember also that it takes a very 
great actor to make a gap which it is worth while 
to fill. If anything will redeem the books before 
us from the ephemeral existence accorded to most 
works of the sort, it will in all probability be the 
vivid and varied picture they give us of the social 
life in Dublin during the eighteenth century. That 
was a time when life in the Irish capital ran high ; 
when vast crowds thronged to witness scenes of 
pomp and circumstance like the arrival of the Vice- 
roy or the procession of the Trades ; when men 
won and lost fortunes on the cock-fighting on Cork 
Hill ; when young sparks about town thought no 
more of fighting a duel than of drinking a glass of 
claret ; when the narrow streets of the city were 
filled with routs of hooting children following some 
malefactor who was being whipped, with coachmen 
and chairmen fighting for the right of way, with 
dandies and drunkards swearing and singing coarse 



songs and jostling each other about ; when robbery 
stalked abroad at midnight, and beggary was witty 
and picturesque even in her rags. It is needless to 
say that a work which reflects and reproduces such 
scenes as these is worth the reading, and it is this 
reproduction of the life of the time that made Mr. 
Molloy's work worth the writing. 

It is a difficult matter for one with 
The Campaign military training to describe a cam- 

of Sedan. / . . 

paign from a military standpoint and 
make his details clear to the non-military reader. 
That this can be done, however, is shown by Mr. 
George Hooper's " Campaign of Sedan," first pub- 
lished in 1887, and now republished in less expen- 
sive form as a volume in " Bonn's Standard Library " 
(Macmillan). The work contains an excellent state- 
ment of the condition of the armies of Prussia and 
of France previous to the outbreak of war, and em- 
phasizes Prussia's advantage at the outset in that 
she could quickly mobilize her troops. The lan- 
guage is simple yet forcible, and the story of the 
war itself is so well told that interest is sustained 
throughout ; while the maps, both of the general 
field of the war and of particular battles, make it 
possible to follow, step by step, the progress of the 
campaign. The book ends with the battle of Sedan. 
The introductory chapter, and the succeeding one 
on the causes of the war, while presented in an en- 
tertaining fashion, do not show that accurate histor- 
ical knowledge which marks the remainder of the 
book. Thus, on page 10, in a reference to the har- 
mony of Prussian statesmen on the question of war 
with Austria, the statement is made that the famous 
ministerial council of February, 1866, was unani- 
mous in the decision for war, when as a fact both 
Von Bodelschwingh, Minister of Finance, and the 
Crown Prince of Prussia, spoke and voted against 
the war. Such points, however, might easily escape 
the attention of a writer whose chief interest was in 
military affairs, and do not detract from the real 
value of the work the clear exposition of a great 
military campaign. 

When a master of any art or science 
or profession takes us into his confi- 
dence and tells us the true story of his 
life, we feel it to be a privilege to listen. In " Mar- 
chesi and Music " ( Harper) this service is rendered 
by the most famous of living teachers of the art of 
singing. In her forty-one years of professional life, 
Madame Marchesi has known nearly every promi- 
nent musician of the period, either as friend or 
as instructor. Consequently the book is full of 
most entertaining and instructive reminiscence of 
famous persons, ranging from Nicolai and Men- 
delssohn (under whose auspices she made her first 
important appearance before the public) to Mas- 
senet, Verdi, Ambroise Thomas, Humperdinck, and 
other living composers. And side by side with these 
anecdotes of celebrities, these records of artistic tri- 
umphs and brilliant public events, runs a pleasing 



1898.]

thread of personal narrative, showing the "true- 
womanly " side of the illustrious head of the Ecole 
Marches!. The glimpses of everyday life, with its 
early struggles against poverty, its thwarted aims, 
its griefs in the loss of beloved children, its simple 
fireside pleasures, and its domestic companionship, 
are as well worth noting as the more striking inci- 
dents. Thus the book has an interest for others 
beside musicians, and furnishes an excellent com- 
mentary on the words which Madame Marchesi 
announces as her " motto," " Faith, Labor, and 
Perseverence." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Volume XI. of " Book Prices Current," published in 
London by Mr. Elliot Stock, covers the auction sales 
of the year ending last November. The volume is 
larger than its predecessors, being augmented by exten- 
sive indexes, as well as by the catalogue notes demanded 
by the unusual number of scarce and valuable books 
(especially in the Ashburnham collection) sold during 
the year. The number of lots catalogued is 37,358, and 
the amount realized was 100,259, a far higher average 
price than is recorded for any previous year of the pub- 
lication. Mr. J. H. Slater is the compiler of the work, 
and gives us the comforting assurance that in book- 
buying "just at present there is no great mania to en- 
large upon." 

That noteworthy series of monographs issued under 
the name of " The Portfolio " has long occupied a 
unique and enviable position among art periodicals. In 
the literary excellence of its text, and the beauty of its 
illustrations and mechanical make-up, it is unsurpassed. 
The latest issue is an interesting and scholarly essay 
on Peter Paul Rubens, by Mr. R. A. M. Stevenson, 
author of the monograph on Velazquez, previously 
published in the same series. The illustrations accom- 
panying Mr. Stevenson's text consist of two finely- 
executed photogravures and thirty-two plates printed 
in sepia and black and white. " The Portfolio " is 
published in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

A volume on "Astronomy " is contributed to the " Con- 
cise Knowledge Library " (Appleton) by the collabora- 
tion of Miss Agnes M. Clerke with Mr. A. Fowler and 
Mr. J. El lard Gore. There are nearly six hundred 
pages, illustrated, in this "popular synopsis of astro- 
nomical knowledge to date," and the text is unusually 
readable. In this connection we may also mention "A 
New Astronomy for Beginners " (American Book Co.), 
a high school text-book by Professor David P. Todd. 
The author has had the laboratory (not the observatory) 
constantly in mind during the preparation of this book, 
and emphasizes throughout the physical aspects of the 
science. 

Encouraged, probably, by the success of their excel- 
lent " Illustrated English Library," Messrs. G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons have begun the publication of a new series 
on somewhat similar lines, which they inaugurate with 
George Borrow's " Lavengro." The type used in this 
" New Library," as it is called, is handsome and read- 
able, the paper of a good quality, the presswork well 
done, and the binding, although somewhat inartistic, is 
stout and durable. These strong points, combined with 
the popular price of one dollar per volume, should make 
the series a success. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

The " History of the Indian Mutiny," by Mr. T. Rice 
Holmes, first published in 1883, is now issued by the 
Macmillan Co, in a new (fifth) edition, thoroughly re- 
vised, and extended to a thick volume of nearly seven 
hundred pages. 

Tnrgot's " Reflections on the Formation and the Dis- 
tribution of Riches," translated and edited (we presume) 
by Professor Ashley, is published as an " Economic 
Classic " by the Macmillan Co. The original of this 
work is dated 1770. 

" The Diplomatic Relations between Cromwell and 
Charles X. Gnstavus of Sweden " is the title of a doctoral 
dissertation offered at Heidelberg by Mr. Guernsey 
Jones, and now published in pamphlet form by the State 
Journal Co., Lincoln, Nebraska. 

The Christian Literature Co. are the publishers of an 
American edition (two volumes in one) of Professor 
Max Miiller's translation of the twelve classical Upan- 
ishads, hitherto known as forming a part of the series 
called " Sacred Books of the East." 

" The Bible References of John Ruskin," compiled by 
Misses Mary and Ellen Gibbs, is a recent publication of 
the Oxford University Press. The work has been done 
with both intelligence and conscience, and the book is one 
that both Ruskinians and Bible students will find useful. 

Mr. Henry Sweet's "First Steps in Anglo-Saxon," 
published by the Oxford University Press, is an even 
more elementary book than the " Anglo-Saxon Primer " 
of the same author. An extremely simplified grammar, 
some forty pages of text for reading, and as many pages 
of notes, make up the contents of this little book. 

" The Artist," one of the best of English art period- 
icals, has recently extended its material and scope, and 
now appears in greatly enlarged form. The March issue 
contains a number of interesting articles, all of which 
are profusely illustrated. Messrs. Archibald Constable 
& Co. of London are the publishers of " The Artist." 

We have already spoken of the first two sections of 
the bibliography of " Elizabethan Translations from the 
Italian " prepared by Miss Mary Augusta Scott, and 
published by the Modern Language Association of Amer- 
ica. A third section of this work, including 111 titles 
of " miscellaneous translations," has just been issued, 
leaving but one more to appear. 

The James Russell Lowell memorial park is in danger. 
Of the $35,000 needed for the purchase of the Elmwood 
estate only about two-thirds has thus far been subscribed. 
The time of purchase has been extended to May 1, but 
if the fund is not made up by that date, the trustees 
will be forced to cut up the land into building lots, and 
the opportunity to secure Elmwood for public purposes 
will have been lost. 

The " Christmas Books," in one thick volume, and 
" The Old Curiosity Shop," in two of less generous 
dimensions, are now added to the " Gadshill " edition of 
Dickens, edited by Mr. Andrew Lang, and imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. From the same im- 
porters we also have Volumes III. and IV. of " Fred- 
erick the Great," in the dignified " Centenary " edition 
of the works of Thomas Carlyle. 

James Payn, born in 1830, died a few days ago. He 
has been for half a century an unwearying literary 
worker, producing novels, essays, and miscellaneous 
journalism, in great profusion; and will be remembered 
not for any one distinctive achievement, but rather for 



236

the varied entertainment that he has provided for two 
generations of readers. A genial temperament, much 
knowledge and industry, an agile fancy, and a wide ac- 
quaintance with men and affairs, all combined to make 
his work acceptable without bestowing upon it the least 
measure of enduring quality. He will be missed and 
mourned by a host of readers in both England and 
America. 

The " Temple " edition of the Waverley novels, im- 
ported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, is well under 
way, thirteen of the forty-eight volumes being now ready. 
In addition to the two volumes of " Waverley," pub- 
lished some time ago, we have lately received " Guy 
Mannering," " The Antiquary," " Rob Roy," " Old Mor- 
tality," and " The Heart of Midlothian," each in two 
volumes; and "The Black Dwarf," in one volume. It 
would certainly be difficult to say wherein this dainty 
little edition could be improved.

having been finally shut off from dominion on the Continent of Europe, 

began gradually, and at first with indifferent success, to grasp empire 

beyond the wider seas, impelled mainly by the simple instinct to be 

doing, by the indomitable energy of its people, who could not be satisfied 

with merely maintaining a national existence.

Bird Studies 

An Account of the Land Birds of Eastern North America. 
By WILLIAM E. D. SCOTT. With over 170 Illustrations from 
Original Photographs. Quarto, leather back, gilt top. 
This work, while strictly accurate in every particular, avoids the use 
of all technical terms. The illustrations are from original photographs, 
many of them being taken directly from live birds. A distinctive fea- 
ture of the book is the views of nests, these having been photographed, 
often with no little difficulty, without being removed from their original 
positions.

SPRING ANNOUNCEMENTS. 



Victor Serenus. 

A Story of the Pauline Era. By HENRY WOODS. 12mo, 

cloth, pp. 510, $1.50. 

The scene is located in that very dramatic period of the 
world's history, the Pauline era, and through graphic charac- 
ter delineation deals with the thought, customs, and religious 
systems of that time. 

While the historic framework is carefully preserved, there 
is a wide range of the fancy and imagination in the movement. 
Love, adventure, romance, idealism, and magic are handled 
in action to combine entertainment, instruction, and profit. 

Hawaii's Story. 

By Hawaii's Queen, LILIUOKALANI. 8vo, cloth, full gilt and 

gilt top, pp. 8+409, illustrated, $2.00. 

The work is undoubtedly the most important contribution 
to the history of the Hawaiian Revolution, and the causes 
leading up to it, which has been presented to the American 
people, and with the treaty of annexation now pending before 
the U. S. Senate, should command the attention of the read- 
ing and thinking public.

trated, $1.00 net.

incident, up to date, and with the only kind of ending proper 
to such a novel, happy and successful." 



The Painter in Oil. 

A Complete Treatise on the Principles and Technique Neces-

BURLEIGH PARKHURST. 12mo, cloth, pp. 14+405, illus- 
trated, and containing colored plates, $1.25. 
He who would paint a picture and he who would judge of 
one must know the same things the one practically and the 
other theoretically and both will find what they need in this

Water- Color Painting. 

A Book of Elementary Instruction for Beginners and Ama- 
teurs. By GRACE BARTON ALLEN. 12mo, cloth, pp. 250, 
illustrated, and containing colored plates, $1.25. 
This volume, which is a practical text-book on the art of 
painting in water-colors, is intended for the use of amateurs, 
and of those water-color teachers who are not yet sufficiently 
accustomed as instructors to realize how much the average 
pupil does not know. Taking for granted absolute ignorance 
on the part of the reader, it explains, as far as may be done in 
print, the technicalities of this branch of art in simple and 
intelligible language, treating of colors and materials, as well 
as of flower, landscape, and figure painting in polychrome and 
monochrome.

SCRIBNER'S NEWEST BOOKS 



First Edition of 10,000 copies ready Saturday, 
THE GIRL AT COBHURST. By Frank R. Stockton. 

I2mo, $1.50. 

A N entirely new love-story which contains some of Mr. Stockton's best humorous work. The scene is laid 
'* in one of the little country villages he knows so intimately, and the characters all bear the stamp of his 
inimitable genius. The development of the plot is strikingly ingenious, even for such a past-master in these 
intricacies as the author has for years shown himself to be. 



" His unique stories always hit 
the mark." Century. 

" Mr. Stockton has touched the 
high-water mark of romantic fic- 
tion and has shown his power to 
grasp the magic of Defoe and Stev- 
enson." The Speaker. 



" Mr. Frank R. Stockton's gift 
is one of the most characteristic 
which has yet appeared in our lit- 
erature. The fact that it is hu- 
morous and light must not make 
us oblivions of its original qual- 
ity." The Outlook. 



" I have been reading him now 
a good many yean with an increas- 
ing pleasure which his constant 
public seems to share, and I am 
certain that our literature does not 
know a more original or origina- 
tive spirit." W. D. Hawells. 



" His name alone carries a laugh 
with it." The Dial. 

' There is no more thoroughly 
entertaining writer before the 
public to-day than Mr. Stockton. 
He write* to amuse, and he suc- 
ceeds admirably. " Bottom Globe. 



Ready To-day : Field Reminiscences by a Famous Comedian. 
THE EUGENE FIELD I KNEW. By Francis Wilson.

Also a limited edition of SO 4 copies on hand-made paper, the illustrations being printed 

on Japan paper, and with a four-page facsimile manuscript in colors ; each, $400 net. 

T"HE well-known actor has here given an entertaining and valuable account of Eugene Field, whose intimate 

* friend he was for many years. His picture of the humorous side of Mr. Field's nature is reinforced by 
anecdotes which display the love of fun that was so characteristic of the man; and Mr. Wilson pays much 
attention also to the deep and enduring love of books, an affection both literary and bibliographical, which 
is a prominent feature in most of the poet's work. His many admirers will surely welcome this attractive 
portrayal of the real Eugene Field.

This work relates to the movement for colonizing 
America by the English during 1605-1627, with especial 
reference to the period of " The Treasurer and Com- 
pany of Adventurers and Planters of the City of London 
for the first Colony in Virginia" (sometimes called " The 
Virginia Company of London "), 1609-1624. It is a 
work of great importance, based on original documents, 
and never so fully or fairly presented before. 

Washington versus Jefferson. 

By MOSES M. GRANGER. 12mo, $1.25. 
Mr. Granger's object is to set forth clearly the two 
opposing views, dating from Washington and Jefferson, 
concerning the relation between the States and the 
National Government, the theory of State rights and 
the theory of National supremacy. He aims to show that 
the National point of view is the only sound view, and 
fortifies his argument by citations from the framers of 
the Constitution, from Washington and Marshall, from 
many court decisions, and lastly from the decision of 
the " Court of War." His work is clear, sound, and 
puts in compact form strong facts and arguments which 
make his book very conclusive and worthy of reading by 
all thoughtful citizens.

By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER. With many

" The author of the ' Nineteenth Century ' series of historical narra 
ti ves, has, perhaps, too modestly disclaimed any right to be classed a 
an historian. Her last volume has more merit than the one she claims 
when she says, ' There is no other [book] which supplies a general 
view of what has happened in Spain during the present century.' " 
Literature (New York). 

" The interest which attaches itself in this country just now to Spain 
and Spanish politics makes the publication of ' Spain in the 19th Cen- 
tury ' timely and valuable. . . . Like the previous volumes on France, 
Russia and Turkey, England, Africa, and Italy, it gives the busy reader 
in a compact and interesting narrative a survey of the recent political 
history of the country of which it treats. The entire series is well 
planned and commendably executed." The Outlook (New York).

ZA CHRIS TOPELIUS. 

The death of Zachris Topelius, on the thir- 
teenth of last month, having been passed over 
in comparative silence by the American press, 
it appears fitting that we should make some 
statement, although a little belated, of the sig- 
nificance of his work, and attempt some sort 
of summary of his great literary activities. The 
impression seems to be current that, because 
Topelius was a Finn, he must have been a light 
of Finnish literature, and that his work was 
done in the dialect of the " Kalevala." This, 
of course, is not the case, for, although a mas- 
ter of his native tongue, and an authority upon 
the history of Finland, he had the wisdom to 
realize, no less than his great contemporary 
Rnneberg, that as the political fortunes of his 
country had for so long been merged with those 
of Sweden, so the best service he could give to 
his race would be to cement still closer its spir- 
itual bond with Sweden, the greatest honor he 
could do his country would be to increase the 
share of its contribution to the only literature 
through which Finnish ideals and aspirations 
might hope to flow into the current of European 
culture. Hence, although " torn like a bloody 
shield from the heart of Sweden," Finland has 
been brought, since the Russian domination, 
closer in spirit to its old time suzerain than 
ever before, and it thus comes about that the 
names of two nineteenth-century Finns are to 
be reckoned among the greatest in Swedish 
letters. 

Topelius was born January 14, 1818, and 
was educated at the University of Helsingfors. 
In 1842 he became editor of the Helsingfors 
" Tidningar," retaining the connection until 
1860, and giving to the public through the 
medium of this newspaper his earlier poems 
and novels. Meanwhile (1854), he was called 
to a chair in his alma mater, where he per- 
formed the function of a professor of history 
for nearly a quarter of a century. In 1878, at 
the age of sixty, he resigned from the Univer- 
sity, that he might devote himself exclusively 
to literary composition, and now, at the ripe 
age of eighty, he has passed away, after having 
enriched Swedish literature with a memorable 
series of works in prose and verse. 

These works are so numerous that we may 



248 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



no more than mention the greater number of 
them, and that chiefly for the purpose of indi- 
cating the wide range of the author's interests 
and attainments. There are the three volumes 
of poems called " Ljungblommor " (Heather 
Blossoms), besides two later collections of verse. 
He wrote profusely for the stage, his chief plays 
being " Titian's Forsta Karlek " (Titian's First 
Love), " Ett Skargaardsafventyr " (A Tale of 
the Islands), "Efter Femtio Aar" (Fifty 
Years After), "Regina af Emmerits," and 
" Princessan af Cypern " (The Princess of Cy- 
prus), the last-named work being a fairy-drama, 
borrowed from the "Kalevala," and written 
for the inauguration of the national theatre at 
Helsingfors. As a writer for children he pro- 
duced many volumes of " Sagor " (Legendary 
Tales) and u Lasning for Barn " (Reading for 
the Young). His " Naturens Bok " (The Book 
of Nature) has been widely useful in the Swed- 
ish and Finnish schools. His works of serious 
scholarship include a history of the war in Fin- 
land, and several books devoted to the descrip- 
tion of his native country. 

Such a series of books as has above been 
catalogued would secure a commanding posi- 
tion for any worker in the field of letters. But 
the most important work of Topelius remains 
to be mentioned. It is the cycle of historical 
romances entitled " Faltskarns Berattelser " 
(The Surgeon's Stories) that has extended the 
fame of their author far beyond the bounds of 
Finland and the Scandinavian peninsula, that 
has, in short, won for him his place in the noble 
company of great historical novelists that be- 
gins with Scott, and ends (for the present) with 
Mr. Sienkiewicz. In addition to this great 
series of tales, Topelius produced a second 
series, entitled "Vinterqvaller " (Winter Even- 
ings), somewhat less coherent than the former, 
but having to a considerable extent the same 
general characteristics. 

" The Surgeon's Stories " form a cycle of bril- 
liant and vivid episodes from the great period 
of Sweden's history the period of Grustaf 
Adolf and Charles XII. and from the period 
of her decline during the eighteenth century. 
There are fifteen of them altogether, linked 
together externally by the personality of the 
surgeon who narrates them to a group of friends, 
and internally, not only by the historical se- 
quence of events, but also by a device which is 
the invention of the author. Alongside with 
the history of the kings who figure conspicu- 
ously in the narrative, there is traced for us 
the history of two families, one of the people 



and one of the nobility, and of these families 
some members figure prominently in each tale. 
As the descent of the royal line is traced from 
one generation to another, the descent of these 
families is in like manner traced from father to 
son through the entire series. Thus we have 
all three elements of Swedish society, the king, 
the nobility, and the people, represented in 
members of these families throughout the nar- 
rative. And there is still another bond of union 
in the shape of a ring which is closely connected 
with the fortunes of the principal characters in 
these romances. So ingeniously is this made 
to figure in the narrative, that the somewhat 
questionable device of introducing such an ele- 
ment of enchantment or superstition may be 
pardoned, especially as such a device finds hon- 
orable precedents in romantic literature. For 
this ring has the power of bringing to its owner 
good-fortune as long as it shall remain in his 
possession, and he shall not forfeit claim to its 
protection by perjuring himself. And this ring, 
unlike that famous ring of the Niblungs which 
brought only a curse to its possessor, is also un- 
like it in being a thing of no value in itself, a 
mere bit of copper with a symbolical inscription. 

The standard English translation of this 
romantic cycle occupies six volumes, of which 
the first three bring us down to the death of 
Charles XII., that turning-point in Swedish 
history, while the three remaining volumes 
carry the narrative on to the closing years of 
the eighteenth century. In the first half of the 
work we have, then, such episodes as the Battle 
of Liitzen, the wars with Poland, Denmark, 
and Russia, a remarkable study of the witch- 
craft superstition in Finland, the Finnish fam- 
ine of 1697, the revolution in land tenure known 
as the Great Reduction, the plague of 1710, 
the Battle of Pultova, and the Norwegian expe- 
dition of Charles XII. with its fatal outcome. 
In the second and less stirring half of the work 
we have depicted for us the gradual recupera- 
tion of Sweden after the Peace of Nystad, the 
political intrigues of the Hat and Cap parties, 
the injurious commercial policy of the King- 
dom, the academic life of the period, the char- 
acter and work of the great Linnaeus, and the 
vagaries of the Swedish alchemists. 

Topelius does not belong to the archasolog- 
ical school of historical novelists, and there is 
no trace of pedantry in his work. We do not 
mean by this that he is open to the charge of 
perverting historical material or even to that 
of any very considerable inaccuracy, but merely 
that he does not allow his imagination to be

THE DIAL

fettered by a too close adherence to historical 
details, that he claims for invention the right 
of full sway in matters which do not concern 
the essential features of the epoch or the situa- 
tion to be portrayed. In one of the interludes 
which occur between the tales, the author, speak- 
ing in the person of the Surgeon, but evidently 
for himself, thus defends his method : 

" I will not dictate anyone's belief, nor do I deny that 
all the names and details which I mention will be looked 
for in vain in the chronicles. For my idea about story- 
telling is that its truth consists in its possibility of being 
true; by its agreeing with the essential characteristics 
of what is to be described. I will even go so far as to 
say, that in this way the reality may sometimes be more 
clearly shown than by a mere record of events. I can, 
for instance, picture Napoleon eating a sandwich 
posito, that I have really seen him eating a sandwich; 
can I, therefore, say that I have given a good picture 
of Napoleon? But suppose I invent about him some 
great exploit which never really happened, but which is 
entirely like him ; or that I put in bis mouth some strong 
word which he never uttered, but which corresponds to 
a hair with his actual temperament is not that which 
I have imagined more essentially real than the small 
sandwich which is real only by chance? " 

Topelius has been for many years a teacher of 
history, and every teacher of history whom ped- 
antry has not entirely dessicated knows how 
supremely important to the student is the ac- 
quisition of those broad general views of past 
times and events which alone can give meaning 
to the details, and how valuable an auxiliary 
he may find in those romances wherein writers 
of genius have been pleased to interpret and 
inform with a new vitality scenes and charac- 
ters typical of past momentous epochs in the 
history of mankind. 

The beauty of style in these books is at times 
very marked, and does not always disappear in 
the translation. The following passage, de- 
scriptive of the last moments of one of the nob- 
lest among the noble race of the Bertelskjolds, 
may be quoted by way of illustration. 

" His beautiful head, surrounded by its once black 
locks now silvered by time, was still the slumbering wit- 
ness of a soul noble and sensitive, proud, brave, and 
heroic. He slept, as a past time slumbers in the sunshine 
of the new. 

" The sun which now shown into Abo Castle was the 
evening sun of the grand and eventful seventeenth cen- 
tury, alike gigantic in the spiritual and material world. 
Its night was felt to be near, when, after the setting of 
the star of Charles XL, two new and far more powerful 
and brilliant stars, one in the west, the other in the east, 
appeared above the horizon. The blue rim which Ber- 
telskjold in vain sought in the icy sea, had now widened 
into a glittering fjord, where the waves played free; 
and now it was spring everywhere in the spiritual realms, 
and the ice of superstition commenced to melt, and the 
eternally swelling billows of human thought freely began 
to seek the infinite beyond the shores of time. 



" Let us pause here, at the first view of spring. The 
disappearing snow must always remember that it melts 
before the sun of heaven; the springing verdure must 
never forget that the snow-drifts protected its roots from 
the wintry frosts. May the old go out, may the new 
come in, with love ! 

" And so ends our story, one evening in spring. And 
God knows when the berries will ripen in the woods." 

With these solemn and pathetic words we leave 
the old century for the new, and are prepared 
for the brief but brilliant career of Charles XII. 
Here we undoubtedly have the climax of the 
entire work ; but it is the fault of history rather 
than of Topelius that the interest of his story 
must decline with the death of that great sol- 
dier. Yet the chronicle goes on to the time of 
the Napoleonic wars, and we would not willingly 
miss the volumes that cover the eighteenth cen- 
tury. We might indeed wish that the narrative 
had not ended here, but Topelius did not have 
the heart to write of the transformation of his 
own country into a part of the Russian Empire. 
For he always wrote, although in the Swedish 
language, as a Finn, and it is as such that he 
penned these proud and loving words : 

" And the Baltic stretches its mighty blue arms east 
and north, and folds in its tumultuous embrace a daugh- 
ter of the sea, a land of the waves which had sprung up 
from its bosom, and, still increasing, lifts her solid rocks 
high above her mother's heart. Finland is the best be- 
loved child of the Baltic. To this day she empties her 
treasures into her mother's lap; and the mighty sea la 
not uplifted by the offering, but draws lovingly and ten- 
derly back, like an indulgent mother, that the daughter 
may grow, and every summer clothe with grass and flow- 
ers new shores laid open to the day. Happy the land 
which lulls in its bosom the waves of a thousand lakes, 
and stretches a shore of nine hundred miles toward the 
sea!" 



TOLSTOI ON ART AND BEAUTY. 

Will Count Tolstoi, the great Russian novelist 
and moralist, revolutionize current conceptions of 
art? He firmly believes that he is bound and able 
to effect such a revolution, and he is engaged on a 
philosophical work dealing with the origin, function, 
and social mission of art. One chapter of this work 
has been published in a Russian magazine called 
" Questions of Psychology and Philosophy," and the 
ideas there expressed have attracted considerable 
attention in the Russian and French press. It ap- 
pears to me that Tolstoi has really advanced an 
important, if not original, suggestion, though bis 
sweeping generalizations cannot be accepted without 
material qualifications. 

What Tolstoi objects to most strenuously is the 
assumption of writers on art that there is a close and 
vital connection between art and beauty, and that the 
object of art is to gratify the aesthetic needs. Is there,

he asks, an objective definition of beauty ? Has ever 
a test been formulated which would enable us to 
draw a distinct line between subjects properly com- 
ing within the scope and jurisdiction of art, and sub- 
jects unfit for artistic treatment ? Answering these 
questions in the negative, Tolstoi imagines that he 
has proved the necessity of rejecting absolutely the 
notion that art ministers to pleasure. He denounces 
this notion as vicious and injurious, and he holds it 
directly responsible for the decadent tendencies in 
the various branches of art. Indeed, so convinced 
is he of the soundness and value of his own new 
theory that he regrets that his great novels were 
written under the tacit acceptance of the prevailing 
view. " I should have produced very different 
works," he virtually says, " had I made my discov- 
ery at the opening of my career as an imaginative 
writer." 

And what, in brief, is his revolutionary theory ? 
This : That art is one of the necessary conditions of 
social existence, an essential means of intercourse 
between man and man; that all art activity is 
founded on the psychological fact that a man who 
assimilates an expression of emotion by a fellow- 
man is made to undergo the same psychological ex- 
perience as that of the other man. The origin and 
beginning of art, Tolstoi proceeds, may be referred 
to the moment when man, conceiving the purpose of 
imparting to others feelings experienced by himself, 
first reproduces these feelings in himself, and then, 
by means of signs and symbols, manifests them so 
as to affect others. Where feeling is imparted, and 
the object is this conveyance, we have art. The 
means are found in movements, lines, colors, sounds, 
images, and words ; but in every case the purpose 
is to excite before-experienced feelings and emotions. 

All emotions, the strong as well as the faint, 
the noble as well as the mean, the significant as 
well as the trivial, constitute the subject matter 
of art. Take the feeling of self-abnegation and 
resignation to the decree of fate produced by 
the drama ; or take the ardent joy and ecstasy of 
love depicted in romance ; or the enjoyment of 
nature excited by a painting ; or the inspiration and 
courage conveyed by martial and triumphal music ; 
or the infectious gayety of the dance ; or the grati- 
fication of the sense of humor by an anecdote ; or, 
finally, the sense of peace and serenity excited by a 
quiet evening scene what is there essentially in 
common in these various manifestations of art ? The 
answer is, the reproduction and conveyance of feel- 
ing. And what is the object of such reproduction 
and conveyance? The promotion of mutual under- 
standing and sympathy by means of artistic forms 
of expression. Human intercourse would be crude 
and inadequate if we were confined to the ordinary 
means ; to convey the more intimate and delicate 
emotions art is needed music, poetry, painting, 
sculpture, movement, the drama. Instead of orig- 
inating in the " play impulse," as some scientists 
teach, instead of affording a channel for the expend- 
iture of excessive vitality, art originates in the need 



of perfect intercourse ; hence its transcendent im- 
portance in man's intellectual and moral life. 

Since Tolstoi claims absolute precision for his 
formula, it may be pointed out that what we know 
of the methods and ways of artists does not tend to 
support the reiterated assertion that in every case 
the purpose of the artist is to reproduce in himself 
and convey "before -experienced" emotions. It 
may be admitted, in a general sense, that when Beet- 
hoven composed his Pastoral symphony he repro- 
duced emotions he had actually experienced in the 
country. But take such a work as Richard Straus's 
" Thus Spake Zarathustra." Can it be maintained 
that while reading Nietzsche's strange masterpiece 
he felt the musical forms in which he embodied, 
subsequently, the abstract ideas of man's struggles, 
changes, and search for the meaning of life? The 
truth is that Strauss tried very hard to find musical 
equivalents to those abstract ideas. Whether he was 
entirely successful or not, his symphonic poem can- 
not be excluded from any proper definition of art. 
If we refuse to exclude it, we must qualify the Tol- 
stoi definition. This, however, is only in passing. 

The real question arising in one's mind is what 
reason Tolstoi has given for banishing the ideas of 
beauty and pleasure from his philosophy of art? 
Granting that he has laid stress on a point of cardi- 
nal importance, not perhaps sufficiently considered 
before, though dimly perceived by all thinkers, 
what necessary antagonism is there between the con- 
ception that art is a " condition of social existence " 
and an " important means of intercourse," and the 
conception that art aims to reproduce or represent 
beauty ? That art yields pleasure, Tolstoi does not 
deny; he merely insists that the pleasure is inci- 
dental, just as the pleasure from the absorption of 
food is incidental to the deeper object of sustaining 
life. But Tolstoi's principle leaves us without a 
guide so far as the choice of subjects for artistic 
treatment is concerned. Art, as he says, may con- 
vey low and ignoble emotions as well as noble and 
high ones ; but what emotions ought the artist to 
convey ? Here, clearly, the old quarrel between the 
literary realists and romanticists presents itself in a 
wider aspect. The artist has many experiences ; 
which among them shall he select for reproduction 
and conveyance? Is not the real answer, which 
Tolstoi could not escape if pressed, that he is bound 
to select the finest and most exalted? In other 
words, is he not to select that which embodies phy- 
sical, intellectual, or moral beauty? 

Such an answer would reconcile the Tolstoi view 
with that he vehemently combats. Indeed, in rightly 
saying that without art the most intimate and deli- 
cate emotions could not be expressed at all, does 
he not imply that the object and value of art lie 
in refining and elevating human nature by convey- 
ing the most exalted feelings of which the most 
sensitive and receptive of us, the artists, are capa- 
ble? On Tolstoi's own definition the highest art is 
necessarily the most beautiful, the truest, the pro- 
foundest. Why, then, is it false and degrading to

say that the object of art is to promote the appre- 
ciation of beauty as a means of spiritual culture and 
social improvement? 

Tolstoi abhors the principle of art for art's sake, 
but he is wrong in thinking that this principle owes 
its recognition to the identification of art with 
beauty. It is natural for Tolstoi to contend for the 
social mission of art, but the utter repudiation of 
beauty is neither demanded by his own theory of 
the origin of art nor calculated to strengthen the 
tendency toward constituting art a handmaid of 
moral progress, the tendency which Tolstoi would 
encourage. It is interesting to find that even in the 
Russian press Tolstoi's philosophy of art has not 
been sympathetically received. It is doubtful 
whether his complete work will have the effect he 
hopes for and intends. VICTOB 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 



London, April 4, 1898. 

I am afraid the season has proved not a very profitable 
one for publishers. It is, of course, too early to make 
any final statement; bat all signs, so far, point to an 
extremely dull time, and complaints are being murmured 
of the bad trade. As a matter of fact, with the excep- 
tions of a few novels and Bodley's " History of France," 
hardly any book has made the slightest stir. Of the 
novels, the most marked attention has been paid to Mr. 
Israel Zangwill, for his " Dreamers of the Ghetto." 

The impress of the sixpenny illustrated magazine is 
on everything. Whatever falling off there is in the 
business of the publishing world may be safely put down 
to that counter-influence. Nowadays, people get in the 
illustrated magazine all they apparently want in the 
way of reading; and they get it tastefully served, and 
in piquant, small courses; so that, in addition to the 
excellent material, there is the charm of variety, and 
also the advantage of cheapness. Messrs. Newnes and 
Messrs. Pearson, and particularly the former, are reap- 
ing a great harvest of profit. Messrs. Newnes have just 
brought out another " monthly " The Wide World 
Magazine" and this again promises to "catch on"; 
and now we hear brave rumors of another illustrated 
magazine, this time at threepence. The Harmsworth Co. 
intend to make this threepenny venture a " perfect mar- 
vel" for the money; at any rate, that is what we hear. 
Certainly, if anybody can do it, this house can. Maga- 
zines are on everybody's lips, and another again is on 
the stocks, in the shape of a great illustrated literary 
monthly, at one shilling. Whether or no anything will 
come of it remains to be seen. Literary magazines, in 
this country, seem fated for failure. 

Among the really fine books that we are to have will 
be a glorious edition of the works of Shakespeare ; I do 
not mean a great, cumbersome, annotated one, filled with 
antiquarian lore and the grubbings of British Museum 
work, I mean an edition which, for type and " get-up," 
from the point of view of the art of the printer, will, 
without doubt, prove to be the most beautifully printed 
book of the century. It is intended to issue it in fifty 
parts. At present, I can only tell you that the famous 
Constable firm of printers will be responsible for its 



appearance, and Mr. Grant Richards, who promises to 
become a rather important influence in the publishing 
world, is to introduce it to all who love Shakespeare and 
to all who love beautiful books. The same printing 
press is busy with an edition of Butler's " Lives of the 
Saints," which is announced by Messrs. Gerald Duck- 
worth & Co. 

Messrs. George Bell & Sons are getting ready a large 
and fully illustrated work on Westminster Abbey; but 
the edition is to be limited to three hundred and fifty 
copies, of which Messrs. Macmillan of New York will 
have one hundred for America. They have also another 
volume by Mr. Walter Crane " in preparation." This 
is to be a series of lectures on the subject of " Form and 
Line in Art." Charmingly printed editions, by the 
Chis wick Press, of Mrs. Browning's " Sonnets from the 
Portuguese," and Long's translation of the "Medita- 
tions " of Marcus Antoninus, will also be issued; but of 
these works you will have opportunity to judge in 
America, since you are to have editions. 

Talking of editions of Shakespeare, I hear that Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co. have commissioned one of our younger 
Professors of Literature Dr. Herf ord to undertake 
a new annotated edition, one which shall take the place 
of the well-known " Cambridge Edition," of which they 
hold the publishing rights. Not that this venture is 
likely soon to be completed. At any rate, the volumes 
will doubtless form, from time to time, a distinguishing 
feature in Messrs. Macmillan's announcements. 

Towards the autumn, Messrs. C. A. Pearson will 
issue the following novels, which have not as yet been 
announced here : " The Adventures of Captain Kettle," 
by Mr. C. J. Cntcliffe Hyne; "The Phantom Army," 
by Mr. Max Pemberton; "Under the Black Flag," by 
Mr. William Coestall; "Despair's Last Journey," by 
Mr. David Christie Murray; "Settled Out of Court," 
by Mr. G. B. Burgin; "Brothers of the People," by 
Mr. Fred Whishaw; "The Seed of the Poppy," by Mr. 
Clive Holland; and a new novel, the title of which has 
not yet been fixed, by Mrs. L. B. Walford. Mr. Bret 
Harte will also issue his new volume of stories through 
the same firm. 

An important series of illustrated histories and guides 
to our public schools is being prepared, and will be issued 
by Messrs. George Bell & Sons. The series is to begin 
with volumes on Eton, Harrow, Shrewsbury, and, I be- 
lieve, Rugby and Winchester. The scheme is an excel- 
lent one, if only for the reason that no such short and 
handy works are to be had.

THE VOTE BY STATES ON THE FEDERAL 

CONSTITUTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, in the very 
first of those merry caprices with which he adorned the 
first volumes of "The Atlantic Monthly," says: "All 
generous minds have a horror of what are called facts. 
They are the brute beasts of the intellectual domain." 
To be sure, a little later he warns the reader to " con- 
dition " and " qualify " this remark with a certain amount 
of " seasoning " before making it one of the axioms of 
practical life. We are all of us aware of some minds 
so " generous " (we use the Autocrat's euphemism) that 
they use none of the suggested seasoning: at least they 
keep a respectful distance from fact, with due horror of 
too close an approach. But, as he said, " Logic is logic: 
that's all I say," so we may urge History is history: 
when it gets away from fact it is not history. It may 
be well to correct small errors. 

Reviewing lately the ever-interesting story of the 
adoption of the Constitution of the United States, I was 
led, by discrepancies between some of the ordinary books 
that relate the actions of the several state conventions, 
to look into " Elliott's Debates," constantly cited as our 
chief authority. Turning to the vote in Massachusetts, 
I find recorded the entire list of voters, man by man, 
the names of the towns which they represented being 
given, all arranged by counties, with the footing of each 
county by itself, and the final footing Yeas 187, Nays 
168. This is the footing given in most historical works; 
it is so given as the result in Fiske's " Critical Period," 
Larned's "History for Ready Reference," Harpers' 
" Book of Facts," Schouler's " History of the United 
States," and other books of like excellence. Hart's 
" Formation of the Union " says 187 to 167." Mr. 
George T. Curtis, in Winsor's " Narrative and Critical 
History," says the majority was nineteen. 

Now, if one will add the footings for the several 
counties as given in Elliott, he will be surprised to find 
Yeas 202, Nays 155; a majority of forty-seven. But 
testing the county footings, he finds Essex put down as 
38 yeas, 6 nays; yet a careful count shows it should 
have been 37 yeas, 7 nays. The next county, Middlesex, 
is footed 17 yeas, 25 nays: it should have been 18 yeas, 
24 nays. These two errors balance each other. The 
next, Hampshire, is put down as 33 yeas, 19 nays: it 
should have been 19 yeas, 32 nays, a double error. 
The rest of the counties are footed correctly. The final 
result when these errors are corrected is Yeas 186, 
Nays 168: a majority of eighteen; not of nineteen, as 
most have it, nor of twenty, as Professor Hart has it. 



He has the total vote correct, 354, which I verified by 
repeated countings of the names. [Elliott, Vol. II., 
pp. 178-181.] 

Some writers give the vote of New York as 30 yeas, 

28 nays. A test vote before the final one gave 31 yeas, 

29 nays, sixty members voting ; but on the final vote of 
fifty-seven members the yeas were 30, nays 27. If the 
president had voted as he did on the previous day there 
wouhi have been 28 nays; but one of each side was ab- 
sent, and the president did not vote. 

The vote of Virginia is also generally misstated, as 
Yeas 89, Nays 79. Elliott gives this vote by a list of 
the voters in the affirmative first, wherein we find James 
Madison and John Marshall, the two who really carried 
the convention with them by fact and argument. Then 
is given the list of negative voters, where we find noted 
names, as James Monroe, Patrick Henry, George Mason, 
John Tyler, and Edmund Ruffin the latter name made 
notorious by the man who bore it in 1861, and obtained 
the favor of firing the first secessionist gun at Fort 
Sumter. The clerk gave no numbers at the foot of the 
lists; but in the table of contents the vote is stated as 
usually given, 89 to 79. A glance at the list of noes lets 
the reader see that these columns are of equal length, 
which cannot make 79; each column has twenty-six 
names, making 78. Eleven majority, not ten, was given 
in the Virginia convention for the formation of the Union. 

While hunting in " Niles's Register " I came upon a 
singular fact : there was no official declaration as to 
what states voted for the several candidates for the 
presidency when John Quincy Adams was elected presi- 
dent by the House of Representatives in 1821. The 
reason was that the vote was by ballot, and the ballots 
did not show who cast them. Webster, and Randolph 
of Roanoke, were of the committee of tellers; Webster 
announced to the speaker that thirteen votes had been 
cast for Adams, seven for Jackson, and four for Craw- 
ford; Randolph instantly rose and said that thirteen 
states had voted for Adams, seven for Jackson, and f our 
for Crawford. But how the several representatives 
voted may be found in " Niles's Register," Vol. 27, in 
the issue following that which told the congressional 
proceedings. SAMUEL WILLARD.

A DEFECT IN AN EXCELLENT TEXT -BOOK. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Shall I seem invidious if I ask for space to call atten- 
tion to a defect in a very excellent text-book which I 
have had the pleasure of examining lately: Dr. Mead's 
edition of Malory's " Morte Darthur "? 

In the Introduction, the fifteenth century literature 
of Scotland is too slightly mentioned to give a correct 
idea of Malory's position among writers nearly of his 
time. The literary efflorescence at the court of James 
the Fourth may have had little, if any, effect on other 
places, but is of real interest in itself; and a suitable 
edition of the earlier "King's Quair" would find for 
that delicious poem the audience of all men who pre- 
tend to be well-read in English literature. A scholar 
of to-day might like to accost the ghost of Dr. Johnson 
with the remark : " Sir, in the fifteenth century the lit- 
erary centre of Great Britain was not in England but 
in Scotland." No doubt the retort would be prompt and 
vigorous, after the manner of one who tossed and gored. 
But the statement is worthy of recognition.

A GREAT ROMAS- PRELATE.* 

Mr. Wilfrid Ward, when he writes a biog- 
raphy, is sure of readers. His life of his father 
is a masterpiece. It is given to few sons so to 
paint a father's portrait that it shall be at once 
attractive and convincing. To be sure, William 
George Ward was a rare personality, suggest- 
ive of vigorous handling. 

Cardinal Wiseman was hardly a less remark- 
able subject for Mr. Wilfrid Ward's treatment. 
The biographer's knowledge of him is naturally 
less direct and immediate, such as a boy could 
have of a frequent visitor at his father's house, 
who was fond of talking with children. The 
first English cardinal since the days of Pole 
was likely to make a mark on a boy's lively 
imagination. The traditional memories would 
long remain of one who looked and lived the 
part of a great churchman, and was " abund- 
antly endowed with those specially human qual- 
ities " which give life-blood to character. 

The grandfather of Nicholas Wiseman mi- 
grated from Ireland to Spain late in the eigh- 
teenth century. His son, a Spanish merchant, 
married, as his second wife, an Irish lady. On 
August 2, 1802, the day before Napoleon's con- 
sulate for life began, her child was born at 
Seville. She laid the infant upon the Cathedral 
altar, and devoted him to the service of the 
Church. " The first stratum of his mind was 
deeply tinged by the soil on which he was born." 
There was a hidalgo reserve and grandiosity 
about him always, in spite of his genial temper. 

The sight of the prize crews ashore at Cadiz 
after Trafalgar may have stirred the young 
Spaniard's modicum of British blood, and pre- 
pared him for his return, at three years old, to 
Ireland. He was presently put to school, to 
acquire, with or without a local brogue, the 
English tongue. Five years later he was trans- 
ferred to a Roman Catholic college near Dur- 
ham. It had been an offshoot of Douay. As 
the school of a proscribed class it developed 
vigor and intensity in its pupils. It checked 
speculation. It curbed the restive genius of the 
young Southerner, half Iberian and half Celt, 
and cooled without chilling his fervid blood. 

He describes himself at this time as " a lone, 
unmurmuring boy, who could find no pastime 
so sweet as a book." An absorbed and self-

reliant student, on the way to become "the 
solid manly Englishman of whom Englishmen 
were proud," he passed for a somewhat dull lad 
among his gayer contemporaries. He was a 
gawky, ill-knit figure, as he sauntered about, 
deep in his books, with no interest in athletic 
games. His religion helped to isolate him. A 
papist was under the ban in those days in Prot- 
estant England. The boy of ten or twelve was 
hooted for his creed, as he stood in Durham at 
his mother's window. This early experience of 
intolerance probably stiffened his fibre and 
made him instinctively more a papist than be- 
fore. It doubtless had its part in reconciling 
him to an early exile, as a candidate for the 
priesthood, at the English College just then 
revived at Rome. The journey from England 
to Italy was an adventure, with perils asea and 
ashore. The boy of sixteen landed at Leghorn 
after a voyage of almost three months. Thence 
to Rome, now a few hours' transit, was a jour- 
ney of anxious days and nights. There were 
alarming tales of brigands, illustrated by recent 
captures hanged in terrorem by the way. The 
cry of " Ecco Roma " rejoiced the weary trav- 
eller's ears ; and at the door of the re-opened 
college the figure of the ancient porter, who 
stood " all salutation, mumbling toothless wel- 
comes in as yet an almost unknown tongue," 
was a joyous vision. 

It was a season of awakening hope, after long 
years of disaster, for the adherents of the papacy. 
Pius the Seventh had returned from his exile. 
Napoleon was entombed alive at St. Helena. 
The storm had blown itself out, and kings, and 
pontiffs also, " crept out to feel the sun." Let- 
ters and art began to revive, the art still some- 
what academic under Canova and Oberbeck 
and Cornelius, but in the realm of the blind the 
one-eyed are kings. Hand in hand throughout 
Europe went the Romantic Movement in liter- 
ature and the Catholic Reaction in religion. It 
was a stimulating period. The young student 
at the English College was not wholly engaged 
with theology and philosophy, but found his 
recreation in music and Italian art and Roman 
antiquities and Oriental languages. His very 
walks about Rome were fruitful of inspiration 
and suggestion. Nor were they lacking in a 
spice of adventure, for banditti close to the great 
capital were not quite unheard of. 

To one familiar with the chill and severity 
of the Anglican service or the Roman service 
in England at that period, the splendor of Ro- 
man ceremonial was an impressive contrast. It 
affected the imagination of as stout Protestants

as Bunsen and Stanley and Macaulay. The 
time had not come when a Roman Catholic 
lady, on attending a certain ritualistic church 
in New York, could tell her protestant friend 
that the service was beautiful, but she preferred 
the simplicity of her own, Roman, worship. 
The tropical nature of Wiseman was profoundly 
moved by such splendors. With scrupulous 
minuteness of detail and loving tenderness of 
phrase he described the appearance of the aged 
Pope at the festival of Corpus Christi. The 
page is ablaze with color and ornament. It is 
the sketch of an artist and poet rather than 
of a priest or student. It is excessive in its 
enumeration of all that met the eye or struck 
the mind. " A gift for particularization is as 
precious as a gift for generalization," said an 
able thinker ; and Wiseman possessed the for- 
mer gift, even superabundantly. When the 
day came that he must leave these alluring 
ceremonials and all the kindred fascinations of 
Rome, when duty called him to take up his 
abode in a less exuberant climate and a paler 
civilization, Wiseman found the change a sac- 
rifice. He yearned toward the scenes of his 
youth ever after. 

Receiving his doctorate in divinity at the age 
of twenty-one, he was at twenty-five made Vice- 
Rector of his college. His life was now the 
life of the brilliant scholar, the student of Ori- 
ental literature. He describes quiet hours in 
the Vatican Library, with Cardinal Mai for his 
sole companion, in the great hall of Manu- 
scripts, glowing with Zuccari's decorations. It 
is midsummer ; the very copyists are absent on 
their annual vacations. " The half-closed shut- 
ters and drawn curtains impart a drowsy atmos- 
phere to the delicious coolness, while the broil- 
ing sun glares on the square without." Tourists 
familiar with Italian galleries in August may 
suspect a lack of ventilation as having to do 
with the drowsiness. Wiseman, however, had 
become essentially an Italian ; and ventilation 
is not an Italian necessity. At all events, the 
drowsiness did not infect his style or his mat- 
ter. His " Horse Syriacse " is still an authority, 
respectfully noticed by scholars like Westcott 
and Tregelles. His reputation widened, and 
Germans like Niebuhr and Tholuck and Bunsen 
became his correspondents. He was presently 
made Professor of Oriental Tongues in the 
Roman University. He read widely books that 
he could not always commend to others. The 
early stages of Biblical criticism for a time dis- 
turbed his faith. He could confide his troubles 
to no one. The struggle went on for years, in 



which " he fought his doubts and gathered 
strength." Absorbed in spiritual conflict, he 
found the grosser temptations of his youth pass- 
ing him by scatheless. 

From 1828 he was for twelve years Rector 
of his college. He became a noted preacher to 
the English sojourners at Rome. Master of 
half a dozen languages, he could preach freely 
in Italian, French, and English. In the gift of 
tongues he was second to Mezzofanti only, and 
had something to say in several languages, 
which the greater linguist had not. He was 
well read in the literature of France, England, 
Germany, and Italy. He was a competent 
critic in art and music, an authority upon ritual, 
a collector of old china, and learned in stained 
glass. He ceased to be a cloistered student. 
He mingled more with men, and lived a richer 
and fuller life. With a constitutional shyness 
which he never quite shook off, and a demeanor 
that was " very grave, even a little pompous," 
he was natural and unaffected, a favorite guest, 
a cordial host. A story told at this time across a 
Roman dinner-table suggests that, even in the 
patrimony of St. Peter, life was a little primi- 
tive, not far removed from the civilization of an 
American frontier. An agent for a great estate 
in the country is about his work, when he feels 
a touch upon his shoulder. It proves that a 
native of the region is using him for a gun-rest ; 
presently there is a report, and the neighbor 
falls. The agent looks around for some expla- 
nation. " That is nothing," says the slayer ; 
" He was a bad fellow." The climate seemed 
unwholesome, and the agent withdrew without 
delay to Rome, like any "tenderfoot" to-day. 

It was in the year 1830 that Wiseman began 
to think that a work lay before him in England. 
He dreamed of that fair land as no longer in 
schism but restored to its Catholic heritage. 
The vision haunted him. To realize it became 
the purpose of his life. For this he laid aside 
his scholarly preoccupations and became the 
man of affairs. The Oxford Movement was not 
yet above the horizon. Nine years later, an 
article of Wiseman's on Augustine and the 
Donatists pierced through a rift in Newman's 
Anglican armor wherein he had trusted, and 
touched his very life. For him the cherished 
via Media was no longer possible. Between 
frank adherence to the Papacy and frank oppo- 
sition, between " the Scylla of Yes and the 
Charybdis of No," there was no longer for him 
any footing. The article " gave me a stomach- 
ache," he said. The attack grew chronic, and 
the patient never rallied.

In 1840 Wiseman was elevated to the epis- 
copate, and set over Oscott College in England, 
" not to educate a few boys, but to be the 
rallying-point of a yet silent but vast move- 
ment." He found much among his fellow 
Catholics which chilled and benumbed him, but 
in Pugin the architect he discovered one man 
after his own heart, who shared his fervid zeal 
and sympathized with his tropical luxuriance of 
speech. Pagin refused to admit that a truly 
devout soul could pray in a hideous building. 
The least piety would take him out of it. The 
architect's taste was all for pointed Gothic, and 
the Bishop's took more kindly to Roman Re- 
naissance ; but they could merge such differ- 
ences in their common enthusiasm for Catholic 
Symbolism. Each superabundantly loved cere- 
monial pomp and gorgeous vestments. Each 
held dramatic what others pronounced theatri- 
cal. Wiseman saw in splendid " functions " a 
reflection of the Church in its glory, going forth 
arrayed for conquest. To him they were all 
" a perpetual feast of nectared sweets." There 
are those who cannot finish the quotation, 
" Where no crude surfeit reigns." There is 
somewhat too much in his delight in them. We 
are cloyed while he is unsatisfied. Perhaps we 
are not Celtic, nor Italian, nor Iberian. He 
was all three in one complex personality. 

When " Tract No. 90 " was issued, all En- 
gland was stirred. This, said onlooking Oscott, 
" means business." Was it so, indeed, that 
priests could sign the thirty-nine articles, yet 
hold all the doctrine of Trent ? The Bishops 
were not of that opinion, nor were the mass of 
the laity ; only a few of the clergy were pre- 
pared to go so far. Those few were soon to go 
farther. They were already nearing the plunge. 
Their chief held his peace and meditated apart. 
But he could not resist the current. There are 
steep grades where there can be no midway 
pausing. He had adopted premises of which 
Rome was the logical conclusion. It was but 
a question of time. Wiseman chafed while 
Newman ruminated. The Anglican doctor 
dreamed of Roman concessions, of the reunion 
of the Papacy and the Church of England upon 
equal terms. The Roman Bishop had no terms 
to offer but those of unconditional surrender. 
The Exclusive Church stood still and calmly 
waited. At last Mahomet took his step towards 
the immovable mountain. Ward and Newman 
" went over." Keble and Pusey, with less 
severity of logic, stopped on the brink. The 
Oxford Movement broke abruptly in the 
middle. 



It was a tragic history to those racked and 
rent seekers for authority in religion, but it had 
its comical episodes. Symbolism furnished one 
of them. Towards the close of Newman's long 
hesitation, Wiseman sent a former curate of 
Newman's, a Roman convert, to Littlemore, 
to note any signs of an approaching decision. 
He returned confident that the end was near. 
By what did he judge ? What had Newman 
said ? Scarce a word ; but he had on gray 
trousers. To one who knew his exactness in 
clerical attire, it was enough. Plainly, he held 
himself no longer to be in orders. No wonder 
that Wiseman doubted. But the trousers had 
a voice. They were prophetic, and soon the 
plunge was made. 

Naturally, Wiseman's sanguine imagination 
saw half England following close upon New- 
man's heels. He was mistaken. Yet he was 
not without reason for his exultant mood. The 
English Church is stronger to-day than ever. 
Yet what the Roman Bishops especially valued 
has deeper root on English soil than at any 
previous period since the Reformation. The 
English Papist no longer suffers from legal or 
social disabilities. The day of Protestant intol- 
erance of all Catholic uses is at an end. The 
soundest pillar of Reformed doctrine is no longer 
alarmed at crosses on church gables, at flowers 
and candles, at a transfiguration or crucifixion 
on his chancel wall, at a Lord's supper above 
the Holy Table, at carven saints about the 
porch, at splendid glass or shining brass or 
embroidered altar-cloths. He may favor broth- 
erhoods and sisterhoods, he may read and talk 
of the Lives of the Saints, without coming 
under the suspicion that rested upon Bishop 
Butler. He may hear confessions, in his study 
or his chapel, from released convicts or guile- 
less spinsters, without causing a shudder to his 
brother clergy. He may even pray for the dead 
and no bishop rebuke his godly liberty. It may 
not be all that Newman hoped or Wiseman 
anticipated. It is far more than Keble and Pusey 
at the outset of the Oxford Movement could 
have looked for. The Anglican Church has 
wonderfully revived, its life has deepened, its 
range broadened. The expansion has been not 
wholly Romeward. It has gone towards Ger- 
many also. It has turned back towards the day 
of undivided Christendom. It has reached for- 
ward towards the re-united Church of the Fu- 
ture. Above all, it has sweetened and mellowed. 
The hard distrusts, the narrow bigotries, the 
caitiff panics, are things past. If the Anglican 
Churchman to-day holds out a hand to the ven-

erable bishop who sits enthroned in the Vatican, 
he holds out a hand also to the venerable breth- 
ren who from dissenting pulpits and continental 
class-rooms are telling of Jesus Christ and 
throwing their light upon what His Church 
should be. In this large result, both Newman 
and Wiseman bore their part. In many re- 
spects they builded better than they knew. It 
is a worthier Christendom for their life and 
labor. Few Catholics to-day indulge their old- 
time contempt for the Protestant ; few Puri- 
tans to-day shiver in dread of the Papist and 
the Jesuit. It were hard to find a churchman 
to-day who would regret to be too feeble to stick 
a knife into a dissenter, whether of the Roman 
or the Sandemanian variety. Sydney Smith's 
jest, thanks largely to Sydney Smith's manly 
and sober earnest, has lost its point. Men of 
modern minds are able to conceive of the sur- 
vival of men of mediaeval minds, and ultra- 
montanes like Ward indulge a large hope that 
agnostics like Huxley may be saved by virtue 
of their " invincible ignorance." The hearts of 
Christian people have been drawn together, and 
there is an increasing unity of the spirit that 
links James Martineau at one end with Leo 
XIII. at the other. No better evidence of its 
working need be sought than is to be found in 
this genial and just Life of Cardinal Wiseman. 
It in no way resembles that other recent biog- 
raphy of a Prince of the Roman Church which 
might be entitled " Working Specifications for 
the Construction of an Ecclesiastical Machine, 
by an Expert." 

Wiseman had been ten years in England, 
had been advanced from Bishop to Cardinal, 
when in a single moment it seemed as if his 
pacificatory work was undone and that the cry 
of " No Popery " was to ring out loud and harsh 
as ever. In a pastoral " from the Flaminian 
Gate " he had announced in a tone rashly ex- 
ultant the reestablishment in England of a 
Roman hierarchy. He was to be no longer 
Bishop in partibus, but Cardinal Archbishop 
of Westminster, with all the land parcelled out 
into titular districts, beneath his sway. His 
irrepressible enthusiasm at such a step forward 
at once aroused suspicion. John Bull went off 
into a characteristic panic. Was the Reform- 
ation clean forgot ? Was the land of Latimer 
and Ridley to be once more a papal heritage ? 
There was not the least ground for alarm. 
There was not one papist more for all the sound- 
ing titles of the hierarchy. The soil was par- 
celled out by lines as imaginary as the equator. 
But the popular mind was all agog. Wiseman 



was at first amazed, then amused, then calmly 
determined. Whoever lost his head, it was not 
he. Boldly he confronted the mobs of gentle 
and simple that trembled with wrath and indig- 
nation. The religious press, with " The Times " 
and " Punch " to lead the fray, was furious. 
Wiseman's biographer can heartily laugh at 
those clever cartoons which lost " Punch " 
henceforth the cooperation of Richard Doyle. 
We suspect that the Cardinal himself enjoyed 
them. After all, it was not libellous to liken 
him to Wolsey, and it was not Wiseman who suf- 
fered most at the caricaturist's hands, but vacil- 
lating Lord John Russell, depicted as a naughty 
boy who chalks " No Popery " on the Cardinal's 
door and takes to his heels. The Cardinal did 
not take to his heels, and the tempest proved 
to be but a passing blow. A good many years 
have gone by since, and the Papal Aggression 
is a forgotten bugbear. Not yet is the Spanish 
Inquisition domesticated under the shadow of 
the Abbey. Those who fostered the preposter- 
ous panic were not long proud of their work, 
and the act of Parliament which recorded it 
was a dead letter from the outset. 

The Cardinal's later years were embittered, 
not by any popular opposition, but by feuds and 
intrigues within his own ecclesiastical house- 
hold. With declining health and failing en- 
ergy, he found himself called upon to be a vain 
peacemaker, where rival ambitions came in 
sharp conflict. There is a good deal of human 
nature remaining in man even after ordination. 
Perhaps celibate man is peculiarly subject to 
strifes and contentions. The " inevitable wo- 
man " who may trouble the married priest is 
not more perilous than the conflicts of author- 
ity, the quest for power, that beset those whose 
church is their only spouse. M. Fabre has a 
striking story in which the feminine element is 
quite absent, and clerical intrigue supplies, very 
sufficiently, interest to the plot. The Cardinal 
had to deal with two subordinates, men of 
intense will concentrated upon ecclesiastical 
affairs. His coadjutor, an ecclesiastical mar- 
tinet, an English Catholic of the old stock, be- 
came intolerable in his rigidity. He had as 
coadjutor the right of succession to the Arch- 
bishopric, and conscientiously assumed the duty 
of perpetual interference in Wiseman's lifetime. 
The situation became impossible. It grew to 
be a personal contest between Bishop Errington, 
who was in immediate authority as coadjutor, 
and Dr. Manning, who afterwards succeeded 
him. Wiseman was naturally by birth and train- 
ing a Roman Catholic, and took his church pecu-

liarities easily. Errington, who had belonged 
to a proscribed class in his youth, and Mann- 
ing, who as a recent convert overemphasized 
his ultramontanism, could not pull together. 
At last Errington, who had refused to resign, 
was withdrawn by the intervention of the Pope. 
Manning henceforward had the ascendancy. 
Wiseman, not in judgment and feeling, but in 
practical conduct, fell more under the control 
of the stronger, which was not always the wiser, 
will. The Roman organization perhaps gained. 
It is not clear that the Catholic spirit gained 
equally. One seems to discern the outcropping 
of occasional doubt in this regard in the mind 
of the biographer. 

When, on February 15, 1865, after a quarter 
of a century of authority in England, Cardinal 
Wiseman went to his rest, his contemporaries 
of all schools recognized that they had lost a 
great prelate and a large-hearted man. His 
last days were of protracted suffering, which he 
had borne with a sweet patience and submis- 
sion, sustained by undoubting faith. The strug- 
gles of his youth had been forgotten. There 
were no clouds obscuring his spiritual vision. 
He had toiled much, and his work had been 
crowned with success. He had written much ; 
if it had no permanent quality, yet it had served 
its purpose well. He had been a man of learn- 
ing, of letters, of affairs. Natural as a child, 
he had been a lover of children, and they re- 
paid his love in full measure. They could not 
be persuaded that he was ugly ; they only knew 
that he was their friend. So far as this biog- 
raphy reveals him, women had at no time been 
influential in his life, though he had been a 
good son to his mother, who had devoted him 
to his great career. Like all busy men, he had 
loved idleness, and in talk of books and art and 
men delighted to roll out his mind. He was 
curious as to all sorts of knowledge, which he 
drew at first-hand from living experts, and 
liked freely to impart his new stores in their 
first freshness of acquisition. The variety of 
his interests, the versatility of his genius, gave 
him access to many differing minds. He was 
in the best sense a man of the world, a cour- 
teous, sympathetic gentleman. His presence 
was imposing, with a ruddy face and tall and 
portly frame. In manner he was simple, a little 
shy and reserved and dignified, at heart sensi- 
tive and affectionate. He hated the drudgery 
and petty details of office, yet could work prodi- 
giously with thorough grasp of the whole field. 
He dreaded adverse criticism, and shrank from 
public controversy, yet needed a crisis to bring 



him to his best. Excited in moments of seem- 
ing victory, he was always cool under fire, with 
every faculty at command. His imagination was 
slightly in excess, and sometimes unduly pre- 
ponderant. It made him over-impressionable, 
and now and then capricious. It lent its charm 
and color to his luxuriant Ciceronian eloquence. 
It made him a ready improvisatore in Latin, 
English, and Italian. His verse is loose in text- 
ure, but flowing and melodious. His style 
lacked compression. It could never be said of 
him, in Lander's phrase, that he " inspissated 
his yellows into blacks." There was ever the 
something too much of facile genius. He loved, 
in diction as in life, splendor for its own sake. 
He liked his state as Prince of the Church. 
He graciously vested himself in his official 
robes to furnish Charles Kean the correct cos- 
tume for Cardinal Wolsey. Servants doted 
upon him, though one good cook refused to 
imperil his soul by broiling him a prescribed 
chop on a Friday. He was not insensible to 
good cheer, and had " a lobster-salad side as 
well as a spiritual side." His was a generous 
southern temperament, and Spaniards and 
Italians were more at home with him than the 
denizens of the chilly North. He was rich in 
humor, which diffused itself through his genial 
demeanor. Above all, he was an honest man, 
pure and good, a worthy dignitary. His spirit 
was devout. His mood was of faith and worked 
by love. The Roman Church may well be proud 
of giving him birth and nurture, of recognizing 
his gifts, and setting him in her high places of 
authority. It may be questioned if every Prot- 
estant denomination could breed just such a 
man, or would know precisely what to do with 
him. The Roman Catholic Church has its nar- 
row doors and cramped vestibules, but there 
seems room and verge enough for those who 
are fairly inside. The air may be a little dense, 
overladen with incense, and the glass here and 
there obstructive of light ; but there are no 
fixed pews to divide the floor, and there are 
side aisles and chapels for quiet refuges. If 
you do n't insist upon too much ventilation, you 
can do as well perhaps at St. Peter's as in Salem 
Chapel, which has restrictions of its own.

CONSTITUTIONAL, QUESTIONS, NORTH 
AND SOUTH.* 

Judge Emory Speer, of the Federal Court 
of the Southern District of Georgia, is so well 
known as a lawyer and a judge, not only of the 
highest accomplishments but of eminently sound 
and catholic judgment, that one turns with un- 
usual interest the pages of a book from him on 
constitutional questions. Of South Carolina 
ancestry, of Georgian birth and life, and speak- 
ing in these pages originally to law students of 
a Southern university, the opportunity was a 
notable one. But the very dedication of the 
book gives the key-note to what follows, and 
assures the confidence of the reader. It runs : 

" To my father, Eustace W. Speer, D.D., an exem- 
plar of the Christian patriot, who early taught his chil- 
dren that love of our common country he inherited from 
patriot sires." 

This thin volume, so beautifully prepared by a 
Southern publishing house, is a gratifying pro- 
duct of that new South which so many this side 
the Ohio are yet loth to recognize. Speaking 
of these lectures in the preface, Judge Speer 



" It is gratifying to believe that after many formid- 
able assaults and misguiding interpretations, from time 
to time aimed at the indispensable and inherent powers 
of the noble instrument to which they relate, its estab- 
lished efficacy for all the essentials of National Govern- 
ment has won for it lasting popular confidence and the 
anxious desire of enlightened Americans to master its 
principles. Indeed, there is now known of all men in 
all sections of our country the priceless value of the 
truth expressed by Washington in his Farewell Address. 
' The Union is the edifice of our real independence, the 
support of our tranquility at home, our peace abroad, 
our prosperity, our safety, and the very liberty which 
we so highly prize; and for this Union we should cher- 
ish a cordial, habitual, immovable attachment, and 
should discountenance whatever may suggest even a 
suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned.' The 
author, engaged for nearly thirteen years with judicial 
duties largely involving the enforcement of the National 
laws among Southern people, is enabled to certify that 
this truth is as dear to the intelligent Southern men of 
to-day as to Hamilton, the brilliant projector of the Con- 
stitution; to Madison, its incomparable advocate; to 
Marshall, its great expounder; and to the illustrious 
Washington himself." 

This is a high tribute, from a high source, 
to the sanity of thinking of the intelligent por- 
tion of the South on a fundamental matter ; 
and in view of the doctrine of Federal power 
advanced in the body of the book, we may ac- 
cept it as impartial and authoritative. Cer-

tainly no judge reared in New England of Fed- 
eralist ancestors could take firmer nationalist 
ground than does Judge Speer in the fifth lec- 
ture, on the eighteenth and last clause of Sec- 
tion 8 Article I. of the Constitution its En- 
abling Act. That the Supreme Court is the 
final interpreter of questions involving the 
Constitution, where the individual is concerned, 
is clearly stated, as follows : 

" Wherever the rights of the citizen may be affected 
by a particular governmental act, whether it be an act 
of Congress or the State legislature, or of an executive 
or judiciary functionary, either of the State or of the 
United States, if it be capable of submission to a court 
having jurisdiction, the final and common arbiter of the 
constitutional question is the supreme judicial authority 
of the courts of the United States. In such cases the 
final decision of that authority is binding upon all the 
people, all the states, and all the departments of the 
general government." 

At the same time, it is shown, as a matter of 
fact, that in many cases the Executive or Con- 
gress may decide that it is constitutional to act 
in a certain manner, and so act, when the man- 
ner of action is wholly outside the purposes of 
the Constitution. 

" The constitutional corrective for such wrongs is the 
vote of the people at the next appropriate election. The 
decision of the executive as to the constitutionality of a 
measure has been found to be at times practically irre- 
vocable, even after the decision of the Supreme Court 
had pronounced otherwise." 

But all this only emphasizes the supreme 
authority, of both act and interpretation, of the 
federal government as a whole, subject only to 
revision by the sovereign people. This is good 
doctrine of the school of Washington and Ham- 
ilton and Marshall. 

One or two misprints are noticed, as the 
formation of the Ohio Company in 1849, and 
the signature of the Treaty of Paris in 1782. 
It is hardly accurate to speak of the Rock ing- 
ham ministry of 1765 as a Tory ministry ; and 
Judge Speer could not mean to say of the 
Quebec Act of 1775, that " it proposed to make 
all the New England and Middle States a part 
of the province of Canada." The range of that 
famous act stopped on the south and east at the 
Ohio River and Lake Ontario. 

One is not so sure of the book on " Nullifi- 
cation and Secession." Mr. Powell means well, 
for he says : 

" It is my desire to state facts as viewed from a 
strictly national, rather than from a sectional or partisan, 
standpoint. But it is not without the sphere of legiti- 
mate history to aid, by such a statement of facts, in 
creating a more generous national sentiment, and a con- 
viction on the part of all sections that political right- 
eousness has not been the exclusive property of any one

part of the United States. It is time to deal justly by 
the South, and recognize its full share in the better part 
of nation-building, while at the same time we do not 
overlook the diverse obligations that naturally fell upon 
the complementary sections. In writing a history of 
attempts at nullification and secession, I shall not forget 
that they are the expressions of that intense individual- 
ism which was the most potent factor in creating our 
Republic." 

But this author does not always possess that 
clarity of vision which one who undertakes to 
create " a more generous national sentiment " 
should have. The book is dedicated " to the 
South as well as to the North, to the West as 
well as to the East, with a spirit of equal justice 
to all our common land, our indissoluble 
Union"; and the motto is borrowed from Lin- 
coln, " With malice toward none ; with charity 
for all." 

But in the attempt to do justice to the South 
and to the Southern exponents of state-rights 
doctrine, there is a constant disparagement of 
those in the North who opposed them, or fell 
into the same way of thinking when it served 
their turn ; and the presentation of all the expo- 
nents of the old Federalism, from Hamilton 
down, is tinged with something at least as strong 
as malice. It can serve no useful purpose 
least of all that of reconciling " the sections " 
to constantly disparage the leaders of thought 
over large areas of time and of country. We 
are constantly given insinuation and innuendo 
for history. We are told that Otis " offered a 
resolution that no foreign-born person should 
hereafter hold an office in the United States," 
and that " it was probably provoked by the fact 
that Gallatin, a Swiss, at this time was rapidly 
rising to eminent leadership of the Republi- 
cans." One of John Marshall's decisions is 
labelled " this zigzag of facts "; and it is added, 
" the confusion of trying to distinguish be- 
tween state governments and the people is 
absurd." But history has not assigned confu- 
sion and absurdity to the mind of John Mar- 
shall. Mr. Powell knows it to be " a fact that 
Hamilton, together with Pickering, had on foot 
a secret plot with Great Britain to engage in a 
joint plundering expedition against Spanish 
possessions in America." Of Hamilton, we read 
that " he quarrelled in turn with every promi- 
nent man with whom his lot was cast. As a 
mere aid, he had flouted Washington, who 
petted him and humored him as he humored no 
other. He violently assailed and abused Adams. 
He shamelessly maligned Jefferson ; and Burr 
he traduced as a scoundrel." When Washington 
steadily refuses to appoint Burr to an important 



office, we are asked, " Was this the keen insight 
of a great mind ; or was it the result of the 
enmity of Hamilton ? " We learn that " the 
irrepressible but detestable Timothy Pickering 
bobbed once more into publicity. With a her- 
edity of several generations of self-glorification, 
in being ' chosen of God,' he mixed religion and 
politics with such skill that he could baptize 
any meanness, and serve the Lord with any 
dishonor." We read that Governeur Morris 
was " a fussy creature, who had more influence 
than he deserved." We are told that Jackson 
" stole Texas," but are not given the date. One 
is surprised also to learn of Charleston, that 
"the religion was Calvinistic and Presbyterian." 

It is a pity that Mr. Powell should be so 
vituperative, for, apart from its abuse of every 
exponent of the older Federalism, the book is 
laid down on sound principles. The sympa- 
thetic view taken of Jefferson is in accord with 
what is becoming more and more a national 
estimate of that truly great man. The portrai- 
ture of Calhoun is discriminating, and is well 
done. 

" His ideal of life was out of sight beyond that of 
Jackson and Clay and Crawford. Nearer akin to Jef- 
ferson in views and character than any other public man 
of the era, he wholly lacked Jefferson's ability to widen 
with antagonism and expand with age. He believed in 
honesty, economy, and liberty. His doctrine of State 
Rights was the doctrine as it had stood in 1798. He 
drew back from nationalism ; he drew in from the com- 
bat at large. . . . He would yield nothing, bend nowhere. 
Of necessity he dropped down to State leadership and 
State rights and State institutions. To become the 
champion of slavery because slavery was a State insti- 
tution was the final lot of a man apparently born to be 
the greatest national leader of his era. 

" The State stamp was a deep and indelible one. It 
did not breed nationalists, but it bred its strongest char- 
acters to look inward instead of outward. Nullification 
was a natural consequence. Its association with slavery 
was an incident, not a provoking cause. The deep cause 
of action in two rebellions was State character." 

Having in six chapters dealt with as many 
attempts to nullify or to secede, from 1798 to 
1861, the author does some of his best writing 
in a concluding chapter on the problems of the 
period since 1865, when the era of faction 
closed. Under the topics, the Negro Problem, 
the Problem of Ignorance, the Problem of 
Expansion, Spoliation of the Rich, Spoliation 
of the Poor, Protection of Special Industries, 
Centralization, Failure of Popular Government, 
he asks some pertinent questions and indicates 
some present dangerous tendencies. Nowhere 
has a more forcible impeachment of class legis- 
lation been written than under the sixth head.

Washington is ever present to many good 
Federalists to-day who cherish a Nation but 
fear a Juggernaut, and Mr. Powell voices the 
convictions of many a less impetuous mind than 
his own. Yet he should have known that to 
General Grant is due the credit of initiating 
the policy of withdrawing the Federal troops 
from the South a policy which Mr. Hayes 
approved and carried out. Although one takes 
issue with Mr. Powell's invective, it is impos- 
sible not to enjoy intellectually his trenchant 
and epigrammatic English in an age of much 
diffuse vapidity. General Wilkinson, the one 
victim of his trenchant style who deserves 
nearly all that is said of him, is thus disposed 
of in a parting sentence : " He spent his old 
age on an estate in Mexico bought with the 
profits of his treason. There he wrote a much 
more reputable Life than he had succeeded in 
living." JOHN J. HALSEY. 



ENGLISH STATESMAN IN EGYPT.* 

Sir Alfred Milner, in his work on " En- 
gland in Egypt," makes frequent reference to 
Sir Evelyn Baring. " The stars were indeed 
gracious," he says, " when, at the beginning of 
our greatest troubles, it occurred to the British 
Government to entrust the conduct of its policy 
to the hands of Sir Evelyn Baring." Under the 
latter name Lord Cromer is probably better 
known to the world at large, as it was only in 1892 
that he was raised to the peerage, several years 
after the occurrence of those events in Anglo- 
Egyptian history which first brought his name 
into general notice, and which now furnish a 
large portion of the material of Mr. H. D. 
Traill's elaborate Biography. 

Sir Evelyn Baring was born in 1841, edu- 
cated at the Woolwich Academy, and served 
ten or twelve years as an artillery officer ; be- 
came in 1873 private secretary to Lord North- 
brook, Viceroy of India ; was appointed in 
1877 English Commissioner of the Egyptian 
Debt ; in 1879 was made joint member with 
M. de Blignieres of the Dual Control estab- 
lished for the purpose of inquiring into all 
branches of the Egyptian public service, with 
the rank of minister and a seat in the cabinet ; 
succeeded Sir John Strachey as Financial 
Member of the Council of India in 1880 ; and 
in 1883 was sent back to Cairo as Consul-

trated. New York : Edward Arnold. 



General with the rank of minister plenipoten- 
tiary in the diplomatic service. This office, 
unless we are mistaken, he still holds. 

More than three-quarters of Mr. Traill's 
book is devoted to Baring's record as Consul- 
General, for which post his earlier training in 
the finances both of India and of Egypt was a 
valuable preparation. The financial situation 
in Egypt has for many years been the one 
problem in that country pressing for solution, 
and it is largely due to Lord Cromer's mas- 
terly grasp of the situation and firm insistence 
on certain wise reforms, especially in the mat- 
ter of less lavish expenditure, that the country 
has escaped bankruptcy and is in a solvent 
condition to-day. His service to Egypt in se- 
curing the appropriation by its government, in 
1885, of a million pounds for the irrigation 
works, cannot be overestimated ; nor can his 
firmness and wisdom in keeping under such 
admirable control, with Lord Roseberry at the 
Foreign Office to back him, the headstrong and 
petulant youth of eighteen who succeeded Tew- 
fik Pasha as Khedive, in 1892, and straightway 
endeavored to surround himself with a worth- 
less crew of ministers and advisers. Indeed, 
the entire record of Lord Cromer's life in 
Egypt may serve as an argument to convince 
the skeptical that the mission of England in 
Egypt is after all a beneficent one. 

Mr. Traill tells once more the sad story of 
General Gordon's mission to the Soudan, and 
the criminally timid and dilatory policy of the 
second Gladstone administration, to which the 
world has agreed to ascribe the tragic death 
of the hero. The tale is rehearsed in order to 
clear of all blame the Consul- General at Cairo, 
who acted as intermediary between Gordon and 
the home government, and transmitted to 
Downing Street those repeated appeals for aid 
even if it should be only a hundred, only 
fifty men which came from Khartoum day 
after day and month after month, but were un- 
heeded until too late. Lord Cromer is shown 
by his biographer to have been technically 
blameless in the matter ; and yet one is tempted 
to query whether another man in his place 
perhaps one far less skilled in diplomacy and 
less distinguished as a financier might not 
have taken such positive action, whether offi- 
cially or unofficially, as to effect Gordon's res- 
cue. The pity of it all is that Gordon's sacrifice 
was so needless, and his relief, even with all the 
blundering and delay, was so nearly accom- 
plished. 

The biographer speaks, with reason, of the

REASON AND FAITH.* 



The authority of reason can never be shaken, for 
we have only reason with which to pluck it down. 
Faith cannot be escaped, for reason involves it. Our 
ever-returning confidence in reason, in spite of its 
inadequate and conflicting results, is an act of faith 
in truth, faith in our own relations to it, faith in the 
divinely ordered movement by which it is being 
reached. We see in part, is the formula of life. 
We see : of that we are sure. We see in part only : 
hence these delays and contradictions. Many seek- 
ers, scattered in a dense forest, are shouting to each 
other, and trying to find the path. The confusion 
is a confusion of order ; the bewilderment is one 
that is passing away. One feels at no other time 
the magnitude of the spiritual world, in which for 
the moment we seem to be lost, so much as when he 
hears the cries, near and far, " This is the way." 

The many friends of Professor Drummond will 
be thankful for " The Ideal Life." It opens with 
two loving sketches of him by Dr. W. Robertson 
Nicoll and Ian Maclareu. The bulk of the volume 
is made up of brief, penetrative, and profoundly 
earnest discourses. It opens with one on " 111 Tem-

per," conceived in the best spirit of the author. 
Professor Drummond won loving and widely scat- 
tered attention by his very eager grasp of spiritual 
things, united with a firm hold on physical facts. 
He gave himself heartily to the true problem of life, 
the reconciliation of these two. In this work, he 
met with much success ; but this achievement was 
of chief value because in his own mind and heart he 
sacrificed nothing of the goal in reaching it. The 
goal was assured, whatever might be determined as 
to any particular path to it. 

" The Ritschlian Theology," by Dr. James Orr, is 
an interesting and well-written book. It is at once 
appreciative and critical. It is a thorough presenta- 
tion of a method of thought that has gained ground 
rapidly in Germany, and is fitted materially to modify 
questions of proof in matters of faith. The view of 
Professor Ritschl tends to make the argument for 
Christianity relatively independent of the historical 
facts which accompanied its birth and can be restored 
only partially and with difficulty, and rests it upon 
Christianity as a present spiritual fact, undeniable 
in its nature, and which we can judge in its intrinsic 
force. This is a position which deserves the exhaus- 
tive discussion it receives in the volume before us. 

" A National Church " is composed of two lec- 
tures by the Rev. W. R. Huntington ; the first pre- 
sents the theory of a national church, while the 
second lecture defends its practicability. The book 
differs from the current discussion which the topic 
has called forth in dropping down to the more mod- 
est and less logical purpose of a national, in place 
of a universal, church. The lectures are rhetorical 
rather than powerful. They will encourage those 
already convinced, but will make no inroad on the 
refractory. The dispersion and division of religious 
faiths are no unfortunate accident, but are incident to 
an inevitable and progressive movement the asser- 
tion of an independent, personal religious life. Not 
till this force has so far expended itself as to leave 
us ready for a more vital union on a higher plane, 
shall we begin to rebuild churches in a larger spirit. 

" The significance of the Westminster Standards," 
by Dr. Benjamin B. Warfield, is a denominational 
address to a rigidly denominational audience the 
Presbytery of New York. Its character is suffi- 
ciently indicated by this early assertion : " In these 
forms of words we possess the most complete, the 
most fully elaborated and carefully guarded, the 
most perfect, and the most vital expression that has 
ever been framed by the hand of man, of all that 
enters into what we call evangelical religion, and of 
all that must be safeguarded if evangelical religion 
is to persist in the world." This assertion the author 
seeks to establish historically and reflectively. 

" Ministerial Priesthood " is the product of a 
vigorous and ardent mind. Like most books of this 
character, it is well worth reading ; if not for con- 
viction, yet for comprehension. To the easy-going 
Protestant with whom the diversities of churches 
belong to the accidents of life, the methods of thought 
which pertain to an earnest churchman are a revela-

tion. They broaden his spiritual horizon and ex- 
tend his sympathies. The ruling ideas of the book 
are, that Christianity involves of necessity a com- 
plete ideal relation between men that organic life 
which we know as a church ; that the internal power 
of the church cannot be separated from its external 
form ; that the two, therefore, must inhere in one 
definite and transcendant product. From these 
premises the author infers that our spiritual devel- 
opment must lie along a single line of church de- 
velopment. The vigorous enforcement of these ideas 
will certainly be corrective to many minds. The 
view which has much logical force within itself 
seems, however, to be constructed in oversight, if 
not in contempt, of the actual stages of growth in 
the world. The perfect church, like a perfect gov- 
ernment or a perfect family, is reached through many 
imperfect ones, with ever renewed selection and re- 
jection. To cling obstinately to the old is oftentimes 
to aid its demerits in smothering its merits. Our 
church ideal is still in the air like all our other ideals. 
" Buddhism and its Christian Critics " is a care- 
ful and illuminating statement, by Dr. Paul Carus, 
of the ideas which underlie Buddhism. We have 
no doubt of the essential correctness of the treatise 
as an exposition of that faith, nor of its fitness to 
remove much of the disagreement and doubt asso- 
ciated with previous statements. The author has 
rendered a good service. The underlying idea of 
the system, which the author also entertains, we are 
not, however, prepared to accept. We are quite 
content to reject the Brahminic notion of a distinct, 
permanent self, the source of mental phenomena. 
This is doubling a thing : putting a second thing 
within the thing as a means of exposition. We are 
not, however, shut up to a mere flow of phenomena, 
a series of forms, as the only counter conception. 
The phenomena which address themselves to the 
senses or to consciousness carry with them to the 
intellect, the energy, physical or spiritual, which 
sustains them. The substance and form are insep- 
arable correlatives the same thing differently re- 
garded. If this were not so, then the chariot and 
the man a comparison frequently employed in the 
exposition would indeed stand on the same basis. 
The chariot is made up of its parts, and the man of 
his parts. Suppose the chariot to be suddenly en- 
dowed with life, to have a spirit in the wheels : it 
would have suffered no change, under the view 
urged, as its parts would remain the same. As a 
matter of fact, however, the hidden connections 
would be totally altered. Evolution involves as dis- 
tinctly that which is evolved, as the forms through 
which it passes. Take the case most favorable to 
this theory of forms simply, that of the triangle. 
Suppose a given right-angled triangle : enlarge it 
indefinitely. As long as it remains a distinct tri- 
angle, the relations hold. Let it begin to lose its 
parts for the mind by virtue of magnitude, and their 
relations disappear with them ; it is by virtue only 
of a concrete triangle that we hold them fast. Just 
here has arisen the confusion as to what is meant 



by Nirvana. Take away all concrete experience, 
and what is left? Nothing, says one; pure form, 
says another. But pure form is inseparable from 
concrete form. It is concrete, or it ceases to be. 
By pursuing an abstraction, by being lost in the last 
abstraction, Buddhism is infinitely inferior to Chris- 
tianity. It partially regains its ground by affirming 
virtually that pure form is perfect form, and then 
pursuing perfection as the highest form. We think 
the author is open to the criticism a criticism 
which certainly attaches to many in our time of 
making the words science and scientific a kind of 
fetich. His theory of the ultimate nature of things 
must, like other theories, fight its way through. It 
will prevail or fail according to its simplicity and 
aptness. It is vain to call it scientific, as if science 
stood for some form of absolute knowledge, and was 
applicable to the opinions of the author, and not to 
those of other men. Our author has skill as a tax- 
idermist ; but he is so delighted with it that he turns 
all the life of the world into a collection of stuffed 
skins, and then proceeds to pronounce them superior 
to the original creation. We have no criticism on 
the spirit of the book, but only on the ultimate phil- 
osophy which underlies it. 

" The Living Christ," by Mr. Paul Tyner, is a 
piece of mysticism, loving and tender, but quite 
away from the world in which we now are. The 
living Christ is to be understood in a literal sense. 
He has revealed himself to the author, and is to be 
revealed to all. The remote, fragile nature of the 
vision is made both painful and ludicrous, when we 
are told that the denouement is to take place in 
Denver. The infinite conceit of the human mind ! 
Like a caterpillar, it steals away into some crevice, 
spins its cocoon, and thinks the whole world is going 
through the same change. 

Dr. Beverley Warner's book on " The Facts and 
The Faith " is the result of a series of discourses on 
the Apostles' Creed. Its spirit is of the best. Its 
effort is to unite once more in a living faith tradi- 
tional dogma and growing knowledge. The atti- 
tude of the author is a frank, receptive one. He 
has no fear of eating of the tree of knowledge, or 
any expectation that the sources of faith will be 
dried up by its fruits. The world, as a divine pro- 
duct, has such hold on his mind that the method of 
control and guidance becomes a question of ever- 
renewed interest and inquiry. The work will be 
helpful to many in making the transition, so often 
found difficult, from a less adequate to a more ade- 
quate faith ; from a fixed to a flexible expression of 
truth. It will restore movement to the vital centres 
of spiritual growth. 

Dr. Trever's volume of " Studies in Comparative 
Theology " is based on six lectures given at Law- 
rence University, Wisconsin. The present size of 
the book would indicate considerable expansion of 
the matter from its first form. It treats in three 
lectures of The Vedic Religion, of Buddhism, of 
Zoroaster, and Moses. The three following lectures 
are on " The Religion of Abraham's Jft Boyhood

Home," " The Sphinx's Cry for Light," "The Voice 
of the Gospel to Other Religions." The book indi- 
cates wide knowledge. It is popular, instructive, 
and interesting. It is likely to bring pleasure and 
profit to many readers. Its spirit is intelligent and 
liberal. The criticisms that one might be disposed 
to make are secondary rather than fundamental. 

" Christianity, the World-Religion " is a replica- 
tion of Dr. Barrows's previous work on " The Par- 
liament of Religions." The extraordinary energy 
shown by him on tbat occasion has made him an 
institution by himself. One of the suggestions of 
that event has been the lecture course established by 
Mrs. Caroline E. Haskell ; the lectures to be delivered 
in Calcutta or some other city of India. The vol- 
ume before us contains seven lectures delivered in 
Calcutta, repeated elsewhere, and accompanied by 
many addresses given in the course of an extended 
tour in India and the East. It also contains a 
sketch, by the Rev. Robert A. Hume, D.D., of 
Ahmednagar, of the visit of Dr. Barrows to India 
and Japan. Dr. Barrows gives great magnitude 
to the ideas which occupy him, and fills full all 
their spaces with an inexhaustible enthusiasm. His 
style is like his method of activity. Many from all 
quarters are made to contribute to the book in hand. 
Dr. Barrows's trip was not the opening of a reli- 
gious bazaar, in which different views and convic- 
tions might be mingled and exchanged, but a steady 
enforcement of Christianity as the true world- 
religion. He strengthened the missionaries of the 
faith who preach it as the especial revelation of God. 
His themes were such subjects as " The World-wide 
Aspects of Christianity," "The Universal Book," 
"The Universal Man and Saviour." 

Prof. G. Frederick Wright's work on " The Sci- 
entific Aspects of Christian Evidences " is one of 
marked ability. It is well fitted to give hesitancy 
and sobriety to almost anyone's opinion on the funda- 
mental data which underlie faith. The facile and 
self-confident methods into which destructive criti- 
cism so readily falls, meet an extended and just 
rebuke. Yet, on the other hand, we cannot but 
feel that the mind of the author is somewhat too 
much burdened by the desire to defend the earlier 
views. This appears, however, rather as an under- 
current than as an avowed object. It is one thing 
to urge the supernatural as an essential ingredient 
of faith, and another to accept it scrupulously as it 
offers itself in the Scriptures. The book is what it 
purports to be, a discursive discussion of the grounds 
of belief involved in Christianity. The inquiry is 
associated with accurate and extended knowledge ; 
reaches to many and very diverse particulars ; and 
is instructive and stimulating, whether we do or do 
not accept its exact conclusions. The earlier chap- 
ters point out with great clearness the fact that the 
foundations of belief involve the same difficulties, no 
matter what our starting points. The later chapters 
treat of historical and textual criticisms. The book 
was well worth writing, and hence it is well worth 
reading. JOHN BASCOM. 



INDUSTRIAL, DEMOCRACY, ASD OTHER 
STUDIES.* 

It is a singular pleasure to accompany such com- 
petent guides as Mr. and Mrs. Webb through the 
complications of English Trade Unionism. Before 
our less highly developed country lie the problems 
which the wage-workers of England have, in good 
measure, made clear to themselves and to the world. 
In all essentials, we must pursue the same road. As 
manufacturing industry, with its concentration of 
population, dominates our life and gathers men into 
factories and cities, we shall require all the wisdom 
of experience to find our way. 

The authors of this book regard Trade Unionism 
as the industrial side of democracy. Under the title 
" Trade Union Structure " falls the discussion of 
the evolution of governmental organization in local 
unions, provincial and national federations, and 
interunion relations. Not a little light is thrown 
upon the much-lauded schemes of the referendum, 
initiative, and instructed delegates. For a century 
these unions have been trying experiments with 
town-meeting government, and as their numbers and 
territory increased they have been compelled to 
adopt representative institutions. In political gov- 
ernment the nations have thought out, or groped 
their way to, the differentiation of professional rep- 
resentatives for legislation and expert administrators 
in civil service ; and in trade-unionism a similar evo- 
lution is discernible. The unit tends to be the whole 
trade and not the local association of craftsmen. 

In connection with the topic " Trade Union Func- 
tion,'' the authors treat the methods and the regu- 
lations employed by organized wage-workers to 
obtain their ends. The methods are classified as 
mutual insurance, collective bargaining, and legal 
enactments. The regulations cover the standard 
rate, normal day, sanitation and safety, new pro- 
cesses and machinery, continuity of employment, 
entrance into a trade, and the right to a trade. Each 
of these great concerns of the operative classes is 
treated with great minuteness of detail, keen insight, 
and apparent impartiality. The information comes 
first-hand from documents and personal observation. 
The severe criticism of the Trade Union Congress 
gives evidence that these sympathetic historians of 
the moment are not slavish admirers but critical 
friends. 

The chapter on the Standard Rate should be care- 
fully studied by those who sincerely desire to under- 
stand the movement. " Among trade-union regu- 
lations there is one which stands out as practically 
universal, namely, the insistence on payment accord- 
ing to some definite standard, uniform in its appli-

[April 16, 



cation." This principle is frequently misrepresented. 
The demand is for a minimum, not for a maximum, 
rate of wages. The employer can pay as much more 
as he chooses for persons of special skill. In some 
cases the more skillful have chosen to yield higher 
income for the sake of security, just as investors 
prefer low interest with good basis of credit to high 
interest when payment is uncertain. Only by main- 
taining a standard rate is there a possibility of col- 
lective bargaining. The individual workman, with 
the perishable commodity of day-labor to offer, is 
helpless. Individual bargaining leads straight to 
bondage. The reasons for desiring piece-wages in 
some occupations, and time-wages in others, are 
clearly explained. 

In contending for improved appliances for health 
and safety, the unions have rendered a service to 
national efficiency, and they have been sustained by 
instructed public opinion. The unions can no longer 
be justly charged with opposition to machinery ; 
they are organized to secure their share of the 
increased product. The tragical suffering attending 
the introduction of new processes is greatly miti- 
gated by prompt and united action. The societies 
have not succeeded in securing continuity of employ- 
ment, but they have made headway in preventing 
the reserve army of the unemployed from sinking 
all gains by requiring a certain number of hours of 
work for all who are engaged. 

Those who approve the individualistic decisions 
of Illinois courts in relation to restricting the hours 
of work by adult women should consider the history 
of that subject in England (pp. 584-585). We 
seem to be still in a very crude and backward state 
as compared with England since 1847. 

The economists are far more favorable to trade- 
unions than formerly. The former wage fund 
and population theories have suffered great modifi- 
cation in the light of criticism and of life. The 
authors, though pronounced socialists, declare that 
the standard of living has steadily improved among 
capable men. Nominal wages are higher ; the goods 
consumed are cheaper ; hours are shorter ; employ- 
ment is more constant. In this they agree with 
Giffin, Wright, and others who are charged with 
optimism. They see in trade unionism a permanent 
element in a socialistic state, the legal representative 
of the operative members of society. 

The darker side of modern life is seen in the Un- 
employable, a term used to designate the lower grades 
of laborers who cannot earn a full living and merely 
compete enough with capable men to lower their 
wages. Members of this class should be separated 
from others and educated to become employable, or, 
if the defect is too serious, should be kept in farm 
colonies, and made to earn what they can, but with- 
out competing with independent laborers. This con- 
clusion agrees with that of the eminent investigator, 
Mr. Charles Booth. 

It is a little difficult for one closely related to 
another in teaching to be exactly critical, especially 



if he is very proud of his colleague's achievement. 
A brief statement of the topics of Professor Vin- 
cent's " Social Mind and Education" will be enough 
to show that teachers and social students will be 
obliged to make acquaintance with the work for 
themselves. The task of the thesis is to bring to 
bear upon the problem of education certain concep- 
tions of social philosophy. The argument, as summed 
up in the Introduction, follows these subjects : The 
psychical products of social evolution, ideas, judg- 
ments, and desires, react upon individuals and are 
modified by them. Science and philosophy are the 
product of the efforts of the race to join the phe- 
nomena of existence in causal connections and a 
verified system. " Education sets before itself the 
task of relating the individual intrinsically to the 
social tradition, so that he may become an organic 
part of society." The higher education seeks syn- 
thesis of the products of previous analysis. " Social 
life and the student in relation to it form the real 
centre " for correlation of studies. 

There is no social brain or sensorium ; but there 
is social thinking where the members of a group 
share common thoughts and communicate or agree. 
Philosophy as applied to social phenomena aims to 
" afford a view of associated life by generalizing 
into a coherent conception the sciences which have 
been differentiated from the experiences of men, to 
recombine into reality the subjective abstractions of 
the social mind, to serve as a science of the sciences." 

It is in sociology, rather than in physiology, or 
even psychology, according to Dr. W. T. Harris, 
that the various studies are to find their unity and 
full meaning. The present social environment 
man, nature, and the interaction of these is the 
unity which must be first broken up for analysis and 
again integrated in the higher synthesis of an intel- 
lectual system. The various schemes for harmo- 
nizing and giving order to the various studies are 
described. On the basis of this survey a tentative 
curriculum for a college course is laid out with some 
detail of illustration. A very excellent apparatus of 
references, in foot-notes and bibliography, gives 
increased value to an important discussion of a great 
theme. But these quotations are much more than 
mere patches of color ; they are the starting-points 
of independent criticism, and are made to render 
real service in the expansion of the central theme. 
The whole subject of the relation of sociology to 
pedagogy is here brought up to date. 

" Social Transformations of the Victorian Age," 
by Mr. T. H. S. Escott, is a milestone on the high- 
way of progress. It is written in the optimistic 
style of Mr. Carnegie's " Triumphant Democracy." 
With a light and airy motion we are carried over 
thirty-one chapters in the illuminated story of the 
Queen's reign. If one side is given undue promi- 
nence, it certainly is that side which is most agree- 
able to look upon. What so many have won may 
be possible for many others to achieve, and the 
advance-guard tells of a host pressing closely in their

footsteps. Cheerful it is to walk about the mother- 
country with a well-informed citizen, and consider 
the growth of wealth, the enlarged power of the 
democracy, the improved means of education, the 
fusion of classes in local government, the renewed 
spiritual life of the ancient universities, the achieve- 
ments of science and invention, the transfiguration 
of religions thought and practice, and the reign of 
law at home and in the colonies. 

Mr. Wyckoff's interesting articles narrating his 
experiences as a laboring-man have appeared in book 
form, and they are well worth reading or re-reading. 
" An Experiment in Reality " it was for a soft- 
handed scholar to take his chances in lanes, high 
roads, lumber camps, on farms and in ditches, with 
those inured to hard labor. Moneyless, he made 
his way across New York and Pennsylvania, hiring 
out here and there for what he could get for un- 
skilled service. With excellent literary power he 
makes us see and feel with him and his companions, 
and to realize the chasm which divides classes in 
this country. Of course there must be something 
too subjective and partial in this brief trial of a new 
mode of life. The scholar who has not been brought 
up with laborers can never quite take their point of 
view. But this writer at least brings our fellows of 
the ditch and the woods closer to our sympathies. 
The characterization of types is sketchy, but bold 
and strong. If anyone is tempted to draw too hasty 
inferences from these scattered hints of life, and 
generalize on the basis of mere suggestions, it will 
not be the author's fault ; for he is modest in gen- 
eralizations, and puts us on our guard against taking 
a story for a philosophy. c> R _ HENDERSON.

Shakespeare and like Sir Lewis Morris, for ex- 
ample, or to look coldly upon the Venus of Melos 
and warm up at sight of a Rogers group. In other 
words, musical compositions are good or bad without 
any regard for the tastes of the ignorant public, and 
the critic is the one who knows the difference be- 
tween good and bad, and is prepared to advance 
solid scientific reasons for the faith that is in him. 
To help those who know little of music as an art to 
form judgments with some approximation to cor- 
rectness, is the purpose of the book whose keynote 
is sounded at the outset in the words above quoted. 
Mr. Henderson writes in a very plain and reason- 



Mathtmatical

able manner, indulging now and then in a bit of 
satirical comment, and occasionally saying things 
that are not often heard but cannot be said too often. 
One of these things is thus expressed : " Without 
musical emotion that can be communicated to the 
hearer, the most exquisite touch in the world will 
have no effect. Temperament temperament is 
what we all cry for. What is temperament? It is 
hard to define, but easy to discern. We know that 
Jean de Reszke radiates with it, and that Melba is 
absolutely without it." As for the satire, the follow- 
ing is neatly put : " You were once persuaded to go to 
what a friend described as a chamber-music concert. 
There you heard four ghostly persons perform an 
operation which seemed to you to be the articulation 
of a symphonic skeleton. At that entertainment you 
became reckless and slept openly in the sight of all 
men. And let me add in strict confidence that if 
the performance was no better than most of our 
quartet-playing, I do not blame you for your som- 
nolence." We hope that our few words of commend- 
ation will send a good many non-musical readers to 
Mr. Henderson's book. It deserves a large audi- 
ence, and is sure to help those who are struggling 
in the endeavor to appreciate musical art, and need 
to be helped in just this way. 

A volume of a hundred pages with 
so formidable a title as " The Math- 
ematical Psychology of Gratry and 
Boole, translated from the language of the Higher 
Calculus into that of Elementary Geometry by Mary 
Everest Boole " (Putnam) is likely to attract some 
little attention by its title alone. But the mathe- 
matician will probably pass this bizarre little volume 
over to the psychologist, and the psychologist will 
be equally anxious to shift the burden of responsi- 
bility upon the mathematician ; while the curiosity 
of the general reader, unless he happens to enjoy 
something of this flavor, will be satisfied by a very 
small dose. The husband of the translator was 
Professor George Boole, an eminent mathematician, 
and particularly remembered for his original con- 
tributions to the field of symbolic logic as studied by 
algebraic methods. But the present brochure is as 
innocent of any account of Boole's work as it is of 
mathematics or psychology. There is a liberal 
sprinkling of mathematical terms distorted into un- 
usual uses, but no appreciation of the essential prin- 
ciples of mathematical procedure. The task of stat- 
ing what the book is not is comparatively simple ; 
to indicate what it really contains is very difficult, 
for this raises the question on the part of the reader 
as to whether he really knows or understands what 
the book does contain. There is, however, a con- 
siderable use of the argument by analogy, and the 
analogies are very flimsy. Because some figures 
used in the process of multiplication disappear in 
the conclusion, we have the law of sacrifice ; the 
geometric diagonal indicates the principle of com- 
promise ; mathematical thought is inspiration, and 
habit is the multiplication table. Then we have

disquisitions on vivisection and theology, on genius 
and insanity, on education and Newton, on morals 
and religion. These are all disconnectedly strung 
together, and leave one with an uncanny sense of 
puzzlement and incoherence. It is possible that the 
author had some ideas to express, but they are not 
very apparent, and may just as well come under any 
other rubric as under that of Mathematical Psy- 
chology. 

The Blackwood The earl y Edinburgh Reviewers, the 
group of Fraserians, the Blackwood set, are 
famous Scots. interesting groups in a time now tak- 
ing to itself the golden tone of romance. Their inter- 
est is now largely historic, or, more accurately speak- 
ing, largely heroic. The men themselves are better 
remembered than their works : few read Jeffrey or 
Sydney Smith, save perhaps in selections ; the wit 
and learning of Maginn and Mahoney has preserved 
their writings for a few only ; and we think of the 
heroes of the " Noctes " more as characters in lit- 
erature than as creators of it. A new volume of 
the " Famous Scots Series " (Scribner) is written by 
Sir George Douglas, on " The Blackwood Group." 
It contains sketches, necessarily short, of John Wil- 
son, John Gait, D. M. Moir, Miss Ferrier, Michael 
Scott, and Thomas Hamilton. Lockhart and Hogg 
would of course have been included, were not sepa- 
rate volumes of the series reserved for them. This 
is right ; but still, Christopher North seems a little 
lonely without Timothy Tickler and the Ettrick 
Shepherd. Of the six authors in question, we incline 
to think that the only one now read is Michael Scott. 
The enormous production of Wilson, the facile work 
of " Delta," the varied extemporizations of John 
Gait, are now nowhere ; but " Tom Cringle's Log " 
may be said still to exist. As to Miss Ferrier's 
" Marriage," we own to doubts. Sir George Douglas 
has immense admiration for it and its companions, 
and speaks of them in very strong terms. Indeed, 
he rather makes one wish to read many a book 
which we feel sure nobody otherwise would read. 
This we may or may not do ; at any rate, we have 
here an excellent book for a niche in literary history 
that was vacant. 

It was once a matter of vexation to 
Macaulay that he could not under- 
stand Kant's " Critique." It seemed 
to him that a man who could understand Plato, 
Aristotle, Bacon, Locke, ought to be able to under- 
stand the work of a German professor translated by 
a Liverpool merchant. Macaulay was inclined to 
think that the fault lay with Kant ; but here he was 
partly wrong. In manner something like, are we a 
little vexed that we have not wholly mastered the 
story of " The Statue in the Air " by Caroline Eaton 
Le Conte (Macmillan). We followed, in our time, 
the adventures of Endymion ; we got safely to the 
end of " The Revolt of Islam "; we thought once 
that we had our hand on Zanoni, but here we have 
been baffled. We mention the matter more in re- 
gret than in criticism : an intelligible plot is not the

one thing needful for a tale ; " The Statue in the 
Air " has doubtless a significance beyond the details 
of the story. Still, it may be remarked that even 
though wholly possessed by her glorious theme, the 
author would not have done ill in exhibiting a cer- 
tain consequence and coherence in the events which 
she chronicles. It will be admitted, we think, that 
the general reader likes to see some connection be- 
tween what he is reading at any time and what he 
has already read. The book presents in myth-like 
phantasietta the doings in some apocryphal pseudo- 
Hellenic fairy-land. It is a tale of shepherds and 
prophets, of hollow echoes and flushing apple- 
blossoms, of gods and harpies. It hymns in pulsing 
obscurities the awful power of Troglodytes and his 
final destruction by Euphorion, whereby (in our 
opinion) is very mystically shadowed forth the ulti- 
mate victory over Evil of Love through Art. Eupho- 
rian in the first ecstacy of his passion for Leanira 
strikes on a harp a few pellucid chords. " As though 
the music wrought like an invisible chisel . . . out 
of the cold air was created a marble child." The 
sacred statue was enshrined in the Cave of Love ; 
but those curious to know the manner, or the reason, 
or what it had to do with Troglodytes, will do well 
to study the original text, where they may not only 
find what they want to know (a thing always pleas- 
ant), but also enjoy a number of verbal felicities and 
infelicities which we cannot here set down in detail. 



Mysteries of 
the Neo-Celtic 
Movement. 



Mr. W. B. Yeats is already known as 
the author of poems and stories, and 
also as one of the foremost represent- 
atives of that Neo-Celtic Movement which is now 
sometimes mentioned with bated breath. Mr. Yeats 
is the leader of the Erse division of the Gadhelic 
branch of the Neo-Celtic Movement. The Gadhels 
are nowadays a good deal more active than the 
Cymric Neo-Celts ; in fact, Cymric Neo-Celticism is 
now such an old story that there is hardly any Neo- 
ness about it. It need hardly be said that Neo- 
Celticism has no connection at all with the Scotch and 
Irish story-tellers that one sometimes hears of at the 
present day. Mr. Barrie, Mr. Crockett, " Ian Mac- 
laren," are not Neo-Celtic, in fact, they are not 
even Celtic. Miss Jane Barlow is Celtic but not 
Neo-Celtic. Miss Fiona Macleod, however, is Neo- 
Celtic, has even been hailed as the " initiator " of 
the movement ; Miss Nora Hopper is also Neo- 
Celtic, although strangely intelligible. Mr. William 
Sharp is Neo-Celtic in temper though not in topic, 
and Mrs. Sharp has done great service to the move- 
ment by her " Lyra Celtica." But Mr. Yeats is 
the arch Neo-Celticist, and in his last book, " The 
Secret Rose " (Dodd), he shows forth the tenets of 
the cult as clearly as any tenets can be shown forth 
which have ever come into contact with the doc- 
trines of the Rosy Cross. Rosicrucianism is to the 
uninitiated wholly incomprehensible ; and Neo- 
Celticism, except for externals, is very nearly so. But 
if the reader will dismiss from mind any thought 
of subtle doctrine or tenet, he may find in these tales

a good deal of pleasure. One can easily take them 
simply as they come, without knowing or trying to 
know what they may really be about ; and we think 
that in this way one will enjoy them most. As for 
any pseudo-serious ideas shadowed forth in these 
stories, we allow ourselves the opinion that they are 
silly. They may come from the Druids, or from 
the Bound Towers, or from anywhere else ; but if 
no more valuable thoughts are hidden in the Speckled 
Book or the Book of the Dun Cow, we shall be con- 
tent if those massive tomes remain unprinted for 
another thousand years. Paying, therefore, no atten- 
tion to the doctrines of Neo-Celticism, we find in this 
collection of stories not infrequently very great 
charm. From the archaic legend of Aodh and the 
Queen Dectira, through the curious ancient-modern 
tales of Hanrahan the Red to the very contempo- 
rary " Rosa Alchemica," we are constantly coming 
across very charming things, usually bits of descrip- 
tion, which really arouse the imagination. The book 
is by a poet rather than a story-teller, and yet its 
stories are better than the two or three poems that 
it contains a paradox which will say much to any- 
one who fully understands it. 

The second series of the "American 
Lectures on the History of Religions" 
hag ^ been pa bli 8 hed (Putnam). 
These courses of lectures are patterned somewhat 
after the Hibbert Lectures in England, and are pre- 
sented annually at certain Eastern cities Boston, 
New York, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, etc. A well- 
known group of scholars is behind the enterprise, 
which appears destined to be successful. Mr. T. W. 
Rhys-Davids gave the first course, which dealt with 
Buddhism. The second course, given last season, 
was by Dr. Daniel 6. Brinton upon the general 
topic " Religions of Primitive Peoples." The courses 
for 1898 and 1899 are already arranged ; they will 
deal with the religious history of Israel, and are to 
be presented by Dr. Cheyne and Professor Bndde. 
Dr. Brinton is no novice in the field of primitive 
religions. His previous studies, confined chiefly to 
the American field, have been important. In this 
course of lectures he has touched a more general 
theme and drawn material from the whole world. 
He begins by outlining methods and defining terms ; 
then passes to the origin and content of primitive 
religions. Three forms of religious expression are 
recognized the word, the object, the rite. Each 
is examined in detail. In his final lecture the author 
investigates the influence of their religions upon the 
lower peoples and the possible development of such 
religions. Every student, even if he may not agree 
completely with the author, will be glad of this con- 
venient and proper presentation of this subject. As 
the words " primitive peoples " occur in the title of 
the book, it is a pity Dr. Brinton did not more nearly 
confine his discussions to the conceptions of the most 
primitive peoples known. Certainly the Aztecs and 
the Vedie Aryans are far from primitive, both in 
life and belief. One of the strongest of the many 



good points of the book is the constant analysis of 
subjects. The separation of primary elements and 
their clear definition is certainly most important. 



matrimonial 



consequence of the 
pretty volume entitled " The Love 
Affairs of Some Famous Men" 
(Stokes) is fairly indicated by its catchy title. The 
author, or rather compiler, presents a long list of 
famous authors, painters, musicians, divines, law- 
yers, statesmen, and so on, and shows us in a chatty 
anecdotal way how they " got on " with their wives 
and mistresses which was, it is needless to say, in 
many cases very badly. There was John Wesley, 
for instance, who married a Mrs. Vizelle, a widow 
whose subsequent conduct went far to bear out the 
theory of the elder Weller. It is credibly related 
that Mrs. Wesley was even given to beating her 
eloquent husband. John Hampson, one of Wesley's 
preachers, we learn, " told his son that he once went 
into a room in the north of Ireland where he found 
Mrs. Wesley foaming with rage. Her husband was 
on the floor. She had been dragging him about 
by his hair, and still held in her hand some of the 
locks that she had pulled out of his head. More 
than once she laid violent hands upon him, and tore 
those venerable locks which had suffered sufficiently 
from the ravages of Time." No wonder a man so 
afflicted could hold the view of things embodied in 
his expressive lines, 

" A point of life, a moment's space, 
Removes me to that heavenly place, 
Or shuts me up in hell." 

The volume is pleasantly written, and the author 
has ranged over a wide field in gathering his ex- 
amples. _ 

Some years ago, Professor A. S. Cook, 
of Yale Diversity, published an en- 
tertaining little book on " The Bible 
and English Prose Style," in which he says that 
' from Caedmon's time to the present the influence 
of Bible diction upon English speech has been vir- 
tually uninterrupted." In his latest and more im- 
portant work, " Biblical Quotations in Old English 
Prose Writers" (Macmillan), beginning with the 
well-known Hymn of Caedmon, Professor Cook pre- 
sents an admirable conspectus of old English bib- 
lical versions from the seventh to the tenth century, 
embodying a summary of the best critical results of 
modern scholarship. The biblical scholar interested 
in the history of English versions, as well as the 
professional student of English, will hardly find else- 
where a more accurate survey of the field than ia 
here presented. The body of the book is taken up 
with extracts containing biblical quotations, from 
King Alfred's Version of Gregory's Pastoral Care 
(60 pp. ), the Laws of King Alfred (8 pp.), King 
Alfred's Version of Bede's Ecclesiastical History 
(6 pp.)' an d Aelfric's Homilies (182 pp.), all with 
the Latin originals printed at the foot of the page. 
Of these the most interesting, perhaps, are the ex- 
tracts from the Laws of the good king, closing with

the quotation : " And thaet ge willen thaet othre men

forces the reflection that, after a thousand years, we 
are not yet near the Golden Age. To one familiar 
with Latin, the acquisition of a reading knowledge 
of Anglo-Saxon could not be made easier. The 
book contains two complete indexes on " Biblical 
Passages " and on " Principal Words."

lent monograph by Mr. otephen 
Paget (Putnam). Pare*, though wholly devoted to 
bis profession, lived in the midst of such stirring 
events that his personality and his position at court 
are often used by writers in presenting a picture of 
the times. Thus, Balzac, in " Catherine de Medici," 
makes Pare* the central figure in a dramatic story of 
the death of Francis II., an incident merely referred 
to by the present author with the statement that the 
surgeon was accused by rivals of using means to 
prevent the recovery of his patient. That Pare* was 
a keen observer is shown by quotations from his 
" Journeys in Diverse Places," and these, with a 
chapter of explanatory notes, furnish the most inter- 
esting reading in the present work. His ability in 
surgery, says the author, lay not so much in the 
invention of new methods as in the improvement of 
old ones. The vexed question of Park's religion is 
decided in favor of Catholicism, although his hu- 
manitarian sentiments made him openly disapprove 
of the civil wars and gave opportunity to his ene- 
mies to charge him with being in secret a Huguenot. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Professor Henry P. Johnston, of the College of the 
City of New York, has made an exhaustive study of a 
local engagement of the Revolutionary War. True, it 
was a minor engagement, and yet one which for the 
first time gave some confidence to the crude Continen- 
tal soldier, because he saw there a retreating red-coat. 
The result of the study has been admirably given to the 
public, with many maps and present-day photographs, 
in a monograph entitled "The Battle of Harlem 
Heights " (Macmillan). 

" Natural Magic," being Book I. of the three to which 
the " Occult Philosophy or Magic " of Henry Cornelius 
Agrippa extends, translated into English, and edited by 
Mr. Willis F. Whitehead, is published by Messrs. Hahn 
& Whitehead, Chicago. We can only say of such pub- 
lications that for those who like this sort of thing the 
present volume is undoubtedly the sort of thing they will 
like. The observation is trite, but one can hardly be 
expected to take seriously, except for their relation to 
the history of human thought, the works of Cornelius 
Agrippa or any other writers of his general type. 

" The Wild Flowers of California," by Miss Mary 
Elizabeth Parsons, is published at San Francisco by Mr. 
William Doxey, and is one of the most creditable books, 
to both author and publisher, that have ever come to 
us from the Pacific slope. Its method is essentially that 



employed by Mrs. William Starr Dana in her " How to 
Know the Wild Flowers," although the present volume 
is the more comprehensive of the two. In other words, 
Mrs. Dana makes a judicious selection of species for 
description, whereas Miss Parsons gives us a flora, prac- 
tically complete for practical purposes, of the region 
which includes California, Oregon, and Washington. 
The plates are accurately and artistically drawn from 
the plants described, and there are over two hundred of 
them. 

Mr. W. M. Griswold, whose annotated lists of books 
are so useful to librarians and readers in general, has 
sent us a catalogue of " The Novels of 1897." There 
are two arrangements, under authors and subjects, with 
references to selected critical reviews. Sometimes the 
review in question is boiled down into one expressive 
epithet, as in the following entry: "Annunzio, G: d', 
' Triumph of Death,' Rich.: loathsome, D., 11." Mr. 
Griswold's pamphlets offer, with their scientific classi- 
fication and absolute accuracy, an excellent illustration 
of how this sort of thing ought to be done. The present 
pamphlet also shows how it ought not to be done, by re- 
printing the " Library Journal's " review, severe but not 
unjustifiably so, of a recent bibliography of prose fiction 
which made a most amazing display of inaccuracy and 
slovenly workmanship.

Hayes of Boston. The collection is an interesting and

" L'Echo de la Semaine," Boston, has begun the pub- 
lication of a series of selected short French stories for 
students and schools, with English notes by Professor 
Alphonse N. Van Daell of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. Two volumes, " Six Jolis Contes " and 
Bourget's " Antigone " are ready. The volumes will be 
twenty-five cents each. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the American agents 
for Dr. T. E. Thorpe's " Manual of Inorganic Chemis- 
try," of which a new edition, in two volumes, has just 
been published. Part II. of " The Tutorial Chemistry," 
by Mr. G. H. Bailey and Mr. William Briggs, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Hinds & Noble. This work is devoted 
to the chemistry of the metals. 

One of the best of the many " newspaper catalogues " 
which are issued annually by the leading advertising

We have received from Mr. S. Burns Weston, of 
Philadelphia, the American agent for the publication, 
several early numbers of a new English weekly called 
" The Ethical World." Mr. Stanton Coit, long asso- 
ciated with Dr. Adler in the ethical movement in New 
York, is the editor of this paper, which offers an attrac- 
tive list of contents, by no means as narrowed in theme 
as one might at first suppose. It is true that ethical 



ideas underlie all of the contributions, but they range 
for all that over a fairly wide field of politics, sociology, 
and literature, and provide reading at once thoughtful 
and interesting. Each number of the paper has sixteen 
pages of "Spectator" size. The enterprise deserves 
hearty encouragement, and we are glad of the oppor- 
tunity to say these few words in its behalf. 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have now ready for 
publication the first of the four volumes to which their 
new " Dictionary of the Bible " will extend. The num- 
ber of articles will be about fifteen thousand, mostly 
signed, and the work will be sold only by subscription. 
Dr. James Hastings is the editor in chief, and has had 
much competent assistance and expert collaboration. 

An "American Explorers " series, edited by Dr. Elliott 
Coues, is announced by Mr. Francis P. Harper. The 
initial volume will be a journal of Major Jacob Fowler's 
travels to the Rocky Mountains in 1821-22, and the 
second will be " Forty Years a Fnr Trader on the Upper 
Missouri," by Charles Larpenteur. Both these works 
are to be printed from manuscripts hitherto unpublished. 

Volume XLIII. of " The Sacred Books of the East," 
edited by Professor F. Max Miiller, is devoted to 
Part IV. of Mr. Julius Eggeling's translation of The 
Satapatha-Brahmana." Volume XL VII. in the same 
series is a continuation of Mr. E. W. West's translation 
of selected " Pahlavi Texts." These works, as we hardly 
need to add, are published by the Oxford Clarendon 
Press. 

The 1898 volume of that useful compendium, " Haz- 
ell's Annual," being the thirteenth annual volume, is 
imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The num- 
ber of new articles included is, as usual, considerable, 
among them being the Behring Sea Question, the Re- 
public of Central America, Local Taxation, Foreign 
Navies, and biographies of Messrs. John Hay and Gil- 
bert Parker. 

" A History of the English Poor Law," by the late 
Sir George Nicholls, was first published in 1860, and has 
long been the standard authority upon its subject. A 
new edition of the work is now put forth by Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons, in two stout volumes, edited by Mr. 
H. G. Willink, who has supplied an extended biography 
of the author, besides incorporating with the text the 
many revisions made before his death. 

Messrs. Patrick Geddes & Colleagues of Edinburgh 
are the publishers of a neat paper-covered set of the 
shorter stories of Miss Fiona Macleod. There are three 
volumes, in a box, and they are respectively entitled 
" Spiritual Tales," " Barbaric Tales," and " Tragic Ro- 
mances." The volume of Miss Macleod's work is now 
considerable, comprising, as it does, six other volumes 
in addition to these collections of short pieces.

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



well as to receptions that will be given them, will he 
regulated by the local committee under the presidency 
of M. Asser, Counsellor of State. Mr. James Gustavus 
Whiteley (223 West Lanvale street, Baltimore, Md.), 
of the Society of Diplomatic History of Paris, has been 
appointed to organize, and to preside over, the section 
of the United States. 

That sprightly illustrated magazine, " The Land of 
Sunshine," published at Los Angeles, announces in its 
April issue some interesting plans by which it is to be 
made still more distinctively " the magazine of Califor- 
nia and the West." Its capable and aggressive editor, 
Mr. Charles F. Lummis, himself an entertaining and 
authoritative writer, has rallied to its support many well- 
known Western writers, or writers on Western subjects, 
among them Mrs. Mary Hallock Foote, Mrs. Margaret 
Graham Collier, and others. The magazine is to be 
stronger than ever in " local color," but it is to be the 
color of the West rather than of California only. In 
Mich a scheme it is much to know that the colors are 
real, and applied by skilful hands; and this we may 
count on, under Mr. Lummis's management. It would 
seem that the magazine has a field all its own, and is 
likely to fill it successfully and well.

THE SINGER 

Automatic Chain - stitch 
Sewing=Machine. 
Highest type for all purposes in which a 

chain-stitch can be used. Owing to the simple

of remarkable durability and efficiency. 

Especially distinguished for compactness, absolute 
noiselessness, and light-running qualities. 

Adapted to a wide range of work, upon almost any 
variety of fabric. Its capacity under the arm is greater 
than that of any similar machine.

SCRIBNER'S NEWEST BOOKS 



First Edition of 10,000 Copies Now Ready. 

THE QIRL AT COBHURST. By Frank R. Stockton. 

12mo, $1.50. 

A N entirely new love-story which contains some of Mr. Stockton's best humorous work. The scene is laid 
** in one of the little country villages he knows so intimately, and the characters all bear the stamp of his 
inimitable genius. The development of the plot is strikingly ingenious, even for such a past-master in these 
intricacies as the author has for years shown himself to be. 

" I have been reading him now " His name alone carries a laugh 

a good many years with an increas- with it. " The, Dial. 

ing pleasure which his constant "There is no more thoroughly 

public seems to share, and I am entertaining writer before the 

certain that our literature does not public to-day than Mr. Stockton, 

know a more original or origina- He writes to amuse, and he suc- 

tive spirit." W. D. Howells. ceeds admirably. "Boston Globe. 

By the Author of " A Girl in the Karpathians." 
THE CROOK OF THE BOUGH. 

By MENIE MURIEL DOWIB. 12mo, $1.25. 
Mrs. Henry Norman, who is the author of that extremely breezy 
and original book, " A Girl in the Karpathians," has chosen a partic- 
ularly happy title for her new story. The scene shifts from London 
to Constantinople, in both of which localities the author is much at 
home. The heroine is an English girl of the thoroughly modern and 
advanced type, and the change in her character wrought by her interest 
in the handsome young Turkish Colonel who is the hero (and who, by 
the way, is drawn from life) is a development quite new in fiction, and 
one that is likely to appeal especially to the women of the present day. 



"His unique stories always hit 
the mark." Century. 

" Mr. Stockton has touched the 
high-water mark of romantic fic- 
tion and has shown his power to 
grasp the magic of Defoe and Stev- 
enson." The Speaker. 



" Mr. Frank R. Stockton's gift 
is one of the most characteristic 
which has yet appeared in our lit- 
erature. The fact that it is hu- 
morous and light must not make 
us oblivious of its original qual- 
ity." The Outlook. 



NOW BEING PUBLISHED: 

A NEW EDITION OF THE WORKS OF 
GEORGE MEREDITH. 

Containing the author's final revision of his work. To be in 16 volumes,

Also a limited edition of 20 >4 copies on hand-made paper, the illustrations being printed 
on Japan paper, and with a four-page facsimile manuscript in colors each, $^.00 net. 

""THE well-known actor has here given an entertaining and valuable account of Eugene Field, whose intimate 
* friend he was for many years. His picture of the humorous side of Mr. Field's nature is reinforced by 
anecdotes which display the love of fun that was so characteristic of the man; and Mr. Wilson pays much 
attention also to the deep and enduring love of books, an affection both literary and bibliographical, which 
is a prominent feature in most of the poet's work. His many admirers will surely welcome this attractive 
portrayal of the real Eugene Field. 



ARS ET VITA. 

By T. R. SULLIVAN, author of "Day and Night Stories," 

etc. Illustrated by ALBERT E. STERNER. 12mo, $1.25. 

Mr. Sullivan's collections do not come very often, and are always 

welcome ; for he is one of the most versatile of our fiction writers, 

"and," as the Nation says, "his tales are always perfectly written."

By ANNE DOUGLAS SEDGWICK. 12mo, $1.25.

much of the peculiar atmosphere which surrounds the literary and

THE UNQUIET SEX. 

By HELEN WATTERSON MOODY. 12mo, $1.25. 

Mrs. Moody's clever essays have been pronounced by Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale and other eminent critics to be the sanest and wittiest 
contributions yet made to the " woman question."

Two volumes ready : French I., containing stories by Daudet, 
France, About, Bourget, De Maupassant, Sardou ; and French II.,

" One of the best Revolutionary novels yet written." PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER. 

FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY. By Cyrus Townsend Brady, 

Archdeacon of Pennsylvania, Graduate of U. S. Naval Academy. 
A STORY OF LAND AND SEA IN THE DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION. 

12mo, $1.25. 

JV/IR. BRADY'S spirited patriotic novel has already gone into a third edition, though published only two 
months ago. The following selections from widely different periodicals show something of the critical 
approval which has been given it. 



" A vigorous specimen of Amer- 
ican historical fiction. ... It is 
first of all a patriotic story, and 
the patriotism is not of the blus- 
tering sort, but is founded on high 
ideals of character and conduct 
in public and private life." 
"Droch" in Life. 



" He has a rare dramatic faculty 
which enables him to make his 
figures move like living men and 
women. He has also a rare gift 
of imaginative vision . . . ; and 
then, he is a born story-teller." 
Church Standard. 



"The sea fights are portrayed 
with a graphic power well-nigh 
unexampled in American fiction, 
while the new view of Washington 
in the Trenton and Princeton cam- 
paign gives the book historical 
importance." Army and Navy 
Journal. 



" A distinct addition to Revolu- 
tionary literature, and far ahead 
of any of the stories on the same 
theme which have appeared of late 
years." The Evening World. 

" There are some very thrilling 
chapters of naval warfare in this 
book " Review of Reviews.

Famous Women 
of History 

A complete Cyclopaedia of Female 
Biography, by WILLIAM HARDCASTLE 
BROWNE, A. M., author of Bible Heroes, 
Heart Throbs of Gifted Authors, Witty 
Sayings by Witty People, and other 
popular works. Containing 3000 bio- 
graphical sketches and 1000 pseudonyms 
of women whose names are famous. 

Several years ago, in response to a letter of inquiry 
addressed to the late Samuel Austin Allibone, LL. D., 
that eminent scholar and bibliographer wrote to Mr. 
Browne that no cyclopaedia exclusively of female 
biography had ever been published in this country, to 
his knowledge, and intimated that such a work was 
needed. Mr. Browne immediately set to work, and 
the result of his labors and investigations appears in 
the pages of Famous Women of History. 

I2mo, cloth, 400 pp., $2.00 

A Few Words on 
Robert Browning 

By LEON H. VINCENT. Second edition, 
revised. 

The purpose of this little volume is to emphasize 
the old-fashioned doctrine that poetry makes for 
pleasure and for inspiration; that it does not exist 
chiefly, or even in the least degree, to furnish an arena 
for exhibitions of the intellectual gymnastics of critics. 
The chapter entitled " How not to read Browning," 
protests against that sort of exposition which frightens 
plain readers away, by elevating the study of his works 
into the region of a special science. 

This edition has been thoroughly revised by the 
author, and we bespeak for it the same success as 
marked its introduction. It is set in clear type, and 
printed on fine laid paper, broad margins, uncut edges. 

i6mo, handsomely bound in cloth, gilt 
stamped, uncut edges, 50 cents.

ME. CROCKETT'S NEW ROMANCE. 

The Standard Bearer. 

An Historical Novel. By S. R. CROCKETT, Author of 
"The Lilac Sunbonnet," " Cleg-Kelly," "Lad's Love," 
Bog-Myrtle and Peat," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Crockett stands on ground that he haa made his own in this 
romance of the Scottish Covenanters. The story opens in 1685, " the 
Terrible Tear," with a vivid picture of the pursuit of fugitive Cove- 
nanters by the dragoons. The hero, who becomes a Covenanting min- 
ister, sees many strange and stirring adventures. The charming love 
story which runs through the book is varied by much excellent fighting 
and many picturesque incidents. " The Standard Bearer " is likely to 
be ranked by readers with Mr. Crockett's most successful work. 

Outlines of the Earth's History. 

By Prof. N. S. SHALER, of Harvard University. Illus- 
trated. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

Professor Shaler's comprehensive knowledge and graphic style have 
imparted to his book a peculiar distinction. In its wide range of inform- 
ation and the ludicity with which the various themes are treated, the 
book possesses a value which will be appreciated by many readers and 
by students. 

Italian Literature. 

By RICHARD GARNETT, C.B., LL.D. A new volume in 
the " Literatures of the World Series," edited by 
EDMUND GOSSE. 12 mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Dr. Garnett's abundant scholarship and power of discrimination hare 
furnished an admirable equipment for the preparation of this needed 
work. In traversing the broad field of Italian literature he has not con- 
fined himself to a few masterpieces, but, without burdening his story 
with details, he indicates characteristic phases and significant move- 
ments, which are happily illustrated. His work is clear, interesting, 
and informing. 

A French Volunteer of the War of 
Independence. 

By the Chevalier DE PONTGIBAUD. Translated and 

edited by ROBERT B. DOUGLAS. With Introduction 

and Frontispiece. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This entertaining book is a distinct addition to the personal side of 

Revolutionary literature, and it is peculiarly valuable because of its 

presentation of American life and of the fathers of the Republic as seen 

by a French visitor. The hero's stormy youth and his adventurous and 

varied career give his reminiscences an intimate interest rarely to be 

found in historical fiction, while their historical value is obvious. His 

recollections include his association with Washington, Hamilton, Burr, 

and other conspicuous figures. 

Studies of Good and Evil. 

By Prof. JOSIAH ROYCE, of Harvard University. 12mo, 

cloth, $1.50. 

The unity of this interesting and important book is derived from the 
author's application of his theories of philosophic idealism to relatively 
practical pioblems. He shows bow his philosophical theory may be 
applied to the study of various issues relating to good and evil. The 
' ' problem of evil " as illustrated in Job, the case of John Bunyan, " Ten- 
nyson and Pessimism," together with various suggestive and illuminat- 
ing studies of self-consciousness, and some discussions of special issues, 
among which is the "Squatter Riot of 1850 in Sacramento," are among 
the themes which are treated in a way that illustrates the intimate rela- 
tion of every fragment with the whole in the universe as idealism con- 
ceives it. The original thought and acute observation of the author find 
most striking phases of expression. 



GILBERT PARKER'S NOVELS. 

NEW UNIFORM EDITION.

wards of Amherst's Regiment. By GILBERT PARKER, 
author of " Pierre and his People," " The Trail of the 
Sword," " The Trespasser," etc. Illustrated. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.50. 

" One of the strongest stories of historical interest and adventure 
that we have read for many a day. . . . Through all Mr. Parker moves 
with an assured step, whilst in his treatment of his subject there is a 
happy blending of the poetical with the prosaic, which has characterized 
all his writings. A notable and successful book." London Speaker. 

The Trail of the Sword. 

By GILBERT PARKER, author of " The Trespasser," 
" The Translation of a Savage," etc. Illustrated. 
12mo, cloth, $1.25. 

" The story has the same richness of color and swiftness of move- 
ment, the style the same racy vigor, conciseness, directness, which have 
from the first characterized this admirable artist." Boston Traveller. 

The Translation of a Savage. 

By GILBERT PARKER, author of " The Seats of the 
Mighty," "The Trail of the Sword," "The Tres- 
passer," etc. New uniform edition, enlarged. 12mo, 
cloth, $1.25. 

" Interest, pith, force, and charm. Mr. Parker's story possesses all 
these qualities. . . . Almost bare of synthetical decoration, his para- 
graphs are stirring because they are real. We read at times as we 
have read the great masters of romance breathlessly." The Critic. 

The Trespasser. 

By GILBERT PARKER, author of " The Translation of a 
Savage," " Pierre and his People," etc. 12mo, cloth, 
$1.00. 

"Gilbert Parker's strength, his keen, fresh vitality, would make any 
story he chose to tell interesting, if not remarkable. It is all the better 
that he commonly chooses to tell the sort of a story which gives his 
mental muscle full swing. Of this sort is 'The Trespasser. 1 The uncon- 
ventionality of the book, its fine, free rhythm, its successful development 
of a daring scheme these things must be admired." Boston Traveller.

touches of observation, which reveal a no common grasp of human 
nature. The book is one of remarkable power and still more remarkable 
promise. " Athenceum.

A NEW THEORY OF BIOGRAPHY. 

Every reader is familiar with Wordsworth's 
statement that in the sonnet " Shakespeare un- 
locked his heart," and with Browning's charac- 
teristic comment : " Did Shakespeare ? If so, 
the less Shakespeare he." The controversy, 
although not narrowed to a simple question of 
Shakespearean interpretation, is older than 
either Wordsworth or Browning, and is likely 
to survive as long as literature itself. Does the 
poet indeed reveal himself in his work, or does 
he, in Olympian majesty, 

" Sit as God holding no form of creed, 
But contemplating all " ? 

It is not surprising that Wordsworth and Brown- 
ing should have answered the question in dif- 
ferent if not opposite ways, for the earlier poet 
was essentially of the introspective type, while 
the later was as essentially dramatic, and the 
subjective aspect of thought was as sure to be 
emphasized by the one as its objective aspect 
by the other. The problem is no doubt an inde- 
terminate one, with something to be said for 
either solution ; but we are inclined to think 
that the dramatic solution has been taken a little 
too much for granted, and that a finer method 
of analysis than critics have been wont to apply 
will disclose personal elements in the most im- 
personal of utterances. If even the style be of 
the man himself, as Buffon once remarked, and 
as most of us are willing to allow, how much 
more should the style and its content taken to- 
gether prove a reflection of the poet's individ- 
uality, and supply an intimate revelation of 
most that is really worth knowing about his life.' 

This question, as far as it relates to the baf- 
fling personality of the greatest of poets, has 
recently been taken up in certain critical quar- 
ters, and reopened for discussion in a way that 
must attract attention. The editor of " The 
Saturday Review " has published a series of 
subtly critical papers upon " The True Shake- 
speare " as he may be found in the deepest and 
most characteristic of the plays, while the col- 
umns of " The Athenaeum " have found room 
for the following strong deliverance : 

" A poet, howsoever artistic, howsoever dramatic the 
form of his work may be, is occupied during his entire 
life in painting his own portrait. And if it were not for 
the intervention of the biographer, the reminiscence

THE DIAL,

writer, or the collector of letters for publication, our 
conception of every poet would be true and vital accord- 
ing to the intelligence with which we read his work. 
This is why, of all English poets, Shakespeare is the 
only one whom we do thoroughly know unless perhaps 
we should except his two great contemporaries, Webster 
and Marlowe. . . We know how Shakespeare confronted 
every circumstance of this mysterious life we know 
how he confronted the universe, seen and unseen we 
know to what degree and in what way he felt every hu- 
man passion. There is no careless letter of his, thank God! 
to give us a wrong impression of him. There is no record 
of his talk at the Mermaid, the Falcon, or the Apollo 
saloon to make readers doubtful whether his printed 
utterances truly represent him. Would that the will had 
been destroyed! then there would have been no talk 
about the ' second-best bed ' and the like insane gabble." 

The authority of Dr. Brandes also supports this 
view, and his recent study of Shakespeare con- 
tains nothing more significant and memorable 
than the passage which thus closes the work : 
" It is the author's opinion that, given the possession 
of forty-five important works by any man, it is entirely 
our own fault if we know nothing whatever about him. 
The poet has incorporated his whole individuality in 
these writings, and there, if we can read aright, we shall 
find him. The William Shakespeare who was born at 
Stratford-on-Avon in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who 
lived and wrote in London during her reign and that of 
James, who ascended into heaven in his comedies and 
descended into hell in his tragedies, and died at the age 
of fifty-two in his native town, rises a wonderful per- 
sonality in grand and distinct outlines, with all the vivid 
colouring of life from the pages of his books, before the 
eyes of all who read them with an open, receptive mind, 
with sanity of judgment and simple susceptibility to the 
power of genius." 

Is there not in these passages more than a 
suggestion of a biographical method more prom- 
ising than that with which we have been con- 
tent hitherto ? In other words, when all has 
been said that may be gleaned from the most 
painstaking search of the records wherein the 
external aspects of a great writer's life are re- 
vealed, do we really come to know him half as 
well as we might learn to know him from a rev- 
erent study of his works ? Who is there that, 
having once felt the glow of spiritual commun- 
ion with a beloved poet, does not become chilled 
when he seeks to supplement this intimate ac- 
quaintance by ferreting out accidents and triv- 
ialities of the poet's everyday life? Do we 
know such a man in the best sense when we 
merely know how he looked, and who were his 
associates, and how he earned his living, and 
what were the circumstances by which his ca- 
reer was shaped ? It may be well enough to 
know these things, but we must guard against 
claiming for them an undue significance. With 
the man of action, such things are all that are 
given us to know, but how much richer is the leg- 



acy left us by the man of thought ! Do we often 
know a man's life, however amply-documented, 
as we know the life of Amiel, for example, and 
do not the works of every great writer un- 
consciously supply us with a " Journal Intime " 
which we may read if we will ? Of what sub- 
ordinate importance becomes " chatter about 
Harriet " when we have the poems of Shelley ? 
And with the essays of Montaigne to reveal to 
us the soul of that worthy Gascon, how little are 
we concerned with the Mayor of Bordeaux ? 

It is occasionally said of a man that the study 
of his life shows him to have been greater than 
his works. This is sometimes true in the lit- 
eral sense, as in the case of Dr. Johnson, whom 
assuredly " The Rambler " and " The Lives of 
the Poets " could not endear to us as he is en- 
deared by the journals of his faithful biographer. 
But this is a quite exceptional case; and then, 
who knows how many other men, now little more 
than historical names, might loom up in our con- 
sciousness as vital and commanding figures had 
there been Boswells to limn them for us ? To the 
fame of a man who is essentially a Maker of lit- 
erature the memory of his other achievements 
can add little, and when we speak of him as 
greater than his work we fall into exaggeration, 
although of a generous and pardonable sort. 
What we are really doing is to give expression to 
our delight in discovering that the high ideals of 
the work have their counterpart in the life, that 
our hero realized his true self in his lesser activi- 
ties as well as in those greater activities by which 
he has earned remembrance. This sort of con- 
sonance is indeed rare, and when we discern it 
in the life of a Dante or a Milton, our reverence 
is deepened, and our admiration echoes the sen- 
timent of Rossetti when he speaks of Dante's 
proud refusal to accept a degrading amnesty. 

" Such were his words. It is indeed 
For ever well our singers should 
Utter good words and know them good 
Not through song only ; with close heed 
Lest, having spent for the work's sake 
Six days, the man be left to make." 

But the imperfection of nature is such that the 
man is often " left to make " in some parts of 
his composite individuality ; what we would 
now urge is that every man is entitled to be 
judged by his strength rather than by his weak- 
ness, and that the biographer of a great writer 
needs to remain ever on his guard lest the 
splendid services of his subject be dimmed or 
obscured by an over-insistence upon matters of 
irrelevant detail. Let us still be curious 
although not too curious concerning the ex- 
ternal history of the creators of literature ; but 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

let us also hold fast to the fact that the truest 
record of their lives is to be found in the books 
they have left us, that a formal biography can 
at best do nothing more than cast side-lights 
upon a poet's personality, that a display of the 
trappings and the suits of life is but a poor 
substitute for the direct self-revelation offered 
by the work itself. 



THE GREATEST LITERARY FORM. 

It is worth while to repeat, with Aristotle and 
Lessing, that tragedy is the top achievement of the 
human intellect. Of course this is not an universal 
opinion. The Greeks in general seem to have re- 
garded Homer as the norm of literature, and Proclus 
describes the tragic poets as wandering in intoxi- 
cated error from his true path. And Keats says 
that " The epic is of all the king, round, vast, and 
spanning all like Saturn's ring." But these are 
enthusiasms. Most critics have agreed with Aristotle, 
that tragedy contains all that the epic does, in a 
more concentrated form, and a great deal besides. 
Perhaps the inevitable dualism of life the Me and 
Not-Me comes out more definitely in the dialogue 
of tragedy than in any other form of literature. It 
is remarkable that whereas all the great epic poets 
have been believers, have accepted the religion or 
creed of their times and justified the ways of God 
to man, the greater dramatists, on the other hand, 
have all given a skeptical or doubtful solution of 
the problem of existence. Homer, Virgil, Dante, 
Milton, Tasso the list is one of unquestioning wor- 
shippers. The Author of the Book of Job, -^Eschylus, 
Shakespeare, Goethe, Moliere, this is just as 
surely a roll-call of doubters or deniers. Even 
Calderon, the poet of Catholicism, in his two greatest 
plays, forgets his faith in the Cross and the Inqui- 
sition, and gives us the inexplicable struggle of 
thought. A practical explanation of this division of 
roles between the two orders of poets lies in the fact 
that the epic poet deals with the outward world 
with bodies and things. Gods, goddesses, angels, 
and demons, with their respective heavens and hells, 
are a lucky find for him an extension of his do- 
main. But tragedy deals with the human soul 
which is incapable of extension, only capable of 
division. It does not follow that epic poetry is the 
most religious or the most profound. It only shows 
God acting on the world directly ; but tragedy shows 
him as acting through His enemy His laws re- 
vealed by the very opposition to them. 

Aristotle's dictum that tragedy, through fear and 
pity, effects a purification from such like passions, is 
one of his dark sayings that compel conjecture. In 
whom does it effect this purification, and how can 
pity purify from pity? Thomas Taylor, the trans- 
lator of Aristotle, is the only one, so far as I know, 
who decidedly asserts that the purification is not in 



the spectators. He says tragedy purifies from those 
perturbations which happen in the fable and are the 
cause of the unhappy events. This is illuminating 
night with black smoke. He seems to mean, how- 
ever, that the play evolves itself through agitation 
into calm, and conducts the spectator or reader 
through the same operations. Something like this is 
Goethe's view. But most commentators accept the 
usual view that terror and pity act on like passions. 
That such is the case, may be doubted. In Gray's 
phrase, we " may snatch a fearful joy" at times from 
tragedy, but as a rule the spectator does not feel fear 
at all such instances as the women fainting on the 
appearance of the Furies pursuing Orestes being ex- 
ceptional ; nor is pity aroused to such an extent as 
would be required for purification. Indeed, I suspect 
the feeling awakened is more that which Lucretius 
frankly avows when he says that it is pleasant to 
stand safely on a cliff and behold a shipwreck. 

I think the main causes of our pleasure in tragedy 
are two : a feeling of admiration for power as it 
exhibits itself in the unrolling of events, an admira- 
tion like that with which we gaze on great destruc- 
tive exhibitions of natural force such as a thunder- 
storm or a volcano in action ; and, second, the feeling 
of sympathy and kinship for greatly doing or suf- 
fering characters. We feel that we too under like 
circumstances could oppose ourselves to the whole 
power of Fate, and equal it, at least, by defying it. 
Our pleasure in the mere display of power accounts 
for our tolerance of creations of utter wickedness, 
but of supreme intellect, such as Richard, or lago, 
or Mephistopheles ; and our feeling of kinship with 
extreme nobleness or greatness of character, caught 
in the toils of chance or design, explains our love 
for Hamlet and Othello. They give us a better 
opinion of ourselves. Energy triumphant in evil 
appeals to us, and good supreme in defeat gives us 
profound joy. Only weakness, moral or intellectual, 
repels us, and is unfitted for tragic representation. 

Hamlet is not weak in any sense. He does every- 
thing, sooner or later, which could be expected of a 
tragic hero. But his intellect is so vast that it is 
like illimitable space, where there can be no motion, 
because an object can never get farther from the 
centre or nearer to the circumference. In compar- 
ison, Faust is a weak and ignoble creation, bent on 
low aims and always led by the nose. I suppose 
there is no educated man who has not at some time 
imagined himself a Hamlet, but I never heard of 
anyone who wanted to be Faust, in spite of the 
youth, the riches, and the " good fortunes " of the 
German Doctor. The hypocritical pretense of a 
love for humanity, by which he evades just retribu- 
tion in the end, is a piece with the rest of his char- 
acter. Had he paid his debt to the devil like a 
gentleman, as did Marlowe's Faustus and Molie're's 
Don Juan, we might have some respect for him. As 
it is, be is a mere principle of gravitation holding 
together the incoherent atoms of a chaotic poem. 
The work lives by reason of the beauty of its cen- 
tral episode, the profoundly conceived character of

THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



Mephistopheles, and the wit, poetry, and philosophy 
with which it overflows. As a complete work of 
art, it has no claim to rank with the Greek trage- 
dies or with Shakespeare ; and to place it beside the 
Divine Comedy, as some have done, is to equal a 
nebulae with a finished system of stars. 

The heroes of Greek tragedy were personalities ; 
those of Shakespeare are persons. In the Greek 
conception, the abstract idea is predominant ; in 
Shakespeare, the concrete individual. Antigone 
or Electra is universal girlhood placed in certain 
predicaments ; Cordelia and Desdemona are partic- 
ular women. Orestes is the ordinary filial human 
being in a most terrible position ; Hamlet is original, 
and unlike any other mortal. The collision with 
the Greeks is sharper and more definite. It does 
not soften itself with humor or human peculiarities. 
Its effect is more tremendous and instantaneous, but 
not so penetrating. It is a contradiction of abstract 
ideas that must destroy each other. 

The first condition under which we can take 
pleasure in the exhibition of tragic force is that we, 
the spectators, shall be safe from it. It follows that 
the more remote and ideal the presentations are, the 
better. Euripides brought tragedy down to earth, 
and his audiences seem to have felt that they were 
involved in the issues he exhibited that they 
were being sermonized and lectured ; and they dis- 
liked him accordingly. Ibsen, a modern Euripides, 
has done the same thing. We are willing to stand 
at gaze for the shafts of satire and laughter ; but 
tragedy is too serious a business to be brought home 
to our hearths and hearts. In true tragedy, hell 
opens at every footstep, and we can only stand this 
when it is sufficiently removed from us to be harm- 
less. We do not domesticate a tiger, or build our 
houses over an active volcano. Ibsen depicts the 
Furies moving among the trivialities and common- 
places of contemporary life. It is no answer to say 
that this is true, that the Furies do wreathe their 
snakes in town houses and villas. Aristotle's law 
is absolute, that a possible improbability is a better 
subject for tragedy than an improbable fact. Be- 
sides, there is weakness and corruption in every one 
of Ibsen's characters, and there can consequently 
not be any effective collision between them. What 
is the moral of " The Doll's House " ? A fool mar- 
ries an idiot, and they expect perfect happiness. 
Every character in " Hedda Gabler " is bad or 
silly. If they suffer, we say it serves them right 
and we do not care. Gina in " The Wild Duck " is 
Ibsen's one rounded piece of humanity. It is a 
Shakespearean, a Cervantic conception ; and her 
demoniac husband is excellent fooling. But what 
are they doing among tragic issues ? They belong 
to comedy, and the sentimentalism of the other fig- 
ures ruins their vraisemblance. 

The characters of Victor Hugo's drama resemble 
those figures which children cut out of colored paper 
white, red, pink, or black. They are disks with- 
out projection. They have no bodies and no souls 
nothing but attitudes and apparel in abundance. 



His dramas are probably his poorest works, because 
they do not contain any of those children or very 
young people whom he did understand intuitively, 
and did not have to piece together out of theory. 

In spite of literary limitations, I am inclined to 
think that Wagner will finally come to stand as the 
greatest tragic poet of modern times. He seized on 
a few great myths with a content of mighty virtues 
and vices, and a consequent struggle which must 
always shake the human soul. The life he depicts 
is truth, while Ibsen's life is merely fact, and Hugo's 
the phantasies of delirium tremens. 

English tragedy has not done itself proud in the 
last century. In spite of Shelley's hazy conception 
of human nature and his failure in objective speech, 
the " Prometheus Unbound " and " The Cenci " are 
the best things it has to show. Byron, with a firmer 
grasp of fact, is far looser in his use of the drama. 
His " Manfred " and " Cain " are the origins of the 
drama of monologue, the parents of a monstrous 
brood Bailey's " Festus," Smith's " Life Drama," 
Ibsen's " Brand," and much of Browning's work. 
In all these, a single figure destroys himself from 
within ; with no adequate collision from without. 
Like all other literary forms, tragedy has fallen into 
hotch-pot in the novel. Hawthorne's " Scarlet Let- 
ter" and E. Bronte's " Wuthering Heights" are 
perhaps its best performances of the new mixture. 
The woman's piece is stern and elemental enough, 
but Hawthorne prettifies and sophisticates a good 
deal. " The Scarlet Letter," a twilight melodrama, 
is hardly universal. All the environment and spe- 
cial pathology of Puritan life must be understood 
before it convinces. Properties and surroundings 
are indeed of small account in real tragedy. Dumas's 
requisites a table, two chairs, two people, and a 
passion are enough for it. The late Robert Louis 
Stevenson had, I apprehend, a genuine tragic gift. 
He understood the transformations of character 
the heights and depths of human nature, its Hima- 
layas by the Indian Seas better than most moderns. 
But he gave himself up to the cultivation of style, 
as the Dutch did to their passion for tulips ; and 
perhaps with the same result. 

Ibsen is to be thanked for one achievement : he 
has compelled the attention of the reading public 
to plays. Why or when the custom of reading plays 
fell into disuse, is hard to state. In the last century 
they were universally read. But I suppose the ease 
of having everything spelled out to the scenery, 
character, incident by the novel, has indisposed the 
average mind for anything that requires intellectual 
effort and alertness. But the literary form which 
projects an action roundly, vividly, instantaneously, 
so that it may show as a whole yet be of polished 
beauty in its details, is too valuable to be lightly 
cast aside. It is absolutely immaterial to a play as 
a piece of literature whether it has been presented 
on the stage or not. The Greek tragedies are no 
longer given, and only a few of Shakespeare's pieces, 
but that does not interfere with our enjoyment of 
them ; and a good play that has never seen the

boards ought to have an equal chance with readers 
with a new novel. It is necessary, of coarse, that 
dramatic work should conform to dramatic condi- 
tions, which for the most part are theatric conditions 
also. An interminable work, for instance, like Tay- 
lor's " Philip van Artevelde," which runs on forever, 
ought not to call itself a play. And Mr. Swinburne's 
dramas err against all dramatic construction and 
human reason, in their long speeches. We can only 
imagine that the characters themselves listen to each 
other by a sort of tacit convention that each one is 
to have his own innings, though some of them, 
indeed, don't even allow this, but carry their bat 
out. Subject, therefore, to reason, the rescue of the 
play, and especially tragedy, as a literary form, is 
the most important art movement that can be under- 
taken. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, April 18, 1898. 

The talk is still of magazines. I understand that one of 
onr younger publishing houses has had placed in its hands 
a very large sum, for the purpose of founding and carry- 
ing on a new illustrated weekly. From what I hear, it 
is to be a " big thing," and likely to make some stir. 
The illustrated literary monthly, of which I have already 
told you, is still in embryo; but, in the meantime, a 
company of literary and artistic gentlemen is busy plan- 
ning a new illustrated monthly magazine, to be devoted 
to the interests of the collector art, books, china, stamps, 
posters, and the rest. Each department is to have its 
special editor, and the magazine as a whole is to be under 
the management of a general director. The illustrations 
are to be a special feature, not merely reproductions, but 
largely of original work by our most accomplished black- 
and-white artists. Mr. Oswald Crawfurd's "London 
Review " is to appear on May 5. From the prospectus 
I find that it is to be " a high-class weekly Review deal- 
ing independently and impartially with Politics, Current 
Affairs, Literature, and the Money Market." Rather 
a handful to poise for one penny. 

The fashion for finely printed and elegantly bound 
library editions of our classic novelists is growing. 
Stevenson, Meredith, Kipling, Lever, Scott, and Jane 
Austen have had their sponsors; we are now to have a 
similar production of the works of the Sisters Bronte. 
The edition is to consist of thirteen handsome large 
crown octavo volumes, and will include, when com- 
pleted, the " Life," by Mrs. Gaskell. The paper on which 
the stories will be printed is to equal that used for the 
best of the modern editions-de-luxe, and the " get up " 
generally will be in the taste to appeal to collectors and 
lovers of fine books. A complete bibliography is to be 
included in the "Life." The publishers are Messrs. 
Downey & Co., and the first two volumes may be ex- 
pected early in September. 

Mr. E. A. Petherick is one of onr most ardent Aus- 
tralasian bibliographers. For many years he has been 
engaged on a bibliography of Australasia and Polynesia, 
until now the manuscript of his work, which was exhib- 
ited at the International Library Conference in July last, 
extends to twenty-six quarto volumes. I understand that, 
since his retirement from business, Mr. Petherick has 
been actively engaged in passing this magnum opus of 
bis through the press, and that it is on the eve of being 
published in an imperial octavo volume of nearly 1000 
pages. 

Publishers are not finding affairs going as smoothly 
as they could wish. The several failures which have 
lately occurred may be followed by some more. In that 
event we may hope for a slackening of the present ten- 
sion. The new Chairman of the Publishers' Association 
is Mr. John Murray, and Mr. Murray is rather keen on 
having a " close season " in publishing. Perhaps he will 
take steps to realize it; although it will be extremely 
difficult for publishers to agree to anything which ham- 
pers their freedom in their business operations. It might 
suit a great many to publish, say, from September to 
April; but there are just as many who favor issuing 
their novels in the holiday season. I fail to see why 
there should be such a " close season." It simply means 
that the publications of twelve months are to be crowded 
into seven; and how, in that event, the publishers can 
expect a proper appreciation of their wares, I cannot 
see. What I conclude from such a course is, that the

competition would become keener, and the weakest 
would go to the wall. In other words, the larger pub- 
lishing houses would benefit in the long run. 

Book sales in our auction rooms are arousing a lively 
interest; while the three months that are to come before 
the season closes will see some fine collections dispersed. 
The final portion of the Ashburnham library, the inter- 
esting antiquarian collection of Mr. E. Walford, the 
books of Mr. A. Morrison, and a few others, will all 
make much talk and good business for the " second-hand 
trade." But what one obtains for a book at an auction 
sale, and the price that a bookseller often asks for it are 
not always the same. A fortnight ago, the collection of 
books and manuscripts of Mr. H. B. Weaver was dis- 
persed by Messrs. Christie & Co. All the lots had been 
already offered for sale by a leading second-hand dealer 
in this city, so that a comparison between the prices 
asked and the prices obtained may easily be made. I 
have been amusing myself lately by making this com- 
parison, and the result is perfectly ludicrous. It may 
amuse you also, if I give a few examples. I remember 
once visiting the premises and looking at a really fine 
series of extra-illustrated books, consisting of Boydell's 
" History of the Thames," Home's " History of Na- 
poleon," and Thiers's " History of the French Revolu- 
tion." The series was truly a remarkable one, and 
amounted to nineteen magnificently bound atlas folio 
volumes, crammed with rare portraits and autographs. 
I have no doubt the set was worth 10,000 the price 
asked for it; I am not in a position to say it was not. 
At the sale, however, the three works were sold sepa- 
rately, with this result : The Boydell fetched 69, 
Home's " Napoleon " 84, and Thiers's " French Revo- 
lution" 115, making a total of 268! The question 
naturally arises which is the truer value, 10,000 or 
268 ? A set of the first four folios of Shakespeare 
was also sold. The price asked by the bookseller was 
somewhere between 2000 and 3000; the prices real- 
ized at the auction sale were 98 for the first, 64 for 
the second, 107 for the third, and 35 for the fourth 
or a total of 304. A copy of the 1544 (Lyons) 
edition of the " Recueil des Histoires de Troye " brought 
24 10s. 600 was the price attached to this. You 
will agree with me that a collector requires to be very 
careful in buying if he intends to make a profit by sell- 
ing his purchases at auction. I have come to the con- 
clusion that the power of a " trade " combination at an 
auction sale is not to be lightly treated and heedlessly 
reckoned with. 

Times are too dull for me to give you another instal- 
ment of prophecies. I must leave that to the many 
" paragraphers " of our many literary news columns. 
Just now, these gentlemen are simply rehashing inform- 
ation already announced. TEMPLE SCOTT. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

THE CLAIMS OF LYRIC POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

With the main contentions of the article " In Regard 
to Poetry," by Mr. Charles Leonard Moore, in THE 
DIAL of April 1, it is impossible not to agree. It is 
hinted, however, that lyric poetry, " the expression of 
the spontaneous, the particular, and the immediate," has 
too little ideality to occupy a high place. " Nothing is 
more certain," it is said further, " than the indifference 



of the public to collections of the little leaves of song." 
The latter assertion is, indeed, too true. But must the 
anthologist be denied even the anticipation of member- 
ship in the choir invisible, resulting from devotion to 
this species of art in a sordid age? Such a view would 
be not a little discouraging to some. 

Fortunately, the last paragraph of the leading article, 
on the opposite page of the same issue, saves much 
search for consolation. We see by the force of great 
examples that the specific and the proximate are some- 
times lost in the flood they unbar. Sometimes? Nay, 
is not the measure of excellence in lyric poetry, as in 
all poetry, the degree of suggestiveness, of generali- 
zation, of applicability, afforded by its particularity and 
immediateness? Examples by the score rush into the 
mind. Soracte standing in deep snow, the blazing sticks 
on the hearth, the harmless fun, have duplicated them- 
selves thousands of times under other forms in the affec- 
tions of the readers of Horace's ode, by virtue of that 
little touch " Leave to the gods the rest " the dogma 
of which, as Schopenhauer would say, is of no moment 
in comparison with its essential proposition, the ineffable 
comfort of the negation of the will, lit so brightly with 
its illustrative background. Heine has told us only the 
most general traits of the child " like a flower," but the 
little poem in which no particular personality is en- 
shrined is intensely, purely lyric, and immortal. The 
essence of tragedy is in " The Twa Corbies," of aspira- 
tion in " Israfel " and the " Ode to the West Wind," of 
eulogy in the sonnet " To Mary Unwin," of the rhythmic 
rising of the sap and stirring of the blood in "Sir Laun- 
celot and Queen Guinevere," of freedom in " To Althsea 
from Prison," of loss in Petrarch's sonnet " Soleasi nel 
mio cor star bella e viva " with its pregnant close 
" Veramente siam noi polvere ed umbra ; 

Veramente la voglia e cieca e 'ngorda ; 

Veramente fallace e la speranza," 

of hard- won deep peace in " Hesperia," of romanticism 
in " Kubla Khan," of homesickness in the " Old Ken- 
tucky Home " and the " Swanee River," of endeavor in 
" Ulysses," of the mystery of youth in " To a Cuckoo "; 
and he would be a hardy critic who would maintain that 
the shortness of any of these prevents it from sinking 
as deeply into the soul as if it had been extended to 
dramatic length. Every recluse may find his apology 
in Mr. Swinburne's sestina " I saw my soul at rest upon 
a day." In this waif, ostensibly from North Carolina, 
"De little chillen's feet so weary, Lord ; 
So weary, so weary, Lord ! 

De little chillen's feet so weary, Lord ! 
Call de little chillen, Lord. 

Come, come, little chillen, come to me," 
who cares whether a creed or a need is implied, whether 
the " chillen " are children or figures of speech, black 
or white, American or Scandinavian? The thought of 
the brief poem which seems to have moved Poe to ex- 
claim, " In perfect sincerity I call and think Alfred 
Tennyson the noblest of all poets," poises itself but for 
a moment in "happy autumn fields"; it is weighted 
with the sum of experience. 

Nor can the apparently local minutiae of descriptive 
lyrics be judged in fitness by any other than this test. 
The elusive but powerful influence of external nature, 
felt in the freshness and wonder of youth, attending the 
vigor of resolve, or the fleeting delight of attainment, 
or the poignancy of loss; always a subtle stay, an unob- 
trusive sympathy, even a mirror of our best selves in 
circumstances which still, it may be, guide our dearest 
motives, or grant the zest of new ones; the entity that 



1898.] 



THE DIAL 



287 



sometimes almost assumes the weight and character of a 
personality, as, when one is listening for trivial sounds, 

" A gentle shock of mild surprise 
Has carried far into his heart the voice 
Of mountain torrents ; or the visible scene 
Would enter unawares into his mind 
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, 
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received 
Into the bosom of the steady lake," 
this presence returns with all its witchery and all its rev- 
elation at the adequate mention of 

" the intense tranquillity 
Of silent hills, and more than silent sky," 
and thus forms at once and definitely a qualification for 
a highest class in objective lyrics, identical with that 
which we have found to characterize the best subjective 
ones. Such a lyric is the perfect first half of Shelley's 
fragment " Summer and Winter "; another is the lines 
of Keats, 

' The clouds were pure and white as flocks new-shorn, 
And fresh from the clear brook ; sweetly they slept 
On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept 
A little noiseless noise among the leaves," 
and so on. Another is Frederick Tennyson's "The 
Blackbird." Perhaps Shelley's "The Question" is the 
highest example of the kind, showing as it does how 
even a " landscape inventory " may be a repository of 
covert feeling and suggestion through the magic of 
lyric art. 

But, it will be said, whatever one's theory of this art, 
the fact remains that it is not popular. Is the circum- 
stance accidental or essential ? The writer inclines to 
the former view. Since we have learned that the emo- 
tions have a physical basis, it may be said that the phys- 
ical capacity of the heart or emotional soul is, like that 
of the brain, limited. The strenuous clanking of the 
machinery of what constitutes the life of nearly all is 
too obstreperous for even musically attuned ears to dis- 
tinguish delicate strains through. In the comparative 
neglect of the lyric under ordinary conditions of exist- 
ence may be faintly discerned a proof of its inherent 
and future supremacy. It is quite conceivable and 
possible that many more may be fitted to learn to appre- 
ciate lyric art (as one learns to understand the highest 
music) than ever have the opportunity presented to 
them, or the least incentive to acquire it. Not only is 
sensitiveness requisite, but also an absorption and a calm 
quite beyond the material reach of most, and this, too, 
in exact proportion to the value of the art product. 
Neither Schubert nor Keats can make their message 
heard in the hurly-burly of ordinary life, though the 
ears and the eyes have their will; but the Gospel Hymns, 
and novels, are understood and appreciated. Even 
among cultured people of leisure, one may question 
whether the art (for such it is) of reading lyric poetry 
is widely known. How many readers of this journal 
have assimilated all the few great inspired lyrics of 
the English tongue alone, on a hundred occasions, more 
or less, each time letting every ramification of thought, 
every turn of phrase, every shade of expression, every 
step toward the central emotion, every association and 
every picture called up, filter imperceptibly through the 
consciousness in slow repeated readings ? It takes twenty 
or thirty minutes to properly construe " Tears, idle tears," 
and unless this is done spontaneously, the time is wasted. 
In this respect music has the advantage, for any pro- 
duction may be more or less of an exercise in technique, 
if nothing more. Small wonder that we are fairly famil- 
iar with the requirements of musical training, but bar- 



barians in pure literature. Formal class-room training 
for poetic appreciation, in mediocre hands defeats its 
own object; hence, very wisely, is generally omitted. 
The seclusion of soul so necessary for the first stages of 
the growth of the tender plant of poetic feeling is con- 
spicuous by its absence in contemporary society, for 
many reasons having no close relation to capabilities in 
that direction. Certain subordinate characteristics, how- 
ever, which mark off some varieties of poetry as narra- 
tive or dramatic, make somewhat easier an approxima- 
tion to poetic culture along those lines. Hence it is that 
we have something called by that name, which, lured 

largely by external trappings plot and personality 

is disposed to be indifferent to the absorbing, exclusive, 
imperative requirements of due familiarity with lyric 
art. However, it is in any case not absolutely necessary 
to prove that what the public does not want would be 
good for it. There are all shades of Philistinism. 

So much depends on the point of view, that one is 
almost tempted to wander into a disquisition on the 
immediateness and particularity of fiction and the drama, 
as distinguishing characteristics of non-lyric production. 
It is at least true that in proportion as the personalities 
treated are more sharply defined, they are more circum- 
scribed in their application than the best lyric entities; 
for one does not willingly identify himself with a dif- 
ferent external individuality; and, apart from their suc- 
cess as portraits or creations, they attain their greatest 
power when least limited in qualities affecting the sym- 
pathy of the reader, as distinguished from his curiosity 
or wonder. But sympathy is a peculiarly lyrical emotion. 
The point of view, again, makes it possible to say as 
much on one side as on the other on the question whether 
men's souls find their needs better met by coming to a 
conclusion of weight after a contemplation of a long, 
complex series of external actions, or by reaching the 
same inference through the medium of subtle suggestion 
in the light of the understanding furnished by personal 
experience. The former process is doubtless at present 
better adapted to further a spiritual growth of the 
masses, hampered as they are by the stress of living. 
But it does not seem clear in what the implied intrinsic 
inferiority of the latter consists, since its lack of ideality 
is apparent instead of real. Any species of literature, 
as distinguished from knowledge, exalts only in so far 
as it confirms or intensifies our range of experience. 
Poetry is intuition, eternal fitness, through but not be- 
cause of thought. It is a tacit recognition of, and en- 
thusiasm for, moral principles so fundamental in their 
nature that the poet's sole office, as such, is to recall 
to the minds of men that they are, without a syllable 
of didacticism, or of explanation, not potential in the 
hearer. Evidently, this is accomplished by evoking con- 
crete transfusing emotions. Whether these incentives 
to insight are or are not cast in dramatic form would 
seem to be a minor consideration. The Ivric, the dra- 
matic, and the narrative treatments are but different 
modes of attaining the same end, the choice of the mode 
being dependent on comparatively adventitious circum- 
stances. The lyric is the more sympathetic; the non- 
lyric is the clearer, more vivid, because it appeals to the 
external attention. 

If in the dim future lies a period when literature shall 
be exempt from fashion or groping " tendencies," and 
valued for its permanent elements, the conclusion does 
not as yet seem inevitable that lyric art will occupy 
second place. F L THOMPSOX-

[May 1, 



MEMOIRS or AN IRISH NATIONALIST.* 

Sir Charles Gavan Duffy is one of the many 
Irishmen who, leaving their native country to 
seek a more congenial political clime abroad, 
have shown through a career of distinguished 
public services in the land of their adoption how 
questionable is the charge of political worthless- 
ness levelled against them in the land of their 
birth. A Celt, a Catholic, a whilom " rebel," Sir 
Charles is distinctively a member of that class 
of his countrymen of whom it is freely asserted 
that they can neither govern nor be governed ; 
and it is not uninstructive to note, as possibly 
serving to cast some light on the merits of this 
sweeping proposition, that while in the one hem- 
isphere Sir Charles's public activities landed 
him eventually in Newgate, in the other they 
culminated in a premiership. It would seem 
to be Erin's hard lot that all countries save her 
are free to profit by and suitably recognize the 
abilities of her sons. 

Sir Charles has, to our thinking, devoted a 
rather disproportionate share of his usually 
lively and entertaining memoir to events and 
measures which properly belong to general Irish 
history, and which he has already discussed with 
all the fulness they deserve in a professedly 
historical work. It would, of course, have been 
virtually impossible for him to have told the 
story of his life, or of the earlier phase of it at 
least, without touching pretty frequently on the 
topics in question, for his career has been, as 
all know, closely identified with the Irish nation- 
alist cause. It may even be said that his sobri- 
quet of the " Irish Mazzini " is not altogether 
ill-deserved, since it is undoubtedly largely ow- 
ing to Sir Charles Gavan Duffy's intelligent 
work as a political propagandist that anything 
like a really considerable and pervasive senti- 
ment or consciousness of Irish nationalism ex- 
ists to-day. Our present complaint, however, 
is that Sir Charles, with a self-effacement rare

of his own story proper to range afield into the 
not very edifying annals of the Repeal and

and Irish wrongs and abortive Irish enterprises,

to turn a somewhat impatient ear, getting into 
his recital very much as King Charles's head got

into the memorial of David Copperfield's friend 
Mr. Dick. Even the author's Hibernian read- 
irs, we fancy, will grudge the space he bestows 
on the familiar records of O'Connell's " bluff- 
ing " agitation with its sorry collapse at Clon- 
tarf, the callow Young Ireland movement with 
its sham Girondism and rapturous schoolboy 
enthusiasm for French and Hellenic models, 
the Smith O'Brien " rebellion " with its farcical 
end in a cabbage-garden, and the rest of it. 
Into the larger record of these events Sir 
Charles does not go in extenso ; but he thinks 
it worth while to try to clear up for the world 
the by no means delectable inside history of 
the paltry squabbles of the nationalist leaders 
among themselves, which did so much to alien- 
ate foreign sympathy and served to breed a 
pretty general doubt of the ability of Irishmen 
to cooperate for long cordially and unitedly in 
the Irish cause. 

Having prefaced so much by way of stricture, 
we hasten to say that the story of our author's 
romantic and checkered career as journalist, 
revolutionist, prisoner of state in the one hem- 
isphere, and as politician, statesman, and Prime 
Minister in the other is well worth the telling, 
and it is told so well, where the author adheres 
to it, that the reader grudges the more the space 
given over to the digressions already noted. 
The opening chapter is devoted to an account 
of the author's boyhood and youth in the Ulster 
town of Monaghan, and the remainder of the 
first volume and about one-third of the second 
are taken up with his experiences as journalist 
and agitator, and with the story of the fortunes 
of the earlier Irish nationalist movement gen- 
erally, its rise, culmination, disintegration, and 
decline, down to the date of his departure for 
a more promising field of political activity in 
the new hemisphere. It was in 1855 that Sir 
Charles, despairing of an Ireland " where Mr. 
Keogh typified patriotism and Dr. Cullen the 
Church," sailed for the South Pacific ; and the 
final two-thirds of his concluding volume deal 
largely with events of Australasian political 
history in which the writer bore a conspicuous 
and honorable part. When Sir Charles arrived 
at Melbourne the motley population of that now 
handsome and thriving city was just beginning 
to settle down into a semblance of old-world 
social decorum, and he preserves some racy pic- 
tures of the manners that prevailed during the 
saturnalia following the discovery of gold. The 
dominant class (while their " luck " lasted) 
were the " new aristocracy " of successful dig- 
gers, who used to flock into town laden with

" dust " and nuggets, bent on an orgy to com- 
pensate them for a season of hard work and 
enforced abstinence. 

" Drunkenness was their ordinary enjoyment, and the 
public houses swarmed at all hours of the day and night 
with roaring or maudlin topers. The mad recklessness 
of that time exceeds all belief. I have heard from eye- 
witnesses stories of diggers ordering the entire stock of 
champagne in a public house to be decanted into wash- 
tubs, and stopping every passer-by with an invitation to 
swill; of one frantic toper, when he had made all com- 
ers drunk, insisting upon having the bar counters washed 
with claret; of pier-glasses smashed with a stock-whip in 
order to make an item worth the attention of a million- 
aire ; of diggers throwing down nuggets to pay for a dram ; 
of pipes lighted with a cheque; of sandwiches lined with 
banknotes. A favorite recreation of the digger on his 
pleasure trip was to get married. A bride was not diffi- 
cult to discover, who permitted herself on short notice to 
be adorned with showy silks and driven in an equipage 
as fine as the circumstances permitted to a bridal which, 
in many cases, bound them together only during good 
pleasure." 

Like many young towns of a type familiar in 
this country, Melbourne in 1855, though still a 
straggling village in the by-streets of which 
stumps of primeval trees were visible, had 
grandiose views of its immediate future. The 
Public Works department was housed in a 
shanty, and the Law Offices held sway in a 
vacant corn store ; but high-sounding names of 
streets and buildings were rife, and a new Par- 
liament House was planned on a scale so gor- 
geous that after forty years it is not yet finished. 
There was already a creditable Public Library 
building, stocked with a strange assortment of 
books that might, one fancies, have been se- 
lected by some humorous digger, of a bookish 
turn, by way of a joke on his unlettered fellow 
townsmen. 

" The modern poets were represented by Samuel 
Rogers and a single poem of Tennyson's. The modern 
novelists stopped with Scott. . . . But the antiquities 
of Athens and Attica were abundantly represented. 
Three hundred volumes of Greek and Latin classics and 
the Book of Common Prayer in German, French, Italian, 
Greek, modern Greek, and Spanish; twelve volumes of 
the Bridgewater Treatises and their antithesis, Hobbes. 
in sixteen volumes were offered as refreshment to the 
weary." 

These matters, of course, are mended in modern 
Melbourne, where the visiting stranger can now 
walk at will into the same building, and find 
himself " as conveniently provided with facili- 
ties for study as in the reading-room of the 
British Museum." 

Of the humors of Australian political life, 
Sir Charles preserves a number of specimens 
which may be exemplified by the following brace 
of parliamentary stories. 

" R. C. Aspiuall was a great humorist, and everybody 



could cite some happy mots of his, as notable for prompt- 
ness as for felicity. He was addressing the House some- 
what vaguely one evening, when a member of Cockney 
genesis interposed with a question to the Speaker, ' May 
I ask, sir, what is before the 'Ouse ? ' An H, I sub- 
mit,' says Aspinall. . . . Dr. Evans said good things, 
but they were witty and wise rather than humorous. 
He was an old man, and it had become a familiar joke 
to speak of him as belonging to the era of Queen Anne. 
On some occasion when he referred to Queen Anne in a 
speech there were various cries of ' Did you know her ? 
What was she like ? ' ' Yes, sir,' rejoined the Doctor, 
' I did know her. The scholar is contemporary with all 
time.' " 

Sir Charles has judiciously leavened his ac- 
count of his dual public career with a due admix- 
ture of reminiscences and pen-sketches of celeb- 
rities he has seen and known. Early on the 
list of these is Tom Moore, of whom the writer 
had a glimpse while employed on the Dublin 
" Register " late in the thirties. He had sat 
down to luncheon on a Sunday, and was sum- 
moned below by a message from a gentleman 
on urgent business. 

" When I descended I found a little, middle-aged 
man, with a pleasant smile and lively eyes, but of a coun- 
tenance far from comely, and so elaborately dressed that 
the primrose gloves which he wore did not seem out of 
harmony with the splendor of his attire. But my interest 
was awakened in an instant when he told me his ' name 
was Moore Thomas Moore.' He had come to ask for 
a proof of some words spoken the night before at the 
theatre on a universal call from the house. I knew the 
Irish melodies from boyhood. Later I had learned to 
taste the bitter-sweet of his political squibs, and revel in 
the veiled sedition of The Fireworshippers.' There 
was probably no one living I would have seen with more 
satisfaction, and he enjoyed my sympathy." 

Sir Charles was returned as a member of the 
House of Commons in 1852, and his diary of 
that period furnishes some lively pen-portraits 
of notable colleagues. 

" The most striking figure in the assembly was its 
official leader, Mr. Disraeli. In the front benches, 
crowded with Englishmen, for the most part bright com- 
plexioned and always punctiliously fresh in linen and 
visage, sat a man approaching fifty, with swarthy fea- 
tures and a complexion which had once been olive, on 
every lineament of which was written foreigner and 
alien. It was not an uncomely face, and far from un- 
impressive, but it was conspicuously un-English. Mas- 
culine will and unflinching purpose might be read, it 
seemed to me, in the firm mouth and strong jaw gifts 
worth nearly all the rest in the art of governing men. 
He dressed in complete disregard of conventional preju- 
dices. A Chancellor of the Exchequer in a plum-colored 
vest was a sight as perplexing to trim propriety as Ro- 
land's shoe-ties in the court of Louis XVI. And he 
cultivated on his chin an ornament rarely seen and little 
loved north of Calais, a goatee. . . . Some of his post- 
prandial mots steal out, and I should think make fatal 
enemies. Somebody asked him lately if Lord Robert M. 
was not a stupid ass. ' No, no,' said Benjamin, ' not at 
all; he is a clever ass.' . . . Mr. Gladstone was not yet 
the official leader of the Feelites, but he was the most

noteworthy of them, and attracted close observation. 
He was habitually grave, it seemed to me, and spoke as 
if he uttered oracles, yet he left the impression that his 
speeches were not only improvised, but that the process 
of adopting a conclusion was not always complete when 
he rose to speak. But the vigor and grace of his rhet- 
oric put criticism to flight. The House, which relished 
the persiflage of Palmerston, thought Gladstone too seri- 
ious, and resented a little, I think, the subdued tone of 
contemptuous superiority in which he addressed the 
leader of the House. . . . Palmerston has a gay, 
debonair appearance, which finds much favor with the 
House, but on me he makes the impression of a play- 
actor cast in the part of a patriot statesman. Carlyle 
says he is a fitting leader for an age without sincerity 
or veracity." 

We shall close our citations with the follow- 
ing caustic note of Sir Charles's " last look at 
the House of Lords " (1855) : 

" There is as large a proportion of commonplace men 
as I have ever seen in any assembly of gentlemen 
Lord Grey, far from inheriting the noble- domed fore- 
head of his father, looks as he hobbles along shrewd and 
ordinary an attorney or land-agent; Lord Panmure, 
with his port wine complexion and costume of a ci-devant 
jeune homme, might be a retired stock-broker; the Duke 
of Newcastle, a wooden mediocrity without a ray of the 
divine light of intellect; Lord Derby looks like a Lord 
John Russell with a soul, but that makes a profound 
difference. . . . Lord Ellenborough spoke without force 
or fire; Lord Aberdeen like a Puritan preacher, he is 
highly respectable, solemn, and discontented. . . . Sir 
De Lacy Evans, the commander of the not too respect- 
able Spanish brigade, is a noble, soldierly-looking man, 
whose profession immediately suggests itself; whereas 
Lord Hardinge, a great soldier, is nothing short of mean 
and ugly, and might pass for a Common Council man; 
and the Duke of Cambridge, illustrious by birth and 
courtesy, is big, brawny, and resembles a sergeant of 
dragoons." 

The reader will find these two handsome vol- 
umes well freighted with matter of entertain- 
ment and information. E. G. J. 



KON-RELJGION IN THE FUTURE.* 

Drelincourt once brought together two hun- 
dred and sixty-two hypotheses regarding sex 
which he demonstrated to be groundless, only 
to have Blumenbach characterize his own theory 
as the two hundred and sixty-third. So, when 
M. Guyau takes up the philosophical systems 
of his predecessors, each fondly believed by its 
author to contain the method by which all future 
thought is to be guided, curiosity is at once 
excited to see whether he will himself propose 
some similarly pretentious metaphysical pan- 
acea. This curiosity, to tell the truth, animates 
the reader quite to the final page of the com- 

*THE NON-RELIGION OF THE FUTURE: A Sociological 
Study. By M. Quyau. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



pendious volume which he calls " The Non- 
Religion of the Future." When concluded, a 
feeling of admiration succeeds admiration 
for the dexterity with which M. Guyau has 
permitted his own thought to be interpreted 
in terms of the others. If he escapes critical 
responsibility thereby, he also fails to outline a 
complete system of what, in his judgment, the 
world will come to accept instead of existing 
creeds. Though monism unquestionably makes 
the strongest appeal to the author in this regard, 
he does not hold it as containing the final word, 
but seems rather to believe that it will open a 
way for something conclusive. 

Polemic as such a work must necessarily be, 
the construction of this is singularly likely to 
provoke controversy. Though simple in plan, 
every detail is certain to call forth objection, if 
not objurgation. M. Guyau is convinced that 
religion is doomed, that human progress is away 
from all faith, that time only is needed wherein 
to wean humankind from the churchly pabulum 
which has heretofore been, in all stages of its 
progress, its chief intellectual nourishment. He 
supports his assumption with much direct argu- 
ment ; but nothing of all that he adduces in 
this way is so impressive and so provocative of 
dissent as the self-satisfied manner in which he 
marshals the effects of vanished religion 
upon the human world and all its components, 
the church, the state, the family, the man, the 
woman, the child everything is examined in 
the light of his thesis and his conclusions set 
down in a detail which becomes too abundant. 
Then, having divested mankind of all these 
superfluities and superstitions, he unfolds, sys- 
tematizes, and examines the philosophies capa- 
ble of substitution : theism, atheism, pantheism, 
idealism, materialism, monism. 

The book has for its secondary title " A 
Sociological Study," and it is a conception of 
deity as sociomorphic (a hideous word), rather 
than anthropomorphic, which appears to be its 
principal original contribution to a study of the 
religious question. M. Guyau shows an inti- 
mate acquaintance with many of the authorities, 
English and American as well as French and 
German, yet he omits mention of the late 
William Kingdon Clifford, whose unfinished 
essays on " The Scientific Basis of Morals " and 
kindred topics occupy substantially the same 
grounds as his own Introduction in attributing 
the origin of the gods and divine law to an 
extension of the social sense. " Religion was 
in the beginning nothing more than an imagin- 
ative extension of human society," says M. 



1898.] 



THE DIAL,

Guyau. " In the highest natures the tribal self 
is incarnate in nothing less than humanity," 
says Clifford ; and the statements indicate their 
agreements not less than their divergences. 
Both find a social origin for conscience and 
both illustrate that trend of modern thought 
whereby sociology is taking to itself the pre- 
eminent position once occupied by theology as 
*' Queen of the Sciences." 

The development of the discussion involves 
the philosopher here in a consideration of the 
questions of the day. Socialism, commercialism, 
and fifty more " current topics," find place in 
our author's pages, and are made to fit skilfully 
into the mosaic which reflects his own views. 
In the population sense, he finds the one thing 
which he admits to be present in religion and 
absent from any of its possible substitutes ; the 
fact that religion has already failed in this re- 
gard in his own France apparently not occur- 
ring to him. As successive chapters consider 
allied topics from various points of view, the 
book, from being contemporaneous becomes 
repetitious and discursive, the slender thread of 
its author's views being broken too often by the 
heavy matters he takes from others to hang to it. 

Moreover, the book is frequently inaccurate 
in detail, however successfully it may set forth 
certain broad truths. What, for instance, can be 
made of such a judgment as this : " The ideas of 
Kant and Schelling, when they passed into Amer- 
ica, gave birth to Emerson's and Parker's trans- 
cendentalism ; Spencer's theory of evolution be- 
came, in America, a religion of Cosmism, as 
presented by Messrs. Fiske, Potter, and Sav- 
age " ? The Ethical Culture movement is to 
M. Guyau " simply a great mutual aid temper- 
ance society," a rather wild characterization, 
for which the translator is probably responsible. 
Yet he hastens to add that " it is certainly one 
of the forms of social activity which are des- 
tined to succeed ritualistic religions." 

The fundamental objections to M. Guyau's 
general contention are two, one logical and one 
practical. Define religion as he will, he merely 
escapes from one definition to another in throw- 
ing from it the cloak of dogma. His invention 
of " non-religion " and " a-religion " cannot 
blind his readers to the fact that even in that 
term all that is " religious " in a very real sense 
all that Clifford includes under the word 
*' piety " is retained. Even his climax, a state- 
ment of the ideal conditions which may be 
evoked in the non-religious society of the future, 
is based upon a theory of human love which is 
assuredly of the essence of theoretical Chris- 



tianity. Here he depends upon his imagination 
only to prove his own dictum that " imagin- 
ation usually plays with loaded dice." In this 
consideration his boasted logic fails to hold to- 
gether. On the other hand, he has neglected 
a practical method for testing his main hypoth- 
esis. France, he contends, is already non- 
religious, especially in respect of its men of 
affairs. Would it not have been more profit- 
able, to theologians, sociologists, and philoso- 
phers generally, if he had told us what the 
trend of thought is there, as a matter of fact, 
rather than to speculate upon what it is going 
to be throughout the world, as a matter of con- 
jecture ? M. Guyau permits himself to exam- 
ine successively the metaphysical systems from 
which he believes the substitute for religion will 
arise, in the midst of a society which his con- 
text discloses as swayed by a multitude of con- 
siderations ; and never a metaphysical one 
among them. Does not the simple statement 
of his ideal carry with it its own refutation ? 
The curse of labor being upon us, can the hu- 
man race as a whole ever look forward to a calm 
and equable life under the bland light of ab- 
stract reasoning ? " There are no lacunas in 
the human soul, it is a prey to invincible con- 
tinuity," he says, profoundly enough. But in 
all the panorama, from the " sociomorphism " 
of the present to the metaphysical contentment 
of a vastly remote future, does he not assume 
a breach of continuity ? Is there not before the 
student a condition of affairs in France to-day 
which is equally aloof from M. Guyau's " re- 
ligion " and "non-religion"? a literal solu- 
tion of the continuity he seeks for his pro- 
gramme ? 

It is not unlikely that many of the difficulties 
which oppress the reader of this work are due 
to the translation. Hardly a page remains un- 
marred by solecisms and sentences so entangled 
that a guess at their meaning is all that is left. 
It would seem as if there had been a collabora- 
tion some person not too familiar with French 
being assisted by some one lacking in English. 
Open the book at random, and one will find 
such a mixture as this : " They [the Jesuits] 
have even been accused of whispering to advice 
for the preservation of certain inheritances " 
(p. 328). " What the Germans call the heart 
of nature ' " comes to be, in its passage from 
French to English, an Irish bull. Money, ther- 
mometric degrees, and the like, are indicated 
by figures alone, leaving it wholly indeterminate 
what standard is intended. In proper names 
there is nothing short of an orgy : " Servetius "

WALLACE DE GROOT EICE. 



HITTELL'S HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA.* 



Enough " History of California " to satisfy 
the most enthusiastic dwellers by the Golden 
Gate is given in Mr. Theodore H. Hittell's four 
thick octavo volumes that together foot up 
8460 pages. This unreasonable voluminous- 
ness is due to the introduction of matter that 
is either foreign to the subject or is of too little 
consequence to justify its introduction into a 
State history ; or to pure prolixity. The rela- 
tions of California to the Union in the Civil 
War is an interesting topic, for example, and 
should be fully and clearly stated in such a 
work ; but no possible reason can be assigned 
for giving a comparatively full account of the 
whole Civil War. What the " Battle above 
the Clouds" and "Sheridan's Ride" have to 
do with the history of California, it would be 
hard to say ; but here they are, nevertheless. 
Another kind of bad judgment is illustrated by 
the introduction into the final chapter of an 
account, a page and a half in length, of the 
attempt that was made to induce the legislature 
of California to buy Mr. Hubert H. Bancroft's 
books and manuscripts, which is characterized 
in no kindly terms. Delicate professional feel- 
ing, as well as sense of proportion, would have 
suggested that the incident be omitted alto- 
gether or be relegated to a brief foot-note. 

The impression made by the external features 
of the work is confirmed by its internal ones. 
It is a ponderous performance. The author 
piles up facts, gathered from a vast number of 
sources, with great zeal and industry, mountain 
high ; but the book is heavy reading. Open it 
anywhere you please, and you are struck by its 
ponderousness. Nor is it the matter alone that 
makes the book heavy ; in fact, matter and 
manner are very well suited to each other. The 
style is generally laborious. The result is that 
the reader who goes through the work will be 
carried along by his own interest in the subject, 
or in the matter, not by the writer's skill. Such 
a reader may find the long way attractive, but 
not because he is beguiled by the historian's art. 

It is almost unnecessary to say that Califor-

four volumes. San Francisco : N. J. Stone & Co. 



nia offers to the historian an extensive and an 
attractive field. It embraces interesting ele- 
ments of the most varied character, extending 
from the time of Hernando Cortez to the time 
of Senator Hearst. Here are sections bearing 
such headings as " Early Voyages," " The Jes- 
uits," "The Franciscans," "Early Mining," 
" The Spanish Governors," " The Mexican 
Governors "; and it is needless to say that they 
are very inviting, especially when considered 
in the two environments furnished by nature 
and history. All these subjects, and others too, 
the author has investigated with much care and 
thoroughness ; he has made a valuable contri- 
bution to fact or information ; and it is to be 
regretted that he was unable to work his mate- 
rial, or rather so much of it as he should have 
used, into a more attractive form. 

Different classes of readers will find the 
centre of interest in different parts of the work ; 
but the ordinary reader, we hazard little in 
saying, will find it in those chapters that pre- 
sent the series of events that led up to the Amer- 
ican occupation and conquest of California in 
18467, and its admission to the Union three 
years later. When everything is taken into 
account, these events are hardly second in ro- 
mantic interest to any others in our national his- 
tory, and it must be said, in justice to Mr. Hit- 
tell, that he has given us a very full account of 
them. 

The Spaniards in California, like Spaniard* 
in other parts of America, were thoroughly 
jealous of foreigners. Especially, the Spanish 
authorities on the Coast, like the Spanish author- 
ities in Louisiana in the last quarter of the eigh- 
teenth century, had a premonition of what the 
coming of the American meant. Curiously 
enough, too, the story opens in California with 
the publication, in 1796, of the treaty of San 
Lorenzo, which put the old quarrels between the 
two countries in relation to boundaries and the 
use of the Mississippi in the way of settlement. 
" Towards the end of the same year," our author 
tells us, " the ship ' Otter,' of Boston, Captain 
Ebenezer Dorr, the first American vessel that 
visited California, ran into Monterey and sur- 
reptitiously left a few of its sailors, some for- 
eigners and some English." The Spanish gov- 
ernor, after utilizing these sailors in various 
ways for a time, sent them out of the country. 
The impression prevailed that American ves- 
sels which came to the Coast were engaged in 
contraband trade ; and this impression Mr. 
Hittell thinks was probably well founded. On 
that ground, at least, the second ship to arrive,

which was in 1799, was compelled to leave with- 
out delay. And, generally speaking, we may 
say that from this time on the American and 
the Spaniard were at a point of friction on the 
Pacific Coast as well as in the Gulf of Mexico, 
although for many years the more distant point 
attracted little or no attention, owing in great 
part to the absorbing interest with which the 
nearer one was regarded. Ominously enough, 
however, the century closed with " considerable 
talk of an American invasion that is, of an 
attempt by the rising young giant on the other 
side of the continent to take not only California, 
but all New Spain." It was not until 1823 
that an American was allowed to settle in the 
country. The first American business house 
was established in 1824. The first American 
party to arrive overland came in 1826, and 
seems to have been the result of an accident, as 
follows : 

"Towards the end of 1826 the Californians were 
astonished by the appearance in their country of the first 
party of Americans that came overland. This was a 
small company of hunters and trappers, under the com- 
mand of Captain Jedediah S. Smith, of the firm of 
Smith, Jackson, & Soublette. They had been author- 
ized by the United States Executive to hunt and trade 
in the territories west of the Rocky Mountains, and 
had established their headquarters on the eastern side 
of Salt Lake. In August they had left Salt Lake on a 
hunting and trapping excursion, and, travelling south- 
westward, had at length found themselves in a desert 
country near the Colorado River, and in great want 
of subsistence for themselves and horses. Being five 
hundred miles from Salt Lake and less than three hun- 
dred from the mission of San Gabriel in California, they 
determined to proceed to the latter place, and finally 
arrived there, very much exhausted. Immediately upon 
their arrival, Smith addressed a letter to Governor 
Echeandia, then at San Diego, describing their situation 
and necessities. Echeandia answered by ordering Smith 
to appear at that place and give an account of himself 
and of his reasons for coming to the country. Smith did 
so; but his story seems to have been doubted. He then 
appealed to a number of ships' captains who were at that 
port; and they joined in a written declaration to the 
effect that they believed his account, and that his only 
object in visiting the country was such as he had stated." 

Smith is said to have lost his life while 
attempting to make his way back to Salt Lake. 
The visit was a very unwelcome one, and in- 
creased the growing tension between the Cali- 
fornians and the Americans. But there was no 
resisting the inevitable ; the American popula- 
tion continued slowly to increase. Shortly 
after Smith's departure a report was circulated 
that the United States were about to take Cali- 
fornia, as they had already taken Florida. From 
this time until the end the action becomes more 
and more accelerated and more and more inter- 
esting. With the breaking out of the Mexican 



War, Fremont, Sloat, and Stockton came, and 
California passed from the keeping of the Mex- 
ican to that of the American, as it had before 
passed from the Spaniard to the Mexican. But 
we cannot follow the story. 

Full of information as the book is, it must 
depend mainly upon State patriotism for its 
circulation. The author has facilitated the 
work of those who wish to consult his volumes 
(which is sure to be a much larger class than 
those who actually read them) by furnishing a 
full index as well as an ample table of contents.

RECENT HISTORICAL, FICTION.* 



It would be instructive to compare Mr. E. F. 
Benson's " The Vintage," a romance of the Greek 
War of Independence, with the romance of the 
Greek writer Xenos, recently reviewed by us, deal- 
ing with the same theme. One might reasonably 
suppose that the advantage would be almost wholly 
with the novelist who was writing of the great period 
of his own national history, and that the best any 
Englishman could do would be to produce a pale 
and colorless reflection of the stirring events of the

of his information and the stress of his emotion that 
artistic grasp is denied him, whereas the English 
novelist with adequate literary training, backed by 
the continuous tradition of good fiction- writing which 
is his birthright, succeeds in making from his alien 
point of view a stronger and in every way finer 
treatment of the subject. The work of Xenos, hur- 
rying from detail to detail, is weighted down to the 
level of a chronicle, while the work of Mr. Benson, 
who knows how to select and arrange, rises to the 
level of serious and impressive art. The English 
writer does not even have to rely upon the names 
and events which are in themselves an element of 
strength, so deep are the associations they bear ; he 
tells us nothing of Marcos Botsaris or of Misolonghi 
or of Navarino, and yet he makes us feel to the full 
the heroic passion of the struggle. The chief histor- 
ical episode of this romance is the siege and fall of 
Tripoli, and to this climax the events lead up with 
ever- accumulating interest. The well-chosen figure 
of speech embodied in the title of the book is kept 
in mind throughout, yet not made obtrusive, being 
relegated to section-headings and chance phrases 
rather than made a theme for rhetorical amplifica- 
tions. " The Vintage " is much the best piece of 
work that Mr. Benson has thus far done, and for its 
sake we may well forgive him for his " Dodo " and 
other futilities. 

" The Son of the Czar " is a long historical ro- 
mance of early eighteenth century Russia, and has 
for its chief characters Peter the Great and his un- 
happy son Alexis. The exact period is that of the 
beginnings of the new capital upon the marshy 
shores of the Neva, and the book is essentially a 
depiction of the great struggle of the radical em- 
peror with the bigoted conservatism of his semi- 
barbarous people. The instincts of Peter were so 
entirely right that they go far to condone the brutal- 
ities that marked his policy, and we cannot greatly 
blame a writer of historical fiction for idealizing 
his character and to a certain extent justifying the 
means that he was forced to employ for the further- 
ance of bis great ends. Historians have been apt 
to regard his treatment of Alexis as one of the dark- 
est blots upon his fame, but as the relation is pre- 
sented to us by Mr. Graham, Alexis got no more 
than his despicable character and treacherous de- 
vices fairly earned for him. If this presentation of 
Peter as an essentially wise and humane ruler be 
colored by too much hero-worship, it is made for 
the time almost convincing by the eloquence of the 
writer. It is evident, also, that Mr. Graham, has 
been a minute student of his subject, for his book 
has a great deal of historical actuality, and never 
descends to the level of rhetorical commonplace. It 
is, moreover, self-consistent, and its chief artistic 
defect results from the author's inability to make 
an orderly array of so great a store of information. 

The nihilists are just now having their innings 
again in fiction. Mr. Fred Whishaw's " A Tsar's 
Gratitude " is a story which begins with the engage- 
ment at Inkermann, and ends with an unsuccessful 



attempt to assassinate Alexander II. As far as ma- 
chinery goes, it is much the same sort of story that 
we have read many times before. The conspirators 
live in the same atmosphere of secrecy and terror- 
ism, and are invested with the same uncanny power 
to control the machinery of state up to a certain 
point in the interest of their dastardly aims. The 
hero is an officer in the Russian army who, through 
no fault of his own, incurs the disfavor of the Tsar, 
but whose loyalty remains unshaken through trials 
that would almost justify him in revolt. When he 
eventually saves his ruler's life at the risk of his 
own, the Tsar's gratitude becomes as generous as 
his previous ingratitude had been unworthy, and the 
story thus justifies its title, while coming to a happy 
conclusion. It is written in a rather dull style, and 
bears a good deal of skipping. 

Mr. Pett Ridge's " Secretary to Bayne, M. P.," 
deals only indirectly with Russian affairs, since its 
scene is laid mainly in London, and its nihilists are 
ruffians of a rather cheap description. It is the 
story of a Prince of Galmada, who goes to London 
incognito to see the world, and also to discover the 
whereabouts of one Olga Netroff, whom he loves. 
The girl turns out to be implicated, innocently 
enough, in certain nihilist conspiracies, and in his 
endeavor to get her away from her criminal envir- 
onment, the Prince barely escapes with his own life. 
The story, which ends happily, is told with consid- 
erable animation, and provides a very satisfactory 
sort of entertainment. 

Mr. Weyman's " Shrewsbury " is a historical ro- 
mance of which the scene is laid in the England of 
William III., and which has for its central episode 
the attempt of Sir John Fenwick and his fellow- 
conspirators to assassinate the great champion of 
civil liberties and the Protestant faith. It is a very 
long romance, which fact will delight all lovers of 
the species who are acquainted as who of them 
are not? with the other inventions of this fasci- 
nating writer. We notice in this book what we no- 
ticed in " My Lady Rotha," a tendency so to enlarge 
the scale and scope of a romance as to obscure the 
pattern, and make it somewhat difficult for readers 
to view the performance as a symmetrical whole. 
For clearness of outline and unity of plan, Mr. Wey- 
man's slighter early books were better than the more 
ambitious ones he has produced of late. Still, we 
have read " Shrewsbury " with much satisfaction, 
despite the fact that the hero (who tells the story) 
is little short of a knave and nothing short of a 
coward. Among the historical characters intro- 
duced, we have Fenwick, the notorious Ferguson, 
Godolphin, Marlborough, and the King, and alto- 
gether the book offers us a vivid picture of the troub- 
lous times when the Protestant succession was still 
in question, besides abounding in stirring incidents 
and hair-breadth escapes. 

Mr. " Anthony Hope " takes us some score of 
years further back in English history when we open 
the pages of " Simon Dale," for the chronicler of 
imaginary royalties and principalities has at last

come to the historical novel pare and simple, and 
given us a story of the Restoration that proves un- 
failing in its power to excite and sustain the interest, 
although its audacities of invention at times take 
away the breath. The infamous Treaty of Dover 
affords the chief subject-matter of this romance, and 
the incognito presence of the Roi Soleil at the place 
of negotiation gives the hero an opportunity for 
dealing with him in the most surprising manner. The 
treatment to which he is subjected in the " Vicomte 
de Bragelonne " is no more startling than that which 
he is made to endure at the hands of the bold and 
sturdy Simon, who not only talks to him in the 
" cheekiest " fashion at Dover, but actually gets him 
alone in an open boat, and exacts from him an un- 
willing compliance at the pistol's muzzle. The affec- 
tions of this audacious hero are divided between the 
high-born lady whom he rescues from the net of 
royal intrigue into which she has fallen, and the 
well-known favorite, Nell Gwynne, of whom the 
novelist draws so engaging a portrait that we cannot 
help liking her better than the proper heroine of 
the romance. We are glad, on the whole, that Mr. 
Hawkins has sold his fancy into captivity to the 
facts of history, for we have no fear that his work 
will suffer from a too slavish adherence to them, and 
it is, after all, better to dwell upon the solid ground 
of the actual than in cloud-built towers and gorgeous 
palaces that never had any real existence. 

We should judge Mr. Herman Koerner to be a 
novice in the writing of romantic fiction. " Belea- 
guered " is a story that drags considerably and dis- 
plays slight inventive resource. Given a fortified 
town in the early Thirty Years War, held by the 
imperialists and besieged by the Swedes, given also 
a heroic defender and a lovely maiden, most of the 
details follow as a matter of course. There is a great 
deal of fighting in the book, besides minor adven- 
tures and intrigues, but a certain stiffness of manner 
pervades the whole production and prevents it from 
being at all inspiring. 

" Across the Salt Seas," by Mr. John Bloundelle- 
Bnrton, is a story of the War of the Spanish Suc- 
cession. An English soldier is entrusted with a 
secret mission to Spain, which results in the capture 
of a fleet of treasure-ships that are expected to fur- 
nish the depleted Spanish treasury. The action of 
the romance takes place for the most part upon 
Spanish soil, and concerns about equally the English 
soldier already mentioned and a young Spaniard 
who becomes his companion in arms and devoted 
friend. It afterwards transpires that the Spaniard 
is a woman in disguise. There can be only one way 
out of such a complication. The book is a good one 
of its sort, crammed with exciting episodes, and 
wrapped in the atmosphere of romance. 

Mr. McLennan's " Spanish John " is a romance 
of the Pretender and the expedition of 1745. The 
hero is a youth who is sent to Rome to be educated 
for the priesthood, but who finds soldiering much 
more to his taste, and joins the Spanish troops then 
campaigning in Italy. After some very good fight- 



ing at Velletri, he is sent to Scotland on a secret 
mission in behalf of Prince Charlie, and has so ex- 
citing a series of experiences that not until the end 
is reached do we recall, with a sort of pained sur- 
prise, the fact that we have been reading a book 
without a love-story. The style of the narrative is 
crisp and vigorous, and a remarkable power of real- 
izing the life of the period is displayed. This power 
has since been explained, we regret to say, in a way 
not creditable to the author. A contributor to " The 
Bookman " has unearthed, in a Canadian periodical 
of the early part of this century, a certain " Narra- 
tive " upon which it becomes only too evident that 
Mr. McLennan has drawn, not merely for his inci- 
dents, but for his descriptions and his very phrase- 
ology. It seems to be a clear case of pilfering, which 
is naturally bad for Mr. McLennan's reputation, 
although it does not make his book any the less 
readable and remarkable. 

The character of Henry of Navarre is rightly a 
favorite with the romantic novelist, and few periods 
of history offer material so fascinating as that which 
deals with the great struggle between Henry and 
the League. Mr. R. N. Stephens, in " An Enemy 
to the King " deals with this material once more, 
and tells, after the strictly conventional pattern, of 
a young scion of an impoverished house who starts 
out to see the world, after the fashion of Artagnan 
or Sigognac, and learns to the full the meaning of 
fierce wars and faithful loves. He gets into the 
thick of events at once, for his first day in Paris is 
marked by an encounter with Bussy d'Amboise, and 
not long thereafter he wins the favor of Marguerite, 
who helps him to escape the vengeance of Guise and 
the Queen- Mother, and despatches him to Be*arn 
with a letter to her princely consort. From this 
time on, his days are filled with exciting occurrences, 
and he permits no earlier hero of romance to outdo 
him in deeds of valor and chivalry. It is the sort 
of story that we have read many times before, and 
is quite as good as the similar inventions of Mr. 
Weyman and his confreres. We welcome Mr. Ste- 
phens to the ranks of our entertainers in this sort, 
and hope to hear from him again. 

" For Prince and People," by Mr. E. K. Sanders, 
is a story of old Genoa and the tyranny of the Doria. 
The conspiracy of Fieschi is the real subject of the 
narrative, and the treatment given it follows closely 
the lines laid down by the early romantic drama of 
Schiller. The book is not particularly noteworthy, 
but it is a painstaking piece of workmanship, and 
we have read it with a certain degree of satitsf action. 

American novelists are learning to draw more 
and more upon the store of romantic material pro- 
vided by our own annals, and the work of historical 
societies and other organizations for the preservation 
and publication of what bibliographers call Ameri- 
cana is bearing abundant fruit in the form of his- 
torical fiction. In " Vivian of Virginia," Mr. Hul- 
bert Fuller tells of Bacon's Rebellion, and draws 
full-length portraits of that popular leader as well 
as of his grim antagonist, Governor Berkeley, whose

hatred of schools and printing, expressed in a fre- 
quently-quoted passage, has preserved his memory 
better than all the acts of the years when, " drest 
in a little brief authority," he played the petty despot 
in his Colony. The hero of the romance is a soldier 
who has been fighting under Churchill in Flanders, 
and now, thrown on the world without employment, 
welcomes an opportunity to embark for the planta- 
tions, and cast in his lot with the Virginians. The 
story of his share in Bacon's Rebellion, and of his 
conquest of the fair and high-spirited maiden who 
engages his affections, is told in the regulation 
manner, and to much the effect of the countless sim- 
ilar romances dealing with old-world themes that 
have come to our attention during the past ten years. 
It is a pretty tale, and has a considerable historical 
interest as well. 

Miss Rayner's " Free to Serve " takes us some- 
what out of the beaten track in historical fiction, being 
the story of a well-born English girl who, through 
the contemptible conduct of a worthless brother, is 
brought to America to be sold in New York as a bond- 
servant. Her services are purchased by a substantial 
Dutch burgher, whose manorial estate far up the 
Hudson is the scene of the greater part of the ro- 
mance, and whose two sons become rivals for the 
love of the young woman who by so fortunate a 
circumstance falls in their way. The book is a long 
one, packed with incident, and made of unusual 
value by its strong delineation of the several char- 
acters concerned, as well as by its vivid presentation 
of the condition of life in the Colony of New York. 
The time of action is set at the very beginning of 
the eighteenth century. 

The story of " King Washington " is based upon 
an episode in the life of our first President during 
the period that followed the surrender at Yorktown, 
when Clinton was still in command in New York, 
and Washington was keeping watch at Newburgh. 
This romance weaves together into a well-constructed 
narrative the historical incident of the Nicola letter, 
with its insulting suggestion that the American 
leader should assume the royal title, and an imag- 
inary plot, instigated by Prescott, to kidnap him 
and deliver him up to the British army. The active 
agent in this plot is a woman of mixed French and 
Indian blood, disguised as a boy, whom Prescott has 
promised to make his wife should the conspiracy 
prove successful. Under the name of Louis Paschal 
this woman gains the confidence of Washington and 
his circle, the plot failing of success only by acci- 
dent at the critical juncture. A pretty love-story, 
concerning a blunt straightforward American officer 
and the charming daughter of one of the conspira- 
tors, lends an additional touch of romantic interest 
to the situation. The story is very well worked out, 
with much effective use of antiquarian material, and 
illustrated by photographs of the scenes and historic 
houses which come within the scope of the work. 

The Archdeacon of Pennsylvania has written a 
stirring " story of land and sea in the days of the 
Revolution " the American Revolution, that is 



and entitled it " For Love of Country." There is 
some good sea-fighting under Paul Jones and other 
commanders, a graphic description of the crossing 
of the Delaware and the subsequent campaign of 
Trenton and Princeton, and the inevitable love-story 
with its inevitably happy ending. Historically, the 
author knows whereof he writes, and has taken no 
unwarrantable liberties with the facts. His sea- 
pictures are especially well done, which is a not 
unnatural consequence of the author's early training 
in the naval service of the United States. Alto- 
gether, the book is clean, wholesome, and spirited, 
and deserves well of the public. 

" Chalmette," by Mr. Clinton Ross, is a romance 
of the days and events leading up to the Battle of 
New Orleans. Its hero is a young Virginian officer 
under Jackson's leadership, and the plot is chiefly 
concerned with Lafitte and his nest of Baratarian 
pirates who prove an effective factor in the further- 
ing of the American cause. The manner of narra- 
tion is jerky and episodical, making the drift of the 
work somewhat difficult to catch, a defect partly 
atoned for by the bits of vivid dramatic action oc- 
curring now and then. One cannot help feeling that 
Mr. Ross is better qualified to write for the stage 
than for the reading public, and that his work adds 
to its natural demands upon the ear an unwonted 
demand upon the imaginative eye of the observer.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Mr. John M. Robertson, in his " New 
Outlines of a new Essays toward a Critical Method" 

critical method. J . 

(Lane) makes a suggestive and val- 
uable contribution to critical literature, although the 
outlines of the " general critical method " which he 
claims to have developed are not very easy to trace. 
These outlines are to be looked for mainly in the 
introductory chapter on " The Theory and Practice 
of Criticism," since the special chapters that follow 
are admitted to antedate by ten years or more the 
complete formulation of the writer's critical system. 
Mr. Robertson is distinctly wedded to the view that 
criticism may be raised to the scientific plane, 
wherein he has our hearty approval, and his con- 
demnation of the subjective and impressionist writ- 
ing that passes for criticism is well-considered and 
well-stated, although it amounts in ,our opinion to 
little more than slaying the slain. His observations, 
also, concerning his predecessors among the practi- 
tioners of scientific criticism are acute and logical. 
He not only pays his respects to such well-known 
men as Sainte-Beuve and Taine and Brunetiere, but 
also calls our attention to less familiar discussions 
of critical technique by Hennequin and Droz and 
E. S. Dallas. But when we seek the formulation 
of his own ideas, we find little beyond a modified 
acceptance of Taine's fundamental principles coupled 
with suggestions traceable to Sainte-Beuve and 



1898.]

Hennequin, and supplemented by an insistence upon 
the primary necessity that the critic should allow 
for his own personal equation. It is under this latter 
head that the author says his best things, and every 
critic who takes his business seriously would do well 
to mark and inwardly digest the following passage : 
' As regards his limitations and his antipathies he 
can only partially take precaution, and this only by 
a kind of discipline which few are ready to practice. 
In sum, it consists in carefully studying all the cases 
of wide appreciation in which he cannot feel with 
the many, and carefully estimating the calibre of the 
judgments with which he cannot agree. Suppose it be 
that he does not readily enjoy or admire Cervantes, 
or Calderon, or Schiller, or Hugo, or Browning, or 
Dickens, or Tolstoi, each of whom has won very 
high, and some very general, praise, to ask himself 
narrowly whether he has missed the excellences on 
which it dwells, to consider the training, the bias, 
the cast of mind of those who bestow it, and then, 
if he thinks he fairly can, to explain it in terms of 
the prejudice, or limitation, or deficient culture of 
the admirers ; or, if he cannot, to seek objectively 
for the merits which delight them, and to note them 
as forms of effect to which he is but slightly sus- 
ceptible." It is this method of collation and diag- 
nosis of expert opinion that Mr. Robertson would 
have the critic pursue, and an application of this 
method (although imperfect for the reason above 
stated) is what we find in the essays on Poe, Cole- 
ridge, Shelley, Keats, Burns, and Clough, that fill 
out his volume. We by no means agree with all 
of the conclusions reached concerning these poets, 
and think that their unsoundness might in not a few 
instances be traced to a lack of the very method 
which Mr. Robertson admits was not framed until 
after their formulation, but there is not space to 
pursue this inquiry into detail. We think that a 
grave injustice is done Mr. Stedman in saying that, 
in his work done for the definitive edition of Poe, 
he " passed from his older attitude of sympathy to 
that of a pseudo-judical animus." It is to Professor 
Woodberry that this animus must be attributed 
rather than to his senior colleague. And we mark 
a discrepancy that calls for correction in two notes 
upon the untimely death of Hennequin. One of them 
informs us that he died in the summer of 1888, the 
other in the spring of 1889. 



A pleasant 
narrative, 
but not history. 



The day is happily past when pleas- 
antly-written narrative, with little 
regard to accuracy of facts, could 
pass as history. The writer who, when taken to 
task for the errors of his work, pompously replied, 
" So much the worse for the facts," has been super- 
seded in public estimation. Miss Edith Sichel, au- 
thor of " The Household of the Lafayettes " (Mac- 
millan), might succeed better as a writer of romance 
than of history. She has imagination and an enter- 
taining style, but her work cannot meet the funda- 
mental requirement of a history accuracy as to 



facts. How much faith can be put in the story of 
the Lafayette family, as told by a writer who erra 
grievously regarding the most important facts of 
the revolutionary history of France? To enumer- 
ate briefly : Miss Sichel would find it hard to name 
any French Republicans of 1788 (p. 100) ; Bar- 
nave was not a Girondist ; Mirabeau was not the 
one to christen the States General the National 
Assembly (p. 107) ; Talleyrand was a bishop, not 
an abbot ( p. 113) ; Mirabeau was not " a democrat 
among democrats from May until the end of Octo- 
ber," 1789, nor did he " proclaim the necessity of 
restoring an executive" (p. 118) only after that 
time : he was consistently in favor of a strong ex- 
ecutive. The author knows next to nothing of 
political grouping or the nature of the Terror gov- 
ernment. The Girondist party was not a party of 
the National Assembly (p. 133 ) ; the Committee 
of Public Safety did not exist as early as the autumn 
of 1792 (p. 162) ; the Revolutionary tribunal was 
established prior to the Committee of Public Safety, 
and not after it (p. 179) ; the Convention did not 
proscribe the Catholic faith (p. 193) : that was the 
work of the commune ; England did not declare war 
on France in 1792 (p. 194), but France declared 
war on England ; the Dantonists were not executed 
"at the close of the month" (March, 1794), as 
stated (p. 195), but on April 6 ; Napoleon was not 
recalled from Egypt by a secret letter, but, in the 
exchange of prisoners between him and Sir Sidney 
Smith, the English commander, some French news- 
papers fell into his hands, which apprised him of 
the political condition in France ; Pichegru was not 
beheaded (p. 296), but was strangled. These are 
positive errors of fact. Examples of unripe judg- 
ment and childish enthusiasm abound. One might 
know very nearly what to expect of a writer who 
introduces her book by such a statement as this : 
" Angels are few and far between. It is almost 
incredible to find a whole band of them, especially 
a band living together and tied to each other by 
blood. Yet this improbable conception is realized 
by the De Noailles" (p. 27). If it were not so 
pitiable, we might laugh at the assertion that Corn- 
wallis was " at last forced into Yorktown by the skill 
of Lafayette " (p. 75) ; that the French Bill of 
Rights was similar to the English Petition of Rights ; 
that Lafayette was a "hero of chivalry" in the 
events of the 5th and 6th of October, 1789 ; that 
Mirabeau was jealous of Lafayette a statement 
which reminds one of the fable of the ox and the 
fly. Lesser errors here and there throughout the 
book betray the fact that the author has little knowl- 
edge of the institutions of the times she has at- 
tempted to portray. She uses the word " intendant " 
when "bailiff" is meant (p. 7) ; she speaks of the 
jeunesse doree before 1789, although a knowledge 
of the Revolution ought to have taught her that that 
term has a special historical significance (p. 7) ; she 
speaks of the Parlements of Paris, and even, En- 
glish as she is, talks of the Petition of Rights. But

it were ungracious to continue criticism of a book 
whose errors glare at us from every page ; and even 
the vivacity of the style and the numerous anecdotes

A noteworthy No evidence of the insufficiency of 
contribution to the average medical school in this 
medical literature. country { s so convincing as the char- 
acter of the medical literature put forth. American 
medical journals are almost as numerous as the 
leaves on the trees, and of medical books we produce 
a plenty ; but he is a bold man who will presume to 
find in this mass of literature the patient study of 
cases, the scientific accuracy of statement, and the 
wide range of observation, that characterize the best 
foreign medical literature. In " Operative Gyne- 
cology," of which Volume I. has just been issued 
from the press of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co., Dr. 
Howard A. Kelly, of the Johns Hopkins University, 
has taken a long stride ahead. He has produced a 
book in surgical gynecology that will take rank at 
once in this specialty with the work of Schroder, 
Martin, Zweifel, and Veit, in Germany ; of Pozzi 
and Pe*an, in France ; and of Sir Spencer Wells, in 
England. Dr. Kelly is still a young man, but he 
has already achieved an international reputation, 
and the originality of his book tells why. It is the 
record of the author's own practice, showing on every 
page not only a quick and keen observation of facts, 
but that ability to discriminate, to sift, and to select, 
which is the true scientific spirit. The record covers 
an experience of eighteen years, during the last nine 
of which Dr. Kelly has been gynecologist-in-chief to 
the Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore. What 
is especially pleasing in this latest production of the 
Johns Hopkins Medical School is its conservative 
tone. It is the day of gynecology. Allured by the 
prospects of quick rewards in fame and money, 
young men of all degrees of shortcoming in medical 
training and experience, and of all sorts of moral 
consciousness, are rushing into this specialty. It 
has become the by-word of the medical profession 
that too many of them are only too ready to operate. 
We believe that the comparative safety of abdominal 
surgery which has been brought about by the knowl- 
edge of asepsis in modern surgical technique is a 
great boon to suffering women, but we have no 
hesitation in saying that operative gynecology is 
carried too far everywhere. It is often a meddle- 
some interference, based upon ignorance of natural 
conditions, and wholly mischievous in its moral con- 
sequences. We hope and trust that the conservative 
and conscientious attitude of so distinguished a 
gynecologist as Dr. Kelly will stay the tide of ex- 
sective operations on women. The illustrations of 
this book are superb. There are more than six 
hundred of them, all original ; surely no medical 
work, certainly no American medical work, has ever 
before been so finely illustrated. The chapter on 
the topographical anatomy of the abdomen, which 
is simply a clear description of a series of beautiful

literature. 



pictures, is a revelation as to what art can do to 
illuminate surgery. No surgeon can hereafter afford 
to be ignorant of this admirable piece of work. The 
execution of the book throughout reflects honor upon 
American printing, and the publishers are to be con- 
gratulated upon an imprint which is at least as per- 
fect as care and skill and taste can produce. Each 
volume (Volume II. will appear very shortly) is 
separately indexed, in five sections, an index of 
plates, of illustrations, of cases from the literature, 
of cases from the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and a 
general index. 

" The Later Renaissance," by Mr. 
David Hannay, is a volume in the 
series called " Periods of European 
Literature " (Scribner). It is the second to be pub- 
lished, but stands sixth in the chronological order. 
It is chiefly concerned with the literatures of England 
and Spain, although short chapters are devoted to 
those of France and Italy. In the case of Spain, 
the author has practically dealt with the whole of 
the great age of Spanish literature, overlapping in 
both directions the period assigned to him. The 
importance of thus treating Spanish literature as a 
whole seemed to outweigh the reasons for dividing 
it up among three or four volumes by different hands. 
" Spain suspended the anarchy of her middle ages 
at the end of the fifteenth century, gathered force, 
burst upon the world with the violence of a Turkish 
invasion, flourished for a space, and then sank ex- 
hausted at the end of a hundred and fifty years." 
The literary manifestations of this energy were no 
less remarkable than the others, and the intellectual 
movement as a whole has a unity that demands con- 
tinuous treatment. Still, the reasons for treating as 
a whole the English drama of the Elizabethan and 
Jacobean periods are no less cogent ; yet the volume 
before us breaks off with Shakespeare, leaving most 
of his great contemporaries to be taken up in another 
work and by another writer. Mr. Hannay is at his 
best in dealing with the literature of Spain, and his 
treatment of the other literatures of the time (even 
the English ) seems perfunctory in comparison. Cer- 
tain defects of sympathy appear now and then, as 
in the estimate of such men as Camoens and Gra- 
cian ; but the book as a whole offers an exhibition 
of temperate judgment and reasonably attractive 
presentation. 

Some criticism, A little book on the "Elements of 
literary and Literary Criticism" (Harper), by 

otherwise. Mr Charles F. Johnson, may be 

recommended to young readers (and some older 
ones) as a readable, and in the main trustworthy, 
analysis of the elements that make up good litera- 
ture and as a guide to the acquisition of correct 
taste. The author subdivides his theme, after a 
preliminary discussion of the principle of unity in 
literary composition, into the special topics of char- 
acterization, philosophy, and the musical, phrasal, 
descriptive, and emotional powers. There is much 
good sense in what he says upon these subjects, and

much apposite illustration of his several propositions. 
The book is marred now and then by a critical judg- 
ment that is not easily defensible, as when it is 
suggested that Hugo and Tolstoi may possibly be 
ranked with the great " illuminated intellects " of 
literature, with Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe ; 
or when Byron is called a " magnificent artist," 
which is precisely what Byron was not. Nor does 
one often in a good book come across so misleading 
and unfair a characterization as that of Rossetti, 
described as " a man who believes that the world of 
Dante's day is preferable to the world of to-day, 
who has apparently never heard of the discovery of 
the conservation of energy nor of the main outlines 
of evolution, and who thinks the form of a chair or 
the pattern of a brocade more important and inter- 
esting than the struggle of humanity towards higher 
things." Such a passage as this is a solemn warn- 
ing of the dangers that attend the cultivation of 
rhetoric without knowledge. 



A loving 
memorial to 
Miss Rottttli. 



The "biographical and critical study" 
of Christina Rossetti which we owe 
to the sympathetic and industrious 
labors of Mr. Mackenzie Bell makes a sizable vol- 
ume of over four hundred pages (Roberts), illus- 
trated with portraits and facsimiles of the greatest 
interest, and supplied with a bibliography by Mr. 
J. P. Anderson of the British Museum. We have 
no doubt that the preparation of this book has been 
to the author, as he says, a " peculiar pleasure," and 
that he has spared no pains to make it an accurate 
presentation of the noble woman and great poet to 
whose memory it is dedicated. Loving care and 
sympathy are evident upon every page, as well as 
a degree of scrupulousness in the statement of exact 
fact that verges upon pedantry. We wish that we 
might go beyond this tribute of respect, and com- 
mend the volume as a piece of good writing and 
adequate criticism ; but this is frankly impossible. 
The limitations of the writer, both as critic and 
biographer, are too painfully apparent to permit of 
such praise, and it must be said that his portrait 
bears about the same relation to the portrait which 
we hope sometime to possess of Christina Rossetti 
that is borne by a Denner to a Rembrandt. The 
markings are all given with photographic accuracy, 
but the character is somehow missing. Neverthe- 
less, the book is welcome, and we could not well dis- 
pense with it, although it does little to assist us in 
comprehension of the rare and beautiful spirit ex- 
haled from these poems that constitute one of the 
chief glories of our Victorian literature. 



A true primer 
of psychology. 



Text-books, like other things, are 
liable to the charge of being seldom 
(or at least not so frequently as is 
desirable) what they seem. Many a primer is sim- 
ply a congested mass of facts, in which terseness or 
inaccuracy increases difficulties with no other com- 
pensation than a decrease in the number of pages. 
Professor Titchener's " Primer of Psychology " 



McCarthy''* 
" French 
Revolution.^ 



( Macmillan) offers a bright contrast to this not un- 
common type. It is a true primer, or first book, of 
psychology, and is well fitted to make these first 
steps attractive to earnest students. It does not 
pretend to be a royal road to learning, but counts 
upon the increase of interest as well of ability which 
comes only from continued effort ; but it directs that 
effort wisely and well. It is broad in treatment, 
covering a large part of the domain of modern psy- 
chology ; but it covers it in a way suitable to the 
beginner's understanding. It utilizes the daily ex- 
periences of our mental life ; supplements these by 
the more direct and forcible results of experimen- 
tation, and further imbues them with living interest 
by the introduction of evolutionary, of social, and of 
literary illustrations. It is true that it reflects as well 
the unsettled condition of many questions in psy- 
chology; and the reader is honestly made aware 
of the fact that he is frequently reading the views 
of Professor Titchener rather than a consensus of 
psychological opinion. But this is inevitable, and 
does little harm. In brief, the work combines so 
many of the possible virtues of a primer, and avoids 
so many of the much larger number of possible vices, 
that it may be most cordially recommended as an 
unusually able and practical beginner's book in psy- 
chology. 

The second and concluding volume 
of Mr. Justin McCarthy's " French 
Revolution" (Harper) opens with 
the events immediately succeeding the Fall of the 
Bastile and ends with the close of the Constituent 
Assembly. The events of this period are given in 
an orderly narration, and though there is a tendency 
to drag in unimportant details, the author, in his 
accustomed journalistic style, has drawn a vivid 
picture of the times. Two chapters, one on the news- 
papers of the period and one on the more important 
clubs, give interesting information not generally 
found in short histories of the French Revolution. 
The treatment of the character and influence of 
Marie Antoinette, while fully recognizing those 
qualities which made her so unpopular, is distinctly 
sympathetic, especial emphasis being placed upon 
her courage in the time of danger. An excellent 
index, to both volumes, is given. 

Students and teachers of comparative 
and of human anatomy will find much 
to approve in Professor Jayne's " The 
Skeleton of the Cat," the first to appear of a series 
on " Mammalian Anatomy " (Lippincott), designed 
as a preparation for study in these two fields. This 
monograph opens with a chapter devoted to defini- 
tions and methods, and is followed by a systematic 
study of every bone and of the regions formed by 
union. The description of a bone includes an ex- 
planation of its name, the areas for muscular attach- 
ment, its articulation, rules for rapid identification, 
the centres of ossification from which it is developed, 
its growth, and its variations. A careful comparison

is then made with the corresponding hone in the 
human skeleton. The derivation of technical names 
is given, along with the English derivations and 
French and German equivalents. The simple and 
practical terminology, the clear presentation and 
logical arrangement of the subject, and the abund- 
ant illustrations, make the hook a satisfactory and 
practicable guide for the novice, while its wealth of 
detail affords a veritable mine of information for 
the teacher. The book is a credit to American schol- 
arship and American bookmaking, and is destined 
to a real field of usefulness in the biological labora- 
tory and in the service of the independent worker. 

Beginning* of life The volume entitled Relics of Pri- 
and foundations meval Life " (Fleming H. Revell Co.) 
of continent*. contains the substance of a course of 
lectures before the Lowell Institute of Boston, by 
Sir J. William Dawson. The lectures treat an ob- 
scure subject, the records of which have been in 
great measure obliterated by metamorphic influences 
operative in geologic periods of undeterminable dur- 
ation. In the great geologic stone book, these records 
were inscribed upon the eldest leaves, forming that 
strip of present land in Eastern Canada, by the 
St. Lawrence River, which first emerged from the 
shoreless ocean, at least in the Western hemisphere. 
Here life began at the bottom of a most ancient sea. 
Before other deposits were piled upon them, these 
strata were lifted above the waves and stratigraphic 
records cease. The EozoOn, the dawn animal, ap- 
pears to have been among the first of the living 
things which were introduced into the waters that 
covered the earth, after its more active physical 
transformations were finished. It appears to have 
come in upon the ground floor. It is something to 
have determined, even approximately, the begin- 
nings of life and the foundations of continents. 



An excellent 

American 

history. 



The ideal history of the United 
States for schools has probably not 
been written ; but perhaps the nearest 
approach to that ideal is at hand in the " Students' 
History of the United States," written by Professor 
Edward Channing of Harvard University, and pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co. Those who read Pro- 
fessor Channing's smaller volume, prepared two 
years or more ago to meet the needs of English stu- 
dents of American history, must welcome this latest 
contribution with interest. There is the proper pro- 
portion, no one period being unduly magnified at 
the expense of another ; the suggestions and refer- 
ences are exceedingly helpful ; the illustrative mate- 
rial is well selected, and the several chapters are so 
admirably constructed as to make the book appeal 
at once to teachers as the best of its kind that has 
yet appeared. 

One of the most important episodes 
in the earl J history of New England 
was the war of extermination waged 
against the fierce tribe of Pequot Indians, which 
threatened the quiet and security of the border lands 



toward which the overflow of the Bay population 
was rushing. So complete was the work of the 
whites, when once they had bestirred themselves 
against the savages, that the Pequots were almost 
entirely destroyed, after which " the land had rest 
for forty years." A good service for students of 
American history has been done by Mr. Charles Orr 
in reprinting in a neat volume (Cleveland : Helman- 
Taylor Co.) the accounts of this war, written by par- 
ticipants in it, which have been preserved in perma- 
nent form in the collections of the Massachusetts 
Historical Society. The story, as told by Major John 
Mason, Captain John Underbill, Captain Lion Gar- 
dener, and Mr. Philip Vincent, is illustrated by an 
introduction, by foot-notes, and by a map, thus 
putting in convenient form for reference material 
heretofore locked up in comparatively inaccessible 
volumes. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The latest number of the Johns Hopkins University 
Studies consists of some two hundred pages on " The 
Neutrality of the American Lakes," by Mr. James Mor- 
ton Callahan. The author finds the comity between 
Canada and the United States for eighty years under the 
agreement of joint occupation to be unique, a precedent 
worthy of imitation, and a strong argument for " peace 
establishments." 

" The Best of Browning," by the Rev. James Mudge, 
is a publication of Messrs. Eaton & Mains. It opens 
with an introduction by the Rev. William V. Kelley, 
which is followed by an " explanatory " section by the 
editor. Then we have in succession " How to Read 
Browning," " The Benefits of Browning Study," " Brief 
Felicities and Fancies," " Moral and Religious Thoughts," 
and " Gems of Description." Finally, when half through 
the volume, we come to the selected poems themselves, 
although even here we are not spared a great deal of 
comment and annotation. One is apt to think " the 
worst of Browning " is that it takes so much apparatus 
to explain " the best " of him, but we would not deride 
a book that has been so lovingly put together, and that 
may prove just the thing needed by readers who would 
not get Browning at all save in some such guise. 

It is seldom that one sees handsomer specimens of 
bookmaking than the volumes issued in " The Tudor 
Translations," a series edited by Mr. W. E. Henley and 
published by Mr. David Nutt of London. The object of 
this series is to reproduce the " acknowledged master- 
pieces of English style in the one hundred years from 
1550 to 1650, which are also masterpieces of Classic 
and European literature." Florio's Montaigne, North's 
Plutarch, and Shelton's Don Quixote are among the 
works already issued, the latest to appear being Geffraie 
Fenton's translation of the " Tragicall Discourses " of 
Matteo Bandello, in two volumes, with a lengthy Intro- 
duction by Mr. Robert Langton Douglas. The Eliza- 
bethan dramatists owe much to these quaintly-written 
love tales of Bandello, the material of such plays as 
"Romeo and Juliet," "Twelfth Night," and "The 
Duchess of Malfy " being directly referable to the 
" Discourses." It was altogether well worth while to 
reprint the work in this sumptuous series.

LITERARY NOTES. 



" The Psalms," in two volumes, edited by Professor 
R. G. Moulton, are published by the Macmillan Co. in 
" The Modern Reader's Bible." 

A new edition of Dr. Th. Billroth's " The Care of the 
Sick," translated by Mr. J. Bentall Endean, is published 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The Macmillan Co. publish The Cathedral Church 
of Hereford," by Mr. A. Hugh Fisher, in the " Cathe- 
dral " series of handbooks edited by Mr. Gleeson White. 
" Wonder Tales from Wagner," told for young people 
by Miss Anna Alice Chapin, is a companion volume to 
her " Story of the Rhinegold," and is published by 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are soon to publish Dau- 
det's " Soutien de Famille " in an English translation 
entitled " The Head of the Family," with an introduc- 
tion by Professor Adolphe Cohn. 

" Religious Pamphlets," selected and edited by the 
Rev. Percy Dearmer, is published in the "Pamphlet 
Library" by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. There are 
seventeen numbers, ranging from Wiclif to Newman. 
" To Teach the Negro History " is the title of a pam- 
phlet by Mr. John Stephens Durham, published by Mr. 
David McKay. It is a condensation of a series of talks 
given by the author a year ago at the Hampton and 
Tuskegee schools. 

The Chinese library of the late James Legge has been 
purchased by Messrs. Luzac & Co. of London, who will 
soon issue a catalogue of the collection. There are be- 
tween two and three thousand volumes, and a sale en 
bloc to some institution is desired to be made by the 
owners. 

The " Saturday Evening Post " of Philadelphia, the 
oldest paper in America, has been purchased by the Cur- 
tis Publishing Co., and will be run hereafter as a weekly 
magazine. The " Post " was originally the old " Penn- 
sylvania Gazette," conducted by Benjamin Franklin. 

Messrs. Luzac & Co., London, publish Dr. Fritz 
Rosen's " Modern Persian Colloquial Grammar," with 
dialogues for easy reading, and selections from the 
diaries of the late Shah. The reading matter is given 
in threefold form, Persian script, roman transliteration, 
and English translation. 

" The Poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge " is a vol- 
ume in " The Muse's Library," imported by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. The special significance of 
this edition is due to the fact that it is edited by Dr. 
Richard Garnett, whose lengthy introduction is a con- 
tribution of fresh and lasting value to poetical criticism. 
" Chinese Philosophy," by Dr. Paul Carus, being " an 
exposition of the main characteristic features of Chinese 
thought," is issued in " The Religion of Science Library " 
by the Open Court Publishing Co. A prefatory note 
informs us that the work has been translated into Chinese 
by order of the Tsungli Yamen, and placed on file in the 
official archives. 

A rival to the new Bible dictionary now in course of 
publication by the Messrs. Scribner will be offered by 
the " Encyclopaedia Biblica," now announced by the Mac- 
millan Co. This work will extend to four volumes, to 
appear quarterly, beginning with next October. Dr. 
T. K. Cheyne is the chief editor of this work, which has 
the collaboration of the most eminent scholars of Europe 
and America. 

Recently published classical texts include "Ovid: 



Metamorphoses, Book XIII." (Hinds & Noble), edited 
by Mr. J. H. Hayden ; Xenophon's " Cyropsedia " 
(American Book Co.), edited and abridged by Mr. C. W. 
Gleason; "The First Book of Caesar's Gallic War" 
(Ginn), edited by Dr. A. W. Roberts; and "The Cap- 
tivis and Trinummus of Plautus " (Ginn), edited by

Drake and the Tudor Navy. 

With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power. 

By JULIAN S. COBBETT. With portrait, 24 plates (8 charts), 

and 14 illustrations in the text (6 charts). 2 vols., large 

8vo, 948 pages, cloth extra, $10.00. 

In the present work an attempt is made to give a general view of the 
circumstances under which England first became a controlling force in 
the European system by virtue of her power upon the sea. . . . Not only 
was Drake intimately connected, in all the various phases of his life, with 
every aspect of the Elizabethan maritime upheaval, but throughout 
Europe he was recognized and applauded, even in his lifetime, as the 
personification of the new political force. . . . The romantic fascination 
of his career as a corsair and explorer began, it is true, very shortly after 
his death to overshadow his work as an admiral and a statesman, but in 
his own time it was not so ; and a principal object of the present work 
is to restore him to the position he once held as one of the great military 
figures of the Reformation. 

A Memoir of Major = General Sir Henry 
Creswicke Rawlinson, Bart. 

By GEORGE RAWLINSON, M.A., F.R.G.S., Canon of Canter- 
bury, late Camden Professor of Ancient History in the Uni- 
versity of Oxford. With an Introduction by Field-Marshal 
Lord ROBERTS of Kandahar, V.C. With portraits, illustra- 
tions, and map. Large 8vo, $5.00. 

The Story of the Malakand Field Force, 

1897. 
An Episode of Frontier Warfare. 

By WINSTON L. SPENCER CHURCHILL. With 6 maps and 

plans and a frontispiece portrait of Major-General Sir 

BINDON BLOOD, E.C.B. Crown 8vo, 350 pages, $2.50. 

The author of this volume is the eldest son of the late Lord Randolph 

Churchill. He is a lieutenant of the 4th (Queen's Own) Hussars, and 

got leave to accompany the Malakand Expedition. Mr. Churchill had 

before seen something of warfare in Cuba, when Marshal Campos was 

in command there. He has enjoyed the distinction of being mentioned 

in dispatches during the Frontier Campaign, although only present in 

the capacity of correspondent. 

Library of 
Historical Novels and Romances. 

Edited by GEORGE LAURENCE GOMME. 

" The editor . . . proposes to cover the growth of English history 
pretty thoroughly in this series, and ... he so annotates and illus- 
trates each of his books that they take on an instructive character un- 
usual for fiction. . . . The plan is a good one, Mr. Gomme handles it 
with all possible cleverness, and the publishers have attended to the 
illustrations and general make-up of the books with a good taste and 
thoroughness that leave nothing to be desired." A>ir York Tribune.

Weeping Ferry, and Other Stories. 

By MARGARET L. WOODS, author of "A Village Tragedy," 

etc. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

" The story of ' Weeping Ferry * is tragic enough and uncommonly 
well told, full of fire and pathos. Miss Woods is by no means the usual 
type of story-writer, but has a touch of genius. The initial story is not 
properly a short story, but the other sketches in the volume are, and 
are good, though not so striking as the longer one." Springfield 
Republican.

MR. FRANK R. STOCKTON'S NEW LOVE STORY. 

" His name alone carries a laugh with it." The Dial. 

THE GIRL AT COBHURST. 

I2mo, $1.50. 

" This has at the start a certain distinction, and piques curiosity, in being the only one of Mr. Stockton's books that has not had prior 
publication as a magazine serial. The ' girl ' of the tale is left somewhat unidentified in the tale itself, there being several of her, and the 
possibility remaining that she is none other than a certain miraculous French cook in other words, the 'girl ' in the sense of the American

demure humor." New York Evening Pott. 

" With every new book from Mr. Stockton's pen we are reminded of the great Johann Kreutzer's classification of Trilby as a singer : ' Zere 
are two classes of beoble who sing. In ze von class, la Spencali ; in ze ozzer all ze ozzer zingers.' So with Mr. Stockton as a ' Romancier.' 
In the one class Mr. Stockton ; in the other all the other tellers of stories. ' The Girl at Cobhurst ' is delightfully Stocktonian, just a* unique, 
as fresh, as original as if Mr. Stockton had never done anything else in a similar vein. ... It is a distinct literary boon, as fresh and pure and 
bright as all that has come from the same source." Xew York Time*.

ON COMEDY. 

One cause of the decline of comedy is the squeam- 
ishness of modern manners, which will not permit 
as to present things in their actuality, hut requires 
a decent veil of words thrown over character and 
incident. A novel may hint at an occurrence, or 
describe it by periphrasis, or by its effect ; but in 
comedy the thing itself must happen visibly. A 
novel can write all around a character describe 
his manners and conversation and walk ; a comedy 
must set him up on two legs and let him introduce 
himself. If a character is brutal or vulgar or un- 
seemly, all this must come out in comedy ; in a novel 
it can be glossed over. Nay, more : in a comedy 
the whole character has to be concentrated into a 
few speeches. It is necessary, therefore, for it to 
exaggerate all saliencies, and to give in one brief 
display all the characteristics which a human being 
would exhibit in a lifetime. And as comedy finds 
its subjects among the lighter follies and vices of 
mankind, this essential extract is found too strong 
for modern taste. 

If the aim of tragedy is to produce pleasure by 
the display of great forces warring against restraint, 
the business of comedy is to give happiness by the 
show of unfettered freedom. It is like the Roman 
Saturnalia, and in it we slaves of nature or of each 
other may fling our chains away and flout our mas- 
ters and defy our fate. The comedy of Aristophanes 
turns the world upside down, sets low what is high 
and high what is low. The comedy of Menander, 
Terence and Plautus mocks all the settled order and 
proverbial wisdom of life. It apotheosizes the spend- 
thrift and the thievish servant and the girl of easy 
virtue. Goldsmith and Sheridan make animal spirits 
and a happy-go-lucky disposition the choicest gifts 
of Fate. At Moliere's command all men drop their 
masks, and their pretensions and solemn absurdities 
shrivel in his flickering smile. Shakespeare alone, 
from the dark materials of the earth, builds a place 
of refuge and escape, reveals the vision of a 
sweeter, merrier world. All alike, however, free us 
momentarily from our pain and ennui. 

Society is perpetually in danger of being stiffened 
by formulas, dulled with wisdom, made vile by virtue 
or cruel by common-sense. One good custom can 
corrupt a world. It is a healthy instinct, therefore, 
which in all times and among all races has allowed 
the greatest license to the jester. He has to wear 
his cap and bells, and submit to humiliations ; but 
these accepted, he may say what he pleases. It 
seems, though I believe it is an obscure point, that 
there were some penalties attached to the acceptance 
of a comic chorus on the Athenian stage. Aristo-

phanes brought out his first two plays under an as- 
sumed name, and hesitated before coming forward 
under his own. Once he undertook the business, 
however, he was immune from consequences. The 
very notion of comedy, therefore, is license. To 
attempt to make it decent and decorous is to wrest 
it from its purpose. 

Charles Lamb's defense of the Comedians of the 
Restoration is entirely just, though he hardly took 
the most logical ground. Congreve and his success- 
ors were within their rights. The vices they satir- 
ized existed in shameless abandon, and their gay 
and good-humored presentation of them probably 
did more good than a legal indictment and a hang- 
ing judge. Thackeray, in one of the most amazing 
pieces of criticism ever penned, dismisses Congreve 
with angry scorn. The sordid world of Thackeray 
is to my mind more horrible than the lewd world of 
Congreve. Congreve's is at least gay and brilliant, 
while Thackeray's includes all that is bad in the 
older one, and has depths of squalid abasement of 
soul which Congreve could not have conceived. It 
does not mend matters that the novelist pops now 
and then upon the scene to read a lesson to us on 
his misguided creations. He only spoils the illusion 
thereby, and does not redeem the impression. I 
think it is hardly disputable that a young man or 
woman, unused to life or literature, would get a 
worse opinion of humanity from Thackeray than 
from Congreve. I do not object to Thackeray. He 
was right to paint what he saw, but he had no call 
to speak with contempt of a man who was his master 
in almost every respect. Of course, as is the case 
in Wycherly, a comic writer may mistake brutality 
and filth for wit and fun, but when Wycherly is 
brutal he ceases to be comic. The display of naked- 
ness, except with the excuse of passion or beauty or 
humor, is a crime ; and sniggering suggestiveness is 
an unpardonable sin. 

Why, indeed, should we make fish of one com- 
mandment and fowl of another ? " Thou shalt not 
covet thy neighbor's goods " is a canon, as well as 
" Thou shalt not commit adultery." Nobody ob- 
jected to Moliere's Avare, but when he brought out 
his " School for Wives " all Paris stuffed its fingers 
in its ears. Love is the universal theme. It is the 
salt which keeps literature fresh. Comedy cannot 
do without it, but must treat it in the comic spirit. 
It has its lofty heights in " Romeo and Juliet " or 
" Tristan and Isolde," and it has its ludicrous depths 
in " The Merry Wives of Windsor " or " Tristram 
Shandy." It is, in fact, too strong a passion to allow 
to rage unlaughed at. As has been said, there is 
nothing so serious as lust. Treat the passion always 
en fiaut, and there would be no living in the world. 
With one consent, society has always tried to drive 
the comic writers from this subject ; and with one 
consent the comic writers have refused to give it up. 
There have been endless attempts to bring in sen- 
timental comedy, lachrymose comedy, problematical 
comedy, but genuine comedy, ludicrous comedy, 
has always rallied and retained the field. 



The liberation of the intellect from all laws or 
bonds is best shown in the earth-upsetting comedy 
of Aristophanes. It is true that he was a conserva- 
tive, and tried to restore the o'erblown state to its 
ancient limits of modesty and order. But his treat- 
ment was homoeopathic. It was as though we should 
try to cure a madman by having a circle of maniacs 
dance about him with antic shout and gesture. It 
is all, however, a hurly-burly of ideas. Character 
painting, as we understand it, it hardly attempts, 
though Cleon and the Sausage-Seller are sketched 
with some fulness. Aristophanes's superb wit and 
poetry and thought keep his work from becoming 
travesty, but it is the parent of all succeeding trav- 
esty. 

The comedy of Moliere is the central comedy of 
the world. It resumes into itself all the genres of 
Menander and Plautus, as well as those of Ben 
Jonson, Congreve, and Sheridan. Even the fixed 
types of Italian comedy appear in it. Moliere was 
the composite smile of mankind. His comedy ranges 
from the clown and horse collar stage to the pensive 
mockery of the profoundest philosophy. He is 
always the defeated idealist who tortures himself by 
shattering the illusions which are dearest to his soul. 
He loves men and women with all his heart, and no 
one has exhibited them more naked and unadorned. 
His Alceste is as ridiculous as Don Quixote, and as 
noble. It is easy to satirize vice, to write with burn- 
ing indignation ; but to show the utter folly and 
futility of human life, and yet to make it lovable 
and desirable, was reserved for Moliere alone. It 
is fortunate that Louis IV. was more polite than 
penetrating. Tartuffe was a real blow to the ancien 
regime, and the scene between Don Juan and the 
Beggar was perhaps the first note of the French 
Revolution. 

Shakespeare's comedy is unique, though there is 
a trace of its charm in Calderon, and Alfred de 
Musset has given us a brilliant though shallow imi- 
tation of it. Shakespeare is the idealist who suc- 
ceeds. His comedy is the one art-work of the world 
which can bestow absolute happiness ; and this not 
once or occasionally, but again and again with un- 
staled liberality. It is the true Fountain of Youth 
the Age of Gold done into words. Shakespeare 
may almost be said to have created woman. Nowhere 
else does she exist in such bloom and perfume as in 
his comedy. Falstaff stands outside of the magic 
circle. He is Shakespeare's greatest contribution to 
ordinary comedy the comedy such as other men 
can write. Lacking Falstaff, however, we would 
still have Sancho Panza; but lacking Rosalind, 
Viola, Beatrice, Imogen, Perdita, Miranda, Sir 
Toby, Malvolio, Dogberry, Bottom, lacking Illyria, 
the Garden at Belmont, the forest of Arden, Pros- 
pero's enchanted isle, the Athenian glades, lack- 
ing these, what would there be in art to compen- 
sate us ? 

Hazlitt preferred Congreve's comedy to Shake- 
speare's. It was an odd taste ; but after Shakespeare, 
Congreve is, I think, the best English prose writer 



1898.]

best, not greatest, of course. For greatness there 
is required an intellectual and spiritual equipment 
that Congreve did not have. Yet the great prose 
writers, his compeers and successors, Dry den, Swift, 
Pope, and Johnson, seem to have looked upon him 
with a species of awe. His Valentine and Angelica, 
Mirabel and Millamant, are poor relations of Bene- 
dict and Beatrice, Orlando and Rosalind, in point of 
character, hut they have an equal estate of wit, and, 
what is more, a gift of speech so mysterious in its 
colloquial ease, its polished brilliance, that no one 
since has found its secret. 

When we turn to America for comedy, it is the 
snakes in Iceland over again. Americans have a 
credit for humor, hut our humor which gets into 
print is very pale and mild beside the broad and 
full-blooded mirth of other nations. Like the gen- 
tleman in Goldsmith, we hate what is low, and, 
though we are obligated to dance a hear, our hear 
dances only to the genteelest of tunes. We treat 
each other as if we had just graduated from a young 
ladies' hoarding-school, or were possible contributors 
to some Ladies' Journal. We will not see, at least 
in literature, that there is a coarse and animal side 
to life, and that for mere relief we must give it vent 
in speech if not in act. Abraham Lincoln knew 
this necessity of human nature, and kept himself up 
through the deadliest ordeals by lapses into the 
broadest fun. It is impossible to doubt that coarse- 
ness exists in our life, that Squire Westerns, and 
Wives of Bath, and Peachums, and Lockits, live in 
our midst. 

To a certain extent, the same prudery obtains in 
modern English literature. But Dickens was deli- 
ciously " low," Thackeray's books are one long 
rogues' gallery, and Stevenson went in for ferocity 
with a vigor that alienated his female constituency. 
I hardly know, however, where to look for coarse- 
ness or raciness in American literature. Mr. 
Howells's people are all respectable and genteel. 
Mr. James's are genteel, if they are not respectable. 
Mark Twain's Mississippi roustabouts never say any- 
thing which would bring a blush to the cheek of 
modesty. Bret Harte's heroes have the manners of 
grand opera. It is no better or worse if one 
goes backward. Dr. Holmes, a delicate humorist, 
seemed horn to preach the propaganda of the clean 
shirt. There is a precious spark or two of vulgarity 
in Irving, but it soon dies away into the general 
decency. Cooper's heroes are moral prize-winners. 
Gazing on all this wide expanse of clean linen and 
well-washed humanity, the soul aches for a little dirt. 

Is there no material for real comedy among us? 
Do n't our politicians bribe and betray ? Do n't our 
financiers bubble the community ? Do n't rich girls 
elope with coachmen ? Are there no scandals in the 
upper circles ? By the mass, no, if we may trust 
our books. Or if any of these things occur, they 
are treated with lamentation and tears, instead of 
with the ironic smile of the earth spirit which is 
comedy. It is a total misconception of genius to 
suppose that it will give us the highest if we forbid 



it to deal with the lowest. Chaucer's Wife of Bath 
is the corollary of the Prioress ; Falstaff is the 
necessary foil for Rosalind and Imogen. The rank- 
ness of the Decameron was necessary to grow the 
story of the Falcon, the most perfect brief narrative 
in literature. If we restrict our artists to the mid- 
dling, we must expect middling results. And medio- 
crity, hateful to God and men and columns, is what 
we have mainly got.

COMMUNICA TION. 

AN AMERICAN COMPATRIOT OF QAVAN DUFFY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, in his recently published 
autobiography, "My Life in Two Hemispheres," re- 
viewed in the last issue of THE DIAL, mentions, as the 
most interesting feature of his Irish newspaper, " The 
Nation," a number of young men who materially assisted 
the Irish cause by their poetical contributions to that 
journal. The plan of propagating the Nationalist re- 
form by poetry as well as by prose was one of the edi- 
tor's original designs, a plan whose utility had been 
attested by his earlier journalistic attempt, " The Belfast 
Vindicator." Sir Charles declares that he was most 
agreeably surprised not only by the effusions of the 
editors and immediate writers to " The Nation," but by 
the quality of the contributions from poets previously 
unknown. The Irish cause, under the leadership of 
" The Nation " in Dublin and the fiery eloquence of 
O'Connell in the House of Commons two forces that 
worked together for some time, however unfortunate 
their relations finally became, seemed to act as an 
inspiration to the young poets of Ireland as well as her 
poetical sympathizers in other lands. Thomas Davis, 
Duffy's most efficient co-worker in the management of 
the paper, who had never hitherto published a line of 
poetry, early achieved a poetical reputation in the pages 
of " The Nation " ; Clarence Mangan, already well 
known, added to his fame by his rhymical declarations 
in favor of repeal ; O'Callaghan, John Dillon, John 
Keegan, De Jean Fraser, and others, made the poet's cor- 
ner of the new journal its most conspicuous department. 

One of these young men, who materially contributed 
to the poetical reputation of Duffy's paper, died in New 
Haven a few months ago. It was about 1845 that Will- 
iam James Linton began to write for " The Nation," 
almost the only regular contributor, it is believed, who 
was not an Irishman. Linton was at that time thirty- 
three years of age ; and his leaning for the Irish " Na- 
tion " and its treasonable utterances, however much it 
may have shocked his family and friends, was in no way 
inconsistent with his previous career. In his earliest 
youth he had broken away from his ancestral traditions; 
had become a fond reader of Shelley's " Queen Mab " 
and Lamennais' " Paroles d'un Croyant " and a zealous 
champion of Republicanism and liberty. This associa- 
tion with men of doubtful conservatism had already es- 
tranged many useful acquaintances. He had already 
become the close friend and companion of Mazzini, and 
the confidant and in many cases the participator in his 
plots for the Italian cause; had formed, with the great 
Italian, the People's International League, whose aim 
was radically anti-monarchical ; had been one of the most 
conspicuous organizers of the People's Charter Union,

whose provisional rules, in Mr. Linton's own handwrit- 
ing, have been found among his papers ; had lived much 
with working-men, chartists, Polish and Russian refu- 
gees, and had undertaken several literary enterprises 
with the aim of transforming England into a Republic. 
It is not at all surprising, therefore, that Linton should 
have been profoundly affected by the new weekly news- 
paper at Dublin, which was pleading the Irish cause as 
it had never been pleaded before. In 1845 he became 
personally acquainted with Duffy, breakfasting with him 
at his hotel in the Haymarket, and also with Thomas 
Meagher. 

Duffy wished to engage Linton in his Young Ireland 
cause ; he believed that he would be useful in attaching 
to his banner the " remnants of the chartists," and en- 
couraged him to contribute to his paper. In response 
to the invitation, Linton wrote a large amount of prose, 
usually in the form of letters to the editor, discussing 
topics of policy on which he differed with the paper. 
These were signed by the pseudonym "Spartacus," 
which had already gained something of a vogue in " The 
Odd Fellow," a journal which Mr. Linton had edited 
for Henry Hetherington, one of the conspicuous anti- 
newspaper stamp agitators of the day. In 1849, Duffy 
invited Linton to join the staff of " The Nation," an 
honor prized by more pretentious litterateurs than the 
distinguished London wood-engraver. This invitation 
was, however, declined. Linton did not care to attach 
himself to any one paper; and there were things in " The 
Nation " such, for example, as its Catholic fervor 
to which he could not subscribe. He continued, however, 
as a contributor; and in 1849 began the publication in 
" The Nation " of his most important poetical work up 
to that time, his " Rhymes and Reasons Against Land- 
lordism." These poems had an extended vogue in their 
day, were collected in book form, and were deemed of 
sufficient merit to warrant an American edition twenty 
years later. 

These poems constituted one organic whole ; the same 
sentiment ran through them all, and the purpose was in 
every case the same. It was the author's desire to por- 
tray graphically, from every point of view, what he re- 
garded as the one monstrous wrong of English rule in 
Ireland the landlord system. Everything was subor- 
dinated to this end. He was no advocate of the separa- 
tion of Ireland from England, and was therefore out of 
sympathy with the chief cause "The Nation" was 
attempting to promote the repeal of the act of Union. 
Neither did he endorse the papal policy of Sir Gavan 
Duffy and his Catholic co-workers; the Pope represented 
to Mr. Linton everything that was evil and unprogres- 
sive. But in the landlord system he detected a genuine 
object of reform. Whatever faults Mr. Linton may 
have had, he was surely never half-hearted and insincere 
in any cause he had espoused; and the chief feature of 
his contributions to " The Nation," therefore, was their 
unbounded enthusiasm. His poems gave a consecutive 
picture of the Irish tenantry of that day and the injus- 
tices they suffered at the hands of their English mas- 
ters. All the every-day miseries of life in Ireland, and 
all its stock characters, appeared in graphic succession 
in his pages. Whatever one may think of the poet's 
philosophy, he certainly made his picture plain. The 
Irish peasant, ekeing out a bare existence in his miser- 
able hut, surrounded by his naked and half-starved wife 
and children, are held up in forcible contrast to his En- 
glish lord, living in splendor in his London house, 
squandering at the gaming-table and the race-track all 



the fruits of his tenants' toil. Linton always conceived 
the two characters in this way. He was unable, appar- 
ently, to imagine a tenant who had more than a potato 
a day, or a landlord who was charitable or virtuous. 
His poems were full of evictions, deaths by the wayside, 
famines, and the like familiar features of Irish life. The 
most cheerful picture throughout his pages is an occa- 
sional immigration to America or Australia. 
"Darkly speeds 'The Exile,' draining 
The life blood of the land." 

There is one interesting feature of Linton's verse and 
prose in " The Nation " to which he was himself accus- 
tomed to refer frequently in his later days. Mr. Linton 
was deeply interested in Mr. Henry George's economic 
theories; principally because they were almost identic- 
ally the same ideas that he had advocated in his early 
manhood. " This is a very excellent book," he used to 
say, referring to Mr. George's " Progress and Poverty," 
" but I preached those very same ideas forty years ago." 
Mr. Linton's cure for the injustice of the Irish land sys- 
tem, indeed, was the same as Mr. George's cure for pov- 
erty in general. 

Mr. Linton severed his connection with Duffy and 
" The Nation " about the year 1850, under unpleasant 
circumstances. The editor of " The Nation " was un- 
fortunate enough to cross Linton in his most delicate 
point his friendship for and admiration of Mazzini. 
Duffy frequently objected to Linton's association with 
the great Italian, whose hostility to the Pope made 
him unpopular to the " Young Ireland " people. Linton, 
however, loved Mazzini and respected his anti-papal 
policy, and could not be persuaded to abandon either. 
There was no rupture between Duffy and Linton until 
the former violently attacked Mazzini in the columns of 
" The Nation." Linton replied to the attack with such 
bitterness that he could not longer properly retain his 
connection with the paper. The two parted, therefore, 
though with no personal hostility. Duffy afterwards 
showed his regard for Linton when the latter was criti- 
cized by Thomas Carlyle as an " extremely windy crea- 
ture, of the George Sand, Louis Blanc species." " Mr. 
Linton," said Duffy, replying to this criticism, " was less 
a Republican of the school of George Sand and Louis 
Blanc than an English Republican of the school of Milton 
and Cromwell. Like many of the gifted young men of 
the time, he found himself drawn towards ' The Nation,' 
and contributed to it largely in prose and verse. I was 
delighted at the time, and still recall with pleasure the 
pictures he drew of the future we aimed to create." 

During Mr. Linton's residence at Appledore, in New 
Haven, he corresponded frequently with his old friend 
and editor. They lost track of each other after Duffy's 
departure to Australia, but when the latter returned to 
Europe and took up his residence at Cimiez, Nice, they 
renewed the old friendship. Linton, indeed, was almost 
the last survivor of the men who, fifty years ago, made 
" The Nation " such a powerful force in English politics. 
Several of Duffy's letters have been found among Mr. 
Linton's effects, in which he refers lovingly to the old 
times, " before we were grandfathers." " We failed, 
both of us," he says, in one of these letters, " in our 
immediate purpose, but it is a comfort in our declining 
years to know that we pursued it honestly, and that it 
will probably succeed in the end, though others will reap 
what we sowed. Let Danton's name perish from his- 
tory, but live the people ! ' "

PL.ATOXIC FRIENDSHIP.* 
Two trim volumes, now before us, contain 
nearly the whole of the ten years' correspond- 
ence (covering the last decade of the poet's life) 
between Robert Burns and Mrs. Dunlop. Of 
the letters in these volumes, forty-three of those 
written by Burns have been published else- 
where by Currie and other editors. The re- 
mainder, comprising thirty-eight of Burns's 
letters and ninety-seven of Mrs. Dunlop's, are 
now printed for the first time. The holographs 
of this new matter form the Lochryan MSS. 
now in the possession of Mr. R. B. Adam, of 
Buffalo, N. Y., and were in all probability 
never seen by Currie. The interweaving of the 
new letters with the old makes the correspond- 
ence of Burns with Mrs. Dunlop, as given in 
the present volumes, rarely complete, a careful 
search after possible lacunae having disclosed, 
as Mr. William Wallace, the painstaking editor, 
tells us, only four places where it can safely be 
stated that a letter of Burns is missing, while of 
the total of Mrs. Dunlop's it seems that Burns 
had lost or destroyed only nine. 

Mrs. Dunlop's acquaintance with Burns be- 
gan in 1786 ; and of all the friendships the 
poet made, in Ayrshire and elsewhere, none, 
says Gilbert Burns, seemed more agreeable to 
him than this one. Burns was on the point of 
starting for Edinburgh before Mrs. Dunlop had 
heard of him. She was suffering from a fit of 
depression consequent upon a long illness, when 
chance put into her hands a copy of the newly 
printed " Poems." Opening the book at the 
pages ^containing The Cotter's Saturday 
Night," she was so charmed and aroused by 
the sweet and true verses that she despatched a 
messenger post to Mossgiel, some fifteen miles 
away, with a note asking the poet for a half- 
dozen copies of the poems, and bidding him 
call at Dunlop House at his earliest convenience. 
Mrs. Dunlop was a lady of standing and of 
" quality," and a descendant of the illustrious 
Wallace to boot ; and the flattered bard lost no 
time in replying to her missive in his very 
worst that is to say, his most stilted and arti- 
ficial style. Those unfamiliar with Burns's 
letters will find it hard to believe that the au- 
thor of " Scotch Drink " or the address to his

" Auld Mare Maggie " could have penned, save 
as a joke, the following gorgeous preamble to a 
note thanking a friendly old lady for an order 
for his poems and an invitation to call on her. 
" I am fully persuaded that there is not any class of 
mankind so feelingly alive to the titillations of applause 
as the Sons of Parnassus; nor is it easy to conceive how 
the heart of the poor Bard dances with rapture when 
those, whose character in life gives them a right to be 
polite judges, honor him with their approbation." 

Mrs. Dunlop's rejoiner to this effusion is lost ; 
but her subsequent letters leave no doubt that 
she replied to it at length and in true Richard- 
sonian style. Thus began a correspondence 
which, though it flagged a little occasionally on 
either hand, ended only with the poet's life. 
Begun with zeal and industry on both sides, it 
was carried on for a year or two with zest. It 
slackened as early as 1789, one or other cor- 
respondent keeping silent for a time, Burns 
being the usual offender, and Mrs. Dunlop 
growing thereupon reproachful, nay, even 
angry, once so much so as to send him a curt 
note written in the third person. That the poet 
valued his correspondent most highly is clear, 
and he once assures her, in his usual high- 
flown (epistolary) style, that her letters form 
"one of the most supreme of his sublunary 
enjoyments," and, again, that he would rather 
have " a sheet of her Prose than a second poem 
on Achilles by Homer, or an Ode on Love by 
Sappho " But there are occasional signs in 
his letters that there were seasons when even 
this ineffable " Prose " palled upon the recip- 
ient. It is pretty evident here and there that 
it was not read very carefully, if even at all, 
which is not altogether unpardonable, since 
Mrs. Dunlop could be prolix and " preachy," 
and, when in critical vein, provoking ; and the 
bard had his fits of depression and listlessness. 
Her wooden strictures on the " undecencies " of 
" Tarn O'Shanter " would have tried the temper 
of a saint ; and she sent the author of " Duncan 
Grray " and " The Banks of Doon " reams of 
her own mild poetic chirpings, " as a child," 
she modestly (yet expectantly) says, " might 
scratch mathematical schemes to Sir Isaac 
Newton." Mrs. Dunlop was a better critifc of 
conduct than of poetry (she counsels her pro- 
tege to imitate " the chaste Thomson " !), and 
her advice to Burns as to mending his ways 
was as uniformly sound as that in regard to 
mending his verses was the contrary. 

After Burns's visit at Dunlop House, toward 
the close of 1792, the correspondence languished 
perceptibly, though the letters written show no 
abatement in cordiality of tone. About two 



316 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



years later, Mrs. Dunlop went up to London, 
and from that time broke off writing suddenly 
and unaccountably, and it now appears finally. 
The Lochryan MSS. go to confirm the charge 
that she " deserted " Burns before he died, for- 
sook him at the period when he most needed 
friends and solace. Scott Douglass reckons the 
term of this " desertion " at " two years "; but 
the discovery of a letter bearing date January 
12, 1795, reduces the period to about eighteen 
months. But a desertion it was, and, we are 
constrained to think, an unfeeling one. Mrs. 
Dunlop was even proof against Burns's dying 
appeal, written a few days before the end came. 
With the shadow of death plainly upon him, 
the poet took up his pen to close forever the 
correspondence with the friend who had turned 
unaccountably cold toward him. 

" Madam, I have written you so often without recg. 
any answer, that I would not trouble you again but 
for the circumstances in which I am. An illness which 
has long hung about me in all probability will speed- 
ily send me beyond that bourne whence no traveller re- 
turns. Your friendship with which for so many years 
you honored me was a friendship dearest to my soul. 
Your conversation and especially your correspondence 
were at once highly entertaining and instructive. With 
what pleasure did I use to break the seal ! The remem- 
brance yet adds one pulse more to my poor palpitating 
heart ! Farewell ! ! ! " 

Mr. Wallace, the present editor, is at some 
pains to account for, perhaps we may say to pal- 
liate, Mrs. Dunlop's course. He ascribes her 
abandonment of Burns to " inadvertance," 
which seems to us a rather lenient way of put- 
ting it. But there is certainly no direct and 
sufficient cause of alienation discoverable. The 
tone of the letter just quoted indicates that 
Burns himself could have assigned none. There 
is in it no allusion to or trace of contrition for 
any past specific act of his that might have led 
to a breach. His old friend had unaccountably 
forsaken him, and his heart was sore ; that was 
all. Doubtless, when the grave at last closed 
over him, and the full pathos and significance 
of his last words came home to Mrs. Dunlop, 
she sincerely repented her neglect. Such re- 
grets come in time to most of us, and only those 
who have felt them know their poignancy. 
Looking broadly at this whole matter, one is 
inclined to suspect that at bottom Mrs. Dunlop's 
cult (it really amounted to that while it lasted) 
of Burns was more or less of what we now term a 
fad. The patrician lady (she boasted rather 
more than the customary " Scotch ell of gen- 
ealogy ") certainly warmly admired the poetic 
gift of her rustic neighbor ; and, as the phrase 
runs, she " took him up." Doubtless she at first 



idealized the author of " The Cotter's Saturday 
Night," and for long but dimly discerned the 
somewhat gross and earthly side of him. But 
time and intimacy brought their disillusion- 
ments. Mrs. Dunlop was something of a pre- 
cisian and a stickler for the proprieties ; and 
as Burns the poet merged more and more in 
her apprehension into Burns the unpolished 
farmer and loose-living exciseman, her enthu- 
siasm cooled proportionately, and in the end she 
was not unwilling to " drop " him. She now 
lives dimly in the memory of man solely by 
virtue of having known him. 

The relation, Mr. Wallace thinks, between 
Burns and Mrs. Dunlop is unique in literary 
history. She was not to him what Mme. de 
Warens was to Rousseau, or what the " divine 
Emily " was to Voltaire, or what Charlotte von 
Stein was to Goethe. She seems to have had 
some notion of playing Lady Hesketh to his 
Cowper. What she wished to be to him is indi- 
cated in an early letter : 

" I have been told Voltaire read all his manuscripts 
to an old woman and printed nothing but what she ap- 
proved. I wish you would name me to her office." 

Burns (" never very amenable to counsel," as 
he owned) did not accede to this modest re- 
quest for which incompliance posterity may 
be truly thankful. With all her fondness for 
criticism, Mrs. Dunlop was not a blue-stocking. 
Even her spelling (which the editor has left 
partly unconnected) leaves on the score of cor- 
rectness much to be desired. But she knew, as 
Mr. Wallace notes, her Bible, her Thomson, 
her Shenstone, her Richardson, and her Field- 
ing ; and her interest in literature was keen and 
unaffected. Judged as compositions, her letters 
are by no means models of their kind ; but they 
tell us scarcely less of Burns than do Burns's 
Therein lies their value ; and whosoever

writes of Burns the man hereafter will do well 
to study them. Apart from the general impres- 
sion of him one gathers from them, they afford 
here and there fresh bits of biographical infor- 
mation. One learns, for instance, that Burns 
might have been a military officer, and alter- 
natively a professor in the University of Edin- 
burgh, and that Adam Smith once thought of 
making him a Salt Officer in the Customs ser- 
vice at thirty pounds a year. Touching the 
first possibility, Mrs. Dunlop wrote Burns, Feb- 
ruary 26, 1787 : 

" Have your friends been able to point out any future 
plan for you; or, as Pope said, shall Homer provide for 
his children; or, if so, in what line would you wish it? 
I suspect a military one, though without any other reason 
than the red berries you add to the beautiful garland of

the tenth Muse,* who, like the tenth wave of her seas, 
overtops all the rest that went before her." 

To this slenderly-based surmise the poet replied : 
" Would the profits of that [an edition of his poems 
then printing] with rapture I would take your hint of a 
military life, as the most congenial to my feelings and 
situation of any other, but, what is wanting cannot be 
numbered.' " 

In her reply of a week later Mrs. Dunlop, 
having thought the matter over, proceeded to 
throw cold water on the not very promising 
military scheme. 

" Indeed in your situation a military line wears sev- 
eral attractions, not wholly to be slighted, but which 
would be too dearly purchased by laying out your all 
for an ensigncy which, when you had it, could not make 
you happy, placed in a rank you could with difficulty 
support, unable to assist a mother or a friend with your 
purse, or comfort them with your presence, harassed and 
tost about, torn from those you loved, and condemned 
to a slavish dependence, a subaltern obedience to the 
capricious orders of petulaut, ignorant boys, who, though 
your inferiors in everything valuable, would despise 
talents they had not knowledge to discover or taste to 
relish, and pretend to overlook you were your hair worse 
drest or your hat worse cocked than their own. Indeed, 
should any of the nobles of the land present you with 
a pair of colors, the case would be very different, but I 
hope and trust you will never think of buying into the 
army unless you can command at least 250 more than 
the 400 which is the regulated price. I am sure I am 
right in this, and, if I saw you, could convince you by a 
thousand reasons. At any rate the pomp of war is more 
for poetry than practice, and although warriors may be 
heros, peace soldiers are mostly powdered monkies. So 
you see, if it will not do, I comfort you like the tod with 
the sour plums."f 

As for the University of Edinburgh professor- 
ship, it seems that in 1789 Mrs. Dunlop pressed 
Burns hard to become an applicant for the new 
Chair of Agriculture founded by Mr. William 
Johnstone Pulteney, afterwards Baronet of 
Westerhall ; but the poet hardly appears to have 
given the project serious thought, believing, as 
he said, that the post was for him unattainable. 

Burns's " religion of the heart " finds new 
and eloquent expression in several of the Loch- 
ryan letters. The following passage occurs in 
a consolatory note, called forth by the death of 
Mr. Henri, a son-in-law of Mrs. Dunlop. 

" Thomson says finely 

' Attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds 
And offices of life to life itself 
And all its transcient joys sit loose.' 

And yet, like many other fine sayings, it has, I fear, 
more of philosophy than human nature in it. Poor 
David's pathetic cry of grief is much more the language 
of man: <O Absalom! My son! My son!' A world to 
Come ! is the only genuine balm for an agonizing heart, 
torn to pieces in the wrench of parting for ever (to mor- 
tal view) with friends, inmates of the bosom and dear to 

t " Coila " of " The Vision "; stanzas 9 and 46. 
*The Scotch equivalent of the Fox and the Grapes. 



the soul! The most cordial believers in a Future State 
have ever been the Unfortunate. This of itself; if God 
is good, which is I think the most intuitive truth in 
Nature ; this very propensity to, and supreme happiness 
of, depending on a Life beyond Death and the Grave, is 
a very strong proof of the reality of its existence." 

Again, on August 2, 1788, he writes : 
" I am in perpetual warfare with that doctrine of our 
reverend priesthood, that ' we are born into this world 
bondslaves of iniquity and heirs of perdition, wholly 
inclined to that which is evil, and wholly disinclined to 
that which is good, untill by a kind of spiritual filtra- 
tion or rectifying process called effectual Calling,' etc., 
the whole business is reversed, and our connections above 
and below completely change place. I believe in my 
conscience that the case is just quite contrary. We 
come into this world with a heart and conscience to do 
good for it, untill by dashing a large mixture of base 
alloy called prudence alias selfishness, the too precious 
metal of the soul is brought down to the blackguard 
sterling of ordinary currency." 

To certain familiar letters of Burns's which 
have been variously interpreted, those of Mrs. 
Dunlop form in several instances the needed 
supplement. Supporters of the modern view 
that Burns was an " inspired faun " and a 
" lewd peasant of genius " will find their char- 
itable theory controverted in advance in a 
hitherto unprinted letter from the poet, which 
may be read in connection with one of Mrs. 
Dunlop's bluntly informing him that " A gen- 
tleman told me with a grave face the other day 
that you certainly were a sad wretch, that your 
works were immoral and infamous, that you 
lampooned the clergy and laughed at the ridic- 
ulous parts of religion, and he was told you 
were a scandalous free-liver in every sense of 
the word." In one new letter we find the bad- 
gered poet defending himself against a charge 
of writing Fescennine verse : 

" I am very sorry that you should be informed of my 
supposed guilt in composing, in some midnight frolic, a 
stanza or two perhaps not quite proper for a clergy- 
man's reading to a company of ladies. That I am the 
author of the verses alluded to in your letter, is what I 
much doubt. You may guess that the convivial hours of 
men have their mysteries of wit and mirth ; and I hold it 
a piece of contemptible baseness to detail the sallies of 
thoughtless merriment or the orgies of accidental intox- 
ication to the ear of cool sobriety or female Delicacy." 

There is a touch of unconscious humor in this 
vindication not unworthy of Richard Swiveller. 
Mr. Wallace's editing is of the best sort 
vigilant, helpful, and unobtrusive ; and the pub- 
lishers have done their part in a tasteful way. 
There are frontispiece portraits of Burns and 
Mrs. Dunlop, together with some interesting 
facsimiles. Burns students will welcome these 
comparatively fresh and interesting volumes.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



THE MONUMENTS AND ANTIQUITIES 
OF GREECE.* 

Some eight years ago, under the fantastic 
title of " The Golden Bough," was published 
a work which immediately took rank as a classic 
in its special field of comparative mythology 
and folklore. The author, Mr. J. G. Frazer, has 
since then devoted the large leisure of a Trinity 
College fellowship thrice renewed to the com- 
pletion of what is probably the greatest labor 
of erudition accomplished by any English 
scholar of this generation, a translation of 
Pausanias, with commentary and indices, in 
six volumes. 

Pausanias travelled through Greece at the 
time of the Antonines, in the second century, 
and composed what we may style an ancient 
Baedeker or Murray, with the qualification that 
it omits what Mr. Hare calls dull useful infor- 
mation about inns and restaurants, and gives 
more space to garrulous historical and archae- 
ological disquisition than its modern successors. 
Pausanias had many predecessors now lost to 
us. There is still extant, under the name of 
Dicaearchus, a pupil of Aristotle, a fragment 
of a lively description of Greece in which Thebes 
is portrayed with true Attic malice and Tanagra 
and its worthy farmers are picturesquely ex- 
tolled. We hear also of numerous special anti- 
quarian treatises, such as Polemo's four books 
on the offerings of the Acropolis, or the work 
of Theodorus the Phocsean on the Round Build- 
ing at Delphi. These and countless other works 
Pausanias doubtless consulted at one of the 
great public libraries of the empire, in order to 
correct and supplement his notes of travel and 
the dubious erudition of the local guides, who, 
as a hint of Plutarch informs us, were as per- 
tinacious and voluble in Greece as they are in 
the Italy of to-day. He was a commonplace 
but painstaking and conscientious writer, liable 
now and then to blunder, and incapable of ex- 
ercising serious scholarly criticism on the vast 
mass of matter accumulated in his notes. He 
simply sets down, in a mechanical but conven- 
ient topographical order, what he saw and what 
he heard on the spot or subsequently read about 
it. His style, Mr. Frazer, who ought to know, 
characterizes as " looose, clumsy, ill- jointed, ill- 
compacted, rickety, and ramshackle." These 
facts have made him a sort of butt of modern 
German scholarship, which has no tolerance for 
anything but the loftiest genius and the most

absolute originality. It is assumed in his case, 
as in that of Cicero, that because the man, like 
all the rest of us, refreshed his memory with sec- 
ondary authorities, therefore he never saw the 
objects he pretends to describe nor read the 
books from which he quotes. From these ex- 
aggerations Mr. Frazer is free. In a closely 
written introduction, he vindicates by internal 
evidence, as well as by the excavations of the 
last three decades, the essential fidelity and cor- 
rectness of his author, and extracts from his 
work everything that illustrates the man's intel- 
lectual makeup, tastes, and beliefs. The re- 
mainder of the bulky first volume is occupied 
by the excellent translation, which entirely su- 
persedes worthy old Thomas Taylor and the 
hack-work version in the Bohn's Library. The 
Greek text, easily accessible in the Trubner 
edition, is not given ; but an appendix to the 
translation discusses all doubtful passages or 
important variations. 

The imagination is oppressed by the require- 
ments of an exhaustive commentary on Pau- 
sanias, whether contemplated as an ideal or in 
the concrete achievement of Mr. Frazer's two 
thousand compact pages crammed with the 
minutest statements of specific fact, vouched 
for by chapter and verse citation of an appalling 
mass of technical literature. What Pater says 
of the Rome of that day is equally applicable 
to the Greece which Pausanias described. At 
no period of its history had it been better worth 
seeing. " As in some vast intellectual museum, 
all its manifold products were intact and in 
their places, and with custodians also, still ex- 
tant, duly qualified to appreciate and explain 
them. The various work of many ages fell here 
harmoniously together, as yet untouched save 
by time." The munificence of Hadrian and 
Herodes Atticus had endowed Greece with 
many new structures of utility or splendor ; but 
still, as Plutarch tells us, the bloom of an un- 
dying youth dwelt on the creations of Phidias 
and Ictinus. Still, in many an ancient temple 
the conical stone or smoke-begrimed wooden 
images (xoana) of primitive fetichism, or the 
rigid faintly smiling figures of infantine Greek 
art, remained in startling juxtaposition with the 
masterpieces of Polyclitus and Praxiteles. The 
old wooden column that testified to the prehis- 
toric origins of Greek architecture still stood 
beside its fellows of stone in the temple of Hera 
at Olympia. The quaint pillar-shaped Apollo 
of Amycla3 still stood on the sofa-like throne 
which the Magnesian Bathycles decorated for 
him with the gold of Cro3sus. The Olympian

guides still showed, in the back chamber of the 
temple of Hera, that miracle of early art, the 
cedar- wood chest richly wrought with reliefs in 
ivory and gold, dedicated by the old tyrant 
Cypselus in commemoration of the chest in 
which his mother had hidden him from the as- 
sassins. The shields of the Spartans captured 
at Sphacteria were still proudly exhibited on 
the Acropolis of Athens. The spoils of the bar- 
barian still decorated the national shrine of 
Delphi, and the three entwined serpents of 
bronze now at Constantinople still displayed the 
names of the Greek cities that crushed the Per- 
sian at Plataea. On the walls of the Cnidian 
Lesche at Delphi, where the other day the 
French spade revealed a few bits of stucco 
painted with bright pigment, the cheeks of 
Cassandra still glowed rosy in the frescoes of 
Polygnotus, already as old as the frescoes of 
Giotto are to us. And though Megalopolis the 
great city had become " a great wilderness," 
and teeming Bosotia had been converted into a 
sheep-walk, the depredations of the dilettante 
proconsuls and emperors of Rome had not yet 
perceptibly diminished the population of bronze 
and marble gods, heroes and athletes, that still 
bore witness of the glory and loveliness that had 
passed away at Delphi, Olympia, and Athens. 
The commentator who would resuscitate this 
vanished world, and, following in Pausanias's 
footsteps, interpret, correct, and supplement 
him, must be philologian, topographer, archaeol- 
ogist, architect, and art critic in one, and must 
in addition be master of the allied disciplines 
of Greek history, antiquities, religion, mythol- 
ogy, and folk-lore. He must further be familiar 
with the results of the excavations of the past 
thirty years. He must know what the Germans 
did at Olympia, and what the French are doing 
at Delphi : what Schliemann and Dorpfeld 
found at Mycenae and Tiryns ; the work of the 
British school at Megalopolis, of the American 
school at Corinth, Argos, Icaria, and Sicyon, 
of the Greek archaeological society at Eleusis, 
Epidaurus, and Lycosura, not the facts only, 
but the vast literature of interpretation and con- 
troversy that has sprung up about them. Every 
page of Pausanias bristles with special " Fra- 
gen," each jealously guarded by a corps of watch- 
ful specialists, who from time to time publish 
pamphlets in which they refute one another and 
uphold their own ingenious " combinations." 
And of all these, our commentator must run 
the gauntlet. 

Mr. Frazer modestly disclaims competency 
in so wide a field, and confesses that he is an 



expert in none of the branches of Archaeology. 
But his indefatigable erudition in codifying and 
his sound judgment in estimating the work of 
specialists have made him a very passable imi- 
tation of an expert in all, and there are few 
living scholars with whom he could not discuss 
on equal terms almost any topic in these vol- 
umes. To the high authority of Dr. Dorpfeld 
in all questions of Architecture he shows proper 
deference, but that he has not altogether abne- 
gated the right of private judgment may be 
inferred from the observation, " On a question 
of the state of Athens in the fifth century B. C., 
I decidedly prefer the evidence of Herodotus 
and Thucydides to that of Dr. Dorpfeld and 
Professor von Wilamovitz Mollendorf." More 
specifically, he rejects Dorpfeld's identification 
of the fountain Enneacrunns with the meagre 
cistern in the rock at the foot of the Pnyx, vig- 
orously combats his theory that the pre-Persian 
temple of Athena on the Acropolis was rebuilt 
in the face of the Erechtheum and served as 
the treasury of the goddess, refuses to accept 
his view of the situation of " Dionysus in the 
Marshes," dissents from his identification of 
the Pythium with the Cave of Apollo on the 
north side of the Acropolis, and approves the 
arguments of Professor John Williams White 
against his opinion that the Pelargicum re- 
mained a fortress down to the days of Herodes 
Atticus. 

On the vexed question of the high stage, after 
perusing Dr. Dorpfeld's recent book he still 
maintains, with the majority of French and 
English scholars, the tradkional view. This 
debate is fast approaching a dialectical dead- 
lock. On the one hand, we have the intrinsic 
improbability of a very high stage, and Dr. 
Dorpfeld's masterly skill in employing his su- 
perior knowledge of architecture to explain 
away everything in the extant remains that to 
the layman seems to point to its actual exist- 
ence in the Greek theatre. On the other side, 
there is the feeling of scholars that it requires 
a suspicious amount of special pleading to 
eliminate the high stage from the tradition of 
antiquity, and the possibility at least of inter- 
preting the extant plays in harmony with the 
tradition. Mr. Frazer sums up fairly well the 
usual arguments against Dr. Dorpfeld's view. 
Like Haigh, he overlooks the fact that the 
Delian inscription to which he appeals for the 
identification of the logeion with the stage 
building is a conjectural restoration ; and he is 
mistaken in affirming that the passage in which 
Lucian describes the ludicrous downfall of an 



320

[May 16, 



actor in full tragic toggery necessarily implies 
a fall from the high stage to the orchestra. But 
it is obviously impossible to enter upon the de- 
tail of Mr. Frazer's notes here. 

In the field of anthropology and folklore 
alone he collects material enough for a respect- 
able volume. Tree worship, the cap of invisi- 
bility, miraculous conceptions, the egg in myth- 
ology, female kinship, the marriage of the dead, 
the use of different languages by husband and 
wife, tribes that abstain from salt, the apple as 
a love token, the forty-one types of the story of 
the girl exposed to the dragon, the twenty-eight 
versions of the tale of the clever thief, divina- 
tion by " hefting," by water, by lightning, by 
lizards and livers, the anointing of sacred stones, 
the clothing, the fettering, and the painting red 
of sacred images, the use of pigs' blood in puri- 
fication, cursing as a means of invoking bless- 
ings, the beating of the ground to fertilize it, 
the ceremonial clipping of the hair, serpent 
worship, prohibition of widows' marriages, the 
sacrifice of a finger to avert evil, such are a 
few of the topics on which he pours forth his 
copious and exact erudition. 

And as we turn the pages, still the wonder 
grows. Mr. Frazer will explain to you the 
chemical cause of the rich golden patina on the 
columns of the Parthenon ; the precise differ- 
ence between the welding and soldering of iron, 
and why the art of Glaucus must have been the 
former ; the engineering problems involved in 
the drainage of the Copaic lake ; the exploita- 
tion of the silver mines of Laurium in ancient 
and modern times ; the geological formation of 
the Isthmus of Corinth and the digging of the 
Isthmian canal ; the composition of the stucco 
used by Greek builders ; the effect on Greek 
architecture of the use of unburnt brick ; the 
different shaped clamps used in binding Greek 
masonry ; the early history of the arch and the 
five styles of masonry that may be distinguished 
in the walls of Plataea ; why the ancient byssos 
cannot have been cotton, and the effect of our 
civil war on the cultivation of cotton in Greece ; 
the nature and origin of amber, etc. He will 
gossip entertainingly about the fighting cocks 
of Tanagra, the singing trout of the river 
Aroanius, which, like Pausanias, he failed to 
hear, " though he tarried by the river till sun- 
set when they were said to sing loudest "; the 
earliest known parrots and peacocks ; the his- 
tory of the elephant and the rhinoceros in an- 
tiquity ; the white blackbirds of Cyllene and the 
possibility that they were selected by protective 
resemblance to the mountain snows ; the rela- 



tion of the pygmies to the dwarfs of central 
Africa, and a hundred other equally delightful 
themes. And all this, as well as his more seri- 
ous discussion of archa3ological and historical 
problems, is relieved by interesting notes of 
travel and charming descriptions of Greek 
scenery the falls of the Styx, the lakes of 
northern Arcadia, the view from the Acro- 
Corinthus, the pass of the Tretus, the caves of 
the Erasmus, the Valley of Sparta, Sicyon, 
Epidaurus, Troezen Ithome, Bassffi, and Arca- 
dian Aliphera " mountain-built with peaceful 
citadel." 

" Oh settentrional vedovo sito, 
Poi che private sei di mirar quelle." 

An appendix of one hundred and fifty pages 
apparently brings all this multifarious learning 
down to date, quoting the journals for 1897 
and all the important new books of the year. 
In renewing our thanks to the author for this 
splendid gift, we should not forget the pub- 
lishers, who have merited well of the republic of 
letters by their willingness to undertake in the 
cause of learning the immense preliminary 
expenditure necessarily involved in the careful 
printing of such a mass of detail, with all the 
accompanying maps, plans, and illustrations. 
They seem to have spared no pains to make 
the work an indispensable thesaurus of knowl- 
edge for all who take interest in the geography, 
the monuments, and the antiquities of Greece. 

PAUL SHOREY. 



WILLIAM MORRIS'S LAST ROMANCES.* 



The work of William Morris has very dis- 
tinctly gone through a number of phases. The 
labors of some men strike at the beginning a 
certain keynote, which is kept without great 
change to the end. Mr. Swinburne's latest 
prose and verse follow in the main the direc- 
tions which his earlier efforts took, and he is 
to-day, however broadened and deepened, the 
man who took the world, as it were, by storm. 
The writer, on the other hand, who produced 
" The Defence of Guinevere " is very different 
from the man who produced " The Story of the 
Glittering Plain" and "The Water of the 
Wondrous Isles." There has been here not 
only a deepening of the intellectual life, but a 
rise into a new and somewhat alien sphere, alien 
to the dream-like poetry with which he began

his career ; and yet there is also a return : the 
mysticism which marked Morris's first volume, 
abandoned during his middle years, reappears 
in the later books. 

The life of William Morris presents a tire- 
less energy which converts admiration into its 
primal element of wonder. He did enough for 
half a dozen men ; indeed, he was not merely 
one but half a dozen persons. His successes 
as a decorative artist were sufficient to fill the 
ambition of a large mind, and yet they were 
cast into the shade by his purely literary work. 
This latter also spanned a wider field than most 
men care to undertake, and still the excellence 
in diverse ways remains singular and note- 
worthy. 

The early volume of poems, " The Defence 
of Guinevere," was full of a vague suggestion 
that gave it a certain indefinable charm, and 
that yet stood in the way of its general accept- 
ance. " The Life and Death of Jason " fear- 
lessly emerged from this half-darkness, but re- 
tained the power of dealing simply and directly 
with the mysterious, which is found again in 
so high a degree in the last prose romances. 
There is no intention here of going through the 
long catalogue of Morris's works. That has 
already been done in a previous number of this 
journal. The purpose is to show rapidly and 
briefly his progress and unfolding. He has 
reached the stage when he calls himself the 
" idle singer of an empty day." " The Earthly 
Paradise " is filled with an undertone of sadness 
and resignation ; the hopelessness of attempting 
to deal with riddles which seem more insoluble 
than ever the riddles of life and death 
pierces through that dazzling array of poems 
with a strange persistency. The lyrics which 
introduce the division into months give a mod- 
ern touch, in contrast and yet in harmony with 
the old-world stories unrolling before us like 
pictures on a tapestry. But the emergence from 
this atmosphere already shows in the work. In 
" The Lovers of Gudrun " we enter another 
world, the world of genuine men and women, 
who have many and grievous ills, who are torn 
by conflicting emotions and impulses, and who, 
above all, live, and feel that their lives have 
purpose and meaning. The clear and invigor- 
ating air of the Northern legends seems to have 
been better and healthier for the heroic lungs 
of William Morris than the suaver imaginings 
of warmer climes. 

The great " Sigurd the Volsung " combines 
in itself all the splendid qualities of William 
Morris's genius. It is, we think, the high- 



water mark of his literary productivity. All 
the great elements of the various versions of 
the great stories which it tells once more are 
combined in it. The Volsunga Saga and the 
Niebelungenlied are laid under contribution ; 
the mysterious is subordinated to the human in 
it ; and the manner of telling has only so much 
of the archaic as to give remoteness and breadth. 
The interest in real life pervades it ; the heroic 
in action and the delight of achievement are 
celebrated in its ringing lines. The poet has 
come out of the dreamland of ",The Earthly 
Paradise "; if life cannot be understood, it yet 
affords a large field for the doing of things 
worthy to be done ; and, in the Morality, 
" Love is Enough," we are told that we may 
dispense with everything that the world ordin- 
arily esteems, provided we have affection and 
sympathy and space wherein to labor. This 
may not be a satisfactory solution of our diffi- 
culties, but it is a long advance over the idle- 
ness of an empty day. In this connection a 
word may be interpolated about the translation 
of the Odyssey and the ^3neid and the Norse 
Sagas. Whatever may be said of them as suc- 
cesses in the impossible art of reproducing a 
poem in an alien medium, they indisputably 
have the merit of reading as if they were to the 
manner born ; they are as much a part of En- 
glish literature as though they had first seen the 
light of day under the changeable English skies. 
They add to our impression of the heroic activ- 
ity of the writer, who could give us these as 
well as the vast body of his original work. Here 
is, indeed, an Anglo-Saxon Sigurd with limit- 
less capacity for forging marvels and an un- 
shaken hold upon youth and all that it implies. 
This is not the place to say much about 
Morris's devotion to the cause of socialism ; the 
latter years of his life were intensely given to 
it, and his prose romances show its influence 
clearly enough. No doubt these romances 
sprang out of his Northern studies and his 
changed outlook upon mankind and the world. 
The breath of Mediaeval Romance is all through 
them. They point to simpler forms of living, 
to fellowship in having and doing, to adven- 
tures generously pursued for the welfare of the 
many. They occupy a unique place in the lit- 
erature of the day, and it is not an easy matter 
to assign to them the consideration which is 
their due. Of them all, the first to be published, 
the " House of the Wolfings," will perhaps 
command the most general acceptance. The 
communal life described in that book had 
doubtless its serious fascination for the author, 



322 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



and the story is written throughout with un- 
flagging enthusiasm. The motive is simple 
and inspiring, the series of pictures varied and 
finished. How far the allegorical tendencies of 
these romances are to be pushed is a question 
which hardly calls for a categorical reply. 
" The Story of the Glittering Plain " lends 
itself readily to a consistent interpretation 
which can hardly have been entirely absent 
from its author's intention. " The Roots of 
the Mountains " was, we are told, the best of 
the romances in Morris's opinion. The last of 
them, " The Sundering Flood," may surely re- 
ceive a high meed of praise. The allegory, if 
allegory there be, is not forbidding in its diffi- 
culty, nor carried out with undesirable minute- 
ness. The conquest of love and faith over 
seemingly insuperable obstacles is made plain 
and convincing ; the heroism of Osberne shines 
like that of Sigurd himself ; the counsellor and 
guide, Steelhead, is not an altogether mysterious 
personage ; and the final return to the simple 
and wholesome life of the dalesman, from the 
complications of a civilization not conscious of 
itself or its needs, points a moral and adorns a 
tale. With " The Water of the Wondrous 
Isles " one may perhaps be pardoned for hav- 
ing some questionings ; although no one need 
have any questionings as to the heroine, Bird- 
alone, in her courage and her womanliness. 
Nor will one have any questionings in regard 
to the springlike freshness which pervades the 
entire story, the wealth of incident, the clear- 
ness of description, the exhaustless resources of 
an imagination which knows no such thing as 
weariness. Still, the voyage from island to 
island of the wondrous sea has more of the 
allegorical about it than the sundering flood, 
and the magical element in the book removes 
it more from the prosaic sympathies of the day. 
No one need, however, take the whole as other 
than it presents itself to be ; and then, the nar- 
rative is admirable. Through the various trials 
of inexperience, the girl Bird alone, helped by 
the mystical wood-mother Habundia, passes, 
and in her triumphs uplifts with herself all 
those with whom she comes in contact. The 
indescribable charm and atmosphere of the art 
of William Morris are over both books, and one 
may as well surrender at discretion to that 
magic and influence. 

The founder of the Kelrnseott Press would 
gladly hold in his hand these volumes, such fine 
exemplars of the printer's art are they. If a 
good story ought to have a goodly investiture, 
it has been given in the present instance ; and 



the fortunate possessor of these romances will 
not only have two beautiful books, but two 
happy specimens of the work of a man whose 
recognition as one of the leaders of his time, 
and a benefactor of the race, is assured.

MEXICO THROUGH FRIENDLY EYES.* 

Mr. Lummis is always enthusiastic : he loves 
or he loves not. And just now his love is Mex- 
ico, and in " The Awakening of a Nation " he 
gives us some striking and suggestive sketches. 
He sees much to admire in Mexico, and a great 
part of what he admires is due to Spanish influ- 
ence. This is unwelcome just now when it is 
the fad to hate and despise Spain and the Span- 
iard. But, after all, hatred and contempt alter 
no facts ; and it is true that the Spaniard has 
been a wonderful explorer, a not unkind con- 
queror, and a marvellously good governor, more 
than once. 

" His marca is upon the faces, the laws, the very land- 
scape. How significant this is, we may better judge 
when we remember that the Saxon, masterful though he 
is, has never anywhere achieved these results. He has 
filled new lands with his speech and his faith (or his 
lack of it), but only by filling them with his own blood, 
never by changing the native. The United States, for 
instance, is of his speech; but what Indian tribe speaks 
English? In the vastly greater area of Spanish Amer- 
ica, every Indian tribe speaks Spanish and has done 
so for centuries. The Saxon has never impressed his 
language or his religion upon the people he has 
overrun." 

It was that same Spaniard in America who 
developed in Mexico a golden age of letters in 
the sixteenth century, long before Plymouth 
Rock felt pilgrim footsteps. Mr. Lummis does 
well to hint at this. " The Bay Psalm-Book " 
was not the first book printed in America, nor 
were " The Jesuit Relations " the " very first 
beginnings of American literature." How naive 
and amusing such claims would be, were they 
not humiliating evidence of narrow ignorance ! 
The first American books were in Spanish, of 
course ; and they represent a great variety in 
subject, treatment, and character. Some fea- 
tures of that early literature are most curious. 
Thus, as Mr. Lummis says : 

" Another striking point in the literary history of 
Mexico and one wholly without parallel in ours is 
this: in the first generation after the Conquest there was 
already in Mexico a band of Indian authors like Tobar, 
Zapata, Tezozomoc, Chimalpain, Camargo, Pomar, the

Ixtlilxochitls, and others, whom no student of Ameri- 
cana can ignore." 

How can we fit this with our narrow prejudice : 
" It is curious to remember that up to 1830 no 
book was ever so handsomely published in the 
United States as the Lorenzana edition of the 
Letters of Cortez,' in Mexico in 1770." We 
have called the sixteenth century a golden age 
of letters in Mexico. It was such. At that time 
there was there poetry of a high order ; there 
was history, chronicle, belles-lettres ; there was 
philosophy and theology ; there was science 
and very creditable science too. The University 
of Mexico was flourishing and turning out bril- 
liant scholars long before Harvard was dreamed 
of. Model industrial schools with hundreds of 
Indian pupils, where not only theory but trades 
were taught, grew up under devoted friars. 
Even schools for the careful study of the native 
Indian tongues existed, and a college of twenty 
diligent students studying the Otomi language 
had been established in the Indian town of 
Huiskelucan. 

But Mr. Lummis does not unduly linger 
over the past. He deals with Mexico of to-day 
an awakened nation. One of his first asser- 
tions will come with a shock to our prejudice 
and ignorance. " To-day Mexico is and I say 
it deliberately the safest country in America. 
Life, property, human rights, are more secure 
than even with us." This is the Mexico of 
to-day, not the Mexico of twenty years ago. 
Few realize the vast changes of a single year in 
our sister republic. Yet Mr. Lummis's state- 
ment might have been made, in fact it was 
made, years ago. In London, in 1892, 1 heard 
a prominent man lecture on Mexico. He said : 
" Many consider Mexico dangerous, believe 
that life and property are not secure. I know 
well all parts of the United States, and do not 
hesitate to say that life and property are more 
secure in every part of Mexico than in any of 
the United States." I felt that this was the 
rabid utterance of a prejudiced Englishman, - 
but I did not then know Mexico. 

Mr. Lummis treats of the natural resources 
of the country, describes the ferment now lead- 
ing to their development, and shows how a 
financial condition which would paralyze us has 
been to Mexico, with her different conditions, 
a helpful stimulus. He gives glimpses of the 
great enterprises now undertaken. The old 
mining industry, once the great wealth of the 
country, is still important, but will soon be 
insignificant when compared with the agricul- 
tural, manufacturing, and carrying industries. 



He emphasizes, and with the highest justice, the 
fact that this mighty progress is chiefly due to 
one person not only a great Mexican, but a 
great man Porfirio Diaz, the President of the 
Republic. He sketches the romantic career of 
this man in whose hands the national destiny 
has so long rested. We do not grudge one 
word of praise to Diaz ; he deserves it. But 
we might wish that our author had a little 
more emphasized the work of that inscrutable 
Indian, Juarez, to whom personally and polit- 
ically Diaz owes so much. 

We will quote but one more passage from 
our author : it is not simply captious. 

" It is notorious to those who know both countries 
thoroughly, that educated Americans are far more igno- 
rant of Mexico than educated Mexicans are ignorant of 
the United States. One reason is, doubtless, that we 
are the more shining mark; but another is that the 
Latin- American nations have rather different ideas of a 
diplomatic service. They do not send to any country 
an ambassador who will be lost there without an inter- 
preter. Even down to consuls, this ridiculous supersti- 
tion is operative. Men are selected who are at least 
gentlemen in appearance; who can command the respect- 
ful attention of business men; who know how to ask for 
the information they desire. The result is that Mexico 
is steadily informed of the moods and needs of this 
country." 

A pity 't is 't is true.

THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



Theodore Watts-Dunton. His occasional contribu- 
tions of verse to " The Athenaeum," together with 
the few pieces that have already found their way 
into the anthologies, have served to whet to a keen 
edge the interest of literary students, who have long 
felt it a wrong to letters that a poet of such extra- 
ordinary critical acumen and technical mastery of 
the art of rhythmical expression should remain un- 
known save to the few who had tracked him to his 
haunts. Two or three years ago, the announcement 
was made that his poems were at last to be produced 
by his friend William Morris in a Kelmscott vol- 
ume, and the interest of book-lovers was all agog at 
the prospect. The untimely death of Morris put an 
end to this project, and affected Mr. Watts-Dunton 
in a way of which he must be allowed to speak for 
himself. "Among the friends who saw much of 
that great poet and beloved man during the last 
year of his life, there was one who would not and 
could not believe that he would die myself. To 
me he seemed human vitality concentrated to a point 
of quenchless light ; and when the appalling truth 
that he must die did at last strike through me, I had 
no heart and no patience to think about anything in 
connection with him but the loss that was to come 
upon us." The next year, nevertheless, the writer 
put forth in a thin booklet his superb "Jubilee 
greeting at Spithead to the Men of Greater Britain," 
a poem which gives impassioned embodiment to the 
patriotic sentiment of the occasion by which it was 
inspired, and which is equalled we hardly dare to 
say surpassed only by the " Recessional " of Mr. 
Kipling. This publication gave us at least a fore- 
taste of what might be expected from " The Com- 
ing of Love, and Other Poems," the volume which 
has at last seen the light. It is safe to say that this 
volume is one of the strongest and most original 
contributions to literature that have been made of 
recent years, and that there is no living English 
poet save only Mr. Swinburne from whose 
hands we might expect a gift of greater and more 
lasting value. Mr. Watts-Dunton drinks from his 
own glass, which is both wide-brimmed and ample ; 
and his utterance, whatever may be its subject, 
has the touch of high distinction that marks the 
difference between the artists and the mechanics of 
verse. In its choice of subject, indeed, the art of 
the poet is put to the severest of tests in the titular 
poem, which fills about a third of the volume, and 
is a sequence of sonnets, lyrics, and dramatic epi- 
sodes which tell of the poet's love for the gypsy 
maiden Rhona. This maiden is absolutely unlet- 
tered, and much of the story is told in her own 
words, including a plentiful infusion of Romany 
vocables and uncouth English phrases. No more 
unpromising material than this could well be imag- 
ined, yet the result impresses the reader first and 
last as poetry of a high order. Let us quote two 
stanzas from Rhona' s letter to her absent lover. 
" She sez, ' The whinchat soon wi' silver throat 
Will meet the stonechat in the bnddin whin, 
And soon the blackcap's airliest gillie 'nil float 



From light-green boughs through leaves a-peepin thin ; 
The wheat-ear soon 'ull bring the willow-wren, 
And then the fust fond nightingale 'ull follow, 
A-callin ' Come, dear,' to his laggin hen 
Still out at sea, ' the spring is in our glen ; 
Come, darlin, wi' the comin o' the swallow.' " 

The thought on't makes the snow-drifts o' December 

Shine gold,' I sez, ' like daffodils o' spring 

Wot wait beneath : he 's comin, pups, remember ; 

If not fer me no singin birds 'ull sing : 

No choring chiriklo 'ull hold the gale 

Wi' ' Cuckoo, cuckoo,' over hill and hollow ; 

There '11 be no crakin o' the meadow-rail, 

There '11 be no ' Jug-jug ' o' the nightingale, 

For her wot waits the comin o' the swallow.' " 

" The Coming of Love " as a whole is difficult to 
characterize. It is too episodical to form a contin- 
uous story, yet it has emotional unity, and this trag- 
edy of the soul, passing from the careless joy of the 
years " before the coming of love " into the raptur- 
ous days when " natura benigna " is the watchword 
of the world, and through these to dark days of 
suffering with their sinister vision of " natura ma- 
ligna," winning at the end a passionless and trans- 
cendental peace, seems to offer a typical portrayal of 
the pilgrim's progress of the inner life. And scat- 
tered through it all are such unforgettable verses as 

"Song leaps from deeps unplumbed by spoken word," 
and 

" If heaven's bright halls are very far from sea, 

I dread a pang the angels could not 'suage," 
and 

" Love is still his own orthographer 
As when on scriptured leaves of asphodel 
He taught his earliest pupil, Eve, to spell," 
and 

" From that dear harp, her heart, whose chords are love," 
and 

" Though Love be mocked by Death's obscene derision, 
Love still is Nature's truth and Death her lie," 

and, most wonderful of all, the " First Kiss " sonnet, 
long familiar to all who treasure the purest gold of 
English poetry, yet which we venture to quote for 
the sheer pleasure of transcription. 

" If only in dreams may Man be fully blest, 
Is heaven a dream ? Is she I claspt a dream ? 
Or stood she here even now where dew-drops gleam 
And miles of furze shine yellow down the West ? 
I seem to clasp her still still on my breast 
Her bosom beats : I see the bright eyes beam. 
I think she kiss'd these lips, for now they seem 
Scarce mine : so hallow'd of the lips they press'd. 
Yon thicket's breath can that be eglantine ? 
Those birds can they be Morning's choristers ? 
Can this be Earth ? Can these be banks of furze ? 
Like burning bushes Jired of God they shine ! 
I seem to know them, though this body of mine 
Passed into spirit at the touch of hers ! " 

The verse which we have ventured to italicize would 
not be easy to match, even in the greatest of our 
poets. The remaining contents of this volume 
include, besides the miscellaneous section, the poem 
called " Christmas at the Mermaid," a lyrical rosary 
whose beads are told by Jonson and Raleigh and 
Drayton and " W. H.," singing now the praises of 
the friend who has lately left London for the quiet

of Stratford, now the glories of English patriotism 
as illustrated by the repulse of the Armada, and 
all the great deeds that were still thrilling in English 
souls. The miscellaneous pieces are mostly sonnets, 
and nearly all of them are of an occasional or per- 
sonal character. They establish beyond cavil the 
place of their author among the great English sonnet- 
writers, a place beside Milton and Keats and Words- 
worth and Rossetti. It is hard to choose among 
poems of such beauty and distinction, but perhaps 
the sonnet-sequence " What the Silent Voices Said," 
inspired by the funeral of Tennyson, may be taken 
as the high-water mark of the poet's achievement in 
this sort of memorial verse. Of the six sonnets thus 
linked together, we quote the last. 
" Beyond the sun, beyond the farthest star, 
Shines still the land which poets still may win 
Whose poems are their lives whose souls within 
Hold naught in dread save Art's high conscience-bar 
Who have for muse a maiden free from scar 
Who know how beauty dies at touch of sin 
Who love mankind, yet, having gods for kin, 
Breathe, in Life's wood, zephyrs from climes afar. 
Heedless of phantom Fame heedless of all 
Save pity and love to light the life of Man 
True poets work, winning a sunnier span 
For Nature's martyr Night's ancestral thrall : 
True poets work, yet listen for the call 
Bidding them join their country and their clan." 

Two sonnets, one addressed to Mrs. Garfield in the 
hour of her great sorrow, the other " To Britain and 
America" on the death of Lowell, have a peculiar 
interest to American readers, and no generous Amer- 
ican can be deaf to the appeal of such lines as these : 

" How shall ye honor him whose spirit stands 
Between you still ? keep Love's bright sails afloat, 
For Lowell's sake, where once ye strove and smote 
On waves that must unite, not part, your strands." 

During the past few weeks the name of Mr. 
Stephen Phillips has become, in certain critical quar- 
ters at least, one to conjure with. The loud acclaim 
which has greeted his recent volume of " Poems," 
coupled with the notoriety attendant upon his ex- 
ploitation by a self-constituted English " Academy," 
have together made his name familiar to a great 
many readers. The thin volume by which the ex- 
travagant claims made for Mr. Phillips by his spon- 
sors must either be justified or fall to the ground 
is now before us, and the question becomes pertinent 
whether he has really achieved greatness or merely 
had it thrust upon him by over-zealous friends. 
When we remember the sort of thing that even so 
sane and conservative a critic as R. H. Hutton not 
so long ago said in " The Spectator " about the then 
newly-discovered poet of " Wordsworth's Grave," 
we are at least given pause at sound of the praise 
that has been heaped upon Mr. Phillips, and made 
to realize the unwisdom of a stampeded judgment. 
Some degree of suspicion is justifiable under these 
circumstances, and it is therefore something of a 
surprise to find the work of Mr. Phillips on the 
whole so admirable. It is of very uneven quality, 
indeed, and such poems as " The Wife " and " The 
Woman with the Dead Soul," which have been sin- 



gled out for special praise, do not impress us as being 
quite deserving of it. Mr. William Watson has 
recently dissented from this critical acclaim, point- 
ing out very justly that a great theme is as import- 
ant as noble treatment in the making of tragedy. 
There is, of course, a question-begging element in 
this criticism, for the human soul may rise to gran- 
deur in the most humble or sordid environment ; but 
at least the poet should not emphasize, as Mr. Phillips 
seems to do, the prosaic surroundings of the women 
whose tragedy is portrayed in these two poems. As 
Mr. Raskin has said more than once, the dying-out 
of the soul within a man or a woman is an awful 
thing, fit for the most tragic contemplation ; but the 
effect may be spoiled by an excess of realism in the 
treatment. At least the realism should be spiritual 
rather than material, a truth that Mr. Phillips seems 
not to have grasped in writing the poem with which 
his volume opens. Yet, for all this defect, there 
are wonderful things in the poem, particularly these 
lines descriptive of the dying soul's last moments of 
hectic life. 

" For not at once, not without any strife, 
It died ; at times it started back to life, 
Now at some angel evening after rain, 
Builded like early Paradise again, 
Now at some flower, or human face, or sky, 
With silent tremble of infinity, 
Or at some waft of fields in midnight sweet, 
Or soul of summer down in the dark street." 

There are exquisite things, too, in the " Christ in 
Hades " phantasy, by which Mr. Phillips first made 
himself known a year or more ago, and which comes 
at the close of the present collection. But our highest 
praise and remaining space must be reserved for 
" Marpessa," a poem which could hardly have been 
written had it not been for Tennyson's " Tithonus," 
which is constantly awakening echoes of the great 
singers of the past, yet has so distinctive a beauty of 
its own that we should mourn indeed were it to be 
lost out of the treasury of our literature. " Mar- 
pessa, being given by Zeus her choice between the 
god Apollo and Idas a mortal, chose Idas " such 
is the descriptive legend which introduces us to the 
poem. Here is the plea of Idas for the love of 
Marpessa, a passage of such perfect beauty as to 
need no commentary. 

" I love thee then 

Not only for thy body packed with sweet 
Of all this world, that cup of brimming June, 
That jar of violet wine set in the air, 
That palest rose sweet in the night of life ; 
Nor for that stirring bosom all besieged 
By drowsing lovers, or thy perilous hair ; 
Nor for that face that might indeed provoke 
Invasion of old cities ; no, nor all 
Thy freshness stealing on me like strange sleep. 
Not for this only do I love thee, but 
Because Infinity upon thee broods ; 
And thou art full of whispers and of shadows. 
Thou meanest what the sea has striven to say 
So long, and yearned up the cliffs to tell ; 
Thou art what all the winds have uttered not, 
What the still night snggesteth to the heart. 
Thy voice is like to music heard ere birth, 
Some spirit lute touched on a spirit sea ; 
Thy face remembered is from other worlds,

It has been died for, though I know not when, 
It has been sung of, though I know not where. 
It has the strangeness of the luring West, 
And of sad sea-horizons ; beside thee 
I am aware of other times and lands, 
Of birth far-back, of lives in many stars. 
O beauty lone and like a candle clear 
In this dark country of the world ! Thou art 
My woe, my early light, my music dying." 

Even the god cannot match the eloquence of this 
appeal, and the maiden makes choice of the mortal. 
The lot of Tithonus seems to her far less desirable 
than the lot of human lovers who grow old together, 
in whom passion of youth becomes transmuted into 
the calm affection of maturity. 

"So shall we live. 

And though the first sweet sting of love be past, 
The sweet that almost venom is, though youth, 
With tender and extravagant delight, 
The first and secret kiss by twilight hedge, 
The insane farewell repeated o'er and o'er, 
Pass off ; there shall succeed a faithful peace ; 
Beautiful friendship tried by sun and wind, 
Durable from the daily dust of life." 

The poem which contains these passages, and others 
of almost equal beauty, constitutes a real addition 
to English song, and makes us exceedingly hopeful 
of the writer's future. 

We have given up hoping for great things from 
Mr. William Watson. He has a considerable talent 
for serious verse of the higher imitative order, but 
that talent was displayed almost if not quite as fully 
in his first volume as in any succeeding one. " The 
Hope of the World " is the eighth collection of orig- 
inal verse that he has put forth, and is, like its pre- 
decessors, a curious mixture of strength with weak- 
ness, of intellectual passion with mere rhetorical 
froth. For one thing, Mr. Watson cannot get rid 
of the self-consciousness that even here, in his latest 
volume, prompts him to describe himself as 
" Singing a nation's woe, in wonder and ire, 
Against me half the wise and all the great." 

One of the most unfortunate things about Mr. Wat- 
son's verse is that it so often inevitably invites com- 
parison with the greatest achievements of English 
song, and naturally to its discomfiture. Readers of 
" Hellas, Hail ! " cannot help thinking of the glori- 
ous lyrical outburst of another " Hellas," while the 
poem to " The Unknown God " deliberately chal- 
lenges comparison with Mr. Kipling's magnificent 
" Recessional." Whatever may be the philosophical 
justification for the intellectual attitude of this invo- 
cation, the poverty of its form is evident enough 
when we put by the side of the poorest of Mr. Kip- 
ling's stanzas such a passage as the following : 

" Best by remembering God, say some, 

We keep our high imperial lot. 
Fortune, I fear, hath oftenest come 
When we forgot when we forgot ! " 

We cannot ignore a contrast thus forced upon our 
attention, and the pale abstractions of Mr. Watson's 
verses make but a poor showing by the side of the 
rich imagery and the religious passion of Mr. Kip- 
ling's hymn. In this as in his other volumes Mr. 



Watson is at his best when he essays some bit of spir- 
itual portraiture, as in these " Jubilee Night " verses : 
" Long watched I, and at last to the sweet dale 

Went down, with thoughts of two great women, thoughts 

Of two great women who have ruled this land ; 

Of her, that mirrored a fantastic age, 

The imperious, vehement, abounding spirit, 

Mightily made, but gusty as those winds, 

Her wild allies that broke the spell of Spain ; 

And her who sways, how silently ! a world 

Dwarfing the glorious Tudor's queenliest dreams ; 

Who, to her wellnigh more than mortal task, 

Hath brought the strength-in-sweetness that prevails, 

The regal will that royally can yield : 

Mistress of many peoples, heritress 

Of many thrones, wardress of many seas ; 

But destined, more melodiously than thus, 

To be hereafter and forever hailed, 

When our imperial legend shall have fired 

The lips of sage and poet, and when these 

Shall, to an undispersing audience, sound 

No sceptred name so winningly august 

As Thine, my Queen, Victoria the Beloved ! " 

The poet of " Homeward Songs by the Way " has 
endeared himself to the lovers of contemplative 
verse, and his new volume will meet an appreciative 
welcome from readers whose souls are attuned to 
the elusive harmonies of his soft and dreamy meas- 
ures. In " The Earth Breath, and Other Poems " 
Celtic color and glamour are blent with a strain of 
oriental mysticism, and the product is exquisitely 
imaginative and tender. It is indeed a " fountain 
of shadowy beauty " (to quote one of the happiest 
titles of the volume) whose springs are at the com- 
mand of this fine spirit, but the passion is no less 
deep for being veiled in these subtle mists of deli- 
cate imagery. Let us reproduce one of the simpler 
lyrics. 

" Image of beauty, when I gaze on thee, 
Trembling I waken to a mystery, 
How through one door we go to life or death 
By spirit kindled or the sensual breath. 

" Image of beauty, when my way I go ; 
No single joy or sorrow do I know : 
Elate for freedom leaps the starry power, 
The life which passes mourns its wasted hour. 

" And, ah, to think how thin the veil that lies 
Between the pain of hell and paradise ! 
Where the cool grass my aching head embowers 
God sings the lovely carol of the flowers." 

Lovelier than these verses, if such a thing be possi- 
ble, are the stanzas which dedicate the volume to 
Mr. W. B. Yeats. 

" I thought, beloved, to have brought to you 
A gift of quietness and ease and peace, 
Cooling your brow as with the mystic dew 
Dropping from twilight trees. 

" Homeward I go not yet ; the darkness grows ; 
Not mine the voice to still with peace divine : 
From the first fount the stream of quiet flows 
Through other hearts than mine. 

" Yet of my night I give to you the stars, 
And of my sorrow here the sweetest gains, 
And out of hell, beyond its iron bars, 
My scorn of all its pains." 

The " Poems of a Country Gentleman " are simple 
and sincere exercises in verse, reflecting the moods 



1898.] 



THE DIAL

of a recluse and a lover of nature. The pretty 
fancy embodied in the lines entitled " On the Roman 
Wall " may serve to illustrate this writer's quality. 
The flower in question is a corydalis, a native of the 
Campagna. 

" Fair, simply-blowing floweret wild, 

Small, short-lived star of earth, 
Then, like some gypsy-stolen child, 
Art here of alien birth 

" (Here, where the grassy mound I trace, 

Green foss and ruin'd wall, 
That tells me of a conquering race 
And the proud conqueror's fall.) 

" For, musing here on Hadrian's dyke, 

How far away seems Rome ! 

And I, to find elsewhere thy like, 

Must seek it there, at home. 

" How earnest thou thence ? from that bright land 

March 'd legions in array ; 
But whose the soft and gentle hand 
That brought the flower away ? 

" Sick of the time and all its fears, 

Did some Italian maid. 
Watering thee oft with secret tears, 
Nurse thee thro' sun and shade ? " 

Mr. Newbolt's " Admirals All " has had a marked 
popular success in England, and the reason is not 
far to seek. These lyrics are of sufficiently stirring 
quality, and sufficiently filled with the pride of En- 
glish achievements in warfare, to make them highly 
acceptable to readers of the indiscriminating sort. 
Technically, they are very faulty, but few readers 
care anything for such a matter when they can get 
the sort of thing that here follows : 

"Splinters were flying above, below, 

When Nelson sailed the Sound : 
' Mark you, I wouldn't be elsewhere now,' 

Said he, ' for a thousand pound ! ' 
The Admiral's signal bade him fly, 

But he wickedly wagged his head : 
He clapped the glass to his sightless eye, 
And 'I'm damned if I see it ! ' he said. 

" Admirals all, they said their say 

(The echoes are ringing still). 
Admirals all, they went their way 

To the haven under the hill. 
But they left us a kingdom none can take 

The realm of the circling sea 
To be ruled by the rightful sons of Blake, 

And the Rodneys yet to be." 

The Celtic imagination, so rich in color, so pas- 
sionate in utterance, and so devoid of real intellec- 
tual content, glows in the ballads and lyrics of Mrs. 
Shorter, and lends them at least a transient beauty, 
although their spell is dissolved by the corrosive 
touch of analysis. The most characteristic of these 
pieces are the ballads, to which a brief quotation 
would hardly do justice ; we must, then, perforce 
select for our example one of the simpler lyrics, 
and " Wishes " will do as well as another for the 
purpose. 

"I wish we could live as the flowers live, 

To breathe and to bloom in the summer and sun : 
To slumber and sway in the heart of the night, 
And to die when our glory had done. 



44 I wish we could love as the bees love, 

To rest or to roam without sorrow or sigh : 
With laughter, when, after the wooer had won, 
Love flew with a whispered good-bye. 

44 I wish we could die as the birds die, 

To fly and to fall when our beauty was best : 
No trammels of time on the years of our face ; 
And to leave but an empty nest." 

The peculiarly Celtic qualities of Mrs. Shorter's 
verse reappear in the collected poems of Miss Fiona 
Macleod, but touched with a finer art and glowing 
with a richer passion. These are indeed " Songs 
from the Hills of Dream," and the light that is upon 
them never shone upon earth's landscape, save to 
the spiritual vision. No unpurged eye may view 
" The Rose of Flame," but to the poet it is truer than 
truth itself. 
" Oh, fair immaculate rose of the world, rose of my dream, 

my Rose ! 
Beyond the ultimate gates of dream I have heard thy mystical 

call: 
It is where the rainbow of hope suspends and the river of 

rapture flows 
And cool sweet dews from the wells of peace forever fall." 

The thought of a peace " beyond these voices " seems 
to brood over the writer's imagination, again and 
again inspiring such a strain as the above, or as is 
found in these stanzas : 

" It lies not on the sunlit hill 

Nor on the sunlit plain : 
Nor ever on any running stream 
Nor on the unclouded main 

14 But sometimes, through the Soul of Man, 

Slow moving o'er his pain, 
The moonlight of a perfect peace 
Floods heart and brain." 

One or two extracts do scant justice to the rare and 
exquisite beauty of these songs and lyrical ballads ; 
one must become steeped in them to get their full 
effect, and for this nothing less than the volume itself 
will suffice. 

In Mr. Lionel Johnson's new volume we have still 
another example of the Celtic spirit renascent, but 
the work is in this case tempered by broad intellec- 
tual culture, and is no less rich in content than in 
color. The noble ode to Ireland, which stands in 
the forefront of the collection, is at once passionate 
and austere, the utterance of a Celt with a wider 
than the Celtic outlook. One stanza may be given 
to illustrate the form and spirit of this fine poem. 
" Proud and sweet habitation of thy dead ! 

Throne upon throne ; its thrones of sorrow filled ; 

Prince on prince coming with triumphant tread, 

All passion, save the love of Ireland, stilled. 

By the forgetful waters they forget 
Not thee, O Inisfail ! 

Upon thy fields their dreaming eyes are set. 

They hear thy winds call ever through each vale. 

Visions of victory exalt and thrill 

Their hearts' whole hunger still : 

High beats their longing for the living Gael." 

It is not every Irishman who could write of Crom- 
well in the spirit of Mr. Johnson's poem upon the 
death of the Protector, from which we take the open- 
ing and closing stanzas :

" Now, on his last of ways, 

The great September star, 
That crowned him on the days 

Of Worcester and Dunbar, 
Shines through the menacing night afar. 

" Nay, peace for ever more ! 

O martyred souls ! He comes, 
Your conquered conqueror : 

No tramplings now, nor drums, 
Are his, who wrought your martyrdoms. 

" Tragic, triumphant form, 

He comes to your dim ways, 
Comes upon wings of storm : 

Greet him, with pardoning praise, 
With marvelling awe, with equal gaze ! " 

Fervent hymns of the faith in Latin and English, 
fragments of liturgical adaptation, poems of persons, 
memories, and occasions, all imbued with lofty and 
sincere thought and emotion, are offered by this 
memorable volume, which fully establishes the au- 
thor's position among the best of living English poets. 

There is nothing new in the collective issue of Mr. 
Henley's " Poems," but lovers of what is best in 
recent English song will welcome this definitive and 
corrected edition of a poet who has always written 
with rare sincerity, and has ever been unwilling to 
derogate, for the sake of mere popularity, from high 
and worthy ideals of his art. An introductory note 
explains why a single volume of no great dimensions 
is ample to contain the poetical product of a quarter 
of a century. " Small as is this book of mine, it is 
all in the matter of verse that I have to show for 
the years between 1872 and 1897. A principal 
reason is that, after spending the better part of my 
life in the pursuit of poetry, I found myself (about 
1877) so utterly unmarketable that I had to own 
myself beaten in art, and to addict myself to jour- 
nalism for the next ten years." There are defeats 
that are better than victories, of which truth our 
time has offered no better example than the author 
of the lines 

" I am the master of my fate, 
I am the captain of my soul." 

Mr. Henley's utterance is as strongly individual as 
that of Mr. Meredith, for example, but is not affected 
by the pronounced mannerisms that often make that 
poet so grotesquely unreadable. A striking portrait, 
from the bust by Rodin, provides this welcome vol- 
ume with a frontispiece. 

" A Selection from the Poems of Mathilde Blind," 
made by the loving hands of Mr. Arthur Symons, 
preserves in one small volume all that is likely to be 
remembered of the lyric output of that great-hearted 
woman. Poet in a high sense she was not, yet the 
emotion that throbbed so intensely in her life and 
is regchoed in these pages cannot leave the reader 
unaffected by its glow. Here is a tender song than 
which nothing lovelier came from her pen and heart : 
" Thou walkest with me as the spirit-light 

Of the hushed moon, high o'er a snowy hill, 
Walks with the houseless traveller all the night, 

When trees are tongueless and when mute the rill. 
MOOD of my soul, O phantom of delight, 
Thou walkest with me still. 



" The vestal flame of quenchless memory burns 
In my soul's sanctuary. Yea, still for thee 
My bitter heart hath yearned, as moonward yearns 

Each separate wave-pulse of the clamorous sea : 
My Moon of love, to whom for ever turns 
The life that aches through me." 

Very typical of our transition age are these outpour- 
ings of a soul that clings passionately to the sub- 
stance of a faith whose forms and formulae have 
become outworn. The old wine is too precious to 
be spilled, yet the new bottles for its preserving have 
not yet come from the mould. The mood is one that 
has not found complete reconcilement with philos- 
ophy, and which accepts with something less than 
perfect resignation the ideal of " Nirvana." If at 
one moment it can say, 

" Enter thy soul's vast realm as Sovereign Lord, 
And, like that angel with the flaming sword, 

Wave off life's clinging hands. Then chains will fall 
From the poor slave of self's hard tyranny 
And Thou, a ripple rounded by the sea, 
In rapture lost be lapped within the All," 

at another it is constrained to exclaim, 

" But when resurgent from the womb of night 

Spring's Oriflamme of flowers waves from the sod ; 
When peak on flashing Alpine peak is trod 

By sunbeams on their missionary flight ; 

When heaven-kissed earth laughs, garmented in light ; 
That is the hour in which I miss my God." 

The name of Tupper has not hitherto been one 
with which to conjure in English literature, but it 
now wins a new association through Mr. W. M. 
Rossetti, who has edited the posthumous verse of 
his old friend John Lucas Tupper. The author of 
this verse lived from 1826 to 1879, was a sculptor 
first and a draftsman afterwards, was acquainted 
with the P. R. B., and published several poems in 
" The Germ." These are now reprinted, together 
with perhaps fifty pieces left in manuscript. They 
at least justify publication, and perhaps more than 
that. They have quaintness, vivid imagination, ro- 
mantic feeling, and an occasional touch of poignant 
sincerity. The latter quality, at least, appears in 
the first lines of the poem called " Aliens." 

" Love, when I meet thee face to face, 
I feel thou art not of my race ; 
I know thy language is not mine, 
Or only so in the hollow sign 
The lips make. Of my world of things 
Thou hast no care or questionings, 
Nor I of thine. 

" What words are said between us twain 
I strive to recollect, in vain. 
Such merest sound the words we say, 
Our souls might be in separate spheres 
That own another night and day ; 
Thy smile, God knows, may count for tears ! " 

Mr. Rossetti finds the salient characteristics of his 
friend's verse to be an acute susceptibility to impres- 
sions, a true lyrical impetus, a certain comic feeling, 
and a repugnance to some aspects of modernism. 
The slender volume in which these qualities are dis- 
played is one to be read with pleasure, and to stand 
in a niche of its own in the temple of minor Victo- 
rian verse. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



in explanation heightens our interest in any 

of the French description of the present French 
Republic. Republic is the nature of the issues at 

stake during the first twenty years of its history. No 
mere question of tariffs or finance, important as these 
may be, separated the parties. It was the more funda- 
mental problem of the organization of the powers of 
the central government. This has been the dominant 
political question since the Empire, for the social and 
administrative organization which France now pos- 
sesses has been undisturbed by all the minor revo- 
lutionary shocks. Baron de Coubertin, the author 
of "The Development of France under the Third 
Republic" (Crowell), is therefore particularly for- 
tunate in his subject. He is also the first to present 
in English an adequate treatment of it. If he has 
not been altogether happy in the use of his oppor- 
tunity, it is not because his book is weakened by 
erroneous views, but because of his tendency to be- 
come Delphic the moment he reaches a difficult ques- 
tion. For instance, when he discusses the position 
of the Senate in relation to the responsibility of 
ministers, he takes refuge in phraseology so vague 
that a page of interpretation is needed before the 
reader, vho goes to the book for instruction, may 
comprehend what it is all about. The volume gains 
in definiteness as the narrative proceeds. When the 
author reaches the history of the Ferry ministry, 
his account becomes clear and straightforward. 
Later, nevertheless, in the chapter on the Colonies, 
the trouble begins again, and he seems to be making 
passes in the air instead of reaching the heart of 
the subject. We are assured in the Introduction, 
by no less an authority than Dr. Albert Shaw, that 
the author is the Tocqueville of the present day. 
This does not seem to argue a fitting appreciation 
of either that famous Frenchman's matter or style. 
Would Tocqueville have ascribed such wonderful 
powers to the statesmen of the Constituent As- 
sembly as to assert in the same sentence that these 
gentlemen " chopped down " monarchical institutions 
and "gave birth" to the Constitution of 1791? 
Does not Baron de Coubertin's sentimentality get 
the better of his sense of humor when he eulogizes 
the Republic for giving the French army the Rus- 
sian army as its " sister " ? It is a possibility that 
the translator may be partly responsible for the tone 
of many similar sentences, especially the one which 
affirms that the French met the attacks of the Ger- 
man press "with every appearance of the most 
haughty calm." Baron de Coubertin is a critic fav- 
orable to the Republic, and evidently believes in its 
stability. His account of the reconciliation of the 
Church and the Republic is clear and sufficiently 
detailed, but it is half spoiled by a sermon which he 
has attached to it on the nature of religion, remark- 
ing by the way that the French are generally too 
" superior " to feel the need of worship, although " the 
Gallic soul is captivated by death, and takes pleas- 
ure in contemplating, during a joyous life, the dis- 



quieting and grand perspectives of the world be- 
yond." One of the most interesting suggestions in 
this book is the theory that the Exposition of 1889 
restored confidence in the Republic, and brought 
France safely through the crisis of discontent sym- 
bolized in the Bonlanger episode. " So it came to 
pass," says the author, " that, by virtue of having 
tasted for the space of several months the very great 
and very noble joy of commanding the attention of 
the world, the French citizen set to reading over 
with care the ballot which was slipped into his hand, 
and when he had read it he flung it aside and took 
another." 

It is to be hoped that the forbidding 

title of a recen ' work b y M*. E. p. 

Evans, "Evolutional Ethics and Ani- 
mal Psychology" (Appleton), will not prevent the 
general reader from turning the pages of the volume 
sufficiently to convince him that the book is one of 
great interest, and in style and treatment is ad- 
dressed to a popular clientele. Evolutional ethics 
is the story of the development of the relation be- 
tween man and the animal world ; and a very inter- 
esting story it is. The conception of ethical relations 
as involving the rights of others is at first narrow, 
and only gradually broadens with the broadening 
influences of civilization. At first the tribe marks 
the horizon of ethical duties, and members of other 
tribes are enemies without rights or fellowship. 
Patriotism substitutes a wider field of ethical ac- 
tivity, and the recognition of a common humanity 
emphasizes and modifies the rights of all men. Sur- 
vivals of the outgrown traits are, however, not diffi- 
cult to find. The English boor who is ever ready 
to " 'eave 'arf a brick " at a stranger, as well as the 
innkeeper of whatever nationality who regards it as 
proper to impose upon the stranger within his gates, 
are not isolated instances. The enlargement of 
altruistic tendencies gradually encompasses the ani- 
mal world, until to-day statutes and customs, socie- 
ties for the protection of animals, and hospitals for 
the care of the decrepit, are regarded as the natural 
provisions of an enlightened community. It is not, 
however, so much the ethical as the anthropological 
interest which sustains the attractiveness of this 
story. The shifting of theory and attitude accord- 
ing to the conception of animal nature that was 
dominant at different times unfolds a suggestive 
panorama. The overweening conceit of man that 
made him regard his world as the centre of the uni- 
verse, and the spot where he dwells as the middle of 
the earth, makes him look upon all the animal crea- 
tion as serving his uses. Hence the degradation of 
animals and the exaltation of man. The primitive 
doctrine of metempsychosis, however, acts just the 
other way. Souls migrate, and human souls may 
pass into animal bodies, and vice versa. Hence, 
animals are to be revered, protected, and held sacred. 
In the orient, this doctrine has been very influential 
and has dictated a humane treatment of the dumb 
creation. But the final step in the recognition of 



330 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



animal rights is the scientific one. Evolution has 
shown that men and animals have much in common, 
and the recognition of this community inevitably re- 
sults in humane treatment. Not only in bodily struc- 
ture, but in mental endowment are animals akin to 
men ; and thus the study of animal psychology gives 
rise to evolutional ethics. Such is the interesting 
story attractively told in this volume. For the ani- 
mal psychology, less commendation can be offered. 
The stories of sagacious doings of animals are val- 
uable only when carefully analyzed and critically 
interpreted. The present collection evidences the 
author's high opinion of the minds of animals, but 
it carries little proof to others. There is too much 
reading in of human motives and ways of thinking 
into animal doings. As a contribution to psychology, 
the volume is weak ; as a contribution to the an- 
thropological history of the relation of man to beast, 
it is alike valuable and readable. 



"Unforseen Tendencies of Democ- 

Modern democracy (Houghton) IS the Collective 

and its tendencies. ,%**, <!/ 

title of a sheaf of thoughtful and well- 
timed essays on topics of current public interest by 
Mr. E. L. Godkin, the accomplished editor of the 
New York " Evening Post." With the author's 
journalistic writings most of our readers are doubt- 
less familiar. In the present volume the opportu- 
nity is given of contrasting Mr. Godkin the caustic 
and somewhat dogmatical editorial writer who draws 
his customary inspiration from such rasping themes 
as Platt and Tammany and the Jingoes and the 
" good Americans," with Mr. Godkin the publicist 
who surveys the phenomena of democracy with the 
serene and philosophical eye of a Lecky or a Tocque- 
ville. So far as we have discovered in these essays, 
Mr. Godkin does not once lose his temper therein 
or yield to his alleged besetting propensity to scold. 
He shows that in his more philosophical moods he 
can view with a lenient and even an indulgent eye 
the ways peculiar to his adopted fellow countrymen. 
More than once he is on the verge of praising us, 
of discerning a clear roseate streak of hope on the 
horizon of our national future. In fine, while the con- 
stant reader of Mr. Godkin's editorials might be led 
to infer therefrom that in the author's opinion this 
country is on the whole in a pretty bad way, such is 
not the impression to be gained from the clear and 
scholarly little volume before us. It bids us hope 
and now we shall all doubtless proceed to do so. 
Mr. Godkin's aim in the present volume is not to 
describe democracy " something which," he says, 
with characteristic modesty, " has been done by abler 
hands than mine " but to point out " some of the 
departures it has made from the ways which its 
earlier promoters expected it to follow." As he 
points out, democracy has pretty generally done pre- 
cisely the unexpected and the unpredicted thing. It 
has not, it is especially encouraging to note, shown 
that inability to correct its mistakes which recent 
writers have assumed. It is not very teachable by 
philosophers and jurists, and most of its legislation 



has hitherto been " mere groping "; but " experience 
is a master from whose chastening rod none can 
escape." To suppose, Mr. Godkin concludes, de- 
mocracy " will not learn through mishaps and mis- 
carriages would be to despair of the human race, 
for it is from suffering or failure that we have got 
most of the good things in civilization. The great, 
perhaps the only, mistake optimists appear to make 
is, as I have said, the mistake of thinking there are 
short cuts to political happiness." Mr. Godkin's 
style is terse and clear, and the papers in this col- 
lection treating such subjects as " Equality," " The 
Nominating System," "The Decline of Legisla- 
tures," " Peculiarities of American Municipal Gov- 
ernment," etc. show both philosophic breadth and 
close special knowledge. 

The careful analyses of critical 
^ thought and the off-hand decisions of 
popular judgment frequently lead to 
opposite results. The sun appears to rotate about 
the earth ; but it can be proved that the reverse is 
true. Thus, " things are not what they seem," and 
this fact, in some of its tendencies and relations, is 
the burden of metaphysics. Especially is this true 
of the ultimate justification and explanation of the 
relations between subject and object, which is the 
service that metaphysics is called upon to perform 
for psychology. Professor Alfred H. Lloyd has 
given this problem a suggestive and timely setting 
in a volume which he entitles " Dynamic Idealism," 
an elementary course in the metaphysics of psychol- 
ogy (McClurg). The dominant tone of the thesis 
is that ideas are not forms but forces ; that active 
relations, not classified elements, make up the con- 
tent of things in their various relations to one an- 
other and to man. The development of this concep- 
tion cannot readily be outlined ; interested readers, 
who are prepared to follow with effort a detailed 
argument, may be referred to the original. Such 
readers, however, are not many ; and in spite of the 
ability in thought and diction which Dr. Lloyd's 
essay abundantly manifests, it in some measure evi- 
dences the defects which have repelled a goodly por- 
tion of possible readers of this field of literature. 
These defects produce the feeling that the wiping 
out of distinctions in which metaphysics so fre- 
quently indulges is neither profitable nor logical. 
The metaphysicians seem to take pleasure in remov- 
ing the wax with which the practical etcher has 
covered his plate, so that when the whole is exposed 
to the acid of critical analysis the lines are over- 
bitten, and light and shade, even the outlines them- 
selves, are lost in a general confusion of black and 
white. And again, these defects produce the feeling 
that metaphysics is not as closely related to science 
and knowledge as it pretends to be. It is so easy to 
prove that things ought or must be so, after you know 
that they are so. This false air of leadership repels. 
It is much as though the dog were to imagine that he is 
leading his master because he constantly runs on just 
a little ahead ; but the wise dog looks back for indi-

cations of the master's proposed route. Here, again, 
it is possible that things are not what they seem. 
It will not do for science to disparage metaphysics, 
nor for metaphysics to disparage science. Each has 
a message for the other ; but it is extremely diffi- 
cult to induce them to speak in the same language. 

After masterly expositions by such 
Growth of the m Professor Seeley, Captain 

British Empire. J rt i 

Mahan, and Professor Goldwm 
Smith, it is disappointing to find the same great sub- 
ject, " The Growth of the British Empire," given an 
inadequate and unscholarly treatment, in a volume 
by Mr. A. T. Story, in the " Stories of the Nations " 
series (Putnam). The writer has set about his task 
conscientiously, yet his narrative rarely rises above 
a commonplace setting forth of a tale already known. 
His work deserves this praise, however, that it brings 
into juxtaposition events which Americans, at least, 
do not often think of as closely related to their own 
colonial history. The author professes to have gone 
to the best sources, but the books he quotes in the 
footnotes suggest that he has little idea of what the 
sources are. His most frequent reference on the 
early colonial period in New England is " Robert- 
son's America." Now, Robertson was a great his- 
torian ; but researches into the history of New En- 
gland did not close with the publication of his book 
in 1777. The same fault appears even more strik- 
ingly in the chapters on India, especially in the 
pages on Dupleix. The author is apparently una- 
ware that the old calumnies against Dupleix, based 
on incidents connected with the surrender of Madras, 
have been silenced by later English historians, not- 
ably by Colonel Malleson ; and that Labourdonnais, 
the rival of the French governor, praised by the 
older school of English writers as the pattern of 
chivalry, was probably less moved by honor in his 
stubborn efforts to thwart Dupleix than by the 
40,000 which he was to receive in case the settle- 
ment was put to ransom. It is not difficult to dis- 
cover where the author got his knowledge of the 
subject. Comparing his pages with those of Mill, 
it is apparent that he has followed Mill sentence by 
sentence with patient fidelity, sometimes taking over 
a sentence bodily with the mere change of a word 
or two. But he has improved on Mill in his char- 
acterizations of the Frenchman's duplicity, perhaps 
prompted by Macaulay's severer language, which, 
in turn, was derived from Orme, a contemporary of 
Dupleix, who for patent reasons failed to under- 
stand him. These instances will serve as illustrations 
of the manner in which this work has been done. 

Mr - Ed g ar Stanton Maclay, whose 
creditable " History of the United 
States Navy " we reviewed at length 
some three or four years ago, has compiled a read- 
able volume of " Reminiscences of the Old Navy " 
(Putnam), from the journals and private papers of 
Captain Edward Trenchard and Rear -Admiral 
Stephen Decatur Trenchard. The records of the 
Trenchards, father and son, cover eighty years of

service in our navy, and are naturally replete with 
episodes and exploits not unworthy of commemora- 
tion, that have escaped the attention of the formal 
historian. Notably interesting are the journal and 
notes of a cruise for the suppression of the slave- 
trade on the African coast, left by the elder Trench- 
ard ; while the copious journals kept by his son when 
on service in the China sea, and during his remark- 
able career as commander of the United States 
cruiser " Rhode Island " throughout the Civil War, 
are well strewn with stirring episodes heretofore 
unrecorded. Among these latter may be mentioned, 
as especially worthy of notice, the chase and cap- 
ture of a Confederate vessel by the " Jamestown," 
the capture of the British ship " Richard O'Brien," 
the adventure of a boat's crew from the " Rhode 
Island " after the sinking of the " Monitor," the cap- 
ture of the Confederate vessels " Venus," " Vixen," 
and " Cronstadt," the several chases after the sup- 
posed " Alabama," and the active participation in 
the assaults on Fort Fisher. Decidedly interesting, 
too, is the elder Trenchard's story of the battle of 
the Peiho Forts the occasion of Tattnal's famous 
sentiment, " Blood is thicker than water." The chief 
value of the book lies, as Mr. Maclay observes, in 
the fact that it is part and parcel of the inside his- 
tory of our navy during the period covered. The 
volume is neatly made, and the edition is limited to 
750 copies. 

Having depicted, in the opening vol- 

ume of his 8erie8 of 8tadies * " The 
Second French Empire," the early 

exiles, mishaps, illusions, and chagrins of the Pris- 
oner of Ham, M. Imbert de Saint- Amand now pro- 
ceeds in Volume II. of the series, entitled " Napo- 
leon III. and his Court " (Scribner), to deal with 
the second or middle phase of Louis Napoleon's ca- 
reer, which includes the period of his joys and tri- 
umphs. Prominent in these pages are the Crimean 
War, the Great Exposition of 1855, the mutual 
visits of the rulers of England and France, and at 
the close of the book, the birth of the ill-starred 
Prince Imperial. M. de Saint-Amand is at once the 
soundest and most brilliant of the popular historians 
of the day, and the present series bids fair to be the 
best and most readable concise account of Napoleon 
III. and his entourage obtainable.

One of the prettiest specimens of 
ornate yet chaste and tasteful book- 
making that has lately fallen in our 
way is Mrs. Anne Hollingsworth Wharton's " Heir- 
looms in Miniature " (Lippincott). Mrs. Wharton's 
idea was a particularly happy and timely one, and it 
has been irreproachably carried out. Her original 
plan was merely to gather together some interesting 
and representative American miniatures, and to ac- 
company each of these with some brief account of the 
person represented. As her task progressed, how- 
ever, so many fresh and interesting facts as to the 
painters and their sitters came to light in the course 
of her correspondence with the possessors of the

original likenesses that her book grew insensibly 
under her hand considerably beyond its projected 
scope and compass. In fine, Mrs. Wharton has given 
us, instead of a sort of mere pictorial catalogue rai- 
sonn&, an entertaining and richly illustrated work, 
brimful of interesting biographical fact and anecdote, 
on American miniature painting. Brief accounts are 
given of the leading artists and their more note- 
worthy patrons ; and Mrs. J. Madison Taylor, of 
Philadelphia, has added a chapter on Miniature 
Painting as an art. There are some ninety illustra- 
tions, including the dainty tinted frontispiece por- 
trait, after Malbone, of Mrs. Alexander Bleecker, 
of New York. In view of the current interest in 
old miniatures and of the promised revival of the 
useful and beautiful art of miniature painting, Mrs. 
Wharton's book is well-timed and will doubtless find 
the favor it deserves.

ical work done by Mr. W. H. Brett, 
of the Cleveland Public Library, in his " Cumula-

second year of this work is represented by the an- 
nual volume for 1897, indexing the contents of one 
hundred well-chosen periodicals. It is a volume of 
635 double-columned pages, which is nearly twice 
the number contained in the volume for 1896. As 
compared with " Poole," this work presents a far 
more minute and searching analysis, although the 
number of periodicals indexed is not so great. 
Indeed, a " Poole " based upon this system would 
prove too voluminous to come within the range of 
the practicable. Mr. Brett gives us entries under 
both authors and subjects, references to reviews of 
books in great number, titles of individual poems, 
and even references to portraits. Dates of birth 
and death are also given with author, and biograph- 
ical subject references. We hope that the public 
will provide this work with sufficient support to 
insure its continuance, for its usefulness can hardly 
be overestimated, and the cost of its preparation 
must be considerable. Hereafter the bi-monthly 
instalments of the " Index " will be cumulative for 
a period of six months, after which a second series 
for the year will begin, but we understand that the 
two will be combined, as at present, in the annual 
volume. _ 

The present time would hardly seem

of a traveller's guide-book to Spain, 
yet such a work has just appeared, and the name 
of Baedeker, the patron-saint of tourists, guarantees 
its superiority to all possible competitors. Further- 
more, if we may not make practical use of it just 
now, we may with great satisfaction add it to the 
library as a reference-work of the most useful sort. 
It is a volume of over six hundred pages, including 
Portugal within its scope, but not, for some inex- 
plicable reason, the Balearic Islands. A Baedeker 
Egypt is also among the publications of this spring, 



although the work in this case is not strictly a new 
one, being rather the compression into a single vol- 
ume of the " Lower Egypt " and " Upper Egypt " 
hitherto known to travellers in the East. Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons import these guide-books 
for the American market. At the same time, we 
may acknowledge the receipt of our old acquaint- 
ance, " The Complete Pocket- Guide to Europe," in 
its latest annual revision. This marvel of compact- 
ness is now published by Mr. W. R. Jenkins, and 
bears upon its title-page the names of Mr. E. C. 
Stedman, who first planned the volume, and Dr. 
Thomas L. Stedman, who yearly brings it up to date. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Statesman's Year Book " has just made its ap- 
pearance for 1898, still edited by Mr. J. Scott Keltie, 
this time with the assistance of Mr. J. P. A. Renwick, 
and published, as heretofore, by the Macmillan Co. The 
special new features of this issue are a revision of the 
navies of the world, a series of diagrams showing the 
course of trade in the leading countries for twenty- 
five years, and a map of West Africa illustrating the 
disputed question of the Niger. Words in praise of 
this publication would be wasted, as every well-informed 
person knows it to be one of the few reference manuals 
that are absolutely indispensable. 

Volume VIII. of the " Harvard Studies in Classical 
Philology" (Ginn) includes the following monographs: 
" The Trial of the Alcmeonidse and the Cleisthenean 
Constitutional Reforms," by Mr. G. W. Botsford; The 
Saliva Superstition in Classical Literature," by Mr. 
F. W. Nicolson; " Greek Grave-Reliefs," by Mr. Richard 
Norton; and "The Origin of Roman Prsenominse," by 
Mr. George D. Chase. No. VI. of the " Cornell Studies 
in Classical Philology " (Macmillan) is devoted to a 
single monograph, being " Studies in Latin Moods and 
Tenses," by Mr. Herbert Charles Elmer. 

Mr. James Hamilton Wylie's "History of England 
under Henry the Fourth " (Longmans) is now made 
complete by the publication of the fourth volume. It 
has been the work of twenty-five years of industrious 
application, and deals with its period as thoroughly and 
as minutely as the period of the Long Parliament is 
dealt with by Dr. Gardiner. The present volume covers 
the last two years (1411-1413) of Henry's reign, and 
only about one- fourth of the contents are needed to com- 
plete the narrative proper. The remaining contents are 
a series of thirty appendices, a glossary of obsolete 
words, and a comprehensive analytical index, extending 
to two hundred pages, to the entire work. 

" School Reading by Grades " is a series of eight num- 
bers, compiled by Mr. James Baldwin, and published by 
the American Book Co. The selections are scrappy, as 
a matter of course, but as school readers go, this series 
exhibits good judgment and literary taste. From the 
same publishers we have " The Story of ^neas," by 
Mr. M. Clarke, in the " Eclectic School Readings," 
and Mr. S. W. Baird's Graded Work in Arithmetic," 
in four parts. They also send us an "Applied Physiol- 
ogy," by Dr. Frank Overtoil, with the chapters on " Nar- 
cotics " that are nowadays incorporated in books of this 
sort, in deference to unwise legislation and an exagger- 
ated phase of popular sentiment.

LITERARY NOTES. 



A volume of dramatic sketches with the title " Cap- 
riccios," by Mr. Louis J. Block, is about to be issued 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

A new edition, with considerable added material, of 
Mr. Benjamin Kidd's " Social Evolution," has just been 
published by the Macmillan Co. 

The Macmillan Co. publish a new edition of the trans- 
lation of M. Zola's " La Debacle," made several years 
ago by Miss Elizabeth Pennell Robins. 

" The Ordeal of Richard Feverel " and " Diana of the 
Crossways " have just been published by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons in their revised edition of the novels of 
Mr. George Meredith. 

A fifth edition of Mr. Louis Heilprin's "Historical 
Reference Book," revised to 1898, is now issued by the 
publishers, Messrs. D. Appleton & Co., as a volume of 
their useful " Concise Knowledge Library." 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have just published 
two " French " volumes in their series of Stories by 
Foreign Authors." Each volume has a portrait frontis- 
piece (Daudet and M. Coppe*e), and contains five or six 
stories by the best modern writers. 

Professor Bury's scholarly edition of Gibbon's " De- 
cline and Fall " is being somewhat deliberately carried 
on to its conclusion. Volumes IV. and V. have just 
appeared, leaving but two more to complete the work. 
The Macmillan Co. are the publishers. 

Mr. W. J. Stillman has resigned as correspondent in 
Rome of the London " Times," and will take up his resi- 
dence in England. He is said to be engaged upon a 
history of Italy from 1812 to the present day, as well 
as several other books. 

Still another old English comedy has been enacted 
by college students. This time it is Dekker's " Shoe- 
maker's Holiday," and the performance was arranged 
by one of the secret societies of Harvard. The play 
was given twice in Cambridge and once in Boston, all 
at the close of last month. 

Dr. Fridtjof Nansen's " Farthest North " (Harper) 
now appears in a one-volume " popular edition," made 
from new plates, and containing sixteen of the more 
important illustrations of the " library edition," besides 
an etched portrait of the author. It makes a volume 
of- nearly seven hundred pages. 

Messrs. Luzac & Co., of London, publish "A Manual 
of Sanskrit Phonetics," by Dr. C. C. Uhlenbeck of Am- 
sterdam, being the author's English translation and re- 
vision of his own " Handboek der Indische Klankleer," 
published in 1894. The original work has, however, 
been considerably augmented. 

" Little Dorrit," " Bleak House," and " Barnaby 
Rudge," each in two volumes, are now ready in the 
" Gadshill " edition of Dickens's works, imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The same publishers 
have added " The Bride of Lammermoor " to their 
" Temple " edition of the Waverley novels, issued in 
connection with Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. of London. 

A new translation of Renan's " The Apostles," by the 
late Joseph Henry Allen, is published by Messrs. Roberts 
Brothers. The " Life of Jesus," and " Antichrist " have 
previously been set to the credit of this singularly com- 
petent translator, and it is to be hoped that his death 
will not interrupt the work of providing the English 
public with a complete version of the seven volumes of 
Renan's "Origines."

pass in elegance and beauty everything in that line ever made

writes in his acknowledgement of the receipt of one of them : 
" The shawl was received yesterday, and I think it very hand- 
some indeed."

JOHN LANE'S NEW BOOKS 



FOURTH EDITION NOW READY OF 

THE ROMANCE OF ZION CHAPEL. By RICHARD LE QALLIENNE. with a cover 

design by Will Bradley. Crown 8vo. $1.50. 

The New York Times says : " Mr. Le Gallienne sketches his character! with a firm hand, and knows how to breathe into them the breath of 
life. . . . The author has not only a brilliant touch and a keen insight, but a wide range of sympathy and an exquisite tenderness." 

Time and the Hour says : " Surely in these brief intimate chapters Mr. Le Gallienue has made something like a very small masterpiece. Such 
writing has a flavor and grace of its own that should make it memorable with the few, while its plain sincerity, its rare kindliness and sympathy, 
must endear it to many." 

The City Press (Philadelphia) says : " ' The Romance of Zion Chapel ' is a novel of rare literary finish and impressive power. It is the novel 
of a poet who can write prose of rare distinction; of an epigrammatist who can flash wit and wisdom in a bewildering profusion of pregnant 
phrases ; of a psychologist who can present objectively his keen, interpenetrative analysis of human motives and human character ; of a painter 
who can project his portraits in relief against a background of hazy chiaroscuro." 

This new book by Mr. Le Galltenne is uniform with " The Quest of the Golden Girl," which is now in its tenth edition. 

FOURTH EDITION IN PREPARATION OF 

POEMS. By STEPHEN PHILLIPS. Crown 8vo. Boards, $1.50. 

To Mr. Stephen Phillips has been awarded by the proprietors of The. Academy (London) a premium of one hundred guineas, 
in accordance with their previously proclaimed intention of making that, and a second gift of fifty guineas, to the writers of 
the two books which should be adjudged worthy to be " crowned " as the most important contributions to the literature of 1897. 

The London Times says : " Mr. Phillips is a poet, one of the half-dozen men of the younger generation whose writings contain the indefinable 
quality which makes for permanence." 

The London Academy says : " How could language express more ? It has an almost physical effect upon the reader, in the opening of the eyes 
and the dilation of the heart." 

JUST READY. 

ADMIRALS ALL, and Other Poems. By HENRY NEWBOLT. wrappers. Fcapsvo. 35c. 

In a very little while this book has sold 6000 copies in England. 

The Westminster Gazette (London) says : " Looking back to recent achievements in the same line, and including even Mr. Kipling's, we do not 
know where to find anything better after its own kind than his ballad of ' Drake's Drum.' " 

The Spectator (London) says : " To the band of modern ballad- writers a new recruit is always most welcome. It is therefore with the greatest 
possible pleasure that we notice the delightful little collection of ballads which Mr. Newbolt publishes under the title of 'Admirals All.' Mr. 
Newbolt has done a notable thing. He has managed to write ballads full of ring and go, and full also of patriotic feeling, without imitating 
Mr. Rudyard Kipling. . . . 'Admirals All 'is practically Mr. Stevenson's charming essay on 'The Old Admirals' put into ballad form. Mr. Newbolt 
has improved on the essay, and given us a poem which could be sung by sailors all the world over."

FELIX GRAS'S NEW ROMANCE. 

THE TERROR. 

A Romance of the French Revolution. Translated by Mrs. 

CATHARINE A. JANVIER. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. (In Press.) 
The new romance relates the history of the year for which Pascalet was 
absent, and of some years more. It describes the sufferings and persecu- 
tion of the heroine Adeline as an "aristocrat," thus furnishing a point 
of view of the Revolution which is the opposite of that presented in 
" The Reds of the Midi." The central motif of the romance, developed 
with singular sympathy by the author, is the picture of a young girl's 
feelings when thrown into the vortex of the French Revolution. The 
action passes for a time in Paris, and then in Avignon. 

KRONSTADT. 

A Romance. By MAX PEMBERTON. Illustrated. 12mo, 

cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Pemberton has written a stirring romance of love, adventure, and 
political intrigue, and no reader who begins hi* tale will be content to 
leave it unfinished. The interior of the gloomy fortress of Kronstadt, 
the Baltic, the Finnish islands, and London, furnish the background for 
swiftly moving scenes which are tense with suspended interest, with the 
power of love, and with the stress of peril. Although a story of the 
present day, the pulse of adventure and romance throbs as strongly in 
these pages as in a mediaeval tale. 

ARACHNE. 

An Egyptian Romance. By Dr. GEORO EBF.KS, author 
of "Uardo," "Joahaa," "An Egyptian Princess," etc. 
Uniform edition. In two volumes. 16mo. Per vol., 
cloth, 75 cents ; paper, 40 cents. 

A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES 

NAVY, 

From 1775 to 1898. By EDQAR STANTON MACLAY, A.M. 
With Technical Revision by Lieutenant ROY C. SMITH, 
U. S. N. New edition, revised and enlarged, with new 
chapters and several new illustrations. In two volumes. 
8vo. Per vol., cloth, $3.50. 

This edition has been brought down to Dewey's victory at Man- 
illa. Some of the most important additions are the chapters Cruising 
after Slavers, Attack on the Wyoming, and Sea Power in the Civil War. 
Some of the other material incorporated is an account of Commander 
(now Commodore) Schley's arctic relief expedition, the sequel to the 
sinking of the Monitor, a fuller account of the Apia disaster, the last 
appearance of the Merrimac in Hampton Roads, from material prepared 
for the author by Rear-Admiral Thomas Stowell Phelps, the latest de- 
velopments in gun and ship building, an outline of the formation and 
development of our marine, medical, and pay departments, an explana- 
tion of the Cuban complications, an account of the Maine disaster and 
our relations with Spain, and a description of the equipment and mobi- 
lization of the navy in the winter and spring of 1898 down to May 1. There 
are several new and typical pictures of vessels prominent in our naval 
operations, and also new maps showing the scenes of naval operations. 
Without dwelling upon many other important new features, reference 
may be made to the revision of the list of naval vessels, which now 
includes our new purchases. The War of 1812 is now ended in Vol. I. 
The number of pages in each volume has been greatly increased. 

THE STORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 

By ALFRED T. STORY. A new volume in the Library of 
Useful Stories. 16mo, cloth, 40 cents. 

READY SHORTLY. 

EVELYN INNES. 

A Story. By GEORGE MOORE, author of "Esther Wa- 
ters," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

Mr. Moore's comparative silence for the last few years has been due 
to his preoccupation with his most serious and important work which 
is now given to the public. This novel is a masterly analysis of a conflict 
between art and the world on one side and religion upon the other. The 
theme is developed with a penetrating insight into motives, a grasp of 
character, and a mastery of literary technique which make "Evelyn 
I lines " a notable book. The action of the novel passes in large part in 
London and Paris. It is a story of the present day, characterized by a 
vivid perception of the doubts and complex conditions of modern life. 
The musical motif which has so large a part in the development of the 
story is interwoven with others which in their unfolding show a rare 
subtlety and power of expression. 



OUT = DOOR BOOKS. 

THE ART OF TAXIDERMY. 

By JOHN ROWLEY, Chief of the Department of Taxi- 
dermy in the American Museum of Natural History. 
Illustrated. 12mo, cloth. 

Mr. Rowley has introduced new features into the art which have not 
been described in print before, and his book represents the latest ad- 
vances in taxidermy as an art and aa a science. He takes a hunting 
party to the Canadian woods in his opening chapter, and gives a series 
of vivid pictures of actual field work. This is followed by a series of 
careful explanations of the proper treatment of animals, large and 
small, of birds, and heads. The many lovers of outdoor sport who are 
interested as amateurs in the various phases of taxidermy will find their 
requirements fully met, while to professional taxidermists this impor- 
tant and comprehensive work will be indispensable. It is elaborately 
illustrated.

WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 

It is not often that the closing days of a great 
career compel the grief and sympathy of the 
whole civilized world. There are so many great 
men in so many departments of human activity, 
while the interests of observers are so special- 
ized and varied, that one must occupy an extra- 
ordinarily commanding position to exact from 
all classes the tribute of attention, even under 
circumstances that make unusual demands upon 
the sympathies. That something like this tri- 
umph was achieved by Mr. Gladstone is evi- 
dent from the widespread eagerness with which 
the course of his fatal disease, and the pathetic 
sufferings attendant upon it, have been followed 
by all kinds of readers, and the abundance of 
eulogy that has been set free by the news of his 
final release. The last remaining member of 
the remarkable group of men fortuitously asso- 
ciated by the year of their common birth, his 
popular renown was perhaps greater than that 
of any of the others, although it may hardly be 
doubted that the verdict of " them who know," 
as registered by the posterity of the twentieth 
century, will assign to Lincoln a higher place 
in the making of history, to Tennyson and Dar- 
win higher places in the development of thought. 
But just now we are so impressed with the tow- 
ering personality of the English statesman, and 
feel so keenly the loss of his leadership, that 
the critical sense becomes deadened, and the 
temptation is well-nigh irresistible to join in the 
journalistic chorus of praise in which his life- 
work is now being reviewed. 

To the critic determined upon unrelieved 
eulogy there is, indeed, in the career of Glad- 
stone material enough to inspire the most slug- 
gish to panegyric, achievement to the credit of 
the man himself and to humanity at large suf- 
ficient to give pause to the voice of detraction 
and permit the laurel-wreath of fame to rest 
unquestioned upon his brow. The memory of 
his eloquence, the devotion inspired by his lead- 
ership, his splendid humanitarian endeavor in 
behalf of oppressed peoples, his unexampled 
mastery of financial and other administrative 
problems, his instinct for righteousness in both 
public and private life, his unswerving devotion 
to the ideals which seemed to him worthy, how- 



344 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



ever mistaken some of them may have been, his 
almost complete exemption from the human 
failings that so often add a touch of pettiness 
to the lives of the most exalted, all these 
things offer the strongest possible temptation 
to deal with his memory in the spirit of the old 
adage that bids us speak nothing but good con- 
cerning the dead. In this case, at least, there 
is no danger of providing a new illustration of 
the Shakespearian lines, 

"The evil that men do lives after them, 
The good is oft interred with their bones." 

The danger is rather that eulogy will become 
so indiscriminate as to make claims for Glad- 
stone that cannot possibly be justified, that his 
intellectual defects will be for the time forgot- 
ten in the generous glow of feeling with which 
his career is commemorated. 

The public life of Gladstone will receive its 
final appraisement from the impartial historian 
far on in the coming century. It is safe to say 
that this appraisement will be far removed 
from the laudatory extreme of the present day 
when the sense of his loss is fresh in our hearts, 
and from the extreme of dispraise which his 
famous volte-face of 1886 then evoked from 
most of the men among his contemporaries 
where opinions had real weight. That his plan 
for the settlement of the Irish agitation would, 
if successfully carried out, have sown the seeds 
of disintegration in the Constitution of the 
United Kingdom, we firmly believe ; but the 
violence with which he was assailed for his 
advocacy of that plan, and the passionate way 
in which his motives were then impugned, did 
little credit to his opponents, and afforded a 
melancholy illustration of the extremes to which 
the partisan spirit may pervert the judgment. 
The degree and quality of Gladstone's states- 
manship remain yet to be weighed in the impar- 
tial scales of dispassionate criticism ; and this 
it is no more possible to do at the present time 
than it would have been ten years ago, for the 
balance which would then have tipped far too 
much on the one side would just now incline 
far too much upon the other. Meanwhile, we 
may express the opinion that the estimate made 
by Matthew Arnold not long before his death, 
and published in one of the monthly reviews, 
will in the end prove to have come as near as 
any contemporary estimate to the judgment of 
posterity. It has been too much the fashion to 
speak slightingly of Arnold's judgment in 
extra-literary matters, but his memory will in 
time come to its own in this regard, and it will 
be understood upon how many matters of polit- 



ical and religious significance he held the scales 
of even-handed justice. 

The twentieth century will not find it alto- 
gether easy to account for Gladstone's hold 
upon the nineteenth century. It will have to 
accept the fact as unquestionable, but the ex- 
planation will prove puzzling. He will be 
remembered as a Great Commoner, somewhat 
as the elder Pitt is now remembered, and men 
will turn to his speeches to penetrate the secret 
of his power. But in those speeches they will 
find little to remind them of the eloquence with 
which Pitt appeals to us even now from the 
printed page. They will find, rather, a diffuse 
and common style, often weighty in matter, but 
without wings to soar. The irony of the familiar 
phrase, litera scripta manet, will be deeply felt 
when these dull periods are contrasted with the 
tradition of their framer's eloquence. For 
Gladstone was, beyond doubt, one of the most 
eloquent speakers who have ever moved legis- 
latures. But to the student of a hundred years 
from now, while the written word will indeed 
remain for his examination, the moral fervor 
that made the word vital when spoken will have 
been long since chilled, and the personality that 
made the word impressive will have become but 
a dim memory. How marked is the contrast 
between the case of Gladstone and the case of 
Burke. The ineffectual oratory of the eight- 
eenth-century statesman had no charm for the 
sense, but the speeches that he delivered to 
empty benches have taken their place for all 
time in the literature of the world. Delivered 
to inattentive ears, the depth of their political 
wisdom and the gorgeous embroidery of their 
style have made them an inexhaustible source 
of inspiration to all succeeding generations. 
The speeches of Gladstone, on the other hand, 
for half a century compelled the attention of 
crowds of eager listeners, but their power to 
sway died with the breath that gave them life, 
and the statesman of the future will turn to 
them neither for guidance nor for inspiration. 

What is true of Gladstone's speeches con- 
sidered as literary productions is also true of 
the great mass of other printed material fur- 
nished forth by his busy pen. It is with regard 
to this phase of his activity more than any other 
that the day-laborers of the press, as Schopen- 
hauer calls journalists, have shown a total lack 
of critical discrimination. They have simply 
taken for granted that so great a man must be 
great in whatever he undertakes, and have en- 
tertained and spread abroad honestly enough, 
no doubt the notion that Gladstone was a

THE DIAL,

distinguished writer and a profound thinker. 
Nothing could be farther removed from the 
truth than this opinion. One may search his 
voluminous writings in vain for anything like 
high distinction in expression, while scholars in 
most of the special fields into which he some- 
times made excursions have almost always re- 
fused to take him seriously. When they were 
occasionally persuaded so to take him, as in the 
case of his famous controversy with Huxley, 
the result was much to his discomfiture. He 
was hardly more fortunate in his Homeric 
studies than in his championship of an old- 
fashioned theology against natural science and 
the higher criticism. He possessed a vast store 
of minute information upon historical and ec- 
clesiastical subjects, but even the great length 
of his years did not bring the philosophic mind 
in the best sense, and he always displayed an 
extraordinary instinct for the exploration of 
" blind leads " in theological and humanistic 
discussion. These diversions of his literary 
activity, as distinguished from his really solid 
work in the fields of financial, administrative, 
and political science, are for the most part 
hopelessly futile ; they have produced no more 
than a few ripples in the current of serious 
thought, and they have no antiseptic of style to 
protect them from decay. 

A man who wrote so much as Gladstone, yet 
in his writing could never attain to any higher 
literary qualities than a certain sincerity of pur- 
pose and quiet dignity, whose manner was ha- 
bitually diffuse and frequently commonplace, 
could hardly be expected to display a delicate 
critical sense in dealing with literature in gen- 
eral. Omnivorous reader that he was, it was 
evidently the matter of books that he prized 
rather than the form of its expression. One 
never knew what kind of a new book would 
receive his approval, and be launched upon the 
sea of an ephemeral fame by one of his famous 
post-cards. He never outgrew the didactic ideal 
of literature, and the didacticism of a book, in 
order to win his favor, must conform pretty 
closely to a rather narrow set of traditional lines. 
Poetry, to be really great, must have fairly 
definite religious implications, and the norm of 
these implications must not depart very far 
from the standards of the Church of England. 
His interest in the Homeric epic, for example, 
derived much of its strength from fancied anal- 
ogies between the Hellenic and Hebraic ideals, 
and he displayed all his ingenuity in seeking 
to establish such a synthesis. A typical pas- 
sage from one of his essays speaks of "the 



solid and consistent wisdom which can feel no 
other firm foundation in the heart of man than 
the Gospel Revelation, without which, even 
while we feel the poet to be an enchanter, we 
cannot accept and trust him as a guide ; and 
of which Wordsworth is an example unequaled 
probably in our age and unsurpassed in any 
age preceding ours." Gladstone's essential 
attitude toward literature is expressed, and its 
limitations clearly emphasized, in the words 
above quoted, and in the elaboration of their 
thought which follows. 

" The highest functions of the human being stand in 
such intimate relations to one another that the patent 
want of any one of them will commonly prevent the 
attainment of perfection in any other. The sense of 
beauty enters into the highest philosophy, as in Plato. 
The highest poet most be a philosopher, accomplished 
like Dante, or intuitive like Shakespeare. But neither 
the one nor the other can now exist in separation from 
that conception of the relations between God and man, 
that new standard and pattern of humanity, which Chris- 
tianity has supplied. It is true, indeed, that much of 
what it has indelibly impressed upon the imagination 
and understanding, the heart and life of man, may be 
traceable and even prominent in those who individually 
disown it. The splendor of these disappropriate gifts 
in particular cases may be among the very greatest of 
the signs and wonders appointed for the trial of faith. 
Yet there is always something in them to show that they 
have with them no source of positive permanent vitality ; 
that the branch has been torn from the tree, and that 
its life is on the wane." 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, May IS, 1898. 

All our plans and schemes are " gang agley." We 
have no time for publishing books; and if we had, we 
should find nobody willing to buy them. Your " little 
affair " with Spain has set everything topsy-turvy. Our 
newspapers are now having their innings. All that we 
could do was to meet at a big restaurant and have a 
dinner. There we seemed to cheer up a bit; but Mr. 
James Bryce, the Chairman, did not give us much chance 
to lay any unction to our souls. He thought things 
looked bad for book publishers and booksellers, and the 
only way ont, so far as his inexperienced mind could 
suggest, was by way of publishing books cheaper. Well, 
we all knew that. It was not news, and it did n't help 
us much to digest the dinner. But a good deal has been 
written and talked since the speech was given. What 
it will end in must be left to the imagination. 

I have lately been told of several instances of authors 
of the third and fourth class who vent their spleen on 
the publishers who refuse their manuscripts, by writing 
letters in reply to the refusal note, of a most insulting 
character. Fortunately for these authors, the letters 
they write are private, and the publisher has perforce 
to throw them into the waste-paper basket with an 
amused smile. But it occurs to me that a Publishers' 
Association, such as we have in this country, ought to 
have such letters placed before it, and the writers of 
them noted for future reference. Only to-day I saw a 



346 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



letter from a lady novelist to a publisher, which, had it 
been printed, would have placed that lady in a very 
uncomfortable position. It was written in the most 
insulting tone, and wound up with a threat that she 
would hold the publisher up to the obloquy of all her 
friends. Commend me to the disappointed lady novelist 
for politeness, and the amenities of a well-bred society. 

The new edition of Jane Austen's novels, about which 
I wrote to you a few weeks ago, is now definitely an- 
nounced, in prospectus form, as " The Winchester Edi- 
tion," to consist of ten volumes of large crown octavo 
size. The first two, containing " Sense and Sensibility," 
will be issued on June 8, and will be succeeded by the 
remaining stories, in chronological order, two volumes 
each month. " Lady Susan " and " The Watsons," says 
the prospectus, " will not find a place in the Winchester 
edition, for neither, the publisher takes leave to imagine, 
would have been included in such an edition by the au- 
thoress herself." I have little doubt that this series of 
Miss Austen's novels will be accepted by all lovers of 
good and beautiful books, as the final edition. A special 
advantage lies in the fact that readers may buy the 
novels separately; and the price of five shillings a vol- 
ume is low enough to tempt almost everybody. 

The late Lewis Carroll's books seem, in their first 
editions, to be bringing record prices at the auction rooms. 
The other day, a copy of The Garland of Rachel " sold 
for 12 10s.! But there happens to be something spe- 
cial about this volume, which entitles it to a biblio- 
grapher's respect. The Rev. H. Daniel, Fellow and 
Bursar of Worcester College, has a private printing- 
press of his own, and this copy of Lewis Carroll's book is 
one of the earliest productions of that press. Moreover, 
it is one of but thirty-two copies printed ; and a curious 
point to note is that among these thirty-two copies there 
are eighteen different title-pages. In 1881, when the 
volume was printed, it sold for four guineas. 

The Rev. Stopford A. Brooke has long been engaged 
on a study of the works of Robert Browning, similar to 
his work on Tennyson. The substance of the Tennyson 
volume, and the groundwork of the Browning book, 
were both delivered as lectures at Bedford Chapel, 
during Mr. Brooke's ministry there. The Browning 
volume is so far proceeded with that the publishers ex- 
pect to be able to issue it next October. 

Our new weekly is, I hear, to be called " The Satur- 
day Chronicle," and will have an influential contributor 
is the person of the Rt. Hon. James Bryce, M.P. What 
it intends to do exactly, I pannot say ; but, no doubt, its 
promoters believe that there is room for another, where 
" The Spectator " has succeeded so well. 

Two books which are to be published next month will 
deserve your careful consideration. One is " True 
Heart," by F. Breton; and the other is a novel of West 
Indian life by Haldam McFall, the son of Mrs. Sarah 
Grand. Both books will be issued here by Mr. Grant 
Richards; but I believe one of your publishers has ar- 
ranged for their appearance on your side of the water. 
Mr. Eden Phillpott's Children of the Mist " is passing 
through the press, as is also a new story by Mr. Robert 
Buchanan to be called "Father Anthony." A story 
which I understand Mr. David Christie Murray consid- 
ers to be the best he has so far written, is to be pub- 
lished here by Mr. C. A. Pearson. Its title is to be 
" Despair's Last Journey." 

The "Kailyard" books are waning in popularity. 
Where once they sold in their tens of thousands, they 
now, so I hear, sell in tens of hundreds. Well, they had 



a good time while it lasted. Whether or no their authors 
have enough left in them to make a second " boom " 
remains to be seen. 

Mr. Le Gallienne's " Romance of Zion Chapel " has 
been what one might call a literary success. The story 
has been rather well received by the critics. The trouble 
is that the reading world are not bothering their heads 
about it much here. I am sorry for this, because the 
book deserves strong consideration from the guardians 
of the Nonconformist conscience. It must be that these 
people do n't read much, after all, unless it be detective 
stories and divorce cases. 

Carlyle's " Sartor Resartus " is to have an illustrator 
in the person of Mr. Sullivan, the English artist. The 
volume is to be one of the first books of the coming 
season, and ought to be quite an interesting item. 

I am asked by Messrs. Duckworth & Co. to make a 
small correction. In one of my previous letters, I an- 
nounced that these publishers were about to issue a new 
edition of Butler's " Lives of the Saints." This is not so. 
The series of books which they will issue is to bear the 
general title, " The Saints," and to consist of an entirely 
new set of " Lives." The general editor is M. Henri 
Joly, and the English translations are to be revised by 
the Rev. Father Tyrrell. The volumes already arranged 
for are " The Psychology of the Saints," by Henri Joly; 
S. Augustine," by Ad. Hatzfeld; S. Clotilda," by 
Godefrey Kurth; "S. Vincent de Paul," by Prince 
Emmanuel de Broglie. 

There is a noticeable absence of the " fad " in our 
social and literary life. I cannot report any single new 
" fad " or " mode." All these are apparently " off " for 
the present. We are taking things less seriously than 
we were wont to do. Even ourselves, we are beginning 
to look upon as being slightly humbugs. It would seem 
that " fads " never appear when the spirit of true humor 
is abroad. Not that we have precipitated anything great 
in humor lately; but we are enjoying ourselves a little 
more heartily, and amusing one another with theories 
about wars and politics and ministries and the rest. I 
have come to the conclusion that there is nothing like 
an international imbroglio to stir the world up to a bit 
of genuine fun. At the same time, I must confess the 
young decadents and the rest were fun enough in their 
way, but one saw it in the funny way only when the 
young gentlemen gave us a chance, which was not 
often, they were so persistently serious in their poses.

ANTIQUITY. 

He spoke to us of Egypt in her prime; 
He showed us pictures of the rock-hewn kings, 
And Memnon's hoary bulk that no more sings 
His greeting to the morning sun. The time 
Slipped back through thirty centuries dim with rime, 
And mist that veils the dawn of human things, 
Until we felt the awe the great past brings 
To us who dwell in this unstoried clime. 

And then he paused and turned; the night was torn 
With flying clouds, but once there gleamed a star; 
And he:'" Lo, that dim light saw Egypt born; 
Before it, all earth's ages moments are, 
And all her greatness but a grain of sand."

A COTTXTRYMAX OF HAMLET 
UPON SHAKESPEARE.* 



There is something impressive in the circum- 
stance that now, three hundred years after the 
first appearance of " The Tragedy of Hamlet, 
Prince of Denmark," a work of more than 
eight hundred pages upon Shakespeare by a 
Danish critic should be translated into the En- 
glish language. " Hamlet," says Dr. Brandes, 
" has given the name of Denmark a world-wide 
renown." " Denmark," he continues, " has 
produced several men of note Tycho Brahe, 
Thorvaldsen, and Hans Christian Andersen, 
but none of them has attained a hundredth part 
of Hamlet's fame." When the announcement 
was made, two or three years ago, that the dis- 
tinguished Danish critic had completed a com- 
prehensive work upon Shakespeare and that it 
was to be translated into English, some hope 
was entertained that so accomplished a writer 
would give us a survey of the subject at once 
large, stimulating, and exact. Of the welcome 
that would be accorded to a masterly treatment 
of this great subject, there can be no doubt. 
Dr. Brandes's notable book upon the " Chief 
Tendencies of the Literature of the Nineteenth 
Century " was a brilliant rather than a pro- 
found or exact work. But it is now well-nigh 
a quarter of a century since that work was 
given to the world, and it was hoped that, in 
undertaking to deal with the greatest and the 
most difficult subject in modern literature, Dr. 
Brandes would not repeat the mistakes of his 
youth. It now appears that these high hopes 
were not warranted. Dr. Brandes has doubt- 
less learned many things in the past quarter- 
century, but with all his getting he has not got 
wisdom. His book has the distinction of being 
the greatest literary disappointment of the 
period. There remains for us the somewhat 
ungrateful task of deriving such instruction as 
we may from the study of so brilliant a failure. 
A failure in the world's sense which may 
perhaps be the sense of the author too it cer- 
tainly is not. To the reader of Shakespeare it 
is interesting, almost captivating ; and no doubt 
it will have a great sale. But it is an unsound 
book, and, as such, can bring the author no 
lasting reputation. 

Superficially, the book makes a favorable

Brandes. In two volumes. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



impression. It is beautifully and correctly 
printed, and its contents are made easy of ac- 
cess by chapter-headings and head-lines. The 
task of the translators has been performed, on 
the whole, uncommonly well. There is, how- 
ever, a noticeable inequality, the part done by 
Mr. Archer being distinctly the best. There 
are lapses and oversights, instances of false 
syntax, failures to verify citations from acces- 
sible English sources ; and the index is inade- 
quate. Perhaps the most grotesque example 
of failure to identify a quotation is to be found 
at page 160, Vol. II., where a well-known pas- 
sage in Hamlet's advice to the players is taken 
over directly from the Danish in such a way 
that its author would repudiate it. 

At the very beginning of his book, and again 
at the very end, Dr. Brandes distinctly states its 
purpose, which is to acquaint us with Shake- 
speare the man. His true life is incorporated 
in his writings : " It is entirely our own fault 
if we know nothing whatever about him." But, 
Dr. Brandes is careful to add, in order to dis- 
tinguish the personality that rises from his 
works, these must be read " with an open, recep- 
tive mind, with sanity of judgment and simple 
susceptibility to the power of genius." These 
excellent principles are laid down in the very 
last paragraph of the book. At the beginning 
also he speaks to like purpose : 

" It is true that we possess in Shakespeare's Sonnets 
a group of poems which bring as more distinctly into 
touch with his personality than any of his other works. 
But to determine the value of the Sonnets as autobio- 
graphical documents requires not only historical knowl- 
edge but critical instinct and tact, since it is by no means 
self-evident that the poet is, in a literal sense, speaking 
in his own name " (pp. 5 and 6, Vol. I.). 

To Dr. Brandes's treatment of the Sonnets 
let us accordingly turn in order to test his own 
adequacy in the qualities which he himself indi- 
cates as essential to the Shakespearian critic, 
openness of mind, sanity of judgment, critical 
tact, and historical knowledge. He begins by 
committing himself unreservedly to the theory 
that William Herbert, afterwards Earl of Pem- 
broke, was the youth to whom the greater num- 
ber of the Sonnets are addressed. The argu- 
ment by which he supports this conclusion is 
scarcely so firmly linked as circumstantial evi- 
dence should be. For example, the date of the 
first friendship of Shakespeare with Herbert is 
fixed as 1598, on the strength of some Latin 
verses by Francis Meres which are supposed to 
have suggested some expressions in Sonnet 55. 
Meres, after quoting Ovid and Horace, enu- 
merates, in imitation of them, some of the

agencies that will succumb to Time sooner than 
the lines of Sidney, Spenser, Shakespeare, and 
the rest of the English poets. Among these 
agencies are " Mars : ferrum : flamma." In 
Sonnet 55, which is evidently written upon the 
text of the famous " exegi monumentum " of 
Horace, occur the lines : 

" Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn 
The living record of your memory." 

Meres would have sent Shakespeare a copy of 
his book ; Shakespeare would have read his 
own praises there, and would have paid Meres 
the compliment of imitating his indifferent 
Latin verses. For it is not to be supposed that 
a genius like Shakespeare could have hit upon 
such recondite figures as those of " Mars his 
sword " and " war's quick fire " without being 
helped to them by an ass like Meres ! Yet this 
is the sort of thing that Dr. Brandes expressly 
declares to be conclusive proof. But this is 
not all : granting that this is proved, nothing 
is proved with reference to the date of the 
friendship in question, which is referred to as 
"new," not in Sonnet 55 but in Sonnet 56, 
which, Dr. Brandes asserts, " must date from 
about the same time." Thus, by proving that 
Sonnet 55 contains a commonplace or two re- 
sembling something that an eulogist of Shake- 
speare wrote in 1598, it is demonstrated that 
another Sonnet, which chances to stand next in 
the printed book, must refer to a circumstance 
occurring in the year 1598 ! To point out the 
numerous fallacies that grin from every loop- 
hole of this argument is an exercise in logic 
which I leave to the ingenious reader. 

Dr. Brandes next plunges into the unsavory 
account of the unclean tripartite relation that 
existed, as he and others most powerfully and 
potently believe, between these two friends and 
Mistress Mary Fitton. In 1601 this Mistress 
Fitton gave birth to a child whose paternity 
Herbert (now Earl of Pembroke) acknowl- 
edged, " but utterly renounceth all marriage." 
This, according to Dr. Brandes, is " evidently " 
the love-affair which forms the subject of 
Shakespeare's Sonnets. This Mistress Fitton, 
then, is to be accepted as the " Dark Lady " of 
the Sonnets. And upon what evidence ? Abso- 
lutely none except such as is furnished by her 
relation with Pembroke, who had numerous 
other relations of the same kind, this chancing 
to be the one that became notorious at this par- 
ticular time. We do not even know that her 
complexion was dark ! Lady Newdegate, who 
best knows the supposed portraits of her, thinks 
them to represent " a fair red-and-white girl 



with brown hair." Yet Dr. Brandes makes 
her play the woman's part and that most 
mischievously in Shakespeare's life, and is 
positive in his conviction that she is not only the 
Dark Lady of the Sonnets, but also the " black" 
Rosaline of " Love's Labor's Lost," the Rosa- 
line of " Romeo and Juliet," and Cleopatra. 
After devoting many pages to the unsavory 
gossip about her, and to the various references 
in the sonnets to the " woman coloured ill," 
and the rest, while offering not a particle of 
proof and little enough of strong probability r 
he concludes : 

" It has been established, as clearly as anything of 
this kind can be established without the direct evidence 
of contemporaries, that Mrs. Mary Fitton and the Dark 
Lady were one and the same person." 

Compare with this the statement of the case 
lately made by Dr. Furnivall at the close of 
his comment on Lady Newdegate's book : 

" The conclusion of the whole matter then is, that 
though the suggestion of William Herbert and Mary 
Fitton as the man and the woman of the Sonnets is the 
best yet made, there is nothing like proof or good evi- 
dence that they are the folk we want, and there is at least 
much evidence against them." (From " The Theatre," 
1st December, 1897.) 

I have gone into this, first, because it gives 
a fair example of Dr. Brandes's notion of his- 
torical evidence ; and, secondly, because this 
Dark-Lady theory colors his entire interpreta- 
tion of Shakespeare's character and works. 
Possessed by this and other theories equally 
airy in foundation, Dr. Brandes frequently 
overcharges his colors, does violence to the 
facts, or disregards inconvenient evidence. 
Thus, he insists, at the close of his interesting 
study of " Antony and Cleopatra," that the 
dramatist puts Cleopatra, after Antony's death, 
" in a much more unfavorable light " than does 
Plutarch, purposely intending a "home-thrust" 
at his bete noire, the Dark Lady. Plutarch 
represents Cleopatra's pretended clinging to 
life as a mere feint to elude the vigilance of 
Octavius. Shakespeare suppresses this " his- 
torical explanation " of her conduct, says Dr. 
Brandes, in order to disparage her ; for him 
" she is ever the quintessence of the she-animal 
in woman." Had Dr. Brandes not been wedded 
to the Dark-Lady theory, he might have seen 
that Shakespeare permits us to infer the " his- 
torical explanation " of Cleopatra's conduct. 
It is bad criticism to say of a dramatist that he 
suppresses a motif that he distinctly implies. 
Dr. Brandes has studied his Shakespeare to 
little purpose if he has not learned that it is far 
from being the great dramatist's way to cross 



1898.]

every t and dot every i for us. Indeed, the 
incomparable succinctness and economy of force 
that distinguish this play above all others are 
lost, so far as here appears, upon the Danish 
critic. Let anyone without prepossession com- 
pare Plutarch's narrative, in the translation of 
Sir Thomas North, with the play, and judge 
whether Shakespeare is disparaging Cleopatra, 
or whether he is not, on the contrary, distinctly 
ennobling his historical model. He emphasizes 
her motherhood by making her delay her death 
in order, if possible, to obtain the kingdom for 
her son. He dignifies her by making her the 
object of the unselfish devotion of Dolabella. 
In this episode, by the way, Shakespeare has an- 
ticipated Browning's exquisite fancy of "queen- 
worship." We feel that a woman capable of 
inspiring such affection cannot be all unworthy. 
Never was the charm and sacredness of " das 
Ewig-Weibliche " expressed with such heart- 
piercing pathos as in Cleopatra's dying words : 

" Peace, peace! 

Dost them not see my baby at my breast, 
That sucks the nurse asleep ?" 

Yet all these master-strokes are lost upon Dr. 
Brandes. He complains that in " Macbeth " all 
is too clear, " Nothing lies concealed between 
the lines. . . . It is a rich highly moral melo- 
drama." Perhaps it might have been as well 
for Dr. Brandes, and even for his public, had 
he postponed his ambitious work upon Shake- 
speare until he had dropped his plummet a little 
deeper into " Macbeth " and had trained his 
eye to catch the flashes of suggestion in " An- 
tony and Cleopatra." 

The truth seems to be that Dr. Brandes is a 
heavy-handed critic, as signally lacking in crit- 
ical tact as we have seen him to be lacking in 
sanity of judgment and openness of mind. After 
this, one would like to ascribe to him the re- 
maining quality which he rightly deems essen- 
tial to the critic, historical knowledge. Yet 
no one can be said to possess historical knowl- 
edge whose attitude toward facts is so habitu- 
ally careless as his. To point out and exemplify 
all the inaccuracies of statement and consequent 
or causative errors of judgment in this extended 
work would require a volume. These inaccu- 
racies of statement are generally minute, it is 
true ; none the less, the whole book is worm- 
eaten with them. 

Dr. Brandes makes the most of Shakespeare's 
" pessimism," " bitterness," sickness of heart, 
disgust with life, " misanthropy " and " mis- 
ogyny," during the third period of his author- 
ship, the period to which are ascribed " An- 



tony and Cleopatra," " Coriolanus," " Troilus 
and Cressida," and " Timon of Athens." To 
the less inspired and more depressing of these 
plays he gives disproportionate attention. Thus, 
to " Troilus and Cressida " he devotes nearly 
three times as much space as to " Macbeth " 
or " King Lear "; to " Coriolanus " twice as 
much, and even to " Timon " considerably 
more than to either " Macbeth " or " Lear." 
This is because he finds more of Shakespeare's 
" personality " in the more " pessimistic " 
plays. His method of getting at this person- 
ality is a simple one. He merely selects the 
character to which it suits him to ascribe the 
utterances of the author's personal mood. In 
"Troilus and Cressida," for example, this char- 
acter is the " scandalous buffoon " Thersites. 
It is difficult to characterize this method of 
criticism by the use of adjectives sufficiently 
polite. 

I have given very few of the scores of exam- 
ples that might be cited in exemplification of 
these strictures, but I have said enough to show 
how baseless is the claim that this is a book 
distinguished by " German thoroughness." Its 
two damning defects are inaccuracy of detail 
and grandiose disregard of the relations uni- 
versally demanded by reasonable beings be- 
tween premises and conclusions. By the method 
of proof here adopted, any proposition can be 
demonstrated according to the mood of the au- 
thor. It would scarcely be a parody of Dr. 
Brandes's method were we to contend that 
Shakespeare must have been haunted by a tor- 
turing prevision of the vagaries of Danish crit- 
icism when he made the Queen in " Hamlet " 
exclaim : 

" How cheerfully on the false trail they cry ! 
O this is counter, you false Danish dogs." 

The fact that this book is, considering its 
size and comprehensiveness, one of the most 
spirited and fascinating works ever written 
about Shakespeare, makes its defects especially 
deplorable. The author seems deliberately to 
have chosen the role of the special pleader 
rather than that of the cautious investigator. It 
is not to be denied that he is an effective writer, 
nor that his rhetoric is often used in the service 
of just views. The book reads like a series of 
" University Extension " lectures by a profes- 
sor more adroit to persuade than scrupulous to 
instruct his audience. One is often tempted 
to push the work aside with the remark that it 
may do very well for the general public, but that 
it is not for the student. This is, however, a 
fallacy, one to which the kindly reviewer too 



350 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



often resorts in his desire to say a good word 
for the work of a clever man. The truth is that 
no book is fit to be recommended to the general 
public which is not at the same time of value 
to the scholar. In other words, it must be true 
as far as it goes. No one can keep in mind all 
the minute facts and nice arguments that come 
within the purview of a comprehensive book 
about Shakespeare. The author of such a book 
must therefore be as scrupulous about " the 
mint and the cummin " as about " the weightier 
matters of the law." Attention to detail is the 
touchstone of reverence for truth ; and every 
student knows how often the weightier matters 
hang upon trifles. 

Dr. Brandes's book is not only interesting 
and skilfully written : it contains many just crit- 
icisms and suggestive remarks, and some inter- 
pretations that are brilliant and even illuminat- 
ing. But in order to utilize his book one must 
follow him up patiently step by step, exam- 
ining his sources and testing his conclusions. 
Such a method of reading, however profitable 
it may be to the student, does not heighten 
one's respect for the book. One gradually be- 
comes convinced that the author is not always 
to be trusted for his facts and never for his 
inferences. Of course the general reader can- 
not be expected to follow an author up in any 
such way. He could not if he would ; and Dr. 
Brandes does his work so neatly, and with such 
an air of confident superiority, that no one not 
especially acquainted with the subject would 
dream of distrusting him. His method is one 
which has become only too common. A fasci- 
nating theory is set up ; doubtful traditions or 
unverified statements of fact are put forward ; 
lines from the plays or the poems are pressed 
into service ; and, out of this nebula of uncer- 
tainties, certainty is hocus-pocussed, and 
there stands the author, with the air of being 
master of the situation, pointing triumphantly 
to his conclusion ! The method is irresistible, 
the audience is enthusiastic, and the book has 
an immense vogue. It is thus that many a lit- 
erary reputation is made, many a university 
chair or academic fauteuil attained. Mean- 
while it is becoming harder and harder to se- 
cure the dissemination of reasonable views 
when they chance to be unsensational ; and in 
this fascinating field of literary study false 
prophets arise to prophesy, some in Shake- 
speare's name and some in Bacon's, and in their 
names to write many wonderful works.

THE MATERIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY.* 

Some twelve years ago, Prof. Moses Coit Tyler 
called the attention of the American Historical 
Society to the constant danger and frequent 
destruction of the material for making complete 
the history of the United States, and urged the 
Society to become the agent for the collection 
and proper preservation of such material. But 
it was felt that local historical societies, state 
commissions, etc., were already engaged in this 
useful work, and that it would be wiser to help 
these existing agencies than to create new ones. 
Yet, finding that many States with ample stores 
of material did nothing, and that many socie- 
ties were hampered by a lack of resources, the 
American Society, at its annual meeting in 
1895, appointed an Historical Manuscript 
Commission, consisting of Professor Jameson 
of Brown University, Mr. Talcott Williams of 
the Philadelphia press, Professor Turner of the 
University of Wisconsin, and Professor Trent 
of the University of the South. The first Report 
of this commission is now given to the public. 

The members of the commission early deter- 
mined to omit from their consideration archives 
of all kinds, unless having a national bearing ; 
to avoid trenching on grounds occupied by ex- 
isting agencies ; and to assist societies having 
matter suited for publication but without means 
of doing so. Naturally, the first effort was to 
discover and catalogue the available resources. 
The commission, therefore, sent out two circu- 
lars, the one to individuals, the other to organ- 
izations. The response to the latter has been 
more general than to the former appeal ; yet 
sufficient returns are now in to show a surpris- 
ingly large amount of unpublished matter, not 
alone valuable in itself but tending to throw 
light on isolated letters already in print. To 
secure these papers for publication is, it must 
be presumed, not always an easy task ; hence 
the commission is able to announce only the 
hope of presenting in future reports the " cor- 
respondence of two brothers, prominent states- 
men of that region [the Middle States] during 
the first half of the present century," and " the 
unpublished papers of one of the greatest of 
Southern statesmen." But the profitable show- 
ing made in the first Report needs neither 
apology nor promises. If this be an earnest of 
the future, the commission has earned the grat-

itude not only of the Historical Association, of 
teachers and students of American history, but 
of every citizen who has at heart the preserva- 
tion of the story of our national rise and 
progress. 

Departing from the example of the Royal 
Commission on Historical Manuscripts of En- 
gland (founded in 1869), which prints only 
calendars of collections, the commission began 
the task of selecting the matter which should 
make up its first Report. The Revolutionary 
period had been most largely explored and its 
documents most largely printed ; the Colonial 
period had been almost as fully exploited. It 
was therefore decided to take for the first work 
of the commission the period from the end of 
the Revolutionary War to the beginning of the 
nineteenth century a formative period when 
the infant republic was making its first effort 
to secure recognition as a nation and was learn- 
ing much by the hard rule of necessity. From 
the Foreign Office in London extracts were 
made from the correspondence of Phineas 
Bond, sometime British consul at Philadelphia. 
The letters cover the period from the beginning 
of 1787 to the end of 1789, furnishing a store- 
house of information on the imports, exports, 
manufacture, products, and population of the 
States, as well as on international questions, 
such as the treatment of the Tories, the British 
debts owing in America, and the British soldiers 
retained in the Western forts. The second 
contribution in the Report is from Dr. Douglas 
Brymner, Archivist of the Dominion of Canada. 
It consists of copies of four letters supposed to 
be written by a traitor in Philadelphia to the 
Duke of Mirepoix, offering for a sum of money 
to raise an army in Pennsylvania for marching 
to Fort Pitt and assisting the French in the 
French-Indian war. The intercepted letters 
are accompanied by nineteen others, showing 
the efforts put forth by the English government 
to discover the writer. Much side information 
is thus given out, and one can now more readily 
appreciate the ignorance of the home govern- 
ment concerning the colonies when one sees 
how readily the fabrications of this mysterious 
writer were believed. He asserted that he had 
already enlisted 1800 Germans and Irish, had 
rallied all the able-bodied Acadians (!), and 
would soon have 2000 more soldiers under his 
banner. That a man who had been " solicited 
to be at the head of a considerable army to be 
raised this Winter in Pennsylvania Govt. &c," 
would place Fort Du Quesne 900 miles from 
Canada, and speak of the Pennsylvania " Ger- 



mans imported from Holland," and yet be 
credited, is passing strange ; but very strenuous 
efforts were made to discover him, even the 
name of Washington being considered in a 
process of elimination of suspected persons. 

Returning more closely to the period intended 
to be covered in the Report, the Letters of 
Stephen Higginson, contributed largely by his 
grandson, Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, 
present much new information concerning 
Shay's Rebellion, the rise of the Federalists, 
the Essex Junto, and political life in New En- 
gland. These letters show a wealthy Boston 
merchant and bank director, supposed to be 
worth at one time over 8400,000, taking an 
active part in politics, and offering most prac- 
tical suggestions for the Federal Constitution 
at the time of its formation. The fifty-seven 
letters of Higginson cover the period of 1783 
to 1806. 

The South is represented in the Report by 
the Diary of Edward Hooker, a native of Con- 
necticut, who went to South Carolina from Yale 
college, and recorded his observations on life 
in that State from 1803 to 1808. The editor 
has wisely sacrificed the young man's opinions 
on the social life in South Carolina for the care- 
ful retention of everything bearing on the po- 
litical life of the future great leader of the 
South during this transitional and formative 
period of her existence. 

The apparently inexhaustible resources of 
the Wisconsin Historical Society have been 
drawn upon for that portion of the Report 
which represents the West, supplemented by 
contributions from the library of Col. Reuben 
T. Durrett, of Louisville, Ky., and also from 
the French Archives. The Louisiana expedi- 
tion which Gen. George Rogers Clark proposed 
to make under the patronage of Genet, in 
1793-5, forms the main object of the collection 
of letters and papers ; but about it are clus- 
tered the interesting and sometimes puzzling 
questions of Jefferson's connivance, the atti- 
tude of the other officials, and the relations 
with the Indians, with Spain, and with France. 
These documents close the Report, without an 
index. 

An important feature of the Report is a 
Bibliography, geographically arranged, of the 
printed lists and descriptions of historical man- 
uscripts and archives in Washington and scat- 
tered through the different States. In this cat- 
alogue the student may ascertain at least where 
he can look for unprinted material upon a sub- 
ject he is investigating, and thus it marks a 



352 



THE DIAL 



[June 1, 



distinct step toward that historical cooperation 
and systemization so much needed for intelli- 
gent, complete, and profitable local investiga- 
tion. The list is not necessarily complete, but 
its publication will bring additions. It is com- 
paratively free from errors, although a few have 
crept in, such as (page 509) "Nimian" for 
Ninian Edwards. 

Certainly no one will criticise the decision of 
the commission to print the documents instead 
of calendars of them ; to sacrifice a certain ex- 
actness by using translations of all languages 
save French, and thereby to gain a wider use- 
fulness ; to print entire letters, and, as far as 
possible, entire documents, instead of extracts. 
Some criticism may be heard concerning the 
selection of the material for this first report ; but 
account should be taken of the natural difficul- 
ties under which such efforts are carried on 
difficulties due not to hostility on the part of 
holders of valuable papers, but to procrastina- 
tion in replying to inquiries, to reluctance in 
giving out what is often regarded as personal or 
family history, and to the very limited resources 
of the commission, which made much of the 
labor a labor of love. 

It now remains for teachers, students, and 
readers of American history, as well as all inter- 
ested in this subject, to call public attention to 
the first fruits of the Historical Manuscripts 
Commission ; to arouse general interest in fur- 
thering its ends ; and to secure the cooperation 
of other agencies well equipped to supplement 
its efforts in the praiseworthy task of preserv- 
ing in all its details the interesting story of our 
great experiment in representative government.

THE MEMOIRS OF A LIEUTENANT- 
GENERAL,.* 



If there is a particular feature which gives 
special value to the story told by Lieutenant- 
General Schofield of his forty-six years of ser- 
vice in the United States army, it is that the 
various chapters are composed of materials 
gathered at the time of the events described or 
prepared immediately after the publication of 
some volume of reminiscences which awakened 
recollections in the mind of the writer. And 
although the notes were carefully reexainiued 
and revised before their publication in compact

form, the evidences of contemporaneous treat- 
ment are many. 

As long as there are any unpublished papers 
relating to the Civil War, volumes of " me- 
moirs " must be expected, setting forth the ac- 
complishments of their author in as favorable 
a light as possible. Even if the matter is largely 
personal, historical literature will be enriched 
by such publications. Just why this or that 
battle was lost, and just who was to blame for 
certain mistakes, may not be finally determined 
by this generation of Americans, but the his- 
torian who tries to tell the story of our Civil 
War to those who come after all the actors in 
the great drama are dead will have an exceed- 
ingly difficult task when he seeks the exact 
truth amid the contradictory accounts furnished 
in the memoirs of generals North and South.

field's interesting life-story with the feeling that 
many men have been unduly honored by the 
people. In important movements of the Civil 
War, General Schofield had opportunity to 
know the leaders. At the start he was connected 
with the army in the midst of the difficulties in 
Missouri. He realized the mistake in the battle 
of Wilson's Creek, where the brave Nathaniel 
Lyon sacrificed his life needlessly. He speed- 
ily formed an unfavorable opinion of General 
Fremont, and his account sustains the position 
of those who feel that the enthusiasm of the 
campaign of 1856 gave to the first Republican 
candidate for the presidency a higher place in 
the esteem of the people than his abilities would 
otherwise have secured him. As each year of 
the war is described, the effect of the story is 
distinctly depressing, because of this element 
of personal criticism, which sometimes makes 
a firm impress on the mind of the reader, even 
when the unfavorable comment is accompanied 
by words of praise. The case of General 
Thomas is an example. If the reader should 
happen to have been brought up in a part of 
the country filled with ex-soldiers of that army 
which loved General Thomas with a fervor of 
devotion rarely manifested among men, the ac- 
count of the engagements in which both Gen- 
eral Schofield and General Thomas played 
prominent parts would seem unduly harsh to- 
ward the latter. There is evidence that personal 
feeling is involved in the pages. 

Looking backwards, many famous engage- 
ments seem based upon plans that are faulty 
from the standpoint of a military commander, 
or in the eyes of a student of strategy. The 
battle of Bunker Hill has been severely criti- 



1898.]

cised, as showing frightful blunders on the part 
of British and Americans alike. But such crit- 
icism will never affect the position of that en- 
gagement in American history. It is not always 
well-laid plans and skilful manoeuvring which 
succeed in warfare ; sometimes it is a happy 
conjunction of circumstance, and more than a 
trifle of luck. It was success which gave Sher- 
man's " march to the sea " its glory. Defeat 
and disaster might have shown very clearly the 
lack of military skill involved in such a move- 
ment. The West may have been improperly 
protected at a critical time. Grant may not 
have needed Sherman's help in finishing the 
struggle. But the fact remains that the famous 

oo 

march has found a place in song and story, and 
that it will be a long time before criticism can 
erase from American annals the account of that 
military excursion. 

Perhaps the most important pages in General 
Schofield's volume are those given to a memo- 
randum, written in 1868, regarding interviews 
with General Grant and Attorney- General 
Evarts relative to General Schofield's accept- 
ance of the portfolio of War, in the last part of 
President Johnson's stormy administration. 
As Mr. Evarts was one of the counsel for the 
impeached president, and General Grant was 
outspoken against Mr. Johnson, the varying 
views shown make this particular memorandum 
very interesting reading. How General Scho- 
field conducted himself in the trying situation 
is indicated in Mr. Elaine's words : " He took 
charge of the War Department at a difficult 
and critical time, but his administration of it 
was in all respects successful and received the 
commendation of fair-minded men in all par- 
ties." Set against this achievement as a cabinet 
member in an unpleasant period might be the 
experience as commandant at West Point, the 
acceptance of which position General Schofield 
designates " the mistake of my life." There 
were ups and downs in the life of forty-six 
years in the army, but there were enough ele- 
ments of satisfaction in it to more than make 
up for any periods when the experiences were 
not entirely pleasant. 

Aside from the chapters which deal with 
events which have occasioned controversy, the 
volume contains much that is interesting read- 
ing for itself alone. The recent history of the 
United States Army is well presented, and the 
discussions of the defensive strength of the 
country are full of suggestiveness at this time 
of war's alarms.

A SCIEXTTFIC BlBI/E DICTIONARY.* 



The announcement of Dr. Hastings's great 
Bible Dictionary, made some little time since, 
aroused considerable interest in theological cir- 
cles. The monumental work of Smith had 
passed through two independent revisions, but 
one of them (that by Professors Hackett and 
Ezra Abbott) was hopelessly out of date ; while 
the other, which appeared in England only a 
few years since, covered only one-third of the 
work, and was very expensive. There was room 
for a thoroughly new dictionary written from 
a modern point of view and representing the 
precipitate of criticism. Especially was this 
necessary in the departments of Introduction 
and Biblical Theology, in which " scientific " 
theology has made its influence most felt. 

The first instalment of this present work is 
on the whole satisfactory, although it is marked 
by one very serious defect : its Biblical theology 
is not Biblical theology in any true sense. En- 
glish scholars, especially of the New Testament, 
however much they excel in certain lines of 
investigation, have not shown such aptitude for 
such historical methods in theology as those of 
Germany or America, and in certain instances 
have seemed unwilling to break free from the 
dogmatic position of the Established Church ; 
but it was hoped that all this might be reme- 
died in work entrusted to such competent edit- 
orship as that of Dr. Hastings. But the result 
has not justified the hope. Such articles as 
would naturally be included under Biblical 
Theology are hardly more than restatements of 
ecclesiastical or dogmatic positions supported 
by references to Scripture texts, and in one or 
two instances the writers have apparently sub- 
stituted Church History for Scripture. 

But such faulty method is confined to this 
group of subjects. The articles on questions 
of chronology, history, and Introduction leave 
little to be desired. Here, especially, one meets 
with considerable concession to the critical 
school. Professor Hommel, it is true, writes 
upon Babylonia and Assyria, but his position 
can hardly be classed as that of a traditionalist ; 
while the papers upon the Chronology of the 
Old Testament, and the Book of Daniel, by 
Professor E. L. Curtis, and that upon Deuter- 
onomy by President Ryle, are, as one would 
expect, abreast of the best recent conclusions.

In his paper upon David, Professor H. A. 
White would reduce the number of Davidic 
psalms as given even by Ewald. But in no case 
are the articles radical in conclusion or even 
suggestion. 

The same progressive yet conservative spirit 
is to be seen in the articles dealing with similar 
matters in the New Testament, although the 
article upon Acts hardly gives as much atten- 
tion as one could wish to the various critical 
questions the book involves. The brilliant ar- 
ticle upon the Chronology of the New Testa- 
ment is not only one of great learning and orig- 
inality but also one that shows the effect of 
recent studies. Geographical and archaeological 
subjects are similarly well handled. 

Altogether, the volume marks a distinct stage 
in theological development, in that it is soberly 
and constructively critical. One would not ex- 
pect or wish that it should represent radical 
positions, but it will be a revelation to those 
people who have decried or scorned critical 
results to see how far English and American 
scholars of recognized sobriety and learning 
have accepted them. In this particular the 
work is destined to have a lasting influence for 
the good, for it cannot fail to become authori- 
tative among those persons whose own teach- 
ings will set the trend of popular theology dur- 
ing the next generation. And it further proves 
that to-day's theologians are not dogmatists, 
but are working with the acumen and method 
of genuine science. SHAILER MATHEWS.

distinctive delineation, and when its fundamental 
theme is based upon a condition of spiritual stress 
known by personal experience to every earnest man 
or woman of this generation, it may justly claim a 
more careful consideration than is deserved by the 
rank and file among the productions of current fic- 
tion. Such a book must be treated as literature 
rather than as entertainment, and such a book we 
undoubtedly have in Mr. Robert Herrick's " The 
Gospel of Freedom." Mr. Herrick's previously 
published stories have shown him to be a conscien- 
tious worker in his art, with well-conceived ideals of 
both its form and its ethical content. But their scale 
has been so small as to preclude the putting forth of 
the most serious kind of effort, and they have dis- 
played, at the most, a talent for doing the sort of 
thing that Mr. Henry James does so supremely 
well, and that remains, after all, so supremely futile. 
In " The Gospel of Freedom " Mr. Herrick has 
taken heart for a flight of wider sweep than hereto- 
fore, yet has been careful not to exceed the limits 
of his conscious power. His art is still capable of 
much further development in several directions ; it 
has not acquired the strength to which it may some 
time attain, and the severe lesson of restraint has 
not been wholly learned. It is still too closely the 
transcript of an unassimilated personal experience. 
But it has the promise of swift and vigorous growth, 
and already represents an achievement which is 
considerable for so young a writer. The gospel of 
freedom is a phrase of many meanings, but they 
are all reducible to two categories. That the truth 
makes men free is one of the oldest of sayings, but 
from what is it that men are to be freed? From 
the tyranny of circumstance and environment, say 
some ; from the bondage of irrational instincts and 
passions, say others. To put it differently, there is 
an external freedom and an internal freedom, and 
each has had its impassioned champions in all ages. 
That the latter is the truer and higher form of free- 
dom is hardly to be doubted by those who have felt 
the emancipating influence of Goethe, and the innere 
Freiheit which he has helped so many to win is the 
most precious of all possessions. Again and again 
do we find this lesson enforced by the finer spirits 
of the century now ending Schopenhauer, Arnold, 
Renan, and Ibsen, and in comparison with this 
ideal the old outpourings against kingcraft and 
priestcraft, against institutions and observances, 
seem the "trumpery" that Dr. Ibsen contemptuously 
styles them, seem at the best but means to an end 
whose existence they barely realize. Now, the per- 
son whose quest of freedom forms the substance of 
Mr. Herrick's book, although herself a woman little 
above the commonplace, although not invested with 
qualities of extraordinary charm, although merely 
typical of a class numbered by tens of thousands in 
every advanced country, does yet in her experience 
so embody the lesson of the two kinds of freedom 
that she becomes a significant figure. To this fine 
issue is her spirit so touched that she realizes in the 
end, after having loosened herself from the external

trammels under which she chafed, that she is not 
really free, that her struggle for freedom has only 
just begun, that the vital problem is still unsolved, 
and stares her in the face more threateningly than 
did ever the problems that she had hitherto fancied 
were the only serious ones. Such is the main import 
of Mr. Herrick's novel. There remains to say that 
the scenes are set in Paris, Florence, and Chicago, 
that the story has both action and actuality, that 
the characters are well grouped, and their inter- 
course animated, that the residual impression is of 
a clean-cut piece of workmanship. One cannot help 
recalling, at times Mr. Warner's " Little Journey in 
the World " and its sequel, at times Dr. Ibsen's " A 
Doll Home." The heroine is placed in a situation 
closely resembling that of Mr. Warner's heroine, 
and she escapes from it much after Nora's fashion. 
That part of the book which is descriptive of life in 
Mr. Herrick's adopted city will hardly be relished 
by its inhabitants. Such bits of personality as " the 
scamp that owns the mayor and the city council," 
and the " kind of buffoon " who represents the State 
of Illinois at a public celebration are not numerous, 
and few will take exception to them, but certain 
things that are said about Chicago in general are too 
painfully truthful for their writer to hope for for- 
giveness, while there is a merciless realism about his 
report of the conversation at social gatherings that 
will make some of his readers grieve, and would 
make more of them grieve were the satirical intent 
not so deftly concealed from the duller-witted. 
Finally, although a very small matter, we will re- 
mark that Mr. Herrick should look more carefully 
to his spelling of foreign words. We know of no 
San Geminiano in Italy or elsewhere, seduisante 
badly needs an accent, enthusiasmes is neither 
French nor English, and sympatico does not exist 
in any known language. 

There is a crispness of manner and a breeziness 
of invention about " The Celebrity " that go far 
toward making it one of the most entertaining books 
of the season. The hero is a popular American 
story-writer, adored by young women, and celebrated 
for both his books and his conquests. Weary of 
what he is pleased to call his fame, he repairs to a 
Western summer resort, and assumes the name of 
another man to whom he bears a close personal re- 
semblance. Here he becomes a lion of the verandas 
and a leader of cotillons, incidentally occupying 
himself in the pleasant task of making love to two 
girls. Unfortunately for him, the girls in question 
are not of the usual " summer " type, but young 
women of insight and blessed with a keen sense of 
humor. They play with him in the most delightful 
way, protected from discovery by the invulnerable 
armor of his conceit, while fate joins hands with 
them in the most unexpected way by turning the 
real owner of the name he has assumed into an em- 
bezzler and fugitive from justice. How his new 
friends accept the situation, pretend not to believe 
his explanations, and hustle him away in a yacht 
and over the Canadian border, are things to be read 



about in Mr. Churchill's genial pages, not to be 
feebly described in a summary like this. One bit 
may be quoted. The Celebrity is brought face to 
face with the two heroines, to the second of whom 
he has just offered his hand and heart. She an- 
nounces the fact to her friend, who calmly remarks : 
" But, Marian, you can 't have him. He is engaged 
to me. And if it 's quite the same to yon, I want him 
myself. It is n't often, you know, that one has the 
opportunity to marry a Celebrity." After two pages 
of delicious comedy, which the girls had carefully 
planned in anticipation of such a scene as this, the 
denouement is reached. 

" ' Marian,' said Miss Trevor, ' I am going to be very gen- 
erous. I relinquish the prize to you, and to yon only. And 
I flatter myself there are not many girls in the world who 
would do it.' 

' 'Thank you, Irene,' Miss Thorn replied gravely, 'much 
as I want him, I could not think of depriving you.' 

" Well, there is a limit to all endurance, and the Celebrity 
had reached his. 

" ' Crocker,' he said, ' how far is it to the Canadian Pacific ? ' 

" I told him. 

' ' I think I had best be starting,' said he. 

" And a moment later he had disappeared into the woods." 

This amusing story will give zest to the holiday 
hours of many readers during the present summer, 
and their enjoyment will no doubt be heightened by 
the fact that no one can miss discovering in the 
Celebrity of the novel a celebrity of actual life. 

There is a fine democracy in the novels of Mr. 
Hopkinson Smith that goes far to cover up their 
structural defects. We feel that their author is a 
man of the wide world, not the narrow one, that 
his sympathies are not circumscribed by the limits 
of any caste or social stratum, that he delights in 
natural manliness, whatever the station in which it 
may be found. The intercourse with many sorts 
and conditions of men that has resulted from his 
varied experiences as artist, traveller, and engineer 
has both widened and quickened his sympathies, and 
enabled him to delineate for us with equal insight 
Venetian gondoliers, Virginia colonels, and men who 
do with their hands the rough necessary work of the 
world. It is the latter type that he presents to us 
in the person of Caleb West, who is the hero of his 
latest novel, unless indeed the real hero be no human 
being whatever, but the lighthouse that gets itself 
built despite the fury of the adverse elements that 
would balk civilization of its conquest. The scenes 
depicted are not unlike those in Mr. Kipling's " Cap- 
tains Courageous," and have something of his sin- 
cerity and strength. The interest, however, is far 
more varied, and episodes from a politer sphere of 
existence share the attention. There is a Southern 
" major " who delights us after the fashion of Col- 
onel Carter, and there are two love-stories one 
expressed and one only suggested besides the trag- 
edy that so nearly wrecks Caleb's life. In the strug- 
gle of his contracting engineer with an ignorant 
government inspector of the work, Mr. Smith has 
doubtless embodied some of his own experience with 
the sort of malicious stupidity that our political sys- 
tem too often clothes with brief official authority,

and we take great satisfaction in the final discom- 
fiture of this particular scoundrel. But credulity is 
at least strained when, after having taken elaborate 
measures to secure evidence of the incompetence of 
his enemy, our engineer is made, in the closing 
chapters, to forget that any such evidence exists, 
and to be surprised when it is forthcoming. This 
is the chief of the several technical faults with which 
the story, in spite of its genial vitality, is clearly 
chargeable. 

The author of " Hassan : a Fellah " has lived for 
many years in Palestine, and accumulated a great 
store of information concerning the history of the 
country, as well as concerning the customs and be- 
liefs of its Mohammedan inhabitants. This infor- 
mation he has unloaded in somewhat indiscriminat- 
ing and wholesale fashion upon the work of fiction 
which bears the above title, and which proves rather 
exasperating to read by reason of its effort to be so 
very instructive. Stripped of its scientific and his- 
torical accessories, it appears as a touching story of 
native love, thwarted in various ways such as the 
sending of the hero to Crete with the army, but 
brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It is a con- 
scientious piece of work, and that is about all. 

" A Queen of Hearts," by Miss Elizabeth Phipps 
Train, is an example of the sort of story that affords 
an hour of mild entertainment, and is completely 
forgotten the next week or month. It is the auto- 
biography of an actress, nurtured in a Puritan house- 
hold, but unable to repress the impulse to lead a 
freer life, an impulse that has come to her legitimately 
enough from a French play-acting father. She be- 
comes a queen of the lyric stage, enjoys a checkered 
but successful career, and deserves, on the whole, 
the happiness that is eventually her share. The 
tone of the book is prettily sentimental, and the 
incidents of a rather stereotyped sort. It has a cer- 
tain amount of grace and animation, although the 
flush of its life has a slightly hectic suggestion. 

" Madame of the Ivies," another story by the 
same writer, reproduces these qualities with an 
altered scenario. It again takes the form of auto- 
biography, being told by the young woman who is 
its heroine, and who becomes the companion of an 
old woman who lives in absolute seclusion, as the 
result, partly of blindness, partly of the tragic hap- 
penings that seem to have wrecked her life. The 
novel might almost be described as a pale reflection 
of "Jane Eyre," for it has several of the character- 
istics of that immortal work the governess, the 
sombre hero, and his maniac wife, immured for 
years in the family mansion. The story is brought 
to a happy ending, and sunlight at last flows into the 
lives of both the stricken mother and the injured son. 

The story of " The War of the Worlds " is con- 
trived with an ingenuity of invention that outdoes 
M. Jules Verne, yet it remains almost as unconvinc- 
ing as the pseudo-scientific imaginings of that enter- 
taining Frenchman. It is difficult to take seriously 
these Martians who look like leather polyps, who go 
stalking about England in spheroidal long-legged 



metallic engines, and who deal death and destruc- 
tion by means of heat-rays and poisonous suffocat- 
ing vapors. The best parts of the story are those 
that describe the advent of the Martians in cylinders 
shot from our neighbor planet, and those others that 
make the terrible visitors succumb to the ravages 
of the terrestrial microbe. In this book, as in such 
others as " The Time Machine " and " The Invis- 
ible Man," Mr. Wells accepts to the full the logical 
implications of his primary postulate, and works in. 
a good deal of effective realism in the detailed de- 
scription of occurrences. The imagination displayed 
is somewhat unusual in intensity, although of a cheap 
sort, and if his account of " The War of the Worlds " 
does not actually thrill, it may at least be admitted 
to entertain. 

Dr. Conan Doyle, in " A Desert Drama," has 
found an excellent subject for dramatic narrative, 
and has told a story of sustained and exciting inter- 
est. A party of English-speaking tourists on the 
Nile who have ventured beyond the First Cataract 
leave their boat one morning to explore a famous 
temple. They are attacked by a band of dervishes 
and taken into captivity. Some of the party are 
murdered and the others are started by their cap- 
tors for Khartoum. At a critical juncture they are 
rescued by a detachment of the Egyptian Camel 
Corps and restored to civilization. The characters 
are clearly outlined, and both talk and act in a sim- 
ple and natural manner. When one thinks of the 
temptation for melodramatic handling offered by 
such a situation, one can hardly praise the writer 
sufficiently for his restraint. Perhaps the most dis- 
tinct impression left by this strong story is of the 
sharp contrast between the careless ease and frivo- 
lous preoccupations of the tourist party and the grim 
realities with which they are so startlingly con- 
fronted. There is no nonsense about the dervishes, 
but it takes some time for their captives to realize 
the fact and adjust their mental focus to the new 
conditions. It is not often that people are con- 
fronted with the seriousness of life by so sharp a 
turn as this, and the difficult situation thus created 
is handled by Dr. Doyle with an insight into the 
springs of character no less admirable than that 
which goes to the depiction of its external aspects. 
Just at this time, when the recapture of Khartoum 
by the forces of civilization is a certainty of the near 
future, " A Desert Drama " is a timely book, and 
will have a host of readers. 

" The Pride of Jennico " is a quasi-historical novel 
of a somewhat familiar type, being concerned with 
the fortunes of an English gentleman of the eight- 
eenth century, who falls heir to a vast estate in 
Southeastern Europe, and the story of his love for 
a German princess. It is a tale of long-drawn 
agonies, desperate adventures, and final success. 
What separates it from most books of its class is its 
distinction of manner, its unusual grace of diction, 
its delicacy of touch, and the fervent charm of its 
love-passages. It is a very attractive piece of ro- 
mantic fiction, scorning most of the cheap devices

employed by books of its general class, and relying 
for its effect upon character rather than incident, 
and upon vivid dramatic presentation rather than 
mechanical stage- craft. 

Mr. Christie Murray is a story-teller of a some- 
what old-fashioned type, but for that not the less to 
be commended. His characters are apt to be chil- 
dren of the soil rather than of the salon ; human 
beings with genuine emotions instead of the varied 
sorts of degenerates with which much of our fiction 
is concerned. In the very title of his latest book, 
" This Little World," there is an old-fashioned ring, 
and the story turns out to be the kind of thing that 
we have read many times before, and are always 
glad to read again. - In a word, it is the old story 
of genius, unfavored by circumstance, but working 
out a successful career from sheer strength of inner 
impulse. How John Cutler dabbles in paints with 
dogged determination, how a happy accident starts 
him on the track of technical acquirement, how he 
toils and starves until he forces the world to recog- 
nize his power, how love makes him suffer for a 
time and rewards him in the end these are the 
things of which we may read in Mr. Murray's warm- 
hearted and wholesome tale these and many minor 
matters of interest, betraying throughout the obser- 
vant eye, the responsive sympathy, and enough of 
the art rhetorical to make the presentation accept-

Major Arthur Griffiths's Welling- 
f *?"> Hi8 Comrades and Contempora- 

ries " (Longmans) is a handsome 
memorial volume, about three-fourths of which is 
devoted to the Duke, the balance of it containing 
brief sketches of his leading lieutenants, Cotton, 
Hill, Beresford, Picton, Craufurd, Moore, and the 
rest. Wellington's reputation has suffered from a 
certain reaction in public sentiment of late, and 
there has even been a tendency on the part of his 
countrymen to harp on his familiar foibles and to 
belittle his really superior gifts and services as a 
soldier. No censor has gone quite as far as 
O'Connell did when he flouted the Iron Duke as a 
" Stunted Corporal "; but the less admirable traits 
in his character have been somewhat unduly em- 
phasized and dwelt on. We have been told that he 
was harsh, unsympathetic, ungrateful ; without 
strong affection, whether as son or father ; taking 
all to his own credit, and passing on little praise and 
fame to those who helped him to his great successes. 
The Wellington of Talavera, Vittoria, and Waterloo, 
has become merged somewhat in the popular appre- 
hension in the Wellington of Apsley House. All 
this is mainly due, perhaps, to that inevitable reac- 
tion of opinion and feeling which is the Nemesis of 
too towering reputations. But the Duke lived to 
see his own popularity decline. His strenuous oppo- 



sition to the Reform Bill gained him widespread 
obloquy ; and the fickle mob, which had cheered 
and deified him after Waterloo, hooted and hunted 
him through the streets and smashed the windows 
of the palace he had acquired in the heyday of his 
glory. Nor was the Duke's bearing under the fire 
of popular insult of the kind that conciliates and 
turneth away wrath. He could repay abuse with 
cutting scorn sometimes with stinging rejoinder. 
Once, on a well-known occasion, when an angry 
crowd ordered him to halt in a narrow street and 
repeat the current popular shibboleth, " God bless 
Queen Caroline," he acquiesced in the demand, but 
added grimly as a Parthian shot while riding away, 
" and may all your wives be like her ! " He har- 
bored a strain of inbred contempt for the minds and 
persons of those composing the theoretically most 
sovereign stratum of the sovereign people - the 
" masses." Wellington was born a " gentleman " 
(in the technical sense) and bred a soldier. He had 
a plain, if a strong, understanding. He was no 
adept at political metaphysics. He did not under- 
stand the modern apotheosis of ignorance and rags. 
He held to the old-fashioned doctrine of the supe- 
rior political fitness of property and education. The 
mob was to him simply the mob, and there was 
nothing sacrosanct about it. It was as good as, and 
no better than, the individuals that composed it ; 
and what those individuals were, he trusted to his 
senses to tell him. The " people " meant for him, 
not a sublime and mystic abstraction, clothed with 
ineffable dignities and fixed inalienable rights, but 
a motley multitude of widely diverse individuals, 
good, bad, and indifferent, largely untaught, un- 
ruly, and unwashed, who were to be governed, not 
according to some fixed fundamental scheme of 
eternal principles drawn from philosophy, but ac- 
cording to their manifest desert and the practical 
exigencies of the moment. Laissez faire was a 
good rule perhaps for fair weather ; but what the 
Duke's notion of the province of government in 
times of intestine storm and stress was may be 
gathered from the nature of his measures for the 
defense of London against the Chartists in 1848. 
The stern old soldier was prepared to deluge the 
streets of the city with blood, as Cavaignac did in 
the same year at Paris, rather than allow the hordes 
of vandalism and anarchy, that were plainly ready 
to turn the honest purposes of the actual petitioners 
to their own account, to work their infamous will on 
civil society. He did not propose to see the Gordon 
riots repeated in his day. Major Griffiths claims 
for his interesting memorial that it is a new move 
toward rehabilitating Wellington in the esteem of 
his countrymen. He has dwelt chiefly on his hero's 
military career, while not neglecting his political 
services. Wellington's personal character is clearly 
and entertainingly portrayed, and there is a rich 
fund of anecdotes including that famous one relat- 
ing how Lord Uxbridge lost a leg while at the Duke's 
side at Waterloo, and how the sad news was imparted 
and received : " I 've lost my leg, by G d ! " cas-

ually remarked his lordship, during the heat of 
battle. "Have you, by G d?" absently replied 
his chief, without removing his glass from his eye. 
The work is handsomely illustrated, mainly with 
portrait. 

A new series of biographies under the 
title " Builders of Greater Britain " 
(Longmans) includes men whose 
sphere of activity has been, in the main, adminis- 
trative, as well as those who have fought and ex- 
plored by sea and land. The first volume of the 
series, by Mr. Martin A. S. Hume, is devoted to 
Sir Walter Ralegh, and fittingly so, for to Ralegh 
and his brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, belongs the 
honor of first undertaking exploration with the dis- 
tinct purpose of founding colonies, and not merely 
for the sake of treasure. Ralegh's life at court, 
his unceasing activity in every branch of learning, 
and his ability as soldier, statesman, and admiral, 
are discussed clearly and entertainingly. Aside 
from Mr. Hume's discovery of some letters of the 
Spanish ambassador Gondomar, the work has little 
that is new either in subject-matter or treatment. 
Mr. Hume, in these letters, which were discovered 
at Simoncas and in the Palace Library at Madrid, 
finds fresh proof of Gondomar's agency in securing 
Ralegh's execution. Extracts from them and from 
the other Spanish papers utilized show that " it was 
no private revenge, it was no desire to inflict pun- 
ishment for the injury actually done on the last 
Guiana voyage, that led Gondomar to hound Ralegh 
to death, for he was practically condemned before 
he sailed, but to serve as an object lesson to England 
that all South America, at least, belonged to Spain." 
Much is made of this new material, nearly a fourth 
of the book being given up to the last Guiana voy- 
age and the Spanish intrigues relating to it. Upon 
the whole, the author, while devoting much space to 
details of home and court life, has fulfilled the pur- 
pose of the series by emphasizing Ralegh's share in 
the development of England's colonies. The sub- 
ject of the second volume of the series is Sir Thomas 
Maitland, a forgotten organizer, though an import- 
ant contributor to England's colonial greatness. 
The author, Mr. Walter Frewen Lord, speaking of 
his hero's family, credits it with " predatory polit- 
ical " instincts, and makes this family characteristic 
a partial explanation or excuse for his earlier po- 
litical inconsistencies. Maitland, indeed, during 
the first years of his parliamentary experiences, 
made bitter speeches against colonial expansion and 
the increase of the navy. This attitude, it would 
seem, was assumed that his silence might be bought 
by the government. His political position, how- 
ever, become totally changed in 1802. During the 
debates on the Treaty of Amiens, and soon after- 
ward, he began those administrative labors which 
constituted his real life-work. His success as Gov- 
ernor of Ceylon led to his appointment as Governor 
of Malta, carrying with it a general direction of 
English interests in the Mediterranean. Here his 



rough and sometimes brutal methods succeeded in 
giving to England more complete control in the 
Mediterranean than she had ever exercised, a con- 
trol which, since that time, has never been recovered. 
Maitland possessed great diplomatic ability as well 
as strong common sense, and the arbitrariness which 
gained for him the name of " King Tom " was often 
assumed, or used as a last resort. Mr. Lord, in 
spite of some vulgarisms, has written a book of great 
interest ; a book which will give to the American 
reader a clearer understanding of certain staunch 
British characteristics, and a more intelligent appre- 
ciation of the men who have helped to make En- 
gland's naval supremacy and her magnificent 
empire. The style is everywhere forcible and the 
characterization excellent. Unfortunately, careless 
proofreading has resulted in numerous typograph- 
ical errors in both of these books. 



The influence of Man is a suggestible animal, says Dr. 
Suggestion in Boris Sidis, in his recent volume on 

mental process. The p 8yc h o logy of Suggestion" 

(Appleton) ; and this means that he is largely influ- 
enced, in his opinions, his feelings, and his actions, 
by other forces than those which make up his own 
inward individuality. Consciously and unconsciously, 
he receives suggestions from his fellow-men, from 
his environment, from the constituted order of 
things which is part of his heredity. The psychol- 
ogy of the mode of action of these varied processes 
of suggestion is full of interest, and Dr. Sidis has 
made a valuable contribution alike to our general 
knowledge of suggestible conditions and to the 
proper explanation and statement of the relations 
of these states to our mental life. While the main 
interest centres in the increased and somewhat ab- 
normal suggestibility which characterizes the hyp- 
notic condition, and this volume is therefore mainly 
concerned with hypnotism, it is well to emphasize 
the existence of normal suggestibility. This is well 
done by Dr. Sidis, by special experiments made 
upon normal persons, and again by considerations 
of social suggestion of the forces that sway the 
crowd in a mob. The street fakir or the shrewd 
political speaker may present the normal side of 
crowd suggestibility ; the contagious panic of fear, 
the religious epidemics, commercial crises, or intel- 
lectual fads, represent various types of unusual or 
abnormal " crowd " action, in all of which sugges- 
tion is an important factor. It is of great practical 
importance that these influences should be fully 
understood. The bulk of the volume is concerned 
with descriptions and explanations mainly the 
latter of the various hypnotic conditions, with the 
hope of shedding light upon the true psychological 
differences which separate the hypnotic from the 
normal waking consciousness. The solution is found 
in the theory of a dissociation or disaggregation of 
groups of mental elements, so that a part of our 
subconscious self is split off from the rest and acts 
in apparent separation from our normal personality. 
This subconscious self comes to the surface in all

forms of hypnotic conditions, and produces many 
startling results. The theory is not without its 
merits, but Dr. Sidis carries it rather too far. There 
is a point beyond which figures of speech do not 
aid explanations, and theoretical assumptions inter- 
fere with rather than promote helpful experimenta- 
tion. Dual personality as an unusual mental phe- 
nomenon is interesting and worthy of record ; it 
cannot as yet be wisely used as a source of explana- 
tion of more common conditions. This portion of 
the volume will be too technical for the general 
reader, and is most likely to be questioned by the 
professional reader. The remainder of the book 
may be highly commended as an able and interest- 
ing contribution to the nature of suggestion and its 
practical importance. 



A book for 



- Statham's "Modern 
Architecture : A Book for Architects 
and the public. and the Public (Scribner) admir- 

ably expresses its meaning. Its appeal is both 
technical and popular. To make such a dual appeal 
requires not only a most thorough knowledge of both 
aspects of the subject, but a style capable of con- 
veying to the minds of the people technicalities in 
such a way that they can be at least partly under- 
stood, and to the minds of architects popular views 
in such wise that they will not seem contemptible 
and offensive because of simplicity, but useful be- 
cause of suggestion. Such a style, difficult as it is, 
Mr. Statham has very happily achieved. His book 
is a most valuable contribution to the literature of 
architecture, and stands perhaps on a different 
plane from any of the rest. M. Viollet le Due's 
" The Habitations of Man in All Ages " is some- 
what on a similar plan, but is far more technical ; 
and it lacks the great charm of dealing directly, as 
does Mr. Statham's book, with the very buildings 
that we see about us, and with some that are not 
yet completed. Churches and town halls, dwelling- 
places and the buildings of trade and commerce, even 
bridges, upon all of these does Mr. Statham touch 
rapidly, incisively, with the sureness of the accom- 
plished artist and the wide knowledge of the man 
of the world. It is fascinating to see how he takes 
churches and houses and business buildings of our 
own time, many of which are familiar to us, and 
applies to them principles of criticism which are 
derived from the study of architecture in all ages, 
yet are never pedantic, never dogmatic, but always 
suggestive, instructive, and certainly helpful to one 
who would build almost any kind of a building 
to-day. His chapter on the use of iron in modern 
construction differs so strikingly from Mr. Ruskin's 
views on that subject, that any reader of this book 
will find the comparison interesting. The great 
English art critic writes almost entirely from the 
standpoint of the idealist. With utilitarianism he 
has but little to do, and that little against his will. 
In this book there is much stress laid upon the beau- 
tiful, but fully as much on the practical. It would 
be hard to say which is the most interesting part of 



the book, but perhaps that which deals with modern 
church architecture shows Mr. Statham's peculiar 
powers better than any other. He is broad-minded 
enough to recognize fully the force of a sentiment 
which has come to associate Gothic with churches, 
yet he shows conclusively that the Mediaeval Gothic 
form is not in all ways suited to the requirements 
of a building for public worship in modern times. 
In this, as in other chapters, many and varied illus- 
trations of different methods of treatment are given. 
These illustrations are beautifully executed, and are 
in themselves enough to make the book most val- 
uable. 



A handbook 
for miner* 

and projector*. 



Mr - Charles A. Bramble's "ABC 
of Mining " (Rand, McNally & Co.) 

ig a p^k^ vo l Qme of 183 pages, 

offered as a handbook for prospectors for minerals. 
It appears to have been prepared with especial refer- 
ence to the Klondike, containing detailed instruc- 
tions as to outfit of tools, clothing, and provisions 
needed in that inhospitable region, with particular 
advice as to how one shall march, camp, eat, sleep, 
prospect, locate and develop a claim, and sell it to 
a pecunious and unsophisticated syndicate. Both 
the merits and defects of the book indicate the work 
of the so-called practical man, at home in the field 
rather than at the desk. Suggestions of great vari- 
ety are presented, drawn evidently from the glean- 
ings of long experience, and of real service to the 
novice who searches the wilderness either for land 
or logs or lodes. The methods of testing ores are 
well detailed, and the difficulties which beset the 
analyst who works with extemporized means in a 
rude shack by the Arctic circle are plainly stated 
and skilfully met. On the other hand, the terms 
and symbols of exact science are often used without 
sufficient explanation, sometimes without any. The 
tyro who needs the proportion on page 43 must 
guess that AT means assay ton : for he is not so told. 
The percentages given on page 95 are not obtain- 
able from the chemical formulae alongside, and the 
names of two of the substances are of doubtful 
spelling. The author's ton is usually 2000 pounds, 
but in the table on page 75 it is 2240 pounds. In 
the same table the gallon equals 277.46 cubic inches ; 
on page 178 it equals 231 cubic inches. A careful 
reviser should have observed such errors, and might 
also have thought it unnecessary to record the dif- 
ference in color of venous and arterial blood. 



More light is shed on Napoleonic top- 

ics bv the 8eries of " New Letters of 
Napoleon I." (Appleton), comprising 
the more important of those omitted from the famil- 
iar collection issued under the auspices of Napoleon 
III. The present volume is a full one, though some 
of the specimens included are mere notelets, and 
the translating and editing have been carefully done 
by Lady Mary Loyd. The dates range from Jan-

uous frequency ; and from this series of curt, per- 
emptory missives to the puissant Minister of Police 
one can form a good notion of the status of individ- 
uals under the Napoleonic regime. There are many 
amusing and characteristic personal references. 
For example, the Emperor writes to Fouche', from 
Pulstuck : " If M. Chdnier ventures on the smallest 
sign, let him know I will send him to the Isles of 
Ste. Marguerite. The time for joking is quite gone 
by. Let him keep quiet. That is the only right he 
possesses. Do not allow that jade, Madame de 
Stael, to come near Paris. I know she is not far 
off." Some months later, Madame comes in for a 
still fiercer reference, and for an epithet quite un- 
mentionable to ears polite : " I am resolved she shall 
never leave Geneva. Let her consort, if she chooses, 
with the friends of Prince Louis ! Paying court 
one day to the great a patriot, a democrat, the 
next ! One's indignation boils over at sight of all 
the shapes assumed by this , a fright into the bar- 
gain ! " Quite refreshing, especially just at present, 
is the following token of the imperial attitude 
toward mischievous journalism : " The Journal de 
V Empire still goes on badly. What business has it 
to insert Mr. Canning's speech in the Copenhagen 
intelligence? Had the editor that speech before 
him ? Ought he to have inserted it without know- 
ing that it suited me ? That young man is either an 
ill-disposed person or a fool ; tell him so from me. 
If he does not change his ways, I shall change the 
editor." Being annoyed by disturbances at Val- 
ladolid, the great man promptly directs that thirty 
of the worst characters in town be arrested and 
shot ; and he shuts off a doctrinal dispute with the 
Bishops by announcing, " I am as much of a theo- 
logian as they are, and even more." There is a 
fair amount of minor information to be got from the 
volume, and it should not be overlooked by close 
students of Napoleonic times.

with his friends among French men of letters which 
M. E. Halperine-Kaminsky has edited and Ethel M. 
Arnold has translated under the title, " Tourgue*-

number of the letters are addressed to Flaubert, 
George Sand, Daudet, Durand-GreVille, and Zola, 
and turn for the most part on appointments for 
meetings, visits, business relations or health, Tour- 
gudnieffs gout being perhaps the most frequently 
recurring topic. There is now and then an opinion 
or point of view that is of greater interest to the 
student of literature, but one cannot help feeling 
that Tourgue'nieff kept his ideas for his books and 
for private conversation. He was not a letter- 
writer, but a man who from force of circumstances 
was obliged frequently to use the mails to commu- 
nicate with his friends. The writer whom we see 
in these pages is a modest, kindly, helpful man,

sincerely attached to his friends, and entirely ab- 
sorbed in the great concern of literature, which 
seems to consist almost exclusively of novels. On 
the whole, the letters bear more convincing testi- 
mony to the kindness of the writer's heart than to 
the keenness of his head, and support the editor's 
contention that Tourgue'nieff was wholly innocent of 
those unkind comments on his French friends which 
were attributed to him and by which Daudet was so 
bitterly offended 

The two handsome volumes entitled 
" Social Hours with Celebrities " 
(Macmillan), though numbered and 
indexed as an independent work, really form, as the 
title-page indicates, the third and fourth volumes of 
the late Mrs. W. Pitt Byrne's lively and entertain- 
ing " Gossip of the Century." The editor is Miss 
R. H. Rusk, and she has shown due diligence and 
judgment in reducing to comparative order the won- 
derful medley of anecdote and chit-chat which her 
sister, Mrs. Byrne, had stored up as material for a 
projected continuation of her popular book. We shall 
not attempt to furnish even a specimen list of Mrs. 
Byrne's gallery of celebrities, English and foreign 
(she runs the social gamut from kings and prelates 
to Cartouche), still less to illustrate the anecdotal 
quality of her book by quotations. Many of her 
stories were matter of her own personal recollection, 
and most of those that were not so bear retelling. 
Now and then an old acquaintance crops up for 
instance, the venerable story of Rothschild's bidding 
Morny " take two chairs "; but the average is fairly 
fresh. The publishers have been liberal in point of 
illustrations, which are mainly portraits. 



BRIEFER MEN TION. 

" Chambers's Biographical Dictionary " (Lippincott), 
edited by Messrs. David Patrick and Francis Hindes 
Groome, who also edited " Chambers's Encyclopaedia," 
is a volume of one thousand pages, and averages ten 
biographies to a page. The editors are no snobs, for 
they include in their work " assassins like Abd-ul-Hamid 
and Ravachol, knaves like Arthur Orton and Jabes Bal- 
four, madmen like Herostratus and Nietzsche, traitors 
like Pickle the Spy and Benedict Arnold, tagrag and 
bobtail." There are many good features to commend 
this most compact and serviceable volume, and the 
jaunty editorial preface of two pages gives one a pleas- 
ant impression of what is to follow. 

" Who 's Who " is an English reference manual that 
has seen the light annually for half a century. Two 
years ago it fell into the hands of Mr. Douglas Sladen, 
who introduced sundry new features, and made it a more 
acceptable adjunct than ever to the editorial desk. The 
1898 volume, now before us, is the fiftieth publication, 
and the second of Mr. Sladen's editing. The seven 
thousand brief biographies have been supplied, or at 
least corrected, by their respective subjects. Since they 
eschew generalities, they may probably be relied upon. 
A sprinkling of American names may be found among 
the biographies.

LITERARY NOTES. 

The Macmillan Co. have published a new edition of 
" Stories from English History," by Rev. A. J. Church. 

The Hon. William L. Wilson, President of Wash- 
ington and Lee University, will be the July convocation 
orator at the University of Chicago. 

Messrs. Adam and Charles Black expect to begin the 
tenth edition of their " Encyclopaedia Britannica " in the 
year 1901, the first of the twentieth century. 

Under the title of The Red, White, and Blue," Mr. 
M. F. Mansfield issues a pretty decorated booklet with 
accurate texts of our four most familiar national songs. 

" The Flying Islands of the Night," a collection of 
poems, is the title of Volume VI. of the edition of Mr. 
J. W. Riley's writings, in course of publication by the 
Messrs. Scribner. 

Two more volumes in the series of " Stories by For- 
eign Authors " have just been published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. The contents are French and 
German, respectively. 

Messrs. Lee & Shepard publish " A History of Our 
Country," by Mr. Edward S. Ellis, being a school text- 
book of the modern sort, excellently arranged and 
attractive in presentation. 

An acceptable addition to the series of " Little Mas- 
terpieces," edited by Mr. Bliss Perry, and published by 
the Doubleday & McClure Co., is a booklet containing 
the most remarkable state papers of Abraham Lincoln, 
including the " lost speech " made at Bloomington, 
May 29, 1856. 

Recent German text-books are the following: " Der 
Praktische Deutsche " (Jenkins), by Mr. U. J. Beiley; 
Lessing's " Minna von Barnhelm " (American Book 
Co.), edited by Mr. M. B. Lambert; and " Die Freiher- 
ren von Gemperlein " with " Krambambuli " (Heath), 
being two stories by Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach, edited 
by Mr. A. R. Hohlfeld. 

The series of "Representative English Comedies" 
which Professor Gayley is editing, and which the Mac- 
millan Co. are to publish, will extend to five octavo 
volumes of about 650 pages each, and about forty plays 
will be included. Each play is to have its own editor 
and apparatus. Heywood's " Interludes " will open the 
series, and " The School for Scandal " will close it. 

An examination for the fellowships in classical archae- 
ology offered by the American School of Classical Stud- 
ies at Athens will be held in March of next year. Two 
fellowships of 8600 each are provided, besides the 
Hoppin fellowship of S1000 for which the candidates 
must be women. Professor B. I. Wheeler, of Cornell 
University will furnish applicants with all needed infor- 
mation. 

The death of Edward Bellamy, on May 22, was not 
unexpected. He had been in declining health for some 
time, and it long ago became evident that a fatal ter- 
mination of his illness might not long be delayed. Born 
near Springfield, Mass., in 1850, he lived to the age of 
forty-eight. He was first a lawyer, then a journalist, 
and finally a man of letters. His early books, "A Nan- 
tucket Idyll," The Blind Man's World," and " Dr. 
Heidenhoff's Process," had no great vogue, although 
discerning critics recognized their marked literary abil- 
ity. But " Looking Backward " (1887) was a different 
matter; it not only had an enormous sale, but it became 
a sort of religion with thousands of people having inclin- 
ations toward socialism. It will long be remembered as 



one of the class of books to which More and Campanella 
contributed, and which describe Utopian commonwealths 
with such vividness of imagination as to create a con- 
siderable sense of reality. Neither this book nor th 
" Equality " of a year ago will bear the tests imposed 
by economic science, and their essential futility has often 
been demonstrated. But they will continue to appeal 
to men of warm sympathies for the oppressed, and the 
ethical glow which they have kindled is perhaps sufficient 
to compensate for the encouragement they have given 
to loose thinking and hopeless social experiments.

With a cover by WILLIAM NICHOLSON, who made Nicholson's Alphabet. 

"Mr, [D. D.] Wells allows his sense of humor to play deftly . . . about the personalities of half a dozen men and women 
whose lives, for a few brief extraordinary days, are inextricably intertwined with the life of the monarch of the jnngle. . . . 
The book smacks of the fun which can be created by clever actors placed in excruciatingly droll situations." N. Y. Tribune.

ALLEN & GREENOUGH'S NEW CAESAR 

Seven Books. Re-edited by J. B. GREENOUGH, Pro- 
fessor of Latin in Harvard University, B. L. D'OOGE, 
Professor of Latin and Greek in Michigan State 
Normal College, Ypsilanti, and M. GRANT DANIELL, 
recently Principal of Chauncy-Hall School, for- 
merly Master in the Roxbury Latin School. Half 
Leather; lx.+616 pages. Fully illustrated. $1.25. 
This new edition of Caesar's " Gallic War " keeps 
prominently in view the needs of the beginner, on the 
ground that a large majority of those who read Caesar 
take it up immediately after finishing their first lessons. 
It is believed that all this class of students' needs have 
been fully met in the present edition. 

Several reading courses are suggested, each one of 
which, while embracing an amount of text equal to the 
first four books, contains choice selections of narrative 
and adventure from the various books. 

The text has been revised, many changes having 
been made, and the whole presents the commentaries 
in an ideal form for rapid and enjoyable reading. The 
illustrations will be found of signal excellence and prac- 
tical value.

By JOHN C. VAN DYKE, L.H.D., 

Art for Art's Sake," Professor of Art at Rutger's College. 
"First Studies in Natural Appearance " is the tub-title of this 
unique volume, in which the author has tried to show in a popular 
way what things in Nature are beautiful and to explain why they 
are so. It is in this sense a detailed nature- guide, which tells how 
to look at the material beauties of Nature : the lights, shadows, 
forms, hues, and atmospheres which go to make up those infinitely 
varied manifestations. Professor Van Dyke has studied the subject 
for many years and in many lands ; he has brought to bear upon it 
the keenness of observation, the authoritative culture, the scientific 
knowledge, and the lucid style, for all of which he is famous ; and 
it is no wonder that such a combination of the nature-lover, the 
landscape painter, and the scientific observer should hare produced 
a volume on Nature illuminating in the extreme and entirely differ- 
ent from anything yet written. Those who already care for the 
beauties of Nature will find clearer vision and more vital apprecia- 
tion through reading it ; while to others it will prove a revelation 
of the every-day wonders which they have hitherto passed by with- 
out notice.

" His name alone carries a laugh with it." 
The Dial. 

" With every new book front Mr. Stockton's 
pen we are reminded of the great Johann Kreut- 
zer's classification of Trilby as a singer : ' Zere 
are two classes of beoble who sing. In ze von 
class, la S pen call ; in ze ozzer all ze c*zer zing- 
era.' So with Mr. Stockton as a ' Romancier.' 
In the one class Mr. Stockton ; in the other all 
the other tellers of stories. 'The Girl at 
Cobhurst ' is delightfully Stocktonian, just as 
unique, as fresh, as original as if Mr. Stockton 
had never done anything else in a similar vein. 
... It is a distinct literary boon, as fresh and 
pure and bright as all that has come from the 
same source." New York Time*.

Mr. E. P. Whipple wrote of it : " Nothing that we 
have read of this wonderful island can compare with 
Mr. Ballou's representation of the beauty of its scen- 
ery, the wonders of its flora and fauna, the fertility 
of its soil, the delight of its perpetual summer."

as does this little volume."

ARMS AND THE BOOK. 

That the laws are silenced by the clash of 
arms is one of the oldest of maxims. In our 
own times, it should not be taken too literally, 
for the fabric of the modern state is so closely 
woven that parts of it may easily be torn with- 
out affecting the integrity of the rest. Nothing 
but the most dire of internecine embroilments 
or the horrors of a widespread invasion could 
now entail a real suspension of the civil law in 
the relations of ordinary life. A nation like 
England may wage half-a-dozen wars at once in 
as many parts of the world without ceasing to 
hold with an even hand the scales of domestic 
justice, and without shock to the machinery of 
administration. We, likewise, engaged as we 
are in naval warfare, need not anticipate among 
its consequences any general slackening of the 
operations of law, or any irruption of the anar- 
chical fires that smoulder beneath every civili- 
zation. Our Enceladus is deeply buried under 
the mountain, and his rumblings offer no just 
cause for alarm. What we have to fear, how- 
ever, and what makes the present situation of 
the nation an object of tragic contemplation, 
is the emergence in our public life of that spirit 
of impulsive recklessness which, while it does 
not actually force civilization to take a back- 
ward step, confronts it with new dangers that 
it is unprepared to meet, and gives effectual 
pause to all the tendencies that hitherto have 
been silently working toward the betterment of 
our social health. Our perspective becomes 
disarranged ; comparatively unimportant things 
become so magnified as to fill all the foreground, 
while matters of the most vital importance to 
our national welfare are crowded out of sight. 
When the war shall have ended, and we shall 
have taken stock of its total outcome, we fear 
that both the narrower interests of our nation 
and the wider interests of humanity in general 
will be found to have lost more than they have 
gained, even in the event of the most complete 
success that it is possible for us to achieve. 

It is not our present purpose, however, to 
discuss these broader aspects of the present 
conflict, but to consider how its turmoil is likely

[June 16, 



subject of education, we are happy to record 
the fact that some of our most honored leaders 
of opinion in this field have dared to risk un- 
popularity for the sake of the truth. To advise 
young men now making their way through col- 
lege to abandon their studies and take the field, 
seems a questionable procedure. Our imme- 
diate need for fighters is less urgent than our 
need, both for the present and the future, of 
educated men to take part in the counsels of 
the nation. Such men can have no more truly 
patriotic aim than that of patiently continuing 
to fit themselves for the battles of the future, 
the battles that must yet be fought to redeem 
our civilization from the insidious foes that 
work within, the bloodless battles which are to 
be won only by the trained intellect and the 
tempered character, and which call for a higher 
form of courage than is needed to face the guns 
of the enemy in literal warfare. As one of our 
correspondents suggests, the recent utterances 
of Professor Charles Eliot Norton constituted 
an act of greater bravery than was displayed by 
Admiral Dewey when he destroyed the Spanish 
fleet at Manila. Magnificent as that feat was, 
it must take a lower place in the scale of cour- 
age than the daring of the man who, in these 
times of popular frenzy, says without regard 
for the consequences what he believes to be true. 
This is not necessarily an expression of entire 
agreement with Professor Norton's views, but 
it is a tribute of respect to the moral force and 
the downright manliness that inspired them. 
After all, the present conditions are very dif- 
ferent from those that obtained during the Civil 
War. Then the question was one of the de- 
fence of the nation from the forces of armed 
rebellion ; now the question is of the perform- 
ance of police duty in a neighboring country. 
The call of duty to the individual citizen was 
then far more imperative than it can possibly 
be in the case of the present war, unless condi- 
tions should arise that are now absolutely un- 
foreseen. With more fighting energy at our 
disposal than is likely to be needed, there is no 
lack of patriotism in suggesting that the work 
of education should be the last of our social 
activities to be impaired by the call to arms. 

It seems proper that a journal devoted to the 
interests of literature should say something 
about the probable or possible effects of the war 
upon the writing and publishing of books. The 
subject has been much belabored already, and 
it is not easy to go far beyond the obvious in 
dealing with it. Looking at it from the eco- 
nomic point of view, it is impossible to deny 



that the effect of war is to discount the resources 
of the future and to make the material condi- 
tions of existence harder for years to come. 
War means much unproductive expenditure, 
and the withdrawal from industrial pursuits of 
many capable men. It means, in the long run, 
increased taxation, lower real wages, and the 
consequent necessity for retrenchment in many 
directions. It means, moreover, an excited and 
unhealthy condition of the public mind, and a 
check upon the operation of the silent forces 
that, in happier times, are ever making for the 
advance of culture and the growth of a more 
righteous civilization. On the other hand, it 
is true that these effects, while inevitable in the 
long run, are sometimes slow to make them- 
selves felt, and that men may for a time be de- 
ceived by that feverish quickening of the indus- 
trial pulse that always accompanies war in its 
earlier stages. For a while, men may fancy 
themselves much more prosperous than they 
are, and the piper may not insist upon pay- 
ment of his bill until it is really long overdue. 
Furthermore, if the war should be brought to 
an early end, its drain upon the resources of 
so wealthy a country as ours would not be very 
serious in its totality, and might be spread over 
so many years that it would not be felt very 
severely at any given time. 

In the matter of book-production, no effect 
is as yet noticeable, and the real test of the mat- 
ter will come next autumn, when we learn to 
what extent the plans of publishers, now being 
made for the coming season, have been inter- 
fered with. The New York " Times " makes 
the significant statement that " in another fort- 
night the early Fall books will begin to be an- 
nounced in abundance, and it is the consen- 
sus of opinion among the publishers that in 
case the war be terminated before September 
the revival of book writing, book printing, and 
book reading will be absolutely unprecedented." 
We trust that this may prove a prophetic say- 
ing, and it is an opinion not without much prob- 
ability. In England, Sir Walter Besant has 
come forward with a cheerful protest against 
the notion that war discourages literature, and 
undoubtedly scores a point when he calls atten- 
tion to the great literary productivity of his own 
country during the trying period of the Napo- 
leonic wars. That the war will give American 
readers an increased interest in the literature 
of warfare is hardly to be doubted, and those 
of our younger writers who are now gathering 
material from the actual observation of battles 
on sea and shore will not be backward in their

effort to satisfy the new demand. Mr. Zang- 
will's humorous suggestion that the present war 
was really instigated by the Century Company 
is not without its grain of truth so far as it hints 
at the probable appetite of our reading public 
during the next few years, and the flood of mem- 
oirs, and campaign-books, and novels 

" Of moving accidents by flood and field, 
Of hairbreadth scapes, i' th' imminent deadly breach," 

will rise to full tide with the end of the nine- 
teenth century. The habit of reading is one 
not easily lost, and we have small faith in the 
pessimistic view that newspaper head-lines in 
poster type, or even the sensational contents of 
the popular periodicals, are going to be ac- 
cepted by future readers as a substitute for 
books. Rather do we believe it true that these 
devices create a new reading public of their own, 
from which the category of book-readers is being 
recruited year by year. Just now, perhaps, 
war-bulletins, and maps of the Spanish posses- 
sions, and the lucubrations of imaginative news- 
paper reporters, may suffice a numerous class 
of readers, but it will not be for long, and the 
bookseller is not likely to find his occupation 
gone next year, although he may have to vary 
his stock in trade in accordance with the changed 
nature of the demand made upon it by the 
public. 



ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

London, June 5, 1898. 

The Whitsuntide holidays are over, and now we are 
busy arranging for the summer holidays. Between now 
and September very little will be done in the matter of 
planning new books. What is to come is already " on 
the stocks," and we shall know in good time what to 
expect. A small few of our publishers take the oppor- 
tunity, at this season, afforded them by little competi- 
tion, to issue some novels for seaside and holiday read- 
ing; but these novels are, as a rule, of but third-rate 
importance, and hardly worth the mentioning. Still, 
there will be one or two due in the coming month which 
may attract more than a passing attention. Certainly 
their writers have achieved a fame which excludes them 
from the " third-rate " category. I mean " The Wheel 
of God," by George Egerton; " The Yellow Terror," by 
M. P. Shiel; "Father Anthony," by Robert Buchanan; 
"The Price of a Wife," by John Strange Winter; and 
The Monks of the Holy Tear," by Lucas Cleave. 

The death of Mr. Gladstone has already brought on 
a plague of biographers; but this is but a foretaste of 
what we may have to endure before the year is out. 
Already one hears of several larger and more important 
works commissioned, as well as reprints of a few which 
have already been published. At present, the daily press 
is amusing and interesting us with the regulation remi- 
niscences and anecdotes. Probably we shall have the 
" authoritative life " from one of the members of the 



family. In that case, Mr. John Murray may reap, as 
Messrs. Macmillan did over the " Life of Tennyson." 

Reprints, and cheap reprints, are the order of the day. 
Our publishers are rivalling each other in the number 
of copyright works they can issue at sixpence. Messrs. 
Chatto & Windus are placing on the market a whole 
shoal by Hall Caine, Clarke Russell, Ouida, Charles 
Reade, and Wilkie Collins. Messrs. Sampson Low have 
followed suit with works by Russell and Blackmore; and 
now Messrs. Macmillan & Co. announce a new series 
headed by Rolf Boldrewood's " Robbery under Arms," 
and including works by Mrs. Oliphant and Mr. F. Marion 
Crawford. Of course, the competition in these " six- 
pennies " will soon become as keen as it is in other mat- 
ters, and the publishers will find that they have worried 
one another to little purpose. After all is said and done, 
only a certain number of books may be published, since 
only a definite number can be sold. And that number 
promises to be reached and satisfied very quickly. 

The New Vagabonds Club will give a dinner in honor 
of the founding of the new magazine " Literature," and 
its guests are to be Mr. and Mrs. H. D. Traill. Mr. 
Anthony Hope is to take the chair, and Mr. Arthur Diosy 
of the Japan Society will act as vice-chairman. There 
are to be speeches galore, and compliments without 
number. Probably this is as it should be. The " New 
Vagabonds " are quick to recognize the " coming man " 
or the " coming event "; but both Mr. Traill and " Lit- 
erature " have already " arrived." Mr. Traill's arrival 
has found him, many years ago, one of the ablest literary 
men of his day. The arrival of " Literature " finds it 
ably dull and dully able. The great point of the dinner, 
let us hope, will be that it may help the directors of 
" Literature " to arrive at a much-needed stage of self- 
consciousness, and thus enable them to review their 
work to see if what has been done was well done; and 
how it may be possible to make it still better. It seems 
to me that there is a criticism still waiting for an ex- 
pression which shall be neither academic nor dilettante, 
but which shall yet embody the finest qualities of each. 
Such criticism, it goes without saying, demands a very 
facile, agile, and accomplished critic, one who is mas- 
ter of the art of measuring instinctively by fixed stand- 
ards, as well as of expressing the results in a polished 
and engaging diction. If there be many who have the 
analytic power, they are found wanting in the syn- 
thetic; and it is found that the few who have the crea- 
tive genius have not often the scholarship necessary for 
making a judgment. But there are many who possess 
both the scholarship and the genius; the " Quarterly 
Review " is witness to this. It is for a journal such as 
" Literature " to afford such men their opportunities; 
and it is for such a man as Mr. Traill to find such men, 
and to nourish them. 

I think I have already told you of the forthcoming 
publication of a story of West Indian life by Mr. 
Haldane McFall. The title of the book is to be " The 
Wooings of Jezebel Pettyfer," and the work embodies 
a vivid picture of the vie intime of the West Indian 
negroes their ideas, superstitions, and peculiar rela- 
tions with the white men. Mr. McFall is a step-son of 
Madame Sarah Grand, and has served some time in a 
Zouave regiment. Portions of the story have already 
appeared in the " Westminster Gazette." 

By the time this reaches you, Dr. Conan Doyle will 
have issued, through Messrs. Smith, Elder, & Co., his 
volume of poems, " Songs in Action," and the same 
publishers will have subscribed Mrs. Humphry Ward's 



374

new novel, " Helbeck of Bannisdale." Dr. Doyle's 
poem of " The White Huntsman," published in " The 
Speaker," deserves a place in his volume; it is one of 
the finest pieces of the kind ever penned. I also ven- 
ture to express my belief in Mr. Stephen Phillips's poem 
on Gladstone, as being an exquisite tribute to the mem- 
ory of the great statesman. 

Among other new books of fiction I may announce 
Mr. Douglas Sladen's " The Admiral," called " a Nelson 
novel"; Mr. Shan F. Bullock's "Paying the Piper"; 
Mr. Robert Machray's "Grace O'Malley"; Mr. Harry 
Lindsay's "The Jacobite"; and Mr. W. H. Tirebuck's 
" Meg of the Scarlet Coat." I also hear of a new vol- 
ume of short stories by Miss M. E. Wilkins, entitled 
"Silence"; an English society novel by Mrs. Burton 
Harrison, "Two Men and a Girl"; and a Quaker story 
by Mrs. Amelia E. Barr, " I, Thou, and the Other One." 
The two last are to be issued by Mr. T. Fisher Unwin.

COMMUNICA TION. 

DEMOCRACY AND LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

If democratic polity be defined as a government of 
the people, by the people, and for the people, democratic 
literature may likewise be defined as a literature of the 
people, by the people, and for the people. The tendency 
of literature in a democratic civilization to become 
wholly popular is very evident. The author is every- 
where asked to appeal to the taste of the greatest num- 
ber, and the standing of authors is more and more 
determined by the vote of the majority. Newspapers 
and periodicals, aiming at hundreds of thousands of 
readers, offer to writers of ability large payments, pro- 
vided they conform to the popular standard; and pub- 
lishers more and more demand light and quick circulat- 
ing books adapted to the popular taste. The populace 
will not rise to the author; he must come down to them. 
Hence the conscientious litterateur who seeks merely the 
highest and best expression of his own thought, regard- 
less of popular demand, is more and more apt to be 
neglected by democratic civilization. 

The general result of popular pressure on literature 
is mediocrity and vulgarity. The masses read the ten- 
cent magazine and the Sunday newspaper, and litera- 
ture as a whole feels deeply the enormous success of 
these agencies in a general lowering of standard, in a 
turning to merely superficial and coarse effects. The 
vulgarization of the drama has its parallel in the vul- 
garization of literature. Smartness and cleverness win 
the day. The populace would enslave the author to 
play the buffoon for them, or to tickle their palate with 
highly seasoned messes; and the reward of this service 
is a wide popularity and a high compensation. Too often 
the author is induced to abandon his ideals and serve 
the Philistines. And so, instead of the quiet, patient, 
leisurely toil by which alone the masterpiece is evolved, 
the author scratches along at lightning-stroke, striving 
to keep up with the ever-hastening wave of popularity. 
Thus the writer gives up his individuality and freedom 
to conform to the crude tastes of a thoughtless public. 

The psychological rationale of this degradation of 
literature lies primarily in the overweening conceit and 
presumption of a democracy where every man thinks 
himself as good as anyone else, and perhaps a little 



better. This vulgar assertion of equality implies a neg- 
lect and contempt for all that is distinguished and 
superior, that is, for all high art, literature, morals, 
and religion. Further, the stress of cosmopolitan com- 
petition in our great centres so harasses and wearies that 
many have no time nor inclination for cultivating an 
elevated taste, but seek the easiest diversion in the vau- 
deville show and the sensational story. 

On the other hand, we must acknowledge there is a 
vast popular improvement toward culture, as is shown 
in such enterprises as Chautauqua classes, university 
extension, etc. And it is interesting to note that our 
" department stores " dispose of Shakespeare and Emer- 
son by the carload. Certainly every honest attempt, 
however awkward, to rise above sheer Philistinism is 
most praiseworthy, and encourages hope so far; yet it 
cannot be doubted that mere popularism is an increas- 
ingly powerful factor in controlling the yearly output of 
literature. 

Now, when the many decide to read only what most 
easily and directly pleases them, they put an end to the 
function of the literary critic. And it is certainly true 
that sound and sober criticism of a high type has less 
and less to do in determining the publication and circu- 
lation of a book. The public pay little heed to the voice 
of the critic, but they know a good thing when they 
find it, and eagerly devour it, whether it be good, bad, 
or indifferent from a strict literary standpoint. Hence 
a thorough-going democracy in literature, that is, the 
election of writers to the highest rank merely by the 
votes of the majority, means the extinction of the 
critic. And yet we know that literature, like all art, 
has been determined, in all its higher forms at least, by 
the consensus of critics, by the united appreciation of 
superior minds of special insight and training. Now, 
consensus of specialists is the method of appraisement in 
all spheres. Particularly in science and the practical 
arts, and in all progressive and advanced civilization, it 
is the expert that counts; and hence it must be consid- 
ered as retrogressive for literature to be determined 
mainly by the uncultivated and untrained many. But 
the man who neglects the direction of the professional 
critic in his reading is doing as foolishly as the man 
who neglects the direction of the oculist as to using his 
eyes. The reader who follows the instructions of Mathew 
Arnold will come out far better than he who follows his 
own crude tastes. 

In conclusion, we may ask what can be done to save 
literature in this general lowering of standard in a 
democratic civilization. We see what the endowed 
presses of universities and societies do for high-grade 
scientific writings to-day, and we must look to some- 
thing of this sort to help high-grade literature. We see 
what the French Academy has done, both positively in 
setting a high standard, and negatively in its incentive 
to distinguished litterateurs like Daudet and Zola who 
never attained its portals. We see also what the Salon 
does for French art, both positively and negatively. An 
Academy is likely to become a clique, but it ever incites 
to far better work than the merely popular. Possibly 
two competing Academies, one conservative, the other 
advanced, would best secure the interests and progress 
of literature as a fine art. At least if litterateurs would 
form definite and general cooperative associations, as do 
the craftsmen in other fine arts, they would be far less 
tempted to be dragged down by popularism.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VERY 
MODERN LITERATURE.* 

The spirit of international interest in litera- 
ture has grown greatly in the last twenty-five 
years, and especially, we are inclined to think, 
in this country. It may not be really keener 
than it was in the earlier half of the century, 
when " the French," " the German," and " the 
Spanish " were read and studied by many a 
cultivated circle, but it is certainly more wide- 
spread. It is assumed now that there will be 
a considerable current curiosity in regard to the 
work of a Eussian or a Polish novelist, of a 
Norwegian or a Spanish dramatist, not to speak 
of whatever new may appear in French, Ger- 
man, or Italian. Indeed, unless a man is going 
to be satisfied with translations he must be 
master of all the tongues of Europe. 

There is, probably, more of this feeling in 
America than elsewhere, because we Americans 
travel more than Europeans, and so, although 
we do not by any means become better linguists, 
we are apt at least to have a more vigorous 
curiosity in international matters. When you 
add to this the fact of foreign influence in our 
own literary work, and the ordinary post- 
Darwinian desire to see how things came to be 
as they are, you have reason for a considerable 
interest in a history of contemporary foreign 
literature. But such a history is not very easy 
to get at. There are histories of French and 
German literature in the present century, writ- 
ten by our own scholars. There are also some 
books in French and German ; but, on the 
whole, one has had to depend largely on collec- 
tions of essays. Under these circumstances, 
M. Georges Pellissier's " Le Mouvement Lit- 
teraire au XIXe Siecle " was a book of great 
interest, and Mrs. Brinton has done our reading 
public a considerable service by translating it. 

We shall not go into a detailed criticism. 
That would seem something of an impertinence. 
M. Pellissier is a professor in one of the lycees, 
and also a writer of consideration on the his- 
tory of French literature. His work has been 
considered by M. Bmnetiere, and considered 
to be, on the whole, good. We shall do well, 
we suspect, instead of taking issue with M. 
Pellissier on one or two points where we allow

teenth Century. By Georges Pellissier. Authorized Transla- 
tion by Anne Garrison Brinton. New York : G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. 



ourselves to differ with him, if we point out 
some of the reasons why the course of French 
literature in the present century is of particular 
interest to readers of English literature. 

France in the present century has occupied 
rather a singular position so far as art and let- 
ters are concerned, or to be more accurate, 
so far as painting and prose are concerned. 
She first absorbed and then gave out. At the 
beginning of the century she was herself power- 
fully influenced in both respects. So far as 
England was concerned, however, France prac- 
tically did not count ; Germany was the foreign 
influence in letters, and Rome in painting. 
Between 1800 and 1850 no literary influence 
of importance came from France to England, 
nor was English practice or precept, so far as 
painting was concerned, disturbed by any fash- 
ion that might excite the Quartier Latin. Now- 
adays things have changed very much ; we need 
not do more than mention the influence of 
French painting at the present day. We are 
at present concerned only with the impression 
which French prose has made upon English. 
But we think in both directions the most strik- 
ing indication of the change is to be found in 
the position of Mr. Ruskin. In 1860 Mr. 
Ruskin was at his apogee, so far as popular 
estimation is concerned, both as to manner and 
matter. Now, his views on painting are utterly 
condemned by crowds of young artists, and his 
prose style is already classic. We incline to 
think that if it had not been for the influence 
of Paris, Mr. Ruskin would still be the great 
art-critic of the day, and Stevenson, Mr. Henry 
James, and Mr. Hardy would have produced 
works very different from those we know. 

The great English influence in art of our 
time has been the pre-Raphaelite movement, 
and with the early pre-Raphaelites Mr. Ruskin 
was in sympathy. But then came Manet and 
Zola, and looking back over the forty years we 
can see that though Realism by no means dis- 
possessed the natives, it did at least wholly 
check the free development of pre-Raphaelitism 
in painting and in prose. So far as principle 
is concerned, the two are about as different as 
Tweedledum and Tweedledee. But in the 
working out, each goes its own way. 

When we speak of French influence, we do 
not necessarily mean influence of contemporary 
literature. So far as Mr. Henry James is con- 
cerned, for instance, he is, in a way, like M. 
Paul Bourget, but of course not much influ- 
enced by him ; rather might one say that the 
two are affected by the same influences. As 



376 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



for Stevenson, it is not very probable that his 
affectations of vocabulary and figure came from 
the Des Goncourts ; both probably were influ- 
enced by the same previous forces. Mr. Thomas 
Hardy, however, in his later work, was in all 
probability as directly the result of Naturalism 
as need be desired. And so far as lesser men 
are concerned, there are unnumbered examples 
of those who have absorbed the ideas current 
in French literature, often without knowing it, 
and probably more here than even in England, 
where just now native influences have been 
cropping out. 

But we do not mean to indicate that France 
at the beginning of the century received ideas 
on art from England and Germany, and that 
at the end of the century England and Germany 
receive ideas on art from France. That would 
be but a distant approximation to the truth ; 
nor, if it were the truth itself, would it be a 
matter of more than gentle historical interest, 

a matter of some interest to the French, but 
not so much to us. The real fact would rather 
seem to be this : that not only at the beginning 
of the century did France gain ideas, but at all 
times. Byron, Scott, Shakespeare, the German 
romanticists at first doubtless, but then later, 
Poe, Turgenieff, George Eliot, Tolstoi, Ibsen, 

during the century France has always taken 
its literary ideas wherever it has found them, 
just as in another direction she is willing to get 
whatever there is from the Japanese, the pre- 
Raphaelites, the German Christian painters. 
And it is not now only that France is, or rather 
has been, an influence. In fact, nowadays, 
when France is rather fascinated by this or that 
Norwegian, German, Englishman, there are 
who say that it is but the influx again of the 
very ideas which influenced Europe in the days 
of George Sand, Flaubert, and Dumas fils. 

And this is the important matter, for this is 
so typical of the culture of our own time. Our 
century has more and more inclined to an 
amendment of Matthew Arnold's dictum so as 
to read " the best that is now being thought 
and said." More in France than in any other 
country is the cosmopolitan tendency of which 
we spoke at the beginning of this article effec- 
tive in literature, and effective in the right 
direction, namely, toward literary influence and 
not toward literary imitation. So, because it 
gives an account of a truly modern literature 
and from a modern standpoint, will this book 
of M. Pellissier's be of great interest in this 
country. It enables us to study a very sensi- 
tive and very active national mind. 



M. Pellissier writes this book as a realist. 
Not as a violent naturalist, of course nowadays, 
but as what we might call a neo-idealist, 
namely, a realist purged of the grossness of 
naturalism and quickened by the legacies of 
romanticism. And, naturally, this fact gives 
a tone to the book. But it is hardly more than 
a tone ; nor would one have expected that it 
would have been otherwise. 

EDWARD E. HALE, JR. 



AN AMERICAN CHANCELLOR OF LAW.* 

Chancellor Kent was a student rather than 
a man of affairs. His life presents so little 
incident that it furnishes scant materials for a 
biography. His " Memoirs and Letters," col- 
lected and arranged by his great-grandson, 
William Kent, are published in commemora- 
tion of the fiftieth anniversary of his death. 
Much of the material consists of memoranda 
and letters ; the book is therefore largely auto- 
biographical. Kent's early life affords glimpses 
of Yale College, where he was graduated in 
1781. His college training was supplemented 
by systematic and laborious courses of reading, 
which were continued through life. This vol- 
ume contains many notes of this reading. The 
most striking thing about them is that, of all 
the books read, none, barring Adam Smith, 
Grotius, and possibly Puffendorf, would now 
be referred to by anyone for any purpose : so 
rapidly does a literature become obsolete. 
Much of the " Memoirs " is devoted to Kent's 
charming domestic life, which began with an 
early marriage and lasted until his death. 

The contested election for the governorship 
of New York, in 1792, was the turning-point in 
Kent's career. The canvassers appointed by 
the legislature " counted in " Clinton by reject- 
ing the returns of certain counties. Kent's vig- 
orous support of Jay in the Assembly offended 
his constituents, and he was soon afterward 
defeated for Congress. His political prospects 
seemed for the moment to have been blighted. 
He had, however, gained the favor of Jay, 
whose influence probably procured Kent's ap- 
pointment to the law lectureship in Columbia 
College ; and when Jay afterwards became 
Governor, Kent became a Master in Chancery, 
Eecorder, and in 1798 a Judge of the Supreme 
Court. Thus a single event turned him from

William Kent. Boston : Little, Brown, & Co.

THE DIAL 



377 



a political to a judicial career, and thus largely 
did personal influences shape the course of his 
life. When Chief Justice Lewis became Gov- 
ernor, he advanced Kent to the vacancy that 
his own election to the governorship had cre- 
ated. The anecdote is told that Lewis jokingly 
said to Kent before the election, " If you will 
vote for me, I will make you Chief Justice, if 
I am elected." Kent replied, " No, sir ; though 
I admire you personally, I utterly detest your 
political principles." Nevertheless, he received 
the appointment. In 1814 Kent was made 
Chancellor, and continued in this office until 
1823, when he had reached his sixtieth year, 
the age limit for judges as the State Constitu- 
tion then stood. Upon his retirement from the 
bench, Chancellor Kent resumed his law lec- 
tures at Columbia College, which he later issued 
as his " Commentaries on American Law." 
Thus briefly may be told almost the whole story 
of his life. 

Chancellor Kent was a strong Federalist, the 
friend and ardent admirer of Hamilton and a 
bitter enemy of Burr. The author of these 
memoirs tells an anecdote, which he says is 
current in family traditions, that illustrates the 
Chancellor's hatred of Burr. Meeting him one 
day on the street, after Burr's return to this 
country, he exclaimed, " You are a scoundrel, 
sir, a scoundrel." Burr, checking his anger 
and bowing graciously, replied, " The opinions 
of the learned Chancellor are entitled to the 
highest consideration," and passed on. Kent 
was emphatically a " gentleman of the old 
school." His political opinions would be very 
unpopular to-day. In 1830 he wrote Webster : 
" All theories of government that suppose the 
mass of the people virtuous, and able and will- 
ing to act virtuously, are plainly Utopian, and 
will remain so until the Saturnian age." This 
is the attitude that caused the downfall of fed- 
eralism. The language of the Chancellor's let- 
ters is in the fashion of the first half of the 
century, and sounds stilted in modern ears. 
His frank opinions of his contemporaries were 
probably never intended to be made public. 
Of Sumner he wrote in 1840, " He talks inces- 
santly, and is inflated with exaggerated ego- 
tism "; but afterwards he speaks of him more 
favorably. Altogether the book is a pleasant 
one. The last fifty pages give as an appendix 
Chancellor Kent's " Memories of Alexander 
Hamilton," which seem to us not to possess the 
importance that the editor appears to attach to 
them.

PROBLEMS OF EXCHANGE AXD TRADE.* 

The first volume of Professor Nicholson's 
Political Economy, which deals with Produc- 
tion and Distribution, appeared in 1893. The 
author then stated that it was his intention to 
cover the same ground covered by Mill : to 
re-state, in fact, Mill's teachings in the light 
of the criticism of later writers and of the de- 
velopment of economic theory since Mill's time. 
Professor Nicholson's second volume is devoted 
to Exchange; and, as in the earlier volume, 
the scope of the work and many of the divis- 
ions of the subject-matter again bear a general 
resemblance to Mill. At this point, however, 
the resemblance ends. The " dismal science " 
has made some progress since 1848, and it is 
doubtful if Mill would recognize in Professor 
Nicholson's book a re-statement of the princi- 
ples laid down in his own work of half a cen- 
tury ago. " Monopoly values " and " quasi- 
rent s " would have sounded strange to a man 
given to reasoning as though competition was 
the sole regulator of industry, and whose only 
notion of a rent was that of the unearned incre- 
ment due to the unequal degrees of productivity 
of land. 

While not rejecting altogether the marginal- 
utility theory of value, and while acknowledg- 
ing the importance of distinguishing between 
total and final utility, and even admitting that 
" it is the marginal utility that determines mar- 
ginal expenditure," Professor Nicholson urges 
that these facts are of little importance in a 
discussion of exchange value. Exchange val- 
ues do not depend on utility alone, and while 
money measures exchange value, it does not 
measure the respective utilities secured by the 
two parties to an exchange. Neither marginal 
utility nor total utility can be measured by a 
money standard. " We can obtain from the 
records the precise rates of exchange, but as 
regards the feelings of the buyers and sellers, 
or the utilities and disutilities acquired or en- 
dured through the exchanges, the records are 
silent." Utility and exchange value are essen- 
tially different. 

The central point in our author's theory of 
exchange, " the fundamental principle " to 
which he has constant recurrence in his reason- 
ing, is the proposition that " relative prices 
must be adjusted to relative values." If, tak- 
ing gold as our standard, the prices of all com- 
modities are fixed in terms of the standard, and,

olson. Volume II. New York : The Macmillan Co.

[June 16, 



owing to causes directly affecting this standard, 
a change from one level of prices to another is 
made, the change must, " when equilibrium is 
restored, leave relative values unaffected, ex- 
cepting always the relative value of the stand- 
ard itself." The relative values are determined 
by real causes, and money is only the instru- 
ment by which they are measured. 

Professor Nicholson's own illustration will 
make this point clear. Under normal circum- 
stances, the average ox is worth more than the 
average sheep, and " whatever be the movement 
in general prices, whether index numbers fall 
or rise, unless there are particular influences 
affecting the demand and supply of either, the 
relative value of the ox and sheep will remain 
unchanged." But although the adjustment ulti- 
mately comes about, during the process of tran- 
sition from one level of prices to another, some 
commodities will feel the effect more than oth- 
ers, and there will thus be a real disturbance 
in value due to the movement in prices. The 
losses to some lines of business may become 
very serious during this transition period, and 
although there is a gain to other individuals, 
for society as a whole the gains are seldom equal 
to the losses. It is for this reason that " sta- 
bility in the standard of value is preferable 
either to appreciation or depreciation." 

In his discussion of the quantity theory of 
money, the author makes use of the fundamen- 
tal principle that relative prices adjust them- 
selves to relative values, to explain why a gen- 
eral rise of prices caused by an inflation of 
credit will cause a demand for more metallic 
money. Even where wholesale transactions are 
effected mainly by credit instruments, the pay- 
ment of wages and many retail transactions 
demand " cash " in the form of metal or of 
notes resting on metallic reserves which must 
be increased with the increase of the notes rest- 
ing upon them. As the rise of general prices, 
therefore, carries with it a rise in retail prices 
and wages, more cash will be required. The 
need of more metallic money is also caused by 
the demands of foreigners who come to sell in 
the dearest market and must be paid in metal- 
lic money. A third drain on metallic reserves 
is made by the demand for precious metals for 
use in the arts ; for the higher wages and profits 
which follow the rise in prices make possible 
greater expenditures for ornaments, and these 
exceptional demands must fall upon the metals 
used as money in some form. 

The principle that relative prices adjust 
themselves to relative values applies not only 



to one country but to all countries taken to- 
gether if they have commercial and financial 
connections. The particular level of prices, 
when once all contracts, etc., have become ad- 
justed to the level, is a matter of indifference. 
The adjustment, however, made necessary when- 
ever there is a passage from one level to another 
" involves serious practical difficulties and so- 
cial disturbances." 

Professor Nicholson has long been known as 
one of the most ardent and able of the advocates 
of international bimetallism. He has supported 
it not only on theoretical grounds, but in an 
address delivered in 1887 at the Manchester 
AthenaBum, and which was published in his 
" Money and Monetary Problems," he claimed 
for the scheme that it was " both advantageous 
and practicable." It will therefore be of interest 
to see how far the changes, economic and polit- 
ical, which have caused the rapid fall in the price 
of silver since 1890, and which have made gold 
monometallists out of several prominent bimet- 
allists, have caused Professor Nicholson to alter 
or modify his previous views. He seems, indeed, 
to have been not unaffected by the trend of 
historical happenings in finance since 1893. 
The reasons which make bimetallism desirable 
appear to him to be as potent now as they were 
ten years ago ; and it is worth noting that he 
thinks that stability of prices is not the most 
" palpable and obvious " advantage, if it is the 
most real one, which would result from the 
adoption of an international agreement. " For 
one who sees the effect of a fall in general prices, 
there are ten thousand who see the effect of a 
fall in the rate of interest." But on the grounds 
of practicability, the author expresses himself 
more reservedly than in the earlier writing. In 
1887 he stated that : 

" The only obstacle to general bimetallism is the pub- 
lic opinion of this country [Great Britain], and public 
opinion is rapidly turning in its favour, simply because 
the merits of the proposal are every day becoming more 
widely known and appreciated. ... It seems, then, 
that we have only to give our proposals plenty of light 
and air, to put them before the public in the plainest 
manner possible, and the details of the method of action 
will soon be decided." 

In the present work, although he continues to 
assert that " an agreement on the part of the 
principal commercial nations to adopt bimetal- 
lism would in many respects be much more sim- 
ple than is generally supposed," Professor Nich- 
olson realizes more fully the difficulties which 
lie in the way of this agreement, and acknowl- 
edges that an attempt on the part of banks or 
of governments to collect gold reserves might 



1898.] 



379 



lead to a drain on the gold reserve of the Bank of 
England and cause a premium on gold. " Thus 
the simplicity of an international bimetallic 
arrangement consequent on the absence of penal 
causes and the reliance on options may be under 
certain circumstances a source of weakness." 
Added to this difficulty is " the vis inertia of 
popular prejudice," which objects to tampering 
with the currency. But besides the practical 
difficulties which stand in the way of interna- 
tional bimetallism, the author is not firmly con- 
vinced that the double standard should be 
adopted to-day. Many of the evils caused by 
the single standard cannot now be undone. 
Readjustment is almost complete, and certainty 
in the standard is of more importance than 
mere stability of value. At the same time, he 
warns us that " just as protection met its potato 
famine, the gold standard may meet its famine, 
and possibly the financiers of England may 
prefer the adoption of international bimetallism 
to the adoption of a silver standard by the 
United States." 

The book contains interesting chapters on 
the development of markets and the historical 
development of foreign trade, and a more 
lengthy discussion of the foreign exchanges and 
the theory of foreign trade. 

There has long been a lack of an English 
treatise which should give a satisfactory discus- 
sion of the theory of Exchange ; and while some 
of the views presented by Professor Nicholson 
may not find general acceptance, yet on the 
whole this second volume of the Principles of 
Political Economy comes nearer to supplying 
the want than any book written in English 
which has appeared within the quarter-century.

CHAPTERS IN THE ART OF WAR.* 

The purpose of the series of works dedicated 
to and published under the name of the Com- 
mander-in-chief of the British Army, and edited 
by Captain Walter H. James, is to provide a 
storehouse of military learning from which the 
studious subaltern or his superior officer may 
acquire familiarity with the methods of great 
generals and the solutions of grave problems of 
war. In the initial volume of the series, Cap-

tain James translates with skill and care the 
sterling account given by General von Verdy of 
the life he led in the Royal headquarters from 
the beginning to the end of the Franco- German 
war, as the chief of a section of the general 
staff. This book, accessible for some time in 
its own language, is an important contribution 
to history, revealing as it does the inner detail 
of that wonderful fighting machine which 
caught and held the French people as in a vice 
until they had given up a pair of provinces and 
a milliard of money. It is curious to compare 
the mobilization of the German army in 1870 
with that of the American troops now going on. 
And the report of the process whereby our 
farmers and mechanics and clerks are converted 
into efficient and intelligent soldiers, to be made 
by the German experts now in this country, 
will be more curious still. 

Another volume of the series is devoted to 
" Indian Frontier Warfare." This work con- 
tains, among other things, an account, not too 
detailed yet fairly exhaustive, of the method 
adopted by the French Revolutionary general, 
Hoche, for the pacification of La Vendee : a 
method which Sir Frederick Roberts took as 
his model during the reduction of Burmah in 
1886, with the most brilliant success. Briefly 
considered, Hoche was confronted with the 
problem of a small, irregular, and illusive army 
of insurgents, indigenous to the soil and sus- 
tained by it, operating over a wide territory the 
inhabitants of which were amicably disposed to 
them when not actively enlisted among them. 
Establishing fortified camps, with his small 
force General Hoche gradually extended the 
sphere of their influence, taking into temporary 
possession the cattle of district after district, as 
well as the principal men among the Vendeans, 
these being held until all the arms were deliv- 
ered within the neighborhood. Step by step he 
thus brought a stubborn people under complete 
subjection, his own force being self-sustaining, 
though in no way ravaging or desolating the 
land. Nothing could show the incompetence of 
Spain better than the rejection whether 
through ignorance or design is immaterial by 
Campos, Weyler, and Blanco successively, of so 
humane and effective a plan for the extinguish- 
ment of the Cuban rebellion. In Weyler's case 
it meant not only the dismissal without trial of 
a famous method, given new renown after 
almost a century's interval by so brilliant an 
administrator as Sir Frederick Roberts, but 
the sacrifice of an innocent population. 

It is not out of place here to commend both

these works for the clarity and simplicity of 
style which so frequently characterize the writ- 
ings of English-speaking soldiers and sailors. 
Woolwich and Sandhurst, like West Point and 
Annapolis, teach no literature qua literature. 
Yet Grant, Wolseley, and other renowned sol- 
diers, write in admirable English. It is certain 
that these military schools do, on the other 
hand, inculcate a habit of body and mind, and 
a tone which we may call professional for lack 
of a better word, meaning thereby a certain 
single-heartedness and unity of aim, found in 
the man of battle as perhaps nowhere else. 
May we not find here another proof that the 
secret of style lies, after all, in character ?

IN THE REALM OF THE BIBLE.* 

Prof. H. G. Mitchell in 1893 edited a valuable 
essay on Amos, and he now gives us a volume of 
263 pages, containing a study of the first twelve 
chapters of Isaiah. This present attempt is made for 
the popular Bible student. The author has indus- 
triously rounded up all of the chief authorities on 
these twelve chapters, and has appropriated, though 
not slavishly, the best that each possessed for his 
purpose. His introductory chapters, on Isaiah, his 
times and his prophesies, are rather out of the reach 
of the ordinary student, because of their density, 
brevity, and fragmentariness. His translation is 
well done, except that now and then we have some 
arbitrary handling of the text. The commentary, 
which occupies the larger part of tbe book, is rich ; 
and full of references to and quotations from the 
best writers. With all this, the author is by no 
means devoid of independent judgment. The one 
thing in which we cannot fully agree with him is 
the persistency with which he follows in the wake of

such interpreters as Duhm and Cheyne. The norm 
by which the genuine and the non-genuine passages 
are separated could not stand the test in the realm 
of pure literary criticism. Wherever there is spe- 
cial need of philological or archaeological arguments, 
the author has wisely dropped them to foot-notes. 
Aside from the tendency to arbitrariness, the volume 
will do valuable service in the popular interpretation 
of these early chapters of the sublime prophet. 

Egypt is the treasure-house of ancient oriental 
lore. Dr. Fradenburgh, the author of " Light from 
Egypt," has not shut his eyes, nor written his book 
out of his inner consciousness. The last fifteen 
years of Egyptian research under the auspices of 
the Egyptian Exploration Fund have poured count- 
less treasures on the counters of modern civilization. 
These have been published, with detailed explana- 
tions, in about twenty quarto and folio volumes, 
lavishly illustrated with artistic cuts and half-tones 
of the monuments. The expensiveness and inacces- 
sibility of these books set our author to work to cull 
out, condense, and put into popular form the best 
and most startling results revealed in those volumes. 
This popularization, though not the same that any- 
one else would make, displays quite good judgment 
in its selection of material and in its presentation for 
the popular reader. 

Dr. Charles Roads has found " The Gospel of 
Paul " a pat theme for his little book. He has a 
capital idea, but it is poorly executed. The testi- 
mony of Paul to Jesus is classified by him under 
sixteen heads ; but in these chapters he attempts to 
give a connected discourse, at the same time omit- 
ting the source of each paragraph until he reaches 
the end of the chapter, where he puts all the refer- 
ences together. This is confusing to a reader who 
always desires to know the sources of his quotations. 
Besides, it does not aid in more closely connecting 
the different series of quotations. The most admir- 
ably arranged part of the book is the " Harmony " 
on the last few pages, in which we have a conspectus 
of the four gospels and of Paul's testimony to Christ. 
This is of real value, in spite of the fact that now 
and then we could not agree with his selection. 

The book entitled " The Hebrews in Egypt and 
their Exodus " may be regarded as a game of chess 
or chance with figures. The author became so u thor- 
oughly disgusted with biblical commentators and the 
latest historians, whether orthodox or skeptical," 
that he casts them all aside. Without prepossession 
or prejudice, he states that he attempted to unravel 
the records for himself. With Graetz as his para- 
gon, and Dr. Charles S. Robinson in his " Pharaohs 
of the Bondage and the Exodus " as his target, he 
strikes out into the field. He finds no adequate so- 
lution of the problems of the Exodus until he drops 
on the genealogies of the Bible. Now difficulties 
vanish, every event in time and place falls into its 
groove, and we have for the first time a harmonious 
solution of problems which have puzzled scholars 
for ages. This genealogical solvent even sets aside 
such conclusions as those of Naville and Sayce. The

author admits that he is no Hebraist (page 308). 
It is noticeable that he frequently says " if the gen- 
ealogies be authentic," then such and such results 
follow. The book reads as if it were written by 
fragments. We find references to some old out-of- 
date works, and to some new books of value. 

The volume entitled " The Bible and Islam " 
comprises a body of ten lectures delivered on the 
Ely Foundation to the students of Union Theolog- 
ical Seminary, New York City, by the Rev. Henry 
Preserved Smith, D.D. The Influence of the Old 
and New Testaments on the religion of Mohammed 
has engaged some of the foremost Semitic scholars 
of our day. The two schools of interpreters are 
(1) those who believe that they find in Judaism the 
sources of Islamism, and (2) those who trace it back 
to Christian sources. Dr. Smith belongs to the sec- 
ond school, and in his lectures amply proves his 
case. Of course, we must take into consideration 
the fact that the Christianity of the sixth and sev- 
enth centuries, especially in the Arabian peninsula, 
was a defective type in comparison with that of 
the second century in Asia Minor, or that of the 
nineteenth century. Mohammed knew only the 
defective type. The discussion, then, occupies 
itself wholly with the Koran and its teachings, and 
does not touch later phases of Islamism, as the title 
would imply. The author discovers that the Koran 
teaches " the unity of God, the certainty of judg- 
ment, the fact of revelation, God's will to save men, 
and good works the fruit of faith." Mohammed's 
"system is a Judaistic Christianity adapted to Arabic 
conditions" (page 317). Because of its large element 
of truth, we witness its great power over men. In 
a sense, it is a preparation for the larger truths of 
Christianity, in which men are elevated, ennobled, 
and enriched, in life and character. The author 
is fully informed on his theme, candid and fair in 
his estimates, discriminating in his judgment, and 
clear-cut and plain in style. He has presented us 
with a valuable treatise on the live theme of com- 
parative religion. 

The first edition of Professor Driver's " Intro- 
duction to the Literature of the Old Testament" 
appeared in 1891. It struck a popular key, and 
rapidly passed through successive editions. The 
appearance of new literature on the various books 
and critical questions of the Old Testament required 
so many supplementary pages and addenda that for 
this sixth edition the entire book was re-set and 
re-plated. This gave the author an opportunity to 
revise the text. He has notably improved his En- 
glish expression in some places, and, what is more 
important, has introduced into the text recent lit- 
erature on the Old Testament. This has also given 
him an opportunity to discuss in appropriate places 
the critical positions of the newer exponents. The 
author stands substantially where he did in the first 
edition. He still holds an extremely conservative 
position as to the validity of the conclusions of arch- 
aeologists. The most valuable feature, however, in 
this new edition is the full and up-to-date bibliog- 



raphy of each book. The full indices of subjects 
and scripture texts give the volume handy value to 
every student. To facilitate comparison with earlier 
editions, the author has inserted the pagination of 
those editions in bracketed black-faced figures. This 
is now by far the best Old Testament Introduction 
in the English language. 

In the year 1891, Dr. Washington Gladden edited 
a small popular work on " Who Wrote the Bible?" 
He now presents a little book entitled " Seven Puz- 
zling Bible Books," which aims to supplement the 
earlier one, in that it discusses more in detail than 
was possible in the earlier work, the books of Judges, 
Esther, Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Daniel, and 
Jonah. The author takes his positions, for the most 
part, in the shelter of the guns of Driver and Farrar. 
In a careful reading of the discussions, one cannot but 
see the pleadings of an advocate. It is the province 
of such treatments to examine both sides of a ques- 
tion, and on evidence to reach a conclusion. But 
our author is too ready to specify as difficulties some 
points which would readily yield to a careful, minute 
study of the whole situation. Again, he is not careful 
enough in his own statements. He assumes an 
erroneous interpretation (on page 228), and then 
files an objection to it. On page 230 he says, " The 
fifth chapter is a dramatic picture of the downfall 
of Babylon," and immediately strikes at its histor- 
icity ; while the fact is that there is nothing but a 
tradition to back up his statement. Babylon is not 
mentioned as the place of that feast. Again, the 
historical character of Belshazzar is assailed, though 
firmly established by the cuneiform inscriptions of 
the reign of Nabonidus. That he was the king's 
son is also definitely known by Nabonidus' own 
statement in his annalistic tablet. But space for- 
bids further notice of details. Suffice it to say, 
while this volume presents many truly reasonable, 
and, among scholars, widely accepted opinions, it 
also sets forth views and positions which are as yet 
merely unproved theories and misleading hypoth- 
eses. 

Mr. W. D. Crockett has made a new tool for 
students and readers of the Old Testament, in his 
"Harmony of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles." 
And yet it is not new, for others have done the 
same thing. The material of these six books is 
broken into five parts : (1) until the founding of 
the monarchy, (2) the reign of Saul, (3) the reign of 
David, (4) the reign of Solomon, and (5) the king- 
doms of Judah and Israel. These five divisions are 
minutely sectioned and subsectioned until the mere 
outline itself covers forty-five pages. The general 
plan of the work is that adopted in Stevens's and 
Burton's " Harmony of the Gospels." The arrange- 
ment of the first four parts required little more 
than the scissors-and-paste method. But the fifth 
part, covering the period of the dual kingdom, pre- 
sents a series of problems equal to the best-trained 
expert. It is just here that Mr. Crockett's work 
shows its weakness. It is not clear that he follows 
any known system of chronology. This is, of course,

a source of embarrassment and dissatisfaction to the 
reader. His disregard of the indisputable chrono- 
logical evidence of Assyriology is seen in the intro- 
duction of two interregna, amounting to twenty-nine 
years, in Israel (pages 295 and 307), and one of 
eleven years in Judah (page 293). The Assyrian 
records describe only one invasion of Sennacherib 
(cf. pages 322-24). These irregularities errors 
in chronology are not fatal, but are nevertheless 
just enough to discount the value of much of the 
fifth part of the book. Otherwise this will be a ser- 
viceable work. J BA M PRICE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Hittory of the 
British Navy. 



The second volume of Mr. William 
Laird Clowes's elaborate history of 
" The Royal Navy " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) covers the period extending from 1603 to 
1714. To have brought the narrative down to 1763, 
as originally intended, would have involved, the 
editor states, the expansion of the present instal- 
ment to somewhat unmanageable proportions ; and 
it has therefore been thought best to take the death 
of Queen Anne and the accession of the House of 
Brunswick as a convenient halting place. In Vol- 
ume III., now preparing, and already, as we learn, 
well advanced, Mr. Clowes hopes to carry his work 
as far as the outbreak of the War of the French 
Revolution. What will be the effect upon Mr. 
Clowes's plans of the present unforeseen engage- 
ments of his two American contributors, Captain 
A. T. Mahan and Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, can only 
be surmised. In the present volume, Mr. L. Carr 
Laughton, a son of the veteran naval writer Prof. 
J. K. Laughton, describes, in a concise, straight- 
forward way, the active work of the Navy under 
James I., Charles I., and the Commonwealth ; and 
he has succeeded in throwing a ray of fresh light 
upon the history of the operations of the fleets of 
the early Stuarts, and upon the events of the first 
Dutch War. The record of Voyages and Discoveries 
has again fallen to the share of Sir Clements Mark- 
ham, whose present contribution comprises two suc- 
cinct chapters summarizing the work of exploration 
and discovery from 1603 to 1649, and from 1660 
to 1714. Mr. Clowes's quota consists of chapters 
on the Civil History of the Navy from 1603 to 1649, 
from 1649 to 1660, and from 1660 to 1714, and on 
the major and the minor military operations of the 
Navy from 1660 to 1714. Mr. Clowes has also 
compiled a table of losses of H. M. ships from the 
Revolution to 1714. We have already, in an ex- 
tended notice of Mr. Clowes's opening volume (THE 
DIAL, Sept. 1, 1897) indicated the general aim and 
scope of this important work, which bids fair to 
satisfactorily fill the need of a comprehensive his- 
tory of the British Navy considered as a national 
establishment. The illustrations form an attractive 
as well as instructive feature. They consist in the 



present volume of five portraits in photogravure, 
fifteen full-page plates comprising cuts of famous 
ships, charts, views, and so on, and a great number 
of vignettes. The volumes are separately indexed. 



Victor Hugo 
at revealed in 
hit letters. 



Readers who found Volume I. of M. 
Paul Meurice's edition of " The Let- 
ters of Victor Hugo " somewhat dis- 
appointing, will, we venture to say, be very agreeably 
surprised should they essay the perusal of Volume 
II., just issued by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It 
is a distinct improvement, from every point of view, 
on its rather mediocre predecessor. It serves to 
completely rehabilitate the repute of its author as a 
letter-writer. In it domestic letters are, compara- 
tively speaking, the exception, and letters to emi- 
nent correspondents, whose names alone were an 
inspiration to the writer, are the rule. It was im- 
possible for M. Hugo to be tame or listless when 
addressing Lamartine, Mazzini, George Sand, Cop- 
pe"e, Garibaldi, Gautier, About, Louis Blanc, Ver- 
laine, Sardou, Tennyson, or Swinburne. The vol- 
ume sparkles like a gem with the rays of genius, and 
is transfused with the poet's enthusiasm for the ideal 
for all high aims and enterprises. " If to be an 
idealist," he writes to Lamartine, " is to be a radical, 
then I am one. Yes, from every point of view, I 
understand, I desire, and I hail improvement. . . . 
Yes, a society which tolerates misery, a religion 
which admits hell, a humanity which admits war, 
appear to me to be a society, a religion, and a hu- 
manity of the lower order ; and it is towards the 
society, the religion, and the humanity of a higher 
world that I aspire : society without kings, humanity 
without frontiers, religion without sacred books. . . . 
These are my principles, and that is why I wrote 
Les Mis6rables. In my view, Les Miserables is 
simply a book with fraternity for its starting-point 
and progress for its goal." That this high faith in 
the possibilities of progress, in the political ideals 
born with his century, had its rude shocks and bitter 
disillusionments, is occasionally manifest. In 1859 
Hugo wrote to George Sand : " Just now I am over- 
whelmed with grief. They have killed John Brown. 
And it is a republic that has done this ! Here is a 
free nation putting to death a liberator ! Alas ! my 
heart is indeed sad. The crimes of kings one can 
understand : a king's crime has nothing abnormal 
about it ; but crimes committed by a people are intol- 
erable to the thinker." The volume is, we repeat, 
an eminently characteristic one, containing in satis- 
fying measure those elements in which its predeces- 
sor seemed strangely lacking. 

"The Quest of Happiness" (Rob- 
erto) is an unfinished, yet by no 
means fragmentary, work from the 
pen of Mr. Philip Gilbert Hamerton the last word 
to his fellows of a serene and thoughtful spirit who, 
consciously nearing his end as he wrote, wished be- 
fore departing to shed upon the path of those com- 
ing after him some guiding rays from the lamp of 



1898.]

his own experience. Death arrested the hand of 
the writer, without impairing the value of what he 
had written. Indeed, the very incompleteness of 
the essay seems in a way to chime with its theme ; 
since, as Mr. M. R. F. Gilman, the excellent editor 
of the book, observes, " no completed essay upon the 
incomplete science of human happiness could ever 
wholly satisfy the insatiate heart of humanity." 
Hamerton was penetrated with a strong sense of the 
essential imperfection and illusiveness of things 
mundane ; but when he paused as it were upon the 
threshold of what we venture to term the other 
world, to look back for a moment over the fading 
expanse he had traversed, he saw with the clear and 
comprehensive eye of the traveller who has attained 
a commanding height that this world, with all its 
deceptions and positive ills, is furnished with pro- 
visions for our happiness not a few. Much good 
may be attained and much evil avoided by those 
who shape their course aright; and to furnish in 
some sort a chart for the journey was Mr. Hamer- 
ton's aim in composing the present treatise. The 
volume is the outcome largely of considerations that 
presented themselves to the mind of the author while 
meditating the plan of a work to be called " The 
Life of the Feelings." " The Quest of Happiness " 
was begun early in 1891, but was laid aside until 
1893, when Mr. Hamerton resumed work upon it, 
and had nearly completed it, when a theory of what 
he believed to be " The Real Law of Happiness " 
dawned upon him, and he at once determined to 
re-write the book de novo. He was still at work on 
it, feeling, as we have said, that it was to be his final 
word to his readers, in November, 1894, when he 
died, leaving the closing portion unfinished. The 
classification of chapters is the work of Mrs. Ham- 
erton, from whose charming memoir of her husband 
Mr. Gilman has drawn the material for the bio- 
graphical part of his Introduction. To the thou- 
sands of earnest American men and women who, in 
the face of chilling deprivations and disadvantages, 
aspiring to the higher standards of thought and 
living, have drawn cheer and guidance from the 
lucid pages of Mr. Hamerton's " Intellectual Life," 
we say by all means read too " The Quest of Hap- 
piness." In style it is, as Mr. Gilman thinks, quite 
equal if not superior to its two predecessors, " The 
Intellectual Life " and " Human Intercourse." Its 
philosophy, though elevated, is woven of experience, 
not dreams. It deals with the attainable, and does 
not mock the wayfarer whose feet are glued to earth 
by bidding him scale the inaccessible heights of the 
ideal. 

It is a frequent comment, in the com- 
parison of foreign and American 
universities, that we give the student 
much more guidance and direction than is custom- 
ary abroad. We do not merely set him to browse 
in rich pastures, but take pains to point out the rela- 
tive values of the available materials. As a conse- 
quence, the text-book has reached a marked devel- 



opment with us ; and as a successful writer of 
text-books the American professor is second to none. 
In the department of Psychology, Professor Ladd 
has been a strong influence in the dissemination of 
an intelligent interest in the phenomena of the 
mental life. A larger and a briefer compendium of 
physiological psychology, a primer, a larger and 
now a smaller volume on descriptive psychology, 
have all appeared within a dozen years. These 
volumes are stimulating as well as useful, systematic 
as well as discriminating, scholarly as well as readily 
intelligible. Professor Ladd is probably at his best 
in the description and analysis of the everyday phe- 
nomena which make up the main portion of oar 
mental existence, and in this recent volume, " Out- 
lines of Descriptive Psychology" (Scribner), his 
material bears the mark of thorough congeniality to 
the writer. It is not markedly original, and could 
not readily be so ; but it is able, judicious, and 
interesting. The main purpose of the volume may 
be represented by the following extract ; and it may 
be added with confidence that this important service 
of illuminating the significance of common processes 
the volume will perform with credit. " To the 
unreflecting mind there appears to be no mystery 
about our daily use of the senses. To such a mind 
there is no problem of perception. Illusions and 
hallucinations seem indeed interesting. The phe- 
nomena of hypnotism, telepathy, and so-called spirit- 
ualism, appear profoundly mysterious. But just 
ordinary, everyday seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, 
and feeling of things what that is problematical 
or scientifically interesting can there be in these 
commonplace conscious states? For the genuine 
scientific man and the devoted student of science, 
however, the case is precisely reversed. Ordinary 
perceptions are most interesting, most profoundly 
mysterious. And there is very little doubt that the 
scientific mastery of these will one day give us the 
key to all the wonders in which the lovers of the 
marvellous find their chief delight." 

Mr. W. E. D. Scott's " Bird Studies " 
are issued by Messrs. Putnam's Sons 
in a square quarto volume, heavy 
with the weight of thick calendered paper, fit to 
receive a perfect imprint of the delicate and intri- 
cate illustrations with which the book is lavishly 
furnished. Many of these are full-page plates ; all 
are photographic reproductions of birds and their 
nests, and really form the distinguishing feature of 
the work. Some, taken from life, are of striking 
interest, as that of the wood-thrush sitting on her 
eggs (page 3) ; the series of young bluejays in various 
stages of growth ; the nests of the Baltimore oriole 
and yellow-winged woodpecker ; with others of sim- 
ilar quality. The attempt to illustrate by photo- 
graphing bird skins, technically so-called, is unsatis- 
factory. In many cases it would trouble an expert 
to identify the species thus represented. The letter- 
press of Mr. Scott's volume comprises brief studies 
of the land-birds of Eastern North America, pre-

sented in a plain matter-of-fact style. In a few 
instances original observations are embodied which 
are of value. In the arrangement of his matter, 
the author has chosen to diverge from the customary 
method of classification, and to group the birds of 
which he treats somewhat arbitrarily in reference to 
their favorite localities, " About the House," 
" Along the Highway," " In the Woods," " Fields," 
"Swamps," and by the water-side. Mr. Scott is an 
undoubted lover of feathered creatures, and has 
been their intimate in the haunts which they affect 
in Northern and Southern states. He has been 
careful to make no statement that conflicts with 
accredited authorities in the domain of ornithology. 






The excitement and the charm which, 

thirt 7 7 ears a g were acknowledged 
as attendant upon European travel 
are very naively confessed to in Mrs. Sherwood's 
reminiscences, published under the title of " Here 
and There, and Everywhere " (H. S. Stone & Co.). 
Not all of these are drawn from her initial journey- 
ings, but all are of one type, giving, unconsciously, 
the spirit of a younger and perhaps a more senti- 
mental period than the present. Mrs. Sherwood 
has seen much of the world, its people, places, and 
pageantries ; and her recollections are therefore not 
wanting in raison d'etre. It is something, indeed 
for one with any gift of imagination to have made 
a first visit to Venice when Venice was all festal for 
the Empress Euge'nie ; it is something to have had 
friendship with such a man as Lord Houghton ; and 
there is, doubtless, more than a little flavor in the 
thought of having chatted with the critic Taine and 
the actor Coquelin, or of having dined with a French 
officer of the American army who had known 
Chateaubriand and Madame Becamier and the 
daughter of Marie Antoinette. Yet old West Point 
and old Newport are recalled with as much pleasure 
as are Venice and Florence ; and no royal person- 
age though the book leans to royal personages 
is remembered with more enthusiasm than is Wash- 
ington Irving, to whom Mrs. Sherwood once made 
a morning visit ; or Bancroft, whom she knew well ; 
or that gentle dandy, N. P. Willis, whose taste and 
ability she warmly defends. The book is meant to 
entertain, and must be received in the placid and 
ingenuous spirit in which it is written ; it is not to 
be read by any stickler for literary art, or by any 
of the rigidly unsmiling among critics. 

" The Story of the Nations " (Put- 
nam ) series is appreciably enriched 
by Mr. Andre* Lebon's " Modern 
France," a lucid summary of French internal his- 
tory from 1789 to 1895. M. Lebon is a Member 
of the Chamber of Deputies and a republican of the 
more conservative sort, but we do not perceive in his 
book any marked indications of party bias. To con- 
dense into a small volume of 470 pages anything 
like an adequate outline story of a century so rich 
in ideas and achievements, in men, changes, and 



events, as has been the period under discussion in 
France, calls for an unusual turn for literary com- 
pression, a just sense of proportion, and a clear view 
of the rationale of events. These qualifications M. 
Lebon clearly possesses in due measure. On the 
score of loose or inaccurate statement we have two 
or three rather serious complaints to enter. For 
instance, it is not a little surprising to find M. Lebon 
stating that, on the refusal of Louis to sanction the 
decree against the priests in 1792, " the Girondin 
Cabinet resigned," whereas, as the merest smatterer 
ought to know, the " Patriot Ministers," instead of 
resigning, were dismissed ("kicked out," as Dum- 
ouriez put it) by the king an unusually vigorous 
proceeding on Louis's part, which largely led up to 
the abortive demonstration of June 20. Again, M. 
Lebon, in describing the September Massacres, tells 
us that " the populace stormed the prisons and mur- 
dered nearly a thousand aristocrats and priests " 
a palpably erroneous account of a familiar event, 
which we shall not pay our readers the poor com- 
pliment of correcting. On the whole, however, M. 
Lebon has given us a useful and readable epitome 
of modern French history. There are three special 
chapters on " Letters, Arts, and Sciences," together 
with a page or so of bibliography. Classified tables 
of names and works prominent in the history of the 
literary, artistic, and scientific movement in contem- 
porary France are appended, as well as a chrono- 
logical list of French governments and ministries 
from 1789 to 1895. The volume is acceptably illus- 
trated, and the translation appears to have been done 
with care. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

"The Bookman Literary Year-Book" (Dodd) for 
1898 is the first volume of a new annual publication 
edited by Mr. James Macarthur. Its contents are 
mainly reprinted from the monthly issues of " The Book- 
man," and relate chiefly to " new and prominent writers 
of the year," a somewhat comprehensive designation, 
since it is made to include such men as Messrs. Edward 
Bellamy, Marion Crawford, S. Weir Mitchell, and Hall 
Caine. The section of " Obituaries " includes seven 
sketches, that of Daudet being the longest. Other fea- 
tures are summaries of the book production of the year, 
the principal serials and dramatizations of current fic- 
tion, lists of libraries, book-clubs, and "best books," 
directions for securing copyright and for correcting 
proof. There are a good many portrait illustrations, 
but the publication is, on the whole, a somewhat futile 
one. 

" Choses et Gens d'Ame'rique " (LeVy) is the title of a 
new volume by Madame Blanc (" Th. Bentzon"). Never 
profound, never critical in any deep sense, this amiable 
writer is always pleasant to read, and always contrives 
to find interesting subjects for discussion. Of the five 
papers which make up the present volume, " La Vie de 
Famille en Ame'rique " is the only strictly social study. 
The other four are reviews of books and their writers, 
the subjects being Edward Bellamy, Sidney Lanier, 
Miss Alice French, and Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard.

The study of the latter writer, entitled " Un Loti Ame'r- 
icain " is singularly sympathetic, and once more illus- 
trates the truth that prophets must still seek in other 
countries the honor due them in their own. 

Mr. Henry E. Chambers, in " West Florida and its 
Relation to the Historical Cartography of the United 
States " (Johns Hopkins University Studies), clears up 
the historical mistiness which has so long clung about 
the outlines of the vanished territory of that name. He 
traces the confusion to the rapidly changing ownership, 
naming no less than six changes of ownership and juris- 
diction over the strip in question. He carefully outlines 
and distinguishes between the British, Spanish, and the 
two American West Floridas. He offers proof that the 
United States did not acquire title to land as far east 
as the Perdido with the purchase of Louisiana, but that 
the claim was an ambitious second thought emanating 
from Livingstone, one of the negotiators. 

Recent texts for the study of English include the fol- 
lowing: Four selected books of Pope's "Iliad" (Ginn), 
edited by Mr. William Tappan; Kingsley's "The 
Water-Babies " (Maynard), edited and abridged by 
Miss Edna H. Turpin; "The Shorter Poems of John 
Milton " (Macmillan), edited by Mr. Andrew J. George; 
" Selections from the Poetry of Robert Burns " (Allyn), 
edited by Miss Lois G. Huff ord ; " How to Study Shake- 
speare " (Donbleday), by Mr. W. H. Fleming; with an 
introduction by Dr. Rolfe; " The New Century Speaker 
for School and College " (Ginn), edited by Dr. Henry 
A. Frink; and an "English Etymology" (Heath), by 
Professors Friederich Kluge and Frederick Lutz. 



LiITERARY NOTES. 



"Journalism for Women: A Practical Guide" is the 
title of a timely little volume by Mr. E. A. Bennett, pub- 
lished by Mr. John Lane. 

" The Spectator," in the new and pretty English edi- 
tion imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, has 
now reached its sixth volume. 

" The Glory of the Imperfect," a college address by 
Prof. George H. Palmer, is issued by Messrs. T. Y. 
Crowell & Co. in booklet form. 

" A Legend of Montrose " is the latest volume in the 
exquisite edition of Scott's novels, now being published 
by the Messrs. Dent, and imported by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

" The Story of Photography," by Mr. Alfred T. Story, 
is an interesting and compact little book just published 
by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. in their " Library of 
Useful Stories." 

" The Rise of an Empire," by Sir Walter Besant, is 
published by Mr. M. F. Mansfield. It is one of " a 
series of small books to be devoted to the rise of Brit- 
ain's wealth and power throughout the earth." 

The first regular publication of the " Brothers of the 
Book " of Gouverneur, N. Y., is a daintily-printed little 
pamphlet containing the " Conclusion " from Walter 
Pater's " Renaissance Studies." The booklet is issued 
in a limited edition of 270 copies. 

" The Shorter Poems of John Milton " are edited for 
school nse by Mr. Andrew J. George, and the book is 
published by the Macmillan Co. Mr. George has 
included in this edition a number of the Latin poems, 
and supplied the whole with an extensive body of notes. 

Real bookworms, not metaphorical ones, are the theme 



of the Rev. J. F. X. O 'Conor, S.J., in a small volume 
entitled " Facts about Bookworms," published by Mr. 
Francis P. Harper. The work is attractively printed, 
and some of the illustrations are extremely interesting. 

A tasteful edition of the " Rubaiyfit " is published by 
Mr. William Doxey as the first volume in a new series 
of reprints to be known as " The Lark Classics." The 
volume is of convenient pocket size, the typography 
clear and exact, the binding attractive, and the price low. 

Of the numerous war maps, atlases, charts, etc., lately 
put on the market, altogether the best and the cheapest 
is Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co.'s " War Atlas of the 
World." This publication consists of sixteen large maps, 
with marginal statistics, of all parts of the world con- 
cerned in the present war. 

The Christian Literature Co. are making excellent 
progress in their plan of republishing in cheap form the 
" Sacred Books of the East." We noticed not long ago 
the appearance of the Upanishads in this acceptable 
edition, and we now have Biihler's translation of " The 
Sacred Laws of the Aryas," two volumes made into one 
by means of thin paper. 

We note with pleasure the publication, by Messrs. 
Methuen & Co., London, of the second edition of " Ox- 
ford and its Colleges," by Mr. J. Wells. This dainty 
little book, with its charming illustrations, is of value as 
a guide to the city which it describes, and of much 
interest to the general reader on account of its wealth 
of anecdote and historical fact. 

" The First Philosophers of Greece " is a work im- 
ported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, and described 
as " an edition and translation of the remaining frag- 
ments of the pre-Sokratic philosophers, together with a 
translation of the more important accounts of their opin- 
ions contained in the early epitomes of their works." 
Mr. Arthur Fairbanks is editor and translator. 

" With Fire and Sword," by Mr. Henryk Sienkie wicz, 
now appears in a popular edition at one-half the price 
hitherto fixed, although in point of mechanical execu- 
tion it is almost as desirable as the original form of 
issue. The publishers are Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., 
and we hope they will find it advisable to give us " The 
Deluge " and " Pan Michael " in the same form. 

On the first of the present month, the firm of Messrs. 
Little, Brown, & Co. took possession of practically the 
entire business carried on for some fifty years by Messrs. 
Roberts Brothers. The latter house will continue to 
publish its editions of Balzac and Moliere in English, 
but the other books upon its list will be added to the 
catalogue of the publishers who have thus made two of 
the most important Boston houses into one. 

Professor Pasqnale Villari's "Life and Times of 
Niccolo Machiavelli," as translated by Madame Linda 
Villari, is imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons 
in a new one-volume edition of more than a thousand 
pages. In this form, the work is even more complete 
than in its four- volume issue of fifteen or twenty years 
ago. The price is very moderate, thus bringing this 
valuable work within the reach of every student. 

Dr. William B. Cairns, of the University of Wiscon- 
sin, has published a monograph " On the Development 
of American Literature from 1815 to 1833." Particular 
attention is given to the periodical literature of the 
years surveyed, and a great variety of interesting ma- 
terial has been brought together for convenience of 
reference. We trust that Dr. Cairns will continue the 
important work that he has begun in so scholarly a way.

THE SINGER 

Automatic Chain = stitch 
Sewing=Machine. 

Highest type for all purposes in which a 

chain-stitch can be used. Owing to the simple 
design, the small number of wearing parts, 
and superior material and workmanship, it is 
of remarkable durability and efficiency. 

Especially distinguished for compactness, absolute 
noiselessness, and light-running qualities. 

Adapted to a wide range of work, upon almost any 
variety of fabric. Its capacity under the arm is greater 
than that of any similar machine. 

The frame is cast in one piece, and is remarkably 
rigid and free from vibration. The feed has a positive 
motion, and the length of stitch is easily adjusted with- 
out use of springs. 

The automatic tension always supplies exactly 
the correct length of thread for each stitch, and requires 
no adjustment.

JAMES BRYCE, M. P., 

Author of " The American Commonwealth," 
" Impressions of South Africa" etc. 

NO one is more competent than the Hon. James 
Bryce to review the wonderful career of En- 
gland's great statesman. Mr. Bryce is not only a 
trained writer, but he has been a close friend of 
Mr. Gladstone for many years, serving with him 
in Parliament and in two of his cabinets. 

The material for the book was gathered several 
years ago. It has been revised within a few weeks, 
and will be found to be the very latest and best of 
all the reviews of Mr. Gladstone's career. It shows 
a deep appreciation of the genius of the man. What- 
ever else is written in the future about Mr. Glad- 
stone, this will always be a classic. In attractive 
binding, clear type ; price, $1.00.

" Miss Trumbull's claim to the attention of her readers is undisputed. 
Her short stories possess a freshness, a poignancy and underlying quick- 
witted penetration into human feelings, motives, and experiences that 
give them a peculiar charm. Her choice of themes is such as appeals 
to a wide circle, and her handling of the persons of her imagination is 
exquisite." Hartford Post. 

" In these short stories we find not a little of the delicacy of sentiment 
and trueness of literary touch that are characteristic of Miss Jewett. 
The author's skill in reading and recording character is distinctly strong. 
She knows New England life thoroughly, and the situations brought out 
in the stories are novel and interesting." The Outlook (New York). 

" Very witty and indeed excellent in all ways." London Guardian 

(England).
