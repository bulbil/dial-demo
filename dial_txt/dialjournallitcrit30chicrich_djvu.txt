THE GREAT BOOKS OF THE 
CENTURY. 

On this first day of the twentieth century 
there can be no subject more suitable for dis- 
cussion in the pages of a literary journal than 
that of the famous books produced during the 
century just ended. The subject is one that 
has already received a certain amount of atten- 
tion in other quarters, and that will doubtless 
be handled by many sorts of pens during the 
coming months. It is a subject of deep and 
enduring interest, because it affords one way, 
at least, and probably the most important way, 
of determining what the nineteenth century has 
done for civilization. We propose to confine 
our attention, in the present article, to the 
books of thought as distinguished from the 
books of art, and to enumerate, with some sort 
of brief accompanying comment, some of the 
works of the century that may fairly be char- 
acterized as epoch-making ; the books, in a 
word, that have opened men's eyes to a deeper 
view of scientific or philosophical truth, and 
have made permanent changes in the current 
of human thought. 

Considered in this respect, the book of the 
century, beyond any possibility of a successful 
challenge to its preeminence, is " The Origin 
of Species," by Charles Darwin. The influence 
of this book ranks it with the treatises of Co- 
pernicus and of Newton, with the " Contrat 
Social " and the " Wealth of Nations." It is 
doubtful if any other book, in all the history of 
modern thought, has been so far-reaching in 
its influence, or productive of such immense 
intellectual results. There is a difference, not 
merely of degree but almost of kind, between 
the intellectual processes of the men who lived 
before Darwin and those who have grown to 
manhood during the period in which the evo- 
lutionary leaven has been working in men's 
minds. We no longer think in the same terms 
as of old, and we see that the true measure of 
the power of the great thinkers of the past is 
to be found in the extent to which their work 
foreshadowed or anticipated the evolutionary 
method. 

It is because the influence of Darwin has 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



thus extended far beyond the biological field 
in which his work was done that his most 
famous book stands thus preeminent. Among 
the books that have proved epoch-making in 
more restricted fields of thought, we may men- 
tion Lyell's " Principles of Geology," Helm- 
holtz's " Tonempfindungen," Froebel's " Edu- 
cation of Man," Ruskin's " Modern Painters," 
and Maine's "Ancient Law." The science of 
comparative philology, which hardly existed 
before the nineteenth century, dates from the 
publication of Bopp's " Comparative Gram- 
mar " ; and the scientific pursuit of historical 
scholarship, whose ideals are very different 
from those of the eighteenth century histo- 
rians, although Gibbon did much to anticipate 
them, really began with the publication of 
Niebuhr's " Romische Geschichte." Dalton's 
" New System of Chemical Philosophy " laid 
the foundations for atomic chemistry, and the 
"Mecanique Celeste" of Laplace provided a 
firm mathematical basis for the nebular theory, 
previously outlined, it is true, by Kant, but 
lacking in the confirmation that was brought 
to it by the masterly analysis of the French 
astronomer. Here is also the appropriate place 
for mention of the researches of Pasteur, which 
have proved so immensely fruitful in the do- 
main of bacteriology, and upon which, more 
than upon the labors of any other investi- 
gator, the new science is based. To the 
work of Pasteur and his followers we owe 
the first rational theory of disease and its 
treatment that has ever been formulated, a 
somewhat surprising fact when we consider 
the paramount importance of the subject to 
mankind. 

What were once supposed to be the founda- 
tions of religious belief have, during the cen- 
tury just ended, been sapped and mined by 
many agencies. The study of ancient civiliza- 
tions has proved to be the merest fables many 
things that the credulous' earlier ages accepted 
without question. The new scientific view of 
man and nature has also brought about a silent 
transformation in many matters of opinion 
once thought to be indissolubly connected with 
religious belief, but now seen to have little or 
nothing to do with it. As far as religion is a 
question of the interpretation of the Scriptures, 
the historical methods that have dealt so effect- 
ively with Greek and Roman tradition have 
also made an enduring impression upon the 
traditions of the Hebrew people and of the. 
Christian church. The "higher" criticism, 
which means simply the new historical criti- 



cism of sources and ideas, has triumphed so 
completely that little in the way of superstition 
is left for it to slay. Many men have fought 
valiantly in this cause, and it is difficult to 
specify individual scholars. But if our test 
be that of direct influence upon great numbers 
of people, it is probably true that the " Leben 
Jesu " of Strauss and the " Vie de Jesus " of 
Ren an have been the most important popular 
agencies in bringing about a restoration of the 
Christian religion to its proper place in the 
perspective of general history. 

In the domain of economics, the most influ- 
ential book of the century has probably been 
one whose teachings are repudiated by those 
who have the best right to speak in the name 
of this science. The propaganda of socialism 
has become so marked a feature in the political 
life of most of the civilized nations that it can- 
not be ignored in any survey of the tendencies 
of nineteenth century thought, and credit must 
be given to the book which, more than any 
other, has been responsible for this movement. 
That book, it need hardly be added, is the 
" Kapital " of Karl Marx ; and its force is 
not yet spent. Indeed, we are inclined to 
think that fifty years hence it will loom 
even larger than it now does among the writ- 
ings that have most profoundly influenced the 
thought of modern times. For the socialist 
experiment has not yet worked itself out, and 
it will not be discredited until civilization has 
suffered some very rude shocks. Mill's 
" Political Economy," on the other hand, 
while it has profoundly influenced the real 
thinkers in this field, and has an absolute value 
far exceeding that of " Das Kapital," falls 
short of being an epoch-making book for the 
simple reason that, instead of setting new 
ideas in motion, its energy was devoted to 
clarifying the old ones, and to setting them 
forth in logical arrangement. It is still the 
best single treatise on political economy that 
has ever been written, and for this, at least, it 
deserves an honorable place in any review of 
the intellectual history of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. We are inclined to give a place in this 
connection to the writings upon political and 
social subjects of the great apostle of Italian 
unity, Guiseppe Mazzini. It is not merely 
because they brought about the political regen- 
eration of his own country that these writings 
are of the highest importance although that 
would suffice to justify the estimate but 
rather because they brought the element of 
spirituality into the discussions with which 



1901.] 



THE DIAL, 



they were concerned, and supplemented the 
conception of the rights of man, of which 
something too much had been made during 
the period that followed the French Revolution, 
with the hitherto neglected conception of the 
duties of man, thus giving an ethical turn to 
the general movement of European emancipa- 
tion, and allying it with something higher and 
finer than merely material interests. The 
teaching of Mazzini, enforced by the singular 
purity and nobility of his devoted life, has had 
a widespread influence upon political thought, 
and has given it an ethical impulse that would 
be difficult to overestimate. 

Turning last of all to the philosophers, that 
is, to the men who, as far as may be, take all 
knowledge for their province, and seek to sys- 
tematize the various results of special intel- 
lectual activity, we find the names of Humboldt, 
Hegel, Schopenhauer, Comte, and Mr. Herbert 
Spencer to be the conspicuous names of the 
nineteenth century. The " Kosmos " of 
Alexander von Humboldt marks, in a sense, 
the end of the period of general scholarship 
and the beginning of the period in which 
specialization has held full sway. Never 
again can anyone hope to master the scientific 
knowledge of his time in the sense in which 
Humboldt mastered it ; even the magnificent 
achievement of Mr. Spencer falls short of that 
ideal and shows the futility of any further en- 
deavor in that direction. We owe to Mr. 
Spencer the most thorough-going application of 
the conception of evolution to history that has 
ever been made, and that is glory enough for 
one man ; but we cannot read his " Synthetic 
Philosophy " without at the same time realizing 
that there are gaps in his knowledge and de- 
fects in his philosophical comprehension. We 
have the same feeling in more marked degree 
when we read Comte ; and in his case, while 
recognizing his great influence, we must admit 
that it is an influence no longer active. Even 
the eloquence of Mr. Frederic Harrison cannot 
galvanize the " Cours de Philosophic Positive " 
into any semblance of the life that left it a 
generation ago. Nevertheless, it will always 
be reckoned among the most influential books 
of the century just ended. Taking philosophy 
in the stricter sense, as primarily concerned 
with the ultimate problems of thought, the 
names of Hegel and of Schopenhauer stand 
preeminent in the history of the nineteenth 
century. The " Logic " of the one and " Die 
Welt als Wille und Vorstellung " of the other 
have been the chief metaphysical forces of the 



period, although now, at the end of the period, 
we see that the foimer is a waning influence, 
while the latter is an influence still to be taken 
into account in any study of the forces which 
still sway the minds of thoughtful men. It 
supplies, better than any other metaphysical 
system yet produced, the needed corrective for 
that material view of the universe which would 
seem to be the outcome of modern science, and 
enforces the fundamental teachings of the 
philosophers of Plato, and Spinoza, and 
Berkeley, and Kant in the terms of the 
modern intellect, and with a cogency that is 
irresistible to the logical mind. We are 
inclined to believe that if the " Origin of 
Species " is approached in its influence upon 
nineteenth-century thought by any other one 
book, " Die Welt als Wille und Vorstel- 
lung " is that book. 



THE CASE AT STANFORD 
UNIVERSITY. 

The recent case of alleged "interference with 
the freedom of academic teaching " at Stanford 
University has called oat a range of discussion and 
criticism that seems to us disproportionate to the 
importance of the case. It was, of coarse, to be 
expected that the matter would be made the most 
of by sensation-seeking newspapers, and those of 
California in particular seem to have improved 
their opportunities without much regard to the finer 
equities or to the injury they might be doing the 
institution and those who have made it one of the 
chief glories of their State. Into the details of the 
affair we do not now propose to go. Broadly 
viewed, it seems less a question of academic free- 
dom than of academic common-sense. It appears 
that an instructor was asked to resign his position, 
as he claims, on account of some sentiments, altered 
by him in a public speech, which were objectionable 
to the founder of the University ; as the other side 
claims, on account of an antagonism of long stand- 
ing, aggravated by some offensive reference s to the 
family of the founder, the instructor questioning in 
his class-room the legitimacy of the fortune by 
which the University had been established, while 
not scrupling to accept a portion of the same for- 
tune in payment of his professorial salary. Now 
if these things were true, or Mrs. Stanford believed 
them to be true, her resentment was natural and 
inevitable : and in any event, it seems to us that 
such generous devotion and boundless liberality as 
she has shown to the institution whose welfare lies 
so near her heart might fairly have entitled her to 
more considerate and more kindly treatment than 
she has received from some quarters. We do not 
believe, from all we know of this case, that the 



8

principle of freedom in teaching is in any serious 
danger at Stanford University. It certainly could 
not suffer at the hands of President Jordan, who 
was sufficiently well known both for character and 
scholarship before he went out to make Stanford 
University one of the greatest civilizing influences, 
and himself one of the greatest individual forces 
for good, on the Pacific Coast. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



POE AND THE HALL OF FAME. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The list of the first twenty-nine immortals chosen 
for the " Hall of Fame for Great Americans," inaugu- 
rated by the New York University, does not include 
the name of Edgar Allan Poe. This time, who hath 
done it ? 

A body of one hundred electors, composed of twenty- 
five university or college presidents, twenty-six profes- 
sors of history and scientists, twenty-six editors and 
authors and publicists, and twenty-three supreme court 
judges, State and National " representing the wisdom 
of the American people," these are the jurymen who 
have failed to find a place for Poe in an American 
Hall of Fame. 

Literary England, and particularly Mr. Edmund W. 
Gosse, would doubtless question that " wisdom " which 
shows itself in undervaluing Art. Mr. Gosse regards 
Poe as our most perfect, most original, and most 
exquisite poet, and says that were he an American Ire 
would consider the nation's failure to appreciate him 
extraordinary, sinister, and disastrous. 

THE DIAL'S symposium on " The American Rejec- 
tion of Poe," a year or two ago, brought out many 
warm defenders of the poet, one of whom wrote : " Poe, 
in my judgment, was the greatest intellect America 
has produced assuredly the best artist. His tales 
seem to me the third collection in point of merit in 
literature the other two being the Arabian Nights 
and Boccaccio." And another: " Of all the American 
poets of the day, Poe alone fades not. The rest have 
lost color. They worked in daguerreotype; he painted 
in oil." And still another: " One great good thing in 
a poet like Poe is that he shows what art for art's sake 
can do. We in America need no incitement to value 
literature for its practical worth. We do not need 
to be told that thought is important, for we know it. 
But we do need to be told that art, or style, is of 
value, for as a rule we are not so much on the lookout 
for that." 

Why are these defenders of the poet silent now in 
'the face of this fresh injustice to his memory ? 

In imagination, creative faculty, analysis, and origi- 
nality, Poe has but one rival in American literature. In 
musical poetry in the marvellous use he made of the 
power which the great god Pan blew into him " none 
sing so wildly well." To undervalue him because he 
left behind him no Emersonian rules of life and conduct 
because the glory of his matchless rhyme does not 
lie in " teaching men how to live well " is as absurd 
as it would be to undervalue Chopin because he did not 
write the Sonatas of Beethoven. 

As the " Hall of Fame " is a private enterprise, its 



final significance may perhaps be questioned; but as it 
is the only thing of its kind we have or may for some 
time have in America, its meaning to the American 
people will grow in importance with the years, and it 
is as well to treat it seriously. 

Resolution Six of the rules adopted by the Univer- 
sity Senate relating to the nomination of candidates 
states that " Any nomination by any citizen of the 
United States that shall be addressed to the New 
York University Senate' shall be received and con- 
sidered by that body." 

Why should not all lovers of Poe avail themselves of 
the opportunity therein afforded to place his name in 

nomination ? ...

A DISCREDITED MUSEUM OF ETRUSCAN 

ARCHEOLOGY. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

A recent pamphlet by a young Italian excavator, 
Sig. Fausto Benedetti, treats of matters which, though 
of immediate importance to only a small group of 
specialists in Etruscan archaeology, are indirectly of 
interest to a much wider public. For they affect the 
scientific standing and the official honor of Comm. 
Barnabei, who was lately Director of Antiquities and 
Fine Arts for the kingdom of Italy, and is reported to 
be seeking reinstatement in the same position; and no 
cultivated visitor to Italy, no friend anywhere of Italian 
art and antiquities, can afford to be indifferent to the 
manner in which that office is administered. 

In 1888 a museum was established in the Villa 
Ginlia, situated a half mile or so outside the Porta del 
Popolo, and this museum has been stocked chiefly with 
objects found in the territory of the ancient Falerii, 
the necropolis of Narce having furnished a large share 
of the material. This material is professedly arranged 
according to tombs, the contents of each tomb by 
themselves; and this separation is all-important for 
scientific purposes, inasmuch as the tombs belong to 
different epochs of Etruscan civilization. The objects 
from Narce have been elaborately described and dis- 
cussed in Volume IV. of the " Monumenti Antichi," 
the sumptuous archaeological periodical issued by the 
Accademia dei Lincei. So far as appearances went, the 
arrangement in the museum and the publication in the 
" Monumenti Antichi " were controlled by a scientific 
rigor worthy of all praise. But disquieting charges in 
regard to this point have for some time been current; 
and now, on the heels of a whitewashing report made 
by a governmental commission, there comes a convincing 
attack from the hand of Sig. Benedetti, who conducted 
the excavations at Narce as a private enterprise of his 
father's and his own. The title of his pamphlet is 
" Gli Scavi di Narce ed il Museo di Villa Ginlia " 
[The Excavations at Narce and the Villa Ginlia 
Museum]; and it is published in Turin by Loescher, 
and in London by Mr. David Nutt. 

The author was only fifteen years old when, in 1889, 
he began his work at Narce. He has presumably had 
but little education, and the wonder is that he writes 
as well as he does. He tells his story calmly, with 
every appearance of frankness and with full recognition 
of his own limitations. Moreover, he quotes extensively 
from documentary evidence which it is impossible to 
regard as falsified. So far as the present reviewer 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



can make ont from the evidence before him, Sig. Ben- 
edetti completely establishes his case. 

It appears that the museum in the Villa Ginlia has 
been managed with the grossest laxity and falsity. No 
pains were taken to secure adequate records of the 
excavations, and such information as the young exca- 
vator was able to supply was disregarded and his 
memoranda were actually destroyed. The plans of the 
various cemeteries and of the individual tombs pub- 
lished in the " Monumenti Antichi " are inaccurate or 
wholly imaginary, and the contents of the various 
tombs have been hopelessly confused. With good 
reason may Sig. Benedetti write (page 44): "My 
labor has been lost, and the loss can never be recov- 
ered." 

It is a deplorable story, but it is better that the 
truth should be known. If the injury done is beyond 
repair, at least it is to be hoped that the present 
Minister of Public Instruction in Italy and his suc- 
cessors may see to it that no such scandal in the De- 
partment of Antiquities and Fine Arts shall again be 
possible. F. B. TARBELL.

READING SHAKESPEARE AS A DUTY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Apropos of Mr. Anderson's remarks, in the last issue 
of THE DIAL, on my expression, " We read Shakespeare 
as a duty," in the previous number, I may be permitted 
to explain that " we " does not implicate my critic nor 
others. However, I suspect that most educated people, 
if they were frank to confess, would acknowledge that 
while they enjoy Shakespeare's dramas as acted the 
true test of the drama they do not find them special 
favorites as read. Though Shakespeare is said by many 
critics to be equally adapted to the stage and the closet, 
yet, as a matter of fact, he is rarely read save per- 
functorily by college instructors and classes and by 
some precieuses. In short we are growing beyond the 
Shakespeare idolatry period, just as we are growing 
beyond the period of the idolatry of the Grseco- Roman 
classics. Like Milton and the Bible, Shakespeare lies 
unopened in most cultivated homes from one year's end 
to another, at least as far as spontaneous pleasurable 
reading goes. If an honest census were made of those 
who, daily, weekly, or even monthly, turn to the read- 
ing of Shakespeare " with delight," their number would 
be found to be amazingly small. For those few, how- 
ever, I have admiration and even envy; but I am un- 
willing to admit them as the sole representatives of the 
children of light, and the saving remnant from Philis- 
tinism in this generation. HlRAM M STANLEY.

EARLY this year will be published Prof. A. Campbell 
Fraser's new edition, in four volumes, of the Complete 
Woris of Bishop Berkeley, all arranged in chrono- 
logical order. Professor Fraser has thoroughly revised 
and recast his previous edition of the Works, published 
in three octavo volumes at the Clarendon Press in 1871, 
and now out of print. The Introductions and Notes 
have been practically re-written; and a brief new 
biography will be prefixed. All fresh materials that 
have come to light within the last thirty years have been 
incorporated throughout ; and this may be regarded as 
the final Oxford edition of the great Irish Philosopher.

LETTER-WRITER AXD POET.* 

Now and then there crops up in print a new 
collection of letters, like Fitzgerald's or Smeth- 
am's or Stevenson's, good enough to set review- 
ers of the sanguine sort to hailing cheerfully a 
revival of the long-mourned-as-lost art of letter- 
writing. Such is the case with the two trim 
volumes now before us, the Letters of Thomas 
Edward Brown ; and it should be said, and 
noted as a favorable sign, that the marked stir 
of interest caused by them is the result of the 
intrinsic and generally unlooked-for merit of 
the letters themselves, and not of the celebrity 
of the writer, Brown's public, even in his 
own country, not having been a large one. 

An author of no wide vogue at home, Brown 
has been, we think, even less known in Amer- 
ica : and hence a word or so about him now, 
a statement of the main facts in his not very 
eventful career, prefatory to the foretaste we 
propose giving through quotation of his cer- 
tainly remarkable letters, may not come amiss. 
He was born in the Isle of Man in 1830, and 
died in 1897. His father, the Rev. Robert 
Brown, Vicar of Kirk Braddan, near Douglas, 
was a writer and preacher of something more 
than local repute a sort of Grandison of the 
pen (as we gather from the notice of him by 
the editor of the Letters), who was so nice in 
his notions of literary deportment that he used 
to " make his son read to him some fragment 
of an English classic before answering an in- 
vitation." At fifteen Brown went to King 
William's College, where he distinguished him- 
self in verse composition, Greek, Latin, and 
English, and developed that distaste for math- 
ematics so often coupled with the literary gift. 
An old schoolfellow, Archdeacon Wilson, 
thus speaks of him : 

" I can well remember, as a small boy of eleven, just 
placed in the fifth class at King William's College, 
having Brown pointed ont to me, not without awe. He 
was said to ' know more than any master! ' and to have 
written the best Latin prose that the University exam- 
iners had ever seen! ' . . . Of course he never saw or 
spoke to a youngster like me." 

The " of course " can only be appreciated by 
those who know from some experience what

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



the " head boy " of an English school is to his 
cringing and reverential juniors, who are only 
too glad to blacken his boots, and fetch and 
carry for him like so many spaniels. The drop 
from this high estate of " head boy " to the 
quasi-menial one of a servitorship at Christ 
Church, Oxford, whither he went in 1849, was 
a trying one for Brown, as is bitterly indicated 
in an article on the position of a servitor at 
Oxford in his time, which he wrote years after 
for " Macmillan's Magazine." But to Oxford 
he went, and his academical career there is 
described as a peculiarly brilliant one. He not 
only won a double First Class in 1853, but 
found himself, in 1854, " in the proud position 
of a Fellow of Oriel " as Dr. Fowler records 
with academic unction. 

The life of an Oxford Fellow was not, how- 
ever, one to Brown's liking. He had no wish, 
he said, to " fatten on a Fellowship," nor did 
a Tutorship attract him ; so after a few terms 
with private pupils he returned to the Isle of 
Man, and became Vice-Principal of King 
William's College. Then he went to the Crypt 
School, at Gloucester, where his friend Mr. 
W. E. Henley was his pupil. After a brief 
stay at Gloucester he was asked to take the 
Modern Side at Clifton College, Bristol ; and 
there he remained as a master for thirty-six 
years, leading a life outwardly uneventful but 
intellectually rich, and productive of work of 
which the world has taken too little notice. All 
his published poems were written, and most of 
them were published, while he was at Clifton 
" Betsy Lee," in 1873 ; Fo'c's'le Yarns " 
(including "Betsy Lee"), in .1881, and in 
1889; "The Doctor and Other Poems," in 
1887 ; " The Manx Witch and Other Poems," 
in 1889 ; and " Old John and Other Poems," 
in 1893. These works have now been gathered 
into a rather thick volume of Collected Poems, 
which comes to us almost simultaneously with 
the Letters. 

A former pupil at Clifton, Mr. H. F. Brown 
(the author, if we remember rightly, of an ad- 
mirable book on Venice), writes as follows of 
the impression he retained of his old master's 
strong and somewhat rugged personality : 

" He never spoke to me out of school, and I never 
knew him at all privately or socially at that time, but 
his personality made a great impression ; his slow sort 
of urgent walk, like Leviathan, his thick massive figure, 
above all his voice. I used to see him in the distance on 
his lonely strolls about the downs, and his figure seemed 
to belong to and to explain the downs, the river, the 
woods, the Severn, and the far Welsh hills. I remem- 
ber him walking in the rain, and looking as if he liked 



it, as I did. Personally, at that time I was afraid of 
him; but he stirred fancy, curiosity, imagination. I 
should say that his educational function lay in ' widen- 
ing.' He was a ' widener.' He made one feel that 
there was something beyond the school, beyond success- 
ful performances at lessons or at games; there was a 
whiff of the great world brought iu by him." 

Brown's letters, as selected for publication 
by Mr. Sidney T. Irwin, the editor of these 
volumes and long a colleague of Brown's at 
Clifton, extend chronologically from 1851, or 
the period of the author's undergraduateship, 
to 1897, the year of his death. Whatever 
faults may have been ascribed to Brown in his- 
lifetime, no one ever thought of calling him 
commonplace. His mind was one of quite un- 
usual turn and content ; and he gave it free- 
rein in his letters. He liked, as he said, " to- 
please his friends "; and when he took pen in 
hand to write to a friend he poured out with- 
out stint the best he could say or fancy of the 
topic in hand. He did not " keep his best for 
the printer," for he was singularly indifferent 
to general recognition, and had no need of 
slaving for that difficult and fickle taskmaster 
and patron, the public. The not too wide circle 
of his chosen friends was the public he served 
by choice, and the one whose approval he valued 
most. His love of nature was profound, and 
sought frequent expression in word-paintings^ 
a little rhapsodic at times, but often of marked 
power and beauty, as in the following picture 
of the Jungfrau : 

" So the Jungfrau vis-a-vis-es you frankly through 
the bright sweet intervening air. . . . One evening our 
sunset was the real rose-pink you have heard of so 
much. It fades, you know, into a death-like chalk- 
white. That is the most awful thing. A sort of spasm 
seems to come over her face, and in an instant she is a 
corpse, rigid, and oh so cold! Well, so she died, and 
you felt as if a great soul had ebbed away into the 
Heaven of Heavens: and thankful, but very sad, I went 
up to nay room. I was reading by candle-light, for it 
gets dark immediately after sunset, when A. shrieked 
to me to come to the window. What a Resurrection 
so gentle, so tender like that sonnet of Milton's about 
his dead wife returning in a vision! The moon had 
risen; and there was the Jungfrau oh, chaste, oh, 
blessed saint in glory everlasting! Then all the ele- 
mental spirits that haunt crevasses, and hover around 
peaks, all the patient powers that bear up the rocky 
buttresses, and labor to sustain great slopes, all streams,, 
and drifts, and flowers, and vapors, made a symphony, 
a time most solemn and rapturous. ... A young Swiss 
felt it, and with exquisite delicacy feeling his way, as. 
it were, to some expression, however inadequate, he 
played a sonata of Schumann, and one or two of the 
songs, such as the Friihlingsnacht." 

That Brown had in a high degree the artist's 
love of expression for its own sake is more 
evident in the following characteristic notelet :

" Last night I had a ramble which it would be hard 
to describe. I went round aud round something ; 
probably myself. One point there was upon the cir- 
cumference a spark a ship working her way up 
channel against wind and tide. The ship was invisible 
in the gloom, but the light what intense yearning ! 
and what pluck and energy too ! It was like a red 
diamond, if there be such a thing, boring into black- 
ness. I could almost hear the rip-rip of the severing 
sheets of darkness; or perhaps, rather, a delicate hum 
of the gritty grating stuff through which she had to 
pass. But no, I return to the first idea. The borer, 
the red diamond piercing the black marble." 

To many readers not of the now ruling 
generation the following note (1881) on Car- 
lyle's death will be gratefully intelligible : 

" And True Thomas ' is gone. What has he not 
been to men of my generation ? And the younger men 
come and ask one What was it? What did he teach ? 
and so forth ; and, of course, there is nothing to be said 
in that direction. And, if one mumbles something be- 
tween one's teeth (impatiently, rather like a half- 
chewed curse) something about a Baptism of fire 
my graceful adolescents look shocked, and, for the 
most part, repeat the question, ' Yes, yes, but what did 
he teach? ' To which (I mean when repeated) there is 
no possible reply, but the honest outspoken ' 1) .' " 

The note on Carlyle naturally leads up to 
the following amusing dissertation on genius, 
evidently in reply to a friend's plaint of a par- 
ticular instance of the proverbial seamy side 
of the man of genius. 

"A genius! that's it. And they are all like that, 
almost all. Those little falsetti, and affectations, and 
posings, and putting the best foot foremost; those 
cravings for appreciation, the egotism, the self-con- 
sciousness (go ahead!), all characterize the genius. You 
must take him with them take him or leave him 
alone. But you seem to seek a portent! a man of 
genius and a man of hard practical common-sense 
knocked into one. The world has produced half a 
dozen such men. They are tremendous. But 
Heaven help us! you must be content with some- 
thing less than this, or Nature will never get her men 
off her hands. ' Sell me a genius,' say you. Here 
.you are,' says Nature, handing over a lot, ' plenty of 
choice : marked in figures ; read Byron, Shelley, 
Keats, Coleridge ' ' Oh, I want ' Well, what do 
jou want? ' ' A strong, powerful, healthy intellect, and 
genius as a dooragh.' * ' Oh, thank you for nothing! 
We don't make them. You had better try the shop 
over the way, or give a special order, and we can try, 
provided you are willing to wait a thousand years or 
o!' . . . This 'rift within the lute' of genius is the 
inseparable accident ... I have no doubt that to 
many of us it were better if we never got to know men 
of genius privately. You may depend upon it that, 
throughout the history of literature, they offended their 
contemporaries by their airs and their bosh, their petti- 
uess aud their asinine conceit. Never mind! The world 
has taken its hat off to these men, and so must we. 
We need not stroke the quills on the ' back of the 
fretful porpeutine '; let us avoid coming into too close 
contact. Perhaps some of them had better be kept in

cages. But chance may domesticate you with one; 
you may, for instance, marry one. Poor Mrs. Carlyle! " 

On the following somewhat satirical passage 
from a letter of 1895, comment were superfluous. 

" Have you seen Mat. Arnold's Letters * I hear of 
a Penny Mat. Arnold published by Stead ( / / ). Is that 
possible? And to be followed by a Penny Clough ! 
Did yon ever ? Is he publishing them in penny num- 
bers ? the whole to cost a lot ? Or, positively, can we 

have Mat. the whole nnmntilated Mat for a 

penny ? And by Stead f Wonders will never cease. 
Fancy Mat., from that fair heaven which now holds his 
dainty ghost, stooping to sniff, etc. . . . Still, one has 
the consolation of thinking that he must be amused 
when he beholds waving a censor in his temple such a 
high-priest as Stead amused yes, and note the 
shrinking nostril, how it curves! " 

The foregoing quotations should suffice to 
show the general tone and the genre of Brown's 
letters, and to establish the point, at least, that 
commonness is the last quality to be predicated 
of them. Their diversity, their rich allusive- 
ness, their swift spontaneity, their protean 
mutability of mood, their odd humor, we have 
but faintly indicated. All in all, they seem to 
us to form one of the richest and most original 
collections of the kind of recent years. Mr. 
Irwin has done his editing well and helpfully, 
in the main ; but for some inscrutable reason 
the volumes were issued without an Index, 
which they especially need. This omission we 
trust to see supplied in the forthcoming second 
edition of the Letters, already called for. The 
volumes are well printed, though not without 
an occasional slip in the spelling, for in- 
stance, " Olnet " for Ohnet, on page 220, and 
" Cuddie " for Caddy, on page 208. 

The popularity of Brown's letters will doubt- 
less send people to reading, or re-reading, his 
poems ; and hence the convenient volume of 
" Collected Poems of T. E. Brown " recently 
issued by the Messrs. Macmillan comes with 
especial timeliness. The not very poetic Manx 
dialect with which not a few of these earnest 
but somewhat rugged productions are plenti- 
fully sprinkled may prove an obstacle to some 
readers ; and we should think that a taste for 
Brown's poetry must in general be something 
of an acquired one. But once acquired it will 
be likely to abide, and to prove a source of no 
small joy and profit of the high sort that genuine 
poetry alone, with a strain of broad human 
sympathy in it, can give. The volume contains 
736 compact pages, and is the latest number 
of its publishers' admirable series of Uniform 
Editions of the Poets, including such masters 
as Tennyson and Browning. A fine portrait of 
the author forms the frontispiece. E. G. J.

CHRISTIANITY IN AMERICA BEFORE 
COLUMBUS.* 



In these days of easy authorship and half- 
matured production, it is a strengthening of 
faith in the survival of learning to take up two 
large volumes that show research and investi- 
gation requiring many years of patient labor. 
To attempt even a cursory examination of the 
multitude of myths and legends on the rela- 
tions between the Old and the New worlds 
prior to Columbus is a task that might dissuade 
any save a scholar who works under the in- 
centive of religious zeal and writes from a fixed 
purpose. Fifteen pages of closely-printed 
bibliography reveal a searching investigation 
that extends backward from the " moneron " 
of Darwin to the voyages of Columbus. In 
addition to the printed authorities, two pages 
of manuscripts and archives, mostly in the 
Vatican, are included. The Bible, Humboldt's 
JExamen Critique, and Herrera's Historia 
General are most frequently cited. Such an 
exhaustive list of authorities on the relations 
between the two hemispheres prior to Columbus 
is rarely met with. 

Rejecting, on religious grounds, the theory 
of evolution, which he terms " the fashionable 
school of science sprung up during the latter 
half of our century," as also the suggestion 
that the American aborigines were pre- Adam- 
ites, the author proceeds to examine the Cave 
Dwellers and the Mound Builders as types of 
people separate from the Indians of Columbus, 
and possessing a higher civilization, whose 
origin must be accounted for. Such advanced 
state is also indicated by ruins in Central 
America, California, Peru, and Brazil. Simi- 
larity between the traditions of the aborigines 
and the descriptions of the Old Testament 
forms further proof of a pre-Christian civili- 
zation. As a means of crossing the waters, 
the author seems to accept Plato's Atlantis, as 
nearly as he expresses a definite opinion on 
any point raised. Seeking the peoples by whom 
this civilization was brought from the Old 
world to the New, he rejects the Phoenicians, 
Jews, pre-Christian Irish, Romans, and Afri- 
cans, and, by the law of elimination, is " in- 
clined to believe " that these traditions were 
" brought into America by the nearest descen- 
dants of the patriarch Noe, who had taken 
their course in an easterly direction, landing

in America, either at Behring Strait, or, after 
sailing through Polynesia, on the western 
coast of Central America and Peru." Accord- 
ing to this hypothesis, Christianity becomes 
America's " second civilizer." 

Finding here his real thesis, the author an- 
nounces the apostle St. Thomas as the agent 
who brought Christianity to early America, 
although that St. James or St. Paul came is 
not " an unreasonable induction." Anticipating 
the objection that human agencies were wanting 
in those days for such journeys, the writer 
takes refuge in the superhuman or the miracu- 
lous. " Is not the whole establishment of 
Christianity one single great miracle too little 
noticed ? " Discussion of this point resolves 
itself into the old controversy between the 
Spanish church which claimed the credit for 
the evangelization of America, and the other 
Roman Catholic nations which objected to such 
a monopoly. 

An examination of the rites of the western 
savages further strengthens the hypothesis of 
a pre-Columbian Christianity. Crude forms 
of the confessional are found, as well as baptism, 
the eucharist, convents, monasteries, and celi- 
bates. Penance is not uncommon ; but when 
penance becomes self-torture, it ceases to be a 
church function, according to the author, and 
becomes one of " Satan's rites." Numerous 
witnesses are found to testify to the finding of 
the crucifix among so-called heathen emblems j 
of the representation of a man fastened to a 
cross ; of the expectation of a Messiah, and 
even his birth from a virgin. 

The people of Ireland seem the most likely 
agents who disseminated this knowledge of the 
church in America. That no trace of them 
remains is due to their relapsing into barbar- 
ism. Traditions of the Welsh in America, 
the delightful crux of our scientific ancestors, 
are explained by a similar appearance and 
disappearance of that people. The claims of 
the Scandinavians are examined through the 
sagas, indubitable evidences of them being 
found all along the Atlantic coast from New 
York to New Foundland. Between these 
Norsemen and Columbus, the author finds a 
host of daring men who crossed the " great 
Sea of Darkness," thus enabling him to pro- 
claim with evident satisfaction his summing; 
up, that " knowledge and not genius directed 
the voyages of Columbus." 

Beginning by chance his inquiries among 
the archives of the Vatican, the author could 
not avoid a pardonable pride in the early

13 



achievements of his church and a resulting ten- 
dency to favor her claims. Of this fact he is 
confessedly conscious in his introduction. He 
has " kept a steady eye on the religious par- 
ticulars "; he admits the " religious trend " of 
his work ; but at the same time he has made 
it his " duty to hear the testimony of dissent- 
ing and infidel authors." He apologizes for 
quoting so frequently H. H. Bancroft and 
W. H. Prescott, " two authors whose religious 
ideas are either extremely vague or absolutely 
null when not inimical to Christianity." 

Quite naturally the author's conclusions on 
a majority of the questions concerning primi- 
tive days are based upon the Scriptures. For 
instance, after examining the opinions of a 
multitude of scientists as to the probable time 
of the appearance of man on the earth, and 
summing up their widely divergent opinions, 
the author refuses to steer his "exploration 
bark " by their figures, and decides " for pru- 
dence to seek safety in the harbor opened to 
us by that venerable book," etc. Similar dis- 
crepancies existing among Bible students upon 
this point he easily disposes of by the state- 
ment that if we knew more about the Scrip- 
tures we could the better explain them. 

Aside from the criticism that the work is 
more of a Middle Age church disquisition than 
a modern historical essay, one must note the 
difficulty that always attends such obsolete 
methods the impossibility of rendering by 
them a verdict upon any mooted question. 
The mind is lost in uncertainty between the 
legendary and the authentic. Only when 
resting upon Scriptural ground does the 
author venture beyond the highly probable. 
In general, he rarely states a fixed opinion. 
Thus, of the texts of the Scriptures he finds 
that " which one is right and which wrong will 
most likely ever remain a matter of dispute "; 
the time and circumstances of the disappear- 
ance of the so-called Mound Builders are 
" involved in as deep mystery as those of their 
first appearance "; while concerning the sup- 
posed evidences of the Norsemen in Massachu- 
setts, "explanation strictly historical is now 
impossible." 

On the other hand, it should be said that no 
previous work has disclosed to the general 
reader so many disquisitions on the possible 
Christianization of the Western world before 
Columbus, nor made so full a compilation of 
the many opinions on this vexed question. The 
volumes will be read with interest even by 
those who lament that the author did not con- 



fine himself to a narrower field and a less 
pre- judged attitude. Mention should be made 
of the several charts accompanying the descrip- 
tive matter. In closing, the author announces 
a similar work upon the spread of Christianity 
in America after Columbus.

Two BOOKS ox BANKING.* 

The compiler of a history of banking in the 
United States is confronted at the outset by a 
difficulty inherent in the material with which 
he has to deal. Should the treatment be chro- 
nological? or should the subject-matter be 
divided into histories of banking in each of 
the States, with a separate section for banks 
chartered by the Federal government ? The 
latter plan is the one followed by Mr. Knox 
in the work before us. This plan facilitates 
the tabulation and orderly arrangement of the 
vast array of details which defy all attempts 
at condensation ; but on the other hand it 
makes the coordination of the material a prac- 
tical impossibility and precludes the compre- 
hensive view that is essential to complete 
understanding. The aim of the author was to 
gather all the information possible " upon 
every phase of banking in every State of the 
Union." This work, left unfinished at his 
death in 1892, has now been revised and 
brought up to date under the editorship of 
Mr. Bradford Rhodes and Mr. Youngman of 
the " Bankers' Magazine," with the assistance 
of " a corps of financial writers " who have 
furnished sketches of banking history in the 
several States. The result is a stout octavo 
volume of eight hundred and eighty closely 
printed pages, which, although it contains 
much information not elsewhere accessible, is 
not so much a connected history as a collection 
of material for one. To a certain extent the 
book has the advantage of being the work of 
a banker of training and ripe experience, who 
had, moreover, during his long service as 
Comptroller of the Currency, exceptional op- 
portunities for familiarizing himself with the 
varied details of his subject ; nevertheless, it

is on the whole disappointing. The desire of 
the editors (it is impossible to determine the 
extent of Mr. Knox's authorship) to chronicle 
the facts without bias may be assumed to be 
the reason why all statement of basic princi- 
ples and explanation of events by reference 
thereto is, as far as may be, omitted. This is 
somewhat like the play of " Hamlet " with 
Hamlet left out. 

Strange as it may seem, the principles of 
sound banking have never been well under- 
stood in the United States, even by bankers 
themselves. As a consequence there has been 
nothing in the nature of progressive develop- 
ment with gradual addition of desirable fea- 
tures and elimination of defective ones. 
Instead, we have but a sorry record of the 
practical trial of almost every conceivable 
theory in regard to banking and credit. No 
other country has been the field for such a 
variety of foolish legislation upon the subject. 
Good banking systems in some of the States 
and bad systems in other States have existed 
side by side, yet seemingly with little or no 
comprehension, on the part of bankers, legisla- 
tors, or the public generally, of what consti- 
tuted the vital difference between them. At no 
time has a thoroughly sound, well-considered, 
and comprehensive system, adapted in all 
respects to the needs of the country, been in 
operation. The National Banking Law brought 
order out of the chaos which preceded its en- 
actment, and has many excellent features, yet 
it is far from creating an ideal system. Its 
very success in protecting the note-holder from 
loss is responsible for the prevalence of erro- 
neous ideas in regard to the true character of 
the note-issuing function. This function has 
always been one of the chief stumbling-blocks 
in the way of an understanding of banking 
principles. Ignorance of these principles led 
to the enactment of laws in some of the States, 
of which unscrupulous men were quick to take 
advantage, and " wildcat banks " and " stump- 
tail currency " were the logical sequence. 
Even in the States in which the note issues 
were on a sound basis, the volume in circula- 
tion was regulated more by accident as, for 
example in New England, through the develop- 
ment of the Suffolk Bank redemption system 
than as the result of a clear conception of the 
governing principle. This principle, stated 
briefly, is that no bank should pay out over its 
counter other bank notes than its own, and 
that provision should be made for daily 
redemption in all the commercial centres. In 



this way only can true " elasticity " be secured 
and the volume of the currency be automatic- 
ally adjusted to the needs of the community. 

In a book more than half of which is made 
up of articles by some twenty-seven different 
authors, consistent exposition in the light of 
any one view of what is the true explanation 
of the occurrences described, is not to be ex- 
pected ; and it is not surprising, therefore, to 
find effects attributed to entirely different 
causes, as on page 458, where one author 
thinks the panic of 1857 was due to the low 
tariff then in force ; while another writer, on 
page 512, expresses the opinion that inflation 
of the currency was the cause. Such differ- 
ences of opinion are perhaps inevitable in a 
work by so many hands. The editors, how- 
ever, must be held responsible for not elimi- 
nating, so far as possible, the jargon of " the 
street " and adopting a scientific terminology 
in its place. To speak of " money," when 
" free loanable capital " is the correct phrase, 
may be sufficiently intelligible to the man who 
borrows or the banker who lends the capital ; 
but the use of such language in a history is in 
the highest degree misleading. What wonder 
is it that when people are informed that 
" money is scarce " they should jump to the 
conclusion that the volume of the circulating 
medium is inadequate ? Yet the simple truth 
is that it is not money but loanable capital 
that has become scarce, because the free cap- 
ital of the country or the locality which free 
capital may consist either of money or credit 
is in use owing to increased business activity, 
or is locked up through apprehension on the 
part of its owners. It is true that money and 
capital and credit are, under some circum- 
stances, interchangeable terms ; but that need 
not here be taken into consideration, this not 
being the place for extended discussion of the 
relation between them. 

Comment in detail upon the many topics 
treated in this volume would expand these 
remarks far beyond the limits of available 
space. As a storehouse of information, it is a 
welcome addition to banking literature. Many 
of the separate articles are ably written and 
are worthy of separate reviews. Much pains 
appears to have been taken to secure accuracy 
of statement. While there are occasional 
slips as, for instance, on page 192, where it 
is a little surprising to read that the Metro- 
politan National Bank of Chicago failed in the 
year 1888, such mistakes are remarkably 
few for a work of such magnitude.

THE DIAL,

The utility of the Clearing House as a labor- 
saving and time-saving device in banking is 
well understood. Curiously enough, 



now 



although the idea of offsetting mutual demands 
against each other and settling them by pay- 
ment of the resulting balances only, is sim- 
plicity itself, the methods by which it is put 
into practice vary widely. Mr. Cannon has 
performed a service which bankers will appre- 
ciate, in setting forth in detail, in his book on 
44 Clearing Houses," the machinery in use for 
this purpose in the different cities in the United 
States, and also in London, in Canada, and in 
Japan. The work is that of a banker thor- 
oughly familiar with his subject and careful 
in his presentment of it. 

Clearing Houses in their inception were the 
outgrowth of a practical necessity. The same 
consideration has led most of these institutions 
in the United States to assume functions other 
than the primary one for which they were 
established. Many have become to a greater 
or less degree a medium for united action on 
the part of their members. Rales regulating 
collection charges, rates of interest on deposits, 
banking hours, and other matters, have been 
adopted in many cities. The most important 
of the added functions is the pooling of 
resources in times of financial stress through 
the issue of Clearing House loan certificates. 
This contrivance, the most ingenious which 
has been evolved from the banking methods in 
vogue in the United States, affording as it 
does a partial remedy for the lack of elasticity 
in our currency, is discussed at length by Mr. 
Cannon. While pointing out the great benefit 
which has accrued from the resort to such cer- 
tificates in critical times, he omits to indicate 
the disadvantage which their use implies. 
There can be no doubt that the issue of loan 
certificates by the New York banks in 1893 
relieved the acuteness of the distress then 
prevalent ; but it is true also that it intensified 
the currency famine and subjected bankers 
and merchants throughout the country to a 
heavy tax by causing an abnormally large dis- 
count on New York exchange. Alone among 
banks in the leading commercial centres, the 
Chicago banks have never made use of this 
device. There are many reasons for this ; 
among them, the certainty of inducing a 
scarcity of currency, which could not fail to 
bear with severity upon the great market-place 
for products always bought and sold for cash, 
has ever been a potent consideration. 

Mr. Cannon very justly criticises the custom 



which obtains among the Boston banks of 
lending to each other the credit balances aris- 
ing from the clearing. In commenting upon a 
somewhat similar practice in Chicago, he does 
not appear to note the important distinction 
that the Chicago banks trade their balances 
merely as a matter of convenience and to avoid 
the risk of carrying large sums of money 
through the streets. The necessity of being 
always prepared to make cash settlements is 
not in the least done away with. Such settle- 
ments are liable to be insisted upon at any 
time, and especially in periods of stringency. 
FREDERICK "W. GOOKIN. 



A FRESH 



In some glowing words concerning his coun- 
try, an American poet sings : 

" Here the last stand is made. 
If we fail here, what new Columbus bold, 

Steering 1 brave prow through black seas unafraid, 
Finds oat a fresh land where man may abide 

And freedom yet be saved ? " 

And the answer comes with no uncertain voice 
in the new book by Mr. Henry Demarest 
Lloyd, an amplification of his recent "Country 
without Strikes," and entitled, ' Newest En- 
gland, Notes of a Democratic Traveller in New 
Zealand, with Some Australian Comparisons." 
To those unfamiliar with the practical accom- 
plishments of the statesmen guiding the desti- 
nies of the English-speaking people in the 
antipodes, the book will be a surprise ; to all 
idealists and believers in human perfectibility 
it will be a delight ; and to evolutionists gen- 
erally it will be in a sense a stumbling-block. 
At the same time it is reasonable proof that 
many things we in the United States have been 
dismissing as Utopian dreams are eminently 
practical in unselfish hands, requiring nothing 
more abstract than leaders of the people who 
have the welfare of the people first at heart, 
with intelligence enough to know where that 
welfare lies. 

In 1890 the people of Australasia found the 
world slipping beneath their feet. A huge 
strike, extending through the Australian con- 
tinent and its tributary islands, had been com- 
pletely overthrown and the labor element left 
gasping with defeat. Concurrently, financial 
dishonesty and monetary stringency had par- 
alyzed capital, so that in victory it was no

happier than its opponent in rout. In this 
emergency, as Mr. Lloyd tells us, there arose 
in New Zealand a small body of men, themselves 
the sons of the people, but sons who had not 
forgotten their upbringing, who stepped into 
the gap. The Bank of New Zealand, whining 
patriotism while it plundered rich and poor 
alike, was taken out of a slough of despond 
into which its managers had plunged it, and 
the country was thereby enabled to weather 
the financial storms which all but wrecked the 
sister colonies. This accomplished, a series 
of reforms was set on foot, the end of which 
is not yet. It is with these that Mr. Lloyd is 
chiefly concerned, and they are already so 
numerous that little more than a summary of 
them can be given. 

First of all, the New Zealand government, 
recognizing tramps, paupers, and workless 
laborers as symptoms of a disease infecting the 
body politic, was wise enough to regard it as 
only one of several symptoms, among which 
were also to be counted millionaires when made 
by turning over to private individuals any of 
the powers of government for the sake of 
private gain. The system of taxation was 
therefore reversed. The tax which bore most 
heavily on the improvements of land, and so 
on enterprise and thrift, was taken off, and 
the burden thrown on vacant land. If the 
holdings were large, the tax was proportion- 
ately larger ; if owned by an absentee, larger 
still ; and the right to purchase any given 
estate at a ten per centum advance on the 
valuation given in for purposes of taxation 
was legalized a measure which has given 
relief to scores of New Zealand families by 
enabling them to leave the overcrowded cities. 
Leases in perpetuity, with occupancy as an 
essential, make it impossible for the land to 
return again into the hands of the few. " No 
man now dreams," an eminent New Zealander 
is quoted as saying, " of founding a great 
landed estate in New Zealand." 

In the public works, beginning with road- 
making and extending thence to bridge-build- 
ing and even to the erection of public edifices, 
it has been found possible by the rulers of 
these islands to dispense altogether with the 
services of the middleman, to give the work 
directly to the workmen, and to give it in such 
a way that the weaker and less efficient among 
the workmen are fully secured in their chances 
of earning such a living as they are capable of 
earning. 

Recognizing that in trades unions the only 



efficient ally of the State against the greed of 
employers is to be found, the one bulwark 
against the wholesale manufacture of men of 
broken wills and hopeless futures, the govern- 
ment set about restraining the power of both 
employers and employees for ill, passing a com- 
pulsory arbitration law which at a single move 
made strikes and the attendant abuses of public 
rights impossible, but limiting its beneficence 
to members of trades unions alone. A strike 
is not legally impossible in New Zealand, but 
a strike by organized labor the only form of 
strike which has proved effective is impos- 
sible. So a lockout by employers, singly or in 
combination, is not legally impossible, but may 
take place only when their employees have 
failed to join themselves to some labor organi- 
zation. It is significant that both sides not 
only welcome this innovation upon what some 
economists style natural rights, but refuse to 
avail themselves of the recommendation of the 
court below, the powers of which are limited to 
conciliation, and carry their cases to the point

resort ends the litigation by final adjudication. 

The railroads, prime cause of many great 
fortunes through partiality and private con- 
tract elsewhere, already belonged to the state 
in New Zealand, yet had been administered by 
a board remote from the popular will. The 
management was placed directly in the govern- 
ment, which is fully amenable to the will of 
the people as expressed at the polls. As a re- 
sult, the rates are fixed regardless of the wealth 
of the shipper or the value and quantities of 
his shipments, and the poor farmer and the 
rich manufacturer have exact equality in get- 
ting their wares to market. A single policy is 
declared that of cheaper rates. 

The government itself, without the interven- 
tion of a banker, advances money on lands for 
purposes of the improvement thereof, and the 
mortgage shark has disappeared with the rack 
renter. Not only this, but the government finds 
a market in London for the products of New 
Zealand industry, and advances money on con- 
signments, as of agricultural products, in its 
hands and inspected. The wild dream of the 
Western and Southern populist, which would 
have had the American government issue de- 
bentures based upon wheat and other grain in 
governmental warehouses to the farmer, is in 
New Zealand an accomplished fact.

week, the moneys for this purpose being secured 
by a progressive income tax. 

All these things have been " made to pay," 
as Mr. Lloyd is at pains to prove. Within 
the short time they have been operative they 
have been profitable to the country, and taxa- 
tion has decreased. It is not pretended that 
all abuses have been rectified. A highly pro- 
tective tariff still exists, for example ; but 
there is a perfect recognition on the part of 
the government that the effect of such a meas- 
ure is to enrich the rich and deplete the purses 
of the poor, and compensating taxation is ar- 
ranged for in view of that fact. 

Nor is the country standing still. The pro- 
gramme of the future contains such items as 
state fire insurance ; zone rates on railroads ; 
nationalized steamship lines, mines, and land ; 
in expensive law courts; state banking; and many 
more things of the sort, all of which seem 
to grow naturally out of existing conditions. 

As will be seen, the book is of the greatest 
interest to all students of existing social con- 
ditions. It is written in Mr. Lloyd's simplest 
and best manner, and is, within certain limits, 
convincing. Yet there is too little stress laid 
on the fact that only ten years have elapsed 
since the beginning of these reforms was made 
a mere second of time in sociology as in 
geology ; that the New Zealand statesman is 
as exceptional in training and ambitions as in 
achievements ; that " fraternalism," however 
different initially from " paternalism," still 
spells much the same thing ; and that the pro- 
posed Australasian confederation places an 
entirely new aspect on the whole case.

RECENT RELIGIOUS DISCUSSIONS.* 

The volume entitled " Evolution and Theology " 
is made up of a series of articles published at vari- 
ous times. It is vigorous, aggressive, and suggestive.

The author occasionally pushes bis view to a point 
that is self-destructive. Thus, he says : " If it is 
the methodic cardinal proposition of the science of 
to-day that we have to explain every condition as 
the causally determined development out of a pre- 
ceding one, this excludes the appearance of any 
condition, event, action, or personality, which is 
not explicable out of tbe factors of the preceding 
conditions and according to tbe laws of genesis 
in general" (page 9). This assertion leaves no 
standing-ground for human thought as a free, self- 
directed process. All mental activity sinks to a 
series of causal events, each series on the same foot- 
ing as every other series. The earth-worm leaves 
a shiny trail on the flag it traverses. The direction 
it pursues has no significance, has no rational 
basis. Tbe movement, at its highest and its lowest 
expression, is merely an obscure fact with no quality 
in the realm of truth. 

" The Religion of a Gentleman " the religion 
of a man is admirable in purpose and in execu- 
tion. Tbe author is possessed of strong spiritual 
susceptibilities, ruddy life, and quick intellect. His 
aim is to unite these human endowments in one 
coherent self-sustaining whole. The book will be 
helpful to all who are struggling for such a recon- 
ciliation, and find themselves embarrassed by ob- 
trusive irrational elements in religion. With sound 
common-sense, tbe author grasps at once tbe inner 
substance of faith. 

" Tbe Christian Conception of Holiness " is an 
effort to unite Christian doctrine and evolution in 
one harmonious conception. The intermediate 
thought by which this is done is " the gospel of 
creation," the development of a higher form of 
spiritual life. " God is a being whose every thought 
is love." " Creation is one great unselfish thought, 
the bringing into being of creatures who can know 
the happiness which God himself knows." The 
author has a vigorous hold upon his subject, and 
scatters light freely along the discussion. One who 
gladly accepts this general line of reconciliation 
will still be inclined to go farther, or less far, in the 
details of presentation, according to the degree in 
which he has worked out similar lines of inquiry. 
It is a bold region, full of various and captivating 
views. The manner of thought and expression is 
so isolated as to detract somewhat from the popular 
value of the discussion. 

" Tbe Soul of a Christian " is a book quite of its 
own order, and well deserves attention. The 
writer states bis object in his first sentence in this 
wise : " It is the purpose of this essay to describe 
the Christian life, as far as possible, in tbe terms, 
and with the methods, of psychology." The 
method pursued is discursive. The chapters have 
no very close connection, and the discussion in each 
is free. It is a book that offers itself to a piece- 
meal perusal, and rewards it by many flashes of 
light. It cannot fail to help us to a better under- 
standing of the connection of nervous and spiritual 
phenomena.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



The fourteen chapters on " The Doctrines of 
Grace," though not offered as sermons, have the 
proportion and independence of pulpit discourses. 
They are characterized by a warmth of feeling, 
quickness of intellect, and common-sense which 
should make them acceptable not only within but 
beyond the circle of assent to the doctrines involved 
in them. 

"The Riddle of the Universe" seems to be a 
misnomer as a title, for the author makes no riddle 
whatever of the world, denying most of that which 
others regard as mysterious. Professor Haeckel 
has been from the beginning, and still remains, a 
very flat-footed empiricist. Mental phenomena 
with him are simply a phase of physical phenomena. 
Rarely is a man so destitute of all the instruments 
and insights of spiritual knowledge as Professor 
Haeckel. If one with no better furniture of 
powers were to give himself to science, he would 
be regarded simply as a charlatan. The Professor 
has this merit : he is no way afraid of his own 
conclusions, and puts them unreservedly in lan- 
guage appropriate to them, without the disguise of 
a phraseology that belongs to a higher philosophy. 
The book is a loose statement of opinions, his own 
and others, on a variety of spiritual and quasi- 
spiritual themes. 

"Whence and Whither" is, like the previous 
volume, an effort to answer great questions out of 
meagre resources. Empirical monism is largely 
logomachy. It regards very diverse relations as 
alike because it has applied to them similar lan- 
guage. Its explanations are verbal, not real. 
At bottom, it is most utterly unempirical, since a 
spiritual experience is wholly wanting or boldly 
thrust aside. Listen to this explanation of memory, 
and depart being fed: "Memory is nothing but 
the psychical aspect of the preservation of physio- 
logical form. Some sense-impression or its reaction 
has left a trace which in the general metabolism 
preserves its form, for every particle discarded is 
replaced in the very same mode of grouping by 
another particle of the same kind, so that the 
structure remains the same in spite of the change 
of the material, and possesses the capability of 
producing the same kind of feeling" (page 20). 
In noticing a book, it may be one's duty to give 
some intimation of what persons would probably 
be pleased with it. We have no more convenient 
phrase at hand than that of Lincoln : Those who 
like this sort of thing will find this the sort of 
thing they will like. JoHN BASCOM. 



WHEN " The International Monthly " was established 
a year ago, the announcement was made that many of 
its articles would be reprinted in book form. The first 
fruits of this promise appear in the shape of a volume, 
now issued, which contains Senator Rambaud's schol- 
arly monograph upon " The Expansion of Russia." The 
volume bears the imprint of the International Monthly, 
Burlington, Vermont, since the Macmillan Co. no 
longer act as the publishers. 



BRIEFS ON !N~E\v BOOKS. 



Some notable A trul y noble P iece of bibliographical 
bibliographical work is the " Catalogue of the Dante 
work on Dante. Collection" presented by Professor 
Willard Fiske to the Cornell University Library. 
This catalogue, the work of Mr. Theodore Wesley 
Koch, is now complete in two volumes containing 
an aggregate of over six hundred large double- 
columned pages. A first part, covering " Dante's 
Works," was issued over two years ago ; the remain- 
ing section (which is five or six times the larger of 
the two), is a bibliography of "Works on Dante," 
and has just now appeared. It is a work of amazing 
industry, including references to a great mass of 
fugitive material, and even to critical reviews of the 
more important modern works. The complete cata- 
logue includes more titles than have ever before 
been brought together in any work of Dante bibli- 
ography. Not the least interesting feature of this 
work is the introductory chapter written by Pro- 
fessor Fiske, in which he tells how the collection 
was brought together, and makes some extremely 
interesting statements by way of comparison be- 
tween Dante and the other world-poets. It seems 
that as regards editions, translations, and commen- 
taries, Dante occupies a higher place than Homer, 
Shakespeare, or Goethe. His fama mondiale has 
resulted in more than seventy distinct translations 
into English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, 
Greek, and Latin, with perhaps a dozen more into 
other languages and dialects. In this comparative 
reckoning, Homer has about fifty versions, and 
Shakespeare hardly more than thirty. During the 
present century alone, there have been about four 
hundred and forty Italian editions of the " Divine 
Comedy." The Cornell Dinte Collection now num- 
bers seven thousand bound volumes, besides other 
material, and more than twenty-five thousand cards 
are needed for its catalogue. These facts we take 
from Mr. Koch's pamphlet on "The Growth and Im- 
portance of the Cornell Dante Collection," published 
simultaneously with the " Catalogue." Another 
pamphlet by Mr. Koch, also just published, is a 
hand-list of the framed portraits and other Dante 
pictures in the same collection. There is a thor- 
oughness about the way in which all this work has 
been done that commands our admiration, and Cor- 
nell University is certainly to be congratulated both 
upon its Dante library and the accomplished cus- 
todian thereof. 

The " Riverside Biographical Series " 
is inaugurated by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Company with three en- 
tertaining volumes one on Andrew Jackson by 
Mr. William Garrott Brown, one on James B. 
Eads by his grandson Mr. Louis How, and one on 
Benjamin Franklin by Mr. Paul Elmer More. Mr. 
Brown's account of the hero of New Orleans is a 
rarely impartial account of a career which, as he 
observes, has always made stanch friends or bitter

enemies, leaving the reader, it may be, with a con- 
fused sense of Jackson's proper place in the hearts 
of his countrymen, even while it stimulates him to 
form an opinion of his own upon the data abun- 
dantly brought forth. From Jackson to Eads is a 
long step, from whatever point of view ; and Mr. 
How has found a congenial and pious task in 
extolling the virtues of his kinsman with consid- 
erable and pardonable enthusiasm and some little 
skill in seeking and disclosing the critical momenta 
of his long and most useful life. The St. Louis 
Bridge and the New Orleans jetties have made 
Eads's fame secure, and are sufficiently well known; 
Mr. How rescues an account of his services to his 
country at the outbreak of the war between the 
States as well, though a more detailed history of 
his building of the Western flotilla of ironclads 
would have been welcome. A complete change of 
style is to be noted in Mr. Move's account of 
Franklin, a certain lightness of touch and thorough 
appreciation of the real homely humor with which 
Goodman Richard's life is so fully seasoned per- 
vading his pages. The books are small and the 
lives are correspondingly brief ; but they are all 
worthy the men they celebrate. Portraits add 
to their value in each case. 

The name of Mr. J. H. Crawford is 
not much known in English letters, 
but his "Autobiography of a Tramp " 
( Longmans, Green, & Co.), with its delightful flavor 
of out-of-door life and freedom from town miseries, 
will serve to make subsequent works from his hand 
something to be looked for. The hero of the story 
is a little English boy, and his tramping is done in 
his native island. It is interesting to see how like 
the most conventional of human beings this wan- 
dering lad was bred. He learned his lessons with 
the same sorrow and forced perseverance which 
most of us are called upon to pay as the price of 
education ; his father and mother loved him quite 
as much and expressed it quite as unsuccessfully as 
other parents, and his smiles and tears were no 
more common and no further apart than those of 
the most respectable urchin that ever hated the 
taste and feeling of soap. The pictures are quite 
as realistic as the text, bat far less artistic, being 
reproduced from photographs derived from vari -us 
and not always congruous sources. The book will 
be most pleasant to read in the season when snow 
has covered the ground and mist-gray clouds 
the sky.

"Shadowing*" (Little, Brown, & Co.), Mr. Laf-

esting if not deeply significant study of Japanese 
thought and feeling. In the dedication (to Pay- 
master Mitchell McDonald of the U. S. Navy) he 
says, "Herein I have made some attempt to satisfy 
your wish for a few more queer stories from the 
Japanese ' " ; and the purpose is one which the book 
fulfils. The stories are told with an effective direct-

ness which gives the impression of artless simplicity, 
an impression serving to heighten the sense of 
reality in them. For those who love to have the 
grotesque and the fanciful made real, and who find a 
charm in credulous sincerity, the book will have a 
distinct fascination. There is in it no direct attempt 
to explain Japanese civilization ; it is a volume to 
be read for pleasure rather than for information, 
yet the reader cannot help gaining from it a clearer 
notion of some of the elemental things in Japanese 
feeling and character. The long chapter on ''Jap- 
anese Female Names " is full of suggestions of the 
fundamentally poetic nature of Japanese thought, 
and the chapter on "Old Japanese Songs" may 
well serve to give suggestions to English poets. 
The strange iterations, the naive baldness, have an 
air of originality that is strikingly effective. The 
book ends with a group of studies and stories writ- 
ten by Mr. Hearn himself, having much of the 
same misty and dreamy character of those he merely 
reproduces. Mechanically the book is very at- 
tractive. 

There was a time, not very remote, 
when the works of the Rev. J. G. 
Wood were the sources of popular 
information concerning all that was interesting and 
curious in the life of animals. In much the same 
vein and for the same purpose that this author 
wrote his " Man and Beast, Here and Hereafter," 
Dr. Thomas G. Gentry privately published his 
" Life and Immortality," which now appears in a 
new edition nnder the title " Intelligence in Plants 
and Animals " (Donbleday, Page & Co.). The book 
contains a very extensive assortment of instances 
of curious and remarkable activities in plants and 
animals, which in the author's opinion indicate a 
higher order of intelligence than that usually cred- 
ited to them. This so-called intelligence is the basis 
upon which the author founds his arguments, scien- 
tific and scriptural, for the immortality of all forms 
of life. He details his own observations and those 
of others very freely, but withal not very critically. 
While in the main the facts reported will be ac- 
cepted, the terminology employed in the argument 
and the conclusions reached will meet with objec- 
tions. Notwithstanding the somewhat pronounced 
views of the author, the book is very interesting 
and will be a valuable addition to the literature of 
animal lore. Some excellent photographs from 
nature, by Mr. Dagmore, supplement the numerous 
illustrations. 

In "The Poetry of the Psalms" 
(Crowell) Dr. Henry van Dyke has 
given us a serviceable " Introduction 
to the study of the Psalms in English, as poetry." 
While the work contains little that is really new, 
yet we know of nothing quite like it in the way of 
a brief popular hand-book to the English Psalter. 
Dr. van Dyke dwells on the inadequacy of any 
translation, then proceeds to speak of the parallel- 
isms and the various kinds of lyrics. In the greatest

psalms he finds " deep and genuine love of nature," 
" a passionate sense of the beauty of holiness," " an 
intense joy in God." He seems not to have used 
the opportunity to emphasize the contrast, which 
many besides Matthew Arnold have observed, be- 
tween the poetic fervor of the King James Psalter 
and the utterly flat, stale, and wearisome monotony 
of our modern hymnology, which shows too little 
improvement over the Bay Psalm Book. We hope, 
too, the time will soon come when it will be deemed 
unnecessary to show that to study the Bible as lit- 
erature does not injure it as " a rule of faith and 
conduct." There is no good reason for not indent- 
ing paragraphs, the failure to do so often causing 
obscurity. Otherwise the volume is typographically 

beautiful. 

In the old days, Mrs. Martha Bocke'e 
Flint reminds us, it used to be the 
custom to administer tea made from 
the burrs of the Virginia stickseed (echinospermum 
Virginicum} for otherwise incorrigible cases of 
forgetful ness. Her whole book serves the same 
purpose, for no one can fail to retain such impres- 
sions as he gains from even glancing at the old- 
fashioned binding and paper label of " A Garden 
of Simples " (Scribner). It is such a book as 
Jeffery taught us to love, filled with all the delicate 
spirituality which Nature wears when seen with 
loving eyes, and imbued throughout with the charm 
of an elder day. The interests are often confes- 
sedly literary, as in the chapters on " A Posy from 
Spenser," or the " Flowers of Chaucer's Poems." 
From that they wander to delicately material 
things, such as honey, most poetic of human 
aliments, or " The Secrets of a Salad," no light 
topic to those who know. The history of America 
is not to be neglected in so eclectic a work, as little 
essays on " Liberty Tea " and " Indian Plant 
Names " attest. We can hardly imagine a pleas- 
anter gift to a charming woman, nor a more 
charming woman than she to whom such a book 
makes its full appeal. 

A recent volume in the " Leaders in 
Science " series (Putnam) is Mr. 
P. Chalmers Mitchell's life of the 
great English evolutionist and agnostic, Thomas 
H. Huxley. The perspective in which the author 
views his subject enables him to present a compre- 
hensive and well proportioned account of the life 
of this leader of the modern school of biologists. 
The author is himself an investigator of some note, 
and he renders a popular account of Huxley's most 
important contributions to the sciences of vertebrate 
and invertebrate anatomy, and of palaeontology, as 
well as to the development hypothesis. With equal 
clearness and fulness he relates Huxley's public 
services, and defines his position as the opponent 
of materialism and the exponent of agnosticism. 
His attitude on theological questions, as well as his 
ethical ideals, are clearly stated. The book does 
not aim to be an intimate biography. It is a sym-

cord writes, and publishes at his own expense, 
" Rudyard Reviewed," seemingly actuated by Mr. 
Kipling's dislike of America and Americans. At 
least, the critic does not attack the poet and trav- 
eller on aesthetic grounds in the ordinary accepta- 
tion of the term, but rather because the Anglo- 
Indian did not see in America all that her more 
devoted children would have him see. We think 
Mr. Peddicord has wasted both time and energy, 
and his residence in Oregon we take to be an en- 
couraging sign that regions nearer the East are 
largely indifferent to the expressed prejudices of a 
young man however distinguished. Miss Marie 
Corelli takes stronger ground in her " Patriotism 
or Self-Advertisement" (Lippincott), devoted to 
the excoriation, as a whole and in all of its parts, of 
that jingle so widely known as " An Absent-Minded 
Beggar." The punishment doubtless fits the crime ; 
but it makes us feel a little sorry for the criminal, 
nevertheless.

Mrs. Alice Dew-Smith's " Diary of

to what might otherwise be but " trifles light as

moment, the author tells us her experiences with 
tortoises and cats, with her husband's dictionaries 
and writing-desk, and with the problems that con- 
front one in building a house and furnishing it. 
The themes are often inconsequential and the expe- 
riences not particularly dramatic, but they furnish 
occasion for much vivacious comment upon the 
every-day affairs of life. The book is to be read 
in moments of relaxation when the reader is willing 
to be entertained without any stirring appeal to the 
imagination. Any single chapter of the forty-five 
can be read in ten minutes, and each is interesting in 
itself apart from the others, and leaves its distinct 
impression. On the other hand, the dream atmos- 
phere is not always compelling, and at times leaves 
one with the feeling that we have when over the 
breakfast-table a friend tells us a fantastic sleep 
experience of the night.

specimen of book-manufacturing in- 
genuity from the press of Mr. Frank S. Thayer, of 
Denver. The series began, as we remember, with 
a collection of photographic views of stuffed wild 
animals in their native lairs, the negatives for which, 
we were given to understand, had been secured at 
great peril and through years of patient waiting by 
a mighty hunter of the region who had been per- 
suaded or bribed to substitute a camera for his rifle 
in furtherance of the enterprise. This season Mr. 
Thayer's contribution is an album of fifteen photo- 
graphic reproductions in color, collectively entitled 
" Glimpses of the Grand Cafion of the Colorado," 
which we have inspected with caution. The plates 
are showy and effective, and are neatly mounted 
on ash-colored paper, and encased in flexible dec- 
orated covers. The pictures selected are represen- 
tative, and convey a good idea of the remarkable 
scenery of the region. 

A vein of delicate sentiment, a grace-

to realize vividly for the reader bits

Miss Myrtle Reed's " Later Love Letters of a 
Musician " (Putnam) a book to be enjoyed for its 
artistic charm. The letters, of which there are 
nearly thirty, each preceded by an appropriate 
phrase of music set alone on the page, are largely 
the expression of artistic responsiveness to the 
moods of nature or to some of the suggestive expe- 
riences of a musician's life. The book is very art- 
istically printed, and is one to be enjoyed for more 
than the first reading, a thing that cannot be said 
of many a more pretentious volume.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Transition Period " is a new volume in the 
" Periods of European Literature " (Scribner), edited 
by Professor Saintsbury. It is the work of Mr. G. 
Gregory Smith, and fills the gap between Mr. Snell's 
" Fourteenth Century " and the editor's forthcoming 
discussion of " The Earlier Renaissance." The author 
has brought much learning and no little animation to 
his somewhat thankless task of dealing with the most 
barren period of modern literature, a period which in- 
cludes Villon and Malory, the Scotch group of poets, 
the " Morgante Maggiore," the " Coplas " of Manrique, 
the " Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles," " Till Eulenspiegel," 
the " Imitation," the ballads, and the beginnings of the 
drama in France and England. 

Miss Estelle M. Kuril's little book on Sir Joshua 
Reynolds forms a welcome and pictorially attractive 
number in the "Riverside Art Series" (Houghton). 



The volume is apparently meant to be in some sort a 
text-book, or an elementary manual for the teacher, 
and hence its style is simple and its information mainly 
rudimentary. There is an introductory outline of 
Reynolds's life, together with some general appreciation 
of his work; but the text is largely a running com- 
mentary on the pictures, of which there is about one 
to each chapter, making seventeen in all. These are 
well chosen and handsomely reproduced. 

Fifty pages of introduction, a hundred pages of notes, 
and three hundred pages of extracts are, roughly speak- 
ing, the contents of the volume of " Selections from the 
Poetry of Lord Byron " which Dr. Frederick I. Car- 
penter has prepared for the series of " English Read- 
ings " published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. This is 
one of the best books of the admirable series in which 
it appears, and was rather more needed than any of the 
others. No one to-day wants the whole of Byron, and 
a book which will help us to keep in mind the best of 
him does a real service to literature. The estimate 
made by the editor is sympathetic, yet carefully dis- 
criminating, and the judgments expressed are in the 
main temperate and sound. 

With the appearance of Volume XVIII. (containing 
the remainder of the short stories) the " Shenandoah " 
edition of the novels and stories of Mr. Frank R. 
Stockton which has been in course of publication by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons during the past year, 
reaches temporary completion. Like all of Messrs. 
Scribner's well-known subscription sets, the mechanical 
form of the " Shenandoah " edition could hardly be 
improved upon. Mr. Stockton may well be envied the 
distinction conferred upon him by his publishers, for it 
is not often that an author has the satisfaction of seeing 
his work presented in so beautiful a form. The set 
should take a prominent place on the shelves of every 
admirer of Mr. Stockton's peculiar and inimitable 
genius. 

"The Beginnings of English Literature," by Mr. 
Charlton M. Lewis, is a small volume published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. " Its purpose is to give to those 
who do not, for the present at least, require an intimate 
acquaintance with Old and Middle English authors, 
such a knowledge of their characteristics and historical 
relations as may serve for an introduction to the study 
of the Elizabethan and later periods." It offers a com- 
promise between the very elementary books and those 
which are made unduly repellant by being crammed 
with minor names and facts. It includes many extracts, 
and is altogether a readable and useful little book. 

Professor J. Scott Clark's "Study of English and 
American Poets " (Scribner) is a companion volume to 
the author's " Study of English Prose Writers," pub- 
lished over two years ago. The method is the same 
in both volumes. Each author treated is given a biog- 
raphy, a page or two of references to critical apprecia- 
tions, and something like thirty or forty pages of clas- 
sified excerpts from the best critics, together with 
illustrative passages from the poet himself. Twenty 
poets are considered altogether, six of them being 
Americans. We have great confidence in the value of 
this method of studying literature, and believe that 
teachers will find these volumes by Professor Clark a 
useful adjunct to their work. 

Mr. Stopford Brooke's erstwhile "Primer," later 
known by the simpler title of " English Literature," has 
just made a third appearance, with an additional chap-

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1, 



ter by the author, and two supplementary chapters on 
American literature by Mr. George Rice Carpenter 
(Macmillan). Praise has long since been exhausted in 
dealiug with this little book, which, considering its lim- 
ited scope, is as good as could well be imagined. Speak- 
ing of Mr. Brooke's added chapter, however, we are 
bound to take exception to the statement that Morris 
and Rossetti and Mr. Swinburne have remained " out 
of sympathy with modern life." The poets of " Jenny " 
and " Poems by the Way " and " Songs before Sunrise " 
need no defence against such a charge, and it is sur- 
prising indeed that Mr. Brooke should have expressed 
such an opinion of them. 

Having exhausted the bibliographical possibilities of 
the longer novels of Charles Dickens in a volume issued 
some two or three years ago, Mr. F. G. Kitton has 
turned his attention to the " minor writings," and the 
results of his work in this field are contained in the 
latest volume of the " Book-Lover's Library " (A. C. 
Armstrong & Son). The amount of labor necessary 
to identify the numerous periodical contributions and 
miscellaneous papers of the novelist cannot easily be 
estimated, but Mr. Kitton's unfailing enthusiasm for 
his subject has prevailed over all difficulties. Taken 
together, the two volumes form as complete and exact 
a bibliographical record of the literary productions of 
Charles Dickens as could be desired. 



NOTES. 



" The Book of Daniel," edited by Dr. S. R. Driver, 
is a volume of " The Cambridge Bible for Schools and 
Colleges," published by the Macmillan Co. 

" A Reader in Physical Geography for Beginners," 
by Professor Richard E. Dodge, is a recent educational 
publication of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" Springtime Flowers," by Miss Mae Ruth Norcross, 
is a book of " easy lessons in botany " for very young 
children, published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. 

" The Civilization of the East," by Dr. Fritz Hommel, 
and " Plant Life and Structure," by Dr. E. Dennert, are 
the latest of the "Temple Primers," published by the 
Macmillan Co. 

" A Hero and Some Other Folk," being a volume of 
essays by Mr. William A. Quayle, has reached a third 
edition, and bears the imprint of Messrs. Jennings & 
Pye, Cincinnati. 

Mr. Samuel Usher, of Boston, publishes a memorial 
address, by Dr. R. S. Storrs, upon the late Professor 
Edwards Amasa Park, of Andover. The book may be 
obtained from Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The American Book Co. publish a " Higher Algebra," 
by Professor John F. Downey. They also send us an 
41 Elementary Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene for 
Higher Grammar Grades," by Dr. Winfield V. Hall. 

In addition to their collective edition of the writings 
of Count Tolstoy, the Messrs. Crowell publish, in a 
form of its own, a new volume of " Essays, Letters, 
and Miscellanies," the translations by Mr. Aylmer 
Maude and others. 

"The Cocktail Book," further described as "A 
Sideboard Manual for Gentlemen," is a recent publica- 
tion of Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. It is a very small 
book indeed, but its dimensions are by no means 
proportioned to its usefulness. 



44 Shakespeare's Life and Work," by Mr. Sidney Lee t 
as now published by the Macmillan Co., is an abridg- 
ment of the author's " Life " of the poet, prepared 
chiefly for the use of students. It retains all the es- 
sentials of the larger work, although reduced to some- 
thing like half its compass. 

44 Kant's Cosmogony," as embodied chiefly in hi 
44 Natural History and Theory of the Heavens," is given 
us in an English version by Dr. W. Hastie, who has- 
not only made the translation, but has also supplied it 
with an introduction and other editorial apparatus. 
The work is issued in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

44 Famous Geometrical Theorems and Problems " is 
the subject which Mr. W. W. Rupert has undertaken 
to discuss, for the instruction and entertainment of 
mathematically-minded persons, in a series of four 
pamphlets, published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 
Other monographs in this series will follow, all under 
the general editorship of Mr. Webster Wells. 
f* "Edwin Booth and his Contemporaries" (Page), ed- 
ited by Brander Mathews and Lawrence Hutton, is a 
new edition of a work first published about fifteen years 
ago. It is a collection of chapters, by various hands, 
upon the English and American actors and actresses 
who have been prominent during the last half-century, 
and is furnished with an interesting series of portraits. 

The Macmillan Co. announce that they have acquired 
the publication rights of Mr. James Ford Rhodes's 
" History of the United States from the Compromise 
of 1850," hitherto issued under the imprint of Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers. A new edition of the work, em- 
bodying a few minor changes and typographical correc- 
tions, will be issued at once. 

Two interesting speeches shortly to be issued in 
printed form by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. are 
Lord Roseberry's " Questions of Empire " and Hon. 
Joseph H. Choate's " Abraham Lincoln," both of which 
were delivered in November last the former before 
the students of the University of Glasgow and the lat- 
ter before the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution. 

"The Story of American History for Elementary 
Schools," by Mr. Albert F. Blaisdell, is a first book 
of our national history published by Messrs. Ginn & 
Co. A still more elementary work is " America's 
Story for America's Children," by Miss Mara L. Pratt, 
published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. There are 
to be five parts of this work, forming a series of 
graded reading-books. 

Professor Moses Coit Tyler, of Cornell University, 
died on Dec. 28 at his home in Ithaca. Professor 
Tyler's career was a most active and distinguished one. 
He was born in Griswold, Conn., in 1835, was graduated 
from Yale in 1857, from 1867 to 1881 was Professor 
in the English department of the University of Michi- 
gan, and from 1881 to his death was Professor of 
American history at Cornell. He was author of many 
books, a frequent writer in the periodicals, and was a 
contributor to THE DIAL from the beginning of the 
paper. 

" The Religion of Abraham Lincoln," a pamphlet 
published by the G. W. Dillingham Co., reproduces a 
correspondence that passed some years ago between 
Colonel R. G. Ingersoll and General C. H. T. Collis. 
The purport of it is to refute the charge that Lincoln 
was essentially a Voltairean in his religious attitude; 
but the documents prove little either way. Lincoln 
and Voltaire were about as far apart as possible in 



1901.]

temperament, bat in the matter of their fundamental 
convictions there is much to be said for Ingersoll's 
opinion. 

" Patriotic Eloquence Relating to the Spanish- 
American War and Its Issues " (Scribner) is the title 
of a compilation made by Messrs. Robert L. Fulton 
and Thomas C. Trueblood. The selections range all 
the way from the pinchbeck rhetoric of Senator 
Beveridge and the platitudes of Senator Depew, to the 
genuine oratory, inspired by patriotism of the old- 
fashioned sort, of such men as Mr. Carl Schurz, Dr. 
Henry van Dyke, Senator Tovrae, and Senator Hoar.

SHARPS AND FLATS 



Two /iew> volumes of Sketches and Verse collated 
by SLASON THOMPSON. Two Vols., 12mo. $2.50. 

From " The This is merely the cream of his daily offering to a 

Boston public that for once was not unappreciative of the worth

anew the spontaneity of wit that was ever infused by kindliness, even 
when its keenness ran close to the caustic. And it is American, the 
very essence of Americanism without a suspicion of the screaming eagle 
to make an American of finer fibre squirm. Story, epigram, jest, and 
rhyme follow here in happy sequence." 

" * Sharps and Flats ' are curiously original little From " The 
volumes. Mirror-like, they reflect the daily changing Chicago 
moods of the writer, his growth under varying influ- Evening Post." 
ences of the living world of the day and the culture which came from 
association with the great society of books. The social aspect of 
America shines out through the quaint humor and gentle satire. As 
Mr. Thompson writes, the exhaustless gayety of Eugene Field's daily 
life is better preserved in the pages of ' Sharps and Flats ' than in any 
other volumes of his collected works. Here, too, appears his versatile 
interest in men and events, and here, too, his quick sense of humor 
grasps human folly."

THE NOVEL AND THE PLAY. 

The most aggravating of all critics is the critic 
who asserts and gives no reasons. A writer in a 
recent number of THE DIAL tells ns that the novel 
is a finer art-form than the play, and practically the 
only reason he offers to back his opinion is that the 
first form is contemporary and the second archaic. 
Archaic ! What great art has not been archaic at 
the time of its production? Gray remarks, in one 
of his letters, that the language of poetry is never 
the language of the age or of common life. Shake- 
speare's speech was undoubtedly strange to the 



Elizabethans. The well-Ian guaged Daniel " was 
the scholarly type of that day, and Daniel is as 
modern as Sir Edwin Arnold. The same is true of 
thought and character. If either is great, it cannot 
possibly conform to accepted conventions. What 
can we suppose that even the Athenians made of 
the Prometheus or the Agamemnon or the Persian 
ghost of .ZEschylus ? As we can see in Aristophanes, 
these were rather musty fables to them. The dis- 
play of the Panathenaic festival, or the riot of the 
Eleusinian mysteries, were much more to their 
minds. Alleyne, the theatrical manager of Shake- 
speare's time, has left it on record that he made 
the greater part of his fortune by showing bears. 
The Spaniards tolerated Calderon as an appanage 
of the Inquisition, but their real joy was in the 
burning of heretics. The auto da fe was doubtless 
to them a sweet contemporary thing. Goethe and 
Schiller, by the expenditure of infinite labor, built 
up a theatre in Weimar. They forced great tragedy 
and comedy, the use of verse and the right reading 
of it, down the German throat. But was their 
patient grateful to them ? Not a bit Goethe was 
forced to resign the directorship of the theatre by 
a performing dog. 

I hope the writer referred to will pardon me if I 
offer him some reasons why the novel might be a 
finer art than the play. In the first place, it has a 
larger canvas. The average novel has from five to 
ten times more words in it than the average play. 
If there is anything in big battalions, Xerxes ought 
always to overwhelm Leonidas. In the second 
place, the novel, though a hybrid, may possibly in- 
herit the qualities of its various ancestors. It may 
have the pure emotional gush of the lyric, the orb- 
icular sweep of the epic, the intensity of the drama. 
In the third place, it is gifted with omniscience, a 
power which the epic shares with it, but which is 
denied to other art forms. In the fourth place, it 
can perform the offices of the scene-painter, the 
actor, the gas-man, the usher in the body of the 
theatre, and the critic in the next day's print. And 
lastly, it requires no such attention on the part of 
the reader as does the more abstract form of the 
play, which, especially if written in verse, is the most 
concentrated work of the human mind. In reading 
a novel, we sit at feast like a Persian King, and have 
one servant to cut our food, another to put it in our 
mouths, and a third to work our jaws for us. 

I am not mocking. These advantages the novel 
possesses, and they in great part account for its 
popularity. But for the final result of greatness 
they are fallacious and break down. The immense 
expenditure of words in a novel is a solution of con- 
tinuity and defeats the purpose of an art-work to 
grasp and body forth a definite conception. Each 



34 



THE DIAL 



[Jan, 16, 



tidal wave of words washes out the record of its 
predecessor. And the mixture of forms in the 
novel is an element of weakness rather than of 
strength. An olla podrida is neither as good for 
the digestion nor as tempting to the palate as a 
course dinner where the flavor of every dish is con- 
served. And the all-embracing view of the novelist 
carries with it a quality of vagueness, so much so 
that the epistolary and biographical forms of the 
novel, in which this power is resigned, are perhaps 
the most vivid and intense. And the combination 
of services which the novelist offers to perform for 
us tends to distraction ; it is ruinous to total effect. 
The actors get in the way of the plot, the scene- 
painting interferes with the dialogue, and the lyrical 
or didactic effusions of the author in person spoil 
the illusion. Most serious of all, the ease with which 
a novel can be read weakens the mind. A good 
play, though so much shorter than a novel, demands 
a far greater amount of attention, and so tends to 
fasten itself upon the brain. 

In general, the question between the play and 
the novel is a question of law or liberty, discipline 
or license. I like to image the play as a troop of 
Spanish cdbelleros or conquestadores, mounted on 
the steeds of inspiration, armored with verse, armed 
with thought, and moving in instinctive obedience 
to one will; while the novel is a vast, lawless, dis- 
organized mass of Mexican or Inca barbarians, 
howling and hurling itself on the compact body of 
iron-clad men. The mob may submerge the few 
for a time, but it must eventually be beaten back 
and reduced to submission and slavery. 

We learn from the article already cited that the 
play tends to base itself on the novel. Certainly. 
It has always done so. The plays of the Greek 
tragedians were based on the cyclic poems which 
were the novels of antiquity, and which have per- 
ished. Shakespeare and his circle based their art 
on Italian novella, many of which were as good 
fiction as is written to-day. The order of life is for 
the soul to ascend from the body. The instinct of 
mankind is not satisfied until the pure kernel of an 
art-work is disengaged from its mixed and impure 
mass of wrappings and enfoldments. 

Though the writer I am considering regards the 
novel as a finer art-form than the play, he does not 
assert that his greatest typical novelist is superior 
to the typical dramatist. He only insists on a cer- 
tain equality between the two. He is willing to 
concede that Shakespeare was a respectable sort of 
a person who did good in his day, though he is 
hardly up to our modern standards of democratic 
art. Personally, I feel disposed to light a hecatomb 
of expiation to Shakespeare for bringing him, even 
for defense, into competition with Balzac. But this 
is a wrong feeling. Shakespeare must stand his 
trial like any other author. Every generation sum- 
mons the favorites of the past to the bar of its 
opinion, questions them as to their birth and con- 
dition and present means of livelihood, and judges 
and sentences them after its own sweet will, 



judging itself at the same operation. And this 
is necessary and right. Literature in Mortmain, 
literature held in the dead hand, is as dangerous 
as literature of new-born bounce and bluster. So 
let us on to the comparison. 

Those who have done me the honor to read my 
notes on literature published in THE DIAL will not 
suspect me of holding a brief for style. Not that 
I do not in my own mind worship style, but I hold 
it a result, not a means. I believe it follows the 
accumulation of thoughts, and the kindling concep- 
tion of character. But when it so arrives, it is the 
final stamp of greatness. Now, as the previous 
writer practically admits, there is in this respect 
no possible parallel between Shakespeare and Bal- 
zac. Balzac in style is plebeian, is home-made, 
is humdrum. In a nation of graceful writers, he 
is the dancing bear of prose. Shakespeare, with 
a great many people, is mainly and above all 
the master, the magician of words. He may be 
slightly less clear and faultless than the Greeks, 
but he is infinitely more gorgeous in color and 
varied in carving, and there is more of him that 
is good than there is of all the Greek poets put 
together. This matter of wealth of expression in 
Shakespeare is very little realized. Because each 
of our greater English poets has some distinctive 
quality of his own, we are apt to think of them as 
inferior indeed to Shakespeare, but still to some 
extent comparable. As far as expression is con- 
cerned, they could almost all of them be quarried 
out of Shakespeare. The peak of Teneriffe is a 
striking enough object in its isolation, but transport 
it to the Andes or the Himalayas and it would sink 
to a mole-hill lost in the vastnesses about it. The 
matter of expression, therefore, to many people the 
most important of all, is settled for Shakespeare 
against Balzac. 

Most great poets are philosophers as well. They 
justify the ways of God to man, or defend the 
ways of man to God. Dante is the final expression 
of the Catholicism of the Fathers ; Calderon of the 
Catholicism of the Inquisition ; Milton of Calvin- 
ism. Goethe gave full literary form to the new 
scientific method and thought of Bacon and Frank- 
lin. His philosophy is the philosophy of egotism 
and utility. It must be admitted that when we 
come to assess the philosophy of Shakespeare, it is 
difficult to put one's hand on his central thought. 
He unquestionably imbibed Pyrrhonism from 
Montaigne, and Pyrrhonism is not constructive. 
But he is always thinking of the mighty problems 
of the soul, of the destinies of humanity. He wan- 
ders around the walled chamber of the world like 
a mightier Hamlet stabbing the arras everywhere 
to find out what is beyond. As for Balzac, he can 
hardly be said to have any thought at all except 
the ever-pressing one to get and spend as much 
money as possible. He wrote in " The Alchemist " 
about the research into the Absolute. But the 
Absolute has mighty little to do with the book, 
which is mainly concerned with the physiognomy 



1901.] 



THE DIAL,

of an old bouse and the fate of a lot of old furni- 
ture. When Balzac was well through his " Human 
Comedy," he seemed to have felt that there was 
something wanting to it. He was like the architect 
who left the staircase out of his house and had to 
add it on the outside. Balzac wrote " Louis Lam- 
bert." An American editor of this hook has read 
into it marvellous and immeasurable meanings. 
Any hook can become a fetish if one gives one's 
mind up to it and shuts out all other sources of 
information. Wilkie Collins, in one of his novels, 
has an old butler who has made a Bible of "Rob- 
inson Crusoe," and finds in it the most amazing 
oracles for every event. To me " Louis Lambert " 
seems a vague rehash of Swedenborgian or Hindoo 
philosophy crammed for the occasion. It utterly 
lacks the value which hard, original thinking, in 
whatever method to whatever end, possesses for 
the human mind. " The Angels are white," says 
Lambert, and that is about his most valuable con- 
tribution to vision or thought. On the whole, then, 
Balzac as a thinker is of no class whatever ; whereas 
Shakespeare wears the imperial purple. 

There remains the presentation of reality by the 
two the reproduction of the aspects of Nature 
and Art, and the creation of human figures. It 
may be noted that Shakespeare is almost all out-of- 
doors ; whereas Balzac is ever confined to the 
rooms of mansion or cottage to the streets and 
alleys of towns. Pretty much the whole of Nature 
is in Shakespeare, but little of the art or handiwork 
of man. Balzac has a real point of superiority in 
his architecture and interiors, in which he surpasses 
everybody. As for the human crowds of the two, 
what shall I say ? In making a comparison here, I 
can only do like the critic I have been criticising, 
offer assertions unbacked by reasons. For it is 
almost impossible to give reasons for the love or 
the affections which rise within us. If anyone 
thinks Eugenie Grandet superior to Juliet, or 
Mudeste Mignon to Imogen ; if he likes Caesar 
Birrotteau better than Dogberry, and believes old 
Grandet a better drawn figure than Shylock, 
why, one can only avert one's eyes, turn down the 
first crossing, and let him go his misguided way 
alone. But I think I may assert that Balzac's 
people are all book folk. They never have had 
cut the umbilical cord which binds them to the 
printed page. They do not stray out into real life 
and become our friends and loves, as do the char- 
acters of even lesser men than Shakespeare Scott 
and Dickens, for instance. One forgets them in 
their multitude until one takes the book up again, 
when the skill, the science, the power of the author 
bring them back. And another thing may be 
asserted : they are all small, figurines rather than 
statues. Balzac never created one of those typical 
human figures that sum up a race, or resume once 
for all some abstract quality of life. Molie're and 
Old Dumas are tbe most Shakespearean souls of 
France. Alceste and Tartuff are eternal, and 
D' Ai tagnan is the incarnation of the Gallic spirit 



He is as much the human symbol of France as 
Don Quixote is of Spain, Hamlet of Germany, or 
Robinson Crusoe of England. The typical figure 
of America is What shall I say ? Mr. Barnes 
of New York. 

A writer may be greater than his age, but, even 
unconsciously, he is apt to render in his work the 
lineaments of his time. It is important, then, that 
the age has something of splendor or greatness to 
give him. Shakespeare came at the culminating 
period of the young manhood of the English race. 
His age was the age of new-born liberty, of revo- 
lutions in thought and discovery in the world. It 
was the age that beat back the Armada. Balzac's 
age was wearied with the excesses of the Revolution 
and the Napoleonic era ; it was an age of galvanized 
monarchy and scarecrow empire. It was weak and 
futile and corrupt. It was the age which fell at 
Sedan. 

Balzac's gift is the modern gift, the scientific gift, 
the gift of observation. Lord Bacon claimed that 
his method did away with the necessity of genius 
in philosophy, that it opened the paths of science 
to the average intelligence. The same can be said 
of the scientific method in literature. Anyone can 
sit down with a note book before a given quantity 
of life and record and report it. But the art so 
produced is open to the charge which Plato mis- 
takenly brought against all poetry that it is an 
imitation of an imitation, reality at third remove. 
Only where the poet aereates the mass of material 
given him from without with the inspiration which 
comes to him within, where he glimpses the uni- 
versal through the actual, do we get an art product 
which is valid and valuable for all time. 

Perhaps the best way to get at the value of any 
large art-work is to estimate the sum-total of emo- 
tion it produces. What is our final impression of 
Balzac's work ? Do we not feel, when we are done 
with it, as though we had wakened from an all-night 
debauch, with a headache and a bad taste in our 
mouths? Do we not feel as though we had been 
moving through some mighty marsh clothed with 
fantastic vegetation, with fetid exhalations rising 
from it as incense to expiring suns ? Do we not say 
to ourselves, ' What is the use? 'T is a sick and a 
sordid and a sorry world. Let 's cut our throats." 
On the other hand, what is our legacy of impression 
from Shakespeare? Is it not that we have been 
living in a land of sunlight and wooded shade, co- 
equal heirs with men of mighty ardor and women 
of holy flame? That thunder-storms might come, 
indeed, and seem to wreck our world, but that 
everything would spring fresher from their passing; 
that our minds would leap to their shock, our 
muscles brace with their tension, until we would 
feel that we were seventeen feet high and of Achil- 
lean form and visage, until we would want to 
climb to the summits of the earth and shake our 
fists in the face of fate ? Which is the mightier 
artist, which is tbe better gift to mankind?

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

MR. HOWARD PYLE AND THE AMERICAN 

FARMER. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In some brief comments on Mr. Howard Pyle's illus- 
trations for the holiday volume of Mr. Markham's 
poems, a writer in your issue of Dec. 1 shows a fine 
appreciation of the artist's strong elemental treatment 
of the subjects ranged for his pencil, and a correct con- 
ception of art values. Noting this breadth of view upon 
one side, it is surprising to find what appears to be a 
somewhat narrow range of sympathy upon another. 
The critic assumes, apparently, that in the " pictorial 
allegory " which forms the frontispiece of the volume 
in question, the artist had in mind the American farmer, 
and that the effect was decidedly unflattering to this 
worthy citizen. To refute this idea seems an exegesis 
of the obvious. It is, at the outset, hardly reasonable 
to suppose that the poem, written avowedly in com- 
mentary upon Millet's picture of the same name, could 
refer to any American working-man, except in so far as 
he like any other had become a type of degraded labor. 
The Millet peasant is not even a type of the ordinary 
French laborer, but only of the toiler brutalized by ex- 
cessive and unrelieved toil. He is a man who has had 
no inlet of joy, no outlet of delight, in his labor. As 
Mr. Markham himself has said, " ' The Man With the 
Hoe ' is, in a large way, the type of any man who has 
forgotten to grow, who has forgotten that man does not 
live by bread alone." This overworked drudge, who 
will have to be born again many times to get out of 
the basement strata of life into the height of " the 
upper chamber opening toward the sky," does exist 
amongst us. He sweeps our streets ; he bakes our 
bread; he digs our coal; he may even write our law 
briefs, or preach our sermons. Civilization will not be 
civilization till somehow he is made his best, whether 
by educating his grandfather in order that he, the de- 
scendant, may have a will to do and dare, or by edu- 
cating the man himself, and giving him time, like 
Browning's hero, to get all the gain there is from hav- 
ing been a man. 

Mr. Pyle, like Mr. Markham, sees in the Man with 
the Hoe, not the American farmer, though possibly a 
" farm hand," slaving from dawn till long past dark, 
might represent the type. He sees only the bended back 
that has borne the heat and burden of the day down 
through the ages; he sees that the Man with the Hoe 
is the type of industrial oppression in all lines of labor, 
the man shapen (or misshapen) by the pitiless ten- 
dencies and injustices of our civilization.

LIBRARY PRIVILEGES FOR RURAL DISTRICTS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On the first of January, 1901, there occurred in the 
town of Van Wert, Ohio, county-seat of Van Wert 
county, an event whose significance the future alone 
will reveal: the dedication of America's first county 
library. Most of the cities and many of the larger 
towns and villages of our country have their public 
libraries; it remained for this Ohio county to inaugurate 
a movement that may eventually bring library privileges 
where they are most needed, viz., to the rural districts. 

The library is named The Brumback Library, in 



honor of its founder, the late J. S. Brumback, a prom- 
inent and wealthy citizen. A special law made pos- 
sible by the Brumback heirs was passed by the Ohio 
legislature, providing for the maintenance of the library 
by the county, and this was almost unanimously favored 
and approved by the people throughout the county 
concerned. The library building is one of the most 
substantial and beautiful in the country. It has a 
capacity of 100,000 volumes, represents a value of 
$50,000, and under the new decennial appraisement 
will have an annual income of $8,000. 

Under the stimulus already given, Cincinnati has ex- 
tended its field of library work to all parts of Hamil- 
ton county, and several other counties have been dis- 
cussing the advisability of imitating the example of 
Van Wert county. The movement was fully discussed 
and heartily endorsed at the recent annual meeting of 
the Ohio Library Association. 

Two thoughts which were especially emphasized in 
the dedicatory exercises may be worth repeating here: 
First, we have in the bequest of a county library one 
of the few philanthropies that tend to benefit all the 
people, country as well as town. Our philanthropy 
has heretofore directed its efforts chiefly to the eleva- 
tion of the city or town only. Second, the recent 
census, which shows how great during the past decade 
has been the migration from county to city, is an appeal 
to American citizenship to look in the future more to 
the welfare and enlightenment of our great rural pop- 
ulation, the bone and sinew of our national life.

TEN GREAT AUTHORS OF THE CENTURY. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

One of the greatest authors of all time is Jeremy 
Bentham. He is the father of Utilitarianism, and to 
him more than to anyone else do we owe a rational 
system of jurisprudence. Bentham has furnished more 
ideas to legal writers than any other man of the century. 

Arthur Schopenhauer is the greatest metaphysician 
that ever lived. His " World as Will and Representa- 
tion " is the best solution of the World Riddle ever 
offered. He is the father of Wagner in music. He 
originated a system of philosophy Pessimism. He 
was one of the greatest scholars of the century; the 
only man who ever made metaphysics popular. 

Auguste Comte was one of the greatest men that 
ever lived. He originated the science of Sociology; 
and it is to his impetus that we owe the great social 
evolution now going on. His conception of Humanity 
is the grandest ever originated; his conception of the 
destiny of man the truest. He knew more about Re- 
ligion than any man in the nineteenth century. He is 
one of the least appreciated men of his age. He did 
for Sociology what Darwin did for Biology. 

Charles Darwin's was the most argumentative mind 
of the century. He discovered the most useful law 
ever known to science, and he proved it to an opposing 
public. The race will remember him as one of her 
great men for all time. He revolutionized the science 
of Biology all science. It is to him that the true 
theory of things is possible in the twentieth century. 

What Darwin did for Biology, Herbert Spencer did 
for Psychology. Besides, he has systematized all 
science in his Synthetic Philosophy. He is the greatest 
Individualist of the race, and the last great one. 

Karl Marx is one of the master-minds of man. He 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



37 



is the father of Socialism, the making of the race 
into one class, with equal rights, equal opportunities, 
the realization of that better life hoped for by all and 
sought after by so few. His conception of the iniqui- 
ties of modern society will be used as an indictment by 
reformers from now on till the millennium. Of all men, 
he is the common man's best friend. He was one of 
the greatest scholars that ever lived. 

Lester F. Ward is the most practical philosopher the 
century has produced. His Dynamic Sociology com- 
pleted the science Comte began. His psychic factor in 
civilization shows wherein Darwin's great law does not 
hold good in society. But Ward came so late that his 
real influence will be in the twentieth century. 

The great trouble with light literature in the last 
century is that it is almost without exception time- 
serving, not serving all time. George Eliot is the only 
writer of light literature who has any claim to real 
greatness. She has attempted to apply the great con- 
cepts of Bentham and Comte and Spencer to every-day 
life. She has been called, not inappropriately, a female 
Shakespeare. She will be better appreciated in the 
new century. 

Guy de Maupassant is the most artistic story-teller 
the world has ever produced; Count Leo Tolstoi the 
most artistic novelist. Both are masters. Maupassant 
cared nothing for philosophy or morality. His one 
object was to tell his story. Tolstoi is so intent on 
giving his art its highest moral motive that he overlooks 
the intellectual, the chief merit of George Eliot. It 
will take the twentieth century to appreciate Tolstoi's 
high art. 

These are the preeminent authors of the nineteenth 
century. JACKSON BOYD.

COVENTRY PATMORE, His RELATIVES 
AND FRIENDS.* 

The multifarious interest of the two thick 
volumes containing Mr. Basil Champneys's 
Memoirs of Coventry Patmore goes far to make 
up for their somewhat disproportionate size. 
The work forms a readable though rather 
rambling account of Patmore, his relatives, his 
three household " Angels," his literary friends, 
which one may open at random with the assur- 
ance of finding something at least mildly inter- 
esting ; but we should have preferred a close- 
knit, comparatively concise biography, showing 
the figure of its hero clearly and in the due 
perspective though of course Mr. Champ- 
neys has adhered to his own view of Patmore's 
proportional importance. 

Outwardly Patmore's career was uneventful, 
and its main features may be briefly sketched. 
He was not a University man, and indeed the

two years he spent at the College de France, 
St. Germains, formed the only period of his 
life during which he was under regular tuition. 
As a boy he showed great precocity and a 
marked literary bent which his father, who was 
at once his companion and preceptor, industri- 
ously fostered. Authors were the heroes of his 
boyhood, and he used to tell later of his pil- 
grimage at sixteen to the house of Leigh Hunt, 
whose devoted admirer he then was. 

"... After I had waited in the little parlor at 
least two hours the door was opened and a most pic- 
turesque gentleman, with hair flowing nearly or quite 
to his shoulders, a beautiful velvet coat and a Vandyck 
collar of lace about a foot deep, appeared, rubbing his 
hands and smiling ethereally, and saying, without a 
word of preface or notice of my having waited so long, 
1 This is a beautiful world, Mr. Patmore! ' I was so 
struck by this remark that it has eclipsed all memory 
of what occurred during the remainder of my visit." 

Encouraged by his father, and fired by the 
appearance of the Tennyson volume of 1842, 
Patmore launched, in 1844, a little volume of 
poems which, being as full of promise as they 
were vulnerable, came in for both exaggerated 
praise and exaggerated contempt at the hand 
of the reviewers. " The Critic " kindly said of 
Patmore : 

" But if nature hath forbidden him to be a poet, the 
sooner he finds out his incapacity the better for himself 
and his friends; for it may save to society a valuable 
worker in some other field, while it spares to critics the 
irksome toil of fault-finding, to himself the pain of be- 
ing compelled to hear unwelcome truths, and to his 
friends mayhap the cost of maintaining a lank-ribbed 
author and a bare-footed family." 

"Maga," of course, fell foul of the new 
" cockney " poet in its usual style, the reviewer 
ending his diatribe against the " school " in 
general, and its alleged latest exponent in par- 
ticular, as follows : 

" This is the life into which the slime of the Keatses 
(sic) and Shelleys of former times has fecundated. 
The result was predicted a quarter of a century ago in 
this magazine nothing is so tenacious of life as the 
spawn of frogs the fry must become extinct in him. 
His poetry (thank Heaven) cannot corrupt into any- 
thing worse than itself." 

On the other hand, as we have said, Pat- 
more's initial volume was warmly praised in 
some of the reviews, and it was, as may now be 
noted, even rapturously received by a band of 
young men, themselves convention-breakers, 
who were then springing into prominence 
the Prae-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Possibly 
these young painters recognized a certain sim- 
ilarity of aim in their own productions and the 
verses of the new poet. At all events they used 
to carry the little volume about with them, and

"to read it at every moment of leisure." 
William Rossetti writes : 

" We admired the poems enormously, and I daresay 
that in the course of a couple of years we had read 
every one of them through 20 or 30 times. Gabriel 
was certain to talk about them to fellow-students at the 
R. A., etc., and more especially to Hunt, Millais, and 
Woolner." 

It was some years later that Patmore became 
personally known, through Woolner, to the 
Millais-Rossetti circle, who claimed him, it 
seems, as the representative in poetry of their 
principles, and got him to write for " The 
Germ," to the first number of which he sent a 
short poem, "The Seasons," which was later 
reprinted in " Tamerton Church Tower." Of 
his intercourse with the " Brotherhood " Pat- 
more says : 

" I was intimate with the Prse-Raphaelites when we 
were little more than boys together. They were all 
very simple, pure-minded, ignorant, and confident. . . . 
They could not even have printed the ' Germ ' without 
(pecuniary) assistance. I well remember Millais tri- 
umphantly flourishing before my eyes a cheque for 
150 which he got for ' The Return of the Dove to the 
Ark.' Once I was at a gathering of the Brethren and 
their friends, when Holman Hunt produced forty 
sketches, and said that any one might have them for a 
pound apiece. . . . Hunt attracted me personally more 
than any of the Pra-Raphaelites. He was heroically 
simple and constant in his purpose of primarily serving 
religion by his art, and had a Quixotic notion that it 
was absolutely obligatory upon him to redress every 
wrong that came under his notice. . . . Rossetti was 
in manners, mind, and appearance completely Italian. 
He had very little knowledge of or sympathy with En- 
glish literature; and always gave me the impression of 
tensity rather than intensity." 

When twenty-two or thereabouts Patmore 
felt for a time the unaccustomed pinch of want, 
he and his brother having been suddenly thrown 
upon their own resources through their father's 
failure and subsequent flight to the Continent. 
For a time the brothers struggled on in Grub 
Street fashion, managing to scrape together, 
through translations and chance hack-work, 
the few indispensable shillings from twenty- 
five to sixteen a week. At one time Coventry's 
finances were reduced to three and sixpence, 
which sum he seems to have recklessly spent on 
ices. This period of eclipse was ended through 
the kindly intervention of Monckton Milnes, 
who procured for Patmore a place in the Brit- 
ish Museum. Of Milnes's first encounter with 
Patmore a pleasant story was told by Mrs. 
Procter, which we quote in Mr. Gosse's words : 

"After a dinner at her house in 1846, Monckton 
Milnes said to her in the drawing-room, And who is 
your lean young friend in the frayed coat-cuffs ? ' ' Oh, 
Mr. Milnes,' she replied, you would not talk in that 



way if you knew how clever he is and how unfortunate. 
Have you read his " Poems " ? ' Milnes took them 
away in bis pocket, and wrote to her next morning, 
' If your young friend would like a post in the Library 
of the British Museum, it shall be obtained for him, if 
only to induce you to forget what must have seemed 
my heartless flippancy. His book is the work of a true 
poet, and we must see that he never lacks butter for 
his bread.' " 

From the end of 1846 till the beginning of 
1866 Patmore worked steadily at the Museum, 
a diligent but not, from the librarian's point 
of view, a particularly able assistant. He 
could never, he used to say, resist the temp- 
tation to look into and taste the flavor of every 
book that passed through his hands ; and it is 
interesting to note that the net result of these 
tests was that at the end of his long term of 
service he reached the depressing conclusion 
that, of the forty miles of shelves in the 
Museum, forty feet would contain all the real 
literature of the world. How much of the 
forty miles of shelving was, in Patmore's opin- 
ion, devoted to conserving real rubbish we are 
left to conjecture. On his retirement in 1866 
Patmore was awarded a pension (of the cu- 
riously precise sum of .126, 13s. 4d. a year) 
which he drew until his death. 

The circumstances of Patmore's conversion 
to Roman Catholicism (1864) are not perhaps 
generally known, and would seem indeed to 
have been to some extent misrepresented, or 
misunderstood. That his formal change of 
creed was at least accelerated by his desire to 
remove the insuperable obstacle to his union 
with the lady who became his second wife, 
Mr. Champneys seems to admit. The notion 
that Patmore deliberately turned Catholic 
because he thought the lady in question (as 
Henry IV. thought Paris) " well worth a 
Mass," is of course as cruel as absurd, and 
that anyone could have broached it bears out 
Mr. Lecky's philosophical conclusion that there 
is much more pure malevolence in the world 
than people think. However, the facts in the 
case were as follows : In 1864 Patmore, still 
outwardly of the Anglican faith, journeyed to 
Rome where he made the acquaintance of a 
Miss Byles, an English convert to Romanism. 
Miss Byles was a woman of cultivation and 
some personal charm, who, as a girl, had been 
a pupil of Archdeacon (afterwards Cardinal) 
Manning, whose second wife it was believed 
with good reason she might in time have 
become. Any such prospect was of course 
brought to an end when Manning took orders 
in the Roman Church ; but his influence over 



1901.]

his pupil continued, and two years after his 
secession Miss Byles, to the consternation of 
her friends, followed the example (and probably 
the counsel) of her former preceptor. She 
used to relate afterwards with some humor, 
when the sting of the slights once put upon 
her by her antipapistical friends and relatives 
had disappeared, how an Anglican clergyman, 
calling at the house shortly after her conver- 
sion, refused for some time to notice her at all, 
until, on leaving, he kindly asked her " when 
she might be expected to turn Mohammedan ? " 

Patmore, then, met Miss Byles at Rome in 
1864, and it was she, we may conclude, who 
finally turned his footsteps, already wavering 
at the parting of the ways, into the path to the 
Vatican. Patmore records in his religious 
autobiography his early impression of his 
future wife : " I had never before," he says, 
" beheld so beautiful a personality, and this 
beauty seemed to be the pure effluence of the 
Catholic Sanctity." The pair were married 
in July, 1864 (a year after the death of Pat- 
more's first wife), at Bayswater, Cardinal 
Manning performing the ceremony, despite his 
disappointment at his fair convert's " sacrifice 
of her vocation," for Miss Byles, it seems, had 
contemplated taking the veil. Patmore's second 
wife, whose influence on his religious views 
and writings Mr. Champneys thinks was con- 
siderable, died some sixteen years after her 
marriage, and her place was promptly filled by 
Harriet Robson, the third " Angel in the 
House," for the " poet of nuptial love " tolerated 
no long break in his facilities for the imme- 
diate study of his chosen theme. 

Patmore's inbred mystical bent, and the 
completeness of his surrender to the primitive 
spirit of the old faith, are attested by his pil- 
grimages to Lourdes with two of his children, 
for whose bodily ailments he hoped for a mir- 
aculous cure at the shrine. For the partial 
blindness of one eye of his son Henry, in par- 
ticular, great things were hoped ; but, alas ! 
Our Lady of Lourdes proved no better than 
the London oculist, for the sight of the offend- 
ing eye was soon totally lost. Patmore wrote 
to his wife from Lourdes : 

"... We are offering our Masses for Henry and our 
hopes of him are increased by a miracle we were lucky 
enough to come in for yesterday. A peasant girl, with 
the most exquisite look of innocence and gratitude, had 
just come from the bath entirely cured of a paralysis 
of three years' standing. We had some talk with her 
and her mother as she was walking off with no touch 
of lameness, and the limb, which had been hitherto en- 
tirely insensible, restored to feeling and full strength. 



There could be no mistake about it. Rachel could not 
have acted the part." 

Patmore's faith in the virtues of the holy well 
was as entire as that of the Catholic students 
cited by Paul Bert, who, before presenting 
themselves for their examination for the " bac- 
calaureat," piously put drops of Lourdes water 
into their ink-bottles, in order that they might 
" pass " with distinction ; and his faith was in 
no wise shaken by the failure in his son's case 
of the mystic fluid as an eye-water. 

Mr. Champneys's first volume contains, be- 
sides the story of Patmore's life, separate chap- 
ters on his father, on each of his three wives, 
on his relations with Tennyson, and concludes 
with three chapters of personal recollections. 
In Volume II. Patmore's religious and philo- 
sophical opinions are rather elaborately dis- 
cussed in three chapters, and these are followed 
by the account Patmore wrote at the instance 
of his wife and a clerical friend, of his conver- 
sion to Romanism ; two-thirds of this volume 
are devoted to the letters, and regarding these 
we are of opinion that Mr. Champneys's rever- 
ence for great names has led him to include 
some writings that are hardly worth reprinting. 
But the correspondence on the whole is in- 
teresting, and the list of correspondents is 
imposing, including such names as Tennyson, 
Ruskin, Carlyle, Aubrey de Vere, Cardinals 
Manning and Newman, Holman Hunt, R. W. 
Emerson, Browning, etc. Carlyle's robust ex- 
pression of contempt for reviewers we are 
tempted to quote : 

" Unhappily the reviewer too is generally in the exact 
ratio of his readers, a dark blockhead with braggartism 
superadded; probably the supreme blockhead of block- 
heads, being a vocal one withal, and conscious of being 
wise. Him also we must leave to his fate: an inevitable 
phenomenon (' like people, like priest '), yet a transitory 
one, he too." 

But why, then, make so angry a coil over the 
doings of so small a creature ? 

Let us conclude our notice of these beauti- 
fully manufactured volumes with a verse of 
Patmore's written by him just after a great 
battle of the Franco-Prussian war, when Ger- 
man Te Deums were going up in thanksgiving 
to Him who was supposed to have presided 
over the slaughter of the French. Patmore 
used to call it " the most popular poem he ever 
wrote "; and our readers may discern in it a 
certain present appositeness : 

" This is to say, my dear Augusta, 
We ' ve had another awful buster : 
Ten thousand Frenchmen sent below ! 
Thank God from whom all blessings Sow ! "

MAJOR POND IN REMINISCENT MOOD.* 

For thirty-five years, Major James B. Pond 
has been the foremost lecture manager in this 
country. During that time he has managed 
practically all the famous men and women who 
have spoken from American platforms. Most 
of these have been his warm personal friends, 
and have written to him familiarly and charm- 
ingly. He has gathered many of their letters 
together and included them in a book entitled 
" Eccentricities of Genius," and we are given 
glimpses of their idiosyncrasies, their foibles, 
and their virtues, in a series of personal ob- 
servations and reminiscences. The wit, the 
wisdom, the anecdote, the talk of famous men 
and the talk about them, the strangeness and 
vivacity of many of the incidents, the singu- 
larity and eminence of the characters, combine 
to render his volume fascinating, interesting, 
and instructive. 

In speaking of the " lecture bureau," its 
sphere and its origin, he says : 

" The lyceum platform stands for ability, genius, 
education, reform, and entertainment. On it the greatest 
readers, orators, and thinkers have stood. On it reform 
has found her noblest advocates, literature her finest 
expression, progress her bravest pleaders, and humor 
its happiest translation. Some of the most gifted, most 
highly educated, and warmest-hearted men and women 
of the English-speaking race have in the last fifty years 
given their best efforts to the lyceum, and by their 
noble utterances have made its platform not only his- 
toric, but symbolic of talent, education, and genius. 
Until the Redpath Lyceum Bureau was founded by 
James Redpath in Boston, in 1867, lecture committees 
were in the habit' of applying to lecturers and readers 
direct. These committees were usually made up from 
the leading citizens of the town, with a view to securing 
the services of the ablest men and women of letters 
for the entertainment of the public. The fee was gen- 
erally nominal, but sufficient to cover the actual ex- 
penses of the star and furnish a small honorarium." 

Among those who were brought before the 
public under these early conditions were Ed- 
ward Everett, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John 
B. Gough, Wendell Phillips, George William 
Curtis, James Russell Lowell, Edward Everett 
Hale, Bayard Taylor, Henry Ward Beecher, 
Julia Ward Howe, Susan B. Anthony, Anna 
E. Dickinson, and Mary A. Livermore. The 
four great readers who could attract attention 
year after year were George Vandenhoff and 
James E. Murdoch famous Shakespearean 
actors of the day Professor Churchill of 
Andover, and Charlotte Cushman. Mr. Shil- 
laber ("Mrs. Partington " ) as a humorous

lecturer was also very popular. Major Pond 
notes the change that has come over the spirit 
of " the lecture course " during later years. 
Given at first to discussions of the leading 
issues of the day, the demand then was for 
entertainment by traveller and humorist, bring- 
ing us to the present, in which audiences are 
demanding the presence of the best in the lit- 
erary and scientific world, and the story of 
great exploits or discoveries. 

Major Pond admits that he " drifted " into 
the lyceum business. It was while associated 
with the "Salt Lake Tribune" the first 
Gentile paper in Utah that he became ac- 
quainted with Mrs. Ann Eliza Young. This 
was shortly after she apostatized. One evening 
it was arranged that she should tell the story 
of her life to the guests of the Walker House, 
where she had taken refuge under the protec- 
tion of the officials of the territory Governor 
Woods and Chief Justice McKean. She told 
her story one of the most interesting and 
thrilling ever rehearsed. Her speech was 
telegraphed to the Associated Press, and the 
next day she received many telegrams from 
various persons asking her to lecture. One 
was from P. T. Barnum, and another from 
James Redpath. It was conceived that if she 
could tell her story in Washington, the state 
of Utah, instead of being neglected as it was, 
would get some attention and legislation. 
Major Pond proposed a lecture tour, and she 
accepted ; it was then that he undertook his 
first managerial contract. Two days later she 
did tell her story in Washington. Forty-eight 
hours afterwards the Poland bill for the relief 
of the oppressed in Utah was a law. 

It is not surprising to learn that the great 
triumvirate of lecture kings consisted of John 
B. Gough, Henry Ward Beecher, and Wendell 
Phillips. 

" Gough was one of the heroes of the nineteenth 
century. The incalculable good he did his fellow men 
can never be known. It is no idle statement when we 
say that he was the direct means, under God, of raising 
tens of thousands from degradation. . . . He was a 
charming man personally modest, unassuming, kind- 
hearted, and sincere." 

Wendell Phillips is accredited with being the 
most polished and graceful orator our country 
has ever known. The author's recollections 
of Beecher extend over many pages. 

" He had, as I can bear witness, the power of ab- 
straction by which he could put away all thoughts of 
care and trouble, and rise to a higher atmosphere where 
the heavens were unclouded, while his eyes and ears 
were closed to all lower considerations. To those 
nearest to him at these times this power seemed almost

superhuman. ... I remember saying to him one day, 
after I had seen him walking arm in arm with a man 
who had injured him, who had been abusing him, < I 
think you are carrying the doctrine of forgiveness too 
far.' He said: 'Pond, can we go farther than to bless 
those who curse us, and pray for those who despitefnlly 
use us? Ah, there is so little known of the spirit of Christ 
in the world that when a man is trying feebly and afar 
to follow Him even Christians do not understand it.' " 

Emerson called Charles Sumner " the 
whitest soul I ever knew." Men of whom 
such remarks may be made with absolute truth 
are rare in the public life of any .nation, and 
their careers should be kept prominently before 
each rising generation. But Sumner's faults 
of character are as well known as his public 
services he was unconciliating, egotistic, and 
dogmatic. Major Pond and his father were 
once on the same train with the " aristocrat." 
He was reading in the drawing-room car. 

" Father stepped up and said : ' The Honorable 
Charles Sumner? I have read all of your speeches. I 
feel that it is the duty of every American to take you 
by the hand. This is my son he has just returned 
from the Kansas conflict.' Honorable Charles Sumner 
did not see father nor his son, but he saw the porter 
and said : ' Can you get me a place where I will be undis- 
turbed ? ' Poor father! His heart was almost broken." 

The author's estimate of " Mark Twain " is 
lengthy, and naturally commendatory. Suffice 
to say that he considers him one of the greatest 
geniuses of our time, and as great a philosopher 
as humorist. The " eccentricities " of " Max 
O'Rell" he found unenjoyable. The history 
of professional humorists shows that they have 
turned their bright side to the world, have 
laughed and joked, and have so bubbled over 
with humor that they seem to have no serious 
side all this with a background of physical 
disease, or a personal sorrow, that made mental 
depression inevitable. " Bill Nye " kept alive 
his quaint humor in the face of bodily disabil- 
ity under which men of less courage would 
have succumbed at once. 

There is a pathetic strain in the account of 
Ralph Waldo Emerson's last appearance on the 
platform. A lecture was given to raise funds 
to save the Old South Church from being torn 
down. The venerable author faced as choice 
an audience of the blue blood of Boston as 
has ever assembled in that old chapel. 

" Mr. Emerson was introduced. As he began read- 
ing his lecture the audience was very attentive. After a 
few moments he lost his place, and his grand-daughter, 
sitting in the front row of seats, gently stepped toward 
him and reminded him that he was lecturing. He saw 
at once that he was wandering, and with a most charm- 
ing, characteristic, apologetic bow he resumed his place 
an incident that seemed to affect the audience more 
than anything else that could have occurred. A few 



moments later he took a piece of manuscript in his 
hand, and, turning around with it, laid it on a side 
table. Just then one of the audience said to me (I 
think it was Mrs. Livermore or Mrs. Howe), ' Please 
have the audience pass right out.' He had probably 
been speaking about fifteen minutes. The audience 
passed out, many of them in tears. I never read any 
account of it in the newspapers. I suppose it was out 
of love and veneration for the dear man that the inci- 
dent did not receive public mention, but there must be 
a great many still alive who were witnesses to that 
memorable scene." 

Mr. Israel Zangwill was one of the unique 
characters whom Manager Pond introduced to 
American audiences. He speaks of Mr. 
Zangwill's " indomitable assurance," adding : 
" Whatever he said was so because he said so, 
although I knew better at the time." Three 
pages are devoted to Mr. Hall Caine, who was 
greatly disappointed at his lack of success in 
America as author-reader. Zangwill and Caine, 
both smarting at their treatment by the New 
York papers, breakfasting together at the 
Waldorf, were " so chopfallen and dejected 
that they might have put pepper in their cof- 
fee instead of sugar without knowing the dif- 
ference." " Ian Maclaren " was as much 
surprised at his audiences as Mr. Caine was 
disappointed. 

Sir Edwin Arnold was also surprised at the 
welcome tendered him in this country. Ameri- 
can audiences were amazed at the poet-editor's 
retentive memory. 

" One evening in my library Sir Edwin was reclining 
on a lounge. I was holding a rare volume of Shake- 
speare, which he had been admiring and had passed to 
me. ' Now, Major,' he said, ' give me the first line 
from any scene and I'll give you the whole scene.' I 
gave him a line from the least-known of the plays and, 
to my astonishment, he recited the entire scene. He 
told me afterward that he could recite Shakespeare 
from beginning to end." 

Speaking of the passage of our international 
copyright law, Sir Edwin humorously said : 
" Personally I was never a fanatic in the matter. I 
have always rather had a tenderness for those buc- 
caneers of the ocean of books who, in nefarious bottoms, 
carried my poetical goods far and wide without any 
charge for freight." 

It is impossible to do more than merely 
point out the sphere of the book under con- 
sideration. Upwards of a hundred persons 
all well known names in the world of science, 
literature, art, and theology are here treated 
in a gossipy, reminiscent manner. The author 
does not claim to be more than a story-teller, 
and his book is not more nor less than what 
he claims it to be. A little more indulgent 
appreciation of the right word in the right 
place would have added to the literary quality

of the work ; but his veneration for the " aris- 
tocracy of genius " overbalances his respect for 
mere words. He has a keen sense of humor 
it is not every man who can carry a bon mot, 
and probably no man carries witticisms cor- 
rectly who has not himself a full comprehension 
of their point. In addition to this, his per- 
ception of character is acute, and he possesses 
the rare faculty of being able to single out traits 
which are peculiar to each person. It is not 
hard to read between the lines, that dealings 
with celebrities are not always as agreeable as 
might be hoped. Yet, in spite of the cases 
where bis subjects have been imbued with an 
exaggerated idea of their own greatness, Major 
Pond could hardly hesitate in saying, as Bos- 
well said to Lord Chatham : " I have the 
happiness of being capable to contemplate with 
supreme delight those distinguished spirits by 
which God is sometimes pleased to honor 
humanity." INGRAM A. PYLE. 



THEODORE PARKER AND HIS TIMES.* 

Another biography of Theodore Parker is 
welcome. Weiss's bulky and " chaotic " work, 
which appeared in 1864, was written too soon 
after the stormy life it portrayed had come to 
a close. It was, moreover, the work of one 
who was too much of a partisan of its hero. 
Yet withal it is a wonderfully interesting book ; 
we know an Episcopal clergyman who has read 
it three times. Dr. Frothingham, on the other 
hand, was in his earlier years a sympathizer 
with Parker's theological opponents, a fact 
which could hardly fail to leave its effect on 
even hismaturer judgment of the great preacher 
though Mr. Chadwick believes this effect 
was slight. The other biographies Seville's, 
Dean's, Altherr's, and the rest are either not 
readily accessible or not of prime importance. 
Mr. Chadwick, then, had the opportunity of 
producing a really desirable and timely book. 

Mr. Chadwick is, moreover, well qualified to 
write the story of Theodore Parker's life. He 
enjoyed a personal acquaintance with Parker 
and the members of the circle in which Parker 
lived. He is familiar with Parker's system of 
thought and its relation to the speculation of 
Parker's time in America and abroad ; he is 
fully in sympathy with the creed of Parker, at 
the same time appreciating the point of view 
of those whose opinions differed from Parker's

John White Chadwick. Boston : Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 



excessively radical views. He possesses rare lit- 
erary gifts, especially in the field of biography. 
Naturally, then, we expect from him an ac- 
curate and vivid picture, if only in outline, of 
Theodore Parker and his times ; and such the 
book proves to be. The author has set himself 
the difficult task of compressing the story of 
Theodore Parker's life, for which Weiss (in- 
cluding, however, much correspondence) re- 
quired a thousand pages and Frothingham 
nearly six hundred, into four hundred small 
pages. He would have preferred, he says, to 
make a book even larger than Weiss's, draw- 
ing freely from Parker's works and correspond- 
ence ; or, within the limits of a work like the 
present, to introduce a more largely autobio- 
graphical element. But he has wisely refrained 
from either course. To our generation, the 
present book will be more really serviceable. 
In these pages Theodore Parker lives again 
^scholar and teacher, minister, heretic, theo- 
logian, leader of the enemies of slavery. The 
proportion of the book is good. We do not 
complain that Mr. Chadwick has laid too much 
stress on the side of the preacher, for we do 
not think he has. Parker, with all his multi- 
farious reading, book-reviewing, lecturing, and 
fighting of slavery, was first and last and always 
a preacher, with the sermonizing habit so firmly 
rooted that he could never shake it off. He felt 
" born for a pulpit if for anything." His othe*r 
activities, however, were marvellously diverse ; 
and these Mr. Chadwick has clearly set forth. 
In summing up Parker's traits and defining 
his present position in the public estimation, 
Mr. Chadwick differs from Frothingham con- 
cerning Parker's lack of " the atmosphere of 
devout feeling." The explanation of this lack 
Mr. Chadwick finds not in the predominance 
of Parker's intellectual power over his religious 
sensibility, he thinks Parker's religious sen- 
sibility was much greater than his intellectual 
power, but rather in his " exaggeration of 
Martineau's conspicuous defect, that of looking 
for the significance of religion too rigidly to 
its intellectual contents." He agrees with 
Frothingham, however, in calling Parker "the 
grandest theist of the time." Concerning 
Parker's philosophical and theological position, 
Mr. Chadwick, writing a quarter of a century 
later, naturally goes further than Frothingham, 
for in that interim great changes have come 
about, so great as to " make Parker's hetero- 
doxy seem antiquated, almost absurd, ortho- 
doxy." With skill he points out how much fur- 
ther orthodox critics have now gone than Parker

thought of going, and how Parker's doctrine 
of ' the divine immanence in matter and in 
man " is now held by most Christian thinkers. 

But great as was the preacher in Parker, 
the humanitarian was greater. He is remem- 
bered to-day not so much by his sermons, now 
little read, as by his devotion to discouraged, 
doubting, and downtrodden humanity. The 
call to aid a fugitive slave was put above 
everything else. He must follow the flag of 
humanity. And to this part of the story Mr. 
Chadwick does full justice. The life of the 
anti-slavery leader and of the pastor of ten 
thousand souls, from Boston to Calcutta, he 
recounts vividly. 

The make-up of the book is good. Some 
minor corrections have already appeared in 
print ; in addition we may note (p. xix.) that 
the " National Review " article of 1860, which 
has been ascribed to James Martineau, ap- 
peared in volume x ; and (p. xiv.) that the 
discourse on Daniel Webster was not published 
till 1853. The bibliography is fairly full. 
References to Allibone and Poole for sup- 
plementary titles might have been added 
(cp. p. 379) ; and why confine the list to 
English books ? Mr. Chadwick was of course 
aware of Altherr's careful study (Theodor 
Parker in seinem Leben und Wirken darge- 
stellt, St. Gallen, 1894 ; see an appreciative 
review by M. Picard in Revue de IMstoire 
des religions xxx. 224227), and of the earlier 
and briefer work by H. Lang (Theodor 
Parker, Zurich, about 1880). The list might 
also have properly included Ziethen's transla- 
tion of some of Parker's works into German 
(five vols., Leipzig, 1854-61). But these are 
minor points. A good index makes the book 
doubly valuable.

The third volume of Hastings's " Dictionary

standard of the monumental work. While it 
would hardly be true to say that its subjects 
are more important than those of Volume II., 
a book must be of first importance that treats, 
among other subjects, of Matthew, Mark, Luke, 
the Old and New Testament canons, Paul the 
Apostle, Law, Moses, Numbers, Mediator,

Miracle, Peter, Epistles of Peter, Passover, 
and Pharisees. 

The point of view of the authors of the 
articles in this volume is that of historical crit- 
icism, although in the case of certain contrib- 
utors there is to be seen a somewhat unexpected 
disregard of what has come to be accepted as 
probability. Yet even in so conservative an 
article as that of Dr. M'Clymont upon the 
New Testament, critical results are by no 
means disregarded. As a whole, the articles 
are of exceptional value, although one's pat- 
riotism leads one to feel that more work might 
well have been assigned to American scholars. 
It must be said, too, that some of the articles 
upon the New Testament are disappointing, 
and hardly of the same grade as those dealing 
with similar subjects in the Old Testament. 
That upon the New Testament Canon, for in- 
stance, is hardly more than a somewhat mod- 
ernized epitome of Westcott, a discussion 
of the external evidence of different books, 
which all but ignores the weighty matters of 
local, partial, and heretical canons, as well as 
the motives and causes leading to the final 
adoption of the canon in its present form. 
Similarly, the article upon the Messiah, al- 
though sufficient for the general reader, will 
disappoint the special student. Altogether 
admirable, however, are the articles of Pro- 
fessor Chase upon the Epistles of Peter, that 
upon the Second Epistle being a model of 
method and investigation. Professor Findlay 
has done characteristically careful work upon 
Paul the Apostle. Here again we have an 
illustration of the conservative progress of 
English New Testament scholars. Professor 
Findlay favors Lightfoot's view of Paul's 
" thorn in the flesh " as epilepsy, and holds 
to the second imprisonment of the Apostle, as 
well as the older chronological scheme of his 
life, while adopting the South Galatian theory 
of Ramsay. It is to be regretted that in its 
exposition of the Pauline thought the treat- 
ment should have been so much more system- 
atic than historical. Of the two articles by 
Dr. Fairweather upon the Maccabees, that 
upon the history of the family is hardly more 
than a brief statement of external events, and 
all but overlooks the great movements of 
thought and religion that characterized their 
epoch. Professor Kennedy has produced a 
most valuable study upon the money of the 
Bible, in which he follows the trend of recent 
numismatic work in refusing to accept any coin 
of the Maccabees earlier than John Hyrcanus.

An equally valuable article is that of Professor 
McAllister upon Medicine. 

It is, however, quite impossible and almost 
impertinent to pass these ex cathedra judgments 
upon such serious and scholarly work as is 
contained in this volume. It would perhaps 
be better, in a short review, to be content 
with congratulating the general editor of the 
Dictionary, Dr. James Hastings, for his suc- 
cess, not alone in his selection of contributors, 
but also in the almost uniform justice with 
which the space is distributed. His work, 
representing as it does both caution and inde- 
pendence in the use of scientific methods in 
biblical study, is certain to have a permanent 
place and influence in the rapid development 
of a rational theology.

THE HINGE OF THE WORLD'S FUTURE.* 

The criticism of Mr. Chester Holcombe in " The 
Real Chinese Question" applies to nearly all of 
the books dealing with the weighty problem on 
which the future of the entire world may be said to 
hinge. Not the welfare of the Chinese, but that of 
the various nations of Christendom clamoring at 
the gates of the ancient empire, is the subject of 
their consideration. The talk is all of reparation 
and indemnity from the Chinese, with never the 
hint of a suggestion of indemnity or reparation to 
them for the wholesale atrocities visited upon them 
by the Allied forces. For the most part every 
author assumes that the European or American 
point of view, or the point of view of some one of 
the Christian sects, is the only one from which the 
present emergency can be grasped ; that the Chi- 
nese, even in their own country, are strange and 
inhuman, and that the solution of their problems 
lies with the statesmen of Christendom, to whom

plenipotentiary power must be granted. The very 
remedies proposed show the Caucasian to be a man 
of like passions with his yellow-skinned congener, 
and Shylock's outburst and plea for a common hu- 
manity comes into mind with every fresh revelation 
of the wish to place all the moral responsibility 
upon Chinese shoulders as a preliminary to doing 
something, ostensibly for his own good, but really 
for the good of his advisers. 

The book of M. Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu, "The 
Awakening of the East," is an honorable exception 
to this. Mr. Henry Norman writes an introduction 
for it, saying rightly that the three countries treated 
in the work, Siberia, Japan, and China, are those 
concerning which enlightenment is needed before 
the question of China alone can be discussed at all. 
The author is a Frenchman, and has travelled 
through the lands he describes. He gives us not 
only an account of the position of Russia, which 
seems to be less advantageous than Great Britain 
has generally been disposed to think, but a sympa- 
thetic survey of the advance of Japan, and an illu- 
minating comparison of Japan's condition forty 
years ago with that of China to-day. Other writers 
have seen in the laying off of one culture and the 
assumption of another, by the people of the Mikado, 
an evidence of instability and lack of moral convic- 
tion. With more insight, our author holds that 
Japan was touched at heart not at all by the Chinese 
civilization she is so rapidly discarding, and not 
much by the European garments in which she is 
clothing herself, her own national life lying calm 
and undisturbed below them all ; that it is the depth 
of this life, not its shallowness, which enables the 
astonishing change to be made. In China, on the 
other hand, the civilization of the people is the 
people itself, and a change is inconceivable except 
as a preliminary to national suicide. In Japan, too, 
the nation worked out its own salvation ; in China, 
a multitude of self-constituted counsellors are stand- 
ing about suggesting or dictating safety for them- 
selves. He sees in England, Japan, and the United 
States the only honest advocates of an open-door 
policy, and his advice to his countrymen is to secure 
for Europe in China such commercial concessions 
as have been wrested from Turkey. 

Captain Mahan is an excellent illustration of the 
writer whose only thought is one of enlightened 
selfishness ; and it is doubtful if a line in his " Prob- 
lem of Asia " has the good of the Chinese nation at 
heart, except in so far as unhappiness in that coun- 
try conduces to unhappiness for Christendom or to 
Christian disadvantage. " The propriety of non- 
interference," or " the conventional rights of a so- 
called independent state to regulate its own internal 
affairs," are outworn phantasies with him when 
Chinese affairs are under discussion. His advice, 
then, would be to prevent a preponderance of influ- 
ence in the East < s n the part of any one of the 
Powers, and to secure an open door, not in the 
commercial sense alone, but for the importation of 
our civilization, lest China, waxing fat under in-

creased trade, shall not at the same time acquire 
" the corrective and elevating element of the higher 
ideals, which in Europe have made good their con- 
trolling influence over mere physical might " (using 
his own words). This is delicious : is it America 
in the Philippines, England in South Africa, Russia 
in Manchuria, France in Madagascar, or Germany 
in Liao-Tong, which is to set China the example of 
non-aggression a policy which has been Chinese 
since Egypt built the pyramids, and one to which 
her fabulous extent of national existence is unques- 
tionably due. For the United States, our man of 
war would have us " respect to the utmost the integ- 
rity of Chinese territory, and the individuality of 
the Chinese character in shaping its own govern- 
ment and polity," only " meddling" (his own word) 
with their national affairs when "they become in- 
ternationally unendurable." Poor China! 

The Reverend Doctor Condit's book, ' The China- 
man as We See Him," says little about the Mon- 
golian race in its own country, and a great deal 
concerning its conduct in America, particularly in 
San Francisco, where he has been laboring among 
the Chinese for years. Yet it deserves careful study 
by those who are shaping our national destinies. It 
proves by absolute demonstration that there are 
more points of resemblance than of difference be- 
tween the white and the yellow races ; and it holds 
up to view, with unsparing hand, the vices of the 
American and his government beside those of his 
Eastern brother. Especially significant, in view of 
what is to follow, is the denunciation of the British 
Opium War, and the consequent degradation of the 
pagan by the Christian nation. Few defenders of 
that atrocity are to be found to-day ; but Doctor 
Condit points out the damning fact that the English 
now have an annual revenue of forty millions of 
dollars from this international crime one which 
is beginning to react upon America in the spread 
of the opium habit among us. 

Mr. Joseph Walton's " China and the Present 
Crisis " is based upon observations made during 
eight months of travel in Japan, Corea, and China, 
during which time five thousand miles were passed 
over in the interior of the last-named country. It 
contains a summary of his knowledge delivered 
before the House of Commons on March 30 last, 
and follows this with a chapter dealing with more 
recent events, in which certain suggestions are 
made for a betterment of the situation. These 
suggestions are four in number, comprising a grant 
to the Chinese government to levy increased duties 
on imports, but only on these conditions (how long 
would the United States permit the outside world 
to dictate its tariff laws ?) : all other taxes on goods 
to be abolished, and a substantial share of the in- 
creased revenues to be given the provincial govern- 
ments ; all officials to be adequately paid ; all inland 
waterways in China to be opened to the world's 
commerce ; and all railways built with foreign 
capital to become the property of the Chinese gov- 
ernment upon due compensation being granted. 



These conditions are not wholly selfish, in the 
sense in which the Chinese will not profit by them 
at all ; but it is to be remarked that nothing but 
good will flow from them to Great Britain, while 
the assumption by foreigners of the inland com- 
merce of China would throw many millions of 
Chinese into starvation. 

To a great extent, the interest of Mr. William 
Barclay Parsons's " An American Engineer in 
China " lies in the account therein given of an ex- 
tended professional journey through Hu-nan, a 
practically unknown province of the empire. This 
expedition was undertaken as the result of an 
American concession for constructing a railway 
from Hankow to Canton, nine hundred miles, which, 
with the mining and other privileges appertain- 
ing, make it, in value and in national importance, 
second to no other concession granted by the 
Chinese Government." Four hundred miles of its 
line are to be contained within the " closed " prov- 
ince of Hu-nan, traversing its entire length, so that 
during more than half the author's tour he was the 
first white man ever seen by the resident natives. 
Three other men of European blood had been in the 
province, but only on its waterways ; and the in- 
formation given by Mr. Parsons is of real import- 
ance. The expedition was accompanied by soldiers, 
and was made at some little personal risk, more 
from the childish curiosity of the natives, however, 
than from any ill will. Mr. Parsons remarks that 
our country has the confidence of the Chinese to 
an extent unknown by other nations, because of its 
supposed freedom from international greed ; and 
this he thinks is worth retaining, on the principle 
that honesty is the best policy." Chapters deal- 
ing popularly with professional subjects, like archi- 
tectural and railway engineering, add to the value 
of the book, which is well illustrated. 

"The Outbreak in China " is due, as the Reverend 
Doctor Pott analyses the situation, to a round 
dozen of causes. Among these are listed the Ger- 
man seizure of Kiao-chao Bay, the forced lease to 
Russia of Port Arthur, the forced lease to England 
of Wei-hai-wei and the extension at Kowloon, the 
Italian demand for Sanmen Bay, the general ex- 
tension of the foreign settlements, the introduction 
of railways, the forced concessions to foreigners, 
the subsidizing of Chinese by foreign capital, and 
" missionary enterprise." These provoking causes, 
with others which come from the Chinese, are dis- 
cussed in detail and remedies are suggested. The 
reverend Doctor advises that " wherever there have 
been anti-foreign uprisings, punitive expeditions 
should penetrate, and the guilty, responsible for 
the massacre of innocent women and children, be 
made to pay the penalty for their barbarous cruelty. 
The arrogance and self-conceit of ages must be 
trailed in the dust." Doctor Pott advances argu- 
ments for and against a partition of Chinese terri- 
tory after China has been properly humiliated 
but nothing distantly resembling a moral concept 
can be discerned; he expresses the conviction that 



46

Russia, France, and Germany will continue their 
present aggressions ; and advises America to re- 
member that her part should " not he merely further 
laud-grabbing, or the increase of commerce, hut 
the advancement of Christian civilization in the 
Far East." 

Mr. Alexis Krausse, in spite of his un-English 
name, presents the case of Great Britain in " The 
Story of the Chinese Crisis," leading up to the 
present status by a justification of the Opium War, 
and setting forth the two serious mistakes of the 
British foreign office in dealing with China as lying 
in the seizure of Fort Arthur by Russia without 
effective protest, and the assumption of the throne 
by the Dowager Empress. He calls attention, as 
Mr. Walton did also, to the patent fact that the 
interests of the British in China are of vastly more 
consequence than those in South Africa, and that 
present preoccupation with the sturdy burghers is 
likely to result in a tremendous future loss in the 
East presumably a part of the price which Presi- 
dent Krueger said England would have to pay for 
South African subjugation. 

" The Story of China," by Mr. Neville P. Ed- 
wards, seems intended for the consumption of 
British jingoes exclusively. It deals with the 
question in a flippant and heartless way, setting 
forth the history of England in China with little 
regard to the facts involved, and displaying no 
capacity for dealing with the weighty problems of 
the hour. It is plentifully illustrated. 

The republication, after thirty-four years, of Mr. 
Freeman-Mitford's "The Attache' at Peking" is 
important for the curious proof it affords that his- 
tory repeats itself, and quite as much so for the 
preface just added to the book, which contains all 
the suggestions of experience and a point of view 
that is quite the author's own. He justifies the 
use of opium in a pipe, and quotes authorities in 
proof of its harmlessness ; he sets forth the virtues 
of the Jesuit missionaries in China with rare dis- 
passion ; and he proposes, as one step toward a 
settlement, that the capital be removed to Nanking, 
which enjoyed that honor during the fifteenth cen- 
tury. The entire book is informing and readable ; 
but the flying bats printed in gold upon its covers 
are a poor symbol of its general freedom from 
prejudice. 

For an American reader, the most informing and 
satisfactory work of all is Mr. Chester Holcombe's 
"The Real Chinese Question." The author has 
had thirty years' experience in the Empire, half of 
it spent in an official connection with the American 
Legation at Peking and half in furthering various 
financial and commercial projects among the 
Chinese. Strange to say, after this wide experience 
he rather admires the people instead of hating 
them, and his book comes nearer disinterestedness 
than any of its fellows. The one important ques- 
tion before the world to-day in respect of China, he 
believes, is the conservation of the integrity of the 
Chinese government, a position in which he coin- 



cides with Sir Robert Hart's recently expressed 
views. To this end he proposes three reforms, 
which seem to possess a degree of practicality that 
is absent from most other suggestions. He would 
(first) have an imperial standard of weights and 
measures enforced by the Chinese themselves, pre- 
sumably as a step toward securing justice in 
(secondly) paying the Chinese officials an adequate 
salary with consequent inhibition of existing schemes 
for extortion, followed (thirdly) by denying official 
position to all persons found to be addicted to the 
opium habit, holding here, with Doctor Condit, 
that the opium-user is certain to become a moral 
alien, unable to distinguish between right and 
wrong. Throughout his interesting work, Mr. 
Holcombe never loses sight of the Chinese point of 
view, and has no hesitancy in laying bare to his 
readers' gaze some of the numerous infamies which 
Christian governments and their people have prac- 
tised upon the government and people of the 
Flowery Kingdom. 

Yet, at best, the ten books here reviewed leave 
little hope of a future which will make for the 
world's peace or for the continued prosperity of 
the Caucasian race as the conservator of high 
ethical ideals. Might, not right, sits in the high 
places, and the possible adoption by peaceful China 
of the militarism of Europe and the " land hunger " 
of America is indeed a "Yellow Peril" whose 
menace no one may now foretell.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Mr - Julian Corbett's study of the 
Tudor navy is brought to a close in a 
naval hittory. work Qn The Successors of Drake " 

(Longmans). This volume carries the reader 
through the period of hostilities with Spain which 
extended from the death of Drake in 1596 to the 
conclusion of the war at the accession of James I. 
For the most part, political histories of England do 
not expand the events of these years ; for with the 
defeat of the Armada the British navy achieved its 
greatest glory and is supposed to have crushed 
Spanish sea-power. With Drake's disappearance 
from the stage, much of the picturesque in English 
naval action is lost. Mr. Corbett's more thorough 
examination into the history of this period leads 
him to believe that the famous sea-fight, far from 
being a crowning victory, was but a prelude to 
more serious contests, and that it required ten more 
years to so strengthen the British navy that Philip 
would admit his inability to crush England. The 
dying Spanish king advised his son to make peace, 
but both king and nation were reluctant, and with 
the final peace Spain yielded nothing of the West 
Indian trade. These years were years of change 
and great development in maritime methods. The 
dash and recklessness of the earlier leaders, their 
strange mixture of puritanism and piracy, gave 



1901.]

way to a business-like system of making war for 
df finite objects. Technical knowledge came to be 
regarded as essential for the command of ships. 
The result was ultimately a navy more powerful 
than any Spain could produce, acknowledging but 
one rival, the Dutch. Thus, while the romance of 
war departed with Drake, it was in the years that 
followed that a permanent British sea-power was 
created. History, says Mr. Corbett, has not justly 
appreciated the importance of this latter period. 
Still, the present volume treats of some characters 
and episodes surely picturesque, if not heroic. Essex 
and Raleigh strove to emulate the brilliant exploits 
of Drake and Hawkins, and in the capture of Cadiz 
came near the maik. Essex, indeed, until political 
intrigue had sapped his influence and exhausted his 
patience, is presented as a man of unusual attain- 
ments, and one unfairly treated by historians. 
Raleigh, on the other hand, has been over-estimated 
by writers. Secure in the Queen's favor, important 
commands were given him ; and these, together 
with his charming writings, served to give him an 
undeserved reputation for naval wisdom. That men 
of the Elizabethan period were fully conscious of 
the power of the press, is seen in the fact that both 
Essex and Raleigh, upon the capture of Cadiz, sent 
off post-haste to London a private messenger with 
a full account of the exploit, written for personal 
glory. Each hero wished to rush into print; but 
the shrewd Cecil captured and suppressed both 
messages, and issued only the official account of 
Lord Howard. Mr. Corbett has produced a schol- 
arly work. Research and discrimination are evident 
throughout. Extreme detail prohibits popularity in 
a sense, as does also the necessarily technical char- 
acter of much of the work ; yet there are many 
pages of brilliant description and of illuminating 
analysis. 

" The Builders of Greater Britain " 
8erie8 (Longman) is brought to a 
conclusion in the publication of a 
volume on Sir Stamford Raffles by Mr. Hugh E. 
Egerton. The book is unmistakably the best of the 
series in literary workmanship and in biographical 
style, though not in intrinsic interest. Sir Stamford 
Raffles was a poor boy who, by sheer hard work, 
fought his way up to a position of confidence in the 
home office of the East India Company. In 1805 
he was sent to Prince of Wales Island, and sub- 
sequently served in Java, Sumatra, and Singapore, 
in important capacities. He was responsible for 
the English exploitation of Singapore as a check 
upon Dutch influence in the East, and it is mainly 
for this service that he is included in the present 
series. Yet this was not his only claim upon public 
recognition, for he was endowed in an unusual 
degree with the qualities which have created British 
empire. He was hampered by instructions from 
England, yet, assuming the independence to act 
and to refer afterwards, he succeeded in executing 
his own designs without coming into immediate 



collision with the home office. Fortunately for 
England, Raffles was but one of a host of agents 
who, overstepping the limits set by central authority, 
effected permanent improvement and expansion. 
Mr. Egerton asserts that Raffles was a conscious 
philanthropic expansionist, that a desire to better 
native conditions went hand in hand with business 
administration, and that his term of office was 
marked by decided improvement in native life. 
This actual betterment was undeniably achieved ; 
nevertheless it is not difficult to see that to Raffles's 
mind England's foreign power, the Company's 
finances, and native improvement, held importance 
in the order stated. Nor did he disdain to use all the 
accustomed methods of doubtful intrigue to secure 
the submission of native princes. Thus after a 
successful war, begun in intrigue, he wrote : A 
population of not less than a million has been 
wrested from the tyranny and oppression of an in- 
dependent, ignorant, and cruel Prince, and a country 
yielding to none on earth in fertility and cultivation, 
affording a revenue of not less than a million of 
Spanish dollars in the year, placed at our disposal." 
Raffles was never idle ; he worked hard, aged early, 
and died in retirement in England at forty-six, 
July 5, 1826. He is an excellent illustration of 
the energetic colonial administrator, honest and 
upright in his motives, and in action as humane as 
to him the circumstances warranted.

forcible plea for a body of men who deserve excep- 
tionally well of their country, the little book wherein 
General George A. Forsyth, a gallant soldier and 
an attractive, virile writer, tells " The Story of the 
Soldier" (Appleton). General Forsyth's story of 
the growth as an establishment of the army, and of 
its more signal exploits in the field, is necessarily 
an outline sketch, but it is graphic, vigorously 
drawn, and based on wide experience. Its aim is 
to give the reader a correct idea of the soldier of 
the United States army as he really is. The vol- 
ume opens with an account of the inception of the 
army, its raison d'etre, and the sources whence its 
officers are commissioned. A chapter is devoted to 
the characteristics and development of the soldier 
his surroundings, perquisites, and pay. To read- 
ers with a taste for adventure the chapters on the 
various campaigns in our chronic Indian wars will 
prove satisfying. There are a half-dozen striking 
illustrations by Mr. R. F. Zogbanm. The pen of 
General Forsyth and the pencil of Mr. Zogbaum

are again interestingly in evidence in the volume 
containing four stories of personal experiences in 
Indian Warfare and in the Civil War, and entitled 
"Thrilling Days in Army Life" (Harper). The 
titles are: "A Frontier Fight"; "An Apache 
Raid "; " Sheridan's Ride "; " The Closing Scene 
at Appomattox Court-House." The title of the 
book does not belie the contents. The stories are 
" thrilling " enough, and they are the better for be- 
ing so modestly and directly told. The book has 
the sharp literalism of the account of an eye- 
witness ; and its quality is not impaired by any 
straining at rhetorical effect. Mr. Zogbaum's pic- 
tures are decidedly good in their way, and there 
are sixteen of them. 

No one is familiar with the history 
of the Tennyson family, or, more 
specifically, with the " Memoirs " 
prepared by the second Lord Tennyson, without 
being aware of the intimacy between that distin- 
guished group and the family of the Reverend H. 
D. Rawnsley. " Memories of the Tennysons " 
(Macmillan), from the hand of the honorary Canon 
of Carlisle, will therefore be welcomed as tending 
to cast new light on the individualities of the most 
distinguished band of brothers in English literature. 
The chief concern of the author is, of course, with 
Alfred Tennyson, and many interesting anecdotes 
are given, none of them disclosing any unsuspected 
traits of a man so fully contemporaneous and so 
fortunate in his biographies, yet all rounding out 
toward completeness our knowledge of that com- 
manding personality. The incidents are set forth 
with great good nature and entire frankness, in- 
cluding some corrections of Mr. Rawnsley's speech 
by the Laureate, as when he insisted upon the 
pronunciation of " knowledge " with the " o " as in 
" know " an eccentricity of speech due, like many 
others, to his northern English origin. A chapter 
not less interesting than the others is devoted to 
Charles Tennyson Turner ; while the book is pre- 
faced by a series of homely anecdotes rescued from 
servants and villagers who knew the Tennysons of 
old. An interesting photograph of Alfred Tenny- 
son has been reproduced for the frontispiece, and 
the charm of the Reverend Mr. Rawnsley's style 
makes the book a contribution to literature in more 

senses than one. 

" The individual, Professor N. S. Shaler, as a partial 
a study of Life result of thirty-five years of teach- 
ing, has presented, in "The Indi- 
vidual, a Study of Life and Death " (Appleton), 
an application of the theory of evolution to some of 
the greatest concerns of mankind. A consideration 
of the purely physical realm, and then of that realm 
which contains life, shows that the organic form is 
differentiated from the inorganic by its capacity to 
gather and store experience. Thus each successive 
generation of individuals is nourished, the older 
form, after having transmitted its garnered experi- 
ence, disappearing to make room for the newer. 



Even before man is reached in the chain of life, 
death is established as an indispensable corollary 
and condition of advancement. Educableness, then, 
is the differentiating quality of the organic indi- 
vidual. And death is due, not merely to the process 
of natural selection, the survival of the fittest, 
but also to the sacrifice needed for the due devel- 
opment of the oncoming race. Though the indi- 
viduality of each man amounts to isolation, it is 
only in mankind that the power of sympathy reaches 
its height. Sympathy finds expression in language, 
and otherwise, and is prompted by natural and 
tribal affection, the religious motive, property, and 
especially by social institutions. It is in sympathetic 
outgoing to the needs of his kind that man best 
conquers the fear of death. Professor Shaler has 
made several suggestive departures from the strict 
scope of his field. War, he says, is waste of the 
young life, that, reared at great cost, is not allowed 
to perfect its contribution to the good of the whole. 
Old age should be secured to larger number, and in 
modern society can be utilized for the general profit 
as never before. Immortality is not denied by the 
discoveries of latter-day science, while there are 
certain observed facts that tally with belief in a 
life beyond death. As a whole, this book is the 
result of such observation, experience, and wisdom 
as a young man could not have had. Its pages are 
frequently illuminating outside the line of their 
direct discussion. The open mind and the rever- 
ence of the writer are everywhere evident. As a 
single word of blame amidst the praise there is 
room in a second edition for the correction of nu- 
merous small errors, due to imperfect proof-reading. 

Professor Frank J. Goodnow is a pro- 
lific wr i ter as we u as a logical and 

forcible one. His magnum opus on 
" Comparative Administrative Law," published in 
1893, was soon followed by his " Municipal Home 
Rule " and " Municipal Problems," and to these he 
has now added a work entitled "Politics and Ad- 
ministration, a Study in Government" (Macmil- 
lan). The title corresponds to the author's division 
of the functions of government into the political 
and the administrative the expression and the 
execution of the state's will the judicial function 
being classed as a subdivision of administration. 
Like Mr. Bryce, Professor Goodnow lays much 
stress upon extra-legal institutions ; and he gives in 
an interesting way the history and philosophy of 
such spontaneous political growths as the party, the 
spoils system, and the boss. He advises legal rec- 
ognition of political parties, in a way to make them 
and their leaders responsible to the public, and 
finds encouragement in England's development of 
responsible government and efficient administration 
out of corrupt bossism and a corrupt and inefficient 
civil service. His other principal recommendation 
is in the direction of a reasonable centralization of 
the American administrative system, coupled with 
an extension of the principle of self-government.

" What we need, in order to obtain harmony be- 
tween the locality and the state, is to grant the 
locality more local legislative power than it now 
possesses, and to subject it to central administrative 
control where it is acting as the agent of the state." 

The treatment Whatever store the world may set 
and training by severe academic training, there 

/children. are t j me8 w hen the absence of it is 

refreshing. Such an instance was to be found in 
Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Oilman's " Women and 
Economics," and another is now afforded by her 
newer work " Concerning Children " (Small, May- 
nard & Co.). To a degree hardly known outside 
of that remarkable family of Beechers of which 
she is a member, Mrs. Gil man's work possesses a 
quality that provokes discussion. Whether her 
readers find themselves in complete disagreement 
with her and thus forced to set up a position of 
their own, or holding to certain of her tenets for 
reasons the reverse of hers, there is hardly a page 
of her work that does not have its effect from her 
manner of presentation. She announces with some- 
thing of the joy of the discoverer that children have 
rights of all kinds which the adult is bound to re- 
spect. She does not believe for a moment that a 
stupid, perverse, or untrained mother is better fitted 
to bring up her own child than an intelligent, re- 
ceptive, thoroughly disciplined instructor. She sees 
no reason no spiritual or intellectual reason 
why a man of the highest attainments should re- 
gard it as an honor to instruct youths of twenty, 
when he can do a thousand times more good by 
teaching infants of two. She does not think women 
from the lowest walks in life are the best companions 
for ingenuous youth in kilts ; and the Southern 
contempt for the negro as an associate, with a 
placid acquiescence in any negro being a good 
enough mentor for the Southern child, she regards 
as more than incongruous. But we cannot go further 
into the details of this wholesomely disturbing 
book, which deserves to be read on its own account. 



Mr. Gamer'* Whatever Mr. R. L. Garner has to 
ttudie* among say about our kinsfolk, the Quadru- 
ape* and monkey,. m&I1 a., is reasonably certain to be of 
interest. "Apes and Monkeys, Their Life and 
Language " (Ginn & Co.) is his most important 
popular account of his recent work in searching out 
the psychology of the brute creation nearest us in 
development, physical and intellectual. It contains 
a brief narrative of his stay in the wilds of Africa 
during his attempts to catch the speech and observe 
the manners of the manlike apes in the open forests. 
The account of the words and vocal articulations 
used by these animals for the conveyance of ideas 
is, it may be presumed, to be followed by a less 
popular and more scientifically exact work on the 
subject. It is to be noted with regret that Mr. 
Garner appears to be so unfamiliar with the study 
of phonetics that he has gone to the pains of in- 
venting a system of notation for the sounds used 



by his brute companions, when Mr. Alexander 
Graham Bell's " visible speech " would have an- 
swered every purpose better. Mr. Garner says of 
one of his chimpanzees (page 116) that he "suc- 
ceeded in teaching him one word of human speech," 
a statement not borne out by his fuller account of 
the experiment (pp. 135 et &eq.). Doctor Edward 
Everett Hale provides an interesting introduction 
for the book, which is handsomely designed and 
illustrated. 

Reference book ^ n tne preface to his work on " Pre- 
/ Prehistoric historic Implements " (Robert Clarke 
Co.), Mr. Warren K. Moorehead 
warns us that his book is a reference-book for col- 
lectors, not a hand-book for the professional archae- 
ologist. There are, he informs us, four thousand 
five hundred persons in the United States who own 
collections of relics containing from fifty to twenty- 
five thousand specimens. His book aims to direct 
the efforts of these collectors to profitable ends. 
There is no question that its influence will be help- 
fully felt. The prehistoric relics of the United 
States are described by geographical areas. Some 
of these are discussed by Mr. Moorehead himself, 
but nine assistants, " editors," have presented the 
facts regarding their own local fields. This diver- 
sity of authors has led to a fairly full though 
uneven treatment of hitherto somewhat neglected 
areas; but a well-digested, connected, and sym- 
metrical presentation of the same material by one 
person would have been far more satisfactory. It 
is unfortunate that the illustrations are not better, 
and that greater care was not taken with the word- 
ing of the text and in proof-reading. While a long 
list of errata is given in the early part of the book, 
it does not begin to give the errors ; there are 
probably more unnoted errors than pages in the 
book. The fact that Mr. Moorehead's health was 
in a precarious condition during the time when the 
book was being prepared is some excuse for the 
unsatisfactory form in which it appears. 



Modern pen 
drawing and 

draughtsmen. 



The annual extra Winter Number 
of "The Studio" is this year de- 
voted to an exposition of " Modern 
Pen-Drawings: European and American" (John 
Lane), in a handsomely printed volume issued under 
the editorship of Mr. Charles Holme. The text is 
contributed by special authorities in the various 
countries represented, and forms a comprehensive 
and reliable, though necessarily brief, survey of the 
subject But the main interest of the volume lies 
in the collection of illustrations, which would do 
credit to a much more ambitious and expensive 
work. Every artist commented upon in the text is 
represented, many of the pictures having been 
drawn especially for this purpose. The reproduc- 
tion and general arrangement of the drawings evi- 
dence the same skill and taste that have made 
"The Studio" the most beautiful periodical that 
we have. In the section devoted to American art-

ists a number of errors in the spelling of proper 
names are to be found, and sometimes (as in the 
case of Mr. Gibson) the drawings selected are not 
always fairly representative of the artist's ability. 
But these are minor blemishes that can detract but 
little from one's enjoyment of the work, which is 
really a remarkable one for the price. 

Mr. Frank Hendrick, Ricardo prize 
fellow in Harvard University, has 
written a useful monograph on 
"Railway Control by Commissions" (Putnam's 
"Questions of the Day" series), in which he gives 
an account of railway regulation in France, Italy, 
Austria, Belgium, Germany, England, and the 
United States, describing most fully the Massa- 
chusetts system, which he especially admires, and 
concluding that the best form of control is secured 
by a permanent commission without power. After 
summarizing the proposals of various writers for 
solving the railway problem, the author submits as 
his own solution, (1) the permission of pooling, 
(2) the abolition of the quasi- judicial power of the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, and (3) a sys- 
tem of state commissions on the plan of the Massa- 
chusetts board, to woi k in cooperation with a national 
commission to be organized on the same basis. A 
final chapter gives an account of the state purchase 
of railways in Switzerland. 

A graphic picture In ." A Captive of War " (McClure, 
ofu/einCon- Phillips & Co.) Mr. Solon Hyde, 
/< derate prison,. f ormer ] y Hospital Steward of the 
Seventeenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, tells the suffi- 
ciently stirring tale of his experiences in Confederate 
prisons, notably Libby, Danville, and Andersonville. 
Mr. Hyde was captured by Forrest's cavalry a day 
or two after the battle of Chickamauga, Sept. 19, 
1863, and was finally paroled on Feb. 27, 1865, 
after a variety of experiences, in prison and en 
route from one prison to another, that are well worth 
the telling. The style of the narrative is terse, 
blunt, and unpolished, and there is a certain bitter- 
ness of tone throughout born of the rankling mem- 
ory of scenes of brutality, and of ill-treatment at 
the hands of ruffians of the Wirz type, whom the 
war clothed with a little brief authority. That 
" war is hell" Mr. Hyde's book graphically attests. 

"Old Wickford, the Venice of Amer- 
ica," is the title of a rather attract- 
ively made book of 240 pages, 
wherein Mrs. F. Burge Griswold sets forth pleas- 
antly and intelligently, if with a somewhat exag- 
gerated sense of the general interest of her theme, 
the simple annals of the wave-washed village of 
Wickford, R. I. The little volume seems in some 
sort a labor of love, and the author's manifest at- 
tachment to the scenes whereof she writes imparts 
a tinge of pleasing sentiment to her style. The text 
is printed on paper of a moderate glaze, and the 
score or so of photographic plates are acceptably 
made. (Milwaukee : Young Churchman Co.).

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. have reprinted the 
" Poems " of the late Philip Henry Savage, bringing 
together in a single volume the two small books pub- 
lished during the lifetime of the author, and " the 
best poems found in his portfolio after his death." The 
whole collection is edited by Mr. Daniel Gregory Mason, 
and embellished with a portrait of the writer. 

"The Listening Child," edited by Mrs. Lucy W. 
Thatcher, is a selection of English and American verse 
for " the youngest readers and hearers." It is, as 
Colonel Higginsou says in his introductory note, " care- 
fully thought out and intelligently arranged," and pro- 
vides a great variety of pieces suitable to be placed in 
the hands of readers of sixteen and downwards. The 
Macmillan Co. are the publishers. 

" Orestes A. Brownson's Latter Life," covering his 
last twenty years, has just been published by Mr. Henry 
F. Brownson, the author. This is the third and final 
volume of a biography which, although overgrown, is of 
much interest to both Catholic and Protestant readers. 
Nothing could well be uglier than the mechanical 
make-up of these volumes, and it is a pity that so valu- 
able a work should have such a handicap. 

Omar und kein Ende ! The last thing Omar would 
seem to need is a commentary, but Mr. H. M. Batson 
has thought otherwise, and has gravely explained the 
quatrains one by one. This rather thin performance is 
supplemented by a biographical study of the poet, made 
by Mr. E. D. Ross, and a work of the most admirable 
and scholarly character. FitzGerald's text is sand- 
wiched between these two thick slices of prose, and the 
whole is made into a neat volume by Messrs. Putnams. 

Dr. Edwin Herbert Lewis's " Second Manual of 
Composition," published by the Macmillan Co., carries 
on into the work of more advanced classes the prin- 
ciples and the methods inculcated in the earlier volume. 
It is a helpful and thoroughly practical treatise, in- 
formed by the best scholarship, and deserving of the 
most cordial commendation. 

A revised edition of the standard Spanish-English 
Dictionary of Velasquez has long been needed, and has 
at last been produced by the Messrs. Appleton. The 
editors are Messrs. Edward Gray and Juan L. Iribas. 
The extent of the revision may be indicated by saying 
that eight thousand new titles have been added, together 
with several hundred idioms. The work makes a vol- 
ume of nearly seven hundred pages of three columns 
each. It will be followed in due course by a revision 
of the English-Spanish section, and by revised editions 
of the other lexicographical and educational books of 
Velasquez. 

The National Educational Association held its meet- 
ing of last summer at Charleston, S. C., and the annual 
volume of the proceedings now comes to us from the 
secretary, Mr. Irwin Shepard. As the attendance upon 
the meeting fell below the figures of recent years, so 
the volume falls considerably below the standard of 
size set by its recent predecessors. But it contains over 
eight hundred pages, and proves a valuable repository 
of current educational opinion. Among the more im- 
portant subjects discussed are "The Small College," 
by Presidents Thompson and Harper; "The Problem 
of the South, ' by Mr. Booker T. Washington; " Alcohol 
Physiology,'' by Dr. W. O. Atwater; and " Educational 
Progress during the Year," by the late B. A. Hiusdale.

Clarendon Press. 

Mr. Herbert Spencer's " First Principles," written 
forty years ago, has been three times revised by the 
author, and in the edition now published by the Messrs. 
Appleton, the work reappears in what will doubtless 
prove its definitive form. A fine portrait of Mr. Spencer 
dignifies this volume. 

The " American Art Annual " for 1900-1901, pub- 
lished by Messrs. Noyes, Platt & Co., is the third issue 
of that useful work of reference. The matter has been 
brought down to date by the editor, Miss Florence N.

from oblivion by a friendly hand, have been repnb- 
lished, with a portrait, by Messrs. Henry T. Coates & 
Co. The original edition, never strictly published, was 
dated Philadelphia, 1835. The author died only some 
ten years ago, but wrote no verse during the last half- 
century of his life. 



The Rowfant Club of Cleveland will begin in March 
the publication of a reprint of the famous Boston 
" Dial " of 1840-44. The sixteen numbers of the orig- 
inal issue will be reproduced in exact facsimile, and a

"THE DIAL'S good sense, its sound critical judgment, liberal 
spirit, and high principles, all maintained with simplicity, steadi- 
ness, and without pretension, have secured the respect as well as 
the cordial regard of its readers." CHARLES ELIOT NORTON. 
HARVARD UNIVERSITY, April 21, 1900. 


'"THE DIAL has a very definite aim and scope, 
^ though by no means a narrow one. By con- 
cerning itself, not with Books alone bat with 
Literature in the largest sense, following the best 
models of the older countries in which the pros- 
perity and standing of journals of its class are a 
measure of the current civilization, it makes itself 
distinctive in America. It is preeminently " A 
Journal of Literary Criticism, Discussion, and In- 
formation." In addition to its treatment of Books, 
it discusses literary movements and tendencies, 
gives information of literary people and events, 
and includes whatever pertains to literary affairs 
and related subjects of higher intellectual concern. 


"By the sanity of it* literary 
judgments, by the catholicity of 
its tastes and of its opinions, and 
by the responsible character of 
its signed book reviews, THE DIAL 
makes a peculiarly strong appeal 
to men and women interested in 
the study of literature." 
NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER. 
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, 
NEW YORK, March 28, 1900. 

" From no literary journal, for- 
eign or domestic, have I derived 
more profit than from THE DIAL,

"THE DIAL has gained the solid respect of the country as a 
serious and impartial journal of literary criticism, without resort- 
ing to pictures or personalities, or mistaking the back-stairs gossip 
about writers for literature." CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER.

A YEAR ago we published an authoritative biography of Sir Arthur

were disappointed, however, by the fact that it was not purchased more 

generally by the libraries. The 
work is acknowledged by those 
who have seen it to be a definitive 
life of the great composer, and we 
were assured that it deserved a place 
in all libraries. We infer that libra-

ciently well to justify themselves in 
ordering it, and we are therefore

This is the authorized biography of the great com- 
poser. It was prepared under his personal supervision, 
and revised by him in proof before his death. The 
volume, fully illustrated as it is, with letters, portraits, 
and musical scores, is an ideal reference work for a 
library. The Gilbert and Sullivan operas have such 
a firm place on the stage of our time, that a close

EBEN HOLDEN 



By IRVING BACHELLER 

WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS 

" I have read ' Eben Holden ' with a great joy in 
its truth and freshness. You have got into your book 
a kind of life not in literature before, and you have 
got it there simply and frankly. It is 'as pure as 
water and as good as bread.' ' 

MARGARET E. SANQSTER 

" It is sweet with the smell of the balsam . Whenever 
one finds a real book he or she owes it to the rest to tell 
them about it that they may read and enjoy it too. 
So I pass the ivord along: Read ' Eben Holden." " 



225TH THOUSAND 

MARY E. WILKINS 

"It seems to me a most remarkable production, 
way and way ahead of ' David Harum,' which is not 
to be mentioned in comparison with it. Eben 
Holden ' is simply adorable. I have not read a book 
in many a day by an American author which has so 
pleased me." 

AMELIA E. BARR 

" I congratulate you on having given the world a 
pure, strong, natural story. It is as far above ' David 
Harum * as noonday is above dawn." 



EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN 

"It is a forest-scented, fresh-aired, bracing, and wholly American story of country and town life. . . . 
If, in the far future, our successors wish to know what were the real life and atmosphere in which the country 
folk that saved this nation grew, loved, wrought, and had their being, they must go back to such true and 
zestful and poetic tales of 'fiction ' as ' Snow Bound' and ' Eben Holden.' '

"Both an interesting and a useful book. While it is con-

a particular department of literary art, it carries a general 
application that all literary workers may profit by, as in its 
chapters on Titles, Style, and the Labor of Authorship."

ance to the novice in short story writing." Rev. of Reviews.

CHINESE HUMOR 

A GENERAL WAS HARD PRESSED IN BATTLE AND ON THE POINT OF 
GIVING WAY, WHEN SUDDENLY A SPIRIT SOLDIER CAME TO THE RESCUE 
AND ENABLED HIM TO WIN A GREAT VICTORY. PROSTRATING HIMSELF 
ON THE GROUND, HE ASKED THE SPIRIT'S NAME. "I am the God of the 
Target," REPLIED THE SPIRIT. And how have I merited your godship's kind 
assistance?" INQUIRED THE GENERAL. "I am grateful to you," ANSWERED 
THE SPIRIT, " because in your days of practice you never once hit me." 

CHINESE PROVERBS 

Deal with the faults of others as gently as with your own. Oblige and you will be obliged. 

A man thinks he knows, but a woman knows better. If you fear that people will know, don 't do it. 

Armies are maintained for years to be used on a single day. He who rides a tiger cannot dismount.

A Masterpiece of Biography 

In a recent vote solicited by the London Academy as to the ten best books of the year 1900, a ma- 
jority of the readers who expressed their opinion put second not a novel, but a biography ! 

The Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley 

By his son, LEONARD HUXLEY. It is in two 8vo volumes, illustrated, with 549 and 547 pp., index; pub- 
lished by D. APPLETON AND COMPANY, at $5.00 net, in cloth. 

E. L. G. [E. L. GODKIN], in the New York Evening Post, says that: " Whatever success England has achieved 
during the past century has been largely due to the frequency with which such biographies as those of BURKE, PITT, 
JOHNSON and CHATHAM, WELLINGTON, PEEL and COBDEN, PALMERSTON, MACAULAY and TENNYSON, LYALL, 
DARWIN and HUXLEY have been put before the youth of the nation." He goes on to call that of Huxley " one of the 
most instructive and brilliant of English lives." This opinion is echoed by the press everywhere.

OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 

An interesting article contributed by Mr. 
Herbert Putnam to the January " International 
Monthly " sums up the progress of recent years 
in American library development. The public 
library in the United States has become so 
important a part of our educational ma- 
chinery and so influential a factor in our 
intellectual life that the principal facts con- 
cerning its development should be in the pos- 
session of every intelligent person, and it is 
desirable that they should be summed up from 
time to time by some writer of Mr. Putnam's 
experience and authority. As librarian of 
our great national collection of books he is 
officially at the head of his profession in the 
United States, and those who know anything 
of his zeal and his equipment do not need to 
be told that the profession could not well have 
a worthier leader. 

The very use of this word " profession " 
suggests what is probably the most striking 
fact of all in the history of the American 
library movement. Twenty-five years ago, 
people thought of a librarian as a custodian of 
books, usually a helpless sort of person as far 
as practical affairs were concerned, and not 
infrequently a crusty one. To speak of his 
occupation as a profession was to use strange 
language, and to make one look askance at the 
speaker. And indeed, there were then few 
professional librarians to be found. But the 
pioneer work which was being done by Poole 
and Winsor, together with a few of their con- 
temporaries, has since then borne rich fruit, 
and librarianship is now a professional calling 
in as exact and distinct a sense as is the occu- 
pation of the lawyer or the physician. It has 
its professional schools and associations, its 
professional ideals and ethical principles, just 
as the bar and the pulpit have them, and may 
be taken up as a life vocation with the same 
certainty that opportunity for its exercise will 
be found, and that success will be the reward 
of exceptional ability. 

This settlement of the librarian's status has 
been made, as we have already mentioned, 
during the last quarter of a century. A good 



66 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1, 



many other things of importance to the pro- 
fession have also been done during the same 
period, such, for example, as the establishment 
and maintenance of " The Library Journal," 
the formation of the American Library Asso- 
ciation, and the adoption of enlightened library 
legislation by a large number of the States. 
The decade of the seventies witnessed the be- 
ginnings of all three of these movements, for, 
although there were library laws before that 
time, the Illinois statute of 1872 set a new 
pace, and placed the public library upon a more 
substantial foundation than had before sup- 
ported it. When we speak of the advance in 
library economy and administration, and of the 
methods by which libraries have increased their 
helpfulness for all classes of users, we are at a 
loss to know where to begin in the enumeration 
of things done. A rough list will include 
State commissions, travelling libraries, open 
shelves, popular lectures, children's depart- 
ments, delivery stations, the extension of service 
into the schools, annotated lists for readers, 
and cooperative methods of cataloguing. To 
the outsider, these terms mean little that is 
definite, but to the close observer of recent 
library activities, each of them connotes an 
agency of approved educational value, and a 
development to which a volume might easily 
be devoted. 

One result of all this multiplication of ac- 
tivities is, however, sure to impress the most 
casual observer, and is equally sure of being 
misunderstood. In the old days, the funds of 
a library were largely devoted to the purchase 
of books ; in our own times, the purchase of 
books seems to have become a matter of minor 
importance. It is rather startling to learn that 
the Boston Public Library, for every dollar of 
its income that goes into books, spends ten 
dollars in other ways, yet such is about the 
proportion that must be exhibited by the bud- 
get of any institution of the size of one of our 
great city libraries. Nor will one thoroughly 
conversant with the services performed through 
the agency of a modern library building, and 
by the labors of its trained staff, find it pos- 
sible to deny that the ten dollars are as wisely 
and usefully expended as the one. The scholar 
may object, but public libraries are not for 
the benefit of the scholar alone, and the class 
to which he belongs, at any rate, gets as large 
a share of their benefits as any ocher class. 
Indeed, no collection of books can be of much 
value to the community as a whole, unless the 
means for exploiting it, and for bringing it to 



bear upon every form of intellectual need and 
craving, are provided quite as generously as 
are the books themselves. Every library, for 
example, soon reaches a point at which a few 
thousand dollars may far more judiciously be 
expended upon the preparation of an expert 
catalogue than upon any additions, however 
urgently demanded, to its stores. It is dif- 
ficult for a layman to see this, but to the in- 
itiated, it becomes a proposition so obvious as 
to need no demonstration. 

The public library of the twentieth century 
is not going to abandon any of the methods, 
worked out in so painstaking a fashion, by 
which our public collections of books have been 
made second in educational importance to the 
public schools alone. They will all be devel- 
oped still further in the direction of helpfulness, 
of the bridging over of difficulties, and of the 
stimulation of an interest in reading among 
all classes. To them still other methods will 
be added from time to time, even at the cost 
of still further lessening the funds with which 
books are bought, for the purpose of a library 
is not to preserve books, but to circulate them. 
And approval of the methods of modern pro- 
fessional librarianship will continue to be evi- 
denced, as in the past, and in a constantly 
growing ratio, by increased public support and 
by the still greater multiplication of generous 
private foundations. Our country leads the 
world in the use that it makes of public libra- 
ries, and it is going to maintain the leadership 
already won by every means that are now de- 
vised, or may hereafter be devised. We have 
no intention of going into prophesy at this 
time, but we will venture one prediction, to 
the effect that the next marked development 
of library activity will be found in the schools, 
and that books will be brought to bear upon 
the studies of young people to an extent, and 
with beneficial results, of which few educators 
now dream. When the use of books comes to 
have as important a part in the work of the 
historical and literary group of studies as the 
use of the microscope and the balance now has 
in the scientific group of studies when in 
every school the library shall be as well pro- 
vided as the laboratory now is then the next 
important step in education will have been 
made, and men will wonder why it should have 
been left for the twentieth century to make. 
We content ourselves here with this general 
statement, reserving a more detailed and spe- 
cific treatment of the subject for some future 
occasion.

A LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL NOVEL. 

Amending a familiar thought, a novel is a picture 
of life seen through the prism of an author's mind. 
When the picture seems to as clear and true, we 
recognize its technical excellence ; and if in addi- 
tion it has the interest that attaches to a truthful 
transcript of action, passion, character, and thought, 
we call the picture a great one. 

Amid the discussions which centre around the his- 
torical novel, it appears strange that no more effort 
has been made to differentiate it from the others. 
It seems taken for granted that an historical novel 
is an historical novel ; hut the varying treatment 
of the theme shows the widely differing ideas which 
exist on the subject. A distinction would be useful, 
and should not be exceedingly hard to make. Any 
novel is certainly in one sense historical, but by 
carrying out logically the common and somewhat 
hazy idea we can arrive at a definition that carries 
with it the necessary distinction. Should we not 
consider the true historical novel as one which has 
to do with people seeming to have had a part in 
the greater events, the larger forces, that make 
history ? 

To illustrate the distinction carried in this def- 
inition, look at " Cranford " and " Hugh Wynne." 
Probably the former is a more truthful, as it cer- 
tainly is a more convincing, picture of bygone days 
than the latter ; but one would not think of classing 
them together. 

Of the novels of history accessible to English 
readers there are few indeed which can be placed 
in the front rank ; for many a work which would 
reach this place is barred by a lack of one or more 
of the essential characteristics, among which are 
good workmanship, a convincing portrayal of life, 
a life in the main current of events. The fatal 
defect, and the most common, is the absence of 
that spirit which would give us the innate motif of 
the time. Take for an example " Ivanhoe," one 
of the most celebrated novels in the language. The 
story is most interesting, the picture is clear, it has 
the interest that attaches to well-drawn action and 
character ; but its people are moderns, living par- 
tially the mediaeval life ; we get from the book 
hardly the slightest inkling of the basic brntishness 
and savagery of the time. That chivalry which 
was only a fall of lace on the dirty clothing of 
society is transformed by the touch of the wizard's 
pen into the fabric itself. The fault is characteristic 
both of Scott and of the great school which has 
followed in his footsteps, though all will admit that 
we owe to this school some splendid stories. Kings- 
ley's best works, " Hypatia," " Westward-Ho," and 
" Hereward," have this same lack ; but it seems 
certain that had Kingsley not been so hampered 
by his profession and his public, his work would 
stand in the foreground, for he had in him much 
of the artistic essence, and red blood runs in the 
veins of his people. 

Consider for a moment two novels which cer- 



tainly do stand in the foreground of literature. 
The Three Musketeers " is a model in its way, 
but the ground on which the heroes stand we feel 
to be a little uncertain ; a glowing, shifting haze 
hangs over and between us and "the immortal 
three who were four." Still, it would take greater 
faults than these to displace so good a story. The 
other, " Henry Esmond," of all the acknowledged 
standards, should probably be placed first, for it has 
almost every element which goes to the making of 
the ideal historical novel. Of course, Thackeray 
shrinks from a full portrayal; but the real life is 
so suggested where it cannot be told, the action and 
plot are so interesting, the characters are so clear- 
cut, the men and events treated are so important 
to the period, that the novel is practically above 
criticism, and to many it has seemed above success- 
ful rivalry. 

But in the universe of letters a new planet has 
swum into the ken of recent observers. We have 
now a writer who perhaps more fully than any 
other has met the requirements of a literary mas- 
terpiece, and that man is the Polish author, Sien- 
kiewicz. He who has not yet made the acquaintance 
of the trilogy, "With Fire and Sword," "The 
Deluge," and " Pan Michael," has before him the 
pleasure of reading works almost unique, that carry 
out nearly to perfection the idea of a great historical 
novel putting before us, in a light as vivid as our 
latter day ideas will permit us to enjoy, the life of 
the past. These stories oft-times lack delicacy of 
touch and finish ; they have incidents that seem 
needlessly brutal and reach the limits of our in- 
dulgence ; they treat of life and character so alien 
that at first thought they seem unreal. Tet we soon 
know that we are seeing life as men lived it, that 
the author is a creator of people who live and move 
and have being. We find characters drawn with 
an unerring hand ; we come to understand that a 
master of masters is putting before us the rush and 
sweep of great events, the elemental passions, all 
the vital constituents of the life of the time of 
which he treats. 

We have some new friends when we have finished 
these stories. There is that " combination of 
Ulysses and Falstaff," Zagloba. with his unfailing 
resource and wit, with the most human and laugh- 
able and lovable admixture of courage and cow- 
ardice, of selfishness and generosity, a character 
destined to live among the few immortal creations 
of fiction. There is that whole company of noble- 
men, imbued with the strangest compound of religion 
and savagery, of singlemindedness and subtlety, 
men of a race whose spirit is in many ways repel- 
lant to us, yet which compels our admiration and 
respect, for it formed the bulwark between Europe 
and the powers of darkness. 

There is hardly an indistinct character amid 
them all, nor among those charming women whom 
they loved and whom we love. Above all, there is 
Pan Michael, whose fortunes we follow through the 
trilogy the little man who never met his match

with the sword (and that not from lack of trying) ; 
the faithful friend, the devoted lover of his king, 
his country, and woman. Here is a man whom we 
love as we do D'Artagnan and for the same reason, 
which is that our hearts go out to him who is not 
too far removed from earth, a man who boldly and 
fearlessly works out his fate. We have a sense 
of something lacking in a hero like Henry Esmond. 
Who of us does not feel some sympathy with 
Beatrix when she tells him he would have gotten 
along better w\th her had he not been on his knees 
to her so much. 

Sienkiewicz's later and more popular " Quo 
Vadis " is far inferior as a novel to any one of the 
trilogy, though one must recognize the power of 
the descriptions, the strength of the characters 
especially that of Petronius and the realism of 
the whole, this last being the crucial test. The 
novel in which Sienkiewicz has last been presented 
to English readers, " The Knights of the Cross," is 
hardly up to the standard of his best, though strong 
and fine in every way. 

The impression made by Sienkiewicz is best 
characterized by saying that after almost any other 
novelist one feels that he has been looking at a pic- 
ture, or at best at a "moving picture." After 
Sienkiewicz one feels that he has looked on life.

SOME NEGLECTED MATERIAL IN ANTI-SLAVERY 

LITERATURE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Professor Barrett Wendell, in his " Literary History 
of America," seems to have neglected certain obvious 
opportunities iu dealing with the literary history of the 
Anti-Slavery agitation. There died in Ohio as far back 
as 1833, Charles B. Storrs, President of Western Re- 
serve College, who was the real pioneer of the remark- 
able Anti-Slavery or Abolition movement in that part 
of the country, which soon involved Giddings and 
Wade. Yet Professor Wendell, who devotes much 
space not simply to Anti-Slavery literature, but to 
the Anti-Slavery agitation in general, has not a word 
for Storrs, whose services for the cause in the West 
were fully recognized by the New England workers 
for that same cause, as is shown by Whittier's beautiful 
elegy. This brings me to the Harvard professor's 
omission of a literary landmark which is unexplainable, 
as it was not a Western but a distinctly New England 
landmark. The author dwells at length and most in- 
terestingly on Mrs. Stowe's epoch-marking "Uncle 
Tom's Cabin," but he makes not the slightest allusion 
to the initial literary work of the propaganda. In 1833, 
the same year when Storrs, the pioneer of Abolition in 
Ohio, died, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child (nee Francis), a 
native of Massachusetts, published " An Appeal for 
That Class of Americans Called Africans," which was 
the first Anti-Slavery book published in America. It 
may not be generally known as such, for Allibone 
does not so state, nor does he give the exact title of the 



book, nor any date whatsoever, but the fact is incon- 
testible, and as such of course deserving of a place in 
the literary history of the country. That it has none 
in the work of Professor Wendell, taken in conjunction 
with numerous other important omissions, may seem to 
some an indication of inconsiderate haste ou his part, 
and to a certain extent to detract from the dignity of 
history, titularly claimed for his work.

A DISTRESSING MISQUOTATION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It is probable that the Anthology of Mr. Stedman 
will be regarded by the judicious as proof of the pov- 
erty of our American poetic lore rather than as con- 
vincing evidence of our riches. It will be generally 
conceded, however, that Edgar Allen Poe was a real 
poet; only his contributions are so small. But one of 
his most characteristic and attractive gems is marred 
in Mr. Stedman's book by one of the most diabolical 
blunders of misquotation in all the annals of printing; 
and this will be copied no doubt unwittingly many 
times. I refer to the lines " To One in Paradise ": 
" And all my days are trances, 
And all my nightly dreams 
Are where thy dark eye glances 

And where thy footstep gleams 
In what ethereal dances, 
By what eternal streams." 

Instead of " dark eye " Mr. Stedman has " gray eye "! 

"Gray eye glances"! That distressing alliteration 
would have ruined the fame of Milton. S.

A MODERN STOIC.* 



The story is told of the third Earl of Shaftes- 
bury that, rising to make his maiden speech in 
Parliament on the bill allowing counsel to a 
prisoner accused of treason, he became so em- 
barrassed and confused as to break down alto- 
gether ; but being encouraged by the House to 
go on, he made a great impression by the in- 
genuous remark : " If I, sir, who rise only to 
speak my opinion on the bill now depending, 
am so confounded that I am unable to express 
the least of what I proposed to say, what must 
the condition of that man be who is pleading 
for his life without any assistance and under 
apprehension of being deprived of it?" This 
happy turn pleased his listeners extremely, and 
was thought to have done more toward passing 
the bill than any of the more solid arguments 
advanced in its support. The incident is char-

acteristie of the man, and stamps him as a 
worthy predecessor to the noble and philan- 
thropic seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, his more 
famous descendant. 

Dr. Rand's volume on the third Lord Shaftes- 
bury deals far less with the public life of the 
Earl than with that inward growth revealed by 
his philosophical writings and private corre- 
spondence. Indeed, his delicate constitution 
prevented him from engaging actively in poli- 
tics, although he seems to have made his mark 
in Parliament, and was offered the secretary- 
ship of state by King William, whose trusted 
adviser he continued to be for some years. He 
died an early death in 1713, within a few 
weeks of his forty-second birthday. His son's 
biography of him, first published in Bayle's 
" General Dictionary," and now reprinted, with 
some additions from the biographer's manu- 
scripts, in this volume, and Series V. of the 
Shaftesbury Papers, preserved in the Record 
Office, are the chief sources of our information 
regarding the Earl. Dr. Rand devotes nearly 
half of his portly volume to the Letters, rather 
more than half to the " Philosophical Regimen," 
and fourteen pages to the brief " Life," all, 
excepting the letters to Locke and the biog- 
raphy, being published for the first time from 
the Shaftesbury Papers. 

To the non-classical student the book may 
seem to bristle formidably with Greek and 
Latin quotations, but a second glance will show 
that these are nearly all translated or para- 
phrased, so that his alarm is groundless. To 
the lover of the classics the volume will have 
a flavor of old-fashioned scholarship not un- 
grateful in an age which sees the editor of a 
leading English literary review gravely refer- 
ring to the temple of Janus as closed in time 
of war, and an editorial writer in one of our 
own most scholarly journals ascribing the 
" Miles Gloriosus " to Terence. The disciple 
of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius will be glad 
to give the " Philosophical Regimen " a place 
beside the " Enchiridion " and the " Medita- 
tions." The key-note of the work is struck in 
the essay on " Improvement," where, after re- 
ferring to the practice of making memoranda 
for various less worthy uses, the author con- 
tinues : 

"Would one think of making any for Lifef Would 
one think that this were a business to improve in? 
What if this should be the thing of all others chosen 
out for a pocket-book and memorandums ? But so it 
is. ... Begin therefore and work upon this subject. 
Collect, digest, methodize, abstract. How many codes, 



how many volumes, how much labour, and what com- 
piling in the study of other laws ? But in the law of 
life how ? They who seek not any such in life, nor 
think that there is any rule, what are they better than 
vulgar?" 

It is to be regretted that the style of the 
work is so largely that of the note-book, in 
which occasional memoranda are jotted down 
with little regard to literary form. Nearly 
always labored and often bombastic in his ut- 
terance, the author has repelled rather than 
attracted readers. Even his once famous 
" Characteristics " has long lain neglected. 
Yet we should not forget that he was admired 
in his own century by such critics as Hurd and 
Blair. That he should have had so little of 
Addison's elegance, of Swift's perspicuity, 
simplicity, and strength, of Steele's ease and 
vivacity, and all three of these were his im- 
mediate contemporaries, is somewhat sur- 
prising. But occasionally his manner is hardly 
less admirable than his matter, as when, treat- 
ing of the passions, he writes thus aptly and 
forcibly concerning " Joy ": 

" There is one sort of joy which is fierce, eager, 
boisterous, impetuous, restless, which carries with it a 
sort of insatiableness, rage, madness, sting; and which 
afterwards is followed by disgust and discontent. There 
is another sort of joy which is soft, still, peaceable, 
serene, which has no mixture or alloy ; of which there 
is no excess, but the more it is felt, the more perfect 
and refined it grows, the more content and satisfaction 
it yields through the whole of life. To the first of these 
a thousand things are necessary, a thousand outward 
and casual circumstances concurring, the least of which 
being removed, or ceasing, it also must cease. To the 
second there is nothing necessary but what depends 
upon ourselves." 

It adds much to the weight of Shaftesbury 's 
counsels to know that he practised what he 
preached, so far as we can learn from his con- 
temporaries ; and thus his lumbering periods 
make an impression where a Seneca's rhetorical 
flights of would-be stoicism fail to convince. 
" Perhaps no modern," writes Toland in his 
introduction to the Shaftesbury letters, " ever 
turned the ancients more into sap and blood, 
as they say, than he. Their doctrines he un- 
derstood as well as themselves, and their vir- 
tues he practised better." " Just as Spinoza 
was ' God-intoxicated,' " says the Earl's latest 
editor, " so Shaftesbury was * intoxicated with 
the idea of virtue.' He is the greatest Stoic 
of modern times. Into his own life he wrought 
the stoical virtue for virtue's sake. This ex- 
alted purpose he sought to attain by means of

abide the three great exponents of stoical phil-

Lord Shaftesbury's influence on the men of 
his time was considerable. Voltaire calls him 
the boldest of English philosophers perhaps 
questionable praise and Diderot's " Essai 
sur le Merite et la Vertu " is a free translation 
of the Earl's "Inquiry concerning Virtue." 
He enjoyed the friendship of Locke, Pope, 
Lord Somers, Lord Halifax, and many others 
eminent either in literature or in public affairs. 
His reputation as a free-thinker hurt him in 
some quarters, but his wholesome influence for 
liberality of thought and freedom of inquiry 
could not have been other than widespread.

letter-writers, are yet interesting reading. 
Their formality and stately courtesy even 
his own mother he always addresses as " your 
ladyship" are characteristic of the period, 
but a little chilling to the reader, and a little 
tiresome. 

A book, Dr. Johnson declares, should help 
us to enjoy life or to endure it. This note- 
worthy contribution to the literature of stoicism 
is well fitted for the latter purpose, nor, we 
believe, will its perusal entirely fail of accom- 
plishing the former.

HOMER IN THE VULGAR TONGUE.* 

The adequate translation of Homer is doubt- 
less the most imperative task set, for the clas- 
sical scholar, in the interests of general culture. 
Very few men can ever have, and even fewer 
can retain, an accurate knowledge of the 
Greek poem. Indeed the specialist himself 
reaches only one certainty : that he does not 
possess, and can never restore, the original 
text. The Homeric vocabulary is very large, 
and the meanings of many words are merely 
surmised, or are still fought over. Yet in the 
history of poetry, in mythology, even in socio- 
logical and ethnological studies, the Iliad and 
Odyssey must always be of peculiar and unique 
importance. They are the first chapters in the 
history of European culture. We should have 
an interpretation, and a comment, by a syndi- 
cate of scholars, which would have for the 
layman such authority as the Revised Version 
now enjoys. 

* THE ODYSSEY. Rendered into English Prose by Samuel 
Butler. New York : Longmans, Green, & Co. 



The present reviewer believes firmly that 
the poetic tone and spirit, and also the unit 
of the line or verse, are indispensable elements 
in every great poem. Hence Longfellow's 
Dante, which attempts to preserve both, is a 
better-directed effort than Mr. Norton's ver- 
sion, which wholly abandons the metrical form. 
Voss's line-for-line German version of Iliad 
and Odyssey is almost ideal. 

But the general voice of our generation 
seems adverse to all this. The translation of 
Homer probably best-known in America is 
still the dignified, musical, rather slow work 
of the poet Bryant's old age. To the eye his 
rendering is "blank verse," and the ten-syllable 
line is quite too short to express the average 
contents of an Homeric hexameter. For the 
ear this verse has no well-defined close, and is 
indeed often plain prose. Furthermore, the 
most notable recent renderings have been 
avowedly prosaic. Mr. Lang and his partners 
still retained an archaic flavor, and somewhat 
elevated diction. Mr. Palmer descended to the 
simplest and most direct forms of contemporary 
English. Mr. Samuel Butler has taken a 
much longer stride down the same slope. He 
has deliberately emptied each phrase of all 
noble allusiveness or charm, and gives us the 
blunt fact in vulgar colloquial words. We do 
not think he would himself quarrel with this 
statement. 

A typical instance is Odyssey, Book V., vss. 
1545, with its inimitable antithesis. Bryant 
indicates the contrast poetically, though he 
does not attempt the artistic repetition of the 
last word : 

"Night after night 

He slept constrained within the hollow cave, 
The unwilling by the fond.'' 

Butcher and Lang rise to the occasion, and 
expanding slightly give us : " Howsoever by 
night he would sleep by her, as needs he must, 
in the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a will- 
ing lady." Mr. Palmer has a similar render- 
ing. Mr. Butler offers us : " He had got tired 
of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep 
with her in the cave by night, it w.as she, not 
he, would have it so." Words like " hurry- 
skurry ing," phrases like " There is no account- 
ing for luck," were never meant to suggest 
poetry. The clearest note, perhaps, is struck 
at II. 20, where Antiphos, a companion of 
Odysseus, is mentioned. " The savage Cyclops 
killed him in the cave, and on him made a 
supper last of all," says Mr. Palmer. There 
may be a bit of tragic irony here, in that poor 



1901.] 



THE DIAL.

Antiphos just failed to escape with the rest of 
the crew. Mr. Butler actually makes it read 
that the Cyclops " cooked his (Antiphos') last 
meal for him," and comments thus : " So we 
vulgarly say ' had cooked his goose ' or ' had 
settled his hash.' " If this is the mature result 
of literal prose translation, let us by all means 
" hurry-skurry " back to Pope, with his deftly- 
managed clattering pair of stilts ! 

It is fair to say that this well-printed version 
seems based on competent study of Greek, is 
as a rule carefully and faithfully done, and in 
the notes the translator shows personal famil- 
iarity with Mediterranean lands. The discussion 
of passages borrowed more or less awkwardly 
from the Iliad into the younger poem is often 
acute and stimulating, though it is startling to 
hear this spoken of as a newly-discovered or 
unworked vein of scholarship. 

Mr. Butler announces this translation as a 
supplement to his " The Authoress of the 
Odyssey," published in 1897. This was an 
attempt to demonstrate that the Odyssey was 
written by a girl, who lived at Trapani on the 
west coast of Sicily, that all Odysseus' adven- 
tures really amounted to a mere circumnaviga- 
tion of that island: and that the authoress 
has put in Nausicaa as a flattering portrait 
of herself. He announces in the preface to 
the present volume that no serious criticism 
of these theses has reached him, and yet he 
by no means thinks that " scholars generally 
acquiesce in " his conclusions. Both these 
latter statements are doubtless true, and will 
probably remain no less so. Even the inventor 
himself, at least in this book, keeps up the dis- 
cussion in a rather bantering spirit, calling at- 
tention to feminine inconsistency, girlish shy- 
ness and ignorance, etc., in the Odyssean 
passages which seem to make for his novel 
and air-spun theory. 

Facing p. 72 are two photographic views of 
S. Cusumano's salt-works, a sort of dyke on 
the flat Sicilian shore. The former tidal inlet, 
now silted up, is, it seems, the original for the 
beautiful river into which Ulysses swam, to 
land safely on the Scherian shore. But the 
same place was introduced, it further appears, 
in three other sets of passages in the Odyssey, 
as (1) the harbor of Rheithron in Ithaca, (2) 
the place where Ulysses landed in Ithaca, (3) 
the place where Telemachus landed in Ithaca. 
All these shrivel to a little muddy silted-up 
Sicilian tideway : ex uno disce omnia.

A POETIC DRAMA.* 



Critics are very apt to object strongly to 
what they call "closet plays." They some- 
times call them " literary dramas," but that 
name is not a very good one, for it seems to 
deny the literary element in many dramas 
which are meant for the stage and very well 
suited to it. By whatever name called, how- 
ever, the theatrical critic looks askance on the 
drama written by a man who writes because 
he wants to, even though he sees no particular 
chance of having his play presented. A recent 
writer deplores the " literary drama " and the 
fascination it had for the great English poets 
of the nineteenth century : he says it has a para- 
lysing effect, although it is not clear upon 
whom. 

The critic, however, who is more apt to read 
plays than to see them, may well wonder at such 
a view. We have, for instance, among other 
books, " Ghost of Rosalys " by Mr. Charles 
Leonard Moore. We should regret to regard 
it as something not worth doing, something of 
a paralysing effect. Indeed it was worth doing 
and it has no such effect. Some closet plays, 
doubtless, are really very bad : when the poet 
divorces himself from all possibility of stage 
presentation, he perhaps feels a lack of restraint 
that is demoralizing. But after all it can hardly 
be a certainty with any play that it will not be 
presented. " Faust " has been presented many 
times ; the second part as well as the first. 
" Manfred " has been often presented, and that 
very effectively. " Brand " has been given a 
number of times. Almost anything can be 
presented if there are people who wish to pre- 
sent it. It is true that when presented, it may 
not be successful, for there may not be anyone 
that wants to see it. But then, such is the 
case with some plays written expressly for the 
stage. 

There is really no very strict criterion of a 
closet play. The only condition (and a simple 
one it is) is that the writer shall have before 
him the absolute impossibility of stage presen- 
tation. Such was the case, probably, with 
Shelley in writing "Prometheus Unbound"; 
possibly with Swinburne in " Atalanta in 
Calydon." But the greater number of what 
are generally thought of as literary dramas 
are plays that one can imagine on the stage. 
We can imagine Mr. Moore's play on the stage : 
indeed, we have done so with pleasure. The

Moore. Philadelphia : Printed for the Author.

fact that an audience of our day might not 
much care to see it, if it were presented, has 
little* to do with the matter. An audience of 
our day would not care for many of Shake- 
speare's plays, nor did the audience for which 
Shakespeare's plays were originally written 
care for them more than they did for a good 
many other plays now forgotten save by readers. 
The test of a closet play cannot go much far- 
ther than has been indicated : if the writer has 
had a general view to stage conditions, then it 
is not a closet play that he writes, no matter 
how literary it may be and no matter how little 
" stage technique " it may have. Stage tech- 
nique may be needful for a successful presen- 
tation, just as types and ink are needed to 
make a book. But both are trivial matters, 
as is clear when we think how little stage 
technique avails Massinger, Congreve, Robert- 
son to-day, just about as little and as much 
as types and ink. 

That a play is not written expressly for the 
stage, that it is not meant for immediate per- 
formance, that it has not been presented any- 
where, these things, then, are not reasons 
why we may not have something very good. 
The fact of a successful stage presentation is 
nothing in favor of a play nowadays ; it should, 
on the other hand, warn us against a play. If 
we hear that a play has been successfully pre- 
sented, the chances are that it is a bad play. 
"Cyrano de Bergerac " succeeded, but so did 
" The Christian," and more plays are like the 
latter than like the former. 

Hence, we may read with pleasure if we 
like poetry several plays which have been 
of late published by American writers. Mr. 
Moody's "Masque of Judgment," Professor 
Raymond's "The Aztec God," Mrs. Fields's 
" Orpheus," Mr. Moore's play which we have 
mentioned, with these books we have a pos- 
sibility of finding something charming and at- 
tractive, that is lacking when we read Mr. 
Fitch's " Barbara Frietchie " or Mr. Thomas's 
" Arizona." These latter plays have already 
charmed and attracted in the way for which 
they were intended ; as books they are like 
pressed flowers that have no sentimental asso- 
ciations. 

After all aside from the possibility of a 
closet play why should a poet not put his 
ideas in dramatic form ? It is surely a con- 
venience, in that it enables him, if he wishes, 
to present certain essential dramatic elements 
and to omit a great many other elements of 
which he does not feel the need. The dramatic 



form allows one to hold the attention close to 
the development of the idea without the dis- 
traction of description or comment. It has its 
drawbacks in return for these advantages, but 
used with proper regard for its proper charac- 
teristics the drama is undoubtedly a powerful 
literary form as well as a valuable theatrical 
attraction. 

This play of Mr. Moore's was presumably 
not written for the stage, but it is not a play 
in which the author has neglected theoretical 
possibilities. Whether it could be successfully 
presented is neither here nor there ; it could be 
presented, undoubtedly, if there were enough 
persons who wished to present it, and it would 
be successful if enough persons were found 
who wished to see it. And as this is about all 
that one could say of any play which had not 
yet made its appearance on the stage, we may 
therefore neglect the question of presentation 
until the play is performed. 

Mr. Moore has written his play almost en- 
tirely in verse, which is not a very common 
thing just now ; in verse which though occa- 
sionally rough, is yet sustained with unflagging 
vitality and spirit, and which by its flowing 
movement and its adaptive character carries 
the reader along with it. He puts aside the 
stillness of a uniform . metre, and as one scene 
changes to another we find the rhythm varying 
harmoniously with the thought. In some places 
he is less fortunate than in others, but on the 
whole the device is eminently successful. And 
although the question of the stage be dismissed, 
it may be allowable to point out, not so much 
that the stage of our day loses something by 
practically excluding verse (Ibsen, Maeter- 
linck, D'Annunzio, Pinero, and, in the main, 
Hauptmann and Sudermann, on the one hand, 
and Rostand and Stephen Phillips on the 
other), as that the verse of a drama generally 
gains by declamation. Mr. Moore's verse may 
be read aloud with pleasure (indeed, should 
be), although here and there it is not so fer- 
vent as elsewhere. 

It is a romantic drama. That might be 
inferred from the adaptive rhythms and the 
rhymes. The clear definiteness of our English 
blank verse gives somewhat the effect of the 
marble material of a statue, unless it be so much 
broken up as to become merely pulsating prose. 
Romantic in form it is and also romantic in 
general treatment, that is, its main idea is pre- 
sented not definitely and simply, but with an 
exuberance of accessory figure and ornament 
that often rather veils the idea than presents 



1901.]

it. Still, the main figures are striking : Joyeux 
the imaginative, and his three coadjutors, the 
scientist, the priest, the poet. These last are 
not presented with a firm enough conception 
of character to vitalize them everywhere, but 
they serve what is perhaps their chief purpose, 
to carry us to the end of the first and long- 
est act and give us the idea that is to be devel- 
oped. The imagination has its ideal, which is 
to be realized in love and at the point of reali- 
zation vanishes away. Rosalys dies and Joyeux 
is, for the time, led away by witch will o' the 
wisps. But in the last act he revives his old- 
time love ; Rosalys rises for a brief half hour, 
and when she again passes away he goes with 
her. 

Presumably Mr. Moore had not definitely 
in mind more than to create certain passionate 
figures and to embody a poetic feeling. Im- 
plicit in such presentation is, however, an idea, 
or perhaps we should not call it more than a 
sentiment. Our attention is aroused and held 
by the ideas that gather in our minds around 
this figure of the imaginative man and his effort 
to 'give form to his imaginings, his strivings 
with the impossible, his deception at the hands 
of vulgar cheats. But whither does all tend ? 
Mr. Moore does not seem to have his problem 
clearly in mind. At least we find no real 
solution. 

But no play should be judged as an allegory 
unless it be frankly conceived as such. This 
play is not : it presents to us romantic figures, 
which do something to arouse ideas in our 
mind as all figures must. But it is better 
merely to take the people as people and to lose 
oneself in the story of emotion and exaltation, 
and to be content with an adumbration here 
and there of the wider meaning beyond. We 
do not, ourselves, fully appreciate the full pur- 
port of the third act. But the poetry of the 
first act especially, and of the last, carried us 
well along over whatever did not make its 
appeal. 

To write a play and in verse is rather a 
daring thing although now there are a num- 
ber to keep one in countenance but Mr. 
Moore has come well through all dangers with 
his venture. EDWABD E. HALE, JR.

SOME RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL.* 



As in this age more people travel, and travel 
more often, and to more distant places, books 
of travel must correspondingly increase. But 
the more be-travelled our sphere the less be- 
comes the opportunity for a really new book 
dealing with the previously unknown and tell- 
ing of strange men and beasts. All the books 
in our present group treat of parts of the earth 
more or less familiar from the writings of pre- 
vious travellers ; yet these books have all of 
them a certain raison d'etre, either in the 
personality of the writer, the timeliness of the 
subject, or the general utility of the whole 
work. 

Mr. G. W. James's hand-book to that won- 
derful region, " In and around the Grand 
Canyon," comes largely under the last head. 
" A canyon," says the author, 
" Is not a deep, narrow, gloomy gorge, into which the 
sun fails to shine even at midday. It is, in reality, a 
series of canyons one within and below the other. Pic- 
ture one canyon, a thousand feet deep and ten or twelve 
miles across; below this, another canyon, but two miles 
less in width and a thousand feet deeper than number 
one; then still another, two thousand feet deeper and 
four miles narrower, followed by yet another, deeper 
still and more miles narrower, until the inner gorge of 
granite is reached, through which the roaring river 
flows, and you will have a better idea than ever before." 

This describes the Grand Canyon, but many 
canyons are by Mr. James's own account nar- 
row and gloomy. After a general description 
of the Colorado region and some historical 
chapters, Mr. James takes up the Grand Can- 
yon and its tributaries in detail. He regards 
the Bridal Veil Falls in the Havasu as the 
"Most exquisitely beautiful waterfall in the world.

There is nothing in the Yosemite that, for rich delicacy 
of beauty and rare combination of charms, can equal it. 
On the left and right are towering cliffs, two thousand 
feet high, of red sandstone. At your feet is rich green 
grass, and a delicate gauzy growth, as fine as asparagus 
grass, which covers the ground with fairy-like lace and 
makes a carpet fit for a ' Midsummer Night's Dream ' 
dance. Above, just on the edge of the fall, are several 
trees, rich with their new dress of spring leaves, with 
the red mountains and azure sky, as richly blue as that 
of the Mediterranean. . . . Now, with such a back- 
ground, enjoy the fall Wa-Hath-peek-ha-ha." 

Mr. James gives some account of the Havasu- 
pai Indians in the canyon district, and an in- 
tensely interesting narrative is given of Mr. 
Bass's experiences in attempting to reach these 
Indians. The work is to be recommended to 
the general reader and to the tourist. The 
quotations are extensive, and the illustrations 
are numerous and excellent. 

Mr. W. E. Curtis has collected his South 
American letters to the Chicago " Record " 
into a volume which he entitles " Between the 
Andes and the Ocean," describing all the west- 
ern countries from Panama to Patagonia. Mr. 
Curtis gives quite a full account of the Panama 
Canal. 

" The advocates of the Panama canal lay great stress 
upon the fact that it has a good harbor at either end, 
capable of receiving the largest ships, while the Nica- 
ragua canal has none, and the two that must be built 
present serious engineering difficulties; that a good 
railroad is now in operation along the entire route of 
the Panama canal, while one will have to be constructed 
in Nicaragua; that the supreme difficulties of the Pan- 
ama route have already been developed and overcome, 
while those of the Nicaragua route are unknown; that 
nothing of an experimental character is proposed on the 
Panama canal, while several projects in the Nicaragua 
scheme involve elements of novelty that are without 
precedent; that the length of the Panama canal is only 
forty-six miles, while that of Nicaragua is four times as 
great; that there are no volcanos on the isthmus, while 
there are several in Nicaragua; that earthquakes are 
practically unknown here, while in Nicaragua they are 
frequent; that the concession from the government of 
Columbia for the Panama canal is complete and satis- 
factory and there is only one nation to deal with, while 
two nations must be consulted in everything that in- 
volves the Nicaragua canal, and the concessions are 
complicated with conditions that are likely to prove 
embarrassing." 

There is some historical matter in Mr. Curtis's 
book, but the main topic treated is the indus- 
trial, social, and political life of the people. 
The volume forms, on the whole, a very read- 
able description of the Western South America 
of to-day. There are a number of illustrations 
and a fair index, but no map. 

" A Summer Journey to Brazil," by Miss 
Alice R. Humphrey, is a brief and pleasant 
record of a trip to Rio Janeiro, Pernambuco, 



Bahia, Petropolis Sanctos, and Sao Paolo. 
The author has some sharp criticism for the 
U. S. consular service at Sanctos, and her 
chapter on this subject ends with this quota- 
tion from a letter written by an American in 
Sao Paolo, dated July 6, 1900 : 

" What does our government mean by sending out 
an Italian Priest as Consul to Santos? If he were only 
a priest who had practically withdrawn from active 
functions, it would not be so bad; but this one makes 
it his first duty to visit the newspapers and declare that 
he will not allow the duties of the consulate to interfere 
with his higher ecclesiastical functions, and as a proof 
of this, he left the duties of the office yesterday and 
came up to say a thirtieth day Mass for the soul of a 
person connected with the Diario Popular,' and had it 
advertised far and near." 

As far as it goes the book is a useful and read- 
able sketch, and contains a number of appen- 
dices of value. 

Under the title " The Paradise of the Pa- 
cific " Mr. G. Waldo Browne gives us a short 
general account of the Hawaiian Islands. The 
volume includes a description of the islands, a 
resume of their history, with special chapters 
on the religious history, and an account of the 
present status. The condition of the Japanese 
and Chinese have particular mention. 

" The Japanese appear to be the disturbing factor in 
the islands at present. There are many educated and 
intelligent Japanese on the islands, who are prominent 
in business and have thrifty homes, but the class most 
largely drawn hither is ignorant, impetuous, and hard 
to control. If industrious they are ambitious, and, see- 
ing better than the Chinese the real inwardness of their 
situation, are dissatisfied with it, waiting, watching for 
the opportunity to strike a blow at the power which at- 
tempts to hold them in check. There is too much of 
the Yankee about them to be held long in surveillance, 
and, with their high percentage of population, what the 
outcome is to be is hard to forecast, though probably 
no cause for serious alarm." 

The book is popular in tone and profusely 
illustrated. 

A companion volume to the book just noticed 
bears the rather fanciful title " The Pearl of 
the Orient." It is a brief compilation of mat- 
ter relating to the Philippine Islands, and while 
popular in tone is fairly accurate on matters of 
fact. There are chapters on the geography 
and history of the islands, on the animals, on 
the resources, and the volume closes with a 
chapter on " America in the Orient." The 
bola or native knife is thus described : 

" The most common type used in warfare is between 
two and three feet in length, including the handle, and 
has a wide, thick blade edged like a guillotine. When 
wielded by a fanatic Philippine in the heat of battle, it 
is a formidable instrument of death, which is capable 
of cutting a human head clear from its seat at a single

blow, split the body from shoulder to hip, or cleave the 
skull in twain. At the call to charge, these native troops 
discard all other weapons and spring to the wild attack 
hand to hand, wielding the bola with terrible effect." 

The illustrations are profuse and well-printed. 

In Miss Christine Collbran's account of " An 
American Girl's Trip to the Orient and around 
the World " we have the fresh impressions of 
a young person conveyed pleasantly enough in 
a very familiar epistolary style. One amusing 
incident the author thus describes : 

" While out walking I met a sort of procession, 
marching down one of the streets of Yokohama, which 
amused me immensely. It consisted of fifteen or twenty 
men carrying long poles with white banners fastened to 
them, or with a mock rooster perched on the top, fol- 
lowed by a brass band of about eight instruments, play- 
ing, or rather trying to play, ' Marching through 
Georgia.' Each man seemed to be playing just as he 
felt, and their laudable endeavors to express their dif- 
ferent moods in different keys was not all that could 
be desired from a musical point of view. Apparently, 
it did not matter in the least if he were a few notes too 
high, or too low, or if he were playing faster or slower 
than the rest; so taking it altogether, I was only just 
able to recognize our good old campaigners' song. The 
Japanese, themselves, seemed to be enjoying it thor- 
oughly, if we may judge by the crowds that followed 
in the wake of this comical band." 

The bulk of the book is given to Japan and 
Korea, other countries receiving but very 
meager notice. 

" Among the Berbers of Algeria," by Mr. 
Anthony Wilkin, is "a popular record of a 
journey undertaken with scientific objects." 
These objects were of an archaeological and 
anthropological nature, the special purpose 
being " to trace if possible their [the Berbers'] 
connection with the most ancient races of 
Egypt by the methods of anthropology, by col- 
lections of pottery, of designs, of physical 
measurements, and by observation of their 
everyday occupations, and of the monuments 
of their ancestors." This object the author 
achieved. The Berbers, unconquered by Roman 
or Arab, but at length subjugated by the 
French, are divided into two tribes, the Chawia 
and Kabylia, both of which were visited by 
our author. He finds the Berber has many 
good traits. 

" Whether in the olive-clad mountains of Kabylia 
or the terraces of their Aurasian fastnesses they are 
white men and in general act like white men. Among 
them the virtues of honesty, hospitality, and good- 
nature are conspicuous. It is not their misfortune 
alone that the lowlands know them no more; not their 
misfortune only that Mohammedanism has debarred 
them from entering, as they would otherwise have en- 
tered, on the path of European progress and liberality: 
it is the misfortune of the whole civilized world. De- 
scendants of a mighty race whose culture once spread 



from the Atlantic to the Red Sea and the Hanran from 
Crete to Timbuctoo and the Soudan, there are still to 
be found among them the vestiges of the arts and 
sciences, of the spirit of conquest, of the capacity for 
self-government, which, if developed, would make them 
again a great nation." 

The book is of interest and value as giving 
us some acquaintance with this little-known 
race. The illustrations are exceptionally fine. 

A pleasant account of that most remote of 
the British Isles, St. Kilda, is prepared by Mr. 
Norman Heathcote. This " last of the sea-girt 
Hebrides " is famed in Britain for its uncouth 
natives and for its multitude of sea-birds. The 
author presents a brief history of St. Kilda, 
followed by chapters on the island as it is to-day, 
boating and climbing experiences, the birds, 
and the " St. Kilda of the future." A curious 
habit of the Fulmar Petrel is thus described ": 

" On the approach of an enemy, the fulmar squirts 
oil at him in self-defense. I suppose the operation is 
of use to them against some of their foes; and though 
it does not avail them against the St. Kildan fowler, 
it is on record that one gallant fulmar succeeded in 
killing a man by this same process. It was not in St. 
Kilda, and it was some time ago. The said man, being 
unacquainted with this little habit of the petrel tribe, 
was so astonished at receiving a stream of nasty-smelling 
oil in his face that he fell off the ladder, by means of 
which he bad obtained access to the nest, and was 
killed. My experience is, that it is a very poor sort of 
weapon, as the range is so short. I doubt if the stream 
of oil will carry more than a couple of feet on the level." 

The illustrations are good, and the author's 
map is probably the best yet made. 

Miss Katharine Lee Bates's " Spanish High- 
ways and Byways " is the vivacious account 
of a tour along the regular routes, the only 
" Byway " being a trip through the Basque 
provinces. The author's impression of the 
Spaniard is that he is not only not lazy, as 
often reputed, but intensely active. She gives 
a graphic picture of a Spanish Carnival. 

" Squeaking and gibbering, the maskers, unrebnked, 
took all manner of saucy liberties. A stately old gen- 
tleman rose from his cushion in a crested carriage to 
observe how gallantly a bevy of ladies were beating off 
with a hail of confetti and bonbons an imploring cav- 
alier who ran by their wheels, and when he would have 
resumed his seat he found himself dandled on the 
knees of a grinning Chinaman. Sometimes a swarm 
of maskers would beset a favorite carriage, climbing 
up beside the coachman and snatching his reins, stand- 
ing on the steps and throwing kisses, lying along the 
back and twitting the proudest beauty in the ear or 
making love to the haughtiest. This all-licensed masker, 
with his monstrous disguise and affected squeal, may 
be a duke or a doorkeeper. Carnival is democracy." 

The book contains a pleasant chapter on the 
gypsies, and one of some length on the Choral 
games of Spanish children, a disquisition which

An enthusiastic, vivacious description of 
Falaise and its environs by an intimate friend 
and observer, may be found in Mrs. Anna 
Bowmon Dodd's volume entitled " Falaise, the 
Town of the Conqueror." The effect of Nor- 
mandy landscape is thus described : 

" Little by little, the subtle and satisfying charm of 
this Normandy landscape was producing an effect not 
wholly new to me, at least. So penetrating have I 
felt this charm to be, that in just such Normandy 
scenes, and just such warm, balmy days, I have had 
that rarest of human sensations, a satisfied, completed 
sense of perfect enjoyment. The man or woman who 
loves nature, sanely, can be made more entirely con- 
tent, I believe, in the rich inland parts of this marvelous 
Normandy province than in any other country." 

The author visited the Falaise Fair in a char- 
a-banc, and in brisk style she narrates the 
scenes there witnessed. A large portion of 
the volume concerns the history of the city. 
We have rarely seen better photographic illus- 
trations than those which adorn this book. 

" Forbidden Paths in the Land of Og " is 
the narrative of a trip by three missionaries 
into the region beyond Jordan. Their expe- 
dition was to the west and north of the Sea of 
Galilee and included visits to Golan, Gadara, 
Mizpah, and Jerash. Of the latter place, 
where are found the ruins of the ancient and 
magnificent Gerasa, the account is quite full 
and interesting. 

" A Greek theatre of the ancient type forms a capital 
camping-place for modern travellers. Historically it 
awakens myriad thoughts of regal splendor and Chris- 
tian martyrdom. Practically it lends itself to the real 
necessities of the tourists in affording shade and shelter, 
semi-seclusion, and excellent stabling for the ani- 
mals. Incongruous as this may sound, a grand 
theatre reduced to the level of tourists' conveniences, 
yet so it was. Camp was pitched in the midst of the 
open arena. Round about on three sides rose the semi- 
circle of stone benches, in sixteen tiers, one above 
another, capable of seating three or four thousand 
spectators." 

The book is full of Biblical allusions, and 
should be of especial use to Bible students.

MR. W. GARRETT BORDER'S " Treasury of American 
Sacred Song " is reissued, in an enlarged edition, by 
Mr. Henry Frowde. Something like thirty new poems 
are included, but the price of the volume has been re- 
duced. The editor gives a broad meaning to the word 
" sacred," and this admirable book is far more than a 
mere collection of hymns. In fact, hymns are rather 
far to seek in these pages. 



WAR AND POLITICS ix SOUTH AFRICA.* 

The wish is father to the thought in nearly all 
recent books which treat of the war in South Africa. 
Two of the group before us are from American 
hands, and attempt to give both sides of the ques- 
tions involved. Several, from English pens, are 
interested only in disclosing what their authors saw. 
The rest are more or less partial to Great Britain, 
reflecting the attitude to be expected when war ex- 
cites a nation. 

The pamphlet from M. Edmond Desmolins, au- 
thor of "Anglo-Saxon Superiority," entitled " Boers 
or English: Who Are in the Right?" is an argu- 
ment against the rights of a weaker people to na- 
tional existence, with such qualification as can be 
given that unpleasant theme by statements such as 
this: "These great nations must understand that 
their preeminence is based solely on the fact that 
they are, for the time being, the most worthy to 
exercise it," a complete confusion, -it will be 
noted, of might and right. 

" The British Case Against the Boer Republics " 
is a small document prepared by the Imperial South 
African Association, chief agent of the Johannes- 
burg mine owners in their campaign of misrepresen- 
tation, which was sent by the Bureau of Education 
to the teachers of the United States during the past 
summer. It is a brief, giving page and volume of 
British official documents, intended to supply the 
British sympathizer with justification for the exter-

initiation of the South African Republics. It is 
purely ex parte, and makes no other pretension. 

Mr. Evelyn Cecil is a nephew of the Marquis 
of Salisbury and a member of parliament. He 
arrived at Cape Town less than a month before the 
war broke oat, and stayed in South Africa for 
three months and a half afterward. The opening 
words of his book, " If England fights she will 
create for herself a sullen dependency among the 
Dutch in South Africa," spoken to the author upon 
his arrival at the Cape, seem to be most nearly 
prophetic of any of the statements in the volume, 
which deals with the British side entirely. Some 
remarks on the administration of Rhodesia are 
worth reading, as evidence that the Transvaal was 
brought to bay for doing the very things which the 
Chartered Company did in a much more extortion- 
ate degree. 

Just such another book as the foregoing, mak- 
ing necessary allowances for sex and education, 
is Miss Violet R. Markham's " South Africa, Past 
and Present." The larger part of the work, how- 
ever, is a rewriting of the history of the land, with 
a chapter on "Industrial Johannesburg" supplied 
by the author's brother, Mr. Arthur Markham. 
The portly volume requires no extended notice at 
this time, containing as it does the usual record of 
mismanagement and race hatred, fostered by mu- 
tual misunderstandings and thoughtless oppor- 
tunism. 

One of the best of the books resulting from the war 
in Cuba was written by Captain George Clarke Mas- 
grave, whose new volume, " In South Africa with 
Buller," contains a vivid account of that doughty 
warrior's advances and retreats. It is a violently 
partisan work, addressed to Americans in a par- 
ticular sense, even to the point of quoting Mr. John 
Hays Hammond, a paid attorney of the Johannes- 
burg mine owners, as an authority, along with a 
number of other Americans with foreign names 
who wish to see England reduce taxation. The 
book makes no pretension to literary graces, but its 
narrative of the fighting can hardly fail to interest. 

Another former Cuban correspondent is Mr. 
John Black Atkins, whose letters to the Manchester 
"Guardian " have been collected, so far as they are 
pertinent, into a volume entitled "The Relief of 
Ladysmith." The story of the repeated attempts 
to bear succor to the people of that sadly beleagnred ' 
and gallant little town is told in Mr. Atkins's best 
style, with great good humor, though with a full 
setting forth of the difficulties met and surmounted. 

Dr. E. Oliver Ashe was a surgeon in the hospital 
at Kimberly daring the siege, and his " Besieged 
by the Boers " is a picturesque account of events in 
that monopolistic town for several months, mottled 
with paragraphs that reflect the deadly dullness of 
the long isolation. Dr. Ashe's vivid pages tell a 
story worth telling, and tell it well. 

The two books of Mr. Winston Spencer Churchill, 
"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria" and "Ian 



Hamilton's March," form a continuous narrative of 
the author's numerous adventures and narrow es- 
capes, from the beginning of the war to the capture 
of Pretoria. The inclusion of the diary of Lieuten- 
ant Frankland, an officer in the unfortunate Dublin 
Fusileers, carries on the tale of the prisoners at 
Pretoria from the time of Mr. Churchill's escape 
until his return to that city with the British column. 
It is not necessary here to praise Mr. Churchill's 
methods of presenting his facts. He is writing in 
the field and his letters appear in a London paper 
before they are printed in book form ; but it is 
doubtful if any revision or care could give them 
the air of reality they now convey. 

Mr. Howard C. Hillegas is an American who has 
been attached to the Republican side in the South 
African struggle. His account of " The Boers in 
War " pays a high tribute to the men who compose 
the burgher armies, and the manner in which they 
go about their battles. He bears witness to the 
smallness of the force which they have been able 
to put in the field, such forces never exceeding 
thirty thousand men at any time, and his descrip- 
tion of what might be called the " elective system " 
of fighting makes it still more surprising that their 
successes should have been what they are. Though 
his sympathies are evidently with the Dutch, Mr. 
Hillegas is wholly free from rancor, as was evi- 
denced in his former book. 

The psychological study of a man changing his 
mind adds to the value of Mr. Richard Harding 
Davis's " With Both Armies in South Africa." It 
is evident from the narrative that Mr. Davis had 
been so thoroughly persuaded the burghers were 
as black as the British had painted them that his 
discovery of the exaggeration caused a total over- 
throw of all his pre-judgments, leaving him as 
violently partisan as before, though on the other 
side. His testimony that the Englishman is a bad 
loser can be matched by an abundance of examples 
collected from exclusively British sources since the 
outbreak of hostilities, and the hearty dislike his 
frankness has caused in Great Britain is some wit- 
ness to the accuracy of his comment. 

Mr. Spencer Wilkinson's volume of " Lessons of 
the War " is merely a reprint of his weekly reviews 
in " The London Letter," and carry the story of 
the war no farther than the relief of Ladysmith. 
His statement that no power will intervene unless 
it is prepared for war still awaits complete demon- 
stration. Another similar volume will contain more 
and riper decisions. 

Even the preface by the Earl of Rosebery does 
not save Mr. H. 0. Arnold-Forster's " The War 
Office, the Army, and the Empire " from being too 
sanguine a work in its belief that strictures on the 
blunders of those who control the machinery of the 
British army will result in reform. Similar rumors 
have been heard in the United States ever since 
Grant found himself powerless to redeem his spe- 
cific pledges to Sherman in behalf of the War

Department against the protests of mere politicians ; 
and the two great Anglo-Saxon powers are too 
desperately proud of proving that they can triumph 
over difficulties to stop to remove any of their own 
making. The author makes out the strongest pos- 
sible case against official incompetents in places 
of power and so did Captain John Bigelow, 
U.S.A., in 1899, concerning the authorities at 
Washington. 

Dr. A. Conan Doyle states the case against him- 
self with entire fairness in the preface to his " The 
Great Boer War." He wrote the somewhat bulky 
volume partly in England and partly on the steamer 
in passage, finishing it in Bloemfontein while pro- 
fessionally engaged during the epidemic among 
the wounded soldiers there. " Often," he says, 
" the only documents which I had to consult were 
the wounded officers and men who were under our 
care." Elsewhere he speaks of the volume being 
" compiled with as much accuracy as is attainable 
at this date." But the history, such as it is, has 
commanded the highest praise in England, and it 
seems to be designed exclusively for British con- 
sumption. Dr. Doyle means to be impartial, and 
there are frequent evidences of his efforts to that 
end. He brings to the book, too, a personal knowl- 
edge of the South African landscape and general 
geography, in addition to his well known skill as a 
writer. 

" The Rise and Fall of Krugerism " bears for 
its sub-title, " A Personal Record of Forty Years 
in South Africa," and Mr. Scoble may be regarded 
as its real author, the position of Mr. Abercrombie 
in the intelligence department of Cape Colony en- 
abling him to eke out the facts which his colabor- 
ator's correspondency for the London " Times " at 
Pretoria put him in the way of acquiring. The 
book is written from the extreme imperialistic point 
of view, and nothing derogatory to the government 
of the Transvaal has been omitted, making it a 
treasure house for the opponents of the Republics. 
But even here the silence of the authors respecting 
the Orange Free State admits away a part of their 
contention. 

Dr. M. J. Farrelly is an advocate of the supreme 
court of Cape Colony, and he is somewhat more 
frank than many of his countrymen in setting forth 
the nature of the struggle. " We are fighting," he 
says, " in order to place a small international oli- 
garchy of mine owners and speculators in power at 
Pretoria [what Kruger was fighting to avoid]. En- 
glishmen will surely do well to recognize that the 
economic and political destinies of South Africa 
are, and seem likely to remain, in the hands of men, 
most of whom are foreigners by origin, whose trade 
is finance, and whose trade interests are not chiefly 
British." Dr. Farrelly looks for a period of duress 
as a Crown colony for the Transvaal and, probably, 
the Free State, and regards time as the only solu- 
tion of most of the existing difficulties. 

WALLACE RICE. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



O'Connell, 
the Irish 
Liberator. 



The Daniel O'Connell of Mr. Robert 
Dunlop's presentation, in the " He- 
roes of the Nations " series (Put- 
nam), is a genuine Irishman, somewhat unduly 
spiritualized it may be, yet typical of his race. 
Mercurial in temperament, quick to take offense 
and quick to forgive, easily quarrelsome over triv- 
ialities, he is still the foremost figure in the long 
list of the Irish agitators of the earlier part of the 
century. O'Connell was a leader of the Irish bar, 
an eloquent orator, and an effective member of 
Parliament, but it is upon his abilities as an organ- 
izer of political societies for the redress of Ireland's 
grievances that Mr. Dunlop justly places the greatest 
stress. He excelled his contemporaries in his ability 
legally to evade repressive laws, and he stood far 
above every other agitator of the period in his de- 
termination never to encourage violent methods 
for the repeal of obnoxious statutes. O'Connell 
always advocated " constitutional " agitation. Mon- 
ster petitions, public meetings, and far-reaching 
political associations were the instruments he chose 
to express Ireland's sentiments, in the hope that 
incessant iteration would ensure fair treatment for 
his countrymen. Revolution was hateful to him. 
Neither personal persecution, nor discouragement 
at the seeming failure of wisely conceived projects, 
moved him, for an instant, from his horror of in- 
surrectionary methods. Mr. Dunlop insists upon 
this again and again, for O'Connell has frequently 
been credited with the will, but not with the courage, 
to embroil Ireland in civil war, and during his 
lifetime was generally regarded in England as 
hypocritical in his denunciation of armed resistance. 
Yet Mr. Dunlop's estimate is sustained by numer- 
ous quotations from O'Connell's personal letters to 
intimate friends, at every stage of his career. 
O'Connell's character and acts were by no means 
above criticism, and the author does not attempt to 
conceal the defects. He was an egoist, yet perhaps 
purposely so in politics, recognizing the aptitude of 
his countrymen for submission to the political 
" boss." He made serious mistakes in policy, as 
when he favored the disfranchisement of the forty 
shilling freeholders. He was often vulgar and 
abusive in language toward his political opponents. 
These failings are noted explicitly, though usually 
with toleration, by Mr. Dunlop. Yet Council's 
greatest mistake, in the author's opinion, was one 
of judgment and not of character or measure, 
briefly, that his whole scheme of operations, though 
successful in securing Catholic emancipation, was 
based upon ideals, thus rendering complete success 
impossible. O'Connell believed that when once 
England was educated to understand the wrongs 
of the existing government of Ireland, the English 
sense of justice would force the righting of these 
wrongs. He therefore educated England by agi- 
tation in Ireland. Mr. Dunlop asserts that England

has never acted toward Ireland upon principles of 
abstract justice, and that selfish interest alone has 
brought any alleviation of Irish distress. Mere 
agitation of principles of right are here, therefore, 
always useless unless England sees her own direct 
benefit in their realization. Mr. Dunlop is an 
Englishman. - 

In "Sleeping Beauty and Other 
p roge Fancie8 /j oh " n Lane ) Mr> 

. j . * 

Richard Le Galuenne gives us a 
series of short essays written in the brilliant vein 
that holds attention if it does not always produce 
conviction. Mr. Le Gallienne is a devotee of the 
religion of beauty, and in the fervor of his devotion 
he says, " Why not disendow the Church, and en- 
dow Literature, which is really the coming Church?" 
His militant faith in the triumph of the finer in- 
stincts of the soul, love of beauty and desire for 
truth, and longing for the invisible things of the 
spirit, is abundantly in evidence, and especially so 
in the most important essay in the book, "The 
Second Coming of the Ideal." He insists upon the 
reality of dreams, and declares that realism has 
failed because it does not understand, as does 
idealism, the science of human nature. Eager and 
earnest as are Mr. Le Gallienne's convictions, he 
manages to give them publicity without too much 
parade of importance, dwelling upon them lovingly 
rather than strenuously, and even touching them 
lightly with a graceful fancy and a mild sort of wit. 
His treatment of Mr. Stephen Phillips has the 
charm of absolute sincerity of appreciation, and 
this paper more than any other makes us realize 
how much of our pleasure in the volume comes 
from the genuineness of his fresh delight in the 
aesthetic charm of books and men. But his enjoy- 
ment of Stevenson, and Theodore Watts-Dun ton, 
and Miss Custance is balanced by the very positive 
irritation that comes to him from the great popular 
success of Rndyard Kipling. "Mr. Kipling has 
chosen to make the clay jig, instead of compelling 
the marble to sing; and he has his reward," he 
says, ^A Propos The Absent-Minded Beggar," 
and. while we may not sympathize with his feeling 
of personal vexation, we must allow the criticism. 
On the whole, while there are some good things 
well said in the book, it is an entertaining rather 
than weighty or valuable contribution to the literary 
discussion of the problems of art and life. It 
might be suggested to Mr. Le Gallienne that his 
work is sufficiently pretentious to warrant his giving 
a little more attention to the writing of correct 
English. Especially is this desirable if he is to go 
forth to battle with Mr. Kipling as one who degrades 
the national literature by the use of slang. 

A commendable Information in regard to memory is 
compendium a matter of general interest, and 

descriptions of the peculiarities and 
vagaries of the venerable mother of the muses may 
frequently be overheard in the small talk of culti- 
vated persons. Exact information in regard to the 



psychological status of the memory-processes is cer- 
tainly desirable ; and on the whole such information 
has kept pace with the increasing knowledge in 
regard to the physiological and psychological basis 
and mode of development of mental functions. 
Professor Colegrove's inductive study of " Memory" 
(Holt) is a well-designed aid to the student of this 
topic, and will appeal to the interests of the general 
reader. The scope of the volume includes an intro- 
ductory chapter giving the historical setting of 
opinions in regard to the nature of memory ; a 
suggestive account of the fluctuations of the memory- 
functions in the biological world ; some description 
of the diseases of memory, without which a con- 
ception of memory would be both misleading and 
inadequate ; a brief statement of the connection of 
memory-processes with the functions of the brain ; 
a discussion of the significant types, or classes of 
memory ; a detailed study, on the basis of an ex- 
tensively circulated question-sheet, of certain special 
problems in regard to the tenacity, accuracy, di- 
rection, unfoldment, relation to age, sex, race, etc., 
and other characteristics of individual memories ; 
a discussion of the relations of the mere retentive 
functions to the assimilative ones, particularly to 
attention, apperception, and association ; and a 
concluding chapter rehearsing the pedagogical ap- 
plications of the main results of the previous studies. 
The volume is the outcome of a deep personal in- 
terest and of a special investigation of the subject. 
Its essential defect is the lack of a sustained hold 
upon the relations of the different parts of the 
subject to one another. We have a series of inci- 
dents, where we expect a continued story involving 
the same characters but in new situations. It is 
true of memory as of many problems psychological, 
that " what was a problem once is a problem still "; 
but an interesting sketch of the shape which the 
problem assumes in response to the activities of 
modern research may be profitably gained from 
Dr. Colegrove's handbook. 

" The history of our navy under 
steam divides itself into two parts, 
rather sharply separated by a pe- 
culiar war-vessel forced into the field of action in 
advance of its natural time by the demands of a 
great war, and destined suddenly to change by its 
example the naval armaments and methods of all 
nations." This sentence indicates the underlying 
thought in " The Monitor and the Navy under 
Steam " (Hough ton), by Lieut. Frank M. Bennett, 
IT. S. N. The story of the origin and progress of 
steam navigation is told in a very interesting way, 
a number of drawings helping materially in giving 
the reader a correct understanding of the successive 
advance steps. A second chapter recounts the 
famous duel between the " Monitor " and the 
" Merrimac," and this is followed by a description 
of other naval actions of the Civil War, the upper- 
most thought always being the evolution of the 
modern battle-ship. After the Civil War the United

States " practically dropped out of sight for twenty 
years as a naval or maritime power," and European 
nations made the experiments and perfected the 
machinery necessary to the building of the battle- 
ship of to-day. This naval indifference was trying 
to American officers, and yet had its compensations, 
since we were able, when our " new navy " was 
planned, to profit by the expensive experience of 
the rest of the world. What the new navy accom- 
plished in the Spanish-American War of course is 
set forth in glowing words, nearly a hundred pages 
out of three hundred and fifty being given to the 
events of 1898. This may perhaps be criticised 
as an undue proportion, but it is true that the story 
is designed to approach such a climax, all the 
thought and inventions of the past being represented 
at their best in such a vessel as the " Oregon." 
The last chapter will be depended upon to sell the 
book, but it is likely that more real value attaches 
to the earlier pages, which show how naval inventors 
worked unceasingly at ideas tending to make the 
ships move faster than sails could carry them, and 
at the same time to make a more solid barrier for 
the flag at sea than was afforded by the " wooden 
walls " of the old navy. 

In his careful and engrossing work 
* io ? yo S on "The Frigate Constitution, the 

" Old Irotitides." _, , _. , , _ 

Central rigure of the Wavy under 
Sail" (Houghton), Mr. Ira N. Hollis follows the 
fortunes of " Old Ironsides " from her inception 
under the presidency of Washington to her present 
condition of honorable old age, in which she is 
soon to enjoy a pension adequate for her main- 
tenance in ease and dignity. With the part in 
history played by the "Constitution" Americans 
have every reason to be satisfied. If she did 
not win her spurs a most terrestrial trope, in 
this connection during the Jbrief war with France, 
she did beat an English frigate sailing at that 
time, and Preble gave her plenty to do against 
the Tripolitans soon after. It was in 1812 that 
the gallant ship blossomed into her fulness of fame, 
and Mr. Hollis does not exaggerate when he says 
she " was the single champion of a young and 
struggling nation " in a war which " terminated 
the period of our dependence upon England." 
Thrice escaping from British fleets by exhibitions 
of resourcefulness which still thrill the heart, and 
thrice victorious over British ships-of-war, the 
" Guerrie're," the "Java," and the "Cyene" and 
" Levant," the career of the " Constitution " 
furnishes almost enough material for an epic. The 
book is always readable and frequently fascinating.

which his theme suggests. His book, in short, is a 
good plain narrative of Oliver's career, and a sen- 
sible, unexaggerated view of his character. Mr. 
Paterson inclines to take issue with writers who 
regard Cromwell's later usurpations as an apostasy 
from the cause of political liberty, and endeavors 
with some plausibility to show that his high-handed 
measures were largely forced on him by circum- 
stances (which we believe to be in a measure true), 
and, moreover, that in taking such measures he really 
acted as the instrument or mandatary of his council 
(which we believe to be exceedingly doubtful). 
Mr. Paterson's book is very readable, and it sets 
forth concisely, in a compact, well-made volume, the 
essentials of Cromwell's history. There are two 
well-executed portraits, one of them a likeness of 
the Protector's mother after a rare original. 

Before the outbreak of hostilities in 

The Forward g outQ Africa, tne que8 tion that most

interested political England was the 
so-called " Forward Policy " in India, and whether 
the Afridi war was a logical result of that policy. 
Under the guise of a personal memoir, Mr. Richard 
I. Bruce, a former political agent in Beluchistan, 
has written a book of comment upon English action 
in India. " The Forward Policy and Its Results " 
(Longmans) relates the chief activities of its author, 
and defends the system introduced by Sir Robert 
Sandemann, in bringing under English control 
some of the frontier tribes between Northwest India 
and Afghanistan. The question at issue is as to 
whether it is wiser to accustom the wild Pathans of 
this border to submit to English intervention in 
their disputes, and to permit the establishment of 
semi-military outposts, or to leave them absolutely 
independent in the hope that such a policy will 
assure their friendship in case of a Russian advance 
on India. Mr. Bruce is emphatically in favor of 
the Forward Policy as opposed to the Close Border 
Policy. Every new government in India, he says, 
has entered office with the determination to check 
further advance toward Afghanistan, but has been 
forced by the necessity of the situation to alter its 
purpose. He advocates a peaceable, friendly, non- 
military advance, to be made on principle and not 
grudgingly, and cites his own and Sir Robert 
Sandemann's labors among the Harris and Bugtis 
in proof that such an advance is possible. He is 
not a forcible writer, and indeed makes no pretense 
at literary merit, but trusts to the reiteration of 
specific facts in Indian history to substantiate his 
argument. As a personal memoir the book is not

interesting, for the description of frontier incident 
and life has been sacrificed to the narrative of petty 
political events. It will be of value to those Amer- 
ican readers who care to know tho conditions of 
government on this thousand-mile frontier of India. 
Many fine photographs of men and places accom- 
pany the text, and an excellent map is inserted at 
the end. 

During the last ten years, a great deal 
The Germant in o f attent i O n has been paid by special 

Colonial timet. . f. J 

students of American history to what 
may be called the minor race elements of Colonial 
times, and long delayed protests have been increas- 
ingly frequent against that method of history- 
writing which ascribes all the virtues of Colonial 
days to the English settlers and finds small place 
for mention of representatives of other blood who 
helped to build the United States. " The Germans 
in Colonial Times " (Lippincott), by Miss Lucy For- 
ney Bittinger, is the latest of these protests, a com- 
pact little volume of three hundred pages, into 
which is crowded a vast amount of interesting in- 
formation regarding the early German immigrants. 
The conditions in the homeland which led to the 
movement of population are shown, a religious 
condition and a social one, aud then, step by step 
and colony by colony, the author describes the 
various German bodies, many of them small relig- 
ious sects, Mennonites, Bunkers, Salzburgers, Mo- 
ravians and the like, who settled here and there 
from Maine to Georgia, called locally " Pennsyl- 
vania Dutch," and yet having many common char- 
acteristics wherever found. The trials and tribu- 
lations of these immigrants are clearly shown, one 
interesting chapter being on the " Redemptioners," 
in which it appears that the lot of an indented 
servant was often a hard one. A chronological 
table shows that the German influence was mani- 
fested for exactly a century before the treaty of 
Paris of 1783, the first company, the one which 
located at Germantown, coming in 1683. A quite 
extensive bibliography indicates wide reading. The 
writer undoubtedly performed a labor of love in 
the preparation of her material, and her heart was 
full of desire to make the best case for her friends. 
Naturally there are some faults due to over-enthu- 
siasm, and in some places the book lacks exact 
references and foot-notes, but it is none the less a 
welcome addition to the literature of Colonial times, 
and a valuable handbook regarding one important 
race-element in our cosmopolitan national character. 

In his preface to Miss C. A. Button's 
interesting monograph on " Greek 
Terracotta Statuettes " (Macmillan) 
Dr. A. S. Murray, keeper of classical antiquities in 
the British Museum, states that, while anyone with 
the slightest artistic perception can enjoy the beauty 
of these dainty figurines, it is needful to share in 
Miss Button's unusual erudition if one is to step 
beyond this, and understand how they were made, 
and when, and where, and why. To these questions 



A ttudy of 
Greek terracotta

the author returns no uncertain answer. Not only 
is the whole secret of the ancient manufacturers 
laid bare to the most casual reader, but such recon- 
dite matters as changes of coloring, and changes in 
dress and style, are made plain. To do this, it was 
needful to reproduce a number of typical figurines 
in both monotint and color, and these numerous 
illustrations add immensely to the value of the book. 
Many of the statuettes owe their birth to the period 
which gave us the immortal bits of the anthology, 
and the treasures of that work have been drawn 
upon by Miss Button for mutual comparison and 
elucidation, with the happiest results. Such a book 
has long been needed for general reference, and it 
is to be hoped that it may yet be re-issued in less 
expensive and more popular form. 

A wtitiionary- The sudden and vigorous growth of 
statesman of that young nation of the Pacific, 

Japan, was due to many causes not 
popularly known. One of these was the presence 
in that land, at critical moments, of sturdy and 
level-headed foreigners. Dr. William Elliot Griffis 
in his " Verbeck of Japan : A Citizen of No Coun- 
try " (Revell) has opened our eyes to see one of 
those characters. Dr. Guido F. Verbeck entered 
Japan in 1859 and gave nearly forty years of his 
life to the Japanese. He went out as a missionary, 
but his success as a teacher, his wisdom as a man of 
affairs, and his influence as an adviser, soon secured 
for him unwonted power with those in authority in 
the dawn of Japan's modern history. A number 
of the chief authorities of state in the young gov- 
ernment had been his former pupils and wisely 
looked upon him as their best adviser ; so that 
when the constitution of the country was finally 
cast, Dr. Verbeck was probably next to the dictator 
of its articles. Then, too, the educational policy 
of Japan, and its relation to foreign culture, to the 
arts and sciences, was largely shaped by the wis- 
dom of this same Americanized Dutchman. Dr. 
Griffis has given us a noble portrait of this devoted 
missionary-statesman, who molded in a very definite 
manner the new empire of the Pacific.

greed in the struggle between the North and the 
South, and turned the popular English derision of 
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation into mighty 
mass-meetings of praise to the Divine Providence 
which had rid the world of its greatest curse. Eliza- 
beth Pease was born in 1807, was married to Pro- 
fessor John Pringle Nichol in 1853, and died soon 
after her ninetieth birthday, in 1897. She was of 
Quaker lineage, and consecrated almost from birth

to the cause of the hopeless and oppressed, an an- 
nointing which she never forgot. The story of her 
long and noble life, with its eager sympathy and 
deep devotion to immutable truths, is well-told in 
Mrs. Stoddard's volume. 



Pleasant essays 
on familiar t/iemet. 



We are glad to be lectured gently 
on our follies and vanities and on 
things having to do in general with 
the old subject of the conduct of life, when the 
teaching to which we must listen is as genial and 
kindly, as full of a simple and wholesome wisdom, 
as is that of Mr. Edward Sandford Martin's " Lucid 
Intervals " (Harper). The chapters on " Children," 
" Swains and Damsels," " Husbands and Wives," 
"Education," "Riches," and the five more that 
make up the book are devoted to the comfortable 
optimism of a man who has known how to accept 
things as they are and be happy. The subjects 
touched upon are old and the possibility of saying 
anything new upon them does not promise much, 
but the racy freshness of treatment, and the pleas- 
antly pervasive quality of the author's personality, 
gives them new color and interest. The book has 
a goodly number of taking illustrations and is at- 
tractively bound. 

The Colonial woman, as an object 
of interest to her bustling and am- 
bitious descendants, is still having 
her innings, and therefore the pretty volume entitled 
" Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days " (Crow- 
ell), by Miss Geraldine Brooks, will doubtless find 
favor with readers of books of its class. It contains 
ten simply-written sketches of notable women, the 
list beginning with the "first of American club 
women," Anne Hutchinson, and closing with Sally 
Wister, of Pennsylvania, a charming Quakeress 
whose life, says Dr. Weir Mitchell, "must have 
been a joy to itself and others." The characters 
chosen for treatment collectively represent a wide 
territorial range, and the flavor of the short story 
imparted to the sketches will commend them to 
readers in quest of entertainment. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The finest craft of the bookmaker is exhibited in the 
latest volume by " E. V. B.," entitled " Sylvana's Let- 
ters to an Unknown Friend " (Macmillan). The paper 
is of the best, the print is large and enticing to the eye, 
and photographic illustrations are lavishly interspersed 
with the letter-press. The delights of gardening are 
the prolific theme of the writer, who has means and 
leisure to indulge to the utmost her taste for floriculture. 
A gentle sympathy follows her record of the flowers 
that pass in lovely procession through the fertile months 
of the year. A little more life and warmth in her 
descriptions would relieve them of a possible accusation 
of monotony. 

The Oxford University Press have published an 
" Anthology of French Poetry," including examples all 
the way down from the tenth century to the last, trans- 



lated by Dean Henry Carrington. We need not in this 
connection discourse upon the necessary limitations of 
verse translation, for they are well understood. What 
is important to say is that the present translator is 
thoroughly familiar with his material, and that the deft 
poetical touch of his versions is often remarkable. His 
range is wide, and almost every French lyrist of im- 
portance is represented by one or more examples. 

"The Foundations of Botany," by Mr. Joseph Y. 
Bergen, is a text-book published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 
It is written upon the general plan of the author's 
earlier "Elements of Botany," but gives greatly in- 
creased attention to laboratory work and the study of 
cryptogams. The text proper occupies upwards of 
four hundred pages, and to this is appended a " Key and 
Flora" of two hundred and fifty pages more. In the 
latter section about seven hundred species, wild and 
cultivated, are included, which makes such an appendix 
really worth while. The directions for experimental 
work are abundant and explicit, and the volume has 
hundreds of illustrations in the text, besides a dozen 
or so full-page plates. The book is thoroughly scien- 
tific in method, and presents the subject in the most 
attractive way. 

Mr. W. H. Mallock has tried an interesting experi- 
ment, although one not brought to a particularly happy 
issue, in his little book entitled " Lucretius on Life and 
Death in the Metre of Omar Khayyam." The similarity 
of spirit between the Persian and the Roman poet is 
sufficient to justify this effort, but if there be some 
suggestions of the unsophisticated Omar in Mr. Mai- 
lock's quatrains, there is nothing of the peculiar quality 
that FitzGerald gave to his immortal paraphrase. Mr. 
Mallock has produced about a hundred quatrains, and 
has appended the original texts upon which they are 
based. Mr. John Lane publishes the volume. 

Mr. John Kenyon Kilbourn has compiled a volume 
on the "Faiths of Famous Men in their Own Words" 
(Henry T. Coates & Co.), which shows vast industry 
but less judgment. Of its ten chapters, four are upon 
the Millenium, the Intermediate State, the Resurrec- 
tion, and Heaven, although only about a third of the 
book itself is given to these subjects. The famous men 
who write upon such subjects are somewhat unknown. 
Grover Cleveland, it is true, is quoted under the Mil- 
lenium, but his words have to do with the disarmament 
of nations. Indeed, the author has a most catholic 
estimate of fame and has admitted many men mostly 
clergymen of whom the careless world has little 
heard. Yet, the volume is full of interest, and we doubt 
not will serve a useful purpose in furnishing preachers 
with apt quotations. 

The admirable series of "Beacon Biographies" is 
being supplemented by a similar series of small volumes 
called the " Westminster Biographies " (Small, May- 
nard & Co.), dealing with prominent Englishmen. The 
two volumes upon John Wesley by Mr. Frank Banfield 
and Adam Duncan, Lord Camperdown, by Mr. H. L. 
Wilson, are good illustrations of what biographical 
sketches should be. The problems facing the two 
writers were precisely opposite. The material at hand 
for the biography of Wesley is voluminous, while in 
the case of Duncan it is strangely scauty. Each author, 
however, maintains the perspective of his subject's 
life and has incidentally given us a good many side- 
lights upon the England of their day. This historical 
treatment is especially prominent in Mr. Wilson's 
sketch of Duncan.

NOTES. 



Two " Lark Classics " are the sonnets of Shakespeare 
and a selection from the lyrics of Mr. Swinburne. They 
are trim little volumes published by Mr. Doxey, New 
York. 

The Chicago " Daily News Almanac " for 1901, com- 
piled, as for many years past, by Mr. George E. Plumbe, 
has just been sent to us, and is a welcome addition to 
the reference shelf. 

" The Rigveda," by Mr. E. Vernon Arnold, is a new 
pamphlet in the series of popular studies in mythology, 
romance, and folklore which Mr. David Nntt has been 
publishing from time to time. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sous publish a third edition, 
considerably enlarged, of " Cabin and Plantation Songs 
as Sung by the Hampton Students." A few Indian 
songs are also comprised within the collection. 

" The Book Hunter," by Mr. John Hill Burton, is a 
bibliographical classic that needs no description at 
this late day. The J. B. Lippincott Co. have just repub- 
lished the work in an edition that is both neat and inex- 
pensive. 

" Rouen," by the Rev. Thomas Perkins, and " Char- 
tres," by Mr. H. J. L. J. Mass*;, are the two most 
recent additions to the series of " Bell's Handbooks to 
Continental Churches," issued in this country by the 
Macmillan Co. 

"A New Greek Method," by Mr. William James 
Seelye, comes to us from the Herald Printing Co., 
Wooster, Ohio. It is a modest little book, intended to 
provide beginners with as short a cut as possible to 
their "Anabasis." 

" Moore's Meterological Almanac and Weather 
Guide " for 1901, is published by Messrs. Rand, Mc- 
Nally & Co. It bears the name of Professor Willis L. 
Moore, but we marvel that he should have authorized 
so unscientific a title. 

Two volumes of biographical and critical interest, 
to be issued shortly by Mr. M. F. Mansfield of New 
York, are a life of Samuel Richardson, by Miss Clara 
L. Thomson, and an account of " J. M. Barrie and his 
Books," by Mr. J. A. Hammerton. 

Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co. call our attention 
to the fact that their " Nuttall Encyclopaedia," recently 
mentioned in these pages as " reissued," is an absolutely 
new work, although the title-page does not make this 
altogether clear. We cheerfully make the desired cor- 
rection. 

Professor T. N. Toller's " Outlines of the History of 
the English Language," published by the Macmillan 
Co., is a serviceable text-book for students, whether in 
or out of school. It is essentially a treatise on Old 
English, although three chapters are devoted to the 
Middle and Modern periods. 

Professor Simon Newcomb's " Elements of Astron- 
omy," published by the American Book Co., is a small 
book but a comprehensive one. It is particularly well- 
fitted for use in such high schools and academies as are 
unable to devote more than a three or four months' 
course to the subject of astronomy. 

The removal to New York of Professors Trent and 
Wells has devolved the editorial conduct of "The 
Sewanee Review" upon new hands. The work will 
now be taken up by Professors Henneman and Ramage, 
of Sewanee, and we have no fear that they will do any- 



thing to lower the high standard already achieved by 
this valuable quarterly, which is just entering upon its 
ninth annual volume. 

" The Stories of My Four Friends " is a little book 
of nature studies for children, left in manuscript by the 
late Jane Andrews, and now prepared for publication 
by her sister, Mrs. Margaret Andrews Allen. This 
small volume, pleasantly written and charmingly illus- 
trated, is published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

The American branch of the Oxford University Press 
has arranged with the Rev. F. N. Peloubet, D.D., 
author of " Peloubet's Select Notes on the International 
Lessons," to issue a Teachers' Commentary on the New 
Testament. The work will be complete in ten volumes, 
the first of which, a Commentary on Matthew, will be 
issued at once. 

" The Etiquette of Correspondence," by Miss Helen 
E. Gavit, is a publication of the A. Wessels Co. From 
it one may learn how to write properly all kinds of let- 
ters, and obtain at the same time much useful informa- 
tion respecting such incidental matters as heraldry, 
postal regulations, the use of abbreviations, and of for- 
eign words and phrases. 

" On Southern Poetry prior to 1860," by Mr. Sidney 
Ernest Bradshaw, is a doctoral dissertation presented 
to the University of Virginia. It is a conscientious 
piece of investigation, and adds one more stone to the 
cairn to which the twentieth century historian of our 
American literature will have recourse when he lays 
the foundations of his work. 

" The Historical Development of Modern Europe," 
by Dr. Charles M. Andrews, has now been before the 
public for three or four years, and has approved itself 
to judicious students of history. Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons now reissue the work, two volumes in one, and 
call it a " student's edition." There are nearly a thous- 
and pages in the volume, and the price is moderate. 

" A Short History of French Literature," by Messrs. 
L. E. Kastner and H. G. Atkins, is published by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. It provides a convenient manual 
for examination candidates, and at the same time a 
readable conspectus of the whole of French literature, 
down to the latest (or next to the latest) of the decadent 
writers of to-day. These closing chapters, indeed, while 
the most questionable, will probably be found the most 
useful in the book, for it is not always easy to obtain 
even such meagre information as is here offered con- 
cerning the French poets and novelists of the younger 
school. 

Following up the edition of Dante's " Paradise " 
issued in the series of " Temple Classics " (Macmillan) 
a few months ago, we now have the "Inferno" in sim- 
ilar satisfactory form. The Italian text and the well- 
known translation of Dr. John Aitken Carlyle are 
presented on alternate pages, with the necessary edito- 
rial material supplied by Mr. H. Oelsner. Other vol- 
umes in the same series that have come to us during 
the past few weeks include Vol. VII. of Caxton's 
"Golden Legend," Vols. IV. and V. of Macaulay's 
Essays, Vol. III. in Mr. F. S. Ellis's edition of " The 
Romance of the Rose," and Vols. IV. to VIII. in Mr. 
A. B. Hinds's translation of Vasari's Lives, com- 
pleting all four of these editions. Last of all may be 
mentioned the reprints of La Motte Fouque"s " Sin- 
tram " and " Aslauga's Knight," with illustrations by 
Mr. Charles Robinson, and Miss Mitford's " Our Vil- 
lage."

SCRIBNER'S NEW BOOKS 



TEN MONTHS A CAPTIVE AMONG FILIPINOS 

Being a Narrative of Adventure and Observation during Imprisonment on the 

Island of Luzon. 

By ALBERT SONNICHSEN. With Portrait. 8vo, $2.00. 

A PECULIARLY interesting account of an extraordinary experience. The story of the author's 
** imprisonment in the insurgent capital, his captivity during the retreat northward, his trials in a native 
hospital, and his final escape is told with remarkably genuine and convincing effect. Incidentally, there 
is a flood of fresh and novel light on the Filipino character. 



MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY By Professor F. MAX MULLER 
With Portraits. 8vo, $2.00. 

A WORK of the deepest interest, in which the famous Oxford scholar describes his career from his 
* earliest youth. He dwells with especial particularity upon the effect of environment upon his life, 
including in that phrase friends and circumstances. The intimate personal charm of the book is great. 



THE HISTORICAL NOVEL, AND OTHER ESSAYS 

By BRANDER MATTHEWS. 12mo, $1.50. 

DROFESSOR MATTHEWS'S keen and illuminative insight into the personality of writers and into 
questions of literature appears at its best in this series of essays on literary subjects, both general and 
personal in character. His discussion of " The Historical Novel," of " Romance against Romanticism," 
and of " The Study of Fiction," will be found of the first interest and value to the student of fiction. 



MASTERS OF FRENCH LITERATURE 

By GEORGE M. HARPER, Professor in Princeton University. 12mo, $1.50. 
DROFESSOR HARPER has furnished in these careful and penetrating studies of the great French 
writers a survey of French literature as a whole, the place of which among the literatures of the 
world he also discriminatingly determines in an essay devoted to that special subject. The book is the 
manifest result of profound study and prolonged reading, and its views of the giants of French prose and 
poetry are marked by candor and intelligent sympathy altogether unusual in the criticism of the foreigner. 



THE OPERA, PAST AND PRESENT By w. F. APTHORP 

(Music Lover's Library.) With Portraits. 12mo, $1.25 net. 

A CLEAR and connected account of the establishment and gradual evolution of the Opera as an art, 
especially as regards the inter-relation and effect upon each other of the different schools, composers, 
and epoch-making works. The book has the distinction and the authoritative quality attaching to every- 
thing Mr. Apthorp writes.

THE LIFE AND LITERATURE OF THE ANCIENT HEBREWS 

By LYMAN ABBOTT, D.D., author of " The Life and Letters of Paul the Apostle," 
" The Evolution of Christianity," etc. Crown 8vo, gilt top, $2.00. 

Doctor Abbott's object in this book is to trace in the Bible the origin and development of the religious, 
political, and literary life of the ancient Hebrews, on the theory that this life was a gradual development 
like that of other nations. His treatment of the Bible is free yet wholly reverent, and his book is of un- 
common interest and value. 

THE NEW EPOCH FOR FAITH 

By GEORGE A. GORDON, D.D., author of " The Christ of To-Day," " The Witness to 

Immortality," etc. 12mo, $1.50. 

This book is an uncommonly fresh and valid contribution to the best kind of modern religious liter- 
ature. It is an interpretation of the religious conditions of to-day from the point of view of a progressive 
thinker. Doctor Gordon assumes as clearly true that the direction of religious development for the past 
twenty years has been toward a freer and fuller faith. His work, while carefully discriminating, is dis- 
tinctly optimistic, and is written with remarkable literary power and charm. 

THE TURN OF THE ROAD 

A Komance. By EUGENIA BROOKS FROTHINGHAM. 12 mo, $1.50. 

The romance of a singer who through love finds her soul. The hero is a loyal, high-minded American, 
and a thorough gentleman ; the heroine is an ambitious, self-reliant American girl. She studies in Paris, 
and becomes a very accomplished singer, and, after the experience of devotion and self-denial of the hero, 
becomes a superb woman. The story is effectively told, and merits a wide popularity. 

A PILLAR OF SALT. By JENNETTE LEE. 12mo, $1.25. 

A story of an inventor's genius and the opposition to his ambition and enthusiasm by the inventor's 
wife. The invention succeeds the story of its success, after much disquiet, is powerfully told, and the 
emotional interest of the story is very strong.

35,000 copies of the " Great Boer 
War," by A. Conan Doyle, have been 
sold in England. Two editions have 
been exhausted in this country and 
the sale is rapidly increasing. 

The original copy of "Lincoln: 
His Book," published in facsimile 
by McClure, Phillips & Co., has 
been acquired by Colonel William 
H. Lambert, of Philadelphia, who 
has the largest collection of Lin- 
colniana in existence. 

Reviews of "The Trust Problem," 
by Prof. Jenks, have been made in 
French, German, Austrian, English, 
Italian, Spanish, Australian, and 
Chinese papers. The publishers, 
McClure, Phillips & Co., will go to 
press shortly with the fourth edition. 

In his recent report, President 
Schurman, of the Philippine Com- 
mission, called " Noli Me Tangere " 
the Bible of the Filipinos, and its 
author, Dr. Jose Rizal, the greatest 
Filipino who ever lived. " Noli Me 
Tangere " has been translated into 
English under the title, " An Eagle 
Flight," and is published by Mc- 
Clure, Phillips & Co. 

Among the early February publi- 
cations will be Ida M. Tarbell's 
" Napoleon and Josephine," a new 
and revised edition of her " Napo- 
leon," which reached a sale of nearly 
100,000 copies. The same elaborate 
illustrations will be preserved in the 
forthcoming edition, which has been 
supplemented and enlarged through 
the addition of a sympathetic sketch 
of Josephine. 

Within a week McClure, Phillips 
& Co. will publish "The Encyclo- 
paedia of Etiquette," compiled by 
Emily Holt, which is said to cover 
the entire subject of what to do, 
what to say, what to write, what to 
wear. The volume is illustrated by 
reproductions of specially posed 
photographs, and is claimed to be 
the most complete book of manners 
for every-day use ever published. 

" A little plain, ordinary, common 
sense on the subject of the criminal 
and his relation to the social system is 
not unwelcome," says the New York 
Sun, " and the reader will find it in a 
series of stories of the under-world 
under the title Powers That Prey' by 
Josiah Flynt and Francis Walton." 



An Important Historical Book Now Ready 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN: HIS BOOK 

" I do not perceive," wrote Lincoln in 1858, " how I can express 
myself more plainly than I have in the foregoing. I have expressly 
disclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality 
between the white and black races. I have made it equally plain 
that I think the negro is included in the word ' men ' used in the 
Declaration of Independence." 

This volume is a facsimile reproduction of Lincoln's note-book in 
which he put down his views on negro equality.

THE PHILIPPINES : The War and the People 

Being a Record of Personal Observations and Experiences 

By ALBERT Q. ROBINSON. 

This book, which will constitute one of the most important con- 
tributions to first-hand sources of information concerning the Phil- 
ippines, is made up primarily of letters written to the New York 
Evening Post by Mr. Robinson as its Special Correspondent. The 
substance of these letters has been expanded and wrought over into 
a clear, connected, and complete statement of what the author saw 
in the Philippines and what he thinks about what he saw there.

Henry Norman. Cloth, IZmo, $1.50. 

Under the divisions Siberia, China, and Japan, the author has 
traced the development of Asia from their golden age of long ago 
down to the modern present. He treats comprehensively the evo- 
lution of Japan, the astonishing development of Russia in Siberia, 
and the changes in China. " Altogether," says the Nation, " this is 
a very timely and very able book by an author who gathers without 
prejudice his facts at first hand."

"Mr. Parsons writes with great clearness, simplicity, and good 
sense, and in a spirit of reasonableness that will commend his book 
to all serious readers. It is full of first-hand information of a valu- 
able character, enlivened and brightened by touches of humor and 
by anecdotes that make it readable throughout" Commercial 
Advertiser (New York). 

THE GREAT BOER WAR 

By A. CONAN DOYLE. 

12mo, $1.50. 

"A good view of the year's warfare, a thoroughly readable ac- 
count of the transactions in their bearings upon one another, with 
vivid and not highly colored battles, and with a discussion of the 
causes and probable outcome of the war, which is moderate and gen- 
erous in temper, judicial in praise and blame, and without a trace 
of rancor or mere partisanship." The Nation.

College. Two volumes in one, with 
maps. 8vo, $2.75 net. 

" Professor Andre ws's work . . . 
on its first appearance from the 
press was recognized widely as an 
original and instructive addition to 
historical literature. Certain char-

sound judgment and penetrating

none is likely to prove more useful

FREDERIC MYERS. 

For some unaccountable reason, the American 
press has ignored the death of Frederic Myers, 
which occurred as long ago as the seventeenth 
of last month. We saw no reference to it at 
the time, and it was not until the arrival of 
the English journals dated January 26 that 
we were made aware of the grievous loss sus- 
tained by English literature in this death. 
While in no sense a popular writer, Mr. Myers 
had a considerable following among readers of 



choice intelligence, and these, at least, will feel 
that a score of notorieties might have been 
better spared than this graceful poet and ac- 
complished essayist. The loss to our letters 
of the living personality of Mr. Myers is of 
much the same weight as was the loss of Walter 
Pater, and will be felt by much the same class 
of readers. He was one of the few men of our 
time who had mastered the literary species 
which we call the essay, and had vindicated its 
right to be considered one of the forms of 
creative literature. His " Virgil," his " Greek 
Oracles," his " Mazzini," and his " Tennyson 
as Prophet," are hardly surpassed in all the 
range of our modern essay-writing ; they be- 
long in the same category with the best essays 
of Arnold and Newman and Pater ; they are 
productions to be read and reread in the spirit 
with which we read the great masterpieces of 
verse, and they provide for us a similar quality 
of delight. A few of these essays constitute 
the chief claim of Mr. Myers upon our affec- 
tions ; but it must not be forgotten that he has 
also given us, in his life of Wordsworth, one 
of the best of critical biographies, and in his 
" St. Paul," one of the most spiritual of our 
extended poems. 

Frederic William Henry Myers was born in 
the Wordsworth country, at Keswick, Febru- 
ary 6, 1843. His College was Trinity of Cam- 
bridge, where he remained for some years after 
taking his degree, both as fellow and as exam- 
iner for the Moral Science Tripos. Like Ar- 
nold, he was for many years an Inspector of 
Schools, but Cambridge continued to be his 
home for the rest of his life. It was here that 
his literary work was done, and that he gath- 
ered about his home many of the choicest 
spirits of his time, attracted, in the words of 
the " Athenaeum " memorial, by " one whose 
width of scientific interest and intensity of 
temperament were completed by a memory and 
a gift of exposition which was Platonic in its 
wealth of illustration and subtlety of humor, 
its magnificence and its mysticism." Leaving 
England, under doctor's orders, last December, 
he went with his family to the Riviera, and 
then proceeded to Rome to join his friend 
Professor William James. It was in Rome 
that he died, in the " city of the soul " that he 
had known so well in his earlier years, and

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



which had furnished inspiration for some of 
his finest verses. 

The books of Frederic Myers are few in 
number ; half a dozen titles practically make 
out the list. There are the two volumes of 
poems, "St. Paul" and "The Kenewal of 
Youth," there is the study of Wordsworth in 
the " English Men of Letters " series, and 
there are the three miscellaneous volumes called 
" Essays Classical," " Essays Modern," and 
" Science and a Future Life." But these six 
volumes belong to English literature, for they 
are among the sources of spiritual refreshment 
that the future will not quickly neglect. Per- 
haps mention should also be made of the share 
taken by Mr. Myers in the work called 
" Phantasms of the Living " but it is not for 
such work that he will be remembered, and, 
however imperative seemed to him the personal 
call to enlist in this will o' the wisp pursuit, it 
must be admitted by candid observers that the 
psychical research activities of his later years 
resulted in a loss to literature with no corres- 
ponding gain to science. Few men of our time 
have seen with such clearness the eternal veri- 
ties of beauty and conduct ; few have expressed 
them with such eloquence or with so convincing 
an appeal to the highest idealism of which human 
nature is capable. That his superb powers 
should have been diverted into the field of un- 
profitable speculation, and have undertaken a 
task which was manifestly unworthy of them, is 
a circumstance that must always be regrettable. 

The best of the essays of this writer are 
almost matchless in their effectiveness of con- 
struction and their beauty of expression. 
When in full sympathy with his theme, he has 
the power to impart both his thought and his 
emotion to the reader so fully that they become 
a permanent possession. The elements of this 
power almost elude analysis, yet we may easily 
distinguish such features as the charm of the 
writer's cadence, his felicitous use of quotation, 
and the cumulative effect produced by his 
skilful marshalling of illustrative material. 
An extract from the "Virgil" will help to 
make clear our meaning. After making a series 
of references to parti cularVirgilian verses preg- 
nant with emotional associations, he goes on : 

" But there is not at any rate need to prove the es- 
timation in which Virgil has been held in the past. 
The force of that tradition would only be weakened by 
specification. The chastest poet,' in Bacon's words, 
and royalest, Virgilius Maro, that to the memory of 
man is known,' has lacked in no age until our own the 
concordant testimony of the civilized world. No poet 
has lain so close to so many hearts; no words so often 



as his have sprung to men's lips in moments of excite- 
ment and self- revelation, from the one fierce line re- 
tained and chanted by the untameable boy who was to 
be Emperor of Rome, to the impassioned prophecy of 
the great English statesman as he pleaded till morning's 
light for the freedom of a continent of slaves. And 
those who have followed by more secret ways the in- 
fluence which these utterances have exercised on man- 
kind know well, perhaps themselves have shared, the 
mass of emotion which has slowly gathered round certain 
lines of Virgil's as it has round certain texts of the Bible, 
till they come to us charged with more than an individual 
passion and with a meaning wider than their own 
with the cry of the despair of all generations, with the 
yearning of all loves uuappeased, with the anguish of all 
partings, ' beneath the pressure of separate eternities.' " 

Such prose as this is an achievement no less 
remarkable than is poetry of a very high order, 
and patches of this royal purple are not infre- 
quent in the text of the three volumes of essays. 
The wanderings of Mr. Myers in the morass 
of psychical research resulted from a passionate 
desire to secure to other men rational grounds 
for the resting of their fundamental religious 
beliefs. His own faith, of the transcendental 
sort that feels no need of corroborative evidence, 
was voiced in these stanzas from " St. Paul ": 

" Whoso has felt the Spirit of the Highest 

Cannot confound nor doubt Him nor deny ; 
Yea, with one voice, world, though thou denieat, 

Stand thou on that side, for on this am I. 
"Rather the earth shall doubt when her retrieving 

Pours in the rain and rushes from the sod, 
Rather than he for whom the great conceiving 
Stirs in his soul to quicken into God." 

But this inward illumination does not come to 
the many, who stand sadly in need of a more 
material justification for their faith. This was 
the thought that impelled Mr. Myers to sift the 
accumulations of popular superstition, thinking 
perchance to find therein the grain of truth 
so deeply longed for by mankind. This it was 
that made him find, as in the Messianic Eclogue 
of Virgil, a truly prophetic utterance in these 
Tennysonian lines : 

" And we, the poor earth's dying race, and yet 
No phantoms, watching from a phantom shore 
Await the last and largest sense to make 
The phantom walls of this illusion fade 
And show us that the world is wholly fair." 

This it was that made him end his essay on 
" Tennyson as Prophet " in the following un- 
forgettable strain : 

" If indeed the Cosmos make for good, and evolution 
be a moral as well as a material law, will men in time 
avail to prove it ? For then they will look back on 
Tennyson as no belated dreamer, but as a leader who 
in the darkest hour of the world's thought would not 
despair of the destiny of man. They will look back 
on him as Romans looked back on that unshakable 
Roman who purchased at its full price the field of 
Cannae, on which at that hour victorious Hannibal lay 
encamped with his Carthaginian host."

MESSAGES OF THE NINETEENTH 
CENTURY POETS. 

Perspective is a prime essential of true vision. 
One merely conjures with the future when, at the 
completion of the nineteenth century, he essays 
definite prediction regarding the ultimate place of 
its authors, either in specific rank or in comparative 
services to the world's literature. Moreover, such 
valuations often change with the needs and moods 
of successive generations. One age gives exclusive 
laurels to Socrates, Dante, Shakespeare, and Addi- 
son. The next, with equal fervor, urges the rival 
claims of Plato, Petrarch, Bacon, and Samuel John- 
son. Poetry, no less than other forms of literature 
during the last hundred years, has had an unpre- 
cedented list of aspirants for the Hall of Fame. 
Possibly a later generation of readers, in the reac- 
tion from the hurtling haste of present life, may find 
some true " life of the spirit " among the submerged, 
as well as the popular, poets of the past cycle. 

In every century and nation, there have been 
poets of evanescent charm versus poets with per- 
manent message. The former may excel in beauties 
of form, but they fail to win that lasting, reverential 
memory which signalizes the " vates," or prophet- 
poet. Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Burns, Goethe, 
each had a mission and a message not alone to 
the ear but also to the soul of his century. Elimi- 
nating all question of rank, we recognize certain 
prophecies, fulfilled or potential, spoken by the rep- 
resentative poets in England and America during 
the last century. 

Critics have noted that the period at the meeting 
of centuries, arbitrary rather than logical in divi- 
sion of time, is often marked by unrest, contradic- 
tion, and transition. Whether such symptoms are 
psychologic or pathologic, it is not our part to dis- 
cuss. The Revolutionary movement, the last in the 
great triad of progressive world-forces, germinated 
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and cul- 
minated in the eighteenth. Its frenzied aftermath 
in France, seeming to presage the overthrow of all 
new-established ideals of liberty and faith, produced 
the gloom and vacillation which ushered in the 
nineteenth century. Senancour, Lamartine, and 
Chateaubriand in France, Byron, Wordsworth, and 
Coleridge in England, mirrored the hope, quenched 
by despair, on this final battle-ground of the old 
and new political principles. The constitutional 
reforms in England, which for more than a century 
had doomed absolutism, had found recognition and 
prophecy of yet greater advance in the earlier 
prophet-poets, Cowper, Blake, and Burns, who was 
emboldened to proclaim, 

'' But while we sing ' God save the King,' 
We '11 ne'er forget the People." 

As the decades passed, with the surety that, despite 
the transitory horrors of its progress, political lib- 
erty had become a fixed world-principle, the English 
poets uttered their triumphant message of democ- 



racy. The earlier group found it almost impossible 
to reconcile the lofty concepts of freedom and pro- 
gress with the social and religious anarchism rife 
during the final contention, yet they never relin- 
quished their ideals. Amid the desperate scepticism 
of " Childe Harold " and " Giaour," one clear note 

sounded : 

'* Freedom's battle, once began, 
Beqaeath'd by bleeding sire to son, 
Though battled oft, is ever won." 

The boyish unrestraint of Shelley's " Ode to Lib- 
erty " became softened into the calmer though vague 
hope of " Prometheus Unbound " and ' The Cenci." 
Readers are familiar with the successive stages of 
Wordsworth's poetic self-revelations, from the early 
hey-day of enthusiasm, followed by havoc of hopes 
and beliefs, to the gradual attainment of a sane, 
steadfast faith in ultimate freedom from all material 
and spiritual shackles. The life-story repeats itself 
from " The Prelude " and early sonnets to " Tintern 
Abbey " and " The Excursion." 

Democracy has not been a stable institution bat 
a progressive movement. Overthrow of political 
despotism was only an advance stage in its incep- 
tion. Tennyson, the true exponent of the pulse of 
the last half-century, embodied this thought in the 
dedicatory stanzas '" To the Queen ": 

" And statesmen at her councils met 
Who knew the seasons when to take 
Occasion by the hand and make 
The bounds of freedom wider yet 

" By shaping some august decree 

Which kept her throne unshaken still, 
Broad-based upon her people's will, 
And compassed by the inviolate sea." 

The democracy of these later decades, ever tending 
toward socialism and suggesting the abolition of 
constitutional monarchy and republic alike, is re- 
flected in the songs and visions by Swinburne, 
William Morris, and their disciples, but their true 
services to the poetry of the age will be noted later 
in a different message. 

Democracy was the fontal principle of the life of 
America, and her poetry could not fail to portray 
its emanation. The noble hymns of Emerson, the 
virile war-songs of Whittier, Lowell's famous satire 
and his later Commemoration odes, can never be 
overlooked in a review of the poetry which inter- 
prets the vital issues of the century. The term, 
" Poet of Democracy," has been accepted as the 
especial cognomen of that American author whose 
poetry is open to constant challenge, but his democ- 
racy, never. Whitman's message is bold, some- 
times blatant, yet vibrant with courage and elemental 
worship. Delighting in the repetitive utterance of 
"the word, Democratic, the word, En-Masse," he 
was also a loud herald of the second great principle 
of the century, closely linked with democracy, 
fraternity : 
" I will make the most splendid race the snn ever shone upon, 

I will make divine, magnetic lands, 

With the love of comrades. 

With the life-long love of comrades." 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



In spite of the later revolutions on the Continent, 
when human life seemed of less value than chaff, 
the germinal movement toward democracy ever 
commingled brotherhood with political rights for 
the individual and the nation. This altruistic ideal 
has expanded as the political principle has pro- 
gressed, until it has permeated the spirit of nearly 
all great poetry of the age. Victor Hugo, Heine, 
Coppe"e, Tolstoi, have joined with English and 
American authors in iteration of the gospel of 
mutual, uplifting service. In his briefer lyrics, 
and in the tender narratives of " Margaret " and 
u Michael," Wordsworth testified to his close sym- 
pathy with the heart of the common people, to his 
advocacy of social as well as political unity. " The 
Bridge of Sighs," " Apparent Failure," " The Cry 
of the Human," " The Vision of Sir Launf al," 
such poems bear stamp of a century awakened, as 
never before, to fraternal and social service. Lanier, 
in " The Symphony," and Kipling, in his staccato 
pleas for oppressed and submerged humanity, have 
given timely rebuke to that commercialism and 
competition which threaten death to the spirit of 
brotherhood. 

One of the anterior influences which gave impetus 
to democracy was the increase, during the eighteenth 
century, of scientific knowledge among all classes. 
This propagation, through English and French en- 
cyclopaedic and philosophic channels, reached its 
natural culmination in the famous expositions dur- 
ing the middle decades of the century. Dangers 
of materialism and spiritual chaos lurked about the 
tenets of Darwin and Huxley, Spencer and Mill, 
until the years could fuse and interpret, could re- 
place the shattered illusions with new joy and sat- 
isfaction in fixed laws controlling Nature and life. 
To wisely apply such scientific knowledge and 
method to all phases of the century's life, poli- 
tics, economics, religion, became the mission of 
the poets no less than the philosophers and reform- 
ers. In place of the social anarchism of Godwin, 
the political and religious despair of Byron, and 
the embryonic yet unfulfilled philosophy of Cole- 
ridge, came into life and poetry the surety of a 
scientific law which could satisfy both the reason 
and soul. With a mind plastic to the premonitions 
of the future as well as the influences of the past, 
Shelley had yearned to the last for that " Spirit of 
the Universe," that vast " Force-Idea," so soon to 
be vested with new scientific insight and reverence. 

A sincere, persistent zeal for the deep facts and 
laws pervaded poetry and produced the so-called 
realism of Wordsworth, Arnold, Clough, and their 
followers. A new poetic imagination, combining 
the real and the ideal, was symbolized in Words- 
worth's " Skylark," 

" Type of the wise who soar but never roam, 

True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home." 
In " The Spanish Gypsy," as in her later novels, 
George Eliot applied this spirit of science in the 
analysis of character and in ethical teaching. 
Matthew Arnold proclaimed the ultimate blending 



of science and poetry, of Nature's law and man's 
work. Emerson and Whitman, in most distinctive 
forms, announced the poetic harmony of all physical 
and psychic forces, 

" For Nature beats in perfect tune, 
And rounds with rhyme her every rune." 

The two great English poets of the latter half of 
the century were marked adherents of evolutionary 
method. Browning turned the lens of a scientist, 
with the intense sympathy of a poet, upon the 
hidden motor struggles of passion and soul. Tenny- 
son studied the scientific laws no less than the pic- 
torial beauties of the ''Flower in the Crannied 
Wall," while he also explored the manifestations 
of mind and heart. " Sordello " and " Rabbi Ben 
Ezra," " In Memoriam," and " The Higher Pan- 
theism," all witness " One God, one Law, one 
Element." 

Coexistent with the political and scientific ad- 
vance which had awakenfd the world from the 
atrophy of the previous century, had come religious 
revolutions, extending with diverse radiations 
through the entire nineteenth century. In the 
main, the progress of theological thought has been 
in accord with the affiliated principles of freedom 
and scientific law. Mr. Allen's story in poetic 
prose is a fitting climatic expression of the evolu- 
tionary, religious leaven of the century. There have 
been, however, occasional reactionary symptoms, 
like the Tractarian and other ecclesiastic move- 
ments, which have caused doubts and recessions, 
often reflected in the poetry of the last half-century. 
Perhaps no poet sought more earnestly than Clough 
to find and transmit a religious message to his age. 
Lacking the emotional equipoise of Arnold, with 
whom he shared the disturbing influences of Ox- 
ford, he made a valiant fight against the refuge of 
agnosticism, and spent himself in a struggle to rec- 
oncile religious uncertainties with spiritual vision 
and aspiring life. Over the doubt shines a rare 
spiritual fervor, rapturous in " Easter. Day " and 
'Through a Glass Darkly." Clough found the 
panacea for religious gropings in the message of 
" Qui Laborat, Orat," a strong poetic rendering of 
Carlyle's Gospel of Work. 

Tennyson, prone by nature to speculation, influ- 
enced yet more by the religious atmosphere of 
unrest and by personal grief, traversed successive 
mental stages, from the vacillation of " The Two 

O 

Voices" to the acceptance with 

" Faith that comes of self-control 
The truths that never can be proved," 

which forms the message of " In Memoriam " and 
of his later poems. With Clougb, Tennyson em- 
phasized the religion of effort, first, to surpass our 
" dead selves," second, to perform some service for 
the world. The pivotal note in his great elegy 
rests upon this gospel ; then bursts forth the New 
Year's carol, merging individual loss and doubt 
beneath hopes for a nobler world-religion. 

Browning, with a child-like, unquestioning trust,

akin to that of Whittier. expends none of his 
matchless analysis upon religions dogmas, but pro- 
claims, as basis of his creed, a militant knowledge 
born of dauntless faith. In Tennyson's strongest 
assurances, his chosen words are " hope " or " be- 
lieve "; Browning and Whittier fearlessly exclaim, 
" I know." It were difficult to long cherish doubt 
when under the spell of " Abt Vogler " or "Para- 
celsus ": 

" I know, I felt, (perception unexpressed, 
Uncomprehended by our narrow thought, 
But somehow felt and known in every shift 
And change in the spirit, nay, in every pore 
Of the body, even, ) what God is, what we are, 
What life is how God tastes an infinite joy 
In infinite ways one everlasting bliss 
From whom all being emanates, all power 
Proceeds ; in whom is life forevermore, 
Yet whom existence in its lowest form 
Includes ; where dwells enjoyment there is he." 

Browning's religion, however, is not confined to 
faith ; it has a major passionate strain. All life is 
a conflict, a battle between " the spirit's true en- 
dowments " and the forces of evil within and about 
man. It is this quality of unceasing, strenuous 
struggle, always with a guarantee of victory for 
the good soldier, that gives to his poems a dramatic 
energy capable of triumph over obscurities and 
wilful laxities which would be unpardonable in any 
lesser poet. The same " drum-taps " of robust, 
zealous life, immense in passion, pulse, and 
power," give vitality and far-reaching force to the 
stanzaic messages of Whitman and Kipling. 

While modern life, with its strenuonsness. its 
zeal for newness and thrill in thought and emotions, 
its pride in political, scientific, and religious advance 
unequalled in any previous century, has had full 
reflection in the poetry of the age, there has been 
a revival, no less unprecedented, of the ideals and 
forms of earlier art and thought. The universal 
message of poetry as an art has been as distinctly 
uttered as the problems and aspirations of present- 
day activity. Browning, Tennyson, and Morris 
have chosen the symbolism and atmosphere of 
medisevalism, the ideals and traditions of chivalry 
and the Renaissance, as media for strong social 
warnings and prophecies. To re-study and re-picture 
the beauties of fancy and noble life among the 
Greeks, the Norsemen, and the disciples of chivalry 
and monasticism, with the masterly skill of Landor, 
Keats, Rossetti, and Swinburne, is to perform no 
small service for the literature of an age too prone 
to forget the past in pressure of current interests. 

Prince of the poets who sought relief from the 
confusions of his own age in the reposeful glories 
of past art, is Keats. Amid the social and religious 
ferment about him he spoke the reactionary mes- 
sage of art as the true guide toward a life where 
truth and beauty could be identical. His place 
and mission in the century's literature closely re- 
sembles Ruskin's. The new century may well heed 
their warnings against such absorption in commer- 
cialism and science as will shrivel the artistic faculty 



and dwarf the soul. In workmanship, whether as 
rejuvenators of some forgotten fancy and metre, 
or as creators of some new beauty under familiar 
form, the century's poets of pure art have merited 
high praise. A generation which could produce 
" The Blessed Damozel," " The Earthly Paradise," 
and " Atlanta in Calydon," to mention no further, 
has already attained rank among the great master- 
artists in verse. 

One could easily enumerate a long list of themes, 
touching the minds, morals, emotions, and tastes 
of this age, upon which the poets of the century 
have spoken with oracular force. There remains, 
however, one characteristic, perchance the most 
comprehensive and important, surely the most uni- 
versal, trait of the poets. A keen observation, 
mingled with an intimate sympathy for Nature, is 
noted alike among realists and romanticists, among 
the earlier and later poets with cumulative fervor. 
The eighteenth century initiated this relationship 
between humanity and the sanative lessons of wave 
and wind, bird and flower. The spread of science 
merely gave new and definite impetus to the ideals 
already bespoken by Rousseau and the Sentimen- 
talists, by Cowper and Crabbe, by Thomson and 
Young. Logical observation and health-inspiring 
comradeship, with ever increasing unity, have per- 
meated the poetry of the century from Wordsworth 
to Watson. American poets must rest their claim 
to recognition largely upon their intuitive, delicate 
Nature-lyrics. The poet has served a special mission 
in an age of science. He has combined the quali- 
ties of analyst and artist ; he has urged communion 
as well as study. Viewed thus, not alone as an 
element but also as a presence. Nature offers, 
through the poets, the only possible expansion of 
life in its entirety, the only unassailable fount of 
religious teaching. "Saul," one of the master- 
poems of the century, is a noble embodiment of this 
truth. Through the sensuous, life-bestowing media 
of Nature's images, the king's shattered mind re- 
gained its poise and God-recognizing power. 

Glancing over the poetry of the cycle, we recog- 
nize that much has been crude and ephemeral, much 
has been potent and energizing. There have been 
produced no great dramas, no great epics, but the 
record contains a few noble elegies, some matchless 
sonnets, character-portrayals unsurpassed in real 
vitality, and a vast number of lyrics whose fancy 
and melody admit of no competition in previous 
centuries. Five great names, at least, deserve 
rank beside the prophet-poets of the past, Words- 
worth, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, and Browning. 
There have been poems of doubt and despair, mes- 
sages of agnosticism and futility of effort, but the 
passing decades have proclaimed less unrest, more 
faith, less heart-eating apathy, more soul-stimulating 
conflict for the individual and the race, 

"By the pain-throb, triumphantly winning intensified bliss, 
And the next world's reward and repose, by the struggles 
in this."

SOME QUESTIONS SUGGESTED BY PROFESSOR 

WENDELL'S "LITERARY HISTORY OF AMERICA." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAI,.) 

On the strength of the editorial in THE DIAL of 
Dec. 16, I have beten reading Professor Wendell's 
" Literary History of America," and I quite agree with 
you that Professor Wendell in this book " has produced 
incomparably the best history of American Literature 
thus far written by anybody." It is, in many respects, 
a profound book. It is at all times a readable book. 
Its characterization of movements and authors is well- 
nigh absolute with the exception perhaps of its treat- 
ment of Poe and Whitman, the two doubtful members 
of the American school, who ought to be given at this 
time, one would think, the benefit of the doubt. But 
with all its merits it is still a debatable book, and I 
have set down, without elaboration, some of the points 
about which there might be dispute. 

In the first place the series of literary histories, of 
which this volume is one, was conceived by a European 
from a European point of view. In the foreword of 
the series one reads of " the conflict of dynasties," " the 
popular panorama of kings and queens," " the quarrels 
of rival parliaments," which, it is said, have hitherto 
engrossed the attention of historians. On this ground 
there is surely no reason for a literary history of 
America. Not having been dazzled by kings and queens, 
our historians notably Parkman, Eggleston, Roose- 
velt, and Fiske have done full justice to every phase 
of our national development, including the intellectual 
and artistic. In the same preface it is written that 
" in spite of history, the poets are the true masters of 
the earth," and that " if all record of a nation's progress 
were blotted out, and its literature were yet left us, 
might we not recover the outlines of its lost history? " 
In view of the fact that no American poet, with possibly 
one or two exceptions, has ever mastered any portion 
of this earth our expansion being frankly materialistic, 
even imperialistic," if you please, and not transcen- 
dental the first claim seems preposterous, and the 
other suggestion is denied by the very evidence of this 
present literary history. Two centuries of American 
history, a period big with events, are almost without 
literary record, and of the 518 pages of this volume, 
479 deal with Boston and New England and what is 
called here the "Middle States" (with the western 
boundary at Philadelphia ! ). A poor hurried section 
of thirty- nine pages is devoted to the South and the 
rest of the United States ! This denotes either that 
Professor Wendell happens to know more about Boston 
than about the rest of the Republic, or that the propo- 
sition that our literature is equivalent to our history is 
false. The fact is that the intellectual life of Ameri- 
cans is not confined by the walls of colleges or by the 
pages of books. The Men who Do are with us far 
more intellectual, energetic, and creative, than the Men 
who Write. Boston Unitarianism and Transcendental- 
ism are not of much moment compared with the Win- 
ning of the West. 

There are other points of Professor Wendell's own 
statement that are also debatable. I have jotted down 
a few to present to a class which has the volume under 
review. 

(1) Is it true that the ideals of a nation are shaped 
by the language it adopts for a common medium? 



Trace the influence of " the tongue that Shakespeare 
spake and the faith and morals which Milton held " 
upon the German settlers in Chicago or upon the Ne- 
groes of the South. How much do race and environ- 
ment modify the primary effects of language? 

(2) Do you accept the substitution of the phrase, 
" English Literature in America," for the common des- 
ignation, " American Literature "? Would you speak 
likewise of French Art in America or German Music 
in America? 

(3) Is it more profitable as more rational to 
study American Literature as an independent develop- 
ment, correlating our own literature and history, or as 
a dependent literature, with emphasis upon the tradi- 
tional and imitative features and its correspondence to 
English literature? (I shall here point to the ease of 
making comparison by the use of Ryland's and Whit- 
comb's " Outlines," and also to Professor Wendell's 
satirical remark concerning Prince's History of New 
England, which began its account with " an epitome of 
the most remarkable transactions and events abroad, 
from the creation.") 

(4) Do you prefer to say the United States are or 
the United States isf Is this merely a question of 
grammar? Would the study of English Literature in 
America affect the idealism of one who persists in 
speaking of the United States as plural? 

(5) In discussing the literary history of America is it 
sufficient to consider only what is written in the English 
language? Is it fair to ignore the French literature of 
Louisiana? Would Rosenfeld's sweat-shop poems, writ- 
ten in Yiddish, have any bearing upon American history? 

(6) Does the actual history of America, as recorded 
by John Fiske, betoken " national inexperience "? Does 
England exhibit any less " inexperience " than America 
in respect to those forces which are shaping the modern 
world in both hemispheres? How much of England's 
substantial experience is due to the survival of the 
feudal traditions down to and including Tennyson? 
Was not the revolutionary literature of England due to 
England's inability to have a genuine revolutionary ex- 
perience? Would the meagre revolutionary literature 
of France indicate " national inexperience " also? 

(7) In a literary history of America how much atten- 
tion should be given to local phases of thought, such as 
Boston Unitarianism and Transcendentalism? 

(8) Do you agree with Professor Wendell in his ex- 
planation of the growth of " imperialism " in England 
and America? 

I consider it the function of a pedagogue to put 
questions as it is perhaps the function of a historian 
of literature to arouse them.

THE NINE GREAT AUTHORS OF THE 
NINETEENTH CENTURY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Jackson Boyd's communication in the Jan. 16 
number of THE DIAL on " Ten Great Authors of the 
Century " might perhaps better have been deferred 
to a later issue, so that he could have had time and 
opportunity to profit by Mr. Charles Leonard Moore's 
statement in the same number: " The most aggravating 
of all critics is the critic who asserts. ..." Positivism 
would seem, from his article, to be Mr. Boyd's philos- 
ophy of literature, if not of life. Certainly his state-

THE DIAL

ments have the merit of certitude and conviction, in 
spite of their very evident defects from the standpoint 
of "things as they are." 

Mr. Boyd's article calls Schopenhauer, Comte, Dar- 
win, Spencer, Marx, Ward, Eliot, de Maupassant, Tol- 
stoi, and Bentham " the preeminent authors of the 
nineteenth century." Thus he does not give a list of " the 
greatest influences of the century," or " the greatest 
men of the century," but of " the greatest authors of the 
century," in short, the greatest writers of literature. 

Mr. Boyd goes somewhat beyond necessity when he 
says: "Schopenhauer is the greatest metaphysician 
that ever lived." He had need only to prove that he 
was the greatest metaphysician of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, to prove his greatness as a nineteenth century 
metaphysician. But Schopenhauer might be " the 
greatest metaphysician that ever lived," or ever will 
live, and still fail to be one of " the preeminent authors 
of the nineteenth century " one of the makers of lit- 
erature. Literature has no final (only an accidental) 
relation with metaphysics. 

He says, of science, " Charles Darwin was the most 
argumentative mind of the century." What of it? 
" Literature is the presentation of life in an artistic 
form. No man of science has ever been an artist, al- 
though some, as, for example, Darwin and Huxley, 
have been believed by their friends to have been such." 
Thus Mr. Clement K. Shorter, and " the consensus of 
critical opinion " upholds his position. 

" Herbert Spencer is the greatest Individualist of the 
race." Perhaps he is the greatest " individual " of the 
race. He is certainly great in his sphere; but as a 
writer of literature he has surprisingly little to offer. 

Karl Marx is one of the " master-minds of man." 
But he is not one of the master-minds of literature. 
His claims to literary greatness may be dismissed with 
the statement that he was " a famous German socialist." 
What has that to do with literature ? 

" Lester F. Ward is the most practical philosopher 
the century has produced." As " practical philosophy's " 
connection with literature is of the remotest, we need, 
perhaps, say no more about Mr. Ward's literary claims 
to "real greatness." 

11 George Eliot is the only writer of light literature 
who has any claim to real greatness." " It is indeed a 
discovery," writes Brander Matthews in " Aspects of 
Fiction," " to find that any man able to read and write 
is capable of classifying as ' light literature ' the acute 
and subtle study of the process of Tito's steady moral 
disintegration under recurring temptation." The ref- 
erence, of course, is to George Eliot's " Romola." The 
same statement applies with about equal force to George 
Eliot's other work. It is also, indeed, a discovery to 
learn that " light literature " gives anyone a claim to 
" real greatness." But granting that George Eliot has 
other claims to " real greatness " than " light literature," 
surely the nineteenth century has produced novelists 
greater than she, Balzac and Hugo in France ; Thack- 
eray, Dickens, and George Meredith in England. 

" Guy de Maupassant is the most artistic story-teller 
the world has ever produced." This is the only one of 
Mr. Boyd's formulas to which we can give even partial 
acceptance. The art of Guy de Maupassant, which 
produced such achievements of story-telling as " The 
Piece of String," "The Necklace," "Coward," and 
" Little Soldier," is certainly an art which, in mere 
artfulness (I do not use the term slightingly), has sel- 
dom been equalled. He has a few disputants to the 



title of " the greatest short-story teller of the century," 
however, as, for example, Robert Louis Stevenson, 
who, though inferior to the Frenchman in form and 
structure, surpasses him in the richness and charm of 
his style, and is ethically stronger at all points. And 
Poe and Hawthorne ! The author of " The Cask of 
Amontillado," and the man who wrote " Wakefield " 
and " David Swan," have produced almost if not quite as 
great short stories as have ever been written in French. 

"Count Leo Tolstoi [is] the most artistic novelist 
[the world has ever produced]." I am as much sur- 
prised at this statement as the author of " Anna Kare- 
nina" himself would be, if he heard of it. "God's 
moral " is what he is after, and he often shows it, 
seldom artistically, more often with evident effort. As 
far as form goes, he is huge and structureless. 

" One of the greatest authors of all time is Jeremy 
Bentham." The writings of Jeremy Bentbam have no 
literary merit whatever. His style is turgid, involved, 
and obscure. Even as knowledge they have been largely 
superseded. 

And now, having tried to set aside Mr. Boyd's list of 
"the preeminent authors of the nineteenth century," 
what have I to offer in its place? 

Who will dispute that Browning and Tennyson are 
the greatest poets of the nineteenth century, and two of 
the greatest poets of all time? 

No historian, essayist, or other writer in prose other 
than fiction, except John Ruskin, has attained to the 
first rank in literature in the nineteenth century. But 
his, at its best, magnificent style, like the peals of some 
" grand organ harmony " swelling, helps lift his work 
away from the mere writing of knowledge, " discussion 
and conflict," up to the " eternal peaks of pure litera- 
ture." John Ruskin ranks among " the nine great authors 
of the nineteenth century," in spite of the fact that his 
work is, mostly, not included in any of the three great 
forms of literary art. 

In fiction, Balzac and George Meredith are the great- 
est novelists, while the short story has four equalities, 
Poe, de Maupassant, Hawthorne, and Stevenson. In 
Robert Louis Stevenson we have both a writer of short 
stories of the very first rank ("Will o' the Mill," 
" Markheim," " Thrawn Janet "), and also a novelist 
who, in at least one of his tales, " The Strange Case of 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," gives us a story worthy to 
be ranked with the greatest fiction of the century of 
all time. Balzac is probably the greatest novelist of 
the world, and immeasurably his superior in all the 
" amenities of style " is Meredith. In technique, if in 
technique only, Meredith is without a peer, while " the 
body of his work " is also most satisfactory. Professor 
Saintsbury says: "When these two things coincide in 
literature, or elsewhere, then that in which they coincide 
may be called, and must be called, Great, without hesi- 
tation, and without reserve." Meredith's extreme jus- 
tification is in the future, while Balzac has already- 
come into his own. The art of Dickens and Thackeray 
(except, perhaps, in their masterpieces, " David Cop- 
perfield " and " Vanity Fair," certainly less in these 
than in the rest of their work) is, as Mr. Howells has 
recently shown, largely " the art of a by-gone age." 

Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Honore' de Balzac, 
George Meredith, Edgar Allen Poe, Robert Louis Stev- 
enson, Guy de Maupassant, Nathaniel Hawthorne, John 
Ruskin, these seem to me " the preeminent authors of 
the nineteenth century." ALEXANDER JESSUP.

OXFORD MEMORIES.* 

Someone, Carlyle we dare say, speaks of 
Diderot's books as "printed talk." The de- 
scription, which is a handy one and nowadays 
widely applicable, nicely fits the Rev. W. 
Tuckwell's book of Oxford recollections, and 
very good talk it is, though younger noses may 
detect in its earlier and even its later chapters 
a somewhat " ancient and fishlike smell." For 
Mr. Tuckwell seems the Nestor of Oxonians, 
his memories going back largely to Oxford in 
the Thirties the Oxford to which you were 
driven in a coach (the " Tantivy," the " Reg- 
ulator," the " Blenheim," the " Rival," and so 
forth), by a Jehu of the tribe of Weller ; the 
Oxford of Gibbonian " port and prejudice " ; 
the Oxford to which Museums, Art Galleries, 
Local Examinations, Science Degrees, Exten- 
sion Lectures, Women's Colleges, and the like 
commonplaces of to-day were as yet innovations, 
germinant or threatened, at which dondom 
gravely shook its head, scenting heresy and 
schism, and the intrusion of ideas subversive 
of scholastic standards, learned reputations, 
the reign of the Humanities, and fat livings. 
Science especially, with its bold pretensions, 
was, as Gambetta said of clericalism, felt to be 
" the enemy." Conservatism hated it because 
it was new ; orthodoxy because, like the inven- 
tor in Dickens, it persisted in " wanting to 
know." Even men like Jowett, says our 
author, 

" Proclaimed war on it on behalf of the ' ancient 
studies/ as encroaching on and menacing the ' higher 
conception of knowledge and of the mind,' as antago- 
nistic to ' morals and religion ' curiously unaware 
that their own avowed ignorance of its nature, subjects, 
tendencies, precluded them from forming, much more 
from expressing, an opinion." 

Science, however, persisted in its efforts to 
break into the sanctuary with (as its enemies 
might have said) " a jemmy "; and in the end 
succeeded. Molested was the ancient, solitary 
reign of Theology ; broken the monopoly of 
the Humanities. The first representative of 
note of the new learning was Daubeny 
Doctor Daubeny, professor of chemistry, bot- 
any, rural economy, who wrote on Roman 
husbandry, experimented much in horticulture, 
planting his famous " Physic Garden," and 
building houses wherein flourished the Victoria

lily, the aloe, and many plants unfamiliar to 
eyes dimmed by the study of Greek roots. 
The Doctor was something of an oddity, out- 
wardly a droll, fantastically clad figure, but 
genial and chatty in society. For zoological 
purposes he kept, in a great cage let into the 
Danby gateway, a collection of monkeys, which 
a mischievous undergraduate liberated one 
night, to the general joy of his appreciative 
fellows next day. The wanderers were re- 
captured, after an exciting chase and some 
perilous climbing ; but the Doctor was pained 
by what he considered an affront to himself, 
and his menagerie was eventually dispersed. 

Buckland was the next savant of note at 
Oxford. His lecture-room filled at once, not 
so much with students as with dons (attracted 
no less by the vivacity of his talk than the 
novelty of his theme), among them Shuttle- 
worth, father of the couplet 

"Some doubts were expressed about the Flood, 
Buckland arose, and all was clear as mud." 

Buckland at first posed as regular and rec- 
oncilist, his earlier writings containing little 
to provoke the heresy-hunters. Then, in 1836, 
appeared his Bridgewater Treatise, and stones 
from orthodox slings at once flew about his 
offending (and disregarding) head. Dean 
Gaisford of Christchurch thanked God on the 
fossil-hunting professor's departure for Italy. 
" We shall," he comfortably thought, " hear 
no more of his geology." Pusey, blinking 
anxiously at the new light, bustled about warn- 
ing men to avert their eyes from it, and or- 
ganizing a protest against the proposed degree 
for Professor Owen ; the saintly Keble clenched 
a bitter plea against the new science with the 
powerful argument worthy of patristic days 
that " when God made the stones he made the 
fossils in them." 

Buckland had a most efficient and zealous 
helper in his wife. From her, says Mr. Tuck- 
well, came the first suggestion as to the true 
character of the lias coprolites. 

" When, at two o'clock in the morning, the idea 
flashed upon him that the Cheirotherium footsteps were 
testudinal, he woke his wife from sleep; she hastened 
down to make paste upon the kitchen table, while he 
fetched in the tortoise from the garden; and the pair 
soon saw with joint delight that its impressions on the 
paste were almost identical with those upon the slabs." 

In Italy, as Dean Gaisford could not have 
been surprised to hear, Buckland went on 
pursuing the iconoclastic tenor of his way. At 
Palermo he visited Saint Rosalia's shrine. The 
receptacle was opened by the attendant priest, 
and the relics were reverently disclosed.

efficacy of faith) had knelt before them and 
had their souls eased thereby and their bodies 
healed, and had gratefully bestowed their 
obolus on departing. But to the hard eye of 
the man of science and little faith the bones 
were not sacred, were not even Rosalia's. 
" They are," said he, " the bones of a goat, 
not of a woman " and the sanctuary doors 
were abruptly shut in his face, as Oxford doors 
would have been before had Gaisford and the 
rest had their way about it. 

Before taking leave of Buckland let us quote 
his Johnsonian retort to a North Briton who 
"heckled" him during a lecture: 

" ' It would seem,' queried a sceptical Caledonian 
during a lecture in North Britain, ' that your animals 
alwavs walked in one direction?' 'Yes,' was the re- 
ply, ' Cheirotherium was a Scotchman, and be always 
travelled south.' " 

What the initiative and persistence of Dr. 
Acland did for the establishment of Science 
and Art at Oxford is, or ought to be, well 
known. He settled there as a physician in 
1844, and was made Lee's Reader of Anatomy 
at Christchurch. His lectures began in 1845, 
and a great impetus was at once given to the 
movement in favor of a Museum. It was felt 
that the old Ashmolean must be supplanted by 
a temple worthy of the University. Economists 
opposed the proposal on the ground of cost, 
the classicists fought it because it was novel, 
and the theologians condemned it as a subtle 
device of the evil one designed to sap the 
foundations of belief. Sewell of Exeter, " more 
Puseyite than Pusey," fulminated against it 
in a University sermon which was too bigoted 
even for the bigots, and which went far to 
convince sensible men that the hour for a de- 
termined stand against the bats and owls of 
the corporation councils was come. To the 
defenders of the Museum were soon joined 
men like Liddell and Professor Phillips ; and 
early in the Fifties the money was voted, the 
design adopted, and the first stone of the new 
building laid by Lord Derby. Once begun, 
the edifice " rose like an exhalation," glorified 
by the genius of artists like Woodward, Burne- 
Jones, Skidmore, the brothers Shea, Rossetti, 
Prinsep, Monro, Morris. 

The Museum's memorable welcome to the 
British Association was marked by the day of 
the great Darwin fight, when the opposing 
hosts, led respectively by Huxley and S. Wil- 
berforce, did battle over the strange hypothesis 
from morn till dewy eve. The Darwinian dis- 



cussion was of course the event of the week. 
It took place in the large Library, which was 
packed with expectant humanity eager as 
always for a fray in which the blows were to 
be borne by somebody else. Professor Hens- 
low presided, and by his side sat Huxley 
" hair jet black, slight whiskers, pale full 
fleshy face, the two strong lines of later years 
already marked, an ominous quiver in his 
mouth, and an arrow ready to come out of it." 
Professor Draper of New York, " eminent, 
serious, nasal," read a paper on Evolution ; 
after which an irrelevant person rose to say 
that all theories as to the ascent of man were 
vitiated by the fact that, in the words of Pope, 
Great Homer died three thousand years ago. 
To this Professor Huxley sarcastically declined 
to reply ; so the Bishop of Oxford, author of 
an article in the " Quarterly " denunciatory of 
Darwinism, and the accepted champion of 
Orthodoxy, took the floor. The Bishop, says 
our author, was " argumentative, rhetorical, 
amusing." He does not appear to have been 
dignified or profound. 

" He retraced the ground of his article, distinguished 
between a working and a causal hypothesis,' compli- 
mented ' Professor Huxley who is about to demolish 
me,' plagiarized from a mountebank sermon by Bur- 
gon, expressing the ' disquietude ' he should feel were 
a ' venerable ape ' to be shown to him as his ancestress 
in the Zoo : a piece of clever, diverting, unworthy clap- 
trap." 

In short, the Bishop of Oxford undertook to 
upset Darwinism by making fun of it ; and 
the fun, being of a cheap and puerile order, 
had no effect beyond tickling the ears of the 
groundlings, and provoking a retort of unpar- 
liamentary severity. 

" Huxley rose, white with anger. ' I should be sorry 
to demolish so eminent a prelate, but for myself I 
would rather be descended from an ape than from a 
divine who employs authority to stifle truth.' A gasp 
and a shudder through the room, the scientists uneasy, 
the orthodox furious, the Bishop wearing that fat, pro- 
voking smile which once, as Osborne Gordon reminds 
us, impelled Lord Derby in the House of Lords to an 
unparliamentary quotation from ' Hamlet.' ' I am 
asked,' Huxley went on, if I accept Mr. Darwin's 
book as a complete causal hypothesis. Belated on a 
roadless common on a dark night, if a lantern were 
offered to me, should I refuse it because it shed an im- 
perfect light ? I think not I think not.' " 

Happily the great Darwinian debate at the 
Museum was not without its humors. One 
ominous pause was broken by the important 
announcement of an elderly gentleman with a 
Roman nose that Mr. Darwin's book "had 
given him acutest pain." A roar of " Ques- 
tion ! " overwhelmed him, and he departed and

was seen no more. Another volunteer rose 
from the back benches during a lull in the 
storm, stepped smartly to the rostrum, and 
asked for a blackboard. This was produced, 
whereupon he, after deep thought, chalked two 
cabalistic crosses on opposite corners of it, 
opened his mouth to speak, lost his intellectual 
bearings, and stood vainly groping in the 
crypts of memory, until forced to his seat by 
inextinguishable laughter, the thought he had 
in him remaining, as Carlyle says, conjectural 
till this day. 

Mr. Tuckwell's sense of humor and keen 
eye for personal peculiarities lend zest and 
freshness to his portraits of Oxford worthies, 
and of these sketches his book forms a varied 
and amusing, and we dare say in their kind 
pictorially faithful, gallery. The subjects 
range from genuine notabilities, as Pusey, 
Newman, the Arnolds, Clough, Jowett, Lid- 
dell, Max Miiller, Mark Pattison, A. P. Stan- 
ley, etc., down to mere oddities, like "Horse" 
Kett and "Mo." Griffith, who were notable 
mainly because they were odd. Mr. Tuckwell 
has a good deal to say about Pusey, who, we 
suspect, attracted him more through his pe- 
culiarities than his intellectual gifts for there 
is a dash of caricature in his somewhat elab- 
orate portrait of this spectral and media3val- 
izing divine : 

"Two things impressed me when I first saw Dr. 
Pusey close: his exceeding slovenliness of person, . . . 
and the almost artificial sweetness of his smile, con- 
trasting as it did with the sombre gloom of his face when 
in repose. He lived the life of a godly eremite; reading 
no newspapers, he was unacquainted with the common- 
est names and occurrences; and was looked upon with 
much alarm in the Berkshire neighborhood, where an 
old lady much respected as a ' deadly one for prophecy,' 
had identified him with one of the three frogs which 
were to come out of the dragon's mouth. ... In con- 
trast with his disinclination for general talk was his 
morbid love of groping in the spiritual interiors of those 
with whom he found himself alone. He would ask of 
strangers questions which but for his sweet and cour- 
teous manner they must have deemed impertinent." 

Mr. Tuckwell goes on to relate the Doctor's 
attempts to play confessor with a surly groom 
who used to drive him in and out of Oxford. 
This man of Belial gruffly refused to have his 
" spiritual interior " vivisected, and was finally 
abandoned by the baffled Doctor as a " repro- 
bate." 

In Pusey 's case the boy was certainly father 
of the man. When a boy (if such we may 
call him) he was once invited by his gratified 
father to select some valuable present commem- 
orative of a prize-winning success at school. 



He chose " a complete set of the Fathers " ! 
His mother used to relate how in the Long 
Vacations he would sit for hours in a shady 
corner of the garden reading his folios, with 
a tub of cold water at hand into which he 
would plunge his head whenever study made it 
ache. The immersions must have been frequent. 
But we must now take leave of Mr. Tuck- 
well's chatty and multifarious book, recom- 
mending it as an entertaining repository of 
familiar talk about old Oxford, its ways and 
worthies, from the pen of a shrewd and sym- 
pathetic observer whose sense of humor and 
appreciation of the original t)r the eccentric in 
conduct and character brightens his pages and 
freshens his descriptions. It would have been 
easy to make a dull book or a stale one about 
Oxford in the Thirties ; but Mr. TuckwelPs 
impressions, being both lively and his own, 
are worth recording. There are sixteen illus- 
trations, among them some quaint plates after 
old prints and portraits. E. G. J. 



A MODERN ADAM AND EVE.* 



Whoever sits down to the perusal of Mrs. 
Albee's " Mountain Playmates " will rise re- 
freshed and exhilarated. There has been a 
vivifying contact with a many-sided, cultivated 
personality, and what is more grateful than 
the privilege of such exceptional companion- 
ship ? The subjects treated by the writer are 
varied, now the external affairs of every-day 
life, now the deepest questions that stir an 
earnest soul. A sparkling humor lends its 
fascination to the lighter matters, while the 
graver themes lose no shade of interest from 
the more serious manner with which they are 
discussed. 

The " Mountain Playmates " are no other 
than Mrs. Albee and her husband, a " studious, 
inactive " and in their friends' account, " im- 
practical pair," who throw their united energies 
into the work of transforming into a congenial 
summer home a long-abandoned farm in the 
Sandwich range of the White Mountains. 
Their means will permit of very slender outlay 
for the repair and equipment of their new 
possession, hence their wits are called into 
active employment for the supply of necessary 
requisites. It was inexpedient to rob their 
city residence of coveted rugs, chairs, draperies, 
etc., and search was instituted " in the garret,

the tool-house, and the corn chamber for pos- 
sible articles that could be made to serve a 
needful purpose. 

" Was there a dissipated wreck of a table, I took it 
firmly in hand and said ' Brace up; I intend to set you 
on your feet again, and shall put new life into you: 
there is a happy future awaiting those who behave 
themselves.' Was there a chair with an amputated leg 
or disintegrated vitals; a little surgical attention, a few 
stitches and supports, an iron tonic in the form of nails 
and screws, made another creature of it. ... With 
such good-will and purpose did I apply myself to re- 
formatory work that the lame and halt stood without a 
limp, the infirm and decrepit assumed a jaunty air of 
youth, the tramps of the corn chamber became useful 
and reliable members of our household." 

The masculine partner in the firm of the 
" Playmates," whom his companion individual- 
izes by the name of Adam, doubted the pru- 
dence of some of the lady's desperate aims at 
resurrection, and there arose lively controver- 
sies waxing at times into actual opposition on 
his part. She scored a victory in every in- 
stance, as courage and invention deserve to do, 
and flaunted defiantly his own vindicated prin- 
ciple " that economy is the handmaid of the 
art of living." After skimming " off a coating 
of household articles, enough, if spread thin, 
to cover the bareness of the cottage" with the 
help of the long-buried pieces ingeniously 
brought back to life, the couple proceeded to 
set up their penates in the new habitation in 
the wilderness. 

And now had they been ever so " inactive " 
in the past they were so no longer. A second 
tenet in Adam's complex creed was borrowed 
from Emerson : " Labor is God's education." 
The busy pair toiled with delightful earnest- 
ness from this time on. 

" The handmaid as an advance guard preceded us 
with soap and mop, we following at her heels with paint 
buckets and carpenter's tools. We painted floors, 
papered walls, whitewashed ceilings. We repainted 
and covered the furniture, adding curtains, portieres, 
and rugs to the cottage." 

The dilapidated old farm-house speedily as- 
sumed a picturesque aspect under the touch of 
such informed and determined fingers. The 
neighborhood was alive with interest as a 
rational consequence. Visitors would say on 
entering the house : 

" ' Have you done anything new since we were here 
last? We must see it.' Mark the wording; it was 
never ' Have yon bought anything new? ' We made 
it a principle never to buy the smallest thing we could 
construct, and in consequence our talents in that direc- 
tion became enormously developed. ... I, who had 
known only the ennui of city life and social amuse- 
ments, had never conceived of the pure joy this fresh 
plaything brought." 



The final strokes being applied to the in- 
terior, the outer walls of the old house de- 
manded attention. It was decided to shingle 
them. Adam early took a hand in order to 
hasten the slow progress of the carpenters. 
Then Eve, who always wanted to do whatever 
he did, joined in without delay. It proved 
such good fun the carpenters were dismissed, 
and the two " had beautiful hours together, 
each seeing who could do the best work in the 
quickest time." It was with reluctance that 
they gave themselves a respite when both were 
tired out. 

" ' Just hand me a few of those shingles,' he pleaded, 
'and in about three minutes more I shall have com- 
pleted my half of this course.' During the brief re- 
prieve, I became so engrossed with my own end of the 
line that we came nearer and nearer together, until we 
had not only finished the whole course, but had com- 
pleted several more. We did tear ourselves away at 
length, and I got eggnog, or fruit and wafers, generally 
the thing that would take longest to eat, and we sat in 
the shade while we chattered and laughed; and then 
we began the shingling again, which was only play, in- 
terspersed with discussions on philology and Celtic lit- 
erature between the strokes of the hammers." 

Was it not all a pure idyl ? It was bringing 
the ideal into the real. It was making poetry 
out of the prose of life. It was spiritualizing 
the material, an achievement constantly in view 
of the " Playmates," who strove to conform in 
thought and deed to the third prime article in 
Adam's creed : to make each day and each 
event as picturesque as possible. 

The cottage brought into harmony with ses- 
thetic tastes inside and out, the diligent pair 
set to work in the garden, which experienced 
a similar glorification through the instrumen- 
tality of seeds from the florist, and wild vines 
and ornamental trees and shrubs from the 
adjacent forest. Everything grew with won- 
derful luxuriance, because they put of their 
own heart and soul into it. " A miserable 
little thread of a Virginia creeper," for example, 
which had been barely able to keep hold on the 
breath of life in its struggle against thwarting 
circumstances, under their fostering care threw 
out stems and branches to the length of fifty 
feet or more in less than two years, covering 
the front and sides of the cottage with a rich 
green mantle. 

" What a beautiful vine ! ' people would exclaim. 
What do yon do to it ? We have a vine that we have 
tended for years and can't make grow.' ' We love it,' 
would be my reply; and then they would look at me 
with an incredulous smile, not understanding the truth. 
But really there was no further explanation to give, for 
that was all there was to it." 

A unique variation in the Playmates' diver-

sified experiences was the uplifting and re- 
moval of huge rocks which spotted their lawn 
at too frequent intervals. " The gentle game 
of bouldering," the lady pronounces it, and it 
began in this wise: 

" One says to another, My dear, will you come out 
just a moment ? I want you to keep your hand on a 
bar; I have a boulder in the garden that I cannot 
manage alone.' The uninitiated partner thinks on the 
way out, This is a queer thing to ask a woman to do; 
this is a man's work,' which idea shows that she knows 
nothing about the game. She acquiesces, and acting 
under directions, with very little expenditure of power 
on her lever, she takes advantage of every slight gain 
he makes with his pry, and in less than half a minute 
they have laid bare to the sunshine that which is older, 
and has lain longer buried, than the oldest mummy in 
Egypt. This first triumph having been so easily won, 
the newly admitted member of the Society for Exca- 
vation becomes eager for another bout. A wily master 
will play upon the vanity of the neophyte, and will 
render unstinted praise of her skill and dexterity. By 
a proper stirring of her ambition she will ever be ready 
to lend a hand in an emergency. I know one such 
teacher, who by dint of encouragement secured the 
services of an ambitious pupil to exhume fifty boulders, 
some of them weighing a ton." 

It was after much studying of the ways of 
plants and trees in the woods and fields that 
the chronicler of the " Playmates " settled to 
her private satisfaction the great problem of 
the warfare of good and evil in the world. 
While Adam transplanted young cabbages in 
the garden, she unfolded to him the interpre- 
tation of life to which the inequality in con- 
ditions and the tragic struggle for existence 
in the vegetable kingdom, had conducted her. 
It fills one of the most interesting chapters in 
the volume. As she finds seeming injustice 
and real suffering present in the lower ranks 
of being, she is reconciled to their prevalence 
among mankind. It is the law of Nature 
which she robs of cruelty by the supposition 
that the germ of the vital principle of life, that 
which in man we call soul, exists primordially 
in the plant. It rises through ascending grades 
of the organic world in pursuance of the pro- 
cess of evolution until it is fit to inhabit the 
human frame. It then chooses the parentage 
and the environments that will best conduce 
to its continued development. Its destiny from 
the beginning is to go on and on by successive 
reincarnations, each new form starting on a 
level with the highest point attained in its 
last existence. 

" To my mind, this accounts for Nature's apparent 
indifference to the universal death and wanton des- 
truction of life in the world. Death is a token of 
growth the means by which spirit escapes and makes 
its ascent from one form to another. Knowing that 



when a thing dies, death does not involve annihilation 
of the spirit within, but merely facilitates its progress, 
Nature calmly sees one prey upon another, assured that 
the time will come, and it is only a question of time, 
when it will have less maw and more spirit. . . . 
Remember, I do not offer this as final truth, but I do 
claim that it interprets the seeming warfare of good 
and evil, that it gives me increasing peace of mind 
and happiness, and helps me to see a world not suffering, 
but growing." 

One may smile at the insufficiency of the ar- 
gument, but the force and earnestness with 
which it is presented command respect. 

That Adam and Eve are gifted with the 
artistic sense is early divined, but it is not until 
close to the end of her story that she discloses 
her identity with the inventor of the Abnakee 
rug, the manufacture of which forms an in- 
dustry for the comfort and profit of women 
shut away in the lone farmhouses of New 
England. Her account of the studious exper- 
iments which resulted in dyes and designs ap- 
propriate to the exaltation of the original 
crude hooked rug is as piquant and clever as 
everything else she relates. 

The " Playmates " have dwelt three summers 
and a winter in their mountain home, happy 
in each other and in the simple wholesome life 
they have led with the quiet and inspiration 
of Nature around them. " Let us go and do 
likewise," is the involuntary prayer of the 
reader who is allowed in the pages of their book 
a glance into their earthly Paradise.

SONGS OF MODERN GREECE.* 

One of the leading British reviews, in com- 
menting on Mr. Abbott's " Songs of Modern 
Greece," cites his rendering of " The Woman 
of Chios " as proof of the allegation that the 
translator must have done his work poorly. 
The writer for the review in question is evi- 
dently a layman with opinions of his own. 
The truth is that Mr. Abbott's translations 
are remarkably accurate and sympathetic. 
They show evidence of his own familiarity 
with the Modern Greek, and they have been 
touched up by the hand of Mr. Gennadius, for 
years Greek Minister to London, beyond whom 
there is no appeal. 

In reading these translations, one must re- 
member that the soul of poetry is rather asso- 
ciation than meaning of words, and that when

the association does not exist, the effect is lost. 
" The Woman of Chios " calls up a picture of 
girls washing clothing by the sea shore, a 
familiar sight in Greece from the times of 
Xausicaa down, and when a Greek hears it, 
who knows what image it may bring up before 
his mind ? A little village perhaps, his happy 
youth, the fishing boats drifting by, the saucy 
maidens with their lithe bodies and their swing- 
ing paddles flashing in the sunlight as they 
beat the clothes. 

Mr. Abbott has very wisely refrained from 
rendering these songs into rhymed verse. He 
has used prose in most instances and has thus 
been able to keep closely to the original. He 
has rendered a distinct service to the student, 
as many of the words of vulgar vernacular, 
which cannot be found in any of the wretched 
dictionaries in existence, are thus defined, and 
their actual use exemplified. 

This is by no means a complete collection, 
but it gives, on the whole, admirably selected 
examples in the various departments of Modern 
Greek folk song, which is, in its entirety, a 
very rich and interesting field. Several omis- 
sions are scarcely accounted for by the author's 
explanation that he has " avoided including any 
poems previously published in Western Eu- 
rope." The previous collections (Passow, Fau- 
riel, Legrand, Marcellus) are either out of 
print or difficult of access. Lucy Garnett's 
work is next to useless from the fact that the 
Greek text does not accompany the renderings. 

A large amount of space is given over to the 
distiches, those rhymed couplets of which 
every Greek peasant knows a hundred or more. 
These are extremely typical, but they would 
be more worthy of the space occupied if a 
little more care had been used in their selection. 
A prose translation gives a poor idea of a 
rhymed distich. In this case, perhaps the 
original spirit could have been better conveyed 
by means of two metrical lines. Here are a 
few of Mr. Abbott's renderings of these pithy 
poems which are so useful to the Greek swains 
when courting : 

4 ' Even if them wert a queen thou coaldst not be more graceful : 

a flower among maidens, the pride of the neighborhood." 
' ' Mountains bloom not ; birds sing not ; for my love has 

deserted me : mourn ye all." 
" School-mistress, please permit my Helen to come out, that 

I may see her for one instant ; for my life is ebbing out." 
" I want the sky for paper, the sea for ink to write to thee, 

my graceful one, all that passes through my mind." 

The dance songs being intended for occasions 
of unrestrained mirth are often risque, some- 
times quite coarse. Among the idyls and love 
songs, so dear to the heart of the common 



people, are many that are worthy to be trans- 
lated by a poet. Are there not sweet possi- 
bilities in this, entitled " Maria " ? 

" The star of Morn was just beginning to shine sweetly, the 
air to pour forth its perfume on the fair first of May 
before the songs, the sports, and the dances commenced, 
when thou, Maria, earnest forward first, first of all. 

"Thy hair fell in profusion o'er thy milk-white throat, and 
a fair maidenly rose adorned thy breast. 

" A year later I went the same way again, Maria; I passed 
by the desolate church where I saw thee for the first time. 
But, instead of meeting a pretty form, a heavenly, lovely 
glance, my eyes met a white stone with a cross upon it. 

" Alone in the desert I knelt close by thy grave, Maria, and 
kissed it gently. From among the scattered flowers I 
picked one alone a white, pure, and, like thee, virgin 
blossom and matched it to the one which thon hadst 
given me from the garden of lilies for cruel remembrance: 
the one an emblem of death, the other, of youth and beauty, 
and of joy which, here below, is ever sister to sorrow." 

Mr. Abbott's accompanying text is remark- 
ably clear and clean, and he has adopted the 
sensible method of representing elisions by 
means of apostrophes, following the English 
style in such words as " 'tis " and " aren't." 
The comprehension of the foreign reader is 
thus facilitated. 

An introduction and some quite searching 
notes, with numerous classical references, com- 
plete a book that must be a joy to all earnest 
students of that true dialect of Greek which is 
known as " Modern Greek."

ESSAYS ox Music AXD Music CULTURE.* 



Lyric song is the most accessible and widely 
prevalent form of music, since it needs for 
performance no expensive orchestra, stage, or 
chorus, like symphony, opera, and oratoria ; 
yet, notwithstanding that the genius preeminent 
in this sphere must rank with the highest of 
composers, it is a branch of musical art that 
has always been inadequately treated by musical 
critics. " Songs and Song Writers," by Mr. 
Henry T. Finck, is perhaps the first book ever 
written with a view to providing a guide for 
amateurs and professionals in the choice of the 
best songs ; and the author has embodied his 
ideas, theories, and investigations in such a 
manner as to make his volume a very useful 
abstract a sort of omnium gatherum of 
matters pertaining to the Lied.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Although he dwells longest on his favorite 
song writers (Schubert, Franz, Grieg, and 
MacDowell), others are not dwarfed by an 
overbalancing praise of these few. Indeed, it 
may be laid down as a general principle that 
in such books as this the legitimate use of 
comparison stops at illustration and charac- 
terization. As evidence that the author's opin- 
ions evince a thorough knowledge of the subject 
we have but to point to the masterly review of 
Schubert. 

While there may be a few who will contend 
that the popular purpose for which the book is 
designed would have been better served by 
some modifications in the way of both elision 
and amplification, the volume can never be 
classed as a compendium of useless knowledge 
about insignificant composers and antiquated 
songs. Mr. Finck has treated his subject 
conscientiously and enthusiastically, from a 
practical standpoint, and his treatise is just 
what he intended it to be : a sort of Song- 
Baedeker, with bibliographic foot-notes for the 
benefit of students who wish to pursue the sub- 
ject further. 

To try what may be called the emotional 
analysis of music is to offer a direct and peril- 
ous challenge to ridicule and cynicism. In 
view of the inherent difficulties it may seem 
inappropriate, if not unwise, that Camille Bel- 
laigue's volume, "Musical Studies and Sil- 
houettes," opens with lengthy chapters on 
" Sociology in Music " and " Realism and 
Idealism in Music." The author's theory is 
that " to humanize sound " is the mission of 
music, and that it has ever been the effort of 
great musicians of nature to translate into 
melodies, rhythms, and chords the impression 
or the reaction of material things upon us. 

This theory is logical. Was it not because 
Beethoven had felt and suffered all that there 
is in life to feel and suffer that he was able to 
strike chords more full of emotion and pathos 
than have ever been struck before or since? 
Both of the essays referred to evince a tireless 
study of the subjects, and are models of intel- 
ligent criticism ; yet, after all, there is more 
unembellished truth spoken in Joubert's words : 
" The more nearly a note or chord, a melody, 
rhythm, or sonority, touches a human senti- 
ment or a soul, the more nearly is it ideal, the 
more nearly is it real, and the more nearly 
does it attain to the perfection of beauty." 

M. Bellaigue has shown himself to be one of 
the most erudite of investigators into the his- 



tory of music and, more particularly, into the 
annals of opera in France. In fact, he is most 
successful in his studies of the lyric drama, 
and what he remarks has the value of a keenly- 
felt personal impression. But the attitude of 
the worshipper, although sometimes serviceable, 
is not always the best for the critic ; his up- 
lifted eyes are too likely to see only the head 
of fine gold, and to neglect the less noble parts 
of baser material. 

The chapters which furnish the most delight- 
ful reading are " Italian Music and the Last 
Two Operas of Verdi " and " Silhouettes of 
Musicians." Miss Orr deserves credit for her 
admirable translation ; the style is clear and 
forcible, and, above all, she has the gift 
which few translators possess when the subject 
considered is music of always putting the 
right adjective in the right place. 

It has been pointed out that it would be a 
vast gain to the growth of taste, and to all 
forms of art among us, if the present ambition 
to write books on aesthetics might, in some 
greater measure, give place to more serious 
and modest study of nature and standard art, 
as a means of cultivation and for the sake of 
cultivation. In a volume entitled " For My 
Musical Friend," Mrs. Aubertine Woodward 
Moore (whom we used to know as " Auber 
Forestier ") has compiled a series of essays on 
music and music culture. Its purpose is to 
indicate how the rational methods applied to- 
day in other branches of learning may be 
brought to bear on the music lesson, how reck- 
less waste of time and effort may be avoided, 
and how music may gain its rightful place as 
a beneficent influence in daily life. 

Mrs. Moore properly expounds the theory 
that to appreciate music we must possess a 
definite and systematic knowledge of it as a 
foundation, and though she does not tell us so 
totidem verbis, the real object of her book is to 
spread the opinion that such a knowledge 
should form part of general education. It 
would be unnecessary to insist on the value of 
this if it were not widely assumed that assthetic 
appreciation is a mere matter of taste. The 
chapters on " Rational Methods of Music 
Study," " The Technique That Endures," and 
" How to Memorize Music," are alike readable 
and instructive. Her work is pervaded by an 
enthusiasm which gives a peculiar zest to the 
critical portions. The index of twenty pages, 
in addition to a table of contents, is almost 
superfluous. INGRAM A. PTLE.

RECENT BOOKS OF FICTION.* 

Mr. Henry B. Fuller has a keen sense of the 
charm of the unexpected. He has essayed so many 
manners that we anticipate some sort of a surprise 
whenever a new hook appears hearing his name. 
For a time he seemed to delight in the kind of 
realism that is dear to Mr. Howells, and his skilful 
handling of unpromising material elicited our some- 
what unwilling admiration when The Cliff Dwell- 
ers " and " With the Procession " came to hand. 
But the creator of Pensieri-Vani and the Chatelaine 
was obviously a romanticist at heart albeit of a 
fantastic and refined type so that we are not sur- 
prised to find in "The Last Refuge" a reversion 
to the romantic manner. The story opens enter- 
tainingly with the description of a certain Freiherr 
of middle age, who finds his capacity for aesthetic 
enjoyment waning, and who seeks a sort of vicari- 
ous rejuvenation in the companionship of a youth 
in whom enthusiasm is undimmed, and upon whom 
the primal impulses of life act with undiminished 
force. To these two characters others are soon 
joined, each animated by a special idealism, and in 
search of the conditions under which it may be real- 
ized. For one reason or another, the fair island of 
Sicily appears to the imagination of all these people 
to be the spot of which all are in search to each 
of them individually it is a sort of ' last refuge " in 
a hitherto baffled quest. To Sicily they all repair, 
and their paths converge to the same ducal estate, 
where they find themselves gathered together under 
the game roof, and where they indulge in artistic 
revels. We leave the reader to find out the nature 
of these diversions and the upshot of the somewhat 
singular relations that grow up between the char- 
acters concerned. It must suffice us here to em- 
phasize the charm of Mr. Fuller's manner, and the 
fact that he has again (as in his first books) produced 
something that almost deserves the name of a new 
variety of literary composition. No one can hope 
to produce anything really new in literature at this 
late day and under the sophisticated conditions of

modern art, but something approximating originality 
may be predicated of a book that combines sugges- 
tions of Sterne and Stevenson and Mr. Stockton. 
So peculiar a blend as this is not often met with, 
and we give it welcome as a relief from the innum- 
erable story-books written upon conventional lines. 

There could not well be a greater contrast than 
is offered by placing this book side by side with 
Mr. Hamlin Garland's latest novel. Mr. Garland, 
we know by this time, will not surprise us, what- 
ever else he may do. In "The Eagle's Heart " he 
is the same plain blunt man that he was in Main- 
Travelled Roads," and has acquired little more of 
art than he had at the outset of his career. The sense 
of humor was left out of his composition, and of 
the finer graces of style his work has remained ioi- 
pertnrbably innocent. But he has other qualities, 
qualities of earnestness and rugged force, that are 
impressive, and never made by him more impressive 
than in this straightforward story of the wild free 
life of the Western cattle ranges. The cowboy 
period of our Western civilization is fast becoming 
a matter of history, and Mr. Garland has done us 
a service in thus preserving its spirit in a form that 
may make it seem real and vivid to coming genera- 
tions. There is even poetic feeling of a sombre 
sort in some of his descriptive pages, and a realiza- 
tion of the elemental and abiding forces in human 
character. Of characterization in the minuter sense 
in which the art of the novelist understands it there 
is little or nothing. The people of whom he writes 
are not convincing presences the eagle-hearted 
hero possibly excepted but rather lay figures 
decked out in such sentiments and attributes as the 
writer thinks appropriate to them. In a word, they 
are not viewed from within, but rather from the 
outside, and with somewhat unsympathetic vision. 

Dr. William Elliot Griffis has written many ex- 
cellent books of popular history, and is well-equipped 
for this work. But it is one thing to write a con- 
fessed history, and quite another to write a historical 
novel, and for the latter task Dr. Griffis does not 
seem to possess the necessary qualifications, if we 
may judge by his " Pathfinders of the Revolution." 
This book deals with Sullivan's expedition, made in 
1779, into the country of the Six Nations, an ex- 
pedition which broke the power of the Iroquois 
allies of the British, and proved an important fac- 
tor in the eventual triumph of the Revolutionary 
cause. The matter of this book is of great interest, 
and Dr. Griffis has shown himself an accurate 
student of the subject. But his manner, from the 
point of view of the art of fiction, is not that of the 
successful story, and he is obviously out of his ele- 
ment in attempting to write one. A single illus- 
tration will suffice to make our meaning clear. A 
considerable part of the narrative is made up of 
letters from the actors to their friends at home, and 
Dr. Griffis thinks nothing of beginning a letter at 
the end of one chapter, and continuing it into the 
next. The composition must be sawn into equal 
lengths, no matter what the artistic effect.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16, 



Mr. Altsheler is one of the best of our novelists 
of American history, but he has done better work 
than may be found in the book entitled " In Hostile 
Red." The fact that this is an older and shorter 
story revamped into a full-sized novel probably ac- 
counts for its lack of proportion, and its extremely 
uneven quality. It is a story of the Monmouth 
Campaign and the operations in and about Phila- 
delphia just before the retirement of Sir William 
Howe. The central situation is rather effective. 
Two young Continental officers, having captured 
two recently -arrived Englishmen, are led by a reck- 
less impulse to assume the clothes and the characters 
of their captives. Thus transformed, they make 
their way into Philadelphia, and live for some days 
hand in glove with the British officers. At the end 
they make a clean breast of the affair, and are sent 
back by Howe, who is satisfied that they are not 
spies in the ordinary sense. When they interview 
General Washington on their return, they do not 
get off so easily, and spend the following night 
under guard, with the pleasant anticipation of being 
shot at daybreak. Having had their scare, which 
is richly deserved, they are given their liberty. 
The love interest of the novel is supplied by the 
daughter of a Philadelphia merchant, a young 
woman who pretends to be a royalist, but is at 
heart a patriot, and, as such, more than once in- 
strumental in helping the Continental forces to 
carry out their plans. 

"Who Goes There?" by Mr. B. K. Benson, is 
the story of a spy in the serious sense, and the 
time is that of the earlier period of the Civil War. 
The hero is a young man who suffers occasional 
lapses of memory, which may last for months or 
years. One of these attacks comes upon him when 
he is within the Confederate lines, and, as a conse- 
quence, forgetting that he is a Union soldier, his 
recollections revert to the time of his boyhood, 
which had been passed at school in a Southern 
city. He fights for a time in the ranks of his new- 
found friends, when accident restores him to his 
Northern comrades and to the memories that had 
failed him. The psychological part of this study 
is rather clumsily managed as a whole, although it 
becomes effective when it deals with the mental 
struggles of the hero to reinstate the section of 
conscious memory which he dimly feels to be miss- 
ing, but to which no clue seems obtainable. The 
fighting part of the story is given up to a great deal 
of the minute detail of skirmishing, and of battle- 
incidents as they appear to the individual partici- 
pant ; there are no broad effects, and there are no 
episodes of absorbing interest. 

The fourth American war story on our list is the 
" Crittenden " of Mr. John Fox, Jr. Here, at last, 
is a book written in the spirit of art not a great 
book, by any means, but a pleasant one, and dis- 
playing a talent for literature that sets it upon a 
far higher plane than any of the three previously 
mentioned. It is strictly up-to-date in its theme, 



being concerned with the war in Cuba, and having 
the San Juan charge for its culminating episode. 
It takes the popular view of that war and its heroes, 
a view which the author evidently holds in all sin- 
cerity, but which is possible only when we shut our 
eyes to the mad passion which brought the war 
upon us, and to the sinister administrative influences 
that shaped its developments. If we knew nothing 
of these things, we should be carried away by the 
fine enthusiasm of the book, besides being capti- 
vated by its tender poetic sentiment. It is probably 
as wholesome a book as could be made out of the 
material offered by our unfortunate war with Spain. 

" Richard Yea-and-Nay " is a work of fiction 
that seems in strange company when grouped with 
the artificial productions of current romance. It 
is a book of flesh-and-blood, a book of marvellous 
insight into a vanished historical period, a book of 
creative imagination in a very high sense, a book 
which possesses such distinction of style as few 
modern writers have at their command. The judg- 
ment which has prompted so sound a critic as Mr. 
Frederic Harrison to single this book out as pre- 
eminent among all the writings of the past year is 
hardly to be disputed, and those who come under 
the spell of Mr. Hewlett's vivid pages must feel 
that they are in the presence of veritable genius. 
It is not too much to say that the figure of Coaur- 
de-Lion is now made for the first time a real pres- 
ence in the world of romantic reconstruction of the 
past, a saying ventured with all due reverence to 
the memory of Scott, and of such lesser story-tellers 
as have attempted to deal with this complex and 
fascinating personality. And what we may say of 
Richard may be said with almost equal truth con- 
cerning John and Henry the father of both, con- 
cerning the fair Jehane and Berengaria of Navarre, 
and Bertrand de Born, and a host of other person- 
ages. It was the troubadour just mentioned who 
fixed upon Richard the name that serves Mr. Hew- 
lett as a title for his work, and the strange self- 
contradictions exhibited by that masterful ruler are 
portrayed with a power that almost places this book 
in a class by itself. The archaic and incisive char- 
acter of Mr. Hewlett's diction is in itself a triumph 
of art, and the art is one so difficult that it comes 
as a sort of shock to the reader of easy conventional 
romance. One thing is clear : this is no book to be 
skimmed, but one to be read word for word, and 
deeply pondered at that, if the reader wish to pos- 
sess himself fully of its import. 

Thin indeed, and hopelessly unreal, in compari- 
son with Mr. Hewlett's extraordinary production, 
seems such a book as Mr. M. M. Blake's "The 
Glory and Sorrow of Norwich," which is yet a fair 
example of its class, and not so bad a romance after 
all. We would not make it suffer unduly by setting 
it in this unfair juxtaposition, and hasten to say 
that the generality of those who read historical 
fiction for their entertainment will be likely to find 
their satisfactory account in this tale of the days of 



1901.]

the third Edward, the French wars, and the Black 
Death. 

Mr. Albert Lee, who wrote " The Key of the 
Holy House,'' has again taken a theme from the 
history of the Dutch uprising against the Spanish 
oppressor, and produced, in " King Stork of the 
Netherlands," a historical novel of more than usual 
interest and merit. King Stork is, of course, the 
Duke of Anjou, whom the great Prince trusted 
with such unfortunate consequences, and the story 
deals with Spanish intrigue, and the deeds of the 
familiars, and the exploits of the beggars, all deftly 
interwoven with the private romance which gives 
unity to the story. But we feel all the while that 
the real hero is William of Orange, and when that 
heroic leader at last becomes the victim of the 
assassin foiled so many times we care little 
for the outcome of the book as far as the other 
characters are concerned. 

When we reviewed '' A Kent Squire," by Mr. 
Frederic W. Hayes, a few months ago, we com- 
plained that the romance had been hurried to a 
conclusion without resolving half of the perplexities 
in which the plot had become involved. It seems 
that our judgment was over-hasty, for the author 
never really meant to leave us thus unsatisfied, as 
is now evidenced by his " Gwynett of Thornhaugh." 
This romance takes up the threads that were drop- 
ped in the earlier volume, and proves a worthy 
successor to that fascinating production. Its period 
is the year or two following the death of the Roi 
Soleil. and it deals, among other material, with the 
Jacobite rising of 1715, the last impotent efforts 
of Marlborough to turn traitor, and the whole web 
of intrigue that characterized the early years of the 
Regency. The scene is mostly in France, and the 
adventures of Ambrose Gwynett are quite as sur- 
prising as " A Kent Squire " would naturally lead 
us to expect. The Regent himself, however, is the 
most interesting figure of all, and is presented to 
us in a more favorable light than history would 
seem to warrant. The suggestion may seem far- 
fetched, but we have been more than once reminded 
by him of the use which Mr. Sienkiewicz makes of 
the figure of Petronius in " Quo Vadis." That is, 
he says most of the good things, and is the most 
attractive of the characters presented. It has 
seemed to us fair to say that this novel, taken to- 
gether with its predecessor, comes nearer than 
almost any other English product has done to re- 
producing the characteristic charm of the romances 
of Alexandre Dumas. There is the same brilliancy 
of invention, the same intimate familiarity with the 
public and private life of the period concerned, and, 
we regret to add, the same readiness to resort to 
illegitimate sensational devices. Mr. Hayes had 
no need of endowing his hero with quasi-miraculous 
powers ; he would have been interesting enough 
without them. As for the episode of the messe noire, 
we can only say that the grewsome picture offered 
is only in part atoned for by the striking manner of 
the presentation. WLLLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS. 



American 



, and 



Two historical works intended for 
popular reading and instruction have 

beeQ written by Mr . Edwin Erie 

Sparks, associate professor of history in the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. One of these is given the 
timely name of " The Expansion of the American 
People, Social and Territorial " (Scott, Foresman 
& Co.), and is a dispassionate account of the ex- 
tension of the English-speaking people over the 
North American continent, a preliminary chapter 
or two introducing the more specific questions re- 
lating to the United States. In the modern manner, 
Dr. Sparks refrains for the most part from philoso- 
phizing. What philosophy is to be gained from 
the book is hardly that peculiar form of pessimism 
which has been masquerading recently under the 
phrase, " the higher morality," but it is of the sort 
which will give comfort to the advocates of that 
persuasion. In the later chapters of his book, those 
dealing with the recent assumptions by the Amer- 
ican Government of the policies of Europe, Dr. 
Sparks sees only obedience to laws which have, 
throughout history, governed the conduct and decay 
of nations. Judging the future by the past, he 
even prophesies the retention of Cuba as a part of 
the territory under the American flag, with other 
dependencies to be governed in the European man- 
ner, while the United States lays off her garment 
of national righteousness for the uniform of the 
soldier and the acceptance of the title " world 
power " in the continental sense. " We cannot 
escape it," writes the historian, "because we have 
no desire to escape it." The other book from this 
same hand is styled " The Men Who Made the 
Nation " (Macmillan), and is a history in the more 
usual sense. The name given the book is slightly 
misleading. The various chapters bear each the 
name of the leading American of one specific period. 
It is natural to think each chapter, therefore, an 
essay upon the individual whose name it bears. 
Rather is the work a homogeneous whole, begin- 
ning with the voyages of Benjamin Franklin to 
England as the agent of the American colonies and 
ending with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, 
the name at the head of each chapter serving as a 
means of identifying the precise era. The numer- 
ous illustrations in both volumes are appropriate 
and interesting. _ 

During the years from 1891 to 1897 
M - Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer 
gave to the public six ample volumes 
on the history of the different nations of Europe 
during the nineteenth century. The volumes were 
reviewed at length in our columns, and a favorable 
judgment was pronounced upon them as being of 
much interest and usefulness to the general reading 
public. Mrs. Latimer makes no pretensions to 
historical research and disclaims technical training. 
But through a long life she has mingled in the best 
social circles of Europe, and has thus been able to

tell the story of Europe during the century largely 
from the inside, and with the grace that comes 
from such social experience. She has now issued 
a volume made up of supplements to these hooks, 
with the title " The Last Years of the Nineteenth 
Century" (McClurg). From the nature of her 
task the author has not been able to invest these 
brief supplements with the charm of the original 
chatty volumes. They have been compiled from 
newspapers and magazines, and from the notebooks 
of Richard Harding Davis, G. W. Steevens, and 
others, thus lacking freshness as well as the per- 
sonal element. The volume is, however, of value 
for reference where the facts are undisputed, and 
some parts of it are full of interest for the story they 
tell, especially the account of Lord Kitchener's 
Soudan campaign. There is quite a complete nar- 
rative of the Boer war. Altogether, the book is a 
valuable one, and we are glad Mrs. Latimer has 
added it to her series. 

Two more of the compact, pleasant 
little " Beacon Biographies" (Small, 
Maynard & Co.) are at hand, one 
dealing with Thomas Jefferson, from the pen of 
the Hon. Thomas E. Watson, of Georgia, and the 
other with Ulysses S. Grant, written by Mr. Owen 
Wister. Mr. Watson writes a readable book, but 
from the outset seems burdened with the thought 
that his space will not avail for a proper treatment 
of his subject. He avoids controversy, and in doing 
so fails also to present Jefferson as the greatest 
original political philosopher this country has ever 
produced. " I have no space," Mr. Watson re- 
marks in his preface, "for his speculative opinions, 
for his political theories, for his daring suggestions 
in science, mechanical arts, education, and state 
socialism." The collectivists have been saying that 
if Jefferson were alive to-day he would be of their 
number. Mr. Watson here goes further, and his 
own views being well known, it seems a pity that 
he could not have hinted somewhere what it is in 
the great individualist's writings that gives support 
to " state socialism." There seems to be a certain 
lack of sympathy throughout the narrative. But 
the intention to be wholly fair and impartial is also 
manifest, and nothing before the people to-day con- 
tains so much worth reading in as little room, so 
far as Jefferson is concerned. To devotees of the 
leader of the Northern armies, General Grant, Mr. 
Wister's book will doubtless seem lacking in sym- 
pathy as well. To lovers of mankind it will be a 
treasure, and the biographer has done an honest 
and a daring thing in telling the truth. He gives 
the real reason why Grant left the army before the 
war, and shows him as he was in Galena in 1860, 
a man without a future and on the downward grade 
in fortune. From that to the presidency, where 
fortune did not smile upon him, traversing in the 
meantime the heights of military glory, and subse- 
quently receiving the homage of the world in his 
extended tour, thence to his pitiful failure as a 



financier and his partial triumph over death in 
completing his wonderful memoirs, Grant's career 
is eminently human, and can gain nothing by con- 
cealment of the obvious facts. Both of the small 
volumes are carefully printed and bound, charac- 
teristic portraits of their subjects serving as frontis- 
pieces. 

To that interesting series of biogra- 
Thoma* Sydenham, hies known ag Masters of Medi- 
leech and wamor. .,.,-,- \T-VT 

cine (Longmans), Dr. Joseph Frank 
Payne now adds the life of Thomas Sydenham. 
Dr. Payne prepared the article in the Dictionary 
of National Biography on this eminent seventeenth 
century leech and warrior, and the present volume 
is an expansion of that article, much more in detail 
and adding many documents complete from which 
insight into the life of the physician and his times 
can be gained. The times, indeed, were interesting, 
and few did more to make them so than the Syd- 
enhams. They were frankly on the side of the 
Parliament, and Thomas left Oxford before gradu- 
ation in order to take part in the border warfare 
then waging in his native county of Dorset. Later 
the field of revolt broadened and the exertions of 
the Sydenhams with it. Of this family, five brothers 
served on the independent side, Colonel William, 
Major Francis, Major John, and Captain Richard, 
the latter in a civil capacity, ranging themselves 
with Thomas Sydenham, who himself gained the' 
rank of captain, a fact which Dr. Payne has been 
among the first to bring to the world's attention. 
With this goes the further fact of service in the 
second war, after a time spent in the rehabilitation 
of Oxford. The wars over, the trooper went to his 
study of medicine in Montpellier, and thence to 
London, where he accumulated an excellent practice 
and, in good part, prepared those treatises on dis- 
ease which have gained him the world's esteem. 
The book is in every way a worthy one. 

In his recent volume, " London Mem- 
ories " ( Lippincott), Mr. Charles 
W. Heckethorn is not quite so happy 
as in his preceding book noticed last year in these 
columns, " London Souvenirs." It is, perhaps, as 
full of valuable information not easily accessible else- 
where, and it has the distinct advantage of a good in- 
dex ; but the subject matter has not so much living 
interest, since it is less a transcript of life, and houses 
and bridges and priories figure in it more than men 
and women. Some of the chapters are, " Horrors of 
Old London Executions," "Old London Hermi- 
tages," " London's Immortal Animals," and " Wells 
and Springs in Old London," titles sufficiently sug- 
gestive of the character of the book. Mr. Hecke- 
thorn has collected a great deal of matter of curious 
interest and presents it pleasantly, although per- 
haps at times his style has too much the air of col- 
loquial carelessness. For the student of manners 
and customs it will be of real value, and the general 
reader will find in it much to surprise him as well 
as much to give him occasion for reflection, so great

a change have a hundred years made in our ways 
of thinking and doing. Especially interesting and 
valuable is the concluding chapter, "The River 
Thames," touching, as it does, upon so much of the 
living history of the metropolis of the world. 

The brilliant author of "With Kitch- 
London, Parit, ener to Khartum," George W. 

and Berlin. , ' , & . , 

Steevens, succumbed to fever in the 
siege of Ladysmith. Among his posthumous papers 
and some of his " Daily Mail " correspondence, he 
left some racy writing descriptive of three great 
peoples as represented in their capital cities. 
" Glimpses of Three Nations " (Dodd) is the title 
of a volume on London, Paris, and Berlin. The 
hundred pages devoted to the great world centre 
are brimful of information about London as a 
hustling, bustling commercial city. One can almost 
walk the streets and see over again the crowded 
thoroughfares, hear the confused roar of the ve- 
hicles, and experience the unparalleled prevalence 
of dirt. The English people, however, almost en- 
tirely escape characterization. Paris, on the other 
hand, is described in a characterization of its people. 
The boulevards, caf^s, and races, are depicted in 
the manifold and multiplex French character, who 
frequent such places. The author went about with 
eyes and ears open, and with rare skill describes 
just what he saw and heard in the great French 
capital. Berlin receives slight attention, but the 
German people, and especially the army, come in 
for liberal treatment. Precision, plenty of time, 
and authority, seemed to him to be about the most 
striking traits of Germany. The Kaiser's army 
impressed him as the best organized and the most 
formidable among the nations of the earth. He 
was apparently awe-stricken thereby, and sounds a 
note of warning to England. Though somewhat 
scrappy at times these glimpses are good reading. 

^ touching account of filial "piety 
pervades Miss Beatrice Marshall's 
modest biographical sketch of her 
mother, Emma Marshall (E. P. Button & Co.), a 
popular and wholesome writer in the genre of domes- 
tic fiction, whose two hundred or so volumes afford 
a purer and saner form of enjoyment than the 
more highly spiced wares which the popular taste 
now asks for. In more than one regard Mrs. 
Marshall's placid and uneventful, yet in its gentle 
way strenuous and earnest life, recalls Mrs. Oli- 
phant's. It was the lot of both these excellent 
women and devoted mothers to ply unceasingly the 
laboring oar in behalf of their loved ones ; both 
toiled on with unflagging cheerfulness to the end. 
Happily, public appreciation of the fruit of their 
efforts was not lacking ; so that in both cases one is 
spared the painful record of actual privations and 
hope deferred. Mrs. Marshall's life was mostly 
spent in the cool seclusion of cathedral cities, in the 
shadow of their reposeful minsters, and within the 
sound of the chimes which one seems to hear echo-

ing from the pages of the books in which she mir- 
rors the life in these " pleasant places " where the 
spirit of an age more devout than ours still broods. 
The author has divided her narrative under the 
chapter-headings Norwich, Wells, Exeter, Glouces- 
ter, Bristol each chapter thus embracing the 
period spent by Mrs. Marshall in the town indi- 
cated. In fine, the volume is a readable one in its 
unpretentious kind, engagingly written, and strewn 
with letters not uninteresting in themselves and 
worth preserving for the sake of the signatures 
they bear. The pleasing illustrations call for special 
notice. 

We do not know if youths nowadays, 
Life m the even in the sea-board towns, are so 

tnercndnt semce. . . . . . . . 

commonly bitten with the yearning 
to " go to sea " as were youths of a half-century 
or less ago. But to those who are so bitten we can 
honestly recommend Mr. Frank T. Bullen's little 
book entitled " The Men of the Merchant Service " 
(Stokes) as precisely the one for them to read, 
mark, learn, and inwardly digest, before setting 
foot on the first ratline of the arduous ascent to 
maritime prosperity. Mr. Bullen has aimed to 
supply the want of a comprehensive, readable, and 
so far as possible untechnical account of the con- 
ditions of life in the Merchant Service, to which 
the boy who means to go to sea, or who thinks he 
might possibly like to go to sea if only he could 
get a fair notion of what sea-faring is like before- 
hand, may turn with confidence ; and Mr. Bullen 
has succeeded, as usual. Conditions on steamships 
and sailing-ships (Mr. Bullen confesses to a pardon- 
able predilection for the "wind-jammer"), on 
" tramps " and on liners, the duties and qualifica- 
tions of Masters, Mates, Bos'uns, Carpenters, Sail- 
makers, Stewards, Cooks, Able and Ordinary Sea- 
men, Engineers, " Boys " the entire personate 
of the merchantman, in short, are discussed in 
detail, and with the authority of ample experience. 
Mr. Bullen writes most interestingly, and his book 
stops a gap in sea literature. 



A book 
of whale*. 



No better title could have been found 
for Mr. F. A. Beddard's really 
erudite work than A Book of 
Whales " (Putnam). Not only is it all it asserts 
itself to be, but it is the first book in the English 
language devoted exclusively to a popular account 
of these large, useful, and good-natured beasts. 
Mr. Beddard is convinced that the biggest of the 
existing species of whales, Sibbald's rorqual, is the 
largest living creature of which the earth has record, 
not even the Jurassic period with its wealth of 
monstrous reptiles having any brute transcending 
it. While the work is sufficiently technical, it is 
not without much interest from a purely popular 
point of view. A section devoted to the blood- 
thirsty grampus, which fearlessly attacks its larger 
cousins, has some of the fascination of Hugo's story 
of the big squid. It is interesting, too, to read

that evolution seems to point to the ancestral or 
potential whale as being akin to the armor-clad 
armadillo or pichiciago, possibly through the glyp- 
todonts. As a whole the book is clearly written, 
and it is a worthy addition to the " Progressive 
Science Series," of which its author is the general 
editor. 

Some of the " The Red Bad g e * Courage" es- 

great battles tablished the reputation of the author 

of the world. of great Battles of the World" 
(Lippincott). Stephen Crane's vigorous pen pur- 
sued a brief but notable career. It is therefore 
with the greater interest that we examine the con- 
tent of the present volume. Nine great battles are 
described with more or less detail. They are Bunker 
Hill, Vittoria, the Siege of Plevna, the Storming 
of Burkersdorf Heights, Leipsig, Lutzen, the 
Storming of Badajos, the brief Campaign against 
New Orleans, and the Battle of Salferino. But it 
is with a sense of disappointment that we lay down 
the book. The author in most of the cases is not 
the same vivid portrayer of events that we have 
been accustomed to see in his other works. There 
is a kind of unevenness in the style, almost a lack 
of energy in places, that grows wearisome. But 
in a few cases, as those connected with the Swedish 
Campaign, and the battles of Leipsig and Lutzen, 
there is more wholesouledness and movement that 
grips the reader and carries him on to the end. 
This posthumous work will not increase its author's 
reputation, but it is a treasure to his friends because 
it embodies some of Crane's last literary work. 

An argument After an argument between Brain 
forpeaee and Brawn extending through the 

a, again* war. pageg of Mr James jj MacLaren's 

" Put up Thy Sword " (Revell), the author decides, 
somewhat obviously, in favor of peace as against 
war. That such a demonstration should be neces- 
sary at the beginning of the twentieth century is, 
perhaps, the most remarkable thing about the book. 
All the ground has been thoroughly threshed over 
by the wise in former ages, all the pleas for war 
as a development of character have been answered 
by the statement, attributed to President David S. 
Jordan, that all America's wars then should be civil 
wars, in order to give ourselves the entire good of 
them ; and the whole matter seemed settled in the 
estimation of thoughtful men and women long ago. 
But the appearance of this compact little volume 
makes it apparent that there is still demand enough 
for a knowledge of the Ten Commandments and 
the Golden Rule to warrant its publication. 



Letioni in 
rational comfort. 



A sensible and timely plea away 
from the " strenuous life " to one of 
common sense makes up Mrs. Mary 
Perry King's "Comfort and Exercise" (Small, 
Maynard & Co.). The lesson that so many Ameri- 
cans need far more than they do a gospel of nervous 
prostration and paresis is one of rational comfort, 
whether in education, at work, for the home, in 



dress, or during the time for exercise. Each of these 
topics forms a chapter of this pleasantly written 
book ; and it seems certain that our civilization 
would be advanced by the adoption of many of 
Mrs. King's suggestions, even to the point of toeing 
straight ahead instead of toeing out. The best of 
the teaching in the book goes to prove that comfort 
and money are not necessarily synonymous terms, 
a fact which makes all reform in our national 
habits possible if it can ever be realized. 

A readable "Eton" (Macmillan), by Mr. A. 

sketch of Glutton-Brock, is a compendious but 

Eton College. readable historical and descriptive 
account of the famous school where Udall and 
Keate flogged, and Shelley mused, and which Gray 
celebrated in a poem that Dr. Johnson disparaged. 
This is the third volume in the " Great Public 
Schools " series, the object of which is to give a 
brief yet for the general reader satisfactory account 
of these schools as they are to-day. Mr. Glutton- 
Brock outlines in his opening chapters what it is 
essential to know of Eton's historic past ; but his 
space is mainly devoted to describing the present 
buildings, studies, usages, etiquette, sports, and so 
on. The forty-six photographic plates are fairly 
good in their kind. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mrs. Margaret E. Sangster has her own audience, 
gained by many years of careful, thoughtful work. 
Her " Winsome Womanhood " (Revell) carries on the 
work with which her name has been associated, being 
addressed to women of all ages from fifteen years 
onward to the point where, her work as wife and mother 
done, she is " waiting for the angels." Photographs of 
great beauty and artistic posing from the faces and 
figures of beautiful women and girls add to the attrac- 
tiveness of the book, which is one of much spiritual 
significance. 

The sentiments contained in Mr. Austin Bierbower's 
" How to Succeed " (Fenno) do him every credit, and 
the world would be a happier, a better, and a wiser 
place if it should adopt them literally. While lacking 
any striking originality, the book is based on the fun- 
damental moralities of the existing world rather than 
on the teachings of Jesus, which contain too lofty an 
ideal, seemingly, to be " practical." It would be hard 
to imagine a book based on the certain knowledge that 
the rich have no more chance in the Kingdom than the 
camel has to pass through the eye of a needle, with 
the unavoidable inference that riches are to be shunned 
as Heaven is to be sought! 

The Baltimore " Sun " is planning to make a some- 
what more elaborate feature of its literary criticism 
than is usual with daily newspapers. Beginning this 
month, it will have a page or more of such matter every 
week, under the editorship of Dr. Guy Carleton Lee, of 
the Johns Hopkins University, with the collaboration of 
many writers from the various colleges of the country. 
This is the way in which the thing ought to be done, 
and we wish that other journals would follow so excel- 
lent an example.

NOTES. 



" A Shorter Course in Munson Phonography," by Mr. 
James E. Munson, is a recent publication of Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

"An Elementary Grammar of the Spanish Language " 
and " An Elementary Spanish Reader," both the work 
of Mr. L. A. Loiseaux, have just been published by 
Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish " A School Gram- 
mar of the English Language," by Professor Edward 
A. Allen. It is an excellent book, prepared by a man 
who is both a sound scholar and an experienced teacher. 

Herr Heyse's " Das Madchen von Treppi " (Heath), 
edited by Professor Edward S. Joynes, and Herr Hein- 
rich Seidel's " Wintermarchen " (Holt), edited by Dr. 
Corinth Le Due Crook, are German texts recently pub- 
lished. 

Volume IV. of "The Letters of Cicero," in Mr. 
Evelyn S. Shuckburgh's translation, has just been pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Mac mil Ian as a number in the 
Bohn Libraries," for which they are the agents in 
America. 

The Macmillan Co. publish " Miscellanies," by Ed- 
ward FitzGerald, as a " Golden Treasury " volume. 
Most of the matter has been reprinted before, but there 
are a few additions, and we are glad to have " Enphra- 
nor " and the other things in this convenient form. 

The Carnegie Library of Pittsbnrg send us a " Graded 
and Annotated Catalogue of Books in the Carnegie 
Library of Pittsburg for the use of the City Schools." 
It is a most helpful publication, and other large city 
libraries would do well to imitate the example thus set 
for them. 

The Oxford edition of " La Divina Commedia," pub- 
lished by Mr. Enrico Frowde, contains no word of En- 
glish. It gives us Dr. Moore's text and Mr. Paget 
Toynbee's index of proper names, all in a beautifully-; 
printed and tastefully-bound volume at a moderate 
price. 

The Macmillan Co. publish new editions of "The 
Prairie " and " The Pathfinder," in volumes having a 
semi-holiday appearance, with illustrations by Mr. 
Charles E. Brock. We are not informed as to whether 
these two books are the advance guard of a complete 
Cooper, or merely sporadic issues. 

That old-time favorite, Sir George Webbe Dasent's 
translation of " The Story of Burnt Njal," has been re- 
produced by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. in an attractive 
edition, which, we regret to say, omits the maps and 
plans, the appendices and index, and has even cut 
down the preface to much less than its original dimen- 
sions. 

" Cinq Sce'nes de le Come'die Humaine " (Heath), 
edited by Dr. B. W. Wells; Lamartine's " Graziella " 
(Heath), edited by Professor F. M. Warren; Corneille's 
" Nicome'de " (Macmillan), edited by Professor James 
A. Harrison; aud M. Andre* Theuriet's "La Sainte- 
Catherine " (Jenkins), unedited, are the latest French 
texts for school use received by us. 

The American Book Co. publish " The Elements of 
Latin," by President W. R. Harper and Mr. Isaac B. 
Burgess. The same publishers send us other text- 
books, as follows: "Outlines of Roman History," by 
Dr. William C. Morey; a revised edition of the "Man- 
ual of the Constitution of the United States," prepared 
a quarter of a century ago by Israel Ward Andrews, 



and now brought up to date by Mr. Homer Morris; 
and an abridgment of the " Madame The'rese of Erck- 
mann-Chatrian," edited by Mr. C. Fontaine. 

"Abraham Lincoln: His Book," just published by 
Messrs. McClnre, Phillips & Co., is a facsimile repro- 
duction of a small leather-covered memorandum book 
owned by Lincoln during the campaign of 1858. It 
reproduces both the newspaper clippings and the auto- 
graph notes which the owner put into it, and constitutes 
a curious and interesting souvenir of the great President. 

" Who's Who " for 1901 appears with commendable 
promptitude, and is supplied in this country by the 
Macmillan Co. It is indispensable as a book of ref- 
erence concerning living Englishmen, and a sprink- 
ling of American names gives it some degree of special 
usefulness on our side of the Atlantic. But this feature 
does not make our own " Who's Who in America " any 
the less indispensable. 

With close attention to the words and rhythms of 
the original, and an almost exact reproduction of the 
rhymes, Mr. J. M. Morrison has translated " The Poems 
of Leopardi," into acceptable English. Only three of 
the thirty-four " Canti " are omitted from this version, 
which is to be commended for its faithfulness to the 
text, and for the not infrequent felicities of its diction. 
Messrs. Gay & Bird, London, are the publishers. 

The second volume of Mr. Samuel Albert Link's 
" Pioneers of Southern Literature," published by 
Messrs. Barbee & Smith, Nashville, deals with various 
war poets, humorists, and political writers, and with 
one great singer. The chapter on Poe will naturally 
attract the most attention, but the other chapters are 
the more valuable for students of our literature, merely 
because they present much information not easily ac- 
cessible elsewhere.

" / am pleased to meet so frequently thoughtful business and 
professional men who read PUBLIC OPINION every week."

magazine the intelligence of the day as expressed in more than three thousand 
dailies, weeklies, and monthlies. 

DEPARTMENTS : Political, Sociological, Religious, Educational, Scientific, Lit- 
erary, Art, and Financial. This carefully winnowed, tabulated, and systematically 
arranged information cannot be obtained from any other source. 

You can get PUBLIC OPINION for au entire year (price, unless paid in advance, $3.00) and a

CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY 

OF THE 

UNITED STATES 

1765-1895 r 

Illustrated with Map. Analytical Table of Contents and Index. 
By FRANCIS NEWTON THORPE, Ph.D. 

Author of "Constitutional History of the American People, 1776-1850" (sometime 
Fellow and Professor of American Constitutional History in the University 
of Pennsylvania, 1885-1898). 

Three Octavo Volumes, Cloth, $7.50 net. 



This exhaustive work is the result of the continuous labor of more than twenty 
years, and is based upon primary sources of information. It is a biography of the 

American National System of Government 

and is undoubtedly the most complete narrative of our National Constitutional 
History which has yet appeared. It is chronological, without digression or inter- 
ruption, and the story of our National Government is told with consecutiveness, 
clearness, amplitude, and unity. 

The Historical Trinity on the Federal Constitution 

THORPE . . 1765=1895 . Cloth, 3 volumes, $ 7.50 net 
VON HOLST . 1750=1861 . Cloth, 8 volumes, 12.00 net 
TUCKER . . 1628=1897 . Cloth, 2 volumes, 7.00 net 

The variations in the treatment of their theme by these great authors indicate 
strong differences in their works. Mr. Thorpe's books present in a con= 
servative and philosophical manner the orderly development of our 
constitutional system. Von Hoist's work is a master's series of 
studies of political motives and actions, while Tucker's work presents 
a great study in the law of the Constitution. Not one of these masterpieces 
in Constitutional Literature conflicts with the others.

UP FROM SLAVERY. By Booker T. Washington. 

Booker T. Washington's great purpose has been the solving of the many 
problems which surround the "Negro Question," and it is probable that he 
has done more in the direct interest of his race than any other man living. 
This autobiography of his life is simply told, describing his rise from slavery 
to a principal's chair in his institute, without ostentation, although it is 
graphic and convincing. As a book of intense human interest and impres- 
siveness, it cannot be equalled.

THE BEST SELLING BOOK IN AMERICA 

EBEN HOLDEN 

225TH THOUSAND 



By IRVING BACHELLER 



EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN writes: 

" It is a forest-scented, fresh-aired, bracing, and wholly American story of country and town life. . . . 
If, in the far future, our successors wish to know what were the real life and atmosphere in which the country 
folk that saved this nation grew, loved, wrought, and had their being, they must go back to such true and 
zestful and poetic tales of 'fiction ' as ' Snow Bound 1 and ' Eben Holden.' ' 



WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS 

" I have read ' Eben Holden ' with a great joy in 
its truth and freshness. You have got into your book 
a kind of life not in literature before, and you have 
got it there simply and frankly. It is ' as pure as 
water and as good as bread/ ' 

MARGARET E. SANGSTER 

"It is sweet with the smell of the balsam. Whenever 
one finds a real book he or she owes it to the rest to tell 
them about it that they may read and enjoy it too. 
So I pass the ivord along : Read ( Eben Holden .' ' 



THE BOOKMAN (February) says: 

"'Eben Holden' was unquestionably the leading 
book for the month, and was practically in a class by 
itself, probably exceeding in numbers for the ten days 
immediately preceding Christmas any titles issued in 
recent years, excepting in cases of accumulated orders 
given in advance of publication." 

MARY E. WILKINS 

"It seems to me a most remarkable production, 
way and way ahead of ' David Harum,' which is not 
to be mentioned in comparison with it."

AUTHOR OF

English by Rachel Challice 
12 mo. Cloth, $1.50. 



The story is of Spanish provincial life, but 
with a complicated and singularly effective plot 
involving the different political factions of a small 
city. The character sketching is most masterly, 
and the whole written in the crisp, clear style 
for which this author is so justly famed. The 
canvas on which this is drawn is larger than any 
of his previous efforts, but his characters stand 
out with vividness and distinction. Valdes has 
done for the provincial Spanish middle classes 
what Hardy has achieved for the English of 

Wessex.

PUBLIC SCHOOL LEGISLATION 
IN ILLINOIS. 

The attention of the Illinois Legislature will 
soon be occupied by a number of bills relating 
to the State system of public schools, and it 
may be expected that the educational pot will 
boil briskly at Springfield during the present 
month. Besides numerous bills of minor im- 
portance already before the General Assembly, 
there will soon come up for consideration three 



measures of the utmost significance, for the 
consideration of which the legislative mind 
will need all of its wisdom. The measures in 
question are these : First, the appointment of 
a Commission for the purpose of unifying 
and modernizing the school law of the State, 
second, a revision of the so-called pension law 
of 1895, and third, a comprehensive measure 
prepared for the special needs of the school 
system of Chicago. If the Legislature shall 
deal intelligently and soberly with these three 
great questions, the result ought to prove of 
incalculable benefit to the educational interests 
of the community. 

The resolution for the appointment of a 
State Commission is a recognition of the cha- 
otic and patchwork condition of the existing 
school laws. Made from time to time, as 
special exigencies have arisen, these laws have 
never been subordinated to any set of control- 
ling principles, and leave many essential things 
unprovided for things demanded by the 
present condition of public education, and in 
many cases already incorporated into the sys- 
tem, although without express statutory au- 
thority. The school law of the State, in its 
existing form, is a thing of shreds and patches, 
at least a generation behind the age in many 
of its aspects, and self-contradictory at more 
than one point. It is greatly in need of in- 
telligent revision, and now seems likely to 
obtain it. To give but a single instance of its 
shortcomings, we may say that it gives no 
specific authority for schools of secondary edu- 
cation, although public opinion long ago settled 
the question of their justification. What is 
needed in this direction is not merely the 
specific mention of high schools, but a declar- 
ation similar to that of the Massachusetts 
statute, which compels high school education 
to be provided throughout the State for all 
who may desire it. 

The other two measures that are to come up 
for discussion relate only to the schools of 
cities having over one hundred thousand in- 
habitants which means, of course, the schools 
of Chicago alone. This, it may be explained 
to the uninitiated, is the ingenious way in which 
the Illinois Assembly gets around the consti- 
tutional objection to special legislation. Such 
a law, although special in its purpose, is gen- 



130 



THE DIAL, 



[March 1, 



eral in form, and does not contravene the con- 
stitutional prohibition. 

The question of providing pensions or an- 
nuities for retired teachers of the Chicago 
schools does not seem in a fair way of satis- 
factory solution. The existing statute is glar- 
ingly defective, but the substitute about to be 
proposed is very much worse. What is needed 
is a simple law, and the substitute is ridiculously 
complicated. What is needed is a law that 
shall be mandatory in all essential respects, 
and the substitute leaves large discretionary 
powers to an elective administrative board. 
The existing law needs to be amended, but the 
process of amendment should not overload it 
with intricate subtleties, nor should its whole 
spirit and purpose be changed thereby. If the 
Legislature deals wisely with this matter, it 
will make three changes in the present statute, 
and no more. It will make the term of service 
equal for men and women, iti will make the 
annuities proportional to the annual assess- 
ments, and it will remove the slight ambiguity 
now found in the paragraph which secures 
permanence of tenure subject to good behavior. 
With these three amendments, the law would 
be made impregnable as far as the courts are 
concerned, and it would work automatically 
for an indefinite period. It would not secure 
a fixed annuity, but it would secure a fair 
division of the funds annually available among 
the annuitants. To secure fixed annuities of 
reasonable amount, a very different method 
must be resorted to ; namely, the method of 
supplementing the assessments made upon 
teachers by a diversion of public funds to the 
extent found necessary. If the Legislature 
really desires to occupy an advanced educa- 
tional position upon this difficult question, it 
will adopt the method here suggested, and 
might do worse than frame its law upon the 
New York model. We could not well conceive 
of anything that would do so much to increase 
the dignity and stability of the teaching pro- 
fession in Illinois as the adoption of a statu- 
tory provision securing reasonable annuities to 
teachers retiring after a quarter-century of 
service. 

The third measure, and by far the most 
comprehensive one, to come under the consid- 
eration of the Legislature is the bill drafted 
under the auspices of the Civic Federation of 
Chicago. This bill is the product of much 
thought and investigation, and is, in the main, 
an enlightened and admirable document. Year 
before last, a Commission of one hundred mem- 



bers was appointed by the Civic Federation for 
the purpose of examining the whole question 
of legislation for the Chicago schools and the 
allied question of the methods of their admin- 
istration. This Commission was a representa- 
tive body, including in its membership men and 
women, educators and non-educators, clergy- 
men, lawyers, and men of affairs. It has held 
many general meetings and committee meet- 
ings, has called in a great deal of expert testi- 
mony, has listened to much discussion, and has 
at last framed a comprehensive report. A part 
of this report is the bill now before the State 
Legislature; the remainder consists of admin- 
istrative recommendations not suitable for legis- 
lative action, but intended to be addressed 
directly to the Chicago Board of Education. 
It is with the bill alone that we are now con- 
cerned, and a few words may be given to the 
statement of its most important features. 

In the first place, it provides for a reduction 
of the Board of Education from its present 
membership of twenty-one to nine. Such a 
reduction of membership is in accord with the 
best professional opinion in this matter, and 
would bring about the condition of things 
happily expressed by President Eliot when he 
said that a Board of Education should never 
consist of more persons than could sit around 
a table of moderate size, and discuss the ques- 
tions before them in ordinary conversational 
tones. The bill then provides for the super- 
intendency by giving its incumbent a legal 
status, great administrative powers in educa- 
tional matters, and a long term of service dur- 
ing which he cannot be removed except for 
some gross' dereliction of duty. The business 
manager of the schools is also given a legal 
status, enlarged powers and responsibilities, 
and tenure for a term of years. The appoint- 
ment of teachers is vested in the Superintendent, 
subject to preliminary competitive examina- 
tions to test the capabilities of candidates, and 
subject also to confirmation by the Board of 
Education. The certificate of the Chicago 
Normal School is accepted, as is entirely proper, 
in lieu of a special examination, but all appoint- 
ments are made upon probation for three years, 
after which time they become permanent dur- 
ing efficiency and good behavior. 

These are the main features of the plan now 
presented to the Legislature. They are all 
highly desirable features of a school law, and we 
find open to serious criticism only the one pro- 
vision that gives to the Superintendent the 
power, seemingly too arbitrary, of the dismissal 



1901.] 



THE DIAL, 



131 



of teachers, subject to the confirmation of his 
action by the Board of Education. In this 
respect the law now existing is better than the 
one proposed, for it provides a safeguard for 
the teacher in requiring written charges, to be 
investigated by the Board of Education, before 
a dismissal can take effect. It is no more than 
simple justice that this requirement should be 
insisted upon. In voting against it, the Com- 
mission was carried away, in the words of 
" The School Weekly," by the eloquence of 
one or two vigorous personalities who were 
seemingly controlled by two ideas to the exclu- 
sion of all others. " One was that the Chicago 
school system was going to the dogs because of 
a surplus of incompetent teachers. The second 
was that giving to the Superintendent of Schools 
supreme power would remedy all this." The 
simple fact is that it ought to be difficult to 
dismiss from the schools a teacher who has 
passed the probationary period. Make it as 
difficult as you will for a person to secure ap- 
pointment, make the tests as exacting as you 
please, but when the appointment is given, let 
there be given with it a sense of security that 
cannot possibly coexist with the power of any 
one officer to destroy a professional career once 
entered upon in good faich. It is only upon 
these terms that a really effective service can 
be built up ; it is only subject to this condition 
that the best class of men and women can be 
persuaded to enter the educational ranks. 

What the fate of this measure will be at the 
hands of the Legislature we do not pretend to 
say. If we may judge by the fate of the not 
dissimilar bill presented two years ago, the 
outlook is not hopeful. That bill, like the 
present one, was in the main admirable, and 
needed, like its successor, only a little judicious 
amendment to be made a model example of 
educational legislation. But instead of intel- 
ligent consideration, it received only derision, 
it was assailed by interested persons in all sorts 
of mean and petty and unworthy ways, and 
was finally rejected with contumely. Let us 
hope, at least, that the General Assembly now 
in office will have a better sense of its dignity 
and responsibility, and that the new measure 
will be accorded the respectful attention it so 
richly deserves. Its enactment, after some 
slight revision, would set Illinois in the front 
rank, as far as educational interests are con- 
cerned, among our Commonwealths, and would 
doubtless become, as our Library Act of nearly 
thirty years ago has become, a model for the imi- 
tation and the emulation of other communities. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"A DISTRESSING MISQUOTATION/' 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL) 

A correspondent (" S.") in your issue of February 1 
tartly refers to what seems to him a lapse ou the part of 
the editor of " An American Anthology." One of Poe's 
" gems " he finds to be " marred by one of the most dia- 
bolical blunders of misquotation in all the annals of 
printing." Quoting, from "To One in Paradise," 
" And all my nightly dreams 
Are where thy dark eye glances 

And where thy footstep gleams," 

he truthfully states that, " instead of dark ' eye, Mr. 
S ted man has gray eye." 

If " S." will consult the Stedman-Woodberry edition 
of Poe's Works (the latest complete text), he will see 
that " gray," and not " dark," was the adjective finally 
used by the author of " To One in Paradise." Doubt- 
less Poe might have stuck to his early draft of that 
ballad, instead of carefully rewriting it, if he could 
have known that " S." was to say of " gray eye glances " 
that the " distressing alliteration would have ruined the 
fame of Milton." 

On page 190, Vol. X., of the Edition cited, the vari- 
orum notes show the poet's many radical emendations, 
one of which is the substitution in question. After 
my labors with Professor Woodberry in the editorship 
of Poe, I could hardly be expected to prefer any text 
before our own, and I would be apt to scrutinize the 
proof of selections therefrom with unusual care. One 
of the claims of our text to the title of "definitive" 
is that it follows Poe's own copy of his last book of 
verse, with the marginal revision by his own hand. 
Occasionally his changes from a crude early draft are 
open to criticism, but nineteen times in twenty they are 
most felicitous (as in the ballad of "Lenore"). Pos- 
sibly this may not be said of the change from " dark " 
to " gray," yet it will be recalled that Poe had a pas- 
sion for alliteration, and, again, that such a change was 
sometimes determined by other than technical consid- 
erations. In standing by the text of the " Anthology," 
I may be guilty, but certainly not of the " blunder " 
which is proverbially worse than a crime.

DR. FITZEDWARD HALL: AN APPRECIATION. 



(To the Editor of THE 

Apropos of the recent death of Dr. Fitzedward Hall, 
some brief public expression of appreciation of his ser- 
vices to students of modern English may be fit and 
proper, especially as coming from a controversial op- 
ponent. My controversies with Dr. Hall, although con- 
tinuing through several years, have passed from notice 
and, except for a few, from memory. But I have long 
wanted to say something of this kind, and I hope it may 
be said in THE DIAL, because most of the discussions 
between Dr. Hall and myself were printed in its columns. 

It is not necessary to enlarge on Dr. Hall's attain- 
ments, his enormous industry, the breadth of his reading, 
the acuteness of his perceptions, the subtlety and truth- 
fulness of his distinctions. Nobody, I suppose, has ever 
examined his printed work in English without astonish- 
ment at the mere labor that produced it. Its solid 
value is unquestionable, in fact, incomparable. Dr. 
Hall was the first to show how questions of good and 



132 



THE DIAL 



bad English (to refer to a single line of his pursuits) 
must be studied in order to reach safe conclusions. If 
anybody ever got a slight and temporary advantage 
over Dr. Hall in discussions of this kind, it was because 
he had learned the art frt)tn his master, Dr. Hall him- 
self. It is no wonder that Dr. Hall's authority became 
almost papal. I have spoken of his acuteness and 
subtlety. He did more than anybody else, more 
perhaps than all others, in bringing to the attention 
of American readers obscure, unsuspected differences 
in sense between American and British uses of the 
same words. He himself was keenly alive to such 
differences, and combated strenuously the prevalent 
notion in the United States that the differences between 
British and American English are slight. 

Dr. Hall's studies were not restricted to English. 
He printed much in other departments. But of this I 
do not venture to speak. It seems to me very desirable 
that Dr. Hall's letters and contributions to periodicals 
should be re-printed in book form for the shelves of 
libraries. RALPH OLMSTED WILLIAMS.

PROFESSOR TRIGQS ON PROFESSOR WENDELL. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The communication of Mr. Oscar Lovell Triggs in 
THE DIAL of February 16, concerning Professor Bar- 
rett Wendell's " A Literary History of America," point- 
ing out " the strength " on which he brought himself to 
consider this volume, is more complimentary to the 
writer of the editorial in THE DIAL of December 16 to 
which Dr. Triggs refers, than to Professor Wendell's 
standing in literary and educational circles, perhaps; but 
before questioning the questioner I must cry mea maxima 
culpa, since Pmust be uncomplimentary myself and ac- 
knowledge that I have read neither editorial nor book. 

However, it has struck me as something to be regret- 
ted that Mr. Triggs should have seemed to have con- 
founded his desire to communicate, with his desire to 
review Professor Wendell's book, and Mr. Triggs's 
eight little paragraphs of big questions scarcely appear 
as food for thought so much as for a pedagogic exami- 
nation test. 

If it is the function of a pedagogue to put questions, 
it is supposed to be his function to be able to answer 
them. It is forbearance then on the part of Mr. Triggs, 
perhaps, that he has not embodied these questions with 
others, all answered, in a definitive review or a volume 
on the same subject. At least I imagine the time has 
not yet come for a precise history of our literature, when 
Professor Wendell's sins of literary omission shall be 
made forgotten. 

If Mr. Triggs actually expects his eight series of 
questions to be answered, one might remind him, con- 
cerning one question of the second, that English litera- 
ture has two meanings. The term may be interpreted 
as literature in English or as literature in England. I 
believe Professor Wendell would have the former sig- 
nificance in mind in writing such a book as " A Literary 
History of America," and that may account for his non- 
consideration of Yiddish literature in America. 

Perhaps Professor Wendell's volume is out of place 
in its series, " conceived by an European from an Euro- 
pean point of view," yet not more out of place than a 
literary ambassador at the court of St. James. Just 
what Dr. Fiske's not being dazzled by kings and queens 
would have to do with a conscientious effort on the part 



of Professor Wendell, is problematical, yet Dr. Fiske 
and the others have been wise enough to consider kings 
and queens, and it is not uninteresting to note the effect 
King George III. of Great Britain and Ireland had on 
the life work of Mr. George Washington of Mt. Vernon 
and elsewhere. At present it is a question whether a 
preface should exclude a text, but there is the consola- 
tion always that second editions are possible. 

As to devoting 479 of 518 pages (this may include 
the index; I do not know) of a volume of the sort to 
BOSTON (and New England), one must cry out " Let 
the Punishment Jit the Crime!" Let Professor Wendell 
be compelled to demand a new edition of his book 
wherein a certain number of pages shall be devoted to 
chronicling the literary doings of the United States 
county by county, parish by parish, each county and 
each parish having its own section. But where a county 
or a parish has no literature to present, let the pages 
assigned to such a county or such a parish remain blank, 
or decorated with an appropriate quotation from Walt 
Whitman or Homer's catalogue of ships. In this man- 
ner a comprehensiveness might be attained of great in- 
terest to a leisurely statistician. Finally, let Professor 
Wendell apologize for forgetting to mention that the 
West has been won ! 

As soon as I finish reading Mr. Triggs's excellent 
" Selections from the Prose and Poetry of Walt Whit- 
man," I will lend it to " Mrs. Harris," and " Mrs. 
Harris," who is now reading Professor Wendell's book, 
will exchange with me. Perhaps when I come to read 
" A Literary History of America " myself, I will under- 
stand Mr. Triggs's temptation, but the form of his com- 
munication seems to me to be in need of absolution.

OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES: A SUGGESTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I have place in THE DIAL for a word to say 
that I think the work of our public libraries, which you 
discuss so sanely in your issue of Feb. 1, does not properly 
cease at the circulating point. Especially, in the larger 
cities, it seems to me, there should be free reading 
rooms in several different parts of the municipality, 
accessible for all classes and at all reasonable times of 
the day and evening. The reading room would seem 
to supplement the circulating feature and add to the 
usefulness of the library as a whole. The free reading 
room at a central point is practically foreclosed against 
that class who most need its advantages. The laboring 
people cannot go from their homes on the outskirts of 
the city and get much good from reading after they 
have done a full day's work and taken their evening 
meal. Besides, the item of transportation is not incon- 
siderable for the poorer intelligent classes. And an 
opportunity to keep in touch with current events as 
they appear in daily and weekly papers, and in the 
periodicals, ought not to be denied this important and 
large part of our population. The free reading room 
will do much to lessen gambling and drunkenness, and 
is a wise policy for any municipality to foster viewed 
merely from the economic standpoint. It is a work 
that should provoke the active interest of philanthropic 
persons. It is somewhat singular that this democratic 
move has not awakened a greater impetus among those 
to whom the stewardship of great wealth has been en- 
trusted. DUANE MOWRY.

THE LIFE OF PHILLIPS BROOKS.* 

Dr. Allen has given us a remarkable biog- 
raphy in his " Life and Letters of Phillips 
Brooks." He has portrayed a remarkable 
man. Perhaps no richer personality has ma- 
tured on American soil. The biography has 
great excellences and some obvious faults. 

Like most such works in modern times it is 
excessive in bulk. As if Hesiod had never 
lived, writers refuse to consider the half to be 
more than the whole. Publishers protest and 
readers complain, but still the volumes grow. 
Sixteen hundred closely printed pages are a 
good many to devote to one man. They might 
suffice for the chronicle of an important period. 

If Carlyle thought the days of hero-worship 
past he should be living at this hour. On 
every page of these volumes are heard the 
trumpets and shawms. The misfortune of being 
idolized which pursued Phillips Brooks through 
his lifetime follows him to his grave. While 
he lived he overtopped the curling incense, 
and he emerges unharmed above it even now. 
You distinguish the man with all his noble 
features even when set forth as a demigod. 
It may heighten the verisimilitude of the por- 
trait to give it the atmosphere which Phillips 
Brooks breathed for thirty years. Yet above 
his dear remains there are those who would 
prefer to see a more severe and chastened 
monument. 

Nor did the career and personality of Phillips 
Brooks require copious interpretation. Some 
people need no introduction. Before a great 
landscape, a great picture, a great man, silence 
is the more reverent homage. The admirable 
cicerone irks us ; our admiration is chilled be- 
cause demanded. We are ready to resent the 
intrusive interpretation and to look the other 
way. Give us the facts of the great man's life, 
what he said and did, what he enjoyed and 
suffered, the things he liked, the things he 
hated, and let us sift and group them and make 
our inferences from them as we may. 

Let us not be thought ungrateful. Happily 
in these volumes there is much to praise. After 
throwing out all that is redundant and irrele- 
vant, there remains a true vision of a noble 
man. Dr. Allen knows him as he was. When 
we doubt the biographer's judgment he has

ander V. Q. Allen. In two volumes. New York : E. P. Button 
&Co. 



himself supplied the material upon which to 
form our own. He has made large use of 
carefully kept note- books and diaries whose 
existence was unsuspected by lifelong friends, 
and has drawn so much from them that these 
volumes might bear the old-fashioned title, 
" Life and Remains." The notes are not shape- 
less memoranda, but well-wrought paragraphs, 
not to be likened to the scrawls of an artist's 
sketch-book but to delicate and finished draw- 
ings. They indicate in the writer a character- 
istic sense of form and instinct for perfection. 
There is wealth without exuberance. Before 
Phillips Brooks was of age he had learned his 
tools and was a master of expression. The 
earliest notes no more spurt with the spasmodic 
cleverness of youth than the latest dribble with 
the enforced parsimony of age. It is the flow 
of a quiet stream, welling up and gliding on: 

The letters are numerous, not often import- 
ant or brilliant, but delightful with the charm 
of slipshod ease. They are anybody's letters, 
not a touch of art about them. They are full of 
most gracious fooling. Precisians will regard 
them as unduly frolicsome. They touch and go 
lightly. They are not crammed with wit or 
wisdom. They are not often quotable. For 
axioms or epigrams you must look elsewhere. 
They are for a friend's amusement, for the 
writer's relaxation. They are like good talk, 
and especially like Phillips Brooks's good talk, 
which mostly kept the valley road. When he 
would climb peaks or thread crevasses he wrote 
a sermon or made an entry in a note-book. 
The fire kindled when he mused rather than 
when he chatted. He said what came to the 
surface and let his fancy loose. If too many 
began to listen, the talk was apt to dissolve in 
laughter. 

Was the great preacher's nature as complex 
as Dr. Allen imagines ? The public instinct is 
with those who look on it as essentially simple, 
as simple as his career, which was only except- 
ional in its felicity. Born in the Brahmin 
caste of New England, he inherited through 
half a dozen generations piety, scholarship, and 
public spirit. He grew up in a household 
which added deep conviction to plain living 
and high thinking. His mother was a woman 
of rare almost tragic intensity of spirit. 
His father was a Boston merchant of the best 
stamp, energetic, orderly, diligent, unpretend- 
ing, a man content with a modest livelihood, 
of sound sense and conservative judgment, glad 
to reserve strength and leisure for public aims.

School Phillips Brooks passed to Harvard 
College. Unambitious of college rank, but 
alert and eager for knowledge and culture, he 
stood high among his classmates, winning their 
liking while retaining a certain aloofness and 
reserve, which in after years wore off the sur- 
face yet clung to the core of his being. After 
an attempt to teach rough and indocile lads, 
which proved a failure and caused momentary 
discouragement Dr. Allen has perhaps dwelt 
on the mishap somewhat unduly, he found 
his lifework in the ministry of the Episcopal 
Church, in which, from four years old, he had 
grown up. He passed three years at a Semi- 
nary of that church near Alexandria, Virginia. 
They were years of quiet growth, unincumbered 
by too much instruction. Some men are 
their own best teachers, and Phillips Brooks 
"browsed on the sprouts of his own mind," 
pursued his own studies, began to value and 
record his thinking, and came into knowledge 
of himself. At his graduation he was so easily 
first among his fellows that there was no doubt 
of his ultimate rank in the ministry. After 
two years in a somewhat obscure post where 
he could not be hid, he took charge of one of 
the foremost parishes in the church, that of 
the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia. He was in 
no haste to assume larger tasks, but he had no 
fear of them. Under the influence of a great 
position at a momentous period, the years of 
the Civil War and of Reconstruction, he grew 
rapidly. He stood firmly for the Union and 
for the Freedmen, when it cost something to 
be outspoken. After ten years of rich service, 
being not yet thirty-five years old, he was 
drawn back to his native city, there for two and 
twenty years to preside over an historic parish. 
But he insensibly widened his pastorate to in- 
clude all who called upon him for his ministries 
in Boston and parts adjacent. In the great 
fire of 1872 his church was burned. The 
seeming catastrophe became a blessing. It 
precipitated a difficult decision to remove an 
old parish to a more favorable neighborhood. 
Four years later there had risen, under the 
spell of his eloquence, at the hands of a large- 
minded and generous corporation, using the 
unique gifts of Richardson the architect and 
Lafarge the painter, a building that marks 
an epoch in our architecture, the noblest church 
edifice yet built in this country. The building 
and the man who had no small part in making 
it what it was went well together. It was 
thronged with all sorts and conditions of men, 
to whom his word was life. There he was as 



if enshrined or enthroned for the rest of his 
days, and now it is his monument. It seemed 
as if no more changes could come to him, but 
upon Bishop Paddock's death in 1891, by 
common consent of city and state Phillips 
Brooks was marked as his successor. Those 
not of his own communion claimed him as " our 
bishop." There was some delay in the con- 
firmation of the election by the standing com- 
mittees and the bishops. Dr. Allen has told 
the story with little comment. He has declined 
to erect a pillory in his pages, however just 
the right of anyone to occupy it. 

Phillips Brooks did not seek the episcopate, 
yet rather to the surprise of some he welcomed 
it and rejoiced in a new opportunity. He felt 
it also to be a release from crushing burdens. 
But he had not fully measured its own strains. 
He set himself an exacting standard of official 
duty. He was already overwrought when dis- 
ease struck an enfeebled frame and found him 
an easy prey. He died after a few days of 
illness, on the 23d of January, 1893. He was 
fifty-seven years old. 

It was a career whose events were sermons, 
addresses, lectures, changes of rectorships, 
refusals of parishes, professorships, and presi- 
dencies, the building of a great church, and 
the consecration as Bishop. Its relaxations 
were books, friends, and foreign travel. It 
differed from other ministerial careers less in 
kind than in degree. So with the character 
formed and revealed by it. It differed from 
the characters of other men in the range, pro- 
portion, and completeness of its powers. It was 
pure, high-minded, devoted, earnest to enthusi- 
asm yet ever sound and sane, the temperament 
and force of genius combined with saving com- 
mon sense, the habits of industry, fidelity, 
patience, sobriety, which ensure success in 
whatever field. A large intellect, a right con- 
science, a commanding will, a noble heart, were 
fitly tabernacled in a mighty frame that worked 
without jar or friction almost to the end. The 
whole grand nature was subdued and conse- 
crated to the one task of living and proclaiming 
the gospel of Christ. If just balance, and 
equipoise of powers or their concentration upon 
the highest aim, involve subtlety, the character 
may be deemed complex ; otherwise it was 
simplicity itself. 

Very early in his life Phillips Brooks recog- 
nized his peculiar powers and the work to which 
they pointed him. It was not the mission of 
the seer who declares truths which perhaps 
only posterity may comprehend at their just

value. It was rather that of the prophet who 
discerns in the religion of his time eternal 
verities, needing restatement ; who takes the 
lessons of all time and makes them live again 
to-day. What the marvellous preacher was 
capable of becoming as a metaphysician deal- 
ing with fundamental thought, what he might 
have been as a formal theologian eliciting from 
Holy Writ its essential dogmas and system- 
atizing Christian Truth, it is idle to inquire. 
Genius is a well-nigh incalculable force, and 
may apply itself in numberless directions. 
Anyone who would judge the capacity of Phil- 
lips Brooks for abstract thought upon religion 
may well study the ten pages of the second 
volume of this biography, in which to clear 
his own mind he reviewed his religious experi- 
ence and put on record his inmost convictions 
in theology. Nothing could be simpler or more 
lucid. But while we may believe his genius 
capable of many things which it left unat- 
tempted, we must see that its special province 
was to take great truths out of the rubbish 
heap of dead phrases, revitalize and freshly 
illustrate them, and cause them mightily to 
prevail over the hearts and lives of men. There 
was power for men to live by, if it could only 
get at them, in the old theology that in this 
period of the New Reformation was everywhere 
finding restatement and elucidation. What 
had grown obscure and was in danger of be- 
coming obsolete, what had been familiar in 
words and was in danger of passing into the 
realm of cant, what was really new in its form 
and was in peril of becoming a heresy by 
standing alone, Phillips Brooks seized with a 
certain swift and fine apprehension and re- 
deemed for the service of life. That was his 
peculiar province in which he stood peerless, 
the application of truth to common living, 
bringing Jesus Christ, with all the glow of 
divine light upon His face, down among every- 
day men and things. As he believed in God 
the Father of a world of men, so he believed 
in man the potential Son of God. For the 
lowest, meanest, most germinal type of hu- 
manity, he cherished an undying hope. 

That large hopefulness was perhaps the 
salient feature in the character of Phillips 
Brooks. Other men were as brave and devoted, 
but who was ever as hopeful as he? When 
others walked in darkness anxious well-nigh to 
despair, on his face there was no " glimmer of 
twilight " but ever " glad, confident morning." 
Transient sorrows might disturb, immediate 
difficulties might perplex him, but he had 



never a doubt as to the final issue. Such sure 
hope was with him both a native gift and a 
Christian grace. And out of such hope grew 
joyousness irrepressible, lightness of heart free 
and frolicsome as that of a child. It was cheer 
and courage for all about him. It was a per- 
petual fountain sparkling in the sun and water- 
ing every thirsty grass-blade and wilting flower. 
Whether he outstretched his hand to greet a 
friend, to console a mourner, to lead a prodigal 
home, there was a thrill in the grasp as of a 
strong glad son of God, delighting in His 
service. 

How quietly Phillips Brooks rose above or 
stood apart from contentions and controversies! 
The unruffled atmosphere of Dr. Allen's biog- 
raphy is in just keeping with the life por- 
trayed. Some remote murmur of battle past 
seems dying away in the distance, but around 
the great central figure of the scene there is 
truce or peace. Always independent in opinion 
and frank in utterance, Phillips Brooks was 
never bitter in speech nor did he nurse grudges 
in his heart. If he ever seemed to over- 
emphasize a truth or unduly reject what he 
thought an error, his spirit was always gener- 
ous and tolerant. Nor was it the tolerance of 
arrogant unconcern but of honest respect and 
sympathy, of hearty recognition of neighbor's 
right to question what it was his own duty to 
assert or acclaim. He rarely laid stress on the 
things he rejected. He was busy inculcating 
what he believed God's truth. There might 
be tempting occasions for firing a volley after 
a retreating foe, or rolling the drums and flut- 
tering the flags after an enforced surrender, 
but Phillips Brooks had neither time nor heart 
for such things. Dr. Allen, with a large wis- 
dom which is habitual to him, tells the story at 
such times without provocative comments. In- 
deed, there are pages where the reader is dis- 
posed to inject a little human temper between 
the mild benignant lines. 

It will be a pity if the younger clergy the 
young men, indeed, of every calling fail to 
note the lesson of Phillips Brooks's systematic 
and orderly industry. If ever man might trust 
to slight preparation, it was he. His mind 
worked at lightning speed. Lucid utterance 
seemed instinctive with him, and logical ar- 
rangement. Thoughts never tumbled forth 
from his mind like apples from a barrel or 
jackstraws from a box. They fell in place. 
From a seminal thought sprang with the ra- 
pidity of East Indian juggling the stem, 
branches, and terminal twigs of a shapely tree,

each leaflet and each rootlet where the laws of 
tree life require that they should be. I once 
saw Phillips Brooks compelled to exercise on 
the instant his faculty of quick choice and in- 
stantaneous mastery of a theme. Before a 
large audience he was suddenly called to his 
feet after a definite promise that he should not 
be. Only on that assurance had he consented 
to be present. Unfortunately the promise had 
come from a venerable presiding officer, and 
the call, peremptory and irresistible, issued 
from a tumultuous throng of young men. As 
the cries for " Brooks, Brooks ! " rang out, I 
saw his face darken, his eyes seemed to look 
inward for one swift instant, his whole frame 
quivered and his whole being gathered from 
all sides its forces to concentrate them upon an 
intense process of thought. Then he rose, 
drew up that grand form of his to its full 
height, and as quietly as if the scene had been 
rehearsed beforehand seemed to distribute his 
ideas each into its fitting place and began an 
address as logical in order, as substantial in 
matter, and as choice in phrase as if he had 
given hours instead of seconds to its prepara- 
tion. With such electric facility, such gift of 
instantaneous summoning up the forces of the 
brain, most men would have felt diligent and 
laborious preparation for them needless. Phil- 
lips Brooks never trusted to his genius until 
humbler powers had done their part. He held 
it in reserve to fuse into a glowing whole what 
diligent study and thought had accumulated. 
He was as careful and methodical as if he had 
been dull and undisciplined. His study-table 
was never " snowed under." It was as neat as 
a lady's dressing table, as a precise bookkeep- 
er's desk. Its orderliness was typical. 

Dr. Allen very discriminatingly notes the 
autobiographical character of Bishop Brooks's 
sermons and lectures ; how he confided to the 
great popular heart what he would withhold 
from close personal friendship. What he saw 
in himself, with the inward eye which is the 
bliss of solitude, he revealed as if it belonged 
to all mankind. He was not unaware of his 
own genius. He knew well enough his relative 
place among men. But he perpetually lost 
sight of it. He was a somewhat stern judge of 
his brethren in the ministry if they fell below 
his ideal of what a minister should be. So 
easily was he all he was, that he forgot that to 
lag very far behind him might sorely hurry 
the pace of those less gifted. So as he gave 
glimpses of the history of his soul it seemed to 
him that he was only portraying the common 



processes through which his fellows went, and 
he made it seem to them as if they had already 
trod where he was leading them. Thus his 
noblest sermons, so far from dismaying his 
brethren with the thought of their incomparable 
power, were to many among them but an inspi- 
ration. 

Justly has Dr. Allen emphasized Phillips 
Brooks's relation to his own church and to the 
Christian world beyond it. So much was he 
at last " the Bishop of Massachusetts " to mul- 
titudes who regarded Episcopacy askance, to 
whom his orthodoxy was incomprehensible and 
his churchmanship a curious and unaccountable 
accident, that men of his own flock and creed 
were not unnaturally disposed to question his 
fealty to his own flag and to ask, Can this 
man be quite loyal to the Church of the Prayer 
Book, who is the accepted leader of unliturgical 
Christendom? If they will read his little 
tractate on " Tolerance " they will be better 
able to understand him. His attitude toward 
his own communion and that of others may be 
well illustrated in words of Daudet quoted by 
Rene Dourmic. 

" Truly I belong to my own boat and I love it, but 
all those others setting sail or entering port are as dear 
to me as my own. I signal them, I hail them, I try to 
hold communication with them, for all of us, whether 
leaders or followers, are threatened by the same dan- 
gers; for all our barks the currents are strong, the 
winds -treacherous, and the night comes down so fast." 

Ah, too fast that night came down, it well 
may seem, on one so well loved and trusted, 
who bore so clear a light and shone so far. 
The world was indeed indefinitely the poorer 
by his departure as it had been indefinitely 
richer for his sojourn. But for him it was well 
to go. He had done his work. He had sown 
seed of which coming generations will reap the 
harvest. He enjoyed life, few men more 
keenly. Speaking of one who lingered a little 
late upon the stage, he wrote, " One would not 
like to stay quite as long as he has, but, with 
the world such as it is, there is great tempta- 
tion to linger at the feast." " Such as it is," 
the world of men and things was very dear to 
him. It was far from a perfect world, but 
there was much in it richly to enjoy. His 
Father spread a generous table and he could 
tarry the Lord's leisure about the board. But 
when he heard that Agassiz was gone in his 
" fresh, joyous, simple " prime, he thought of 
him as " falling without decay and setting 
without twilight." And when Sumner a few 
months later fell, his mood was akin to that of 
Huxley when he said of a friend who had

" vanished in the middle of an unfinished art- 
icle," " after all, that is the way to die, better 
a thousand times than drivelling off in a fatu- 
ous old age." With Phillips Brooks we might 
have looked for a long autumn of ripening and 
golden days, but God saw otherwise. The 
grand frame crumbled before one touch of de- 
cay had fallen on the splendid intellect, the 
commanding will, the warm throbbing heart. 
So best. The sun went down unquenched. In 
some memories will long linger a tender after- 
glow. The world will go on and seem to for- 
get Phillips Brooks. His matchless eloquence 
will be but a tradition. His thoughts will 
pass into the common fund, be but an element 
in the air that coming generations breathe. 
But his spirit will not die. His work will last

Heaven. Q A . ^ R ICH ARDS. 



ORIENTAL, RUGS AND RUG MAKING.* 

From time immemorial the weaving of car- 
pets and rugs has been the chief manufacturing 
industry pursued by the peoples inhabiting a 
large part of southwestern Asia. The fabrics 
produced by these peoples have always been 
highly prized both for their serviceable quality 
and as works of art. Few products of human 
skill have equalled the best of them in beauty 
of coloring. Choice specimens are eagerly 
sought after and treasured by collectors ; lovers 
of them are counted by thousands, for what 
person of taste is insensible to their charm ? 

Hitherto, accurate information about the 
different makes and makers has been well-nigh 
inaccessible. The principal source of knowl- 
edge has been the statements of native dealers, 
themselves not always well informed, nor free 
from the proverbial unreliability of their kind. 
Of books upon the subject there have been 
none save a few costly publications such as 
Vincent Robinson's " Eastern Carpets" ; and 
the sumptuous " Teppicherzeugung im Orient " 
issued in 1892 by the Imperial and Royal 
Austrian Commercial Museum, Vienna, com- 
prising five " elephant " folio volumes of litho- 
graphic illustrations of some of the rarest and 
most beautiful rugs and carpets owned by 
European collectors and by the Museum. 
Copies of these books are seldom to be found 
even upon the shelves of the great libraries. 
Instead of serving the purpose for which they

were intended they have been bought for the 
most part by mercantile houses who have uti- 
lized the designs for reproduction in modern 
fabrics. 

Mr. John Kimberly Mumford's recent book 
on " Oriental Rugs " finds, therefore, practic- 
ally a vacant field, and will be welcomed by 
all who are interested in the topic of which it 
treats. The author has performed his task 
with intelligence and painstaking thoroughness, 
and has accomplished the rare feat of writing 
an entertaining book on a technical subject.

weaving, the designs, and the classifications 
by localities and kinds, are severally dealt 
with in detail and the essential facts set forth 
in a manner which is a model of clearness. 
As an example of Mr. Mumford's style, and 
for its own sake as a graphic presentation of 
the picturesqueness of life in the East, his 
remarks about the dyers are worthy of being 
quoted at some length. He says : 

" This preeminence in dye-working carries with it, 
in Oriental countries, a dignity almost akin to that of 
priesthood. As a tree is known by its fruits, the dyer 
has place among his fellows by his hues. In proportion 
as the color he excels in is valued in popular judgment, 
the dye-master is honored in his town; and even if 
there were a lotion which could obliterate from dress 
and cuticle the traces of his trade, he would scorn to 
use it. His color is the badge of his ancient and hon- 
orable calling, dear to him as the insignia of rank to the 
soldier, or churchly black to the ecclesiastic. He glories 
in being bedaubed, and the shades of his particular 
color, upon hands, feet, and raiment, are earnest of his 
skill. He is a walking sampler of bis dyes; the proofs 
of his proficiency are upon him. 

" Traversing a village street in the East, you are 
aware of the dyer from afar off. Red, green, or purple 
from head to heels, he challenges sight when he is yet 
half a mile distant. There is the pride of a sultan in 
his carriage, and in his soul, it is plain, a chromatic 
joy which religion cannot give. He is a fine bit of 
color against the tame background of the town. In 
baggy knee-nethers and white camisole, his head all 
swaddled in a mighty turban, and his fat leathern 
pouch for pipe, tobacco, knife, money, and trinkets, 
belted about his middle, he is a type. But add to all 
these his dye, which in many values of the same color 
illumines him, from the crown of his turbaned head to 
the tips of his bare toes, he is a radiant being such as 
Occidental civilization has not known, save upon circus 
days. 

" The mind of this worthy is pervaded by a profound 
and, in a way, justifiable belief that he is the saving 
clause of the whole carpet industry. The mainspring 
of his life is the conviction that he really lends to the 
fabrics of his bailiwick, and of his native land, for that 
matter, all they possess of high aesthetic value. In his 
own view, he is the uplif ter of an otherwise slavish and 
mechanical craft. Through him weaving becomes an 
art, and all the processes from first to last, are merely

incidental to the main affair his coloring of the yarns. 
So he dips and struts his complacent life away, and to 
be an al boyaji a dyer of reds is to be one beloved 
of the Prophet." 

" Color," as Mr. Mumford happily phrases 
it, u is the Orient's secret and its glory." This, 
if not the whole truth, is at least true of that 
part of the Orient where the rug-makers live. 
It is a singular fact that retrogression in per- 
ception of color harmony should be the con- 
comitant of advancement in the scale of civili- 
zation. Yet the works of primitive peoples 
are almost without exception distinguished by 
excellence of coloring ; while among civilized 
peoples the power of producing color combina- 
tions of the highest order is one of the rarest 
of gifts. To a considerable extent the superi- 
ority in this regard of the products of barbaric 
or semi-civilized peoples is due to simpler and 
more artistic methods. As scientific knowledge 
increases, these methods are gradually sup- 
planted by others which lower the cost of pro- 
duction but also cheapen the product and 
substitute mechanical effects for the more 
artistic results of individual handiwork with 
its freedom of selection and variation. Though 
the mechanism of modern printing presses and 
looms is indeed marvellous, the most beautiful 
color-printing the world has yet seen was done 
by Japanese artizans by simply laying sheets 
of paper face downward upon engraved blocks 
inked with a brush, and pressing them by rub- 
bing with a pad held in the hand ; and some 
of the loveliest fabrics ever produced were 
wrought by Oriental weavers upon looms con- 
sisting of little more than two upright beams, 
" mere trunks of trees roughly trimmed, 
with the shanks of the lopped-off branches left 
to support the rollers." The past tense is used 
advisedly in this connection, for though the 
rug industry, under the stimulus of foreign 
orders, flourishes as never before, and the rug- 
weaving peoples imbued with the inertia of the 
Orient, continue to live as lived their fore- 
fathers before them for many generations, 
nevertheless they have succumbed to the in- 
roads of modern commercialism and have fallen 
victims to the seductive cheapness of analine 
dyes. Fortunately, however, there is at least 
a chance of stemming the tide before it is too 
late. In some of the rug-weaving districts 
there appears to be a growing appreciation, 
which it is to be hoped may continue and in- 
crease, that the adoption of European designs 
and the use of foreign dyes is a fatal error; 
though it must be admitted that so far the at- 



tempts on the part of the Persian and Turkish 
governments to repel the invasion have not 
met with unqualified success. Here at least is 
a real instance of the banal influence of the 
" money power." 

The illustrations in Mr. Mumford's book 
are altogether admirable. The only cause for 
regret is that they could not have been extended 
to include reproductions of all, or nearly all, 
of the typical patterns in use, even though it 
were necessary to resort to a cheaper and less 
satisfactory process for the additional cuts. 
This would have made the book of greater 
value to students. There are sixteen color 
plates by the new photochrome process, which 
reproduce in a really marvelous manner the 
color, texture, and quality of the old rugs se- 
lected for illustration. Other plates in mono- 
chrome reproduce typical rug designs, and 
there are several interesting half-tone plates 
from photographs taken by the author showing 
scenes in the rug-making districts.

LITERATURE IN INDIANA.* 

Indiana is a State about which it is possible 
to hold very divergent opinions. In the matter 
of general literary standing, it has, among its 
sister States, certainly no enviable reputation ; 
within its own borders, the rather resentful 
attitude toward the foreign opinion emphasizes 
unduly the importance of what the State has 
actually achieved. As might be guessed, 
neither opinion is exactly right : Indiana de- 
serves more credit than she has been given by 
outsiders ; and it will be some time before her 
merits will justify her own present estimate. 
This sort of comment might be made of any 
State that has literary aspirations ; but because 
the very fact that Indiana has literary aspira- 
tions seems droll to the outside world, the com- 
ment or truism is especially in point. Nettled 
by the persistent charge of illiteracy, and hav- 
ing anyway a real liking for literary things, 
the Indianian (Hoosier he calls himself, but 
does not like others to call him so) has set 
himself to the cultivation of literature, and has, 
despite sneers and sarcasms, accomplished 
things that are distinctly worth while. Of

what the State has done in print, Indiana has 
most emphatically no cause to be ashamed. 
She does, indeed, estimate this production far 
too charitably, but she will arrive at a critical 
apprehension of her actual literary value, 
probably, before the scoffers have done 
with their uncritical scoffing. In the mean- 
time, the two books before us, Mr. Nicholson's 
study of letters in Indiana and Mr. Parker's 
selections from Indiana poets, will do a good 
deal toward tempering the extreme views re- 
ferred to. 

Mr. Nicholson's book is a self -restrained, 
conscientious effort to set forth the facts in the 
case. The writer traces the growth of the in- 
tellectual life within the State, from its terri- 
torial beginnings to the present day ; the 
varying make-up of its population ; the indi- 
vidual marks of its most characteristic institu- 
tions and towns : in short, he soberly essays a 
chapter in American cultur-geschichte, dealing 
with the State whose life he knows from within. 
The result is an excellent piece of work. The 
chapter on New Harmony (that most interesting 
and charming of Indiana towns), narrating 
at length the fortunes of a community that 
from the early Bappite days has always kept 
its face toward the light, must have more 
than local interest. The brief essays, in part 
biographical, in part critical, on Eggleston, 
Wallace, Riley, Thompson, and others, send 
one with an awakened interest to the pages of 
the other volume under review. And yet it 
must be said of Mr. Nicholson's book, that it 
does not prove its case. It shows beyond cavil 
that things intellectual happen in Indiana as 
well as elsewhere ; but when all is said, it leaves 
the reader with the feeling that something he 
did not know much about has been made clear, 
rather than that here is something new and 
preeminently worth knowing. 

The second book, the volume of selections, 
has been well managed by its editors. Their 
aim was to show fairly what Indiana has done 
in poetry in a century. No fewer than one 
hundred and forty-six names are on the list of 
writers. A book of one-tenth as many poets, 
with ten times as much from each one as is 
here allowed, would have been a book of far 
better literary quality, but it would have been 
correspondingly less representative. One turns 
the pages respectfully. Here is no revelation 
of new poetic power, but many a verse that 
one is glad to read, and many more that will 
not attract a second time. The best things 
are already well-known ; the hitherto unknown 



rarely have the unmistakable note of passion 
or of charm. But if they fail to make the 
final appeal, they nevertheless are, as a rule, 
dignified and sincere. They show that Indiana 
has an absolute craving to express itself in lit- 
erary form, and this means that the State has 
encouraged, and will encourage, literature. 
But there is too much rushing into print. The 
craving to express oneself is not the same as 
the need to express oneself, and this means 
that much of the Indiana poetry is uncon- 
sciously imitative, and therefore expresses no 
genuine message. That in the three hundred 
or more poems which make up the volume 
there should be so comparatively little that is 
futile speaks highly for the good taste of Mr. 
Parker and his associate. 

Indiana's real contribution to literature is 
Mr. Riley, a true poet, if I may arrogate 
the right to judge. Of the rest of the choir, 
one notes here and there a genuinely poetic 
voice : of the men, Maurice Thompson, whose 
lamented death has been but recently an- 
nounced ; of the women, Miss Evaleen Stein ; 
perhaps half a dozen besides. The many others 
who sing have their reward in singing, and in 
knowing that they have greatly helped to clear 
their commonwealth of an oft-repeated charge. 
The " Hoosier literary zeal " is an honest im- 
pulse that no American State may live without.

NOVEL, VIEWS OF NERVOUS FUNCTIONS.* 



Professor Loeb's manual to which he gives 
the title, " Comparative Physiology of the Brain 
and Comparative Psychology," is not at all a 
compendium devoUed to a survey of accepted 
facts and principles in regard to the way in 
which the nervous system performs its func- 
tions, but is an original contribution to the 
fundamental conceptions of what a nervous 
system is and does. 

The work is indeed radical in its tendencies 
and calls into question certain generally ac- 
cepted and basal notions. An elaborate and 
ingenious series of experiments upon the lower 
forms of animal life leads the author to the 
conclusion that the responses which these or- 
ganisms make are essentially physico-chemical 
in their nature ; " life-phenomena are deter-

mined by physical and chemical conditions 
which are outside the realm of histology." In 
accordance with this view, the function of the 
central nervous system is considerably lowered ; 
instead of the currently accepted conception 
of a centralizing and coordinating power, it is 
maintained that " the central nervous system 
does not control response to stimulation "; 
" the assumption of special centres of coordi- 
nation is superfluous "; the nervous system 
simply acts as a more speedy means of con- 
ducting the impressions, and the nervous sys- 
tem consists of a series of segmental reflexes 
each capable of going through a certain me- 
chanical activity. The essential intellectual 
function is associative memory, and it is in the 
complexity and variety of development of this 
function that comparative psychology finds its 
problems. 

" Accordingly we do not raise and discuss the ques- 
tion as to whether or not animals possess intelligence, 
but we consider it our aim to work out the dynamics 
of the processes of association, and find out the physical 
or chemical conditions which determine the variations 
in the capacity of memory in the various organisms." 

The views thus set forth by Professor Loeb 
are far-reaching in their consequences and 
seem certain to play an important role in 
biological controversy for the immediate 
future. They particularly antagonize the doc- 
trines of the localization of functions in the 
brain, and for the moment seem to favor the 
position of the uniform value of brain areas, 
a doctrine in vogue before the "localizationists" 
came forward with their brilliant experiments. 
It may be, however, that a reinterpretation of 
these experiments, and a bringing into harmony 
of many puzzling exceptions, may result from 
the changed mode of approach to these prob- 
lems advocated by Professor Loeb. 

In the discussion of the* inheritance of ac- 
quired characteristics (and the mechanism of 
all heredity, according to Loeb, must be found 
again in chemical qualities) we have an ex- 
ample of how quickly a view that at first sight 
seems to run counter to current facts and beliefs 
soon comes into good standing and gathers to 
its support an astonishing array of apparently 
unobserved facts. Possibly the same fate 
awaits these well-stated and clearly developed 
views ; and no student of this most interesting 
phase of the problems of life can afford to re- 
main in ignorance of the wide range of facts, 
and the suggestive series of interpretations 
which Professor Loeb has brought together in 
this volume. JOSEPH JASTROW. 



RECENT POETRY.* 

The perfect typography of the Merrymount 
Press, which fittingly enshrines Mr. Arthur Sher- 
burne Hardy's " Songs of Two," is not more ex- 
quisite than the verses themselves, with their 
unfailing grace and their crystalline purity of dic- 
tion. Mr. Hardy is an infrequent seeker of print, 
for he has the artistic conscience as few possess it, 
and we know that when his name 'does adorn a 
title-page, what follows will be noteworthy. This 
sheaf of a score of lyrics, accompanied by a dozen 
miscellaneous pieces, embodies an utterance of the 
rarest grace and the most absolute sincerity. Here 
is one of the score of " Songs of Two." 

"We thought when Love at last should come, 

The rose would lose its thorn, 
And every lip but Joy's be dumb 

When Love, sweet Love, was born ; 
That never tears should start to rise, 

No night o'ertake our morn, 
Nor any guest of grief surprise, 

When Love, sweet Love, was born. 

" And when he came, O Heart of mine ! 

And stood within our door, 
No joy our dreaming could divine 

Was missing from his store. 
The thorns shall wound our hearts again, 

But not the fear of yore, 
For all the guests of grief and pain 

Shall serve him evermore."

Among Mr. Hardy's miscellaneous pieces, the verses 
called " Iter Supremum " seem to stand out above 
the rest by force of their sheer imaginative vision 
and their grave beauty. 

"Oh, what a night for a soul to go I 
The wind a hawk, and the fields in snow ; 
No screening cover of leaves in the wood, 
Nor a star abroad the way to show. 

" Do they part in peace, soul with its clay ? 
Tenant and landlord, what do they say ? 
Was it sigh of sorrow or of release 
I heard just now as the face turned gray ? 

"What if, aghast on the shoreless main 
Of Eternity, it sought again 
The shelter and rest of the Isle of Time, 
And knocked at the door of its house of pain ! 

"On the tavern hearth the embers glow. 
The laugh is deep and the flagons low, 
But without, the wind and the trackless sky 
And night at the gates where a soul would go ! " 

The sonnets of Mr. Lloyd Mifflin exhibit a con- 
siderable degree of mastery over the mechanics of 
their verse-form, and usually have enough of sub- 
stantial thought and imagination to make them ac- 
ceptable. The collection entitled " The Fields of 
Dawn and Later Sonnets " includes an even hun- 
dred pieces, which are characterized by even excel- 
lence. Since there is little choice among them, we 
select, almost at random, the following : 

"There is a legend the Algonqnins tell 

Of power and splendor of the Great White One ; 
The God of Light he is, and of the Sun, 
And in their strange lore hath no parallel. 

He, in the Summer, from his citadel. 
Comes to the gates of his dominion, 
And throws them open when the day 's begun, 
And shuts them in the evening. But a spell 

Saps his puissance when the Autumn haze 
Spreads its dim-shimmering silver on the rills ; 
Then to the mountain-tops he slowly wends 

And, idly drowsing on the dreamy hills, 
Puffs at his pipe, and as the smoke descends. 
Behold our mellow Indian Summer days ! " 

The sequence of nearly fifty sonnets from which 
this is taken sings very effectively of the procession 
of the seasons in Southern Pennsylvania, as reflected 
in the youthful consciousness of the poet during a 
single year. 

The modest collection of verses written during 
the past ten or twelve years by President David 
Starr Jordan shows that the more tender and fan- 
ciful sides of a man's nature need undergo no 
atrophy from the most strenuous pursuit of severe 
intellectual ideals. These verses reveal an aspect 
of their author that may be strange to those who 
think of him in his public character who think 
of him as the energetic educational administrator, 
the strong toiler in the difficult fields of science, 
the uncompromising upholder of the principles of 
political morality but they are no surprise to his 
friends, and it is to his friends that they are ad- 
dressed. The opening lines " To Barbara " are too 
intimate for discussion, and in view of the writer's 
recent bereavement, too sacred for anything more 



explicit than this veiled comment. Let us quote 
rather from the graceful song of " Vive'rols." 

" Beyond the sea, I know not where, 

There is a town called Vive'rols ; 
I know not if 't is near or far, 
I know not what its features are, 

I only know 't is Vive'rols. 

"I only know, should thou and I 

Through its old walls of crumbling stone 

Together wander all alone, 
No spot on earth conld be more fair 

Than ivy-covered Vive'rols ! 
No grass be greener anywhere, 
No blner sky nor softer air 

Than we should find in Vive'rols. 

"Love, we may wander far or near, 
The sun shines bright o'er Vive'rols ; 

Green is the grass, the skies are clear. 

No clouds obscure our pathway, dear ; 
Where love is, there is Vive'rola, 
There is no other Vive'rols." 

Thus Dr. Jordan strikes the note of sentiment ; 
but a deeper note is struck when his mind contem- 
plates the grave problems of man's destiny. 

"When man shall come to manhood's destiny, 

When our slow-toddling race shall be full grown, 
Deep in each human heart a chamber lone 

Of Holies Holiest shall builded be ; 

And each man for himself shall hold the key. 
Each there must kindle his own altar fires, 
Each burn an offering of his own desires, 

And each at last his own High Priest must be." 

Here is the expression of a faith that can contem- 
plate undismayed the breaking down of beliefs that 
have had their day, and can find a firm refuge in 
ideals far nobler than were ever revealed to souls 
in the bondage of superstition. 

Another little book of verse from the far West 
the work of one of Dr. Jordan's associates is 
taken up with the same deep matters, but reveals a 
mind still restless from the onslaughts of science 
upon superstition, and uncertain concerning the 
ultimate goodness of the soul of things. 

"Says Science : ' Lo, I lift the veil. Behold ! ' 

But when we turn, with eyes that almost fail, 
Before the Face in darkness from of old 
Shrouded, there hangs a yet unlif ted veil." 

Thus discourses Mr. William Henry Hudson in 
" The Sphinx and Other Poems." He has no clear 
vision of what may be beyond that other unlifted 
veil. But what the intelligence fails to discern 
seems sometimes to be foreshadowed in dreams. 
"Was it a dream ? I know not. This I know 
The memory of that evening long ago, 
Though oftentimes I yet have sought in vain 
To catch that wind-borne melody again, 
Has linger'd in my life, a sacred part 
Of all my deepest being ; for to me. 
With some strange hint of some strange mystery, 

That murmur brought a solace for the heart, 
An inward sense that everything was well, 
A touch of peace, of which no words can tell ! '' 

But the old doubt recurs, and the waking hour dis- 
credits the vision seen in sleep. The author's mood 
is that of the " Pathetic " symphony of Tschai- 



142 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



kowsky ; it is the mood of Arnold rather than that 
of Tennyson. Let us once more contrast it with 
that of Dr. Jordan, as expressed in " The Bubbles 
of Saki." 

" I do rejoice that when ' of me and thee ' 

Men talk no longer, yet not less but more 
The Eternal Saki still that bowl shall fill, 
And ever stronger, fairer bubbles pour. 

" A humble note in the Eternal Song, 

The Perfect Singer hath made place for me, 
And not one atom in Earth's wondrous throng 
But shall be needful to Infinity." 

This is the effective major resolution of the minor 
harmonies of the other poet. 

Mr. Charles Keeler's " Idyls of El Dorado " are 
Californian lays and legends, picturesque in their 
portrayal of the Pacific coast in its physical aspects, 
and reflecting the free expansive spirit of its in- 
habitants. As a bit of local coloring, these Mon- 
terey stanzas are effective : 

" The sea throbs faintly at my feet, 
Amid the rocks it swashes low, 
In pale green sweeps 
And purple deeps 
It undulates with tireless beat, 
It pulses in unending flow. 

" All green and brown the seaweed clings 
To pallid rocks, wave-worn and grim ; 
The mountains rise 
To misty skies, 

The wind amid the cypress sings 
And sea-birds wander dark and dim." 

But the writer is not content with the natural 
beauty of the land which is his home, and his vision 
foresees the added beauty of art in some future day. 

"Beauty shall here hold court upon the heights 

And men shall fashion temples for her shrine, 
With chantings high of praise and starward flights 
Of silver chords and organ's throb divine. 

"The sculptor here shall hew the formless stone 

To shapes of beauty dreamed on cloud-throned crest, 
The painter shall reveal what he alone 
Saw as he brooded on th' earth-mother's breast." 

All this may well be. Meanwhile, we note with 
more satisfaction than all this prophecy the fact 
that the writer's voice is raised in indignant protest 
against the madness, springing from the lust of 
foreign conquest, that has of late made a mock of 
all our political ideals, and that has infected the 
Pacific Coast more fatally than any other section 
of the country. It is from Alaska that a text is 
taken for the following fine stanza : 
" We who have failed to rule a wilderness 

Now preach of liberty in tropic seas ; 
Forsooth our sway the Orient hordes shall bless 

While politicians trim to every breeze, 

Ood, must our dear sons be slain, such men to please ? " 

Still another Californian volume is Mr. Howard 
V. Sutherland's " Jacinta." It is a very small 
volume, and the narrative poem which serves it for 
a title makes up the greater part of the contents. 
A simplicity and a sentimentality that seem to be 
alike affected are the characteristics of this versified 
tale. Instead of quoting from it, we prefer to 



select one of Mr. Sutherland's miscellaneous pieces, 
and it shall be this " Prayer for a Man's Passing." 
" Let me not pass till eve, 

Till that day's fight is done ; 
What soldier cares to leave 

The field until it's won ! 
And I have loved my work and fain 
Would be deemed worthy of the ranks again. 

" Let twilight come, then night, 

And when the first birds sing 
Their matin songs, and light 

Wakens each slumbering thing, 
Let Someone waken me, and set 
My feet to steps that lead me upward yet." 

Mr. Frederic Crowninshield has written a cen- 
tury of sonnets, and appended to them a few short 
pieces in other lyrical forms, all for the purpose 
of illustrating the thesis that painters have emotions 
peculiar to their own special art, and that they 
alone can give them adequate verbal expression. 
" Pictoris Carmina " is the title of this volume of 
verse, which does not mean that all of its contents 
are poems for pictures, although a series of eight 
illustrations to some extent bear out this suggestion. 
These poems exhibit refinement and the culture 
that comes from wide reading and journeying; 
they also display considerable technical ability. 
That they are far from faultless in this respect 
may be illustrated by such a line as the second of 
these two : 

" We of the East, who you but y ester bore, 
Were aliens, and variations racial show." 
Another illustration is this opening of the sonnet 
u To Science ": 

" In the world's race, Science, you sore strain 
Our credence with the miracles that bring 
Great gain perchance not bliss." 

Mr. Crowninshield's diction is not essentially poet- 
ical, and it is the thinker rather than the singer 
whose voice speaks from these pages. There are 
too many words not yet mellowed to poetic uses, 
too many startling and cacophonous collocations, 
and the poet's hand is clearly not subdued to the 
material in which it works. Yet there are frequent 
phrases that arrest the attention by their vivid 
presentation of truth, and a certain not easily de- 
finable pleasure may be derived from these stiff- 
jointed measures. To exhibit the writer at his 
best, we will select the sonnet called " Decadence." 

" When fields are green with aftermath of Fall, 
When trees parade in rich vermillioned dress, 
Wan exhalations from the vales possess 
The full, ripe forms of Earth, and cast a pall 

Impalliding o'er mellowed hues. Withal 

Not charmless but the charm that doth impress 
Pale fever on some deep-eyed shepherdess 
Near Rome, who croons her morbid madrigal. 

Yet when the waxing sun with lusty rays 
Burns into nothingness the vapors white, 
And bares the splendid view of mount and lea, 

Then gladsome Nature chants his ringing praise. 
0, Life, consume the pale malarious blight 
That hangs o'er Art, and give us Sanity ! " 

" Withal not charmless " this is the final verdict 
upon Mr. Crowninshield's labored but interesting

The poems of Mr. Samuel Valentine Cole open 
with a group of pieces inspired by classical asso- 
ciations, with a tribute to Lucretius, whose 
" Voice goes singing through the world, 
And in it the troth-seeking soul of man," 

a tribute to Virgil, who 

" In the interval between 
Great Homer and the glorious Florentine, 
Builded his dream of mingled fate and faith. 
Now swaying toward the dreary pagan doubt, 
Now, by prophetic vision a mere chance, 
Toward the dear Hope so soon to light the world." 

These poems suggest the Tennysonian manner, and 
suggestion becomes somewhat too obviously imita- 
tion in the poems that follow. In The Song of 
Silenus," for example, we read that 

"So he sang till on the water melted evening's golden bar, 
Till the fire died on the hilltops, sang until the evening star, 

Till we saw the silent Archer climb his zenith-winding stair, 
And across the northern heavens stream the dark Egypt- 
ian's hair." 

And in " The Bees of Aristaeus " we find such evi- 
dent Locksleyisms as these : 

" Summers of the stormlesa heaven, summers of the windless 

sea, 
Linked together by as little of the winter as could be ; 

"Fountains singing in the covert or asleep like liquid glass, 
And no poison in the flowers, and no serpent in the grass ; 

" Meads of unlaborious tillage, seas without the toiling oars ; 
Magic ships of cloud and sunshine dropped all treasures on 
all shores ; 

" And no iron-handed terror smiting at the hearts of men ; 
Justice blindfold ruled the people, War lay chained within 
his den." 

Mr. Cole's verse discourses of many themes, bat 
the Tennysonian strain is ever recurrent, and the 
classical interest reappears on almost every other 
page. The verse is always pleasing, smooth-flowing 
in its movement, and kindled with the fire of the 
idealism that never becomes outworn. 

The " Poems " of Mr. Alexander Blair Thaw are 
admirable in technique and sincere in feeling. 
They are abstract rather than picturesque, and their 
imaginative quality is of the conventional sort. 
This sonnet to the Venus of Melos is a characteristic 
example : 

" We dare not hope to reach thy lofty place, 
Nor with dark Fate to be quite reconciled. 
Thy seeming sightless eyes, benignly mild 
As of the early gods, or of some race 
Of men almost divine, look into space 
Beyond our mortal vision ; with no wild 
Swift passion torn, so hast thon ever smiled 
Great love immortal lighting thy calm face. 

" Born of the womb of earth, who doth beguile 
Both gods and man to woo her, for all time 
Thou art a thing of worship. Ah, sublime 
Mother of men ! We may not reconcile 
The darkness with the dreaming ; yet still we climb 
The starlit heights to win thy sacred smile." 

The author of " The Lute and Lays," in the 
opening poem of his volume, thus discourses of the 
themes he has sought to set to music : 



" I sing of beauty as the birds 
Awake in gladness and rejoice 
That God hath given each a voice 
To sing their joy, though not in words. 

' ' I sing a heart-felt happiness 

The glad contentment of the soul 
When joy breaks forth beyond control 
And utters more than words express. 

" How shall I then my gladness hide, 
As down the drift of life I roam ? 
All nature is my boundless home, 
And love my only perfect guide. 

" For in love's light my song takes wing ; 
Her star pervades my universe, 
And all my rhapsodies are hers 
It is her beauty that I sing." 

Mr. Welles fills something like a hundred pages 
with pleasant little verses of this simple type. They 
are full of tender sentiment, but exhibit little 
variety, and call for no detailed comment. 

The "Lyrical Vignettes" of Mr. F. V. N. 
Fainter are simple studies in verse, no one of them 
overrunning a single page, and indicative of a very 
modest ambition. 

' ' I would with Wordsworth sing in humble lays, 

But true in every tone, 
The simple joys and woes that fill our days 
With merriment or moan." 

This is the sort of thing that Mr. Painter gives as, 
commendable in sentiment and commonplace in 
expression . 

More than once, in his volume entitled " On Life's 
Stairway," Mr. Frederic Lawrence Knowles exhorts 
his fellow-poets to rise to the height of their great 
calling. 

"Unravel all your tangled cheats. 
Your triple-twisted thread conceits, 
Your subtle sonnets fling afar ! 
Stand up and show what man you are ! 

"O juggler with the fire divine, 
O hoarder of God's bread and wine, 
Your dark and doleful sprigs of verse 
Nod like the plumes above a hearse. 

" We want again the note of joy, 
The immortal rapture of the boy, 
The flame lit quenchless in the dust, 
The lips that sing because they must." 

But in spite of such brave words as these, Mr. 
Knowles has contented himself with the " sprigs of 
verse," very pretty sprigs sometimes, as in his 
" Secrets." 

"O Rose, climb up to her window 

And in through the casement reach, 
And say what I may not utter, 
In your beautiful silent speech ! 

"She will shake the dew from your petals, 

She will press you close to her lips, 
She will hold you never so lightly 
In her warm white finger-tips. 

" And then who can tell ? She may whisper 

(While the city dreams below), 
' I was dreaming of him when you woke me, 
But, rose, he must never know.' " 

Miss Josephine Preston Peabody is one of the 
most promising of our younger group of poets, but

THE DIAL, 



we cannot say that her second volume quite renews 
for us the pleasure given by " The Wayfarers." 
The new collection includes one long piece an 
Elizabethan play and a number of essentially 
lyrical compositions. Of the play, in which W. S. 
himself has a part, we must say that it is ingenious 
but not convincing. The other pieces suffer from 
too much of what may be called pale abstraction. 
They are best when they are most simple, as in these 
stanzas : 

"Now the roads, hushed with dark, 

Lead the homeward way, 
I will rest, I will hark 

What the weeds can say ; 
Wondering in the afterglow, 

Heart's-ease of the day. 

"One day more, one day more. 

Ay, if it were new ! 
There the city smoke goes soft, 

Melting in the blue ; 
And the highways, vext with dust, 

Heal them in the dew." 

Mrs. Dorr's " Afterglow," in which her later 
poems have been collected, is serene with the soft 
radiance of the just accomplished twilight. The 
writer has been a graceful and melodious singer 
through all her years, and her song is still sweet 
and sincere. We may quote the following sonnet 
as expressive of the spirit that breathes through 
these chastened pages. 

" Whom the Gods love die old ! Oh life, dear life, 
Let the old sing thy praises, for they know 
How year by year the summers come and go, 

Each with its own abounding sweetness rife ! 

They know, though frosts be cruel as the knife, 
Yet with each June the perfect rose shall blow, 
And daisies blossom and the green grass row, 

Triumphant still, unvexecl by storm or strife. 

They know that night more splendid is than day ; 
That sunset skies flame in the gathering dark, 
And the deep waters change to molten gold ; 

They know that Autumn richer is than May ; 

They hear the night-birds singing like the lark 
Ah life, sweet life, whom the Gods love die old 1" 

The "Last Songs from Vagabondia" form the 
third booklet in the series which embodies the 
joint activity of Mr. Bliss Carman and the late 
Richard Hovey. The poems are credited to their 
respective writers, but this precaution is hardly 
necessary with two men whose lyrical styles are so 
widely diverse. There are few pieces in the book 
which a careful critic could not certainly assign to 
its proper authorship without the warrant of any 
formal indication. Richard Hovey's sonnet " From 
the Cliff " may be taken as a characteristic example 
of his work. 

" Here on this ledge, the broad plain stretched below, 
The calm hills smiling in immortal mirth, 
The blue sky whitening as it nears the earth, 

Afar where all the summits are aglow, 

I feel a mighty wind upon me blow 

Like God's breath kindling in my soul a birth 
Of turbulent music struggling to break girth, 

I pass with Dante through eternal woe, 
Quiver with Sappho's passion at my heart, 

See Pindar's chariots flashing past the goal, 



Triumph o'er splendours of unutterable light 
And know supremely this, O God, Thou art, 
Feeling in all this tumult of my soul 

Grand kinship with the glory of Thy might." 

One could not find a better description of Richard 
Hovey's talent than the very phrase which speak a 
of " turbulent music struggling to break girth." 
His verse always seems to chafe against the limita- 
tions of form, and he recks little for such minor 
verbal infelicities as the use of " grand " in the 
closing line. On the other hand, the more surely 
artistic instinct of Mr. Carman makes the author- 
ship of such a piece as " Marigolds " absolutely un- 
mistakable. 

"The marigolds are nodding ; 
I wonder what they know. 
Go. listen very gently ; 
You may persuade them so. 

"Go, be their little brother 
As humble as the grass, 
And lean upon the hill- wind. 
And watch the shadows pass. 

"Put off the pride of knowledge, 

Put by the fear of pain ; 

You may be counted worthy 

To live with them again. 

"Be Darwin in your patience, 
Be Chaucer in your love ; 
They may relent and tell you 
What they are thinking of." 

Even when the note becomes grotesque or didactic, 
departing widely from the ordinary lyrical gamut, 
the distinctive qualities of the two poets are none 
the less apparent. He would be a dull observer 
who would not be sure to whom to attribute " The 
Sceptics." 

" It was the little leaves beside the road. 

" Said Grass, ' What is that sound 
So dismally profound, 

That detonates and desolates the air ? ' 
' That is St. Peter's bell,' 
Said rain-wise Pimpirnel ; 
' He is music to the godly, 
Though to us he sounds so oddly, 
And he terrifies the faithful unto prayer.' 

"Then something very like a groan 
Escaped the naughty little leaves. 

"Said Grass, 'And whither track 
These creatures all in black, 

So woebegone and penitent and meek ? ' 
' They 're mortals bound for church,' 
Said the little Silver Birch ; 
' They hope to get to heaven 
And have their sins forgiven, 
If they talk to God about it once a week.' 

" And something very like a smile 
Ran through the naughty little leaves. 

"Said Grass, 4 What is that noise 
That startles and destroys 

Our blessed summer brooding when we 're tired ? ' 
' That 's folk a-praising God,' 
Said the tough old cynic Clod ; 
' They do it every Sunday, 
They '11 be all right on Monday ; 

It 's just a little habit they 've acquired.' 

" And laughter spread among the little leaves."

And the reader would be no less doll who should 
hesitate for a moment abont the proper ascription 
of the following sonnet. 

" Our Gothic minds have gargoyle fancies. Odd, 
That there will come a day when yon and 1 
Shall not be yon and I, that we shall lie 
We two, in the damp earth-mould, above each clod 
A drunken headstone in the neglected sod. 
Thereon the phrase, Hie Jacet, worn awry 
And then our virtues, bah ! and piety, 
Perhaps some cheeky reference to God[! 

And haply after many a century, 
Some spectacled old man shall drive the birds 
A moment from their song in the lonely spot 
And make a copy of the quaint old words 

They will then be quaint and old and all for what ? 
To fill a gap in a genealogy." 

Mr. John Stuart Thomson belongs to the group 
of young Canadian singers who have contributed 
so largely to American literature during the past 
score of years, and who have helped to bring into 
our poetry that penetrative interpretation of natural 
beauty which is one of the most marked character- 
istics of American song. Reviewing an earlier 
volume by Mr. Thomson, we said : " It is remark- 
able how close to the heart of nature these young 
Canadian poets contrive to keep. They have the 
faculty of observation minute, accurate, and at 
the same time sympathetic in a degree quite ex- 
traordinary even to-day, and almost unknown in 
English poetry before Tennyson opened our eyes." 
Recalling this half-forgotten comment, we wish to 
supplement it by noting in " A Day's Song," Mr. 
Thomson's new volume, something of the quality 
of rich sensuousness of which Keats had so imperial 
a mastery. Our warrant for this saying shall be 
an extract from the ode which Mr. Thomson, 
greatly daring, has dedicated to Autumn." 

" Now dreams fall in the valleys of the night ; 

The last red poppy stills its ardent breast ; 

No more the morning, with a hand of light, 
Will wake its petals from their dreamy rest ; 

Sighs from each breeze the sad, sweet slumber song ; 

Sleep, like the dew, falls from the Evening's wings, 
And every Beauty veils its eyes in tears ; 

What woes to thee belong, 
Most mournful time, that not a robin sings, 

To melt thy heart shut up in friendless fears. 

" Departing glory leaves the world forlorn ; 

E'en as the moon, above the Delian shrine 

Forsaken, through these barren fields of corn 
A pallid light, a sorrow half divine, 

Falls on the silent moody wilderness ; 

No harvest bells, laughter of lovers young. 
No music of the ringing scythe, is heard ; 

Almost a god's distress 
Hangs o'er these valleys, where of eld was sung 

The fluted joyance of a summer's bird." 

The glorious poem from which these two stanzas 
are taken would adorn the coronal of a singer of 
high renown; it offers renewed evidence of the 
truth expressed by him who wrote, " The poetry of 
earth is never dead." 

We read "My New Curate," by the Rev. P. A. 
Sheehan, a few months ago with so much quiet 
satisfaction that the name of the writer became at 



once a passport to favorable consideration for 
whatever else he might publish, and when a volume 
of verse of the same authorship appeared not long 
since, we anticipated from its reading a genuine 
pleasure. That anticipation has not been disap- 
pointed, for " Cithara Mea " is a collection of pieces 
that stir the deepest emotions, and appeal to the 
most spiritual part of our being. Technically, they 
are very faulty, but they contain so much of the 
substance of true poetry, that we may well pardon 
the occasional redundancies and cacophonies. As 
befits the writer's calling, these poems are mainly 
religious in their inspiration, and the note is boldly 
sounded in " The Hidden " and " The Revealed," 
the two pieces which open the volume. Those 
moods of rapture and mystical exaltation which are 
the very essence of religion are not often imparted 
to readers as this verse succeeds in imparting them, 
and the spirituality of the utterance is no more 
striking than ia the imaginative splendor of the 
diction when at its best. 

" God's vesture curves and floats around His throne, 
As float ensanguined clouds at eventide ; 
His Heaven is thickly peopled ; yet alone 
In their majestic solitude abide 

" The Holy Ones. No angel wing hath swept 
The golden dust of all the centuries, 
Or tears the lonely JEons have bewept, 
And sunk into the silence of eternities, 

" There where His footstool stretches thro' the cloud ; 
Yet, the vast silences of God are stirred 
By all the pauseless waves that cry aloud 
In anthems that afar are feebly heard, 

" Although the orbed heaven reels and quakes 
Under the thunders that are ever rolled 
From shrill-voiced spirits o'er the quivering lakes 
Of spaces populous, or of worlds nnsonled." 

More than once, in reading these companion poems 
of doubt and faith in alternation, we have been re- 
minded of the great central poem of the century 
upon this subject the supreme expression of 
Tennyson's genius. Father Sheehan's blank verse 
is sometimes very fine indeed, as in his story of 
" Sentan the Culdee," the monk who dallied with 
the imaginings of heathen philosophers until his 
faith was on the point of losing its moorings. He 
is ordered, for the saving of his soul, to become a 
hermit, and these are the words of the Abbot who 
pronounces the decree of exile : 

41 Thy bed the heather, salted by sea- winds ; 
Thy books the open manuscripts of God ; 
Thy food whate'er the sea- fowl bring to thee. 
Once and again, thou mayst near approach 
The cells, where dwell the brethren of Ardmor, 
To shrive thee, and receive the Paschal guest. 
But thou shalt shun all intercourse with men, 
And love the silent solitudes of God. 
Perchance in some far off and distant time, 
When thou, through fires of discipline and prayer, 
The dim mists cleansed from thy half-blinded eyes, 
Hast, in the sacred silence of the seas, 
Pondered the dread exorbitance of God : 
Thou mayest go forth to see the blinding face 
Of Him, to whom the stars are blackened slags. 
And angels' faces blurred and stained with sin." 



146 



THE DIAL 



[March 1, 



Such verse as this is rare enough in our modern 
time, as rare, perhaps, as the lost faith bemoaned 
by the poet, when he sings of 

" These leaden days, from which the sun 
Of God's sweet Face hath vanished into night, 
And in the depths His voice hath died away." 
Although religious inspiration gives the breath of 
life to Father Sheehan's volume, there are occasional 
pieces of lighter strain, such, for example, as the 
lyric " Cosette," with its pathetic invocation to the 
spirit of a lost child : 

" Across the gray sands of Dinan, 

Cosette ! 
Contest thou, bird of sea and song, 

Cosette ! 

Thy hair-cloud streaming far behind, 
Vexed by the teasing, amorous wind, 
Light in thy laughing eyes, and kind, 

Cosette I " 

Finally, to do anything like adequate justice to 
this volume, we must reproduce this noble sonnet 
upon the " Mer-de-Glace." 

" Hither God brought His rebel seas to try 

How high His wrath could lash them, unrelieved 

By sinking spaces or by lowering sky 
But they, by loftiest altitudes deceived, 
Leaped to his lash as if they fain believed 

They too could sweep the skies, and there decry 
His mandate when the smoking altars heaved 

And sullen waters left the hill-tops dry. 

" But He, resenting such Titanic pride, 

Transfixed them in columnar ice and stone, 

Leaving vast valleys in their solitude. 
There till the scythes of the last lava-tide 
Shall level all things, all proud things dethrone. 
The spirits of those Stylites dream and brood." 

Here is splendor of imagination and to spare. There 
is not a poet living who might not be proud to 
have written this sonnet. 

It is not often that one thin volume displays the 
versatility of Mr. C. K. Pooler's " Translations and 
Other Verses." Taking the contents in order, we 
find (1) some graceful translations from the Latin, 
ranging all the way from Catullus to Landor, (2) 
a section of pieces, mostly lyrical, in conventional 
forms, (3) a few ballads in Ulster dialect, combining 
humor with pathos, and both genuine, (4) some 
excellent fooling in the form of parodies on Brown- 
ing, Mr. Kipling, Mr. Swinburne, Morris, Burton 
(of the " Anatomy "), and Bacon (of the "Essays "), 
and (5) an appendix of neatly-turned Latin verses. 
Three of these sections we leave to be read by title, 
reserving our quotation space for a specimen each 
of the lyric and the parody. Our lyric shall be 
" The Evening Campion." 

" Thy form will lure no maiden's eye, 

White flower that flowerest free, 
Nor here will flaunt the butterfly, 

Nor hither stoop the bee, 
And faintest airs of the blue sky 

Unsweetened float by thee. 

" Yet lips unknown to morning's light 

Drink here beneath the moon ; 
Scarce mark our eyes the glimmering flight, 

Scarce heed our ears the tune 
Of softer winglets of the night 
Than any wings of noon." 



And our parody shall be an excerpt from " Saturnia 
Regna," after whom we need not specify. 

" But too long hath the gold of the merchant been locked 

from the heart of greed, 
Too long hath the harvest whitened for the hand that gave 

the seed ; 

Too long is the palace mosaic and its light of starry lamps 
Blind to the Cadger and dumb to the honest shuffle of 

Tramps, 
And the harp of the Singer of Sigurd wreathed green with 

the bay-leaves' due 

To ' After the Ball,' and ' Daisy,' and ' Linger Longer Loo,' 
But O, for the Sun that we see not, and the Moon whereof 

none knows, 
Save the Year of the Flowering Yule-tide, and the Field 

of the Thornless Rose, 
Where the Pen shall be as the Shovel, and the Night shall 

be as the Day, 
And the Greed of the Heart shall perish and its Longing 

pass away ; 
Where the lute shall be dumb and the viol, and dumb in 

the happy years 
The music cradled of sorrow, the song that blossoms for 

tears. 
Thither when comes the Spoiler, what need of a Battle 

Call, 
Where each hath less than a little, and little, belike, have 

all? 
Should he tarry for nought who hath nothing ? Nay, hard 

over holt and heath 
He will hie as the Dog to his kennel with all that is his in 

his teeth. 
So all that is ours shall be all men's the heart and the 

hand and the brain, 
When over the ghost of a nation shall the risen Balder 

reign." 

This is fooling, no doubt, but it is more than that, 
and we are glad that the socialist is met with his 
own weapons, and shown how effective they may 
prove in hostile hands.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The origin One ^ * ne ^ e8 * accoun ts of the origin 

and development and development of the alphabet is 
oj the alphabet. Mr Edward Clodd's recent contri- 
bution to the " Library of Useful Stories " (Apple- 
ton), entitled " The Story of the Alphabet." In a 
volume of two hundred pages, including ninety 
illustrations, he contrives to tell with surprising 
fullness the history of the leading alphabets of the 
world. If any justification of the book were needed, 
Mr. Clodd's, as given in his preface, would suffice : 
that it fills a gap in discussing with comparative 
fullness " those primitive stages of the art of 
writing, knowledge of which is essential for tracing 
the development of the art, so that its place in the 
general evolution of human inventions is made 
clear "; and in stating the evidence furnished by 
the discoveries of Professor Flinders Petrie in 
Egypt (a summary of which is found in the " Jour- 
nal of the Anthropological Institute," xxix. 204- 
206, 1899) and Mr. Arthur J. Evans in Crete, no 
reference to these discoveries occurring in the 1899 
reprint of Canon Taylor's book. It is interesting 
to note that whereas the first edition of Taylor

(1883) disposed of the Cretan alphabet in a foot- 
note of two lines (ii. 64), Clock! has found it neces- 
sary to devote thirty-six pages to " The Cretan 
and Allied Scripts." His able summary of Evans's 
"Cretan Pictographs and Pre-Phoanician Script" 
is one of the most interesting parts of the book. 
He draws no conclusion, but declines to accept M. 
de Rough's theory, which Taylor supports, that the 
Pboanician letters came from the Egyptian hieratic 
writing, preferring to look for a future confirma- 
tion of Evans's theory that "the rudiments of the 
Phoenician writing may after all have come in part 
at least from the ^gean side." He differs further 
from Taylor in regard to the Indo-Bactrian alpha- 
bet of the Asoka edicts, with Burnell considering 
it as of Iranian origin, whereas Taylor regards it 
as coming from the Sabean ; and he does not ac- 
cept Taylor's theory of the Greek origin of the 
runes, leaving the problem unsettled. The book is 
marked by catholicity of view and freshness of 
style. Two misprints have been noted: p. 71, 1. 13, 
read Taylor ; p. 172, 1. 13, Pelasgia. 



An English 
taiior't lively 



That a bundle of manuscript origi- 
nally prepared for publication should 
have waited seventy-six years before 
finding a publisher may in general be taken as fair 
presumptive evidence that the matter is scarcely 
worth printing. But such is not the case with the 
memoirs, diary, and correspondence of Captain 
John Boothby, of the Royal Engineers, a British 
officer of Napoleonic times, which writings are now 
at last issued, under the title of " Under England's 
Flag" (Macmillan). Captain Boothby was a gal- 
lant soldier, and a pious, cheery soul withal, who 
saw much picturesque adventure and some hard 
fighting under Sir John Stuart and Sir John Moore. 
As a raw young subaltern he accompanied Sir 
James Craig on the expedition to Italy and Sicily 
in 1805. In 1808 he went to Sweden with Sir 
John Moore, and in the same year he sailed to join 
that gallant soldier in the Peninsula. The closing 
chapters of the volume narrate Captain Boothby's 
experiences in the Peninsular campaigns, and in- 
clude an account of the Battle of Corunna. The 
style of the book, notably of the many letters it 
contains, is lively and graphic, and one gets from 
it an impression of a rarely pure and engaging 
character. Some of the Spanish and Portuguese 
adventures remind one not a little of Borrow 
though we do not mean to charge the Captain, who 
is clearly the soul of truth, with honest Lavengro's 
addiction to the long bow. There are a number 
of illustrations, including some quaint pen-drawings 
from the author's diary. 

As a literary man King James the 
First of England has fared better 
than many of his contemporaries of 
eqnal or greater ability. His " Counterblaste to 
Tobacco," for example, has been published in no 
less than eight different editions : 1604, 1616, 1619 



(in Latin). 1672. 1689 (in Latin), 1869 (Arber's 
edition). 1872 (Hindley's edition), and 1900, in 
Mr. R. W. Rail's neat little volume entitled "A 
Royal Rhetorician" (Brentano's). To be sure, the 
" Counterblaste," while of no great literary value, 
is not bad entertainment for an hour's smoke ; it 
is certainly one of the most readable of the king's 
works. With it Mr. Rait has printed " Ane Schort 
Treatise on Scottis Poesie " and extracts from 
" Essay es of a Prentise " and " The Psalms of 
David Translated." The texts are those of the 
first editions somewhat modernized, qu being re- 
placed by w, and y being used where Mr. Arber 
printed z, which, whatever its history, cannot now 
stand for the sound of z. On page 12, line 11, 
read abow ; line 3, f . b. read it ; on page 85, line 3, 
f. b. add the date, 1620. Difficult woids are en- 
closed in brackets an improvement in convenience 
on the ordinary glossary. Prefixed is an interesting 
study of the writings of King James, in which Mr. 
Rait does full justice to his author without losing 
sight of the mediocrity which marked this royal 
scribbler ; and appended is a list of the king's chief 
writings. The volume is embellished with a portrait 
of the; king, and with facsimiles of the title-page 
of Bishop Montague's edition of 1616 and of the 
Psalms translation published in 1636. 

Sixth in the " Semitic Series " 
(Scribners) the Rev. A. H. Sayce, 
professor of Assyriology at Oxford, 
puts forth " Babylonians and Assyrians," a title 
borne by no less than four volumes of the thirteen 
announced. Mr. Sayce has made an interesting 
book, though he has not been able to escape the 
flavor of the class-room, and he moves slowly amid 
a mass of material that would have been illumina- 
ting if it could have been realized. Among the 
important disclosures of the narrative is the knowl- 
edge given of the great money lending and banking 
firm of Egibi, founded somewhat before the day of 
Sennacherib, and extending its history down through 
the period of the Persian conquest. This institu- 
tion was as dominant a factor in this ancient and 
almost forgotten world as the Rothschilds are in 
the world to-day, its records constituting a most 
valuable discovery. It would appear that in this 
most important branch of commerce, the finance 
of the twentieth century after Christ is no great 
advance upon that of the ninth century before 
Christ, just as the wars of conquest of the two 
periods show " practical " Christianity to be little 
more effective in international morals than the 
worship of Sennacherib's particular Lord of Hosts. 
There is no index an unpardonable omission. 

A handy, lucid The ninth volume of the "Epochs 
bonk on the of Church History" series is Mr. 

Williston Walker's work on "The 
Reformation" (Scribners). The purpose of the 
series, in presenting church history, is apparently 
secured by an omission of purely political relations,

[March 1, 



and an expansion of theological and doctrinal ques- 
tions. There is nothing new in the book, either in 
matter, treatment, or arrangement ; it is merely a 
restatement of the essential facts of the period. 
Nevertheless, the author's work is not without merit, 
for his style is lucid and his presentation interesting. 
It was of course impossible, in the limited space at 
his disposal, for Mr. Walker to cover every detail 
of the Reformation, yet he has succeeded in con- 
veying a very fair impression of the intellectual 
and religious side of the movement. This has been 
done for all European countries save England, for 
which a separate volume in the series is reserved. 
There is a noticeable impartiality of treatment in 
the inevitable comparison between the principal re- 
forming leaders, though the author falls in line 
with modern church writers in ascribing to Me- 
lancthon a liberality and efficiency not commonly 
attributed to him by political and socialistic students. 
These latter more frequently find his actions not 
in harmony with the elevated and non-partisan 
character of his writings, and criticize him for 
very apparent inconsistencies. Mr. Walker's book 
is very readable, and will be of service for handy 
reference. 

An interesting Doubtless the horrors of the Chinese 
account of capital during the recent murderous 

the siege of Pekmg. p ro t e st against European aggression 
are not likely to divest even the most pronounced 
Christians present of the old Adam that is in them. 
Still, it is difficult to see why the Reverend William 
Alexander Parsons Martin, D.D., LL.D., lately 
president of the Chinese Imperial University and 
a mandarin of the second class, should have clad 
himself in heavy marching order, repeating rifle 
and all, and posed before an American camera for 
the frontispiece to "The Siege of Peking" (Revell), 
announced by the publishers as " the first to tell 
the story," and the outbreak it describes as "the 
most unique event in history." Dr. Martin says 
the siege was the act of the imperial government 
of China itself, and he breathes the threats against 
the Chinese, innocent and guilty alike, which have 
made us wonder recently if Islam and Christendom 
are not exchanging their places in respect of the 
manner of tenets and propaganda. There is nothing 
in Dr. Martin's work to show what has been done 
by the Christian Powers to provoke the attack, 
though he admits it was not " wholly unjustifiable." 
His account is a mixture of the old " Trust in God 
and keep your powder dry," which has proved so 
efficacious upon other occasions in the history of 
the American people, and is interesting, even though 
it does not make the most of its opportunities to 
describe the horrors of the siege. 

A " Complete Hand-Book of Havana 
* Cuba" (Rand, McNally & Co.)

year. Mr. Norton is a firm believer in " Cuba 
Libre," to which his book is dedicated, and his

really valuable work, filled with illustrations and 
maps as it is, is noteworthy among its kind for the 
sympathy it shows for the natives. There is no 
attempt at literary expression in the book, but its 
plain, matter-of-fact manner is more praiseworthy 
than much fine writing and false patriotism. The 
hand-book fills a need, and will be useful and 
valuable to all who would know something of the 
island that has played so prominent a part in the 
world's history, and has changed so vastly American 
policy and traditions. 

Teachers and translators of foreign 
languages will find in Professor 
Herbert C. Tolman's little book 
on " The Art of Translating " ( B. H. Sanborn & 
Co.) much sound doctrine and helpful suggestion 
agreeably presented. It is plainly inspired by 
Cauer's " Die Kunst des Uebersetzens," a practical 
little manual designed for the use of teachers of 
the classics, which we would like to see translated 
into English, Professor Tolman's work being in no 
sense a translation or an adaptation of it. Professor 
Tolman also acknowledges his debt to Professor 
W. G. Hale, to whom, he justly adds, " more than 
to any other American scholar we owe the practical 
method of reading Latin now so generally adopted." 
Professor Tolman's eighty odd pages are replete 
with the marks of ripe scholarship, and reflection 
bred of practical experience, and they are so 
brightened with epigram and extract that the reader 
is lured on pleasantly from chapter to chapter for- 
getful of the didactive purpose of the author. 

Pieturetof There is nothing pleasanter in its 

Shakespeare's kind that we know of than a leis- 
country. urely jaunt through leafy Warwick- 

shire, rich in shrines and scenic allurements, and 
as a good pictorial substitute, or preparative, for 
such a jaunt we take pleasure in calling attention 
to John Leyland's copiously illustrated thin octavo 
volume entitled " The Shakespeare Country " 
(Scribners' Importation). The work is essentially 
a picture-book, though the plates are accompanied 
by the indispensable quota of descriptive text. Mr. 
Leyland is to be unreservedly complimented on his 
selection of subjects for illustration, and the plates 
are of good quality mechanically. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Volumes VII. and VIII. of The World's Orators " 
(Putnam), edited by Dr. Guy Carleton Lee, have just 
been received. The first of these volumes completes 
the section devoted to Englishmen, and includes ten 
examples, from Erstine to Gladstone. The other vol- 
ume, edited with the assistance of Dr. Franklin L. 
Riley, is devoted to American secular oratory of the 
eighteenth century. Thirteen men are represented, 
among them being Otis, Hancock, Warren, Henry, 
Hamilton, Washington, and Samuel Adams. Ten of 
the thirteen have portraits. Two more volumes will 
complete this dignified and valuable work.

The third volume of Professor A. B. Hart's " Amer- 
ican History Told by Contemporaries," published by 
the Macmillan Co., covers the period 1783-1845, and 
has for its subject " National Expansion." We are 
glad that this work is nearing completion, because it is 
of the utmost value to teachers of history in our schools 
and colleges, and cannot too soon be placed within their 
reach. The volumes are of such generous dimensions 
that they really serve to illuminate the subject, which 
cannot be said of some of the scrappy source books 
that have recently appeared. There is little benefit to 
be got from the study of source material unless a large 
amount of it is made accessible to the student. It re- 
quires to be delved in, rather than read consecutively. 

Not librarians alone, but private collectors of books 
as well, will find in Mr. Ainsworth Rand Spofford's 
" Book for All Readers " (Putnam) a helpful guide in 
many perplexing matters, and a safe informant upon 
many subjects that must be of interest to all who live 
among books and use them intelligently. The twenty- 
seven chapters of this volume are simply packed with 
pertinent facts relating to their several subjects; such, 
for example, as bindings, book plates, pamphlets, cata- 
loguing, copyright, and most of the subjects that con- 
cern the professional librarian. The product of ripe 
experience, the work is trustworthy, and has, besides, 
no little charm of manner. 

Four new volumes in Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co.'s 
" Silver Series " of English texts for schools provide 
the following material: Rnskin's " Sesame and Lilies," 
edited by Miss Agnes S. Cook; Tennyson's "Lancelot 
and Ekine " and " The Passing of Arthur," edited by 
Mr. James E. Thomas; Goldsmith's "The Traveller" 
and " The Deserted Village," edited by Mr. Frederick 
Tupper; and Arnold's " Sohrab and Rust urn," with 
other poems, edited by Mr. Joseph B. Seabury. 



NOTES. 



" A Life in Song," a volume of poems by Mr. George 
Lansing Raymond, is issued in a second edition by 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

Longfellow's " Giles Corey of the Salem Farms " is 
published, with stage directions, by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. in their " Riverside Literature Series." 

" The Principles of Vegetable-Gardening," by Mr. 
L. H. Bailey, is still another of the series of books upon 
agricultural and horticultural subjects that this indefa- 
tigable writer has been producing during the past few 
years. It is published by the Macmillan Co. 

A new edition of Mr. Robert S. Barrett's " Standard 
Guide to the City of Mexico," is published in the city 
with which it is concerned by the Modern Mexico 
Publishing Co. It seems to be an excellent practical 
handbook, besides being made attractive by a profusion 
of illustrations. 

Mr. Charles L. Bowman, New York, publishes a new 
edition of " Hints for Home Reading," edited by Dr. 
Lyman Abbott. The contents include a series of papers 
by such men as C. D. Warner, H. W. Beecher, F. B. 
Perkins, Mr. H. W. Mabie, Dr. E. E. Hale, which are 
followed by a classified " Book Buyer's Guide." 

A re-issue of " Madame, a Life of Henrietta, Daugh- 
ter of Charles I., and Duchess of Orleans," by Julia 
Cartwright (Mrs. Henry Ady), first published in 1894, 
is imported by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. This care- 



fully written biography of a singularly attractive and 
unfortunate princess, with its lesson of courage and 
patience and cheerfulness, is at all times welcome both 
to the student and to the general reader, and is none 
the worse for that tone of perhaps somewhat excessive 
eulogy which attests the writer's interest in her theme. 

M Notes on Speech-making " and " The Philosophy 
of the Short-Story," both by Professor Brander Mat- 
thews, are two small and readable books published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The contents of both 
have before been printed in other forms, but we are 
glad to have them in the present convenient shape. 

" Brush and Pencil," of Chicago, which has come to 
occupy a place distinctively its own among American 
art journals, has absorbed " The Collector and Art 
Critic " of New York, and the latter publication will 
hereafter cease to exist. " Brush and Pencil " is now 
edited and owned by Mr. F. W. Morton, and under his 
supervision the magazine has of late shown marked im- 
provement in appearance and matter. 

The map reproductions of Mr. B. F. Stevens of Lon- 
don have for years been well known. Of special value 
to Americans and all interested in American history is 
his latest reproduction, "Fac- simile of the Unpublished 
British Headquarters Map of New York and Environs, 
1782." The map is made from the original drawing in 
the War Office, London, and is in 24 sheets which can 
be joined and mounted as a whole for wall use, or kept 
separate in portfolio form. But 100 copies are printed, 
and are offered on subscription only, by Messrs. B. F. 
Stevens & Brown, London, England. 

A German edition of an American scientific mono- 
graph is not often met with, although this compliment 
to sound scholarship is not undeserved by a good many 
of our recent academic productions. Such an honor has 
recently been paid to Professor John H. Huddilston, 
and we have just received (Freiburg i. Br. : Fehsenfeld) 
a handsomely-printed brochure entitled " Die Griech- 
ische Tragodie im Lichte der Vasenmalerei," in which 
we promptly recognize the substance of a monograph 
published in English two or three years ago. The trans- 
lation is by Fraulein Maria Hense. 

Fit zed ward Hall, one of the greatest of American 
philologists and Oriental scholars, died on the first of 
February, at his home in Marlesford, England. He was 
born in New York, in 1825, and was educated at the 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Harvard College. 
In the latter institution he was a classmate of Childs, 
Lane, and Mr. C. E. Norton. An unexpected trip to 
India in search of a runaway brother, proved a turning- 
point in his life, and enlisted him in the ranks of orien- 
talists. He remained in India until 1862, occupying 
various government posts, returning only for a vacation 
in 1859, when Oxford made him a D.C.L. For seven 
years, he made his home in London, where he served 
in various capacities as professor, librarian, and exam- 
iner. In 1869, he removed to Marlesford, where the 
rest of his days were spent. Here he completed bis 
edition of the " Vishnupurana," and began the series of 
works on English philology by which be is best known 
to English and American scholars. His services to the 
" New English Dictionary " and to the " Dialect Dic- 
tionary " were very great, and were given with no other 
thought than that of advancing the science to which his 
life was devoted. Readers of THE DIAL will remember 
the many contributions with which he has enriched its 
pages, and will join with the many thousands of scholars 
who deplore his death.

page colored plates by ELSIE LOUISE SHAW, and no full-page illustrations by MARION 
SATTERLEE. 6oth thousand. Crown 8vo, $2.00 net. 

"Of all the aids to the study of nature none has won a wider popularity than Mrs. William Starr Dana's 
' How to Know the Wild Flowers.' Here accurate science is put in a simple, practical form, and presented 
with unusual grace of style, and the book has become the favorite companion for open-air rambles of flower- 
lovers who were daunted by the dry particularity of the average botany." Evening Post (Chicago). 



HOW TO KNOW THE FERNS

PARSONS (Mrs. Dana). With 144 full-page illustrations, and 6 full-page illustrations from

" This is a notably thorough little volume. The text is not voluminous, and even with its many full- 
page illustrations the book is small ; but brevity, as we are glad to see so many writers on nature learning, is 
the first of virtues in this field. . . . The author of ' How to Know the Ferns ' has mastered her subject, 
and she treats of it with authority." -- Tribune (New York).

The Individual 

A Study of Life and Death. By Prof. 
N. S. SHALER, of Harvard University. 
12mo. Cloth, 81.50. 

The only certain thing is Death. 

The instinct of all creatures is to fear Death. 

Yet it has been powerfully argued that, since 
Death is universal, it must be beneficent. 

The most interesting question before mankind is 
this: What comes after we die .* 

Professor N. S. Shaler of Harvard University has 
grappled with this absorbing question in a scientific 
and reverent spirit. Mr. Shaler has an international 
reputation as a savant. His views are based on pro- 
found study. It is not strange that his new book is 
attracting wide attention. We respectfully recom- 
mend every one that thinks to read this book.

Vaughan, Milton, Jeremy Taylor, Baxter, Bunyan, Butler, the Transition to the Eighteenth Century, etc. 

The Speaker ( London ) : " The reader need go no further than the first page in order to convince himself

BIRTH A NEW CHANCE 

By COLUMBUS BRADFORD. i2mo, $1.50. 
This work is absolutely unique in Christendom. Its 
conclusions may appear to coincide in one essential 
point with the doctrines of Theosophy, but the course 
of reasoning by which they are reached is entirely free 
from mysticism and is in full harmony with the ad- 
vanced teaching of both Science and Religion. All 
who have felt at times the apparent futility of the indi- 
vidual life will be comforted and uplifted by the brave 
optimism of this original book. The main conclusions 
of the work are: The human personality does not 
leave the body at death; the germ of life persists and 
in due time returns to another body; the perfection of 
the race will be realized through the gradual ameliora- 
tion in successive lives of its individual members. 
The working hypothesis of the author is: The dead 
live again by being born again. 



QARCILASO 



By J. B. ELLIS, author of "The Dread and Fear of 

Kings." I2mo, $1.25. 

A clever and amusing story of Spanish life and 
character at a time which is peculiarly interesting to 
Americans, the close of the ifth century. The scenes 
in the earlier part of the story are laid in the " city of 
silk," before the beleaguered walls of Granada, and 
later the hero escapes the spies of the Inquisition by 
joining the Columbus expedition. In Garcilaso the 
author has presented a fine portrait of the Spanish 
hidalgo, ignorantly religious, haughtily courteous, 
arrogantly brave. The Quixotic Garcilaso tells the 
tale himself, and there is a subtle irony in the method 
by which he is made to reveal his foibles while wholly 
unconscious of their existence. The love story is full 
of complications, now serious, now amusing, which 
end happily.

By BRANDER MATTHEWS, D.C.L., Professor of Dra-

** In the final ten years of the nineteenth century an in- 
creasing attention has been paid to the history of fiction and 
to the principles of narrative art. In many of the leading 
American universities the modern novel has been serving as 
the subject for lectures and as the material for private study, 
in the course of which the short-story received a fair share of 
attention. It is in consequence of this incessant discussion of 
modern fiction and of its methods that the author and the 
publishers have been made aware of a demand for the pres- 
ent essay.

HER MOUNTAIN LOVER 

By Hamlin Garland 

Frontispiece by Relyea 

This is the story of a Colorado prospector who 
goes to London with a mine to sell. He invades 
society, shocks it, amuses it, and is lionized by it, 
bnt returns to America, his mine unsold, discour- 
aged and homesick. The mine has increased in 
value while he is away, and the story ends with bis 
winning the love of a charming American girl. It 
is a story of picturesque contrasts, and its hero sug- 
gests a masculine counterpart of " Daisy Miller." 
Perhaps the word " breezy " characterizes it better 
than any other. The author has written several 
successful books, bnt in the judgment of many this 
is his best and most entertaining effort as a fiction 
writer. 12mo, 396 pages, $150. 



EAST LONDON 

By Sir Walter Besant 

Illustrated by Phil May, Joseph Pennell, and 
L. Raven-Hill 

In these sketches of London's East Side there is 
a subtle penetration and delineation of motives like 
that to be found in Dickens's " Uncommercial Trav- 
eller." A study of types, it is none the less a study 
of class principles, psychological and metaphysical, 
but never heavy. The author is thoroughly con- 
versant with his subject, and is one of the most 
delightful of English writers. His book " All Sorts 
and Conditions of Men " suggested the famous Peo- 
ple's Palace. The illustrations in " East London " 
are many and interesting ; they include character 
studies by Phil May and L. Raven-Hill, with views by 
Joseph Pennell. 8vo, 364 pages, richly bound, $3.50. 



THE WIZARD'S KNOT

A designing mother and a strong-willed son play

try and domineering landholders- in Ireland fifty 
years ago. The wizard's knot is a tangled one, and 
the book teems with incident and adventure. The 
author, a Catholic priest, is welt known to novel-

and " The Two Standards." ISmo, 406 pages, $1.50.

OLD BOWEN'S LEGACY 

By Edwin Asa Dix 

In this story of New England life the author 
works out a plot involving a recluse, who at dying 
leaves his money to be disbursed by three trustees, 
and a man who separates himself from his family 
and mankind through his chronic inclination to brood 
over fancied wrongs. Mr. Dix's previous novel, 
"Deacon Bradbury," has been one of the hits of the 
past season, and in the present book several of the 
same characters are reintroduced. ISmo, 289 pages, 
$1.50. 

THE PRINCE OF ILLUSION 

By John Luther Long 

The Prince is a little blind boy, and the Illusion 
is his belief that he is a real prince. This is instilled 
into him by his mother, who seeks to keep him 
always unconscious of his squalid surroundings. The 
same author's " Madame Butterfly " has been very 
successful, the dramatization being equally so. 12mo,

action is rapid and brilliant. The struggle between 
the League and Henry IV. furnishes the motif of the 
book. This has been the most popular serial novel 
ever printed in The Century Magazine. One well- 
known critic calls it " the greatest piece of historical 
fiction ever produced by an American." ISmo, JfiQ

TWO NOTABLE BOOKS 



BERGEN'S FOUNDATIONS OF BOTANY 

By JOSEPH Y. BERGEN, Instructor in Biology in the English High School, 

Boston, and author of "Elements of Botany." For Introduction, $1.50. 

A NOTHER notable book by Mr. Bergen, whose "Elements of Botany'"'' has come to be the most widely 
** used recent text-book on the subject in higher schools and academies. It is not intended to take the 
place of the Elements, but to offer a more extended and comprehensive course for schools that wish to devote 
an entire year to the subject. The flora includes seven hundred species. The descriptions are written in the 
very simplest language consistent with accuracy, and technical terms are omitted in every case where ordinary 
language is sufficiently concise and accurate to answer the purpose. 

STORIES OF PLANT LIFE 

(BEADY IN APRIL) 

By GEORGE F. ATKINSON, Professor of Botany in Cornell University. 

T N this new book is presented the unusual and attractive combination of rare scholarship with great felicity 
1 in writing for young people. The object in presenting these studies in the form of " Stories of Plant Life " 
has been to interest the child and pupil in the life and -work of plants. 

Part IV., "Life Stories of Plants," the author has presented in the form of biographies. This feature of 
" reading" the stories which plants have to tell forms the leading theme which runs through the book. The 
plants talk by a "sign language," which the pupil is encouraged to read and interpret. This method lends 
itself in a happy manner as an appeal to the child's power of interpretation of the things which it sees. 

This book, by so great an authority as Professor Atkinson, is certain to provide for the child and the 
teacher a source from which to obtain both profit and enjoyment.

THE PRICES OF BOOKS. 

For a number of years past, the condition 
of the bookselling trade has been a matter of 
much concern, not only to the booksellers and 
publishers immediately interested, but also to 
the wider public that takes an interest in all 
questions affecting popular culture. The prac- 
tice of publishing books at a fictitious price, 
never actually demanded, is quite indefensible ; 
and the custom of selling books at all sorts 
of discounts, based upon " what the traffic will 
bear," if not strictly indefensible, is at least 
so demoralizing to the trade that some effort 
to secure uniformity of practice is well worth 
making. Under the stress of the forces of 
competition, the book business has suffered 
severely in both directions from the side of 
the publisher and dealer alike and the effect 
upon the general public has been equally un- 
fortunate, for the old-time bookstore has almost 
disappeared from the social economy of all but 
a few of our largest cities. The individual 
purchaser of books, allured by the inducements 
of dealers in general merchandise or by the 
advertisements of houses of supply in the large 
cities sometimes even by the direct bid of 
injudicious publishers for the retail trade 
has deserted the local bookseller, and forced 
him either to retire from business, or to add 
all sorts of " notions " and * k side lines " to his 
stock, thereby becoming a very different sort 
of person from the bookseller of a generation 
or two ago. 

After a long period of agitation of these 
vexed questions, the publishers of the country 
have at last realized the necessity of concerted 
action, and have agreed upon a plan, to be put 
into general operation the first of May, which 
it is hoped will restore something like uni- 
formity to the system of discounts, make the 
retail price of a given book the same wherever 
purchased, and cause whatever booksellers have 
survived the demoralizing conditions of recent 
years to take heart for the future. Since the 
"plan in question is put forward by the Ameri- 
can Publishers Association, and agreed upon 
by nearly all the large and reputable houses, 
there is at least a fair chance that it will 



180 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



accomplish its purposes. At all events, the 
outcome of the experiment about to be made 
will be watched for with eager interest by 
all who are intelligent enough to understand 
the importance to the whole public of a 
healthful activity in all the branches of the 
book trade. 

The essential features of the plan proposed 
are presented in the following summary. All 
copyright books sold under ordinary trade con- 
ditions are to be listed at net prices, which 
prices shall be substantially those now actually 
charged by the leading booksellers. Every 
intelligent purchaser knows that the real price 
of a book is only eighty per cent of the ficti- 
tious price advertised, and the fictitious price 
is now to be suppressed altogether. From this 
arrangement school books, subscription books, 
and works of current fiction are to be excluded. 
The publishers then agree to sell their books 
only to such dealers as will maintain the net 
retail prices set upon them. Thus the book- 
seller who cuts his prices will also cut himself 
off from obtaining further supplies. Libraries 
are to receive a discount of ten per cent from 
retail prices, and the discount to booksellers 
is to be twenty-five per cent, although this 
latter stipulation is not binding upon publish- 
ers. A year after publication, the restriction 
upon booksellers shall cease, although the 
publisher may then have the right to repur- 
chase all copies which may remain unsold, at 
the price which was originally paid for them. 
When the publisher sells his own books at 
retail, he shall add to the list price the express 
or postal charges to all customers from out 
of town, instead of mailing " postpaid," as is 
now the universal custom excepting with 
"net" books. 

The result of the operation of the plan thus 
outlined is obvious enough. If the publishers 
concerned shall live up to this agreement in 
good faith, there will be an end of the under- 
selling of new copyright books by department 
stores and dealers in miscellaneous goods. 
There will also be an end of retail mail orders 
sent direct to publishers from towns that have 
booksellers of their own. The local bookseller 
will be sure of a reasonable profit upon his 
sales, and will be encouraged to work up his 
hitherto languishing trade. The department 
stores will suffer no real loss, and will prob- 
ably find bookselling as profitable as ever, 
although no longer able to lure the book-buyer 
from his proper allegiance, except in the case 



of popular novels, which will remain unaffected 
by the new arrangement. This is, of course, 
a very large exception, and it cannot be de- 
fended as a logical one. But it is best not to 
be too radical all at once, and we think that 
the publishers have acted wisely in admitting 
this compromise. If the plan works well in 
other respects, it will be no difficult matter to 
bring fiction within its scope in the near future. 
Indeed, we augur well for the new departure 
chiefly because it is so moderate in its terms. 
So limited a measure of reform as this has ten 
times the chances of success that a thorough- 
going reform would have. And yet, limited 
as it is, we think that it can accomplish much 
for the encouragement of legitimate booksell- 
ing, and for the rehabilitation of one of the 
worthiest and most civilizing of human occu- 
pations. 

The example of the German book trade has 
been chiefly influential in determining this 
plan of the American publishers. The general 
system for controlling prices, as now proposed 
for this country, has long been in successful 
operation among German publishers and book- 
sellers, with results that fully justify its wis- 
dom. Although opposed in Germany by a few 
obdurate undersellers, the opposition has not 
been sufficiently formidable to interfere seri- 
ously with the plan, and is now almost com- 
pletely overcome. The result has been, and is, 
that German books are sold at uniform prices 
throughout the Empire, and, what is far more 
important, the German bookseller is enabled 
to earn a livelihood from his business. Every 
German town of any size has at least one well- 
appointed book-shop, and this condition of af- 
fairs is so warmly appreciated by the public 
that few voices would now be raised in favor 
of a return to the old disastrous system of com- 
petitive underselling. It is distinctly worth 
while to increase slightly the cost of books to 
individual purchasers, if thereby the business 
of dealing in books may be kept in the hands 
of bookmen, and if books of all sorts may thus 
be brought within the easy reach of book- 
buyers. 

In expressing our approval of this plan, as 
about to be inaugurated in the American trade, 
we are not blinking the fact that it means 
higher retail prices for a good many books. 
As a general rule, we believe in the most open 
and unrestricted competition in business af- 
fairs, and are opposed to regulations, whether 
public or private, in restraint of trade. But 



1901.] 



THE DIAL, 



181 



it seems to us that the book trade is of so pecul- 
iar a nature, and bears so important a relation 
to the culture of the community, that it de- 
serves to be dealt with on an exceptional basis. 
However sound in principle the doctrine of 
unrestricted competition may be, its rigorous 
application to the present case would seem to 
suggest the doctrinaire theorist rather than the 
philosophical observer. It is a form of trade 
protection, no doubt, but, however sinister the 
associations of that word, fair-minded people 
must admit that there are instances in which 
protection is the policy of wisdom rather than 
of selfish interest. This seems to us to be 
clearly one of those instances, and we assert 
without hesitation that a flourishing book trade 
is of such vital importance to the civilization 
of any community that a community may prop- 
erly be taxed for its support. The tax in 
question will be a small one, and its incidence 
will be upon the persons most directly bene- 
fitted. which seems to us all that need be urged 
in its defence. 



INTERMITTENT IDEALISM. 



It would be hard to believe that Milton ever 
doubted of the poetic vision, or would have ex- 
changed it. if he could, for a practical view of life. 
His weighing of the matter in " Lycidas " is evi- 
dently more for the sake of argument, to set forth 
the grounds of his impregnable conviction, than to 
voice any question of his own mind. He was too 
thorough-going an idealist, even in the days when 
sportive Amaryllis conld allure, to be seriously 
moved by the pleasures or practices of others. His 
profound and capacious nature was stayed on itself 
in a composure whence no accident or affliction 
could drive it A spirit privileged, like his, to con- 
template all time and all existence could withstand 
with ease shocks that perturb or destroy smaller 
souls, attractions that would draw them from their 
orbits. 

It is not, however, a common privilege to view 
in this large ab extra way the matters which make 
up one's personal share of conscious existence. If 
hell and heaven were opened to an ordinary mortal, 
in a vision like Dante's, no such tremendous effect 
would be produced. The traveller would return, 
like other personally conducted tourists, with scarce 
a recollection of the things he saw. If he did re- 
member some singular impression, it would be to 
congratulate himself on having only familiar ex- 
periences to deal with thereafter. The value of 
such observation as against commonly received 
opinion would be insignificant. The joys of the 



Paradiso would distil no life-long sweetness in his 
heart. For the bartering and selling and envy- 
ing and talking of everyday life are more real 
than the eternal verities to him who is not born 
with the mystic vision, and would be, though one 
rose from the dead to tell. Honest Sancho has 
been proved right so often that even the would-be 
Quixote gives over denying, and begins to lose 
faith himself. 

Indeed, the idealistic temperament is a gift as 
inconvenient as some we read of in old fairy tales, 
which may fall into bad hands, which bring suffer- 
ing if ill-used, and yet cannot be got rid of. This 
talisman may diffuse the steady glow that warms 
and transfigures, or it may yield but a flickering 
flame. Sometimes, as with Burns, its fitful illumi- 
nation reveals the rocks on which the hopeless 
mariner drives, but is not strong enough to enable 
him to steer clear. Sometimes we follow the vague 
gleam until we feel, as the poet dough did of Car- 
lyle's impassioned leadership, that it has led us out 
into the wilderness to die. 

Despondency is a frequent enough mood in the 
most practical career, whose rewards are patent to 
all, and which has the approval of the whole world. 
How much larger must be the natural proportion 
of discouragement in attempts which lie outside the 
sphere of common effort, and whose success, if 
recognizable, attracts but cold attention. Minds 
enamored of perfection have a wintry road to travel 
in a world where the expedient and relative alone 
are appreciated. To run a race with straining con- 
testants at your heels, amid the plaudits of sympa- 
thizing acquaintance, with a great prize in sight, is 
quite different from a lonely sprint, without spec- 
tators, toward an elusive goal which everybody 
pronounces an optical illusion. The bravest run- 
ners are weighed down by the tacit opposition, as 
by heavy atmospheric pressure. Wordsworth even, 
with all his deliberate planning to live the life of 
the spirit, had his moments when he prayed for 
pagan faith, that he might recapture his lost sense 
of the hidden beauty of the world. For him some- 
times, as for poor Susan in his song, 

" The stream would not flow, and the bill would not rise, 
And the colors had all passed away from his eyes." 

And Shakespeare, the most wonderful mind, so far 
as we know, that the human race has ever produced, 
tells what he feels, 

" When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, 
I, all alone, beweep my outcast state, 
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, 
And look upon myself, and curse my fate, 
Wishing me more like to one more rich in hope, 
Featured like him, like him with friends possest, 
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, 
With what I most enjoy contented least." 

If these are the feelings with which the sons of 
Phoebus are at times overwhelmed, what must be 
the dismay and weakening of the knees of the com-

mon mortal who essays this quest. Uneasy regret 
for him that turns hack ; no complacent success for 
the victor ; between the two, all variations of defeat 
and discouragement. 

But ah, what compensation ! After Lowell has 
given the details of the Florentine's exile, he adds 
these words : " Looked at outwardly, Dante's life 
was an utter and disastrous failure. What its in- 
ward satisfactions were, we, with the Paradiso 
open before us, can form some faint conception." 
Newman says, in his Apologia, that he used to wish 
that the Arabian Tales were true. His imagination 
ran on unseen influences, magical powers, and talis- 
mans. The human soul has other ways of escaping 
its limitations, and these influences need not be in- 
voked with such potentialities within. In the son- 
net quoted from above, Shakespeare is absorbed in 
forced contemplation of conventional values, when 
the thought of his love suffices to release him, and, 
like the lark, rising from sullen earth, straightway 
his soul mounts and sings at heaven's gate. One 
may be held by peremptory custom and have prac- 
tical views thrust upon one, until resistance seems 
useless, and the voice of the majority is admitted 
to be the voice of God. One rush of disinterested 
feeling, an evening sky, the pure outline of a distant 
hill, and the old charm is set working, and the 
spirit is released. Lines of verse, by no means 
didactifc, sometimes work this transformation, when 
the most powerful exhortations of Emerson or 
Browning or Carlyle have been ineffectual. Lan- 
dor's lines to Rose Aylmer have no connection with 
effort of any kind, yet they have this melting quality 
to me. With the haunting music of " Rose Ayl- 
mer " in my ears, I can shake off any weight of 
freezing custom, and do the impossible in chasing 
the flying goal. Marlowe and those other Eliza- 
bethan playwrights loved the sound of Greek, though 
they knew not a word of it, because it had such a 
thundering sound, as if it conjured devils. We 
know that certain words, as well as holy water, did 
conjure devils in the romantic Middle Age ; and, 
sure, certain dark fears and doubts that vex men's 
minds now, may be exorcised by means as simple 
and irrelevant. The subterranean life from which 
great impulses come, does not respond to logical 
appeals. That naive old lady who drew such con- 
solation from the rich sound of the word Mesopo- 
tamia, knew the potency of suggestion to open 
charmed, magic casements upon large and noble 
scenes. At a touch, apparently remote and power- 
less, the importunate claims of society, the involved 
situations that cramp and school the soul to petty 
issues, yea, the great globe itself and all which 
it inherit, may, like the baseless fabric of a vision, 
fade into thin air, and leave but the freed spirit 
face to face with immensity. In the revolution of 
feeling Shakespeare describes in his sonnet, no ex- 
ternal change has taken place. Others have ad- 
vantages generally prized which he has not. This 
is the occasion of his grief, though the real cause 



probably lay in a deeper dissatisfaction. Suddenly 
a tender thought wells up from the unconscious 
deep. He is no richer, handsomer, greater than 
before, yet now he would not change his state with 
kings. This is your true idealist. The impulse, 
denied to his prayer of anguish, has come unfore- 
seen, but here it is, and " the moon, it is under his 
feet." In a twinkling, this mortal has put on im- 
mortality. From a clod, a thing of causes and 
effects, he is become a living soul and lays hold on 

eternal life.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



A MUCH-NEEDED REFORM IN OUR GREAT 

DAILIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

You conclude a note in a recent issue of THE DIAL, 
calling attention to the fact that one of the prominent 
daily papers of the Atlantic coast is about to seek the 
collaboration of specialists and scholars in various fields 
for its reviews of current contributions to literature, 
with these words: "This is the way in which the thing 
ought to be done, and we wish that other journals 
would follow so excellent an example." Upon this 
most excellent text I should like to preach a very 
short sermon. That this is the only way in which 
it ought to be done, is one of those obvious propo- 
sitions that needs only to be clearly stated to gain en- 
dorsement. 

How far it is a good thing that the great dailies have 
invaded so comprehensively the field of criticism of 
books, is a question that need not be decided in this 
connection. That they have done so and will continue 
to do so is obvious; and I am equally convinced that, 
if it be wisely done, the good will far outweigh the in- 
cidental evils. Every publisher knows how large a part 
of his copies for review go to the great dailies, and how 
frequently his press notices must be compiled from the 
same source. In the aggregate, the papers are influ- 
encing the opinions on matters of literature of an 
enormous proportion of the wisely-reading and of the 
unwisely-reading public. Their responsibilities are large, 
however lightly they may be carried. Many an excel- 
lent daily paper (I mean relatively so, in contrast to 
the many more that are worse) is well made up, obvi- 
ously gives special attention to its various departments, 
but fails utterly on the score of its book-reviews. I 
fancy that the volumes which too confiding publishers 
send on a venture to the best papers are swept together 
periodically and carried off by some omnivorous but 
most undiscerniug reader, who reviews or concocts no- 
tices of them of various degrees of merit or the absence 
of it. On the topics that interest him he produces 
something readable or at least coherent; the others are 
smudged over with a non-committal paragraph which 
means black or white or any intermediate shade of 
grey. These neutral, conventionally-phrased, damned- 
with-faint-praise testimonials are easily recognizable in 
collections of " press-notices." 

I have mainly in mind the great dailies away from 
the Atlantic coast, which are, indeed, the worst offend- 
ers in this respect. I have specially in mind the paper

which stimulates the digestion of my breakfast, which 
certainly is careful as to its political and general news, 
its foreign items, its editorials, its sports, and its ac- 
counts of crime; which also contains an admirable 
musical and dramatic column; but whose book-reviews, 
and indeed all attempts to consider matters of science 
or literature in any part of its columns, are shockingly 
bad. Not always so, for when the professional book- 
reviewer gets hold of a book which is in his line, he pro- 
duces a creditable notice. The wrong is that he should 
be called upon to give utterance to criticisms upon 
things which he does not understand, even if he reads 
them which in some cases is doubtful. 

Within a short time I recall two contributions which 
may be given as concrete examples. The one was an 
editorial on a sensational announcement of a scientific 
worker of no unquestioned standing, in which were 
massed such a collection of gross errors and misconcep- 
tions as would hardly be excusable in a high school 
pupil. The other was a review of a book in regard to 
which every remark made was utterly inappropriate, 
and would have been about equally pertinent if the 
book had been Webster's Dictionary or Euclid's geom- 
etry, instead of, as it was, a series of essays on certain 
popular phases of science. The very next day appeared 
a laudatory appreciation of a manual of the most un- 
scientific, superstitious kind which was not worth serious 
attention, and then (all probably by the same hand) a 
good and worthy review of a volume which the reviewer 
had read and appreciated. 

This is the absurdity of the way in which the great 
dailies issue opinions on literary and scientific matters; 
this is what makes " newspaper science " a term of deri- 
sion, and brings it about that you can find wholesale 
laudation of almost any effusion which an author can 
persuade or bribe a publisher to print. The remedy is 
obvious. It is to have this work at least as carefully 
allotted as the various departments of the sporting 
page, and have books reviewed and editorials written 
by persons who are acquainted with the particular facts 
and opinion discussed, not by one who must profession- 
ally pose as a concentrated omniscience. Within the 
reach of the great dailies are professors at the Univer- 
sities, and specialists in all departments, who should be 
willing to assume this function as part of their civic ob- 
ligations; and it should be the policy of the great 
dailies, if they review books at all, to be willing to have 
it properly done and make the doing of it an attractive 
privilege to the scholar and the specialist. The notion 
that the scholar is not to be trusted, is given to fads, 
will not abide by practical conditions of space and read- 
ability, may be true of a small minority, but in regard 
to the great majority of whom such service would nat- 
urally be asked, it is simply a superstition, a survival 
in current beliefs kept alive by the jokes and jibes of 
the mentally impoverished paragrapher. The great 
dailies have no excuse in this direction. It is in most 
cases a neglect due to a lack of appreciation of their 
possibilities and their responsibilities, and one which, it 
is hoped, they will be anxious to atone for as speedily 
and as effectively as may be possible. As disseminators 
of opinion upon all topics which they decide to fall 
within their scope, it should be the aim and the boast 
of the dailies that they print the fittest news, and the 
most reliable opinions, even including the news and 
opinions of the world of science and letters and art.

THE EDITING OF POE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The distress of your correspondent, " S.," in THE 
DIAL for Feb. 1, over the supposed misquotation in 
Mr. Stedman's Anthology, is another straw which shows 
how set the winds of American appreciation of Poe. 
Our poets, even Poe, are household poets, well-loved, 
memorized, but not critically studied. Now Poe is the 
only one of them of whose works we have something 
like a definitive critical edition, and yet so little is that 
known that a supposed error in Mr. Stedman's Anthol- 
ogy does not suggest a comparison with Messrs. Sted- 
man and Woodberry's Poe. I can scarcely conceive of 
an Englishman using his Tennyson thus. 

The communication is further interesting as showing 
the futility of a priori aesthetic reasoning. " Gray eye 
glances " is called a " distressing alliteration " of which 
Poe would have been incapable! Yet Tennyson changed 
" The tall masts quiver'd as they lay afloat " (" Dream 
of Fair Women ") to " The high masts flicker'd as they 
lay afloat," and, though the change was compelled by 
other changes in the same stanza, the alliteration was 
not found offensive. And how should alliteration have 
been offensive to the poet of " weak and weary," 
"quaint and curious," "nodded, nearly napping," 
"named Lenore "? The simple fact is that we are used 
to "dark eye glances"; and poets may take a lesson 
upon the danger of changing their printed text. " These 
old shoes," said Emerson, " are easy to my feet." 

The really interesting question under all this is the 
wisdom of Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry's adoption 
of Poe's marginal emendations. Their general principle, 
which they defend, is doubtless right, and it would be 
too delicate a task (a priori reasoning again) to decide 
that the principle should be departed from in any par- 
ticular instance. Yet in this instance " gray eyes " 
was substituted after 1845, and Poe's judgment in those 
latter disastrous years might well be questioned. Was 
the change made for purely aesthetic reasons, or out of 
personal caprice ? We might at least be pardoned for 
preferring to keep the color of the eyes which originally 
inspired the poem. A. G. NEWCOMER.

"PROFESSOR TRIGQS ON PROFESSOR WENDELL." 

-A REPLY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read, in your issue of March 1, Mr. Gardner 
TealFs comments on my criticism of Professor Barrett 
Wendell. I am very sure that when Mr. Gardner Teall 
comes to read " A Literary History of America " he 
will not be tempted himself and he will not in the least 
understand my temptation. Living in the midst of 
Massachusetts culture and Massachusetts Transcenden- 
talism and Massachusetts Unitarianism, he can never be 
made to feel how little these things enter into the con- 
sciousness of one who has lived in the South and West, 
and he will read Professor Wendell's 479 pages on Amer- 
ican Literature in Boston with perfect contentment, and 
dismiss the Rest of the Story with a single chapter. 

My questions were asked in all seriousness and were 
intended to arouse thought. That they do not appear 
as an " examination test " is proven by the fact that 
Mr. Teall attempts to answer them without having read 
the book under discussion. (But perhaps Mr. Teall 
acquired this habit when he was at Harvard.) If I 
was rude and irreverent it was because of bad manners 
acquired by association with the class of " social de-

generates " that Mr. Wendell declares to have settled 
in the West the class that produced Lincoln and 
Grant. We have had the advantages of nothing better 
than missionary stations most of us, like Eugene 
Field, were only lately driven out of the trees. 

Mr. Teall's answer to one question propounded is not 
very convincing. If one is to write a literary history 
of America he should take account of all the literatures 
of America : if he confines himself to literature in En- 
glish should he call his work " A Literary History of 
America "? What lies back of the Mardi Gras festival 
at New Orleans must surely balance the life forces of 
New England Transcendentalism. 

Mr. Teall's suggestion for chronicling the literary 
doings of the United States by parishes strikes me as 
a good one. When Mr. Teall finishes his Whitman and 
his Wendell I hope he will read the two volumes on 
the literature of Indiana reviewed by Mr. Martin W. 
Sampson in THE DIAL of March 1. Indiana is a typical 
Western parish. The writer of " The Hoosiers," Mr. 
Sampson remarks, " traces the growth of the intellec- 
tual life within the State, from its territorial beginnings 
to the present day; the varying make-up of its popu- 
lation; the individual marks of its most characteristic 
institutions and towns: in short, he soberly essays a 
chapter in American cultur-geschicte, dealing with the 
State whose life he knows from within." The other 
volume is a book of selections from Indiana poets 
one hundred and forty-six in number. There would 
certainly be no blank page for this parish, and perhaps 
material enough (with Riley, Thompson, Evaleen Stein, 
and a few others, as demi-gods) for as considerable a 
mythology as has been developed in Massachusetts. 
Upon the blank pages reserved for other parishes I 
would indeed write passages from Whitman: upon one 
I would inscribe " Unnamed Lands," on another " There 
Was a Child Went Forth," on toother "The Ox- 
Tamer," on another (if there should be that many 
blanks) " Laws for Creations." I am more inclined to 
this suggestion, because, as I gather from answers to 
my questions received from New Orleans and San 
Francisco, this is precisely the method pursued by Mr. 
Wendell only he has filled up the blanks with Ref- 
erences and Index. 

And I have one more question upon the general 
theme : What justification is there for the time-honored 
belief that a man is not historically significant until he 
is dead ? If the rule is to be broken in the case of 
Mark Twain, why need it be obeyed in other instances ?

THE FIRST COUNTY LIBRARY IN THE UNITED 

STATES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of January 16, 1901, Mr. E. I. Antrim 
states that the " Brumbach " Library of Van Wert, O., 
founded January 1 last, was the first county library in 
the United States. If Mr. Antrim will consult Mr. 
N. D. C. Hodges, Librarian, Cincinnati, O., he will learn 
that the Public Library of Cincinnati was made a pub- 
lic county library a short time before September 1, 
1899. Also, by writing Mrs. S. B. Maxwell, of Mead- 
ville, Pa., he will learn that the Norris-Jewett Library, 
for the county of Trenton, Mo., which Mrs. Maxwell 
organized and catalogued, was founded in 1894. I 
write to correct the error of Mr. Antrim's statement. 

Meadville, Pa., March 1, 1901. A ' L - DAY< 



We are glad to note that one of the two at- 
tractive companion volumes containing selected 
writings of the late Eugene Schuyler contains 
also a Memoir wherein the public services of 
Mr. Schuyler during his long and varied dip- 
lomatic and consular career are interestingly, 
if summarily, set forth. Besides the Memoir 
this volume embraces the paper on "Count 
Leo Tolstoy Twenty Years Ago "; a consular 
reminiscence entitled " The Minnesota Heir of 
a Serbian King "; and a short story (the au- 
thor's only excursion into the field of fiction), 
entitled "The Lost Plant." In the fellow 
volume are assembled, besides two or three 
hitherto unpublished papers, a score or so of 
Mr. Schuyler's foreign letters to "The Nation," 
and these are, we need scarcely say, altogether 
model productions of their kind pleasant lit- 
erary and descriptive causeries with a flavor of 
scholarship that lifts them quite above the 
common run of newspaper letters. The vol- 
umes, it may be added, are separately indexed, 
and each is complete in itself, though they are 
meant to be shelf companions. 

Mr. Schuyler was born at Ithaca, N. Y., Feb. 
26, 1840, of virtually pure Dutch ancestry. 
He was, his sister and affectionate biographer 
records, a pretty and clever child, fond of 
books, flowers, pictures, music, and " good 
things to eat," and blessed, or perhaps afflicted, 
with so fastidious a sense of the relations be- 
tween taste and smell that he used to insist on 
the union on the dinner-table of certain flowers 
with certain viands sweet peas, for instance, 
being in the opinion of this young Sybarite 
the indispensable floral associate of roast beef. 
As a boy Mr. Schuyler attended the Ithaca 
Academy, acquitting himself with such lustre 
in his brief grapple with the curriculum of 
that institution that the trustees were moved 
to present him on parting (when he was about 
twelve years of age) with three large volumes 
of "Selections from the British Poets." With- 
out looking this formidable gift horse too 
openly in the mouth Eugene intimated, with 
some discernment, that on the whole he would

rather have the complete works of one poet 
than another man's selections from the works 
of all of them. At fifteen he was entered at 
Yale College, where, we learn, he worked not 
for honors bat from natural love of learning. 
Honors came, however, a Clark premium 
for proficiency in Latin in his junior year, and 
in his senior year a Berkeley prize for Latin 
composition. He was graduated fifth in a class 
of over a hundred, and had the rank of Philo- 
sophical Oration, taking also the Berkeley and 
Clark Scholarships. A classmate of Schuyler's, 
Professor Wright, of Yale, has testified warmly 
to his personal charm and refinement, his pre- 
cocious attainments, and natural taste and ap- 
titude for exact scholarship and broad culture. 
After graduating, in 1859, Mr. Schuyler 
remained at New Haven for two years, and 
was the first to receive there, in 1861, the de- 
gree of Doctor of Philosophy. He studied law 
at Columbia College, and, after a period of 
preparatory office work, began practice with 
Mr. James Bruyn Andrews as partner. His 
bent for literature showed itself early. During 
the period of his law studies he wrote pretty 
constantly for the " Round Table," the " New 
Path," the "New Englander," and the " North 
American Review," and was a contributor to 
** The Nation " from the time of its first ap- 
pearance to the end of his life. In 1867 he 
published a translation of Turguenief 's " Fath- 
ers and Sons," and this was shortly followed 
by his edition of Professor Porter's transla- 
tions from the " Kalevala," a task for which, 
with his usual thoroughness, he prepared him- 
self by learning Finnish in order to master the 
poem in the original. The practice of law was 
not especially to Mr. Schuyler's taste, and in 
1867 he forsook Themis for the foreign ser- 
vice, obtaining an appointment as Consul at 
Moscow. On the way to his post he formed 
some notable acquaintances that of M. Taine 
at Paris, of Sainte-Beuve, and of Turguenief, 
who gave him a letter of introduction to Tol- 
stoy. Mr. Schuyler had the social gift, and 
was, in fact, socially as well as officially always 
persona gratissima at the various courts to 
which he was, during his long career abroad, 
accredited. At Moscow, as later at St. Peters- 
burg, he was even, as his biographer assures 
us with a certain touch of " Mrs. Jarley," the 
" enfant gate " of the native nobility and gen- 
try, from Prince Odoiefsky downward. Of 
his friend the Prince, Mr. Schuyler wrote in 
1867: 

"... I dined last night with the Prince Vladimir 



Oddiefsky, enfamille, with his wife and one young man 
whose name I can't recall. The Prince is an agreeable 
old man of about sixty-five, a bibliophile, with a splen- 
did library which overflows every room except one 
salon, where plants in profusion take the place of books. 
. . . The Prince is also a musician. Nothing would do 
but I must try a duet with him ; so we played half a 
dozen, apparently to his satisfaction, for he compli- 
mented me a good deal, and then showed me, as a 
special favor, a piano he had had made on mathemat- 
ical principles. ... I pleased the old lady by showing 
her a new game of solitaire, and am invited to a salon 
on Friday evening, when I am to be introduced to the 
haute societe of Moscow." 

With the change of administration in 1869 
came the usual division of spoils. Mr. Schuyler 
seems to have ingenuously fancied that his 
proved special fitness for his post would cause 
his retention in it. He was soon undeceived. 
During a trip to Kief he received information 
that he had been superseded, and that his pay 
had stopped some weeks before. The consul- 
ship at Revel (something by no means " equally 
as good ") was offered him ; but in the mean- 
time Mr. Curtin, the new Minister to Russia, 
who knew absolutely nothing of the ways or 
speech of the people to whom he was sent, 
found himself obliged to blink political con- 
siderations and select a subordinate who could 
supply his deficiencies. Accordingly Mr. 
Schuyler went to St. Petersburg as Secretary 
of Legation, where he soon became a notable 
and even a leading figure in diplomatic circles. 
Mr. Curtin resigned in 1872, and was suc- 
ceeded by Mr. Orr, through whom Mr. Schuy- 
ler obtained a leave of absence which enabled 
him to visit Central Asia a region just then 
specially interesting as the new field of Russian 
political enterprise. Mr. Schuyler's journey 
was an arduous one, but he returned well laden 
with information, which was embodied later in 
his book on Central Asia, as well as, it may be 
added, in the famous report for the State 
Department, the frankness of which raised 
quite a gale of excitement in Russian official 
circles at the time. This report was prepared 
at the request of Mr. Jewell (Mr. Orr's suc- 
cessor at St. Petersburg) who, like Mr. Schuy- 
ler, supposed it would be considered a confi- 
dential document. The Department, however, 
published, in the Red Book of December, 1874, 
Mr. Schuyler's blunt account of Russian in- 
iquities in the new satrapy, and a great hubbub 
ensued. 

Mr. Schuyler's report bore good fruit in 
the shape of reforms in Central Asia, and it is 
an error to suppose that his frankness em- 
broiled him with the Russian Government

always ready to wink at the reprehensible acts 
of its agents so long as they go on unnoticed 
of the world and to Russia's material profit, 
and to disclaim them when notoriety and pub- 
lic clamor seem to imperil the testamentary 
policy of the great Czar. In 1880 Mr. Schuyler 
wrote to a friend : 

" I suppose it is impossible to eradicate a popular 
error, but the Russian Government never found fault 
with me in any way or shape, and never hinted at my 
recall either in St. Petersburg or Washington ... I 
remained after that (the publication of the Report) as 
Charge d' Affaires for more than a year." 

Mr. Boker accepted the Russian mission in 
1874, and in 1876 Mr. Schuyler was appointed 
Consul-General and Secretary of Legation at 
Constantinople. On his way thither he stopped 
at Belgrade, then in a turmoil of anti-Turkish 
patriotism, and where he saw Prince Milan, 
who, it is now curious to note, impressed him 
as a "very remarkable young man," and 
" singularly intelligent and well-informed." 
Mr. Schuyler adds : 

" He gave me much information about Serbia, and 
in the course of his talk showed me that he was well 
acquainted with America, and followed the march of 
events there better, I fear, than do many Americans 
in Paris." 

The story of Mr. Schuyler's services to hu- 
manity in helping to dispel the cloud discreetly 
thrown by the Disraeli government over the 
atrocities in Bulgaria of Toryism's protege 
the " unspeakable Turk," is too well known to 
need repetition here. To parallel the deeds 
done in that hapless country by the Bashi- 
Bazouks it is necessary to revert to the days 
of Attila or Tamerlane, or, alas ! to more recent 
events in China, over which Christendom would 
fain draw a veil. 

Mr. Schuyler started for Bulgaria on his 
mission of investigation in July, 1876. With 
him went Mr. McGahan of the " Daily News," 
the London paper which deserves honorable 
mention for its disclosure to the British nation 
of the real state of affairs in the Turkish prov- 
inces, and its disproof of Mr. Disraeli's pleas- 
ant theory that the Bashi-Bazouk, so far from 
being the bloody monster depicted by " coffee- 
house babble," sentimental philanthropy, and 
sensational journalism, was, in point of fact, a 
mild and peaceable " Circassian " who was not 
only sweetly incapable of harming anybody, 
but was himself cruelly persecuted by his Bul- 
garian neighbors. Whether Mr. Disraeli was 
deliberately lying, for diplomatic ends, or was 
really persuaded of the truth of the cruel non- 
sense he was uttering, is uncertain ; but it was 



soon made plain to him that England was in 
no mood for fooling, and was determined to 
know the truth about Bulgaria. What that 
truth was, was soon made plain through the 
reports of Mr. Schuyler, and may be gathered 
in its shocking details from the extracts from 
his diary and letters in the present Memoir. 

Of the proceedings of the abortive Confer- 
ence of the Powers at Constantinople which 
followed the disclosure of the facts, as of the 
events in the city during the war which fol- 
lowed the failure of the Conference, the Me- 
moir affords some interesting glimpses. When 
hostilities were virtually over, and the Russians 
were at San Stefano, General Grant arrived 
at Constantinople. Regarding his view of the 
situation Mr. Schuyler says : 

" Grant is very strong in his ideas against the Turks 
and what ought to be done with Turkey . . . Among 
other things the General said : ' Had I been in the posi- 
tion of the Grand Duke Nicholas, I should have re- 
fused to make peace except at Constantinople. The 
occupation of Constantinople for the English fleet 
could not have prevented it would have been an ac- 
complished fact, which the European Powers would 
have bad to treat as best they could. I should have 
insisted on one condition that Turkish rule in Europe 
had forever come to an end.' " 

Mr. Schuyler's Bulgarian revelations had 
not endeared him to the Turks, who, with dip- 
lomatic indirection, soon began complaining of 
him on the score of his too vigorous support of 
his Government's treaty rights in their coun- 
try. A leave of absence was given him, to 
relieve the situation, and he was soon trans- 
ferred to the consulship at Birmingham a 
stop- gap, as it proved, for in 1879 he was 
made Consul- General at Rome, where his posi- 
tion was an agreeable one, despite the refusal 
of the punctilious and venerable Minister, Mr. 
Marsh, to present him at Court, on the ground 
that it " would be derogatory to the dignity of 
the Service to associate the Commercial with 
the Diplomatic branch in social matters." Our 
author adds, " To a man who had been used 
to being on pleasant terms with royalty in 
many countries, this view was unexpected." 
Mr. Schuyler, however, survived this early 
frost, and was soon pleasantly sunning himself 
as usual in the favor of the court circle to 
the scandal, we infer, of the conscientious Mr. 
Marsh. 

In 1880 Mr. Schuyler was transferred to 
Bucarest as Diplomatic Agent and Consul- 
General, and three years later was appointed 
Minister to Greece, Serbia, and Roumania. 
In 1889 he was made Diplomatic Agent at

Cairo, an unfortunate appointment, for the 
Egyptian climate was unsuited to him, and 
soon brought about disorders which proved 
fatal. Mr. Schuyler died, on June 16, 1890, 
at Venice, while on his way to Carlsbad, and 
was buried on the island of San Michele, in 
accordance with his own request. In him his 
country lost a graceful and an accomplished 
man of letters, and a public servant of excep- 
tional fitness for the branch to which his tal- 
ents were devoted. 

Mrs. Sehaeffer's memoir of her brother is 
simply and pleasantly written, and she has in- 
terlarded it freely with extracts from journals 
and letters which are always entertaining and 
sometimes valuable. Of the quality of the 
companion volume we need hardly speak. The 
letters, or essays as they deserve in some cases 
to be called, are in Mr. Schuyler's best vein, 
and everybody knows how agreeably and intel- 
ligently Mr. Schuyler wrote on literary and 
artistic themes. E. G. J. 



OUR IDEA OF TRAGEDY.* 



In the last five years the young play-goer 
and play-reader may well have wondered 
whether in his father's time, or his grand- 
father's, there were brought out any such plays 
as now. Such a one has considered the reso- 
lute and earnest probings of Ibsen ; he has 
appreciated the realism and the romance of 
Hauptmann and Sudermann ; he has been 
able to judge what there might be beyond tem- 
porary sensation in Maeterlinck ; he has seen 
* Cyrano de Bergerac " and " L'Aiglon "; the 
calm beauty of " Herod" makes him anticipate 
the performance with eagerness ; he may have 
but just arisen from the new translation 
of D'Annunzio's " La Citta Morte." Is it 
merely because they are of our own time that 
we hold these plays, these men, great? Prob- 
ably there really is more of the true tragic 
spirit now than there has been for many years. 
It is, then, a good time to speak of Tragedy, 
and there will be not a few readers for Mr. 
Courtney's lectures just published. Mr. Court-

ney says that " in the present age there is no 
particular liking or room for tragedy," but he 
will probably have readers for all that. 

Whether there will be many that will follow 
him contentedly to the end is another matter. 
I cannot, for one thing, take Mr. Pinero's 
" The Second Mrs. Tanqueray " as typical of 
the present idea of tragedy or as earnest of the 
future : Mr. Courtney seems to hold some such 
idea. Now I have just reread the play (between 
the last sentence and this) and that with great 
pleasure, for it is a strong and moving piece 
of work. But I cannot regard it as a great 
tragedy for a reason that is worth noting be- 
cause of its connection with all Mr. Courtney's 
dealing with the subject from -JSschykis down. 
It may seem pedantic at the present moment, 
but I have long been impressed with the keen- 
ness of Aristotle's view of the effect of tragedy 
and that view I have understood rather differ- 
ently from Mr. Courtney. Mr. Courtney 
(pp. 38, 39) believes that Aristotle held that 
tragedy was useful as a purge because the 
spectators, seeing " what fools the tragic char- 
acters made of themselves by indulging in such 
emotions (as pity and fear) left the theatre " 
chastened and humble, realizing that feelings 
are dangerous guides, and emotional displays 
the mark of a feeble nature. Now, I have 
never interpreted the famous passage of Aris- 
totle in that sense, nor, it may be added, have 
I ever felt thus on leaving the theatre. My 
understanding of Aristotle has been that the 
pity and fear roused by tragedy were such 
emotions as purged out of the character (merely 
for the time perhaps) all small and petty fears 
and weaknesses. And when Aristotle said that 
tragedy purged the soul, he meant that the 
soul of any spectator who had seen before him 
the awful agony of Prometheus or CEdipus, 
was, while under the influence of the tragedy, 
purged or cleansed of his own small fears and 
pains. " What are our woes and suff ranee ?" 
as Byron said of Rome. Some such feeling as 
this I have supposed Aristotle had in mind 
when he lectured on the Katharsis, and some 
such feeling I have often had when the curtain 
fell on a tragedy, a species of calmness, of rest, 
after emotional conflict. On the whole Aris- 
totle's doctrine seems a little too confined : he 
held that tragedy purged the mind of its own 
vicious pity and fear. It would seem as though 
it might purge the mind of many another feel- 
ing. But even with the limitation of Aristotle 
one cannot very well adopt the rather narrow 
view of tragedy taken by Mr. Courtney, who, 



188 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



by the way, has very slight regard for the 
Stagirite. 

Mr. Courtney presents the leading idea of 
tragedy as a conflict (p. 43) : the essential 
character of the Greek drama lay in the conflict 
between the human will and fate (p. 43), in 
the Shakespearean drama between man and the 
laws of the universe (p. 70). So far his treat- 
ment is consistent enough, though probably 
not sufficient. But when we come to modern 
tragedy, the idea seems to be different. Mr. 
Courtney says of Ibsen, whom he regards 
rather dubiously, that his idea of tragedy is 
" the failure on the part of a given individual 
to achieve his mission " (p. 124), and he adds 
that this " might be the description of every 
tragedy in the world's history." But this later 
formula does not seem precisely the same as 
that which we had before, though presumably 
not inconsistent with it. Nor, if we return a 
moment to "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray," 
shall we find that it is to be called a tragedy 
(let alone a great one) by this definition or by 
the earlier one. What is it that makes Paula 
Tanqueray a tragic figure ? That her life is a 
conflict ? that she fails to achieve her mission ? 
Not at all : she has no mission, nor is her life 
more of a conflict than is usual. Mr. Courtney 
does not say why she is to be thought of as 
tragic : he says (p. 129), " The character of 
Paula Tanqueray is one of the most triumphant 
creations which has ever been composed for the 
stage," but he does not say why she is to be 
thought of as a tragic figure ; and a careful 
study of his three lectures shows that if we ac- 
cept his views, Mrs. Tanqueray is not what he 
thinks she is. 

My own idea of tragedy is somewhat different 
from Mr. Courtney's. It is, I am sorry to say, 
rather a cloudy, sometimes even a muddled, 
idea, but such as it is, it takes in Mrs. Tan- 
queray better than Mr. Courtney's idea does. 
So I shall try to explain it. 

There is a great deal in the relation of in- 
dividuals to the world in general that appears 
to us very strange. Sometimes things go ex- 
actly right, just as we expect, wish, hope, or 
think or admit they ought to go. There is no 
tragedy in such matters, although these things 
are not always pleasing. Often they are very 
sad. For example, the death of a noble young 
fellow in war is in itself not tragic. It may 
become a tragedy when we think of its effect 
upon his widowed mother whose life had been 
absorbed into him, or upon somebody else. 
But in itself such a death, although one of the 



very sad things of life, is a wholly noble and 
fitting end to a devoted and unselfish life. It 
is not tragic : Mrs. Browning was quite right 
when she spoke of the young Lombard soldier in 
the hospital as " young antipathetic with dying." 
And like such a death is many an event in life 
which we cannot refuse to acknowledge pre- 
cisely what it ought to be, and these events, 
happy or unhappy, we do not call tragic. 

But there are also many events in life, many 
combinations of individual and universe as we 
might say, which we do not understand thor- 
oughly, which appear to us quite incongruous, 
paradoxic, inconsistent, and not at all explain- 
able according to our previous ideas. These 
combinations may be ridiculous when they are 
trivial, may be interesting when they are not 
trivial but still of no great import, may be both 
from different standpoints, and are tragic when 
they concern the great interests of those who 
have our sympathy. Thus QEdipus, to use one 
of Mr. Courtney's examples, is a tragic figure, 
not because free will struggles with fate, but 
because we have here a good man who has un- 
wittingly got into a horrible plight, he has 
done things so horrible that to try to realize 
them makes the heart almost stop beating. And 
why ? No answer : good men ought not be in- 
volved in such difficulties ; we would not even 
wish bad men such luck. And such a spec- 
tacle chills one (much as Aristotle says) : it is 
one of those cases where the human mind says 
to itself that in spite of every precaution, all 
prudence, sagacity, far-seeing wisdom, one 
may fall into horrible evil. And that is 
tragedy, for we cannot say why it should be so. 

Then take Hamlet, to get something typical 
of Shakespeare. Here is a man who has almost 
everything of the best kind given him to begin 
the world with, position, brains, heart ; he 
should be one to make his mark. Instead, he 
finds himself in such a position that he hurries 
along the course of events and is murdered. 
That is tragic, not as being a conflict, not even 
because the man is broken against one of the 
laws of the universe. It is tragic because 
when the conditions are once given we do not 
deny a single step, yet we cannot see why it 
should have happened at all. Granted that 
Hamlet was too weak of will, how did he get 
so ? By too much thinking ? Is not thinking 
the great faculty of man, the thing that raises 
him above the beasts ? Why should too much 
thought put the thinker in the power of the 
circumstances around him ? We do not under- 
stand these things. No one understands 



1901.] 



THE DIAL, 



189 



" Hamlet "; as soon as one understands it, it 
ceases to be tragedy. 

And to come down to Ibsen. Mr. Courtney 
mentions a number of plays, let us take 
44 An Enemy of the People." Is Stockmann a 
tragic figure? Certainly, if conflict be the 
essence of tragedy, for he is always in a con- 
flict. But I fancy no one will finish the play 
with the idea that they have seen a tragedy : 
they have seen a resolute battle between one 
man and a hundred or more ; the man gave as 
good as he got and at the end was ready to go 
on. He is not a tragic figure (although a fine 
one) nor is the play a tragedy. When we 
turn to " A Doll's House," we find something 
different. We have here a conflict, certainly, 
between man and wife : but that is not tragedy, 
we understand that well enough for practical 
purposes ; a brawling house is not tragic. But 
in " A Doll's House " it was an extraordinary 
case, or perhaps it only seemed so because of 
the skill in putting the case. Here were two 
people who might have lived happily, in the 
main that is, with no more disagreement than 
is well enough to accentuate trust and affec- 
tion. And why did they not? Well, the 
world is going on nowadays and people are 
acting under influences that often they do not 
understand. A hundred years ago Nora and 
Thorvald would have understood each other 
well enough. To-day they do not, and we are 
not far enough from them to do much better. 
Therefore, as they are both our friends, they 
are tragic in our sight. There might have 
been happiness, but there was unhappiness. 
Was it by accident ? Could they help it ? Do 
we understand it ? No, to all three. We do 
not understand Nora, and, as Mr. Courtney 
remarks, when interpreted by Duse we under- 
stand her less than ever. 

Such is tragedy always, a pursuing of 
some of the strange and unexplainable courses 
of life. The finer and nobler the actors, the 
greater and more universal the evil which they 
do not escape, the greater the tragedy. This 
is the tragic element in the story of the Due 
de Reichstadt. He is, on the whole, an attrac- 
tive man with a good head and heart and great 
ambitions. People love him : he ought to do 
well. Now he does not do well at all, because 
although he has an immensely daring imagina- 
tion, he has also a besetting triviality that pre- 
vents his ever understanding what it really is 
that he is trying to do. It does not appear 
that he had the remotest comprehension of 
what it meant to be Napoleon Bonaparte. He 



knew that his father had been a glorious con- 
queror, and he knew accurately the uniforms 
of his father's army. But he does not seem to 
have known much more. The figure offers, 
then, one of those incongruities which are 
always painful to us in those who arouse our 
sympathy. In fact, the incongruity is not con- 
fined to the Due de Reichstadt : it is so pain- 
fully apparent to each one of us when we think 
of ourselves and our own ideals, that it cannot 
but have for us an absorbing interest. The idea 
being, therefore, something that absorbs our in- 
terest, and having this characteristic of strange 
unexplainableness about it, we call it tragic. 

So much for an idea of tragedy different 
from Mr. Courtney's. Now for Mrs. Tanqueray, 
who will probably be remembered by many 
who have not Pinero's plays at hand. She is 
not a tragic figure by reason of any conflict 
nor any unfulfilled mission. She is tragic for 
another reason. 

Mrs. Tanqueray was a woman who had come 
to a certain age and had got tired of her life. 
It had not been a happy one ; we may blame 
it or not, that is beside the immediate question : 
there comes a man who loves her and believes 
in her, and she conceives a future very different 
from the past and much happier, and the play 
begins. In the play she finds that she cannot 
get rid of her past ; it comes up against her 
more and more insistently and unbearably, and 
she finally kills herself. What is the tragedy ? 
Merely this : that although we know that she 
could not have turned over a new leaf (gluing 
the old ones down), we are not at all clear as 
to why she could not. It seems as if she should 
have had a chance. Why cannot a woman 
like Paula Tanqueray wipe out the past and 
begin again? First, because the particular 
kind of past that she had cannot be wiped out, 
and second, because no past at all can be wiped 
out. But although we know this well enough 
we do not understand it, and so the particularly 
poignant or general cases make great tragedies. 

The Due de Reichstadt was a peculiarly 
poignant and general case of an incongruity 
of life, poignant because the character has an 
intense personality, and general because his 
case is the case (to some degree) of every 
idealist. Mrs. Tanqueray. on the other hand, 
was neither poignant nor general ; she was 
more the first than the second, but not truly 
either. So the play is not a great play, nor is 
any other play of Pinero's great, for the same 
reason. 

Apply the test, however, to Ibsen's " Ghosts": 



190 



THE DIAL 



[March 16, 



you will find that Mrs. Alving is a figure before 
which the imagination calms and quiets down 
and cools, so as to leave one in that state of 
mental insensibility that comes of pressing a 
question until we find there can be no possible 
answer to it. Or Sudermann's " Heimat." 
The play is not precisely a tragedy because no 
real evil befalls Magda. But it is a tragedy 
as far as concerns her father, not because he 
is a poignant case, but because he is such a 
general one : he is the father who cannot un- 
derstand his child, the burger who cannot un- 
derstand the world outside the city wall, the 
man of the past who cannot understand the 
present. Or Hauptmann : Hannele is a bet- 
ter instance than Heinrich in "The Sunken 
Bell "; Hannele, for whom the world is too 
brutal and who dies in a fantastic reminiscence 
of past imaginings. Rostand we have already 
tested : Cyrano would have done as well as the 
Due de Reichstadt. Cyrano is a perfectly 
general type, the person who does not get his 
due (i. e., every one of us), but he is also a 
personality. Maeterlinck I must leave out 
because it seems almost a piece of folly to 
speak of not understanding the action pre- 
sented in his plays. He surrounds his char- 
acters with such elements of mystery that it 
would be an exaggeration to say that we truly 
understood anything about them. That is why 
they are all ridiculous to some people, tragic 
to others. 

Mr. Courtney, then, might have found mod- 
ern dramatists who illustrated the idea of 
tragedy better than Pinero. It must be re- 
membered that he does speak of Maeterlinck 
and Ibsen, and also that he delivered these 
lectures before the appearance of " L'Aiglon." 
Also before Mr. Arthur Symons had translated 
" La Citta Morte " and before Mr. Stephen 
Phillips had presented " Herod." 

I have left myself too little space for these 
very interesting books. Of D'Annunzio's play, 
undoubtedly a powerful and emotional piece, 
it must be enough to confess that to its intoxi- 
cated, rarified, isolated atmosphere my criterion 
of the tragic has about as much relation as an 
ordinary foot-rule. In a certain way, perhaps, 
we might speak of it, but it would take too 
much explanation. " Herod," on the other 
hand, offers a somewhat better illustration. 
Herod is a man of ambition and of action, a 
man quite able to deal easily with every com- 
bination of the involved politics of his time. 
He is definite and direct, perfectly self-confi- 
dent, perfectly adaptable to each new necessity, 



never unready, and therefore powerful. But 
he is in love with Mariamne, and so much in 
love with her that she is more important to 
him than anything else. That in itself is a 
tragic situation and one that nobody can un- 
derstand. But in the case of Herod, the situa- 
tion is further intensified by his own misap- 
prehension. He is keen-sighted in politics but 
not with women. He does not seem clearly to 
understand whether he loves Mariamne better 
or his power ; he certainly does not rightly 
understand her. With his absolute self-confi- 
dence he cannot see how a plan of his can go 
astray. Therefore he orders the death of 
Mariamne's brother. Mariamne finds him out 
and hates him. He is tricked into ordering 
her death, and then he finds out how much he 
loved her. All this is presented in very beau- 
tiful classic verse and the effect is very strong. 
Incongruity, paradox, inconsistency, and yet 
such as we cannot deny when we grant the 
facts at bottom, and so a tragedy. Whether 
a great tragedy or not will depend ultimately 
upon the breadth of the motive, the wideness 
of the general appeal. The play has the pre- 
serving power of style, but of course something 
more is needed for immortality.

THE CHURCH ix THE PHILIPPINES.* 

It has been one of the greatest of misfor- 
tunes for both the United States and the Phil- 
ippines that their relations should have drifted 
into the bubbling chaldron of American poli- 
tics, making misrepresentation the rule and 
not the exception, and rational knowledge and 
investigation a practical impossibility. But 
an equal misfortune is promised in the possi- 
bility of a sectarian aspect being given to the 
question through the attitude of the Filipinos 
toward the Friars of their islands and the atti- 
tude of the American government toward the 
Friars. The question is a delicate and some- 
what complicated one, but its details are so 
little a matter of public knowledge that the 
recent books by Messrs. Sawyer and Robinson 
deserve especial attention from the light they 
throw on it and the excuse they give for dwelling 
on that phase of the general topic at this time.

resident in Luzon for the last fourteen years, 
and a traveller from time to time through the 
archipelago. He is in keen sympathy with the 
Americans in their general design of bringing 
the islands under their control, though sharply 
critical of the methods they have used up to 
this time. Mr. Albert G. Robinson was the 
efficient correspondent of the New York 
"Evening Post " in the islands from July, 
1899, to February, 1900, and his volume is 
made up for the most part of letters sent dur- 
ing that time to his paper, revised in the light 
of the latest information within his possession. 
To the seeker after truth both volumes are in- 
valuable ; to the partisan anxious only to con- 
ceal facts they will, it is to be feared, prove 
unwelcome, so certain is it that the taint of 
Europeanism and imperialism brings distrust 
of enlightenment. 

It has been pointed out before that the treaty 
of Paris, while it settled no question of human 
rights, devoted Articles VIII. and IX. to 
maintaining the property and other material 
rights of the religious orders in the Philippines. 
Mr. Sawyer believes the Americans to have 
been imposed upon in $is regard, and it is 
certain that the advice of Mr. John Foreman 
concerning the matter was deliberately rejected. 
" As soon as the effect of the treaty was 
known," Mr. Sawyer adds, " Archbishop 
Nozaleda, who had fled to China from the ven- 
geance he feared, returned to Manila. He 
seemed to have a good deal of interest with 
General Otis, and this did not please the na- 
tives, nor inspire them with confidence." 
When it is realized that this prelate was held 
responsible by the Filipinos for the enormi- 
ties of the 1896 massacres, including the mar- 
tyrdom of Jose Rizal, it is apparent that a 
mistake has been made from the point of view 
of everyone except the Friars, of whom the 
Archbishop, himself a Dominican, is the rep- 
resentative. 

For in the Philippines, as in Cuba and 
Porto Rico, the natives, though devoted sons 
of the Church, are not pledged to any admi- 
ration for the Friars or the Spanish clergy 
generally. Their uniform ambition has been 
to have clergymen of their own race, secular 
priests, not religious. It is a matter of com- 
mon knowledge that the evils which run in the 
train of benefieed Friars were one of the prin- 
cipal causes of the Lutheran Reformation, and 
that the Church recognized the justness of the 
universal complaints in the Council of Trent 
by forbidding Friars to hold benefices. Un- 



fortunately the Philippines, like the United 
States, are in partibus infidelium, and in them 
the decrees of the Tridentine Council do not 
run. The complaints of Europe in Luther's 
time are the complaints of the Filipinos to-day. 
They are devoted to their native priests, and 
their revolt is not against the faith but the dis- 
cipline of the Church, nor are they open to 
criticism from Roman sources any more than 
those wise ecclesiastics who sought to do away 
with such abuses by forbidding Friars from 
benefices at Trent in the sixteenth century. 
Against these abuses the Tagals arose again 
and again, laying down thousands of their lives 
to be free. Yet it is with the Friars that the 
American government has allied itself, and it 
is with them its army and navy is acting at the 
present time, as its policy has been dictated 
by them since the occupation of Manila, par- 
ticularly since the return of Archbishop Noza- 
leda upon the signing of the treaty at which 
Filipino representation was forbidden. It is 
this that causes Mr. Sawyer to exclaim : 

" More important still was it to take care that the 
Tagal insurrection should not have been in vain. That 
rebellion probably cost fifty thousand human lives, im- 
mense loss of property, and untold misery. It was 
fought against the Friars and was at last triumphant. 
The Spanish Friars had been expelled and their lands 
confiscated. Were the Americans to bring them back 
and guarantee them in peaceable possession, once more 
riveting on the chain the Tagals had torn off ? This 
seems to have been General Otis's intention. I think 
he might have stood npon the accomplished fact. But 
he did not." (The italics are ours.) 

When Mr. Sawyer comes to sum up the 
blunders of the Peace Commission he sets them 
down as follows : 

"1. They took General Merritt's opinion that the 
Tagals would submit, and accepted Mr. Foreman's 
assurance of Tagal plasticity and accommodating nature. 

"2. They disregarded the intimation of Don Felipe 
Agoncillo, the accredited agent of the Tagals, that 
these would accept no settlement to which they were 
not parties. 

" 3. They treated several millions of civilized Chris- 
tian people like a herd of cattle to be purchased with 
the ranch. 

"4. Under Article VIII., they guaranteed the re- 
ligious orders the possession of estates already taken 
from them. 

"5. Under Article IX., they gave the expelled friars 
the right to return and exercise their profession." 

Concerning the abuses of the Friars, it will, 
perhaps, clear up the situation if the reader 
consult the pages of Mr. John Foreman's book, 
remembering that Mr. Foreman is himself 
a devout son of the Church, or such extracts 
from it as are given by Mr. Herbert Welsh 
in his " The Other Man's Country " (Lippin-

cott, 1900), or in Mr. Dean C. Worcester's 
" The Philippine Islands " (pp. 343 et seq*). 

Mr. Robinson is not so explicit, but his 
meaning is not open to doubt when he says : 

" I do not care to go into details concerning the 
charges of gross immorality, wrong, and oppression, 
that are brought against the Orders as organized bodies 
and against the members of the orders as individuals, 
from the archbishop [Nozaleda] downward. The 
charges are brought openly, and there can be no ques- 
tion that many of them are capable of the fullest sub- 
stantiation." 

He then enters into a consideration of the 
advent of the Most Reverend Placide Louis 
Chapelle, archbishop of New Orleans, at once 
the apostolic delegate of His Holiness Pope 
Leo XIII. and the commissioner of President 
McKinley. He arrived in Manila. A public 
reception in the nature of an official welcome 
was given him by Archbishop Nozaleda at 
which the American authorities, military and 
civil, were the principal attendants. Soon after 
El Progreso, the newspaper leading the at- 
tack upon the Friars, published an interview 
with him, never denied up to this time, in which 
Archbishop Chapelle was quoted as saying (the 
translation is Mr. Robinson's) : 

" The four public lectures given by Father McKin- 
non caused President McKinley to realize the necessity 
for the monastic orders remaining in the Philippines. 
I come to Manila with ample authority for everything. 
The friars of the Philippines have alarmed themselves 
without any reason. I know their importance and am 
openly predisposed in their favor. If the friars occupy 
the parishes they will be considered as elements of 
order and therefore as American agents." 

That the Friars are in the saddle may be 
read in an authorized interview with Arch- 
bishop Chappelle, published as a special dis- 
patch to the Chicago " Tribune " on March 4, 
1901, in which he is quoted as saying (the 
italics are ours): 

" First, I came here to reorganize Church affairs on 
American lines, and to place her in a position similar 
to the one she holds in the United States. 

"Second, to accomplish this I will do my utmost to 
bring American priests here as soon as possible, and the 
friars will not oppose them. On the contrary, they will be 
pleased if a goodly number come, and they promise to do 
everything towards their maintenance and their instruc- 
tion in the character and needs of the Filipinos." 

It is, therefore, doubly certain that, since 
Archbishop Chapelle's coming to the islands of 
the East the Friars, returning in great num- 
bers from the surrounding countries to which 
the Filipinos had driven them, have been dic- 
tating the policy there of both church and state, 
of both Leo XIII. and William McKinley. 
This is the more to be remarked, because 



this same prelate had previously been the apos- 
tolic delegate to Cuba and Porto Rico, where 
all his influence had been used in favor of the 
insular as distinguished from the peninsular 
clergy, leaving those islands of the West fairly 
in the hands of their native secular priests and 
in the way of becoming fully so, with the Span- 
iards returning to Europe and freedom but- 
tressed by just that much the opposite in every 
particular of his procedure and its results in 
the unhappy Philippines. Tyranny loves com- 
pany the world over ; but who could predict 
that the Stars and Stripes would ever march 
to the tune of the Spanish Inquisition ?

THE EARLY POEMS OF TENNYSON.* 

Mr. John Churton Collins has recently ed- 
ited the early poems of Tennyson with the pur- 
pose of giving all their variant readings. He 
understands by the early poems, the editions 
of 1830, 1833, 1842, the prize poem Tim- 
buctoo," 1827, and a few scattering pieces, one 
or two of which appeared as late as 1851. Of 
his work he speaks in the Preface with charm- 
ing modesty : 

" I must, I fear, claim the indulgence due to one who 
attempts, for the first time, a critical edition so per- 
plexingly voluminous in variants as Tennyson's. I can 
only say I have spared neither time nor labour to be 
accurate and exhaustive. ... I am not conscious that 
I have left any variant unrecorded, but I should not 
like to assert that this is the case." 

Mr. Collins is wrong (and this is a remark- 
able oversight) when he says that " attempts 
for the first time " as the Cambridge Tennyson 
(reviewed in THE DIAL December 16, 1898) 
was the pioneer in this field. The Bibliography 
is good, though by no means entirely correct 
or complete. As was pointed out in a com- 
munication to THE DIAL, May 16, 1899, no 
Tennyson bibliography yet published is free 
from errors and numerous omissions. 

As to the variants, the editor has done his 
work quite well. No one who has not com- 
pared texts with the purpose of noting every 
variation however trifling can have any idea 
how onerous the task is, and how many things 
provokingly remain unseen after one has looked 
long. While, however, the work has been done

well, it has not been done perfectly. I have 
noted about seventy-five errors, and it is not 
likely I have found them all. This is a small 
number, especially considering the fact, alluded 
to in the Preface, that a part of the work was 
done by assistants ; the wonder is that, under 
these circumstances, it is not very much larger. 

While these errors are for the most part 
very slight, none of them are failures to record 
variant spelling. Indeed, I am unable to see 
why variant spelling in a modern author should 
be recorded. I am well aware that a final e in 
Chaucer is important, but it seems to me quite 
insignificant whether Tennyson writes though 
or tho\ gray or grey, through or thro\ In 
these cases neither the meaning nor the rhythm 
nor the rhyme can be in any way affected. But 
for some reason Mr. Collins's notes contain a 
host of variant spellings. The fact that he has 
culled so many might convey the impression 
that he has gathered them all or nearly all and 
that we have almost a facsimile of the early 
texts. This would be a wrong impression. 
While I have not counted the cases, I do not 
think he has given one-fifth of the orthograph- 
ical variants. But I still do not see why he 
should have taken the trouble to give any. 

Like most books this one has its limitations, 
but these should not blind us to our obligation 
to Mr. Collins, for only after several such at- 
tempts as his can a definitive text of the poet be 
made. It is to be hoped that he will some 
time give us the variant readings of all Tenny- 
son's poems. ALBERT E. JACK. 



BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS. 

" This is the first attempt made in 
any language, including Chinese, to 
produce a history of Chinese litera- 
ture." With this striking statement Professor Her- 
bert A. Giles introduces his " History of Chinese 
Literature " ( Appleton), being the tenth Volume in 
the series of " Literatures of the World." Criticism 
in the sense of correction or dissent is made dumb 
by such a fact as this ; we must place ourselves un- 
reservedly in the hands of the author, and trust 
implicitly in the accuracy of his scholarship. It is, 
however, permissible to express an opinion concern- 
ing the interest of his subject and of his book, and 
we may say without hesitation that both interests 
are great, the latter greater than we had supposed 
possible, and the former marked bv the admirable 
qualities of the author's style. His manner of 
writing is such as to compel attention, being lucid, 
forceful, and penetrated with a shrewd wisdom that 



sometimes takes the form of a dry but delightful 
humor. What could be happier than this conclu- 
sion of the argument concerning the origin of the 
Chinese people ? " No one seems to think they can 
possibly have originated in the fertile plains where 
they are now found." Or than this comment upon 
the fabled calendar trees ? " But civilization proved 
unfavorable to their growth, and the species became 
extinct." One cannot examine this treatise without 
a feeling of heightened respect for the people with 
whose writings it deals. Here is a literature that 
has an unbroken record of twenty-five centuries ; 
here is a civilization that for at least as long a 
period has known the uses of such things as silk 
garments, leather shoes, pottery, and umbrellas. 
These facts belong to a strictly historical chronol- 
ogy, but we are further reminded that the Chinese 
themselves pretend to account for the world for 
much longer than that to be exact, for the space 
of 2,269,381 years. How pitifully young and raw 
our Western civilizations and histories must appear 
when contrasted, not merely with the claims, but 
with the undisputed facts of Chinese history and 
civilization. Since Mr. Giles has worked in virgin 
soil, as far as Western readers and critics are con- 
cerned, he has done well to depart from the plan 
of the series for which his book was written, by 
giving a large proportion of his pages to extracts 
from the Chinese classics. His translations of these 
passages are so charming that his book is at once a 
history and a florilegium, and in the latter aspect, 
as delightful a book as is often seen. 

There are two kinds of anthologies, 
which may be called subjective and 
objective. In the first kind, the 
compiler chiefly consults his own tastes and inter- 
ests, and leaves unconsidered the important ques- 
tion of how far his tastes and interests coincide 
with those which characterize the enlightened judg- 
ment of the race. In the other kind, the compiler 
has regard to tradition and authority, is careful of 
his perspective, and subordinates his personal incli- 
nations to the collective verdict of cumulative criti- 
cism. For English poetry, Mr. Palgrave's " Golden 
Treasury" is the perfect bouquet of anthological 
effort, although in this case, so admirable was the 
taste of the editor, there seems to have been slight 
need of any subordination of personal preference 
to the consensus of critical opinion. Of anthologies 
on a larger scale, the two of Mr. S ted man are prob- 
ably the best that have been made, although their 
restriction to the verse of a single century and 
that the latest has rendered certainty of judg- 
ment exceedingly difficult. Mr. A. T. Quiller- 
Couch is the latest of English anthologists, and the 
"Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250-1900" 
(Oxford University Press), as edited by him, gives 
us upwards of a thousand pages of the best of our 
poetry. Let it be said, however, once for all, that 
this is one of the subjective anthologies. The editor 
has put in the things that he likes, and that is the

whole story. His preface is an implied confession 
of this method, and goes on to tell us in explicit 
terms how he has modified his spellings, chosen the 
readings that he prefers over those which have the 
best authority, and even excised from famous poems 
the stanzas that do not appeal to his personal sym- 
pathies. All this being admitted, there is little to 
say, for nothing is more futile than to criticize an 
anthology compiled upon such a plan. The proper 
perspective is lacking, the choice is often capricious, 
and even the texts are not free from rather glaring 
mistakes. Mr. Quiller-Couch is an excellent novel- 
ist and a charming writer in other departments of 
literature, but he has never given evidence of criti- 
cal acumen, and his browsings in this field have 
always been those of an impressionist. An " Ox- 
ford " anthology ought to speak with a voice of 
special authority, but the voice of this book is one 
of which no intelligent reader need take much heed. 
It is a book of good poetry ; but there are thousands 
of readers who could have compiled books equally 
good, and probably scores who could have done 
better. 



A critic as 
dramatist. 



A commonplace of current criticism 
is the difference between the creative 
faculty and the critical. One who 
had more or less to say on the subject, Matthew 
Arnold, is himself a fair illustration of the differ- 
ence. His prose was his best work : his poetry, 
though of immense charm for many minds, was 
excellent largely because it recognized its own 
critical character. Of creative energy Matthew 
Arnold in his earlier days undoubtedly had a 
measure, but it was swallowed up in his critical 
intelligence. Something of the sort, Lowell used 
to think, was the case with himself. The reverse 
process is less usual. We do not often find one 
who has given his mind up to critical problems, 
develope strong creative power. There are cases, 
Mr. Henry James, for instance, where a man's 
mind developes both faculties together. But when 
a man has been long devoted to thinking out a 
system of art or literature, he is rarely able at the 
end of it to display powerful creative force. Thus 
Ruskin, although he had something of an artist's 
education, never developed the artist's power. The 
critical habit seems to limit and constrain. All 
this is apropos to Mr. G. L. Raymond's " The Aztec 
God and Other Dramas" (Putnam). Professor 
Raymond is already well-known by a series of vol- 
umes presenting an extensive and careful theory of 
artistic effort and result. His mind has long been 
occupied in weighing and considering causes and 
effects, in the effort to discern the true generaliza- 
tion lurking in myriads of facts. Now with plenty 
of ideas, he turns to the drama, but here his mind 
refuses to embody his thought in forms quite dif- 
ferent from those which have been familiar to it. 
His thought, unconsciously to himself doubtless, 
takes some of the conventional forms which are, in 
a way, generalizations. Thus his dramas fail to 



have vitality, original strength. We must add to 
that, Mr. Raymond does not seem to have the poet's 
imagination. What he has to say he says rather 
plainly without the fulness and richness that we need 
to give us what we think of as poetic pleasure. 
Further we must say that he does not seem to us to 
have a clear idea of the possibilities of the dramatic 
form : the drama, if we recollect rightly, is the one 
form of art of which his system of aesthetics says 
little. At any rate, in an age familiar with Swin- 
burne and Stephen Phillips, or even John Davidson 
and Michael Field, his dramas lack the interest 
which comes of fresh, original effort given to the 
solution of old problems. 

An eccentric Professor William Knight, of Glas- 

phiiosopher and gow University, has collected in a 
his correspondence. come i y? moderate-sized volume, en- 
titled " Lord Monboddo and Some of his Contem- 
poraries " (Dutton), the "philosophical correspon- 
dence" of this learned and eccentric Scotch judge 
with certain distinguished men of his time, with 
whom he was accustomed to discuss his then novel 
theories of language and the origin of man. Of 
the forty-seven letters to and from Lord Monboddo 
given in the volume only two have been previously 
published, and the collection is undoubtedly of con- 
siderable value in so far as it serves to illustrate the 
philosophical attitude of the writers and of reflec- 
tive men of their time generally toward the theories 
discussed. To the correspondence the editor has 
prefixed a brief biographical sketch of Lord Mon- 
boddo, together with a chapter on his philosophical 
position. Dr. Johnson, it will be remembered, said 
to Boswell during the famous Tour that he would 
gladly " go two miles out of his way to see Lord 
Monboddo " who was certainly worth the devia- 
tion, although the miles were Scotch ones. Lord 
Monboddo's views, shocking to his contemporaries, 
as to man's descent from caudate progenitors of 
the orang-outang order, do not seem so very eccen- 
tric nowadays. The letters in the present volume 
are elaborate, essay-like productions, such as nobody 
would think of writing nowadays. Among Lord 
Monboddo's correspondents were Dugald Stewart, 
Samuel Horsley, James Harris, Sir William Jones, 
Sir George Baker. There are several portraits. 



- that the much-discussed "An 

"Englishwoman's Englishwoman's Love-Letters " 
Love-Letier*." (Doubleday) are known to be fiction, 
the book can be read and criticised without the wear- 
isome speculation which has grown around it. Were 
the letters really written by a woman ? How could 
such intimate letters have been published ? What 
could possibly have been the reason the affair was 
broken off ? Such questions were entirely aside 
from the literary aspects of the matter, and may 
now be forgotten. We know that the book is a 
piece of fiction. We know that it is needless to 
know why the affair was broken off. The book

its last part is chiefly of interest to us as a good 
example of that preoccupation with the processes 
of the soul that distinguished the latter part of the 
nineteenth century. One can hardly do more to 
appreciate the literary position of the hook than to 
think how Sir Walter Scott would have been out- 
raged by it. Scott never, so far as we remember, 
dealt with any such case ; he would probably never 
have invented such a brutal story. But the case of 
the " Bride of Lammermoor " is something of a 
parallel so far as fulness of joy and fulness of 
misery are concerned. Scott told the story, but he 
never sought to examine Lucy Ashton's heart. 
Examination of the human heart, however, is a 
thing that the present day rather enjoys. And the 
chief interest in this book is that it enables us to 
follow almost from day to day the rise of joy in a. 
woman's breast, and its general turning to absolute 
misery. Such was the case with many readers who 
imagined the letters to be genuine ; such is the case 
when we read it as fiction. Its interest is in the 
painful tracing of heart-failure. For our own part 
this seems to us not a very excellent amusement. 
We should prefer, along with the heart-failure, some 
of the wider relations of life, some of the matters 
which would constitute something more of a balance 
according to the usual course of existence. Here 
probably is the value, such as it is, of the discussion 
of the reasons for it all. With some reasons the 
book gains in dignity ; with others it rather falls. 
It was perhaps wise for the author to leave us in 
the dark. 

The layman in biblical study has 
for the* future. shown slight interest in Messianic 

prophecy. This has been due (1) 
to the general obscurity of the subject and (2) to 
the lack of any adequate popular discussion of the 
theme. Professor G. S. Goodspeed's " Israel's 
Messianic Hope : ' (Macmillan) is intended to dis- 
sipate both of these difficulties. It is intended 
primarily for the reader of the English Bible. For 
this reason technical questions in criticism and ex- 
egesis and Hebrew and Greek words are avoided. 
But not to neglect the advanced student, the author 
has provided liberal references to the best new lit- 
erature on the subject, and has added to the volume 
a selected bibliography. Now the method of Pro- 
fessor Goodspeed is just that which will appeal to 
the popular reader. He has adopted, in preference 
to the so-called " fulfilment " or " theological " 
method, the historical plan of treatment. That is, 
he " takes up the ancient Hebrew literature from 
the point of view of the historical origin and en- 
vironment of its various writings. The history is 
studied from the Hebrew side ; the ideas are inves- 
tigated as they grow out of the history, and are 
modified or conditioned by it. The question asked 
is, not so much, What did this statement mean to 
the Christian Church? but, What did it mean to 
him who first uttered it, and to those by whom it 
was first heard or read? " This method cannot but 



commend itself to every student of history. Its 
application to the treatment of this difficult subject 
is both sane and commendable. The author has 
quoted in the language of the Revised Version large 
portions of the text of the prophecies termed Mes- 
sianic, and has added thereto his luminous inter- 
pretation of the same. The discriminating scholar- 
ship, the fitting proportions, and the sanity of 
interpretation give this book a prominent place 
among the works on biblical theology. 

Popular interest in mushrooms, for 
muthwrm book. Dotn scientific and practical reasons, 

has grown considerably of recent 
years, and the latest contribution to the literature 
of this subject will be sure to find a receptive audi- 
ence. Miss Nina L. Marshall is the author of 
"The Mushroom Book" now before us, which is 
published by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. in 
their nature study series, which already contains 
books on butterflies, birds, and flowers. The special 
feature of all these books is that, although they are 
richly illustrated, they are sold at a very moderate 
price. The colored plates alone, twenty-four in 
number, would justify the price set upon the book, 
to say nothing of the numerous plates in black-and- 
white, the still more numerous cuts in the text, and 
the text itself. The book may be recommended 
as a safe guide for the identification of species by 
amateurs who have only a smattering of botanical 
method. The descriptions are accurate, and not 
more technical than is absolutely necessary. There 
are also directions for collecting and preserving 
specimens, and for cooking them as well which 
consideration will perhaps go farther than any other 
toward finding purchasers for the volume. It offers 
what is practically an equivalent of Hamilton Gib- 
son's work for a small fraction of its price. We 
need say no more than this to lovers of mushrooms, 
whether as articles of food or as objects of scientific 
study. 

Two volumes come together in the 
tooroiume.** Mediaeval Towns" series (Dent- 

Oiffn I'm fnn 111 ii. .. 

Macmillan), one dealing with Flor- 
ence and one with Constantinople. Tho former is 
done with loving care by Mr. Edmund G. Gardner, 
who combines the various artistic forces of the 
Florentine Republic in his pages in such a way as 
to give it a really fine literary flavor. All the 
glories of poetry, painting, sculpture, and architec- 
ture that made the city splendid to the eye and ear 
and understanding speak again through his pages, 
an achievement by no means unique, the city hav- 
ing the gift of inspiring its modern chroniclers to 
an unusual degree. The history of this flower of 
the renaissance before the day of Dante is dismissed 
in a single chapter, and the story of the government 
carried down to the great Duke Cosimo. This, with 
a consideration of the Florentine people, suffices 
for the more formal history, the other portions of 
the book taking up the geographical divisions of 
Florence, and combining all their interests in a nar-

rative which serves as a guide-book through its par- 
ticularity, and as an account for instruction and 
amusement as well. A number of pictures from 
the hand of Miss Nellie Erichsen are included, and 
with these are several reproductions of old engrav- 
ings of the town and its distinctive features. The 
work on Constantinople has been done by the Rev. 
William Holden Hutton, and its interest is made 
classic in a degree. Though not so large a book as 
the other, it covers more space, the opening chapter 
alone carrying the story from old Byzantium to the 
Turks. In the subsequent divisions of the book, 
dealing, as in the former case, with geographical 
portions of the ancient seat of empire, the interest 
is divided between the Christian and Moslem relics, 
with a natural leaning toward the older Greek 
rather than the newer Turk, the churches rather 
than the mosques. A final chapter deals with the 
pre-Christian life of the city as shown in architec- 
tural and other relics, and is by no means tbe least 
readable of the seven. 



Not a romance, though a tenuous 
love 8toi 7 ris . es almost to the surface 
now and again through the book, not 
a novel, though there are developments which al- 
most make it one in successive pages, Dr. S. Weir 
Mitchell's " Dr. North and His Friends " (Century 
Co.) is none the less interesting because it is diffi- 
cult of classification. In its book form it is con- 
siderably larger than in its appearance as a serial, 
and the increase in size is due mainly to the inser- 
tion of a number of anecdotes of men and things, 
which have all the charm of an acquaintance with 
the people of whom they speak. It may be sur- 
mised, reasonably enough, that they are the very 
cream of Dr. Mitchell's common- place book. Taken 
as a whole the story outlines the life of such 
Americans as all of us would like to be, did culti- 
vation and wealth admit of it, and the pleasant 
company certainly sets a social ideal to which it 
would be well for Americans to conform. Yet it 
is with something of a shock that the reader comes 
to realize at the close of the narrative that a com- 
plete vulgarian has fairly forced the doors of this 
gentle and cultured society, all his too evident limi- 
tations, moral and social, being pardoned him in 
view of his great wealth, ill-gotten though it is. 
That Dr. Mitchell is well within the truth in giving 
such an ending to such an episode does not make 
it any better reading, and we wish he had contrived 
to maintain its own ideals throughout the book. 



Religion in 
the Jorecattle. 



Mr. Frank T. Bullen, for literalness 
the best sea writer since Dana, is 
industriously making hay while the 
sun of his popularity shines. He now adds to the 
growing series of volumes reflecting the incidents 
of his seafaring career, a little book entitled " With 
Christ at Sea " (Stokes), and defined as " a personal 
record of religious experiences on board ship for 
fifteen years." An account of religion in the fo'c's'le 



might, one would think, be almost as brief as the 
famous chapter on snakes in Iceland. But on Mr. 
Bullen's showing it seems clear that the name of 
his Maker is not used by " poor Jack " solely as a 
profane expletive and to the sorrow of the traditi- 
onal " cherub who sits up aloft " and " looks out 
for " his ghostly interests. Mr. Bullen writes simply 
and earnestly, and his account of the artless piety 
of some of his erstwhile shipmates, and of their 
efforts to stem the tide of brutality, profanity, and 
debauchery by which the sailorman is commonly 
swept to moral and physical destruction, is touch- 
ing and interesting. The sailor, for all his outer 
roughness, and proneness to coarse indulgence, is 
commonly an emotional man, easily touched by 
fervent appeal, and far more open than the sophis- 
ticated landsman, to the methods of revivalism. 
That these methods make for good, and even per- 
manent good, in many cases, and are in fact the 
only methods by which the religious sense of large 
classes of men can be stirred, is certain. That a 
most promising and relatively neglected field for 
their trial is offered in every seaport town seems 
to us the practical moral of Mr. Bullen's book. 
We are not going to impugn the conduct or the 
wisdom of the battalions of Christian missionaries 
who go abroad annually with the view of persuading 
men to change their religions ; but we do think a 
larger proportion of them might well halt at the 
seaboard in the interests of men, nominally Chris-, 
tian, who have in fact no religion at all. Mr. Bul- 
len's book is graphic and well-written, and shows 
an unfamiliar side of seafaring life and character.

A little love story runs through the four chapters,

the seasons, and there is an old English peasant 
named Griggs who makes the American doubly 
grateful for the lack of such human cattle over

tween the insipidity of Plnmptre and the uncouth 
literality of Browning. His text is not exactly easy 
reading, but it is no more difficult than it must be, 
if anything of the JEschylean spirit is to be pre- 
served. We have received this work in two editions, 
one from Mr. George Allen of London, and the 
other from Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., who 
supply the trade in this country. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Six volumes have now appeared iu the " Warwick 
Library," each devoted to the illustration of some par- 
ticular literary form in the history of English letters. 
Mr. Oliphant Smeatou's " English Satires " (Imported 
by Scribner) is the new volume of this series, and sup- 
plies examples all the way from the author of " Piers 
Plowman " down to C. S. C. The introduction, as is 
customary in this collection of volumes, is an elaborate 
essay upon the history of the form under consideration, 
and sets forth the gradual declination of the satirical 
species from its Roman position as one of the cardinal 
divisions of literary composition to the modern view 
which holds it to be rather a " quality of style " than 
one of the prime forms of expression. 

We have been reading a good deal about Milton of 
late years. Besides the volumes in the various series, 
we have had Professor Corson's learned disquisitions, 
and Professor Trent's eloquent critical tribute, and now 
we have also Professor Walter Raleigh's " Milton " 
(Putnam). Mr. Raleigh always writes with distinction, 
and is at the same time one of the sanest and most 
finely-tempered of our living critics. His book is 
an elaborate essay upon the life of Milton, his circum- 
stances, his intellectual equipment, the technique and 
machinery of his writings, and his influence upon pos- 
terity. It cannot be a work of supererogation to pro- 
duce as good a book as this upon Milton or any other 
subject, and we are glad to add it to our collection of 
critical monographs. 

The third volume of the translation of Blok's " His- 
tory of the People of the Netherlands " (Putnam) 
covers the period of the war with Spain from 1559 to 
1621, comprising all of Volume III. and one-half of 
Volume IV. of the original. The book leaves evidence 
of the same scholarly treatment which characterized the 
preceding volumes, and by its numerous footnotes, and 
appended bibliography, attests the extended research 
of its author. The period is a favorite one for histo- 
rians, and one for which polemics are proverbial, but 
Mr. Blok has carefully avoided such writing. In this 
volume there is a greater fulness of political conditions, 
as compared with social or economic development, than 
in the previous volumes, but this is justified by the politi- 
cal importance of the epoch, and in no way sacrifices the 
essential feature, the history of the growth of the people, 
to which the author pledged himself in the first volume.

THE DIAL takes pleasure in presenting herewith its 
annual list of books announced for Spring publication,

necessary exceptions, books recently issued which have

up of a series of articles prepared by an expert hand 
for the London " Times," and printed in that newspaper 
during the past year. 

Mary Hewitt's popular account of " The Queens of 
England," revised by Miss Geneva Armstrong, and 
brought down to the close of the reign of Victoria, is 
published by Messrs. B. S. Wasson & Co., Chicago, in 
an illustrated volume. 

Lord Rosebery's rectorial address at Glasgow on 
Questions of Empire " and Mr. Joseph H. Choate r s 
Edinburgh address on " Abraham Lincoln" are two 
additions, particularly timely and acceptable, to the 
familiar series of white-covered booklets published by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

A little anthology of " Selections from the Southern 
Poets," prepared by Mr. William Lander Weber, is 
published by the Macmillan Co. in their " Pocket En- 
glish Classics " series. Though intended primarily for 
class-room use, the collection is one that all poetry- 
lovers will be glad to have. 

" The Religious Spirit in the Poets " (Crowell), by 
the Bishop of Ripon, is a collection of twelve rather 
discursive chapters upon Spenser and Marlowe, Shake- 
speare and Milton, Browning and Tennyson, and cer- 
tain other poets. Dr. Carpenter confesses that the book 
is a product of his railway journeyings, and it bears the 
marks of desultory activity that we might expect. The 
result is a kindly popular book, which can have no pre-

tense to critical weight, but for which there no doubt 
exists a middle-class audience ready to applaud and 
feel genuinely grateful for the teachings offered. 

Mr. Irving Bacheller's new romance, " D'ri and I," 
will be issued by the Lothrop Publishing Company in 
September. The scene of the story is laid in the North 
Country. For the past two months Mr. Bacheller's 
" Eben Holden " has led the list of best-selling books 
of the country, and the 250th thousand is just from 
the press. 

Mrs. Max Miiller has undertaken to prepare a life of 
her husband, the late Professor F. Max Miiller, and 
would be much indebted to Professor Miiller's corres- 
pondents if they would lend her any letters they may 
have in their possession. They should be sent to Mrs. 
Max Miiller, at 7 Norham Gardens, Oxford, England. 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. will be the publishers 
of the Life. 

Mr. Edward Martin Moore has collected, and printed 
at the Blue Sky Press, the best of the tributes in verse 
that have been addressed to Omar since the flourishing 
of the cult, and called the collection " Spoil of the 
North Wind," a title suggested by the familar anecdote 
of what Omar replied when asked where his tomb 
should be. It makes a very pretty book, and all 
Omarians will be sure to want it. Since the edition is 
limited, it will be well to put in early applications. 

The fourth edition of " A Dictionary of American 
Authors," by Mr. Oscar Fay Adams, has just been pub- 
lished by Messrs. Houghtou, Mifflin & Co. It differs 
from the edition next preceding by the expansion of 
the " Addenda " from four pages to upwards of eighty. 
This means the admission of more than a thousand new 
names, most of them belonging to new writers, although 
not a few represent meritorious reputations neglected 
in the earlier editions. The indispensable character of 
this book of reference needs no setting-f orth ; no liter- 
ary worker can do without it. 

The Chicago " Evening Post " has been separated 
from the " Times-Herald," and is now owned and edited 
independently of its former associate. The new depar- 
ture will be emphasized by a change in the format, the 
pages being reduced to one-half the former size and 
doubled in number. This makes a paper having more 
the appearance of such a weekly as " The Nation " than 
of the ordinary daily, and exemplifies the sort of ex- 
periment which we have long wished might be tried, 
and which we believe will prove successful. It is also 
a pleasure to be able to state that the " Evening Post," 
in its new form, will be free from the indignity of illus- 
tration. As far as other matters are concerned, the 
fact that Mr. Samuel T. Clover will have unhampered 
editorial control of the paper offers a sufficient guar- 
anty that the decencies will be observed, and that 
neither sensationalism nor commercialism will get the 
upper hand in its production.

A JOURNEY TO NATURE 

By J. P. MOWBRAY 

THIS delightful volume by " J. P. M." is one of the few new 
books which the reader would not part with after finishing. 
Seldom it is that one finds a more 'charming story than this- 
telling of a Wall Street broker, who, under doctor's orders, leaves 
all work and goes with his son far into the country to "recuperate." 

" During the first week of my voluntary exile I had to contemplate my eight-year-old son 
and heir with deadly concentration of purpose in order to understand that sudden death was not 
altogether preferable to slow extinction in utter solitude ... He never bent a single natural 
impulse to accommodate me. I was to bend all my case-hardened habits to accommodate him. 
He expected me to go to bed at eight o'clock and to get up at five. He had in his bones some 
kind of thermometrical arrangement with the sun. . . . When I told him that we were going 
to play Robinson Crusoe in the woods for a year, he complacently accepted it with the imme- 
diate arrangement that I was to be his man Friday." 

" All that I could see of the night was a square, velvety black space where the window 
was. It was fretted by some dim, flying wings that microscopically glistened in the vagrant 
starlight, like tiny threads woven into the blackness. Out of this mystery of the dark crept 
all kinds of shadow sounds and occult breathings. I could hear the dog barks dying off in a 
vanishing perspective . . . along the ground at regular intervals came the throb of a bass viol 
as some bull-frog twanged his string over at the mill-dam."

For Early Spring Publication 



A SUMMER HYMNAL. A ROMANCE OF TENNESSEE. 

By JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE. Illustrated by STANLEY M. ARTHURS . . . $1.25 

I2mo. Cloth extra. 

Mr. Moore has much of the quality displayed by James Lane Allen in his earlier work, " A Kentucky 
Cardinal." The scene of his romance is laid in-the blue-grass region of Tennessee, and his pages are 
rich with tender sentiment, shrewd philosophy, poetic feeling and an exquisite humor. Those who have 
read his charming short story, "Ole Mistis," will warmly welcome his first novel, and new readers are 
sure to be delighted. " Old Wash," the negro character, who figures in some of Mr. Moore's short 
stories, reappears in this book. 

THE TOWER OF WYE. A ROMANCE. 

By WILLIAM HENRY BABCOCK. Illustrated by GEORGE GIBBS $1.50 

I2mo. Cloth extra. 

This is a story of early Maryland colonial life, full of incident and interest. Mr. Babcock has, more 
artistically than any other writer, caught the atmosphere of haze and marvel through which newcomers 
to the Western World saw all things. His book is new in treatment and holds the reader's attention 
fascinated from beginning to end. 

IN SEARCH OF MADEMOISELLE. 

By GEORGE GIBBS. Illustrated by the Author $1.50 

I2mo. Cloth extra, ornamental. 

Mr. Gibbs, the artist, in this his first novel deals with the romantic and highly picturesque episode in 
American history of the struggle between the French and Spanish for the possession of Florida. This 
furnishes the background for a charming story of the love of an Englishman for Diane de la Notte, a 
French Huguenot of noble family, who has been exiled from her native land. 

DEAR DAYS. A STORY OF WASHINGTON SCHOOL LIFE. 

By ARMOUR STRONG. Illustrated . . . > *v . $1.00 

I2mo. Cloth extra. 

A book for girls, told in an unusually fresh, natural way ; and with the local color connected with the 
Nation's Capitol. The author knows Washington thoroughly, and it will be of profit, as well as interest, 
to children all over the country to obtain glimpses of life in the political center of the United States. 
The school-girls of the story act, and talk, as real children do, in a very natural and attractive way. 

THE KING'S RUBIES. A STORY FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. 

By ADELAIDE FULLER BELL. Illustrated . $1.00 

iimo. Cloth, ornamental. 

A charming story woven around the romance of " The King's Rubies," and how they came to America. 
Girls, and boys, too, will like the healthy, natural children who figure in the book, and the idiosyn- 
crasies of " Mose," the old negro character, will be found very amusing. The book is wholesome, 
strong in incident, and written in excellent style. 

LIBRARY EDITION of the novels of ELIZABETH STODDARD. 
(MRS. RICHARD HENRY STODDARD.) 

TWO MEN. TEMPLE HOUSE. THE MORGESONS. Each $1.50 

iimo, with photogravure portraits. 

"They are essentially modern and in keeping with the choicest types of recent fiction . . . the 
pioneers of something new and real in the novelist's art. Mrs. Stoddard's novels appeal to us through 
a quality of their own. Style, insight, originality, make books like ' Two Men ' and ' Temple 
House,' additions not merely to the bulk of reading but to literature itself."

The Inn of the Silver Moon 

By HERMAN K. VIELE. 16mo, 31.25. 

This book has sold only a few thousand copies, but the enthusiasm of those who have read it indicates 
that it may have almost as much distinction as the novels that " are selling a thousand a day," and perhaps 
even as seductive a charm as though it were " the book of the year." 

The story is the work of a new writer, submitted to the publishers through the mails, and issued because 
they liked it and believed others would like it. Not one reviewer has disagreed with this opinion, and 
many tired critics have found the tale as refreshing as spring water after a tramp. It must be a very deli- 
cate witchery that will rouse a hardened reviewer to the point of saying : " It will not be cared for by 
more than one reader in ten, but to that one it will be a treasure from its first reading on and on forever." 

Perhaps it would be worth while to read the book on the chance of finding oneself the one in ten. Yet 
even to the other nine the hour given to the picturesque little romance will not be dull. Illustrated by 
Edward Cucuel. 

The Love of an Uncrowned Queen 

By W. H. WILKINS. A new edition. Complete in one volume. 82.00 net. 

An important work by the author of " The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton." Sophie Dorothea, Con- 
sort of George I., and her Correspondence with Philip Christopher, Count Konigsmark (now first published 
from the Originals). 

" Now that the public curiosity aroused by An Englishwoman's Love Letters ' has been somewhat satiated, 
we should like to call attention to a work which is more deserving of the interest of that world that loves 
a lover. Some time ago Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. published a book entitled 'The Love of an 
Uncrowned Queen,' which for pure passion and genuine emotion and pathos far surpasses in human interest 
the fictitious and artificial 'letters' said to be the work of Mr. Laurence Housman. Nothing could be 
more significant of the tyranny of caprice that elects one book for popularity and neglects another without 
any sane regard for their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over ' An English- 
woman's Love Letters ' on the one hand and the utter lack of interest in The Love of an Uncrowned 
Queen ' on the other." The Neic York Times Saturday Review. 

Three Plays for Puritans 

By GEORGE BERNARD SHAW. 12mo, cloth, 81.50. 

This new volume includes " The Devil's Disciple," to which Mr. Richard Mansfield has so gracefully 
and skillfully given vitality in this country, " Csesar and Cleopatra," and " Captain Brassbound's Conver- 
sion." They make use of old device? in a new way, and their puppets are men and women with natural 
motives and human inconsistencies. Yet they are plays that no one else could write, so original are they 
in outlook, so new and personal in their point of view. There is a breadth as of the prairies about them, 
and a freshness and vigor as of the wind in the woods. The distinction of his Csesar in " Csesar and Cleo- 
patra " is an achievement. Shakespeare modeled the great commander in relief, a dignified and imposing 
figure. Mr. Shaw makes him human and approachable, yet behind his sympathy and tenderness one recog- 
nizes the conqueror. 

"This is an unusual book, crammed full of cleverness and originality." Chicago Times-Herald. 

Chapters from Illinois History 

By EDWARD G. MASON. 8vo, cloth, with portrait, $2.00. Also a limited edition of one hundred copies, 
printed on plate paper, with extra illustrations on imperial Japan vellum in white vellum binding, 
810.00 net. 

" Mr. Mason had planned to write a history of Illinois, but he only lived to complete a portion of it. 
That portion, under the title of ' Chapters from Illinois History,' is now published, and comprises the fol- 
lowing subjects: ' The Land of the Illinois,' its discovery, exploration, occupation, and settlement; ' Illinois 
in the Eighteenth Century,' Illinois in the Revolution,' The March of the Spaniards Across Illinois,' and 
' The Chicago Massacre.' What we have makes us doubly regret what we have lost by Mr. Mason's 
lamented death. But fragment though it be, it possesses an immense interest, each chapter or monograph 
being complete in itself." Chicago Journal.

A Story of the 
Origins of Christianity 

The origins of Christianity have been minutely elucidated by recent 
historical research, and the political, social, and religious conditions 
from which the Christian faith sprang are now better known to us than 
ever before. These materials have now been woven by Dr. PAUL CARUS 
into a brief and instructive story of the time of Christ, called " The 
Crown of Thorns," which is to appear in the April " Open Court." 

By omission rather than insertion, and by the presentation of facts 
of the historical milieu rather than fiction, the history of the estab- 
lishment and spread of the Christian religion is here vividly and di- 
rectly portrayed. Special illustrations for the story have been made 
by the talented artist, Mr. Eduard Biedermann. Price, lOc. ; yearly, $1.

Ut)f t?t9torp of Babylonia and 

By ROBERT WILLIAM ROGERS, Ph.D. (Leipzig), 
LL.D., F.R.G.S. 

"Most creditable to American scholarship are these two 
volumes. The recovery during the last century of the long- 
lost story of the great Semitic civilizations which perished ere 
those of Greece and Rome arose, is an achievement not less 
memorable than those of modern astronomy. The reader of 
this history will find the Old Testament record illumined 
at various points, and luster shed on the figures of the 
prophets, especially Isaiah and Jeremiah. The Old Testa- 
ment parallels to the history in hand are frankly treated. 
Professor Rogers holds that the Old Testament has been, on 
the whole, the gainer from Assyrian studies, while ' the 
apologetic value of monumental testimony has often been 
greatly exaggerated.' " The Outlook.

TWO "NET" BOOKS 



A SHORT HISTORY of 

MONKS 

& MONASTERIES 



By ALFRED WESLEY WISHART 

Sometime Fellow in Church History in 
The University of Chicago. 

IVHAT IS THOUGHT OF THE 'BOOK 
<BY MEN WHO THINK: 

ALBERT HENKY NEWMAN, D.D., LL.D., Professor of Church History 
in McMaster University, Toronto, Canada, in a signed review covering 
something over two pages in the January issue of the American 
Journal of Theology (published by the University of Chicago Press), 
referring to WISHART'S "A SHORT HISTORY OF MONKS AND 
MONASTERIES," says : 

"It may be said at once that he has produced by far the best book 
on the subject in the English language, and that it would be hard to 
find in any language a better general discussion of the various ques- 
tions involved in the history of monasticism." 

FBANKLIN JOHNSON, D.D., LL D., Professor of Church History in the 
University of Chicago, says : 

"The book presents by far the best survey of Monasticism with 
which I am acquainted, and it is the only one which even attempts to 
give a fair and dispassionate estimate of the system." 

PAUL MONROE, Ph.D., Professor of History of Education, Teachers' 
College, Columbia University, New York City, says : 

" ' Monks and Monasteries ' is one of the best brief works on the 
subject of which I know. The subject is treated in a clear and popular 
manner, and at the same time is scholarly and accurate. The treat- 
ment is the appreciative one necessary to get at the real heart of the 
subject ; and yet, with historical fairness, it sets forth the injurious as 
well as the beneficial influences resulting from the ascetic ideal and 
the monastic life. ... It can be recommended unhesitatingly to both 
classes [students and the general public] of readers." 

The New York Tribune says : 

" Mr. Wishart's theme is one which it is not easy to discuss without 
prejudice. In such a matter non-partisanship is almost an impossibility. 
To say, as one must, that his treatment of it is marked by unusual fair- 
ness and open-mindedness is, accordingly, to give him no small amount 
of praise. He is neither an assailant nor au apologist of monasticism, 
but seeks to understand it as an historical phenomenon, and to state 
without bias both the good and the evil that have flowed from it. ... 
He writes in a clear and pleasing style, and his presentation of the 
facts is accurate and instructive." 

The Independent (New York) says : 

" The book is in the best sense a Protestant work, done with strict 
scientific loyalty to the best light and knowledge to be had on the 
subject." 

With four photogravures, 8vo, hand-sewed, broad mar- 
gins, deckle edges, gilt top, 454 pages, fully indexed.

In NATURE'S 
REALM 

By Dr. CHARLES C. ABBOTT 

Author of " Upland and Meadow ," "Notes of 
the Night," "Outings at Odd Times," "The 
Birds About Us," " Bird -land Echoes," etc. 

ILLUSTRATED BY OLIVER KEMP 

WHAT THE CRITICS SAY: 

" A delightful outdoor friend." A merican Hebrew (New York). 

"At once a real art work and a volume of positive educational 
value." The Arena (New York). 

" Here is a piece of fine art in book work. The cover draws you as 
a shady tree in a stretch of beautiful meadow. You open the volume. 
What clean, bold type, inviting to read anywhere, such a joy is it to the 
eye ; what ample margin, and how fascinating are the illustrations of 
nature scattered through it. Anyone who hungers now and then for 
a quiet stroll into field and wood will find here a volume that holds him 
with delight. It has an individuality of its own, although it belongs to 
a class. . . . He is especially happy in getting a novel point of view. " 
The Standard (Chicago). 

" Of the four footed and winged friends he made in his walks, he 
writes not merely with a full understanding, but with evident affec- 
tion, describing their peculiarities, their moods and habits, and giving 
a mass of information which could be found nowhere else in more 
pleasing or appreciative language." Baltimore Morning Herald. 



" Of the artist's work nothing can be said in criticism ; its delicacy, 
truth to nature, and decorative effect are as admirable as they are un- 
usual. There are ninety of these little sketches, besides a charming 
frontispiece in photogravure." The Nation (New York). 

"A beautiful and fascinating book for those who enjoy the study of 
Nature's handiwork 'afield and afloat.' The illustrations are fine, and 
the book is extremely attractive in its appearance." The Observer 
(New York). 

"The charm of such books as these lies in their essential simplicity 
and naturalness, but the special value of Dr. Abbott's lies in the fact 
that he never becomes so absorbed in the study of component parts as

THE CASE AT STANFORD. 

When the controversy occasioned by the 
dismissal of Professor Ross from Stanford 
University was still in its early stages, we ex- 
pressed a brief opinion to the effect that the 
principle of the freedom of teaching had suf- 
fered no injury at the hands of the University 
authorities. We intended to say nothing more 
about the matter, and, in now reverting to it, 
we have, in substance, nothing to do beyond 



reaffirming the belief at first formulated in 
these pages. Since that early writing, however, 
so many statements, of such conflicting tenor, 
have appeared in the public prints, and so many 
persons have joined in the controversy, that it 
seems desirable to deal with the question at a 
somewhat greater length than before. 

It need hardly be said, by way of prelimi- 
nary observation, that THE DIAL has always 
held the principle of Lehrfreiheit as one of the 
most sacred articles of its faith, and that it 
has championed that principle, upon more than 
one occasion, to the best of its ability. But it 
has also refused to assume the attitude of those 
extremists who consider the charge that Lehr- 
freiheit has been attacked as prima .facie evi- 
dence that the attack has really been made, 
and with whom accusation is tantamount to 
conviction. Such questions are always delicate, 
calling for the most careful examination and 
the most scrupulous weighing of the evidence. 
When the University of Chicago was made the 
.victim of an attack of this sort a few years ago, 
we happened to be in a position to know how 
absolutely groundless was the case against it, 
and how distorted a picture of such a situation 
might be drawn by sensational journalism, and 
impressed upon the minds even of sober and 
judicial observers. That incident gave us a 
lesson in caution by which we hope to profit 
in the present instance. 

The case against the Stanford administration 
has been given its strongest statement, no 
doubt, in the report made by a committee of 
members of the American Economic Associa- 
tion. The names of the men signatory to that 
statement must command respect for what they 
say, and entitle their argument to a careful 
consideration. And yet we are bound to say 
that their plea is in certain respects disingen- 
uous. It certainly gives to a casual reader the 
impression that it is made with the official 
sanction of the Association to which the signers 
belong, whereas the Committee was in fact 
self -constituted, and represents only itself. Our 
suspicions are also aroused by the language of 
the report, in which it is darkly hinted that the 
most damaging facts in the possession of the 
Committee have not been included, but are 



222 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



held in reserve for a possible future publication. 
It was clearly the duty of these gentlemen to 
state their case once for all as strongly as pos- 
sible ; as it is, their action is such as to lessen 
confidence in their findings. Again, it must 
be remembered that this Report is the result 
of an investigation at long range, made by 
means of correspondence only, and as such is 
liable to errors of judgment. Moreover, nearly 
all the controversialists who have rushed to 
join in the attack upon the Western University 
are Eastern men who cannot, in the nature of 
things, have that close acquaintance with the 
facts which is so essential to the assumption 
of a truly judicial attitude. Their judgment 
seems to be based either upon an unquestioning 
acceptance of the conclusions of the Committee, 
or upon purely a priori reasoning. When they 
take such forms as the grave suggestion that a 
professorial trade union should be organized, 
and the officious warning that the ethics of the 
educational calling will be violated by the ac- 
ceptance of a chair in Stanford University, 
they certainly do not commend themselves to 
the judicious. 

Turning now to the aspects of the case as 
they present themselves from the Stanford 
point of view, we find more than enough to 
counterbalance the ex cathedra pronounce- 
ments of a wilderness of long range critics. 
We find, first of all, the report of the Com- 
mittee of Alumni appointed to make a special 
investigation of the matter, and this report is 
emphatic in its statement that freedom of 
teaching has not been attacked by the admin- 
istration. Reaching a conclusion diametrically 
opposite to that reached by the Eastern Com- 
mittee, the balance of judgment would, on the 
whole, appear to be in its favor. Against the 
greater experience and reputation of the East- 
ern men, the close familiarity of the Western 
men with all the facts of the situation may 
reasonably be urged as an offset, and the ques- 
tion of possible interestedness does not seem 
likely to have entered into the one report more 
than into the other. Moreover, the findings 
of this Committee of Alumni are approved of 
by an overwhelming preponderance of student 
and faculty opinion. Such men as Professor 
Anderson and Professor Fliigel, to name only 
two of those who have rallied to the defence of 
the administration, are not the sort of men to 
compromise with hypocrisy, or condone an of- 
fence against a principle which they hold 
sacred. Nor is that clear-headed and outspoken 
champion of all good and honest intellectual 



causes, Mr. Charles F. Lummis, who has been 
in close touch with the situation all the time, 
likely to be deceived by any sort of pretence 
or disingenuous evasion of the facts. Finally, 
President Jordan himself, who is the very em- 
bodiment of intellectual honesty and moral 
courage, has declared in unequivocal terms 
that the principle of freedom of teaching has 
been in no way involved in the recent occur- 
rences. The attempt to accuse him of palter- 
ing with words in a double sense has no more 
basis than a few casual remarks about the char- 
acter and ability of the person who has made 
all this disturbance, remarks evidently made 
out of pure kindness of heart, and now twisted 
into the evidence of double-dealing. 

The plain facts of the case seem to be that 
the instructor whose dismissal has raised all 
this pother is a young man who has never been 
able to rise to a sense of the dignity and re- 
sponsibility of his position. His defects of 
taste and of intellectual balance have long been 
understood and deplored by his associates, 
and at last his services have been dispensed 
with reluctantly, because of the outcry that 
is sure to be made in such a case, because also 
of regard for the reputation of the instructor 
himself. His position in the University had 
always been probationary, and this fact is in 
itself almost sufficient to dispose of the whole 
controversy. Before a man has received a 
permanent appointment, the authorities of no 
institution are accountable to the public for 
their dealings with him. This distinction 
between permanent and probationary appoint- 
ments is of the utmost importance, but surpris- 
ingly little attention has been paid to it during 
the recent discussion. There must be a period 
during which a man's character and capabilities 
are being tested, and while that period lasts, 
something like arbitrary action concerning him 
must be held legitimate. Upon no other con- 
dition than this can a strong university faculty 
be organized. 

After all, when serious people set themselves 
to discussing the principle of Lehrfreiheit, 
they are thinking of something very different 
from this tempest in a Stanford teapot. They 
are thinking of the deliberate attempts of ob- 
scurantist and reactionary authorities to stifle 
intellectual endeavor, and to impede the pro- 
gress of the great creative ideas that from time 
to time transform our modes of thought. They 
are thinking of such things as the occasional 
official efforts made in Germany during the 
last century to force all university teaching 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



223 



into conformity with the ideas of the monarchy 
and the established church. They are thinking 
of such things as the effort, made so energet- 
ically in the generation just preceding our own, 
to deny a hearing to the doctrine of evolution, 
and to discourage its promulgation in the rec- 
ognized institutions of learning. They are 
thinking of all sorts of attempts to influence or 
cajole or threaten thinkers of achieved reputa- 
tion, in order that the fabric of conventional 
falsehood may not be undermined and totter 
to its fall. They are not thinking at all of the 
merely disciplinary questions that must arise 
in every university when dealing with the ec- 
centricities and the lapses from good taste or 
good judgment of its young men, on trial for 
advancement in their academic career. Let 
us remember all the while that the case at 
Stanford is the case of young Professor Ross, 
of whom few people would ever have heard had 
his grievances not been exploited by journal- 
ism, and who was never in permanent appoint- 
ment. It is not, for example, and by way of 
startling contrast, the case of Professor Norton 
at Harvard, or of Professor Sumner at Yale, 
or of Professor von Hoist at Chicago. Nor, 
we may add, is it the case of President 
Jordan at Stanford. All of these gentlemen 
have made public utterances during the past 
two or three years that must have been highly 
objectionable to the constituted authorities. 
But the suggestion that these men have imper- 
iled their positions by their boldness of speech 
is too preposterous for a moment's considera- 
tion. It is when we try to imagine a case of 
this sort that we come fully to understand how 
securely the principle of Lehrfreiheit is guard- 
ed by the authorities of our great universities, 
and how certainly, should they once fail in 
their trust, would they be forced back into the 
path of duty by the overwhelming pressure of 
public opinion. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



" LIBRARY PRIVILEGES FOR RURAL DISTRICTS." 

A FURTHER WORD. 
(To the Editor of TH* DIAL.) 

In yonr issue of January 16, there appeared a com- 
munication regarding the opening of the Brumback 
Library at Van Wert, Ohio, from Mr. E. I. Antrim, 
in which the following sentences occur: " Most of the 
cities and many of the larger towns and villages of our 
country have their public libraries; it remained for this 
Ohio County to inaugurate a movement that may 
eventually bring library privileges where they are most 



needed, namely, to the rural districts . . . Under the 
stimulus already given, Cincinnati has extended its 
field of library work to all parts of Hamilton County, 
and several other counties have been discussing the ad- 
visability of imitating the example of Van Wert 
County." 

In yonr issue of March 16, Mr. A. L. Day takes ex- 
ception to Mr. Antrim's statements, and with the 
greatest of respect for the officials of the Van Wert 
library, and the sincerest and heartiest appreciation of 
the noble gift of Mr. Brumback, I wish to add a further 
word opposing the idea set forth in Mr. Antrim's com- 
munication, and declared in the address of presentation 
on the occasion of the dedication, that the Van Wert 
library is the pioneer in the matter of furnishing 
" library privileges to the rural districts." The law 
which made possible the acceptance of Mr. Brnmback's 
gift of a library building for the county must here- 
after support the library was passed April 26, 1 898. 
The agreement with the County Commissioners was 
made July 30, 1898, the building was completed and 
dedicated January 1, 1901, and the residents of the 
county first had the privileges of the library January 
28, 1901. 

The late A. W. Whelpley, for many years the Li- 
brarian of the Public Library of Cincinnati, in his annual 
report for 1892 strongly urged that the privileges of 
Cincinnati's great library be extended to the residents 
of Hamilton County the county within which Cin- 
cinnati is situate. On April 21, 1898, an act was 
passed by the General Assembly of Ohio (93 O. L. 191) 
by which our library was taken from the control of the 
Board of Education of the School district and placed 
in the bands of a Board of Trustees. This board was 
given power to make a levy of 3-10 of a mill upon all 
the taxable property of the county. In 1900 this levy 
was increased to 5-10 of a mill (94 O. L. 204). The 
act provided: 

Sec. S999a (Rev. St. of Ohio). " Each and every resident 
of the county within -which is situate any city of the first 
grade of the first class, having therein established a public 
library, shall be entitled to the free use of such library, read- 
ing rooms, and any branch of the same, and all the privileges 
thereof." 

Sec. 3999b. "They (the trustees) shall have power and 
it shall be their duty to establish in said city and throughout 
the county within which is situated said library, reading 
rooms, branch libraries and library stations in connection 
with said library, and to lease and furnish said rooms, build- 
ings or parts thereof as are required for such purposes, and 
to pay all necessary expenses connected therewith." 

Immediately upon the passage of the act, the resi- 
dents of Hamilton County were entitled to all the privi- 
leges of the Public Library of Cincinnati. The first 
card issued to a county resident, outside of the city 
limits, was under date of May 6, 1898. The delivery 
station system provided for in the act, whereby the 
books are delivered at convenient stations throughout 
the county, was opened June 10, 1899. The circula- 
tion through these stations for the year 1900 was 
179,541. There are now in operation forty stations 
and thirteen traveling libraries (the latter in places not 
easily accessible from the stations). After the passage 
of the act of 1900 authorizing the increased levy, the 
trustees offered to assume the control of each library 
in the county which had been maintained at public ex- 
pense. Under this offer the trustees have now under 
their management four branch libraries. 

The simple statement of the foregoing facts and 



224 



THE DIAL 



[April 1, 



dates should be sufficient to refute the claim made for 
the Van Wert library. The Cincinnati act is five days 
older than the Van Wert act. The privileges of the 
Public Library of Cincinnati had been free to every 
resident of Hamilton County for nearly three years 
before the residents of Van Wert County had the use 
of a book in the Van Wert library. 

But it is all in the interest of the greatest good to 
the greatest number, or to use the motto of the Ameri- 
can Library Association, " the best reading for the 
largest number at the least cost." However, there is 
an honor in being the first to extend to your fellow man 
such a boon as good reading, and if Cincinnati is en- 
titled to that honor for being the first to extend the 
use of her 225,000 volumes to the "rural districts," 
we most assuredly desire to retain the same, for we are 
proud of having " blazed the way."

THE GRAND OLD MAN OF JAPAN. 
( To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

By the death of Mr. Yukichi Fukuzawa, Japan has 
suffered the loss of one of its truly great men. From 
the fact that he lived in the Mita District of Tokyo, he 
was generally called the "Sage of Mita"; but he was 
often called " the grand old man of Japan." He was 
one of the early Japanese students of Dutch and En- 
glish. In 1858 he came from Nagasaki to Yedo, and 
opened a school which was the nucleus of the great in- 
stitution now known as the Keiogijiku, with academic, 
collegiate, and university courses. This school was not 
closed during the Revolutionary War; even during the 
Battle of Nyeno (1869), his school continued in session 
in another section of the city, and his students were 
studying Wayland's Moral Science. From this school 
have gone forth hundreds of able young men who have 
distinguished themselves in all departments of life. As 
the Japan " Times " says, " It was in this school and 
under the eye of its great master that the art of public 
speaking was first practiced ; in fact, the Japanese word 
for a public speech [oration], now so generally used, 
was coined by Mr. Fukuzawa himself. He may, indeed, 
be called a great educator, or teacher." 

In 1882 he established a daily paper called Jiji 
Shimpo (" News of the Times," or " Times "), which 
holds in Japan the same prominent place that its name- 
sakes hold in London and New York. Although in 
certain points that paper may be surpassed by some 
contemporary, yet it is, on the whole, what it claims to 
be, " the No. 1 daily of Japan." The editorials by Mr. 
Fukuzawa could always be recognized by their simple, 
clear, and forcible style, and their instructive and ele- 
vating tone. In view of the influence of his journal, he 
may again be called a great educator, or editor. 

With reference to his style of writing, it should also 
be noted that he shares with Mr. Fukuchi " the honor 
of having introduced what may be called the natural 
style in Japanese literature as distinguished from the 
stilted Chinese style." 

He was a prolific writer: his total output is said to 
have been " 50 different kinds of books, comprising 105 
volumes." (It must, however, be understood that a 
Japanese " volume " is rather small.) His writings 
were principally on social, political, and moral topics, 
and have wielded a powerful influence in Modern Japan. 



For instance, he " did more than anybody else to eman- 
cipate the fair sex from the restraints of the old- 
fashioned code of morality, by the publication of his 
Criticisms of Kaibara's Great Learning for Women ' 
and his own ' New Great Learning for Women.' " 
From a third point of view, therefore, he may be called 
a great educator, or author. 

He might have been Minister of Education, or have 
received a patent of nobility; but he refused public 
office and despised titles, except such as "the great 
commoner," which was sometimes conferred upon him. 
His life was pure and blameless; and his moral teach- 
ings were of the loftiest type. He practiced what he 
preached, so that he was once more a great educator, 
or exemplar. 

The Japan " Mail " says of him: " As a leader of the 
new civilization, it would be difficult to over-rate the 
benefits conferred by him on his country." " He is 
described as the great motive force of Japan's modern 
civilization; the man who did more than all his con- 
temporaries to promote the spread of a spirit of true 
liberalism." 

Whether as teacher, editor, essayist, author, or mor- 
alist, Mr. Fukuzawa deserves the highest rank among 
the " men of letters of New Japan."

THE MOTHER TONGUE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The efforts of THE DIAL towards improving the in- 
struction in English in the secondary schools and in the 
universities, have been highly appreciated by the lan- 
guage teachers of the country, and the agitation thus 
started has certainly been a stimulus in setting many 
a teacher to thinking and to acting. That the subject 
is one of the most important, if not the most serious, 
problems with which educators have to deal, no one will 
deny. 

Now and then there appears a case that seems utterly 
hopeless. At a recent examination in English for ad- 
mission into one of the universities, the candidates were 
asked, among other things, to write a sketch of some 
character from literature, no restriction being placed 
upon the choice. One young man, who had " taken " 
English three or more years in a high school, but evi- 
dently had not been able to retain it, produced an in- 
teresting essay ; it appears below verbatim and literatim, 
and with the original punctuation: 

"Lord. Byron, was a briliant writer of prose, he was a 
cripple being crippled both being turned in he wor a long 
clok to conseal his feet, but never the less for all hia def or- 
maties he was a great swimer, he most alway swam alone, 
he could swim for hours befor becoming tired." 

This, then, represents not only all the young man can 
write about any character in literature, but also his 
sense of accuracy and of form. 

It is needless to say that the candidate was not ad- 
mitted; he was sent back, with the blessing of the ex- 
amining committee, to take a few more doses, and, in 
all probability, will finally be declared incurable. Does 
the fault lie in the training and experience of the 
physician, or is the patient's constitution, on account 
of neglect in early childhood, too weak to bear the 
heroic treatment that seems necessary ?

A JOURNALIST'S REMINISCENCES.* 

There is an old story of an Irish butler who 
boasted that he was so skilled in his calling 
that he could put a quart of wine into a pint 
decanter ; and we have often wished that bio- 
graphers could be brought to emulate in their 
province this man's powers of compression. 
We do not say this with the intention of cast- 
ing a special reflection on Mr. Stillman's two- 
volume autobiography now before us, but in 
reference to the curious fact that even men 
who in other walks of literature are honorably 
distinguished by a Spartan continence of 
speech are apt to throw moderation to the 
winds and go on forever, like Tennyson's brook 
or Mr. Alcott the philosopher, the moment 
they begin writing biography. 

Mr. Stillman's autobiography was begun at 
the instance of the late Mr. Houghton, the 
publisher, and notwithstanding its occasional 
diffuseness it bears out the opinion of its prob- 
able value of that excellent judge of men and 
books. The story of the author's own doings 
is worth telling, and had Mr. Stillman left un- 
recorded his memories and impressions of the 
many interesting people he has foregathered 
with during his somewhat roving and desultory 
career as painter and journalist it would have 
been a real loss to the public. 

In his opening chapters Mr. Stillman gives 
an account of his home life during boyhood, 
which is an altogether capital picture of Puri- 
tan family life, abounding in vivid touches of 
characterization, and conveying an adequate 
idea of the spirit and tendencies, for evil as for 
good, of New England Puritanism in its archaic 
severity. After reading this most interesting, 
if in its details at times somewhat repellant 
and painful, section of the book one can only 
wonder how the warm humanity and genial 
bohemianism of the author's manhood could 
have germinated in so frosty an atmosphere. 
The somewhat prolix chapters dealing with 
Mr. Stillman's school days and his three years' 
stay at Union College. Schenectady, are fol- 
lowed by a brief account of his art studies in 
America, in England, and at Paris. It was 
with the opening of this period of art study 
that his rovings (we use the word in no dis- 
respectful or derogatory sense) began. In

1849 Mr. Stillman went to England to see 
Turner's pictures, and at Turner's gallery in 
London he had the good fortune to see not 
only the eccentric painter himself, but his elo- 
quent champion, Mr. Raskin. Griffiths, a 
kindly, honest man for an art-dealer, had been 
touched by the young stranger's enthusiasm, 
and introduced him one day to Turner as a 
young artist who had a great admiration for 
his work, and would be glad to take him by 
the hand. The response, if not cordial, was at 
least Turneresque. Says Mr. Stillman : 

" It was difficult to reconcile my conception of the 
great artist with this little, and, to casual observation, 
insignificant old man with a nose like an eagle's beak, 
though a second sight showed that his eye, too, was like 
an eagle's, bright, penetrating, and restless. Half awed 
and half surprised, I held out my hand. He put his 
behind him, regarding me with a humorous, malicious 
look, saying nothing. Confused, and not a little mor- 
tified, I turned away, and, walking down the gallery, 
went to studying the pictures again. When I looked 
his way again he held out his hand to me. . . . He 
gave me a hearty hand-shake, and in his oracular way 
said, ' Hmph (nod) if you come to England again 
hmph (nod) hmph (nod),' and another hand-shake 
with more cordiality and a nod for good-by. I never saw 
a keener eye than his, and the way he held himself np, 
so straight that he seemed almost to lean backwards, 
with his forehead thrown forward, and the piercing eyes 
looking out from under their heavy brows, and his 
diminutive stature coupled with the imposing bearing, 
combined to make a very vivid impression on me." 

Mr. Stillman recalls that Turner said of his 
own pictures in the course of the interview, 
" I wish they were all put in a blunderbuss 
and shot off ! " but, he adds, " he looked 
pleased at the simultaneous outburst of protest 
on the part, of Griffiths and myself." 

Mr. Stillman's account of his early ventures 
in journalism, in "spiritism," in political con- 
spiracy (he became associated with Kossuth in 
1852 and went to Europe on a secret mission 
for him), in " roughing it " in the Adirondack 
wilderness, is followed by the charming episode 
of the " Adirondack Club " one of the richest 
chapters in the book. The Club was the out- 
come of Mr. Stillman's enthusiastic stories of 
his camping experiences. Its members were 
Emerson, Agassiz, Dr. Howe, Professor Wy- 
man, Judge Hoar, Dr. Binney, John Holmes, 
Horatio Woodman, and the author. Longfellow 
was asked to be of the party, but he declined 
on learning that Emerson had bought a gun. 

" Is it true that Emerson is going to take a gun ? ' 
he asked me; and when I said that he had finally de- 
cided to do so, he ejaculated, ' Then somebody will be 
shot! ' and would talk no more of going." 

Dr. Holmes also was asked to join ; but the 



226 



[April 1, 



Autocrat had little sympathy with woods and 
savagery, and was loath to leave his beloved 
Boston. Says Mr. Stillmau : 

" He loved his Cambridge friends serenely, Lowell, 
Agassiz, and Wyman, I think, above others ; but he en- 
joyed himself most of all, and Boston more than anything 
on earth. He was lifted above ennui and discontent by 
a most happy satisfaction with the rounded world of his 
own individuality and belongings. Of the three men 
whom I have personally known in the world who seemed 
most satisfied with what fate and fortune had made 
them, namely, Gladstone, Professor Freeman, and 
Holmes, I think Holmes enjoyed himself the most." 

At Saranac, en route to the camping-place, 
an amusing incident occurred. Rumor had 
spread the report of the impending advent of 
the distinguished party of " campers," and the 
selectmen of the town had appointed a com- 
mittee to receive them. The community was 
on the qui vive to see, not Emerson or Lowell, 
but Agassiz the man who preferred life in 
America to the senatorship and the keepership 
of the Jardin des Plantes offered him by the 
Emperor of the French. The heart of democ- 
racy was touched, and Saranac turned out in 
force to meet the plain man who had slighted 
the advances of an Emperor. 

" A reception was accorded, and they (the commit- 
tee) came, having taken care to provide themselves 
with an engraved portrait of the scientist, to guard 
against a personation and a waste of their respects. 
The head of the deputation, after having carefully com- 
pared Agassiz to the engraving, turned gravely to his 
followers and said, Yes, it 's him '; and they proceeded 
with the same gravity to shake hands in their order, 
ignoring all other luminaries." 

It is not recorded that Emerson used the 
gun, the purchase of which had paused Mr. 
Longfellow's doleful prediction. His " hunt- 
ing " seems to have been in the main emblemat- 
ical, like the Emperor of China's yearly plough- 
ing. But on one occasion he developed a trace 
of the primitive longing to "kill something." 

" One Sunday morning, when all the others went out 
for the drive of the deer, Emerson asked me to take 
him out on the lake to some quiet place for meditation. 
We landed in a deep bay, where the seclusion was 
most complete, and he went into the woods to meditate. 
Presently we heard the baying of the hound as he 
circled round the lake, on the hillsides, for the deer 
were reluctant at that season to take to the water, and 
gave a long chase; and, as he listened, he began to 
take in the excitement of the hunters, and finally broke 
out abruptly, " Let us go after the deer '; and down the 
lake we went, flying at our best, but we arrived too 
late, Lowell had killed the deer. He said to me 
later, and emphatically, ' I must kill a deer'; and one 
night we went out 'jack-hunting' to enable him to 
realize that ambition." 

The "jack-hunting," however, came to 
naught, so far as Emerson's ambition was con- 



cerned, for, although three deer were sighted 
successively in easy range, the philosopher 
seems to have had as many attacks of that 
acute paralysis of the faculties known to hunters 
as " buck fever " though Mr. Stillman kindly 
ascribes the failure to pull trigger to inability 
to see the game. 

Mr. Stillman was consul at Rome in the 
early sixties, and his chapter on his experiences 
there deals very frankly with the then moral 
and political condition of the papal city, which 
seems to have been unspeakably bad. Brig- 
andage was rife, and common morality, even 
among the native clergy, was rare. When 
urged by the French authorities to license and 
regulate the disreputable houses, Pius IX. re- 
plied that " every house was a brothel, and it 
was useless to license any." Mr. Stillman 
quotes, with thinly veiled approval, a popular 
saying that " if you wanted to go to a brothel 
you must go in the daytime, for at night they 
were full of priests " ; but he adds, " Let me 
not be charged with making of this state of 
things an accusation against the Catholic re- 
ligion." Roman misrule was due to priestly 
inexperience in and official incapacity for civil 
administration ; and the situation was made 
worse by the " Italian constitutional indiffer- 
ence to questions of common morality." As 
to Pius IX., Mr. Stillman found him not only 
a devout man, but " an excellent and admirable 
one," a profound believer in the divine warrant 
and direction of his pontificate, but incapaci- 
tated for civil rule simply because it could not 
be carried out on ecclesiastical principles. 

Cardinal Antonelli, the real ruler of the 
Papal States, Mr. Stillman roundly describes 
as the " very impersonation of unscrupulous 
and malignant intellect, subtle with all the 
Italian subtlety, and unscrupulous as any of 
the brigands from the community in which he 
had his origin." 

" Antonelli had a face which gave one an idea of the 
expression ' beaute* du Diable,' for a more perfect type 
of Satanic intelligence and malignity than it showed at 
times I cannot conceive. If I had been a figure painter, 
I should certainly have painted him as Mephistopbeles, 
as he appeared in the audience room in his close-fitting 
purple costume with scarlet trimmings, his long coat- 
tails flying behind him when he moved, like the fringe 
of a flame." 

One is not a little surprised to find Mr. Still- 
man describing Charlotte Cushman, then a 
member of the American colony at Rome, as a 
sort of spiritual counterpart of the Mephisto- 
phelian Antonelli. 

" I think she possessed an utterly selfish nature, was

not at all scrupulous in the attainment of her purposes, 
and was, in effect, that most dangerous member of 
society, a strong-willed and large-brained woman with- 
out a vestige of principle. . . . She was an immense 
illustration of a maxim of Dante Rossetti to the effect 
that artists bad nothing to do with morality." 

Mr. Stillman goes on to hint darkly at certain 
" terrible " stories told of the actress by an 
artist who, when a scene-painter, had known 
her in New York, and which he cautioned Mr. 
Stillman not to repeat, since if they got to 
Miss Cushman's ears " she was quite capable 
of silencing him (the relator) in the most ef- 
fective manner " ; and, adds the author seri- 
ously, " I am of opinion that he judged her 
correctly, for she must have been a tiger when 
her passions were roused." This seems really 
too bad of Mr. Stillman. The gifted Charlotte 
was perhaps a woman of imperious temper, 
and by no means a Griselda in point of patience 
under provocation ; but that she was capable 
of resorting to the stiletto or the bowl, save as 
stage properties and in the professional way, 
we are by no means inclined to believe. 

Mr. Stillman's second volume is devoted 
mainly to his consular experiences in Crete, 
and his adventures in the Balkan countries 
and the Levant generally as foreign correspon- 
dent of the " Times " and other newspapers. 
Light is shed on Eastern questions, and Greek 
and Italian politics and politicians are inter- 
estingly discussed. An amusing chapter is 
interpolated on Rossetti and his circle. All in 
all, Mr. Stillman has given us a very enter- 
taining book, rich in reminiscences of authors 
and artists, and by no means devoid of charm 
of style and critical value. The volumes are 
inviting outwardly neat, substantial, and 
well printed. E. G. J. 



THE STORT OF FRANGIPANI'S RING.* 

The monograph entitled " Frangipani's 
Ring," by Dr. Henry Thode, the celebrated 
aesthetic philosopher and historian, was origin- 
ally published in London by John Macqueen, 
in 1894, just as its author was leaving Venice, 
after a residence of several years, to accept the 
chair of History of Art in Heidelberg Univer- 
sity. For any other man the solution of the 
problem which the book involves would have 
been a labor of years. To Dr. Thode it meant 
only a few days' casual search through the 



RING : An Episode in the Life of Henry 
Thode. Translated by J. F. C. L. Illustrated. Philadel- 
phia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



manuscripts in St. Mark's, together with a few 
days more spent in other famous libraries and 
devoted to verification and elaboration of his 
results ; and finally a gratuitous visit to the 
little village church whose altar-piece forms 
the theme of the concluding chapter. But back 
of these rapid, almost intuitive, deductions, and 
rendering them intelligible, must be understood 
a life-time of research into the history and the 
art of mediaeval Italy and Germany. 

In these days of books for the many, " Fran- 
gipani's King " is of course emphatically a book 
for the few. Yet its public should not be lim- 
ited to the antiquary, familiar with Dr. Thode's 
more profound works and duly appreciative, as 
the layman cannot but fail to be, of the erudite 
industry and nicety of deduction which the 
elaboration of this little episode displays. No 
less genuine, if less esoteric, pleasure is in 
store here for the reader to whom Jan Schorel 
is an empty name, Diirer none too suggestive 
of a definite method, and Friuli in 1513 as un- 
trodden country as Hungary ten years later. 
The casual reader, to be sure, would be certain 
to find Dr. Thode's enthusiasm too aggressive, 
the romance he unfolds elusive, and the occa- 
sional incisive phrase scarcely worth the cost 
of a passage down the bristling array of un- 
familiar names and through the droning chron- 
icles, not prone to yield up too easily their 
ghostly memories of dead years. But the 
" Gentle Reader," to borrow Dr. Crothers's 
delightful connotation for the audience fit 
though few, he who does not read running, 
who has indeed no great love for the easy 
beaten track but much for the nooks and by- 
ways of literature and history, provided he 
may explore them in good company, the 
Gentle Reader, no less than the antiquary, 
will find an altogether unique pleasure in hunt- 
ing down the legend of the ring through the 
ponderous tomes of the German and Venetian 
chroniclers and the chatty pages of Marino 
Sanuto's voluminous diaries. 

Not that the question of the ring's owner- 
ship is of any great moment, but the search 
affords opportunity of forming acquaintance 
by the way with the turbulent, bitter-hearted 
Frangipanis, with the lovely Apollonia, dear 
in her youth to an Emperor and later Count 
Christoph's willing wife, and with her brother 
Matthew Lang, the courtly humanist, arch- 
bishop and cardinal, but best remembered for 
his unchurchly " What is conscience ? " Less 
intimately do we come to know a pope or two, 
and the sour-faced Emperor Maximilian. And

over all broods the keen-eyed, thin-lipped Doge 
Leonardo Loredano, he whom Bellini painted, 
a spirit of Venice incarnate. For the chief 
charm of all this pageant is the glimpse it gives 
of the inscrutable soul of sixteenth century 
Venice, whose achievements stand out clearly 
enough on the pages of our histories, but the 
thoughts of whose heart are hidden, except 
from the initiated few. Dr. Thode is of course 
in the secret, which he does his best to share 
with the appreciative reader. 

But it is time to explain that the ring, named 
Frangipani's, upon the chance sale of which to 
Dr. Thode hangs the whole tale, is a hoop of 
finely chased gold, with the legend " Willingly 
thine own " graven upon it in Gothic script. 
It was found in the year 1892 by a peasant 
digging near Pordenone in Friuli. Dr. Thode's 
romantic interest in. the original owner of the 
ring was immediately focused and deepened by 
his happening upon a mention of the presence 
of German troops in Friuli. The dates, 1513 
and 1514, agreed with that indicated by the 
workmanship of the ring. Unable to find de- 
tailed reference to any officer except the com- 
mander-in-chief, he turned his search, half by 
chance, to Count Frangipani. Almost at once 
he came upon an account of Christoph's loss 
of a relic during the siege of Osopo, " which 
accident seemed to him to bode only the gravest 
disaster." A letter of the Countess Apollonia 
to her captive husband, which the indefatigable 
Sanuto has copied, was noted by Dr. Thode 
a few days later. Its contents made him prac- 
tically certain that the relic was contained in, 
or perhaps lost at the same time with, a ring 
which the Countess had given her husband, and 
an exact duplicate of which she "prays his 
Lordship " to have graven in Venice that he 
may wear it " for love's sake and in remem- 
brance of me." The words, she explains, " give 
the answer to those other words which stand 
in the ring sent me by your Lordship, the 
which I have by me." 

This is bare fact, a commodity in which Dr. 
'Thode does not deal. Every stage of his in- 
vestigation is enriched by anecdote and allu- 
sion, and presented against a rich background 
of national or race history. One of the most 
^spirited chapters is that upon the Frangipani 
family, passionate, reckless tricksters, faith- 
less heroes, standing with Venice to-day, then 
v back on the Emperor's side to-morrow, pos- 
sessed by no fixed policy except reconquest of 
their ancient possessions, and by no fear but a 
^fugitive one for their God. Count Christoph 



comes honestly by his burning hatred of the 
Signoria, honestly too by the disgusting bru- 
tality with which he celebrates his first decisive 
victory, and by the desperate energy whereby, 
seeking to transform Maximilian's listless ag- 
gression upon Venetian territory into a mad 
war to the death, he brings himself, when he 
has played out his hand, a priceless hostage to 
the dingy Torresella. 

No less strongly drawn than this stormy 
warrior, " heir of all the passions and ambi- 
tions of his race," is the captive Frangipani, 
fretting through years of bitter inaction in the 
city he hates. Watching the gay life below 
him, he comes to appreciate as never before 
the power wielded by the long, resistless arm 
of the Ten, able in the midst of wars with half 
of Christendom to make their city a haven of 
peace and luxurious security. He writes 
lengthy letters to his wife, Apollonia, and his 
father, the lawless Bernhardin, curious 
mixtures of thanks to God who will some day 
give him the victory, propitiatory references 
to the noble Signoria (who overlooked his cor- 
respondence), fervent expressions of love 
" eternal and unchanging " for his dear wife 
and revered father, and carefully explicit 
statements of his need of bed-linen, short-hose, 
and good Rhenish ducats for his present ne- 
cessities. Once he writes out, for the diversion 
of his keeper, an account of a dream he had, 
and he has no doubt much leisure for medita- 
tion upon the favors of princes and cardinals 
as well as upon the multitude of his own sins. 
For these, in characteristic Frangipani fashion, 
he repents, now that he has nothing better to 
do. He makes a vow to the Madonna of Chi- 
oggia (which Venice never let him pay), and 
devoutly carves his motto, " My hope is set 
truly in God," over the grim walls of the 
Torresella. Perhaps he even took some part 
in the translation of the Germano-Roman 
Breviary, which was printed in 1518 three 
years after Maximilian's Prayer-book. 

But before this, in the third year of his im- 
prisonment, came Apollonia to Venice, sick 
unto death, but ready " to endure the very 
uttermost " to be with her dearly loved lord. 
From this point the romance hastens on to its 
tragic finish. Apollonia died broken-hearted, 
and the count, left to his own passionate de- 
vices, broke prison and spent the eight years 
until his death in harassing the Venetian fron- 
tiers, fighting with the Turks, now as friend, 
now as enemy, and urging to a white heat the 
strife of factions in Hungary, whose throne is

evidently the goal of his lawless and ill-fated 
ambitions. 

The scholarly accuracy with which Dr. 
Thode marshalls his folios is relieved and 
lightened by his almost childlike enthusiasm 
over his results. The tracing out of the ring's 
ownership is truly, as the sub-title of his mono- 
graph puts it, " an event in his life," a vivid 
experience into which he throws all the senti- 
ment of his quaint personality. And if, a better 
lover than his hero, he cannot suppress an oc- 
casional rhapsody over Apollonia, and perhaps 
reads a bit of himself into the moody Croatian 
Count, his story is surely none the worse for 
the fault. 

" I read the words no ! I heard them ! " 
he announces naively of the motto on his treas- 
ured ring. It is this very freshness and dra- 
matic enthusiasm in his point of view that 
makes his book unique, and alive in spite of 
the fact that its complex setting is absolutely 
new ground for the average reader. 

Another quality rare in the antiquary is our 
author's truly epic feeling for the value of di- 
gression. Not without the predilection of his 
kind for citations and footnotes, he relegates 
his bibliography to a brief appendix ; but he 
revels in legitimate episode, and is never in 
too much haste to indulge in a bit of friendly 
chat upon side-issues. Of Marino Sanuto, the 
Boswell of sixteenth century Venice, he tells 
us that his handwriting is " not very legible." 
The citations from another chronicler, a love- 
lorn captain of Vicenza, are prefaced by the 
wholly irrelevant information that it was he 
who first set down in writing the sad story of 
the loves of Romeo and Juliet, as it was told 
him by a romantic fellow in his troop. Albert 
Diirer's visit to Venice is introduced apropos 
of a possible meeting between him and Apol- 
lonia's brother the goldsmith, while we catch 
a glimpse of the " monkish brawl " just con- 
vulsing Germany as it cast its shadow over the 
joyless death-bed of Maximilian. 

The present edition of " Frangipani's Ring " 
is a sumptuous one, richly illustrated with very 
beautiful photographic reproductions. These 
include portraits of Maximilian and the Doge 
Leonardo Loredano a comparison of which 
goes far toward explaining Venetian triumphs, 
odd cuts from Maximilian's and the Frangi- 
pani Prayer-books, and photographs of Jan 
Schorel's altar-piece ordered for the church in 
Ober-Vellach by Apollonia's daughter and 
representing, with the kindly leniency of the 
old masters, Saints Christoph and Apollonia 



flanking a central panel of the Holy Family. 
For this elegant book with its wide margined 
pages, its curious chapter-headings designed by 
a friend of Dr. Thode, and its choice repro- 
ductions of Diirer and Bellini, the linen cover 
seems a singularly inappropriate housing.

THE PERVERSION OF HISTORY.* 

Mr. Ernest Belfort Bax is the author of 
many excellent works on socialism, and in par- 
ticular early made a name and a place for him- 
self in an examination of the religious and 
ethical aspects of the modern socialistic move- 
ment. Of late he has turned his attention to 
history, in monographs upon periods of popular 
revolution and the men who created them. In 
this work he has evidently adopted the method 
of the scholar in the study of his subject, and 
that of the partisan in the writing of his book. 
Great labor in research is exhibited, facts are 
accurately stated and citations are exact, but 
deductions from those facts are so colored by 
a bitter socialistic prejudice as to be entirely 
untrustworthy. Mr. Bax's latest effort, a life 
of Marat, is a notable example of this biased 
perspective. 

Marat, the bete noir of the Girondin his- 
torians of the French Revolution, from whom 
other historians have until recently taken their 
cue, has commonly been described as a man of 
little ability, limited influence, unbounded 
ferocity, and a personality disgusting both in 
its physical and mental characteristics. From 
this dictum Mr. Bax rescues his hero. Mr. 
Bax is not alone nor is he first in portraying 
his subject in the newer light. All careful 
modern historians coincide with the view which 
shows Marat to be in fact a man of education, 
distinguished as a physician and a scientist. 
A disciple of Rousseau, he sacrificed position 
and wealth to the cause of the people, and by 
the integrity of his conduct, as well as the 
radical character of his political views, main- 
tained great influence over the Parisian popu- 
lace. He, far more than Robespierre and his 
friends, led the Jacobin attack upon the Giron- 
dists, standing at first utterly alone in the bit- 
ter struggle, and winning his victory by sheer 
courage and force of will. He was honestly 
convinced of the necessity of the violence which 
he urged. Earlier histories fail to state with

Belfort Bax. Boston : Small, Maynard & Co.

sufficient emphasis the influence he exerted, or 
the devotion of the people to his person. 

Mr. Bax brings out all these qualities of 
person and conditions of influence, and in do- 
ing so exhibits unusual biographical ability ; 
but he goes far beyond other writers in his 
unbounded admiration for Marat's abilities, 
and in approval of his acts. It is one thing 
to applaud the purity of Marat's motives, an- 
other to approve the motive itself ; one thing 
to uphold his honesty of purpose in the use of 
violence, another to defend the results of that 
violence. Mr. Bax yields all his admiration 
to all that Marat did or wished to do. He does 
more than this : he defends every act and every 
incident of Marat's life with the ardor of a 
fanatical partisan, while the results of such de- 
fense are published under the guise of a critical 
and a scholarly examination of his subject. 
Moreover, Mr. Bax is either dishonest or illog- 
ical in the arguments advanced in Marat's be- 
half, e. g., Marat denied any honesty of purpose 
or patriotic enthusiasm to the nobles for their 
surrender of feudal rights on the famous night 
of August 4. That Marat should have been 
thus unjust, is explained by Mr. Bax on the 
ground of political necessity ; he could not risk 
the loss of political influence by approval of 
this act of the nobles, "and hence from the 
politician's point of view, rather than the psy- 
chologist's, Marat's caustic criticism appeared 
completely justified." But inasmuch as Mr. 
Bax invariably measures his hero from the 
standpoint of the psychologist, as he must in 
order to defend his acts with any degree of 
success, his inconsistency here weakens his 
cause. 

Naturally the author's greatest difficulty 
arises from the necessity to explain and con- 
done Marat's continual invocation of the use 
of violence to secure and maintain social and 
political revolution. It is certain that Marat 
believed force necessary to secure these ends, 
and was not only not bloodthirsty, as his 
enemies accused him of being, but was even 
personally distressed at the necessity of using 
such means. But Mr. Bax is not fortunate in 
his treatment of this subject. Writing of 
various exhortations in the Ami du Peuple to 
lop off the heads of aristocrats, he says : 

" There can be no doubt whatever that by such utter- 
ances as these, Marat, whose single-minded object was 
to save the Revolution from the various plots which 
there is no denying were at this time being constantly 
hatched against it, was only concerned to keep public 
attention alive to the manoeuvres of the Court and its 
satellites." 



He concludes with a quotation from a " Fort- 
nightly Review " article by Mr. Bowen Graves. 
" Threats of bloodshed are, no doubt, only too fre- 
quent, but always in language such as, to an impartial 
mind, excludes the idea of calculation. One day it is 
ten thousand heads that must fall, the next it is a hun- 
dred thousand, a third it drops to fifty thousand, a 
fourth to twenty, and so on. A few hours before his 
death, he tells us in his journal what he meant by them: 
' I used them,' he says, ' with a vi'ew to produce a strong 
impression on men's minds, and to destroy all fatal 
security.' " 

Thus Marat is here acquitted of any intention 
actually to carry out his threats. But in an- 
other chapter, treating of Marat as a political 
power, Mr. Bax, in order to prove the personal 
magnetism of his hero, recounts a conversation 
between Marat and Robespierre in which the 
latter said he supposed the " sanguinary de- 
mands for the blood of enemies of liberty were 
only spoken in the air, and were not seriously 
meant." Marat indignantly denied this. 

" As to its being no mere rhetorical form, he assured 
Robespierre that, after the horrible affair of Nancy, he 
could have decimated the barbarous deputies who ap- 
plauded it; that he would willingly have sent the in- 
famous judges of the Chatelet to the stake; that again, 
after the massacre of the Champ de Mars, if he had 
but found two thousand men animated with the same 
sentiments as himself, he would have placed himself 
at their head, poignarded the General (Lafayette) in 
the midst of his brigand-battalions, burnt the despot in 
his palace, and strangled the traitorous representatives 
in their seats, as he had declared at the time. Robes- 
pierre listened to me with terror,' he says, ' he grew 
pale and was silent for some time.' " 

So after having asserted that Marat did not 
really mean to proceed to extremities, Mr. Bax, 
in his desire to emphasize his hero's political 
influence, reverses his previous judgment. 

These extracts refer to a period when Marat 
had not yet had the opportunity of putting 
into effect his threats of violence. When, 
later, Marat really became a leader in the Sep- 
tember massacres, Mr. Bax shifts the ground 
of his defense to an insistence upon the purity 
of Marat's motives, and to a favorite compari- 
son with the acts of Thiers at the time of the 
Parisian commune of 1871. He says : 

" The thousand odd victims (of the September Mas- 
sacres) were almost wholly well-to-do hangers-on of 
the Court. But who were the twenty or thirty thousand 
victims of 1871 ? Almost wholly workmen, partisans 
of a cause avowedly hostile to wealth and privilege, 
and therefore hated by wealth and privilege. Herein 
lies the ground of the divergence in the world's judg- 
ment of the two events. If the ' world ' would only be 
candid in the matter, and avow openly that it likes 
well-to-do Royalist plotters, and dislikes Proletarian 
insurgents, we should know where we were, and the 
issue would at least be clear."

Putting aside other considerations tending to 
form the " world's " judgment upon these two 
events, it is at least clear that a policy of 
violence, solely destructive in its purpose, and 
failing in its objects, cannot stand in popular 
judgment, with a violent constructive policy 
that succeeded. Looking only at the purity 
of motive, as does Mr. Bax in defense of Marat, 
it is difficult to see why an equal purity of 
motive should not be ascribed to Thiers. Yet 
Thiers is a " scoundrel," while Marat is a hero. 
In a like manner Mr. Bax characterizes each 
of Marat's opponents : Lafayette is a rascal, 
Mirabeau a traitor, Bailly a silly-minded 
savant. The royalists and constitutional mon- 
archists are always denied any patriotic honesty 
of purpose, and Marat is always right in re- 
garding them as intriguing plotters, and fit 
subjects for violent retribution. Surely if the 
" lying Carlyle " has perverted history in the 
interest of a class, Mr. Bax is equally guilty 
in the interest of a social theory. Of Marat's 
assassination he writes : 

" Ob, exponents of a class public opinion, satellites 
of privileged power and wealth, wbose tap of indigna- 
tion and gassy borror is always turned on to the full 
whenever a representative of privileged class-interest is 
smitten down you who can slaver a slain monarch or 
statesman with undeserved adulation, who can fulmi- 
nate against the anthor of his death at the top of your 
voices, when will you find your cant no longer profitable? 
What has been your attitude towards the ' People's 
Friend ' and the dastardly wretch who murdered him 
her sick and helpless victim ? As one might only ex- 
pect, your sympathy has changed sides. Your horror ' 
at assassination has suddenly evaporated. For the man 
who suffered a four years' martyrdom for his convic- 
tions and for the cause of the disinherited, and who 
finally sealed his testimony with his blood, you have no 
words but those of coarse vituperation and the foulest 
calumnies that malice can divise. . . . To every un- 
prejudiced reader of history the deed of Charlotte Cor- 
day must appear as the most dastardly, cruel, and 
wanton political assassination in the world's archives." 

Invective is not the weapon best suited to 
win a hostile " world," nor will a denial of 
patriotic motives to the opponents of Marat 
enable Mr. Bax to convince the " unprejudiced 
reader of history." Thus his very partisan- 
ship forbids the realization of his object. Has 
he an object ? The u lying Carlyle " did not 
intentionally pervert history, for he gave the 
facts as he knew them. Mr. Bax, idealizing 
Marat, stating the facts of his life and influence, 
and mis-stating the motives of other patriots, 
seeks to emphasize the rights of a propaganda 
of socialistic reform, as against all constituted 
government, and to deny to such governments 
the right of self-defense. He has not merely 



perverted history : he has prostituted it, for it 
is impossible to believe that a man of Mr. Bax's 
ability and scholarship, as exhibited in other 
writings, is in this instance either uncon- 
sciously dishonest or honestly illogical. It is 
unfortunate for the reputation of Marat that 
the author's purpose, evident to the most casual 
reader, casts an unjust doubt on the real great- 
ness of his hero. EPHRAIM D. ADAMS. 



OUTL.IXES OF GERMAX LITERATURE.* 

In easy and popular style, Professor R. W. 
Moore has presented the main outlines of Ger- 
man literature in his " History of German 
Literature." The book is a revision and exten- 
sion of a course prepared for English readers, 
which has been tested for several years in col- 
lege classes. Its purpose is to offer in a concise 
and attractive way a course for students and 
others who wish to know something about the 
great men and the important works of German 
literature." The characteristics of the different 
literary movements are clearly stated ; the 
writers of each period are treated according to 
their importance, and brief resumes give a 
general knowledge of their best works. 

As is to be expected, the main portion is 
devoted to the literature of the modern period, 
beginning with Luther. Luther's work in 
giving to the German nation a uniform, stan- 
dard literary language is justly praised as his 
" greatest service to literature. Especially 
through his translation of the Bible, which 
came into the people's hands all through Ger- 
many, did this new High German gain a foot- 
hold, and become the exclusive literary lan- 
guage, that has remained until the present 
time " (p. 59). Perhaps more space should 
have been devoted to his work, which was the 
most important of any before the classical 
period. His reforms were not confined to re- 
ligious beliefs, but influenced all parts of life 
by exalting the individual and stimulating 
personal effort. His prose writings show great 
variety of style, and contributed much to the 
development of the literature by arousing a 
national feeling and stirring men to mental 
action. 

The classical period receives the fullest 
treatment, as it deserves. The opening of the 
period by Klopstock, the development under

Leasing and Herder to the full maturity under 
Goethe and Schiller, are well described. As 
with special preference the author dwells on 
the two greatest names, the poets of Faust 
and Wallenstein, The latter he calls " the 
first and greatest poet " in the popular mind. 
" His poetry by its wide circulation and its 
natural genuineness has nourished in the Ger- 
man people the most noble sentiments love 
for the fatherland, for freedom, for honor, for 
justice and truth, for friendship and fidelity " 
(p. 175). In Goethe, on the other hand, 
" were united Klopstock's ability to enrich the 
language, Lessing's clearness of vision and 
bold individuality, Wieland's elegance and 
grace, Herder's universality, and Schiller's 
rhythm and rhetoric. His works and his in- 
fluence will endure as long as language lasts " 
(p. 187). 

Of the multitude of authors of the present 
age, the most important are briefly discussed, 
and the various literary tendencies are clearly 
brought out. The tendency during the last 
few years is described as a " revolt of the 
working classes against the middle classes." 
Some will miss familiar authors, although the 
list of those mentioned is quite complete. 
Bertha von Siittner's " Waffen Nieder " might 
have been used as a good illustration of the 
"novels of purpose" (p. 251). Johanna 
Ambrosius, whose poetry so touched the people 
recently, and Rosegger, whose simple sketches 
are full of the breath of nature, seem to de- 
serve some brief recognition. 

Credit might have been given (p. 193) to 
the scholarly labors of Jacob and William 
Grimm in the domain of mediaeval literature 
and especially in legend and folk-lore. Men- 
tion might also have been made of the cele- 
brated historians of the present age, such as 
Mommsen, Ranke, von Sybel, and Treitschke, 
whose works are ornaments of literature as well 
as of scholarship. But these criticisms are 
slight compared to the merit of the work as a 
whole, which will prove a boon to college 
classes and to many general readers. About 
a hundred illustrations, all of authentic or his- 
torical nature, are an attractive feature.

RECENT ECONOMIC LITERATURE.* 

For several decades past, studies made by English- 
speaking economists in the theory of distribution 
have been mostly of a fragmentary character. The 
promulgation of the law of marginal utility by 
Jevons and the Austrian writers has been followed 
by a mass of literature dealing with theories of 
value and price, and numerous attempts have been 
made to apply these theories to the valuation of 
labor, the origin of interest, and to explaining the 
existence of surplus-values in the shape of profits 
and rent. Not until recent years have there been 
serious attempts made to harmonize and consolidate 
these theories into a general theory of distribution. 
Of these attempts none seems more satisfactory 
or more likely to find a permanent place in the- 
literature of economics than the works of Messrs. 
Clark and Hobson now before us. 

Both writers have contributed largely to the de- 
velopment and extension of the theories above 
mentioned. Professor Clark's theoretical work 
alone covers a period of twenty-five years, while, 
for at least a decade, Mr. Hobson has been promi- 
nent among the British economists of the newest 
school. 

There is not space within the limits of this article 
to do more than give a scanty notice to the theory of 
distribution developed by each author, and there is 
no room to institute an adequate comparison between 
them. Perhaps even a lengthy comparison would 
at present be premature, since Professor Clark's 
work is an unfinished one, and it is only in the 
second volume which he promises that we .may ex- 
pect to find work analogous to that done by Mr. 
Hobson in his present treatise. Nevertheless, there 
are some points of resemblance which may be noted, 
and some points of difference between the theories 
of the two writers which may be briefly touched 
upon. Both writers agree in making the price of 
commodities the starting point in the theory of 
distribution. Professor Clark takes normal price 
as his starting point, for he is investigating distri- 
bution in a static society in which all disturbing 
forces are eliminated and competition alone has 
free play. Mr. Hobson, on the other hand, takes 
as his starting point the market price of commodi-

ties, because his study of distribution begins with 
the bargaining process which goes on in actual life 
between buyer and seller. Competition does not 
in such a case fix the price of commodities, but 
only the limits below which the seller will not go 
and above which the buyer will not go. Between 
these two limits the actual price is determined by 
the superior bargaining power of a single buyer or 
seller. This leads to an element of forced gain 
that accrues to that side of buyers or sellers which 
possesses the shrewdest bargainer. In addition to 
this, there is a differential gain shared in by all 
buyers and sellers whose subjective valuations lie 
beyond the limits within which the price is fixed. 
In a static state, such as is described by Professor 
Clark, no element of forced gain could appear. 
Each party to the bargain in fixing a price would 
secure the full measure of its productivity. Applied 
to the case of the factors of production, free com- 
petition tends to give labor what it creates, to 
capital what it creates, and to entrepreneurs what 
the coordinating function creates." In both theories, 
the element of differential gain still remains. If, 
for example, on a given amount of land a number 
of units of labor of equal productivity be applied 
unit by unit, the productivity of the labor will 
diminish after a certain point has been reached. 
As the units of labor are supposedly equal, the 
product of the final unit will fix the wages of each 
and every other unit, and a rent will accrue to land 
as a result of the surplus created by the application 
of the earlier units. This is rent in the Ricardian 
sense, a differential gain secured by land as a result 
of the diminishing productivity of labor upon the 
land. But we may have the same thing in the 
case of capital. The application of successive units 
of labor to a fixed amount of capital will result in 
differential gains which accrue in this instance to 
capital. Reversing the process and applying units 
of capital to a given amount of labor, we find capital 
subject to the same law of diminishing returns, and 
labor in this case secures a surplus, rent. This ex- 
tension of rent by Professor Clark to all the factors 
of production is exactly paralleled in the discussion 
by Mr. Hobson. Corresponding to the forced gain 
in the sale of commodities, there may be a marginal 
rent in the sale of the factors of production which 
is not the same as the differential rent explained 
by Ricardo as accruing to land and by Professor 
Clark as due to all the factors of production. We 
have already stated that Professor Clark does not 
find this forced gain or marginal rent existing in a 
static society. What we here wish to emphasize is 
that both writers agree in extending the conception 
of differential rents to labor and capital as well as 
to land. Mr. Hobson holds that we cannot speak 
of a margin of employment for land any more than 
we can for capital and labor. If we can say that 
the worst land in cultivation bears no rent, we can 
just as well say that the worst placed capital gets 
no interest and the worst employed labor receives 
no wage. If this theory be true that a differential 



gain may under certain circumstances accrue to 
labor, it is clear that we cannot speak of an expro- 
priation of the product of labor by capitalists and 
land-owners. The distribution of the surplus will 
depend upon the relative supply of the three factors 
of production. If labor is scarce as compared to 
capital and land, the surplus will go to labor, and 
we might with equal fairness speak of the exploita- 
tion of capital by the laborer. There is no ex- 
ploitation involved in giving to any factor the share 
which the final unit produces. 

The recent interest in trusts has brought forward 
numerous books, pamphlets, and magazine articles 
dealing with that interesting and perplexing prob- 
lem. Among the discussions of this topic most 
favorably received have been the recent books by 
Professor Jenks and Mr. Collier, which must here 
be dealt with more briefly than they deserve. Both 
works are written for the general reader rather 
than for the advanced student in economics, and 
with few exceptions they contain little that has not 
been made available to the student by earlier and 
more complete investigations. The scope of the in- 
quiry is practically the same in each of the vol- 
umes, and the two authors agree in the main in 
their conclusions. Both writers admit that the chief 
cause of the growth of industrial combinations in 
the past quarter century has been intense and often 
wasteful competition. Both authors also agree in 
the statement that special privileges such as patents, 
tariff legislation, and railway discriminations, have 
often aided in this growth. Professor Jenks is, 
however, more logical in his attitude toward these 
privileges than is Mr. Collier. For the latter, hav- 
ing admitted that competition is the chief and suf- 
ficient cause of trusts, maintains that the abolition 
of these special privileges would cause the disap- 
pearance of the majority of the trusts. It should 
also be noted that Professor Jenks views with more 
concern the disappearance of competition as a force 
which controls prices, than does Mr. Collier. Both 
authors, however, regard potential competition as 
in the main a sufficient safeguard for the consumer 
of trust-made commodities in cases where neither 
legal nor natural monopolies exist. A study of the 
prices charged by some of the great industrial com- 
binations such as the sugar, whiskey, kerosene, tin- 
plate, and wire and steel trusts, made by Professor 
Jenks for the United States Industrial Commission, 
leads him to the conclusion that while prices have 
fallen since the establishment of these combinations 
the general level of prices is somewhat higher than 
would have probably prevailed had competition had 
full play in these industries. The statements often 
made by trust managers that industrial combina- 
tions have made the market for their products more 
steady seems to have little justification. The temp- 
tation to raise prices, or to maintain them at a high 
level, is so strong that when once a monopoly has 
been established few trust managers have been able 
to resist the desire for high profits. This in the 



234

case of capitalistic monopolies has inevitably re- 
sulted in the bringing into the field of new capital 
to compete with the trust, and before the latter 
could regain its former supremacy it has been ob- 
liged to buy up or coerce these competing estab- 
lishments. 

The most serious menace to the public from 
the trusts is probably to be found in the methods 
by which these combinations are being organized 
and manipulated. The principal sufferer is not the 
consumer but the investor. The great success of 
certain of these combinations has brought into the 
field of corporation finance within recent years a 
class of persons known as promoters, whose business 
consists in the efforts to form combinations among 
industrial establishments which have hitherto been 
subject to the control of competition. In this way 
industrial consolidation has been brought about in 
many cases where it would not have taken place, at 
least for some time to come, had natural forces alone 
controlled. The promoter is usually paid for his ef- 
forts by common stock issued beyond the capitalized 
valuation of the property of the consolidated com- 
panies. In addition to receiving preferred stock, 
whose par value equals the total capitalized value of 
their property, the owners of the establishments thus 
consolidated usually receive a bonus in the shape of 
large amounts of common stock. There is further- 
more the underwriter, usually a banker, who under- 
takes the sale of the stock. He also receives his pay 
in common stock. It is not difficult to see that in 
this way trusts are capitalized far beyond the limits 
which a prudent financial administration would 
warrant. One of the most prominent of our present 
industrial combinations has in this way been cap- 
italized at $50,000,000, while the total selling value 
of the properties consolidated was only $18,000,000. 
Excessive capitalization means stock and bank 
speculation, losses to investors, dangers to consumers 
from an attempt to raise prices so as to pay divi- 
dends on the stock thus issued, instability to busi- 
ness, and perhaps a panic brought about by the 
collapse of these undertakings. 

Of the remedies proposed, the one most insisted 
upon by both the above writers is publicity in re- 
gard to the finances and the methods employed by 
these combinations. Publicity alone would prob- 
ably cause the disappearance of some of the chief 
evils connected with trust organization and man- 
agement, and until we have this publicity, as Pro- 
fessor Jenks well says, we cannot proceed wisely in 
the application of further remedies. Both writers 
apparently admit that the trust has brought much 
good and that it has come to stay. Prohibition has 
everywhere proved a failure, and is not recom- 
mended by either writer. The abolition of the 
special privileges which have aided in the growth 
of trust formation, and the prevention of over- 
capitalization, are of course advocated wherever the 
removal of these special privileges would not cause 
a serious derangement of industry. Mr. Collier 
would add to these remedies by making directors 



of these great corporations responsible to the full 
amount of their property instead of giving to them 
the limited liability conceded to other stockholders. 
In case these remedies proved insufficient, he would 
have acts of monopoly declared a crime, leaving to 
the courts the difficult task of deciding whether or 
not monopoly really existed. 

Professor Edward D. Jones, of the University of 
Wisconsin, is responsible for a well-written little 
volume on " Economic Crises." This is the first 
systematic treatment of this subject in its entirety 
that we have had in English. Professor Jones 
does not undertake to discuss at any length partic- 
ular crises and their causes. His work is chiefly a 
review of the theories of crises which have been 
brought forward by other writers, and a critical 
examination of these theories in the light of our 
present economic knowledge. The treatment is 
somewhat fragmentary in character, and the author 
is perhaps a little too dogmatic in his own state- 
ment of opinions, but on the whole the discussion 
of the various theories is made in an impartial 
manner, and the conclusions seem to be the result 
of sound reasoning. There is an able chapter on 
the periodicity of crises in which the author, while 
not denying the existence of periodicity, claims that 
the proof of such regularity in the appearance of 
crises is not yet sufficient, and that no explanation 
for such periodicity has been offered which is at all 
adequate. Professor Jones lays great stress on the 
abuse of credit as the cause of crises, but points out 
that there is a danger in attributing crises to a 
single kind of credit abuse such as banking specu- 
lation. In the final chapter on the " Psychology 
of Crises," the author studies the individualistic 
motives underlying crises. These industrial dis- 
turbances he declares to be due in large degree to 
a tendency toward speculation, and to undue optim- 
ism in regard to the outcome of business projects. 
The chief preventives the author finds in the sub- 
ordination of economic interests to other motives 
and in such an increase of information concerning 
the facts of the modern industrial world as is to be 
gained through commercial education. These rem- 
edies, however, furnish only a partial solution. 
" The final extinguishment of crises will come 
through the progress of general economic evolution 
rather than as the result of the application of 
specific remedies." 

The title of Dr. Fairchild's book, " Rural Wealth 
and Welfare," the experience of its author who for 
thirty-five years has been connected with agricul- 
tural colleges, and the place of the treatise in 
" The Rural Science Series," all would lead one to 
expect that the book was a treatise on agricultural 
economics, for which there is at present a genuine 
need. It is extremely disappointing, therefore, to 
find that Dr. Fairchild's book is only another treat- 
ise on elementary economics, differing in no way 
from the average text-book on that subject, except 
that perhaps the majority of the illustrations are

taken from farm life. The author has prepared 
some interesting and valuable charts intended to 
show that conditions of demand and supply are the 
controlling factors in the making of prices of agri- 
cultural commodities, and that speculative move- 
ments have exerted but little influence. He is wise 
in his insistence on the value of accurate crop sta- 
tistics to the agricultural class, and points out that 
such information would do more to destroy the 
demoralizing force of mere speculation than any pos- 
sible legal enactment." There are some sensible 
chapters on banking, insurance, and the tariff, and 
here and elsewhere there are good suggestions as to 
methods by which farmers may make use of division 
of labor, credit associations, and other means by 
which modern business has attained to successful 
organization and results. The value of these sug- 
gestions leads one to wish that this part of the work 
had been more fully worked out, leaving to other 
treatises the statement of elementary principles 
common to the whole field of economics. Dr. Fair- 
child takes an optimistic view of the drift of the 
farming population into the cities. He considers 
this merely a means of readjusting industrial ar- 
rangements, and one which is made possible and 
necessary by the wide use of agricultural machinery 
which has enabled three men to do the work that 
fourteen did forty years ago. Even the abandon- 
ment of New England farms he does not consider 
a great social loss, though it may have injured in- 
dividuals. " These lands will find a profitable use 
in the wood lots throughout the East and in grazing 
ranches through the West, with slight permanent 
loss. They are not signs of poverty but of a devel- 
oping trait, just as the abandoned country woolen 
mills tell the story of immense growth in factory 
methods." 

Mr. Carnegie's book, " The Gospel of Wealth," 
consists of a group of essays, all of which have 
appeared in English or American magazines or 
periodicals. They cover a wide range of subjects 
biographical, economic, social, and political, but 
may perhaps be conveniently divided into three 
groups. The first five essays deal with social and 
industrial questions, the next two with the recent 
political tendencies in this country, while the last 
four deal with English political problems and ten- 
dencies. Mr. Carnegie's well-known views con- 
cerning the use to be made of large accumulations 
of wealth are set forth in the essay which gives the 
title to the book. Mr. Carnegie's natural attitude 
as a man who has accumulated an immense fortune, 
toward the accumulation of wealth, leads him to 
attach great importance in the social and industrial 
sphere to individual leadership. He is inclined 
even at this late day to agree with Adam Smith 
that enterprises undertaken by joint stock companies 
are likely to prove failures unless they are con- 
trolled by a few able men. For the same reason 
he does not place much confidence in cooperative 
enterprises as a means of solving the labor problem. 
He takes a sympathetic attitude toward Trade- 



Unions, and is a firm believer in the justice of the 
sliding scale. Mr. Carnegie deplores strikes, but 
calls upon employers to observe patience when 
strikes occur, and he recognizes the equity of the 
striking man's commandment, " Thou shalt not take 
thy neighbor's job." Mr. Carnegie's attitude on 
the question of Imperialism is well-known, and 
scarcely requires comment. He deals fairly with 
his opponents, and gives them credit for sincerity. 
His views concerning British administration in 
India, and the administration of tropical countries 
in general, are doubtless equally sincere, but they 
are opposed, it should be said, to the opinions of 
men who have observed less superficially and have 
studied the question more profoundly. Mr. Car- 
negie opposes the imperial federation of Britain 
and her colonies, a scheme which he regards as 
impracticable as well as undesirable, but he dreams 
of an Anglo-Saxon alliance in which all English- 
speaking nations shall share. Nothing, however, 
has done so much to hasten the realization of such 
a project as the recent cooperation of the two great 
English-speaking nations in the far East, a move- 
ment which could not have taken place had it not 
been for our acquisition of Eastern possessions 
which Mr. Carnegie has so strenuously and vigor- 
ously opposed. 

War and Labour " is another of the numerous 
attempts made by political philosophers to promote 
universal peace. The author, M. Anitchkow, is, 
however, scarcely an idealist. He does not think 
that this peace can be made a never-ending one. 
" War," he says, " is the lot of mankind and the 
inevitable destiny of nations." In the first part of 
his treatise, the author reviews and criticises the 
various proposals which have been made by other 
writers to secure the same end. He decides that 
neither the increase of armaments, the greater de- 
structiveness of modern artillery, the efforts of 
peace societies, nor international agreements and 
courts of arbitration, will suffice to prevent the 
outbreak of war ; and he supports his statements 
with an abundance of historical evidence to show 
that the above mentioned methods have in the past 
failed to achieve this end. In Chapter I. of Book II. 
the author strikes the keynote of his argument. It 
is his claim that the prime cause of war in modern 
times is no longer religious or ethnographic differ- 
ences, but trade rivalry, which has led to modern 
tariffs, these imposts being the chief cause of 
international irritation. The administration of 
tariff?, the author endeavors to show, differs in no 
material respect from the preliminaries to war.

influenced by Henry George, and one of his best 
chapters is little more than a re-statement of Henry 
George's doctrine contained in "Protection and 
Free Trade." He is also much influenced by Leroy- 
Beaulieu, but claims that the great French econo- 
mist has not dared to go the whole way in his 
advocacy of a universal market and absolute free- 
trade. Freedom of trade and freedom of migration, 
says M. Anitchkow, would remove the only causes 
of contemporary antagonism. The safety of foreign 
investments would thus be guaranteed, for the 
cause of jealousy would be removed. The third 
part of the book seems to have little relation to 
what has gone before. It consists in the main of 
loosely constructed arguments for freedom in in- 
dustry, technical education, industrial cooperation, 
government ownership of railways, etc. The author 
wanders in a dreamy sort of fashion from one ideal 
to another, believing them all to be resultants of 
his proposed reforms, without stopping to indicate 
how these reforms are to realized, or why they are 

to be considered inevitable.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

Emperor ^ r - Sidney Whitman's " Life of the 

Frederick^ life Emperor Frederick " (Harper), ed- 
and character. ited f rom the Q erman o f Margaretha 

von Poschinger, appears simultaneously with the 
final instalment of the more voluminous original. 
Mr. Whitman has selected from Fratllein Posch- 
inger's mass of material such portions as seemed 
most likely to interest English readers, and he has 
eliminated so far as possible all second-hand com- 
ment and appreciation. The volume is thus in the 
main composed of conversations, letters, and per- 
sonalia of monarchs, soldiers, savants, statesmen, 
and men of letters, so arranged as to form an ac- 
count of the public and private life of the Emperor 
told in the words of witnesses able in most cases to 
speak directly to the facts. The inherent defects, 
as well as merits, of biography made on this plan 
are obvious ; and Mr. Whitman is at least to be 
credited with a very good piece of literary joiner- 
work, in which the materials are sound and well- 
chosen, and put together in a workmanlike way. It 
may be added that in many cases the documents so 
laboriously assembled by the pious care of Frattlein 
Poschinger have an interest of their own to which 
that which they owe to their bearing on the career 
or character of Emperor Frederick is secondary. 
The life of " Unser Fritz " was largely part and 
parcel of some of the most important phases of the 
history of his time ; his character was such as to 
gild with a ray of splendor what future history will 
probably regard as the declining day of European 
royalty of the old type. It may perhaps be urged 
that not absolutism but liberalism is heir to the 
lustre of his virtues ; that in many things he was at 
heart a generous apostate from the tradition of his 



race. It was a true instinct which led the people 
to regard him, not as a being of superior clay, but 
as ' Unser Fritz " our Fritz. An ardent cham- 
pion of tolerance, he opposed every exercise of ar- 
bitrary power ; a master of the military art, he 
abhorred war, and the laurels of victory turned to 
the cypress of mourning in his grasp. " I detest 
this butchery," he sadly remarked on the morrow 
of triumph ; " I have never longed for war laurels, 
and would willingly have left such fame to others 
without envying them." At once the people's choice 
and the representative of the hereditary principle, 
he was indeed "every inch a king." His mantle 
has scarcely fallen upon his bustling and eccentric 
successor who has, however, by no means fulfilled 
the unflattering expectations formed of him. Mr. 
Whitman's book is interesting and full of meat, and 
it is presentably got up. 

An excellent Mr - George Parker Winship^s 

bibliography " Cabot Bibliography " (Dodd) is 

of the Caboit. an exhaustive and scholarly piece of 
work. An introduction of some fifty pages gives a 
concise account of what is actually known about 
the Cabots. Mr. Winship has distinguished clearly 
between the historical value of strictly contemporary 
evidence and that of the later gossip of the histor- 
ians, whose personal acquaintance with Sebastian 
Cabot has blinded us to the carelessness and indi- 
rectness of their testimony. Upon the same prin- 
ciple, he has relegated the legends of the so-called 
" Cabot map " to a position of secondary importance, 
no certain connection between the map and the 
navigator having been established. The biblio- 
graphy proper consists of two parts, a list of 
early documents, books, and maps relating to the 
Cabots, and a list of the later books, articles, and 
addresses that have been printed about them, 
containing altogether nearly six hundred titles. 
The titles are supplemented by excellent explana- 
tory and critical notes, which constitute the chief 
value of the work. We have but one fault to find 
with the bibliography, and that respects its arrange- 
ment in alphabetical order. In our opinion a 
chronological order would have much better served 
the purpose of the lists. It would have disclosed 
the original material in the order of historical se- 
quence, and have distinguished more clearly its 
relative value. It would have grouped the later 
discussions around the successive storm centres of 
the Cabot controversy, and have developed natur- 
ally its origin and subsequent course. An index of 
names would then have rendered the whole easy of 
reference. As it is, the lists are somewhat bewil- 
dering and difficult to read. The order suggested 
would have made them easy and interesting an 
extraordinary thing for a bibliography. Probably 
it will be said that the book is not intended to be 
read, but it is certainly a distinct advantage to 
make a book readable, if it can be done. Mr. 
Winship's knowledge of Cabot sources and literature 
is so extensive, and his judgment so sound, that.it

would be a pity for him to rest with this work. 
Mr. Beazley gave us a good popular account of the 
Cabots, hat a definitive statement still remains to 
be written a book that shall be final as far as a 
book can be. Mr. Winship seems to have every 
qualification for writing such a book, and we trust 
that he has it in contemplation. 

The small volume by Dr. David F. 
Lincoln, entitled " Sanity of Mind" 
(Putnam), is one of those meritori- 
ous works which one is disposed to criticise rather 
harshly because it could so easily have been better. 
It contains good material, served rather indiffer- 
ently well and with no executive skill. It has an 
important and a timely message, and along with 
other works of its class, will serve a good purpose 
in acquainting the interested public with the general 
nature of some of the influences that make for 
mental health and disease. It brings the reader 
within speaking distance of mental abnormalities, 
and shows him how modern views of physiological 
and psychological functions may be applied in wise 
precept as well as in specific advice. The lesson 
of the volume is essentially practical ; its tone is 
educational and sociological. It considers the fac- 
tors of heredity and environment in the production 
of abnormally tending influences, and points out 
where the optimistic reformer may most effectively 
apply his philanthropic energies, and where the 
educator must be most actively upon his guard. It 
does this with moderate success, but not nearly so 
effectively as must be done before this type of ideas 
becomes absorbed into the thinking of the educated 
public. One of the points most successfully em- 
phasized is the value of activity in the cure and 
prevention of abnormal tendencies, not merely in 
extreme cases but in little ways. One is at once 
reminded of James's classic chapter on habit, when 
the author, in insisting upon the necessity that ac- 
quisition should leave a tangible deposit in action, 
says : " Probably the most insidious form of mental 
voluptuousness is the hearing of brilliant sermons 
and lectures." On the whole, one forms a more 
favorable impression of the author than of his 
book ; and yet any one interested in the spread of 
the point of view which Dr. Lincoln advocates, and 
sympathetic with his sound and practical purposes, 
will be glad to recommend the work as a step in 
the right direction. 

The awakened sense of nationalism, 
re8Qltin g in the struggles on every 
hand of subject peoples to cast off 
the yoke of their foreign oppressors, is, together 
with the concomitant spread of constitutionalism or 
democracy, the central fact of nineteenth -century 
political history. The names of the leading heroes 
in the several wars for national independence are. 
or should be, familiar ones to a generation which 
now seems in some danger of forgetting the prin- 
ciple in defence of which so much blood has been 



spilt the principle, namely, that every people, 
however small, which is fit for self-government, or 
is demonstrably well on the way to that fitness, is 
and of right ought to be free and independent," and 
unpreyed upon by the commercial greed or terri- 
torial ambition of its stronger neighbors. In a vol- 
ume of 328 pages, Mr. Edgar Sanderson tells in 
popular style the stories of leading " Hero-Patriots 
of the Nineteenth Century " (Crowell). Among 
the names inscribed on Mr. Sanderson's roll of 
honor are Diaz, Hofer, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Garibaldi, 
Kanaris, Abdel-Kader, Schamyl, Manin, Mazzini. 
Mr. Sanderson writes clearly and directly, avoiding 
the pitfalls of florid description and high-flown 
panegyric, and wisely letting the plain facts about 
his heroes speak for themselves. The narratives 
appear to be based on trustworthy sources of infor- 
mation. and the book is on the whole a good one 
for popular reading at a time when the popular 
mind needs a tonic that may serve to brace and 
fortify its sense of the claims and rights of aspiring 
nationalism. There are several portraits.

who desires a concise manual of the subject which 
will give a clear view of the entire field. The 
"Outlines of Human Physiology" (Holt), by Drs. 
Schenck and Gttrber of the Physiological Institute 
at Wttrzburg, aims to lay stress on the undisputed 
facts of the science without extended discussion of 
conflicting hypotheses. The authors' names are a 
sufficient guarantee that the contents have been 
well selected, with due regard to the latest investi- 
gations in the field of human physiology. Little 
attention is paid to the mechanism of experimental 
work in the laboratory, emphasis being laid upon 
the results of such work rather than upon the 
means by which they may be obtained. Dr. Zoe- 
thout's translation makes this very admirable work 
available for English readers. In the preface to 
the American edition Professor Loeb calls attention 
to the extension of physiological research to the 
invertebrates in the now developing science of ex- 
perimental morphology, and to the application of 
physical chemistry to physiological problems. The 
results of this work, though important in their bear- 
ing on the fundamental laws of life, have not as 
yet found their way into medical text-books. 

Mr. W. F. Apthorp has written for 
" The Music Lover's Library " 
(Scribner) what he calls a "com- 
pendious sketch " of " The Opera, Past and Pres- 
ent." The work is brief, but it serves well its pur- 
pose, and the author has embodied in his not 
numerous pages the result of much historical re- 
search, besides the experience of a veteran pro- 
fessional critic. He states the gist of the whole 
matter of operatic history when he says that opera 
was started on the right artistic road three hundred

years ago in Florence, that it soon got side-tracked 
from what should have been its true course, and 
that it was not until the mighty genius of Wagner 
appeared in the arena that the long struggle be- 
tween artistic and inartistic principles was ended. 
Even the powerful influence of Gluck could not 
avail to restore the lyrical drama to its own, although 
after Gluck's epoch-making activity it was only a 
question of time when the triumph of art over 
patchwork should be secure. We do not always 
agree with Mr. Apthorp's estimates of particular 
composers and works, but his judgment is usually 
well-fortified, and deserving of respect. A more 
serious criticism must be directed toward his style, 
which is often marred by vulgarisms and examples 
of uncouth phraseology. 

Such a career as Mr. William T. 
The matter o/ the g tead describes in his Life of Mrs. 

Salvation Army. ,,. 

Booth (Revell) cannot fail to in- 
terest every lover of humanity and believer in its 
eventual salvation. Prefixed by a portrait of the 
good woman whose virtues it celebrates, the 
" mother " of the Salvation Army, this small vol- 
ume, appropriately clad in red, is much more than 
a mere recitation of events or catalogues of virtues. 
It contrives to return to this earth something of the 
personality with which Mrs. Booth once blessed it, 
making it a good book in much the sense in which 
she was a good woman satisfied when duty is 
done with no nonsense about it. Catherine Mum- 
ford was born in 1829 ; her father was a coach- 
builder, a keen politician, and a Methodist preacher, 
and her mother was a believer in the maxim, " If 
you wish to train a child do it yourself." In 1855 
she was married to William Booth, preacher. She 
was never in good health, but spent no time in 
complaints, bringing up a large family, and so fill- 
ing her days with labor that the amount of it can 
only be estimated in results. Mrs. Booth died in 
1890, deeply regretted, but leaving behind her an 
achievement which fully entitles her to Mr. Stead's 
title of " a Maker of Modern Britain." At times 
a little restraint or pruning of enthusiasm might 
have benefitted the work, but it is in earnest, and 
is interesting reading throughout. 

It requires treatment of an unusual 
kind to J U8tif y 80 ambitious a title 
as The Bird Book " (Heath), but 
Mrs. Fannie Hardy Eckstorm fairly earns her right 
to use it by the interesting and original work where- 
with she has enlivened the more customary knowl- 
edge included with it. It appears to be the design 
of the author to awaken in her readers the desire 
to open their eyes and see birds for themselves. To 
persuade them to alertness of vision she tells of the 
enchanting things she herself has been able to per- 
ceive with older and wiser eyes, of course, yet 
with no more skill than falls naturally to the lot of 
those who will do as they are bid. Some of the 
chapter titles show the inducements held forth for

observation. One is called " White Blackbirds and 
Other Freaks "; another, " How Birds are Named"; 
while a third takes up " The Three Great Prob- 
lems of Bird Life," which are defined to be " Food, 
Safety, and Reproduction." The engrossing topic 
of " Protection by Color " receives adequate con- 
sideration, with a most interesting statement of the 
" law of gradation," recently discovered, and the 
manner of its demonstration. The book is almost 
an encyclopaedia in its inclusiveness, but lacks the 
index which would make all its information readily 
available. 

Mrs. W. K. Clifford calls <The 
Likeness of the Night" ( Macmillan) 
" A Modern Play in Four Acts," 
and modern it is, at least in coming to a conclu- 
sion which is tragical to a 'human soul rather than 
to a human body. The play, with considerable 
modification, has been acted by Mr. and Mrs. 
Kendall, with Miss Madge M'Intosh as the heroine, 
and is to be placed on the Vienna stage in transla- 
tion, as we are informed by the little preface. As 
printed, the dialogue is bright, and in the manner 
of the modern English school; while the construc- 
tion of the play appears to owe its skill quite as 
much to the actors as to Mrs. Clifford's 'prentice 
hand. The theme is of the sort with which Mrs. 
Clifford has identified her writing generally. What 
seems least pleasant about it all is the insistence 
that convention, standing for race experience, car- 
ries with it immediate punishment for all lapses, 
taking the question away from morality as such, and 
leaving it a mere matter of social understanding.

and perhaps inspired, Robert Louis Stevenson, who 
could certainly have supped full of its horrors. 
The " Globe " was a Nantucket whaler which sailed 
in 1822 for the Pacific. During the voyage part 
of the crew mutinied, murdered their officers and 
some of their shipmates, and then set sail for the 
Mulgrave Islands, where they landed, and where 
all of them save Lay and Hussey were subsequently 
killed either by the natives or their own blood-crazed 
companions. The story is quaintly and circum-

tions of the Mulgrave Islanders.

fresher book of the kind is to be found than the one

detail, and an abundance of photographic plates 
adds much to the graphic quality of the text. 
Aside from its descriptive value the best thing 
about the book is the kindly and charitable spirit 
in which it is written. Mr. Goodenough plainly 
has little patience with the " unco guid " who are

Veronese, together with an introductory chapter 
descriptive of the rise of Venetian art, and the 
methods of its earlier exponents. The four leading 
essays present a judicious mingling of biographical 
essentials, criticism, and descriptive analysis of 
representative works. Mr. Stearns's studies evince 
a thorough acquaintance with the literature bearing 
on his subject, and his knowledge of technical 
processes appears to be superior to that generally 
possessed by the layman in art. On the whole his 
book is one which intelligent readers will appreciate 
for its scholarly independence of view and sugges- 
tive freshness of comment. Pictorially it seems to 
us to fall short of the requirements and deserts of 
the text, the half-dozen plates being of relatively 
poor quality. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

From the pictorial point of view Estelle M. Kuril's 
little handbook on Mnrillo, in the "Riverside Art 
Series " (Houghton), is very attractive, the seventeen 
full-page illustrations being both pleasing and repre- 
sentative in subject, and satisfactory mechanically. 
But Miss Kuril's " interpretations " sink too often to 
the level of mere prattle about the pictures and the 
pointing out of qualities too obvious to escape the eye 
of a child. The work, however, contains some useful 
tabulated matter, and it forms, at least, a charming 
picture-book. 

"National Legislation Concerning Education: Its 
Influence and Effect in the Public Land States East of 
the Mississippi River" (Columbia University Press), 
is a very instructive monograph by Mr. George B. Ger- 
mann, the same being a thesis for the degree of Doctor 
of Philosophy in Columbia University. The monograph 
indicates much painstaking research, is clearly written 
and logically arranged. It is announced as the fore- 
runner of a more exhaustive study along the same lines. 
This monograph gathers in compact form a very striking 
and valuable array of facts, and it ought, therefore, to 
prove of great interest to all students of education and 
sociology. 



NOTES. 



"The New Century Standard Letter- Writer," by 
Dr. Alfred B. Chambers, is a recent popular publication 
of Messrs. Laird & Lee. 

" Australasia: The Commonwealth and New Zea- 
land," by Mr. Arthur W. Jose, is a timely addition to

The " Introduction to Sociology," first published five 
years ago by Mr. Arthur Fairbanks, now appears in a 
revised edition (the third) from the press of the Messrs. 
Scribner. 

" The Government of Minnesota," by Dr. Frank L. 
McVey, is a convenient historical and constitutional

place in the " Library of English Classics " published 
by the Messrs. Macmillan. 

A new edition of Edgar Allan Poe's complete works, 
edited by Prof. James A. Karrison of the University of 
Virginia, and other Poe specialists, is announced by 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 

A new edition of the " Hudson " Shakespeare, one 
play to a volume, is in course of publication by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. "Macbeth" and "Julius Csesar" have 
just been received by us, each volume neatly bound in 
flexible leather covers. 

"Selections from the Prose Tales of Edgar Allan 
Poe " is a " Pocket Classic " published by the Macmil- 
lan Co. The text is that of the authoritative edition of 
Messrs. Stedman and Woodberry, which the publishers 
have courteously permitted to be used. 

"The Influence of the American Revolution upon 
German Literature " is an interesting study of an inter- 
esting subject by Professor James Taft Hatfield and 
Miss Elfrieda Hochbaum, reprinted in pamphlet form 
from the pages of " Americana Germanica." 

" Songs of Exile," translated from various Hebrew 
poets by Miss Nina Davis, is a small volume recently 
issued by the Jewish Publication Society of America. 
Both the Talmudic and the Midrashic literatures are 
represented, but the chief tribute is levied upon the 
poet Jehudah Halevi. 

"A Short Introduction to the Literature of the 
Bible," by Mr. Richard Green Monlton, is a recent pub- 
lication of Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. It is not an 
abridgment of the author's " Literary Study of the 
Bible," but an independent work, although the two 
books naturally have much in common. 

Mr. R. H. Russell publishes a volume of "Stage 
Lyrics," by Mr. Harry B. Smith. They are very famil- 
iar lyrics to the theatre-going public, for they are all 
taken from the author's librettos and musical comedies. 
The illustrations are character portraits of the popular 
stage favorites of the day, and are very numerous. 

The revelations of Sig. Benedetti concerning the man- 
agement of the Villa Giulia Museum, of which some 
account was given in THE DIAL three months ago, have

articles that have appeared upon this subject in Euro- 
pean and American journals. Condemnation of the 
methods employed in the management of the Museum 
in question appears to be general, and the pamphlet 
before us offers impressive testimony to this fact. 

The Macmillan Co. publish a new edition, practically 
unchanged as to text, of Professor Dean C.Worcester's 
work on "The Philippine Islands and Their People." 
Much water has flowed under the bridges since this 
work first appeared three years ago, but it remains one 
of the best accounts of land and people, from a scien- 
tific point of view, that we have. 

A volume of " Songs of All Colleges," compiled and 
arranged by Messrs. David B. Chamberlain and Karl P. 
Harrington, is a recent publication of Messrs. Hinds & 
Noble. This handsome quarto of over two hundred 
pages includes most of the old favorites, as well as 
many of the later successes for which one will search 
the old collections in vain. The book should prove 
widely popular. 

Mr. Herbert E. Walter and Alice Hall Walter have 
prepared a list of one hundred birds observed in Lin- 
coln Park, Chicago, during the Spring migrations, which 
they publish in the form of a small pamphlet entitled 
" Wild Birds in City Parks." It is intended to serve 
as a help in identifying these transient visitors, and con- 
tains many useful hints to that end. It may be obtained 
of Mr. F. C. Baker, Academy of Sciences, Chicago. 

" The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche," by Miss 
Grace Neal Dolsen, is an issue of the " Cornell Studies 
in Philosophy," and offers a fuller exposition than has 
hitherto been given in the English language of the 
writings of this vigorous and original thinker. The 
treatment is reasonably sympathetic, and the interest of 
the subject is so great that we predict for this essay a 
wider audience than is usually won by a technical philo- 
sophical monograph. 

The Baker & Taylor Co.'s Spring announcement list 
includes the following: "Mr. Chupes and Miss Jenny: 
The Life Story of Two Robins," by Effie Bignell; a 
revised edition of " With the Wild Flowers, from Pussy 
Willow to Thistledown," by Maud Going; "The Next 
Great Awakening," by Dr. Josiah Strong; " The Creed 
of Presbyterians," by Rev. Egbert Watson Smith; "My 
Master," by Swami Vivekananda; and " First Years in 
Handicraft," by Mr. Walter J. Kenyon. 

Professor Mark H. Liddell's " Chaucer," published 
by the Macmillan Co., is an -excellent text for school 
use. It includes the Prologue, " The Knightes Tale," 
and " The Nonne Prestes Tale," together with an ex- 
position of the principles of Middle English grammar 
and phonology, a glossary, and notes. Much has been 
done of late in Chaucer scholarship, and this book, which 
presents the results of the most recent investigation, is 
necessarily better than its predecessors, excellent as 
some of these were in their day. 

The " English Readings " published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. constitute one of the best series of anno- 
tated school texts that have ever been produced. The 
" Arnold " and " Newman " of Mr. Gates, the "Burke " 
of Mr. Perry, and the " Byron " of Dr. Carpenter are 
model books of their kind, and we can bestow a word of 
similar praise upon the " Swift," recently edited by Mr. 
F. C. Prescott. "Gulliver" and the "Journal to 
Stella " are not included in this volume, but the rest of 
Swift's prose writings are well represented, and the edito- 
rial apparatus is all that we could reasonably expect.

Three Books of Exceptional Interest 

BLUE SHIRT AND KHAKI by J. F. J. Archibald. A daring and truth- 

ful comparison between the Blue Shirts in Cuba and the Gentlemen in Khaki in South Africa, by one 
who witnessed closely both campaigns. The Officers, Soldiers, Strategy, Commissariat, and Transpor- 
tation of both armies are candidly discussed and exemplified. One hundred photographs of extraordinary 
beauty, taken by the author. 
// is the only comparison of the American and British armies ever published. (Ready in April.) $1.50. 

THE DUKE OF STOCKBRIDQE by Edward Bellamy. The strange 

Mutiny of the Yankee Farmers against the Aristocrats in 1786, called Shays' Rebellion, is the back- 
ground for this powerful story by the author of " Looking Backward." It is a romance of a Captain 
of the Continental Army and the leader of the Rebellion, who loved the superb and capricious belle of 
Western Massachusetts. Edward Bellamy's best work is here. In style, historic interest, startling 
reality, and delicious humor, it is a masterpiece. 
Mr. W. D. Htnvells rants it as the very first of our historical romances. $1.50. 

THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT WOOD by Charles G. D. Roberts. 

Powerful and unlike any other novel you ever read is this new romance of a Forest Maid, her Lover, 
and her Wild Animal friends, all working out their problem together. It is a book that will live. It 
is pure literature. " One of the most fascinating novels of recent days." Boston Herald. " Dainty 
and delicate as a wild rose ; a breath of the forest put into articulate speech ; unlike Kipling, unlike 
Seton-Thompson, better than either in several respects." Brooklyn Eagle. 
No other novel for years has bad such unanimous praise from critics and people. $1.50.

TANGLED FLAGS 

By ARCHIBALD C. QUNTER 

The Most Startling Novel of the Age 

"Mr. Gunter is a novelist of the people. He will retain 
his public as long as he tarns out such books as Tangled 
Flags." New York Mail and Express. 

" Tangled Flags is a book well worthy to begin the liter- 
ature of the New Century. Osuri Katsurua stands forth as 
strongly as any of Dumas's Heroes." The Literary News.

Balzac's Rival 



Balzac had no rival but George 
Sand ; some critics consider them 
twin stars. 

This woman, acknowledged by all the world 
as the second, if not the first, of French nov- 
elists, was certainly the most remarkable 
woman of her age, and the greatest authoress 
in the world's history. 

The story of her own life is as romantic and 
eventful as that of any of her heroines ; the 
revelations made in her Histoire de ma vie 
would furnish material for a dozen novels of 
the present day. An interesting pamphlet 
giving outline of her life will be sent on request.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A JOURNALIST 

By WILLIAM J. STILLMAN. With two Portraits. 2 vols. 8vo, gilt top, $6.00. 
A notable addition to the attractive volumes of biography and reminiscence which have 
lately appeared. It is one of the richest and fullest, for Mr. Stillman is one of the most 
picturesque characters of our time. It is a large and distinguished group of friends who 
figure in these volumes Bryant, Lowell, Emerson, Norton, Judge Hoar, Agassiz, Ruskin, 
the Rossettis, and Italians and Greeks of great distinction. Mr. Stillmau gives his exper- 
iences as U. S. Consul at Rome and in Crete, and as correspondent of the London Times. 

A SOLDIER OF VIRGINIA 

By BUKTON EGBERT STEVENSON. Illustrated. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
A strong historical romance of the time of Braddock's ill-fated expedition to Fort 
Duquesne. The hero is a soldier under Washington, and has a long experience of perils 
and hardships. A love-story is threaded throughout the narrative, which describes 
admirably the times, Washington, and a finely attractive hero and heroine. 

THE TURN OF THE ROAD 

A Romance. By EUGENIA BROOKS FROTHINGHAM. 12mo, $1.50. Fifth Printing. 

" One of the most delightful among new romances. The story of love versus musical ambitious is 
told with an unusual degree of interest, the characters standing forth with clearness and distinctness. The 
natural ease of the story-teller, the grace and swing of the narrative, the simple force of the details and 
the realistic emotional tone of the romance as the course of true love becomes more and more troubled, 
make this a most attractive volume. . . . Altogether it is a love story daintily and happily told, with the 
characters well suited to their parts and the play of incidents sufficiently interesting to hold the attention 
of the critical reader." Boston Herald. 

THE STORY OF EVA 

By WILL PAYNE, author of "The Money Captain," etc. 12mo, $1.50. (April 10.) 
This is a strong character story. It deals with social conditions not very uncommon, and treats them 
with distinct power and wisdom. The leading characters are a young man from the eastern part of the 
country and a young woman from Nebraska. They meet in Chicago, have various experiences, and finally 
a fire gives them a moral shock which is the beginning of a higher life. The story is strong in depicting 
the development of their characters up to their nobler selves. It has a powerful moral and is of high 
literary quality. 

ENGLISH POLITICS IN EARLY VIRGINIA HISTORY 

By ALEXANDER BROWN, author of " The Genesis of the United States," " The First 
Republic in America," "The Cabells and their Kin." 8vo, $2.00. (April 10.^) 
Another sheaf garnered by Mr. Brown from his assiduous and intelligent cultivation of the early his- 
tory of our country. It is a careful study of the sources of the American Government, and especially of 
the conditions under which the colonies established political institutions. This naturally involved a close 
study of the relation of English policies and politics to the colonies. It is a thoroughly scholarly piece of 
work, giving the results of careful investigation.

SCR1BNERS NEWEST BOOKS 



President SCHURMAN of Cornell University, who was 
President of the first Philippine Commission, writes of Mr. 
Sonnichsen's book : " As an illustration of the way in which 
the book takes hold of the reader I may say that I opened it first 
on a railway car, and I became so absorbed that I read it six 
hours, completely carried away by the story, unconscious of the 
surroundings, and almost oblivious to the end of my journey." 

The Outlook says : " This is a book to be read from cover 
to cover."

A Book of Delightful Humor 

THE ABANDONED FARMER < 

By SYDNEY HERMAN PRESTON 

Author of "The Green Pigs," " Our Two Uncles," etc. / 2/710, $1.25. 
A new book in the field which Mr. Stockton explored in " Rudder Grange," but which 
since then has been neglected. It describes, in a delicious vein of humor, the experiences of 
a young newspaper man and his wife and boy on a small farm which they leased near the 
city. No one who laughed over the adventures of the hero of Mr. Preston's " Green Pigs " 
need be assured of the rich humor or of the exceptional literary quality of this new book.

250 THE DIAL [April 16, 




A SUMMER HYMNAL. A Romance of Tennessee. By JOHN TROTWOOD 

MOORE. Illustrated by STANLEY M. ARTHURS. 12mo. Cloth extra. $1.25. 

Mr. Moore has much of the quality displayed by James Lane Allen in his earlier work, " A Kentucky 
Cardinal." The scene of his romance is laid in the blue-grass region of Tennessee, and his pages are rich 
with tender sentiment, shrewd philosophy, poetic feeling, and an exquisite humor. Those who have read 
his charming short story, " Ole Mistis," will warmly welcome his first novel, and new readers are sure to 
be delighted. "Old Wash," the negro character who figures in some of Mr. Moore's short stories, 
reappears in this book. 

THE TOWER OF WYE. A Romance. By WILLIAM HENRY BABCOCK. Illus- 
trated by GEORGE GIBBS. 12nao. Cloth extra. $1.50. 

This is a story of early Maryland colonial life, full of incident and interest. Mr. Babcock has, more 
artistically than any other writer, caught the atmosphere of haze and marvel through which newcomers

IN SEARCH OF MADEMOISELLE. By GEORGE GIBBS. Illustrated by the 
Author. 12 mo. Cloth extra, ornamental. $1.50. 

Mr. Gibbs the artist, in this his first novel, deals with the romantic and highly picturesque episode 
in American history of the struggle between the French and Spanish for the possession of Florida. This 
furnishes the background for a charming story of the love of an Englishman for Diane de la Notte, a 
French Huguenot of noble family, who has been exiled from her native land. 

CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY says: " Mr. George Gibbs has chosen the most romantic and terrible 
episode in the whole range of American colonial annals as the historical basis of his vivid romance. He 
writes as he paints, with graphic force and spirit." 

JOHN HABBERTON writes: "I've read your In Search of Mademoiselle' with great interest. 
I must congratulate you on your success in retaining throughout the novel the old-time atmosphere in 
which you began. No writer of historical novels has done this better than you; few have done it so well."

LIBRARY EDITION. 

TWO MEN. TEMPLE HOUSE. THE MORGESONS. 12, with photo- 

gravure portraits. Each, $1.50. 

" They are essentially modern and in keeping with the choicest types of recent fiction . . . the 
pioneers of something new and real in the novelist's art. Mrs. Stoddard's novels appeal to us through 
a quality of their own. Style, insight, originality, make books like ' Two Men ' and < Temple House ' 
additions not merely to the bulk of reading, but to literature itself." Edmund Clarence Stedman. 

DEAR DAYS. A Story of Washington School Life. By ARMOUR STRONG. 

Illustrated. 12 mo. Cloth extra. $1.00. 

A book for girls, told in an unusually fresh, natural way; and with the local color connected with the 
Nation's Capitol. The author knows Washington thoroughly, and it will be of profit, as well as interest, 
to children all over the country to obtain glimpses of life in the political centre of the United States. 
The school-girls of the story act, and talk, as real children do, in a very natural and attractive way. 

THE KING'S RUBIES. A Story for Boys and Girls. By ADELAIDE FULLER 

BELL. Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, ornamental. $1.00. 

$"** A charming story woven around the romance of " The King's Rubies," and how they came to America. 
Girls, and boys, too, will like the healthy, natural children who figure in the book, and the idiosyncracies 
of " Mose," the old negro character, will be found very amusing. The book is wholesome, strong in 
incident, and written in excellent style.

THE COLUMN 

By CHARLES MARRIOTT. $1.50. 

Of this remarkable story two opinions are just to hand. 

SENATOR JOHN M. THURSTON: 

" / have read no story of modern times which so completely demanded my undivided attention 
from the beginning to the end as 'The Column? by Charles Marriott. It is a striking, and, as 
it seems to me, a faithful delineation of the strongest and yet most natural characters. The 
language is chaste and refined, the dramatic interest intense, the plot powerful, and the whole 
work cleanly and brilliantly intellectual. It is sure to take high rank in the literature of the day" 

MR. JULIAN HAWTHORNE 

in THE NORTH AMERICAN: 

" Marriott, taken as an alternative after other literary forms, is deeply welcome and full of 
wholesome exercise and succulence. He paces up and down, as it were, in a hall where all is 
harmonious and proudly beautiful, even fastidious. . . . It is a book full of repose, even in its 
passion ; and it is everywhere rich in beauty. . . . Mr. Marriott comes among us a stranger and 
an alien; but he is welcome, for he brings with him a beauty which lifts and purifies the mind."

and an extended Bibliographical Sketch by W. DAWSON JOHNSTON. 
THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND, in five octavo volumes, with a full index, $10.00. 
ESSAYS, in three octavo volumes, with an index, $6.00. 

MISCELLANIES, including Speeches, Letters, and Poems, in two octavo volumes, with an

This edition of Lord Maeaulay's Works will appeal strongly to readers who wish his writings in thor- 
oughly handsome library volumes, edited with scholarly care and skill. The volumes are printed from 
large, beautifully clear type on paper of high quality, and bound in simple but handsome library style. 
Each of the volumes has a fine frontispiece portrait, the ten including two of Macaulay and eight of great 
persons who figure in Maeaulay's pages. It is difficult to see what more could be done to render this 
Cambridge Edition of Macaulay complete, attractive, and every way satisfactory. 

UNDER THE REDWOODS 

By BRET HARTE. 16mo, $1.25. 

Is there a better story-teller living than Bret Harte? He has told many scores of incomparable tales, 
and here are nine more, breezy, genial, strong, full of the vast and venturesome West. 

Mr. Harte adds to the nine stories a chapter of genuine and picturesque autobiography, entitled 
" Bohemian Days in San Francisco," which lends a peculiar and personal interest to this book. 

THE SUCCESSORS OF MARY THE FIRST 

By ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS, author of " The Gates Ajar," " A Singular Life," etc. 

Illustrated. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 

An entertaining story of the experiences of a family in a New England suburban town with their 
servants. There was a fine variety of these, of several nationalities, all degrees of ignorance and shades 
of incompetence. The story is thoroughly interesting and well illustrated. 

PENELOPE'S EXPERIENCES IN IRELAND 

By KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN, author of " Penelope's Progress," " The Birds' Christmas 

Carol," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

Penelope and her companions, Francesca and Salemina, go through Ireland, as before they went 
through England and Scotland, and find at every turn of the road occasions for merriment, and find also 
hospitality, cheerfulness, and beautiful scenery. The story is full of entertainment, and of Mrs. Wiggiu's 
irresistible humor. 

MISS PRITCHARD'S WEDDING TRIP 

By CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM. 12 mo, $1.50. 

Miss Pritchard loved a man who married another woman, and who, dying, left a daughter in the care 
of Miss Pritchard. This daughter strongly resembled her father, so that when Miss Pritchard took her to 
Europe she felt as if she were taking the wedding trip of which she had dreamed years before. The story 
is entertainingly told, and there is a Burnham romance in it. 

THE STORY OF EVA 

By WILL PAYNE, author of "The Money Captain," etc. 12mo, $1.50. 

This is a strong character story. It deals with social conditions somewhat uncommon, and treats 
them with distinct power and wisdom. The leading characters are a young man from the eastern part 
of the country and a woman from Nebraska. They meet in Chicago, have various experiences, and finally 
a fire gives them a moral shock which is the beginning of a higher life. The story is strong in depicting 
the development of their characters up to their nobler selves. It has a powerful moral and is of high 
literary quality.

SOME NOTABLE BOOKS 



X FOUNDATIONS OP ROTANV Bv J SKPH Y - BERGEN, Instructor in Biology in the English High School, 
O I \J\jnut\ I 1VJM.3 Vfl UUlrllll Boston, and Author of "Elements of Botany." For introduction, $1.50. 
Another notable book by Mr. Bergen, whose " Elements of Botany " has come to be tha most widely used recent text-book on the subject in 
higher schools and academies. It is intended not to take the place of the " Elements," but to offer a more extended and comprehensive course for 
schools that wish to devote an entire year to the subject. The flora includes seven hundred species. The descriptions are written in the very 
simplest language consistent with accuracy, and technical terms are omitted in every case where ordinary language is sufficiently concise and 
accurate to answer the purpose. 

THE THOUGHT READER 

Book I. 

By MAUD SUMMERS, Principal of the 
Goethe School, Chicago, 111. Illustrated. 
For introduction, 30 cents. 
The " Thought Reader " recognizes the 
thought as the reality, and the sentence as its 
outward expression. The material for thought 
is developed along three lines, action sen- 
tences, games, and stories. The relation of 
muscular movement to thought is now gener- 
ally recognized. This fact explains why action 
sentences should be used in the process of 
learning to read. The child's play interest has 
been correlated with his school work by means 
of games. Since these so thoroughly engross 
the child's attention, they furnish excellent 
material for reading lessons. The stories are 
based upon the thoughts and emotions which 
are intimately related to the child's experience. 



FIRST STUDIES OF 
PLANT LIFE 

(Ready in April) 

By GEORGE FRANCIS ATKINSON, Profes- 
sor of Botany in Cornell University, Ithaca, 
New York. 

In this new book by Professor Atkinson is 
presented the really unusual and attractive 
combination of high scholarship with a rare 
felicity in writing for young people. 

The object in presenting these studies has 
been to interest the child and pupil in the life 
and work of plants. Part IV., " Life Stories 
of Plants," the author has presented in the 
form of biographies. It suggests that biog- 
raphies from the plants themselves are to be 
read by the pupils. In fact, this feature of 
"reading" the stories which plants have to 
tell forms the leading theme which runs 
through the book. 



THE MOTHER TONGUE 

By GEORGE LYMAN KITTREDGE, Profes- 
sor of English in Harvard University, and 
SARAH LOUISE ARNOLD, Supervisor of 
Schools, Boston. Book I., Lessons in Speak- 
ing, Reading, and Writing English. For 
introduction, 45 cents. Book II., An 
Elementary English Grammar. For intro- 
duction, 60 cents. 

These books are a definite return from the 
formal and artificial methods pursued by other 
language books to the simple and natural 
methods followed by every child in acquiring 
its ability to speak, to read, and to write cor- 
rectly the English language. The wide expe- 
rience and scholarship of the authors render 
these books notable among all language books 
now published.

The book is intended for beginners and to be preliminary to a more thorough study in the higher grammar grades. The aim has been to 
interest boys and girls, and to avoid a mere compilation of facts. The subject has been approached through biographical sketches, exceptional 
deeds of valor, details of everyday life in olden times, dramatic episodes, and personal incident.

THE EVOLUTION OF IMMORTALITY 

By the Rev. SAMUEL D. McCONNELL. Cloth, 12mo, $1.25. Just Ready. 

"As some, but not all, animals have qualities that approach the human, so some people are immortal, but not a//," 
says Dr. McCONNELL. His theory that immortality is the final result of the survival of the fittest, the highest step 
in a long chain of evolution, is thoroughly in unison with biological truth. It is a stimulating book, since it offers 
immortality as something to be achieved by personal effort instead of as common to all men without power to choose 
or to reject.

A DIFFICULTY OF SYMPATHY. 

The man of advancing years, who has kept 
his intellectual outlook undimmed, and who 
has escaped the apathy that so frequently en- 
velopes the soul when the meridian of life is 
left behind, suffers no little perplexity when 
he seeks to enter into the consciousness of the 
new generation that is growing up about him. 
He feels that the ideals pursued by the finer 
spirits of the race are still the ideals to whose 
pursuit his own early years were given, but the 
books which serve these ideals as vehicles seem 
somehow to elude his sympathies ; his most 
penetrative scrutiny cannot find in them the 
same sustenance that was provided by the 
books read in his own youth, his most insistent 
questioning cannot evoke from them the same 
response. The literature of ideas, and to a 
certain extent the literature of artistic form, 
seems to such an observer to have undergone 
a process of subtle deterioration, and the in- 
tellectual influences of the vanished past seem 
to have been replaced by influences less potent 
than those of old to touch to fine issues the 
human spirit. He finds it almost impossible 
to realize that the books which appeal most 
strongly to the rising generation do in truth 
embody a message essentially the same as that 
which came to him a generation before clothed 
in far different modes of phrasing. The ex- 
pression of the new writings has been so shaped 
by the form and pressure of the new time that 
such a reader feels sadly old-fashioned in its 
presence, and shrinks from the contact to bury 
himself once more in the writings upon which 
his own soul has fed ever since the impression- 
able time when it was first awakened by their 
call. What he forgets is that the years that 
bring the philosophic mind bring also the crit- 
ical habit, and that no one can make a really 
fair comparison between the books that were 
read at twenty and those that are read at forty 
or fifty. 

There are few of us, however, who are suf- 
ficiently broad-minded to recognize, to the ex- 
tent of all its implications, the fact that every 
generation is bound to receive its most effective 
and vital guidance from the leaders of its own 
ranks. Some few books there are, of course, 



256 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



that never grow old the bibles, the philoso- 
phies, and the great poems. But books of the 
secondary order lose their influence after a few 
years, because all such books are derivative in 
character, and cannot share in the immortality 
of creative work. This is the truth which we 
fail to grasp when we find the younger men 
growing up about us taking scant heed of the 
masters of our own youth, and serving what 
are apt to seem to us false gods. We find 
ourselves out of touch with the strange new 
prophets who are gaining so great a following* 
Their soothsayings perplex and bewilder us, 
for they put things in unaccustomed ways, and 
we think that the ways long familiar to our 
own thought are the clearest, and should suffice 
those who come after us. It is the old wine, 
no doubt, but the bottles have been renewed, 
and the taste seems different. 

What we have just been saying is illustrated 
by Count Tolstoy's recent response to the re- 
quest that he send a message to the American 
people. " If I had to address the American 
people, I should like to thank them for the 
great help I have received from their writers 
who flourished about the fifties. I would men- 
tion Garrison, Parker, Emerson, Ballou, and 
Thoreau, not as the greatest, but as those who, 
I think, specially influenced me. Other names 
are Channing, Whittier, Lowell, Walt Whit- 
man a bright constellation, such as is rarely 
to be found in the literatures of the world. 
And I should like to ask the American people 
why they do not pay more attention to these 
voices, and continue the good work in which 
they made such hopeful progress." How far 
away from us this voice seems, in time as well 
as in space. Two or three of these names still 
mean something in vital power to the younger 
generation, but the others have become merely 
historical. What young man would now think 
of turning to Ballou or Channing or Parker 
for help in shaping his ideals of thought and 
conduct? But the sender of this message is 
himself a powerful factor in the new idealism, 
and the thought of the older men to whom he 
acknowledges grateful indebtedness has again 
become a living force in his burning appeal to 
our better instincts. 

There seems to be no help for it. " The old 
order changeth, giving place to new," not only 
in our material and social environment, but in 
our spiritual existence as well. Yet in the 
latter sphere as in the former the change is in 
the accidental, not the essential order. The 
physical world remains the same, and human 



nature remains the same, and truth, beauty, 
and goodness remain the same, if we only con- 
trive to view them sub specie ceternitatis. The 
new order of thought is nothing more than a 
new way of stating old truth, and with every 
new form of statement, there comes a better 
illumination ; we see more clearly into the dark 
corners, and we catch the gleam of facets which 
we did not before suspect to exist. The mind 
that has stiffened into particular modes of ex- 
pression misses much that is suggestive and 
inspiring in the restless movement of contem- 
porary thought. There is no possession more 
desirable than the plasticity of mind that can 
adapt itself to new forms, and take fresh im- 
pressions year after year. The retention of 
this susceptibility is chiefly a matter of the 
will, and the man who succeeds in retaining it 
is much more to be envied than the man who 
allows his sympathies to become atrophied, 
withdrawing himself from the present into the 
past, and cutting himself off from participation 
in the spiritual progress of the race. 



A DASH INTO AESTHETIC. 

To meddle with theories of art is a good deal 
like making an excursion into the Arctic regions 
with a purpose of reaching the ultimate North. We 
must carry our provisions with us and expect a 
scarcity of human society. But the mystery entices 
and the desire to completely account for things 
urges on explorers in both cases. To change the 
figure, the problems of aesthetic bear the same rela- 
tion to artistic products as do the mathematical 
solutions of strategetics to actual warfare. Wars 
may be waged, and poems and pictures made with- 
out conscious use of such underlying principles. 
But they are there and they determine the results. 
In the modern world, at least, artists have usually 
known what they were doing, and why. Goethe 
indeed said that he had never thought about think- 
ing, but there are many volumes of his art specula- 
tions to contradict him. 

The great problem of aesthetic is this: What is 
the relation of art to existence ? Is it an imitation ? 
Is it an interpretation? Is it something added? Is 
it a carryall of utility and morals ? Is it the univer- 
sal filtered through the human mind? Is it the 
particulars of experience arranging themselves into 
a new order of life ? On our answers to such ques- 
tions depend our judgment of individual works of 
art. 

The two great philosophers of Greece gave a 
curiously different account of the origin and value 
of art. To Plato, himself a poet, artist, and creator 
of vital figures, art, or at least poetry, was a delud- 
ing lamp to men's eyes and a snare to their feet !

It was inferior to shoemaking ! It was a poor copy 
of the world which was itself only a paltry shadow 
of the Divine Ideas. Like Omar he would have 
burned all books, because if they resembled life 
they were unnecessary, and if they did not they 
were false. To Aristotle, on the other hand, crabbed 
logician, natural philosopher, Baconian before 
Bacon as he was, art was the concentrated image 
of the best of real existence. He thought it could 
react in a moralistic way on man, and purify and 
exalt him. Hence he considered it about the highest 
and most important human concern. 

The word aesthetic is only of late application to 
the theory of the fine arts, and it is defined as the 
philosophy of the beautiful. As the Greek word 
from which it comes primarily means feeling or 
sensation, the narrowing of the derived term to sig- 
nify matters of beauty is rather singular, more 
especially as it was first so used during the romantic 
outburst of the last century. Certainly other things 
than the beautiful can give us feelings and sensa- 
tions even pleasurable ones. The ideal of Greek 
art may have been the regular, the harmonious, the 
perfect ; but even in Greek art what a wide range 
of creations, gorgons hydras and chimaeras dire, 
fell outside the limits of this ideal. Unless we can 
accept such conceptions as the perfection of horror, 
the delight fulness of the ugly, and the fascination 
of evil, we cannot even explain Greek art. And 
Gothic or Romantic art may be said to wreak itself 
on the outre, the extravagant, the impossible, and 
the humanly imperfect. Modern or realistic art, 
rebelling from the abstract perfection of the Greek 
and the abstract imperfection of the Mediaeval 
Schools, has striven to be simply true. But truth 
without bias or selection is in art an impossibility 
and so what modern art has really done is to 
copy life in lower relief than it has itself. The 
commonplace good has become .the insipid and the 
commonplace evil has become the base. Both are 
wanting in the greatness with which the older 
schools of art endow them. But what I wish to 
remark is that beauty is not really the aim of any 
of these art methods. What the first two strive for 
is the characteristic, the significant, the effective. 
"What the last thinks it is striving for is truth. As 
men are constituted I believe that their emotions 
and intellect tend to stagnate and stiffen, and that 
art is the most powerful agency to shock or startle 
them into motion, and make them realize the full- 
ness and vividness of existence. Things of beauty 
administer these shocks in rhythmical and harmoni- 
ous order, and so they charm. Things of power 
give them with sudden impetus and uncertain 
breaks, and so they fascinate. The great artists of 
the world wield both kinds of electricity. JEschylus 
is as romantic as Shakespeare and Shakespeare as 
classic as JEschylus. But the artist who deals in 
the commonplace and the inanely true does not 
yield us any shock at all, for his art is the essence 
of the stagnation in which we mainly dwell. 

As I have said, Plato and Aristotle view art 



mainly from a moralistic standpoint. We moderns 
have tried to change all that. We have looked 
through the rose-colored spectacles of beauty and 
the reversed opera glass of intellectual indifference, 
but after all the thing we are regarding will not 
budge or alter. Art does deal overwhelmingly with 
moral ideas, deals with them as life itself deals with 
them for or against. Roughly speaking the gen- 
erations of the sons of men can be divided into 
generations of acquiescence and generations of re- 
volt. When authority is paramount, when the 
great issues of thought seem settled, when every- 
body is content with that station in life in which it 
pleased God he should be born, then we get a lit- 
erature like that of Cow per and Jane Austen. 
When the great deep of humanity is broken up 
and the whirlwind is abroad, we get an art like 
that of Byron. We have late instances of these 
arts of peace and war. For half a century Tenny- 
son charmed the world with his serene or but 
slightly troubled verse. He gave us what has been 
called the clerical idyll ; he announced the banns 
of quasi-science and the Established Church. He 
was the Defender of Conservatism. "Proputty, 
proputty, propntty, that 's what I 'ears him say." 
But discontent was stirring at his mild moralities 
and domestic virtues. And this discontent has 
drawn to a head in the prodigious vogue of Fitz- 
gerald's Omar. A good many people have won- 
dered at this vogue. Mere literary beauty does 
not explain it. Literary beauty never did explain 
any widespread popularity. Gray was half right 
when he said that the Elegy would have been just as 
popular if written in prose. But the Persian poem 
has matter in it. It is an expression of revolt. Not 
of violent revolt like that of Byron's, but deep and 
hopeless. It is the doctrine of God damn. The ship 
of the world is sinking, so let's get at the liquor 
room ! It has seized upon and temporarily satisfied 
the needs of thinking minds. I do not wish to say 
that literary expression always follows or precedes 
a general mood of thought. That is Taine's rather 
cast-iron theory. No ! Solitary voices for good or 
evil are always crying aloud in the world. Bat the 
measure of their acceptance is the mark of the tides 
of thought. The supreme artists, indeed, sum up 
both sides, and usually find some way of recon- 
ciliation. 

I have gone over two parts of the content of art 
images and morality. There is, I think, a third 
intellectual intuition. Or, in other words, art re- 
lates itself to concrete nature, or action, to the moral 
life, or character, and to the pure intellect. These 
three divisions correspond to the old names for the 
poet. He has been called the Maker, the Priest, 
and the Seer. In its highest reaches art is nothing 
less than revelation. The poet has gone up into 
the mountain and seen God. To speak in terms of 
philosophy, he has pierced beyond the phenomena 
of existence to the noumena to the thing in itself. 
And hence he sheds on mere phenomena a splendor 
and a radiance which is not their own.

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



So far for the subject matter of art. Now for 
its presentation. What is artistic perfection ? This 
is a somewhat analogous question to that of finish 
in painting, about which Raskin has written some 
final pages. But a great many people who are 
willing to admit that the proper finish for a picture 
is the amount adequate to express the artist's pur- 
pose, hesitate to carry the same principle into the 
consideration of literature. They expect an epic to 
have the faultlessness of a sonnet and a drama to 
be always on its best behavior and avoid low ways. 
The good Homer must never nod. Byron very 
sensibly said that there was no long poem in ex- 
istence the half of which was good. Of course he 
meant supremely good. Perfection itself is a matter 
of relatively and contrast. Where all is perfect 
nothing is known to be so. Mr. Palgrave remarks 
in one of his journals : " How unequally a vral 
dire is Hamlet written." That is the judgment of 
a lyric technician. And John Bright is said to 
have revolted at the changes of style in Shake- 
speare the alternation of high and low, the ad- 
mission of the humorous and the vulgar, and to 
have considered Milton the greater poet because of 
the unvarying level of his work. Milton's dignity 
comes largely from his subject, and when he has 
to deal with familiar facts in polysyllables there is 
in him at least a suspicion of that pomposity of 
which Wordsworth was to be the awful example 
" And at the Hoop alighted, famous inn." Homer 
certainly varies his manner. He does not attempt 
to give to Ajax and Diomede dining off of huge 
shins of beef the same splendor that he casts upon 
Apollo striding through the sky with the arrows 
rattling in the quiver on his back, or upon Achilles 
raising the grief-stricken Priam from the ground. 
And Dante, too, relaxes the tight-strung bow of 
language, again and again. In the Inferno there 
is vulgarity, coarseness, bestiality. And in the 
Paradiso he is so intent upon his argument that he 
forgets to write poetry at all. The most pervad- 
ingly elegant and in the ordinary sense poetic part 
of his poem is the middle section. Here he does 
not have to deal with the powers of darkness or the 
domain of the brute, nor does he soar into regions 
where ecstasy is tuned to utterance beyond human 
recognition and so he can be equable and pure 
and perfect. But he is greatest elsewhere. Neces- 
sarily it is in the drama that the contest between 
the varied content of reality and an even ideal 
presentation is the sharpest. The old French tragic 
poets cut the question short by deciding that life 
must conform to art, that Queens, confidants, heroes, 
and servants must all talk in the same elegant and 
elevated strain, and passion and desolation and 
death wear the chains of an equal etiquette. Goethe 
in his later years came to adhere to this method 
under the persuasion that he was following the 
Greeks. The poet who gave us Auerbach's cellar 
and the domestic scenes in Egmont tried to turn 
Romeo and Juliet into a perfect piece on this model. 
He smoothed out all the vulgarities and colloquial- 



isms, and made it as prettily insipid as a wool lamb. 
Fortunately we have in Shakespeare the ultimate 
power in the art of unity in contrast. He gives us 
just enough of commonness and coarseness to be a 
foil to his nobleness and perfection. What poems 
in the world are so bathed and fused in a single 
atmosphere as The Tempest or Twelfth Night, 
Borneo and Juliet or Macbeth. 

And this brings me to my conclusion. I have 
questioned, tentatively indeed, the theory that would 
limit art to the beautiful. And indeed, its most 
powerful elements are such as, taken separately, 
horrify and terrorize and confuse. But in good art 
they never are taken separately. The artist leagues 
together his beauty and his ugliness, his shadows 
and his lights, his melodies and his discords, and 
gives us a whole which is calm in all its agitation. 
In it pain has become painless, evil innocuous, death 
immortal, and the transitory figures of joy and 
beauty are fixed in faultless form and unfading color.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



MISLEADING LIBRARY STATISTICS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

While library workers are gratified at the increased 
attention given library work and use, by students, critics, 
and writers, believing that, as a result of any public 
agitation, additional knowledge of these institutions 
will bring increased opportunities for good, they cannot 
but object to the plan which seems to be so generally 
adopted, of measuring the work accomplished by the 
percentage of the different classes of books issued for 
home use. Writers in recent publications take the 
" home use statistics " of a number of prominent libra- 
ries, and because they find, from the circulation tables, 
that an average of three-fourths of the volumes so 
issued are classed under the heading of fiction, argue 
that it is questionable whether the public library is 
really a good thing for a community. 

It is unfortunate, perhaps, that library reports do 
not give the exact " quality " of fiction circulated; that 
they do not say whether the library is closely classified 
or not; whether a great many or a few titles are placed 
in fiction which properly belong in other classes; 
whether juvenile fiction is placed under fiction pure and 
simple, or is reported under the general heading " ju- 
venile books"; for without this information, and a few 
other things which will be here referred to, no one can 
accurately judge of the work being done by any given 
library. 

The main point, however, is the injustice done the 
library by the attempt to measure its value to a com- 
munity solely by the books issued for home reading. 
A visit to any library of considerable size will reveal 
the fact that most of the real work is done in the library 
rooms; that for every book other than fiction taken 
home, from eight to fifteen will be used in the building; 
and that in certain seasons, and especially in educational 
centres, this proportion will be largely increased. This 
is true especially of the library small in comparison 
with the population of the city in which it is located 



1901.]

and with limited means this latter a condition all bat 
chronic west of the Allegheny mountains. A large 
proportion of this use of books in the library is com- 
pulsory (if they are to be used at all), for various rea- 
sons, chief among which is the inability of the library 
to supply a sufficient number of copies of a given book 
or to provide enough other works upon the same sub- 
ject to meet a large but temporary demand. For in- 
stance, a study club with an extensive membership, or 
a high school or college class, is given a subject to look 
up, with references to comparatively few volumes. The 
library could increase the " home circulation " of books 
other than fiction by issuing these few volumes to the 
first comers of either the club or the class, while the 
other, for various reasons, later applicants at the library 
would be deprived of the use of any of them. The 
rule in most of these libraries, in these emergencies, is 
to reserve these volumes for use in the library, on the 
basis of " the greatest good for the greatest number." 
With a number of such clubs and classes, one may 
readily see how a library could change its circulation 
statistics if it would. Again, these libraries, unable to 
purchase more than one copy of valuable works or one 
set of periodicals, place them in the reference room for 
use in the library exclusively, where no record is kept 
of their use, these rooms and shelves usually being open 
to the public. Here at times they have a wonderfully 
extensive use. 

Thus, a library of 25,000 volumes in a city of 100,000 
inhabitants may be doing a large amount of commend- 
able work, of lasting value to a community, while its 
published statistics may show a " home use " of more 
than 80 per cent fiction. Another library of 75,000 
volumes in a similar city may not be doing any better 
work, yet its home circulation may be but 60 per cent 
fiction, or less. 

Figures are often more than misleading, but in noth- 
ing else so much as in so-called " library statistics."

"LIBRARY PRIVILEGES FOR RURAL DISTRICTS." 

A FINAL WORD. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. I 

In your issue of March 16, there appeared from the 
pen of Mr. A. L. Day a short letter which gave me 
three addresses I might write to and gain further in- 
formation on the subject of county libraries. In your 
issue of April 1, Mr. W. T. Porter has a letter advanc- 
ing the claim of the Cincinnati Library to priority in 
the matter of inaugurating the county library move- 
ment. Since reading these two letters, and collecting 
all available data, I still remain by my statement in 
my letter in THE DIAL of January 16 that the Brum- 
back Library of Van Wert County, Ohio, is America's 
first real county library. 

The Xorris Jewett Library, to which Mr. Day re- 
ferred in his letter, is far from being a county library. 
The latest catalogue, which lies before me, makes the 
simple statement that the Norris Jewett Library is a 
library whose privileges are extended to all the resi- 
dents of Grundy County, Mo. No law makes it a 
county library, no county tax supports it, and no sys- 
tem of branch libraries has been put into operation by it. 

It will take a little more space to show that the Cin- 
cinnati Library is likewise, strictly speaking, hardly a 



county library. Granting, however, that it is a county 
library, let me briefly consider the act that created it a 
county library as well as the act that created the Brnm- 
back Library of Van Wert County a county library. 

Library BUI of the Cincin- I Library Bill of the Brum- 
nti Library. House Bill No. back Library of Van Wert 
753. In the House : April 1, County. Senate Bill No. 435. 
1898, Introduced ; April 15, In the Senate : March 25, 
1898, passed. In the Senate : 1898, Introduced ; April 14, 
April 15, 1898, Introduced ; 1898, Passed. In the House : 
April 21, 1898, Passed. April 15, 1898, Introduced ; 

April 26, 1898, Passed. 

We thus see that the bill of the Brumback Library 
of Van Wert County was introduced first, and passed 
the senate before the bill of the Cincinnati Library 
passed either the senate or the house. In this connection 
I should like to add that the bill of the Brumback 
Library was published in four or five of Ohio's leading 
papers nearly two months before the bill of the Cincin- 
nati Library was introduced in the Ohio legislature. 
See, for example, " The Commercial Tribune " of Cin- 
cinnati, for Feb. 13, 1898. 

I have given a brief history of the two bills. Let 
me next say a word regarding their contents. Again 
I will place my facts side by side. 

Bill of the Cincinnati Li- Bill of the Brumback Li- 

brary. (1) Called a special brary of Van Wert County, 
act, since it applies practic- 
ally only to the Cincinnati 
Library. (2) Tax is levied 
on the county, not by county 
officials, but by trustees of 
the library. (3) Phrase 
"county library" does not 
appear in the bill. 

From the preceding facts we see that, strictly speak- 
ing, the Cincinnati act does not create a county library. 
It simply extends the privileges of the Cincinnati Li- 
brary to Hamilton County. The fact is, the Cincinnati 
Library is more like the libraries in several of our 
larger cities, which have elaborate systems of branch 
libraries, than a county library in a county with a rural 
population, since the corporate limits of Cincinnati are 
almost coextensive with the lines of Hamilton County. 

What Mr. Porter says regarding the Cincinnati Li- 
brary having been put into operation first is all true. 
The Brumback Library had to be built after the passage 
of its act. The Cincinnati Library was already built. 
The only claim made by the Brumback Library of Van 
Wert County is that it teas the first to inaugurate the 
county library movement. j; j_ ANTRIM. 

Van Wert, Ohio, April S, 1901. 



(1) Called a general act, since 
it applies to all Ohio's conn- 
ties. (2) Tax levied on the 
county by county officials 
(commissioners). (3) Phrase 
"county library" does ap- 
pear in the bill. 



THE first publication of the Bibliographical Society 
of Chicago is a chronological list of " Bibliographies of 
Bibliographies," edited by Mr. Aksel G. S. Josephson. 
The number of titles included is 156, and the list fills 
a neatly printed pamphlet of about forty pages. The 
title of this work is to be taken literally, for each entry 
deals, not with the bibliography of a subject, but with 
the bibliographies of that subject. It requires some 
effort to grasp this idea, but less than the effort that 
will be required, at some future time, to grasp the idea 
of a " Bibliography of Bibliographies of Bibliographies " 
with the work now before us as the pioneer production 
of its class. The earliest date of the present entries is 
1654, but only eight of the whole number antedate the 
nineteenth century.

THE BEGINNINGS OP A FAMOUS CAREER.* 

Professor Max Muller's autobiography is a 
fragment that takes us little beyond the thresh- 
old of his career, namely, into the early days 
at Oxford, and not out of the period during 
which Sanskrit was his sole pursuit. But it is 
an important fragment biographically, since it 
deals with a portion of the writer's life rela- 
tively little known, and shows how and why 
the current of his career and work first took 
the direction it did. 

Friedrich Max Miiller was born on Dec. 6, 
1823, in the ducal town of Dessau in Central 
Germany. His father, Wilhelm Miiller, libra- 
rian at Dessau, was one of the most popular 
poets of Germany hardly one of the greatest, 
perhaps, though Heine ranked his lyrics second 
only to Goethe's, and we find that in the critical 
anthology of Echtermeyer sixteen pieces of his 
are given, which is a large quota relatively. 
At the age of thirty-three Wilhelm Miiller 
died, leaving but scanty provision for his widow, 
" fabulously " so, his son says, when one con- 
siders that she had to bring up two children 
on it. But even aside from the stress of the res 
angusta domi, life seems to have been rather 
a sad affair for the fatherless little ones at the 
Miiller home. For years it was a house of 
mourning, the widow nursing her grief with a 
pious if inconsiderate constancy that cast a pall 
over the lives of her children. Miiller says : 
" All I remember of my mother at that time was 
that she took her two children day after day to the 
beautiful Gottesacker (God's Acre), where she stood 
for hours at our father's grave, and sobbed and cried. 
It was a beautiful and restful place, covered with old 
acacia trees. The inscription over the gateway was one 
of my earliest puzzles: Tod ist nicht Tod, ist nur Ver- 
edlung menschlicher Natur (Death is not death, 'tis but 
the ennobling of man's nature). . . . When my mother 
said she wished to die, and to be with our father, I feel 
sure that my sister and I were only anxious that she 
should take us with her, for there were few golden 
chains that bound us as yet to this life." 

Passing by the author's pleasant chapter on 
Dessau life and manners, over which the re- 
viewer is tempted to linger, we find that at 
twelve he was sent to the famous Nicolai-Schule 
at Leipzig. The school was then under Dr. 
Nobbe (known in England through his edition 
of Cicero), and it had an excellent staff of 
masters, among them Palm, Forbiger, and

Funkhanel, sound classical scholars all, and 
men of more than national reputation. Clas- 
sical studies were naturally given the prece- 
dence at the Nicolai-Schule, all else, modern 
languages, mathematics, physics, etc., having 
comparatively a poor chance of it. While the 
author, as he says, " liked his classics," and 
went as in duty bound into the stock raptures 
" about Homer and Sophocles, about Horace 
and Cicero," he was nevertheless haunted by 
the suspicion that there was a tinge of cant in 
the praises lavished by the masters on the old 
authors at the expense of the new. 

" The exaggeration in the panegyrics passed on 
everything Greek or Latin dates from the classical 
scholars of the Middle Ages, who knew nothing that 
could be compared to the classics, and who were loutl 
in praising what they possessed the monopoly of selling. 
Successive generations of scholars followed suit, so that 
even in our time it seemed high treason to compare 
Goethe with Horace, or Schiller with Sophocles." 

In 1841 the author left the Nicolai-Schule, 
and soon after passed his examination for ad- 
mission to Leipzig University. He had deter- 
mined to study philology, chiefly Greek and 
Latin ; but, delighted as he was with such 
guides and teachers as Professors Hermann and 
Haupt, he found little in the chiefly critical 
work assigned him to rouse his enthusiasm. 
Everything, he felt, had already been done, 
and there was no virgin soil left on which to 
try one's own spade. So, dissatisfied with what 
seemed a mere chewing of the cud in Greek 
and Latin, he betook himself to systematic 
. philosophy, joining the philosophical societies 
of Weisse, Drobisch, and Lotze. For a time 
he dreamed of becoming a philosopher, and it 
was while indulging in this dream that he began 
to feel that he must know something special, 
something that no other philosopher knew ; 
and thus his thoughts gradually turned to 
Sanskrit as to a key to the possible infinite 
riches of systems yet little known to the think- 
ers of the West. He had read the explanatory 
and somewhat fanciful books on the speech 
and philosophy of India by Schlegel and Win- 
dischmann, and these, he says, " had left on 
me, as they did on many, that feeling which 
the digger who prospects for minerals is said 
to have, that there must be gold beneath the 
surface, if people would only dig." The needed 
impulse to the latent inclination came with the 
founding at Leipzig of the new professorship 
of Sanskrit, which was given to Professor 
Brockhaus. Max Miiller then determined to 
see what there was to be learnt in Sanskrit, 
and to, gratify, he admits, his desire to study 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



261 



something which his friends and fellow-students 
did not know. Calling upon Brockhaus he 
found that there were then but two students 
besides himself who cared to attend the new 
lectures, for the prejudice against Sanskrit was 
still strong among classical scholars, although 
among those who stood up for it were men like 
von Humboldt and the two von Schlegels. The 
author confesses that the champions of the new 
learning gave vent in their first enthusiasm to 
many exaggerated opinions. 

" Sanskrit was represented as the mother of all lan- 
guages, instead of being the elder sister of the Aryan 
family. The beginning of all language, of all thought, 
of all religion, was traced back to India, and when 
Greek scholars were told that Zeus existed in the Veda 
under the name of Dyaus there was a great flutter in the 
dovecotes of classical scholarship. Many of these en- 
thusiastic utterances had afterwards to be toned down." 

The author's zeal for his new studies met 
with small encouragement at Leipzig, and he 
had to be chary of his supposed Sanskritist 
heresies in the seminary of Gottfried Her- 
mann, or in the Latin society of Haupt in 
the latter particularly, for Hermann saw there 
was a new light and refused to obstruct it. In 
him learning begot a liberality that is not 
always its offspring. Hermann saw that the 
verbal coincidences between Greek and Sans- 
krit could not be casual, and made generous 
concessions to the new learning. He did not 
discourage Miiller (as his colleagues probably 
did) when he determined in his third year at 
Leipzig to go to Berlin to hear Bopp. 

After some nine months at Berlin the author 
went to Paris, and his stay there, from March, 
1845, to June, 1846, proved a useful inter- 
mezzo as well as a main factor in determining 
his future career. His object in going to Paris 
was of course largely to hear Burnouf, then 
lecturing to a select class at the College de 
France on Indian philosophy and religion. 
Bnrnouf, a charming man and a fine specimen 
of the real French savant, encouraged the 
young German scholar in every way, lent him 
his own Vedic MSS. to copy (when the great 
edition of the Rig-veda was, at Burnouf's in- 
stance, really begun), guided him to the MSS. 
at the Bibliotbeque Royale, and, what was then 
of no small moment, cheered his droopiug 
spirits at times when the patent difficulty of 
finding a publisher for his huge and commer- 
cially unpromising forthcoming work loomed 
large and disheartening. "The commentary 
must be published, depend upon it, and it will 
be," said the cheery Frenchman, and so the 
drudgery of copying and collating went on. 



Ordinary copying is dreary work, but copying 
Sanskrit for hours at a stretch from manu- 
script, was deadly. Mistakes were inevitable 
under the usual process of transcribing, so a 
new one had to be invented. 

" This new process," says the author, " I discovered 
by using transparent paper, and thus tracing every let- 
ter. I had some excellent papier vegetal made for me, 
and, instead of copying, traced the whole Sanskrit MS." 

As the work progressed the question of a 
publisher tended to become the engrossing one. 
An effort by Humboldt to secure the aid of 
the King of Prussia in the enterprise came to 
nought, as did a rather vague and imprac- 
ticable offer from St. Petersburg, which Bur- 
nouf advised the author not to accept. The 
solution of the problem was brought about in 
a rather fortuitous way during a visit of Miiller 
to England. He had long felt the necessity 
of making a trip to London in order to copy 
and collate some MSS. which were in the Li- 
brary of the East India Company, but had 
lacked funds for the journey. In June, 1846, 
he was enabled to start, and on arriving at 
London he at once began work in the Com- 
pany's library in Leadenhall Street. He had 
been employed there for nearly a month when 
it occurred to him that he ought to call upon 
the Prussian Minister, Baron Bunsen. The 
visit proved the turning-point of his life. He 
found in the Baron a friend, a social sponsor, 
and, what was practically most important, a 
fellow-Sanskritist who as a young man had 
proposed to himself as the work of his life the 
very task upon which he, Miiller, was engaged, 
namely, the editio princeps of the Rig-veda. 
Drifting into diplomacy, the Baron had given 
up his early design ; but he at once warmly 
entered into Miiller's project, and his interest 
happily took a practical turn. He saw that 
the East India Company was the proper body 
to publish the work. It was of course no easy 
task to get the Board of Directors all keen 
and practical men of business to authorize 
the printing, at great expense, in six volumes 
quarto of a thousand pages each, of an old 
book that none of them could understand, and 
many of them had never even heard of. But 
Bunsen's name was a power in England, and 
his efforts were ably seconded by Professor 
Wilson, the Librarian of the Company ; so 
that it was at last settled that the East India 
Company was to bear the cost of the printing 
of the Veda, and to defray the editor's expenses 
while the work was preparing for the press. 
The financial difficulty thus settled, the rest 



262 



THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



was comparatively plain sailing for Miiller. 

It was decided that the !Rig-veda should be 
printed at Oxford, and thither the editor con- 
cluded to migrate. His first visit there had 
filled him with enthusiasm for the beautiful 
old town, where, as he says, " even the under- 
graduates, dressed in their mediaeval academic 
costume, looked to me very grand, and so dif- 
ferent from the German students at Leipzig 
or still more at Jena, walking about the streets 
in pink cotton trousers and dressing-gowns." 
It is pleasant to note that Miiller was deeply 
impressed with the " real friendliness " shown 
him, an unknown German scholar, at Oxford ; 
but the idea of settling permanently at that 
" academic paradise " did not for some time 
occur to him. 

" I was there to print my Rig-veda and work at the 
Bodleian; that I should in a few years be an M.A. of 
Christ Church, a Fellow of the most exclusive of col- 
leges, nay, a married Fellow a being not even in- 
vented then and a professor of the University, never 
entered into my wildest dreams." 

Reminiscences, in the vein of the author's 
pleasant volumes on " Auld Lang Syne," of 
Oxford and Oxonians in early days, form the 
staple of the two closing chapters of the Auto- 
biography. Among the early friends at Ox- 
ford of whom mention is made is Matthew 
Arnold. Says the author : 

" It strikes one that while he was at Oxford, few 
people only detected in Arnold the poet or the man 
of remarkable genius. . . . Then suddenly came the 
time when he returned to Oxford as the poet, as the 
professor of poetry, nay, afterwards as the philosopher 
also, placed high by public opinion among the living 
worthies of England. What was sometimes against 
him was his want of seriousness. A laugh from his 
hearers or readers seemed to be more valued by him 
than their serious opposition, or their convinced assent. 
He trusted, like others, to persiflage, and the result was 
that when he tried to be serious, people could not for- 
get that he might at any time turn round and smile, 
and decline to be taken au grand serieux." 

The view of Matthew Arnold as an incurable 
persifleur seems to us a rather novel and not 
wholly sound one. To banter, indeed, he was 
sometimes given ; and everyone knows how 
effectively he used to rally that peculiarly im- 
pervious and self-satisfied class of his country- 
men devoted, he thought, mainly to chapels, 
business, tea-meetings, comfort, and the phil- 
osophy of Sir Daniel Gooch. But if it be true, 
as we suppose it is in a measure, that -people 
declined to take Matthew Arnold quite seri- 
ously, was it not rather because the social 
remedies he preached seemed to them ludi- 
crously disproportionate to the ills he proposed 
to cure ? " One does not," says Danton, 



" make revolutions with rose-water "; and so 
Mr. Arnold's faith in the saving efficacy of 
culture may well have seemed to sterner spirits, 
as he admitted, " a religion proposing parma- 
ceti, or some scented salve or other, as a cure 
for human miseries." 

The editor of the Autobiography, Mr. W. G. 
Max Miiller, has acquitted himself well in the 
plainly difficult task of putting in shape the 
fragments and jottings at his disposal. Much 
of the matter was written or dictated during 
the last weeks of the author's life, his desire 
being to leave as much as possible ready for 
publication. That the end came so soon no 
reader of this cheery record of the morning of 
a changeful and bustling, if studious, life will 
fail to regret. E. G. J. 



THE STORM AND STRESS IN THE BLACK 
WORLD.* 

From the dark world beyond the Color-line 
come usually only faint murmurs to the world 
without so faint that some deny altogether 
to this world, word and thought. But now 
and then there comes a wild discordant note, 
which sets men wondering not so much at the 
words said as at the pitch and passion of the cry. 

So it is with Mr. Hannibal Thomas's " The 
American Negro." The voice of a Negro 
talking of Negroes has not yet ceased sounding 
unusual to our ears. The actual content of his 
message is of no great intrinsic importance ; 
there is some history of the encyclopaedic order, 
many general observations showing thought 
and reading, and passing evidence of eccentric 
originality and no little ability. But all this is of 
transient interest compared with the tone of the 
book : its cynical pessimism, virulent criticisms, 
vulgar plainness, and repeated and glaring self- 
contradictions. The reader instinctively feels 
that the book means more than it says. 

And so it does. Mr. Thomas's book is a 
sinister symptom a growth and development 
under American conditions of life which illus- 
trates peculiarly the anomalous position of 
black men, and the terrific stress under which 
they struggle. And the struggle and fight of 
human beings against hard conditions of life 
always tends to develope the criminal or the 
hypocrite, the cynic or the radical. Where- 
ever among a hard-pressed people these types 
begin to appear, it is the visible sign of a bur-

den that is threatening to overtax their strength, 
and the foreshadowing of the age of revolt. 

The American Negro is still as a race too 
hopeful of his future, and able to point out too 
many undeniable evidences of progress, to 
harbor as yet any well defined thoughts of 
spiritual or physical revolt. And yet among 
the incompetent, the impatient, and the dis- 
appointed among those black men who al- 
ready in the severe struggle for existence have 
fallen by the wayside, the sinister types that 
war with society are beginning to appear : the 
ignorant contemner of law and order, and the 
sly deceiver ; and the better trained man who 
has lost faith either in the coming of the Good 
or in the Good itself. 

Mr. Thomas is peculiarly the type of the 
Negro cynic. He may speak of virtue, and 
interlard a few general phrases of goodness 
and hope, but they are lost in his general des- 
pair, they have a hollow, unreal sound beside 
the rest of his words. At bottom his book is 
without faith or ideal. He is one of those 
embodied disappointments of Reconstruction 
times ; one who went South to show the World 
and the Negro how to do everything in a day, 
and succeeded only in shattering his ideals, 
and becoming embittered and dissatisfied with 
men. Wandering from place to place and 
from occupation to occupation, he finally set- 
tled in Boston, where in 1890 he published a 
pamphlet* which now, re-written, appears as 
" The American Negro." This pamphlet fell 
unnoticed from the press, and the inner striv- 
ings of the Negro people soon lost him what 
influence he had possessed among them. 

The new spiritual longings of the Negro, 
and the outreaching for real progress, has de- 
veloped in the last decade a higher type of 
race leadership than formerly, and ousted 
many of the demagogues and rascals. A new 
race literature of promise has appeared, and a 
race consciousness such as the modern world 
has never before seen among black folk. These 
results have been bitterly resented by many 
men, and it seems to be this resentment that 
has caused Mr. Thomas's pamphlet of 1890 to 
be re- written for the book of 1901. The 
pamphlet was a defense of the Negro, with 
severe criticisms on the whites, and laid down 
the thesis that land owning and education 
both industrial and higher would solve the 
Negro problems. In the re-writing the criti-

sion of the Mental and Physical Needs of the Freedmen."

cisms on the whites were toned down, and then 
with a sort of cool ferocity, without pity or re- 
straint, there was added a denunciation of the 
Negro in America unparalleled in vindictive- 
ness and exaggeration. The result is natur 
ally a contradictory book, for alongside the 
new anathemas lie the old schemes for ameli- 
oration and grounds for hope. Many passages 
illustrate this, but perhaps two will suffice : 



THOMAS nr 1890 : 
" I venture the opinion that 
of those who descant so glibly 
on Negro inferiority, not one 
has an accurate knowledge of 
facts on the social side of his 
life. ... I take it upon my- 
self, therefore, to say that a 
considerate investigation 
through personal contact will 
disclose as much of the sa- 
credness of living, as scrupu- 
lous regard for truth and 
virginal honor, as keen an 
appreciation, and as much of 
the practice of Christian in- 
tegrity, with as intimate a 
familiarity with the best lit- 
erature and the highest forms 
of civilization, whenever op- 
portunity permits, as charac- 
terizes the more pretentious 
white race " (pp. 7, 8). 



"Therefore it may be 
frankly and fearlessly said 
that the Negro when honestly 
measured through the amen- 
ities of social contact, either 
in the industrial department 
or intellectual field, dispels 
much of the false knowledge 
with which an unreasoning 
prejudice has invested him. 
. . . Studied in the light of 
his past, I think it will be 
found that he has no greater 
virtues nor grosser vices than 
are common to other races of 
mankind, and like them in 
manhood true and good, in- 
telligent and upright " 
(pp. 8, 9). 



THOMAS IN 1901 : 
"In fact I doubt if any 
white person lives who has 
an adequate comprehension 
of Negro characteristics, not- 
withstanding the many who 
descant so glibly on the pres- 
ent and future of the freed 
people" <p. xix. i. 

" Soberly speaking, Negro 
nature is so craven and sen- 
suous in every fibre of its 
being that a Negro manhood 
with decent respect for chaste 
womanhood does not exist" 
(p. 180). 

" Fully 90 per cent, of the 
Negro women of America 
[are] lascivious by instinct, 
and in bondage to physical 
pleasure. . . . The social 
degradation of our freed 
women is without a parallel in 
modern civilization " (p. 195). 



"... We may take the 
word virtue, whose exact sig- 
nificance no Negro compre- 
hends who fails therefore 
to engraft its import into the 
fibre of his being. . . . The 
same is true of the words 
like truth, honor, and integ- 
rity. These are meaningless 
expressions, and because the 
Negro cannot connect words 
with ideas and ideas with 
realities, he lies with avidions 
readiness without undergoing 
the slightest remorse, and 
often without any apparent 
sense of prevarication " 
(p. 118). 



It is, of course, conceivable that a man 
should utterly change his opinions in ten years ; 
but when opinions formed after twenty-five 
years of close contact with actual conditions 
are radically altered after ten years' absence 
from those conditions, the later testimony is 
certainly less valuable than the earlier. And 
when, too, this conversion is marred by so evi- 
dent bitterness and recklessness, and when 
one remembers that the writer himself is a 
Negro, born of a Negro mother, then his book 
can only be explained as a rare exhibition of 
that contempt for themselves which some Ne- 
groes still hold as a heritage of the past. 

Before such an attack as this, nine millions

of human beings stand helpless. The swift 
defense which social groups have ever exer- 
cised against the malignor is not theirs to 
wield. They cannot edit the things said about 
them as can other races and people. But it is 
possible for the most discredited of their race 
to gain now and then by singular accident and 
the exigencies of the book market, respectful 
hearing and wide advertisement. One dis- 
couraging cause of this, is the more or less un- 
conscious Wish for the Worst in regard to the 
Negro, to satisfy the logic of his anomalous 
situation. If the Negro will kindly go to the 
devil and make haste about it, then the Amer- 
ican conscience can justify three centuries of 
shameful history ; and hence the subdued en- 
thusiasm which greets a sensational article or 
book that proves all Negroes worthless. 

All men know that the American Negro is 
ignorant and poor, with criminal and immoral 
tendencies. And some of us know why. Never- 
theless the Negroes are not as ignorant as the 
Russians, nor as poor as the Irish, nor as crim- 
inal as the English and French workingmen, 
nor sexually as incontinent as the Italians. If 
there is hope for Europe there is abundant 
hope for the Negro. And if there is hope, 
then in the name of decency let the American 
people refuse to use their best agencies for 
publicity in distributing exaggerations and 
misrepresentations such as " The American 
Negro." yr E BURGHARDT DuBois.

FACT AND FABL.E IN PSYCHOLOGY.* 



The optimistic scientist is wont to regard 
Occultism as a kind of feeble intellectual para- 
site, unfit to cope with the strenuous conditions 
of modern life and consequently doomed to 
speedy extinction. To the dispassionate ob- 
server, however, certain contemporary tenden- 
cies suggest in the surviving species of the 
occult a tenacity of life, which threatens a 
serious postponement of the scientific millen- 
ium. One certainly cannot view such psychic 
epidemics, as the spread of Spiritualism during 
the years 1848-50, and the wave of Christian 
Science and Faith Healing in the present de- 
cade, without discerning that for large portions 
of even the educated public, to say nothing of 
the intellectually submerged tenth, both the 
spirit and the letter of exact science are closed

books. It is, therefore, a matter of no small 
importance to clear up the precise nature of 
the quarrel which science has with these move- 
ments, and to locate, if possible, the boundary 
line between knowledge and superstition, be- 
tween science and mysticism. Professor Jas- 
trow's " Fact and Fable in Psychology," which 
furnishes our text, is an admirable brief for 
the scientific side of this case. 

The general charge which science brings 
against Occultism, is that of ignorant contempt 
for the majesty of natural law. The cruder 
forms of Occultism, exemplified by some of the 
ebullitions of theosophists, are chiefly notable 
as evidences of colossal insensibility to fact. 
They have no more bearing on the real devel- 
opment of intelligence than have the delusional 
theories of the insane. The real controversy 
is with a much more masterful adversary. 

There is a considerable group of highly cul- 
tivated men, among them some conspicuous 
scientists, for whom scientific orthodoxy is 
tested not more by assent to the finality of 
such laws as science has already formulated, 
than by the maintenance of a catholic and 
open-minded attitude toward fresh knowledge, 
however revolutionary, in whose light the older 
principles may be newly interpreted. These 
men are the bitter enemies of intolerant dog- 
matism, whether it pose as science or as relig- 
ion, and they insist that science is nowadays 
guilty of intolerable bigotry in its refusal to 
countenance well-attested facts, simply because 
they are seemingly irreconcilable with accepted 
physical principles. 

Clearly the outcome of this protestant reac- 
tionary attitude of mind will depend altogether 
on the sobriety with which it is employed. 
Such a position may lead simply to an enlarge- 
ment of knowledge concerning the interrela- 
tions of different forces in the universe. But 
it is only a step to a totally different conse- 
quence, in the shape of a practical abandonment 
of belief in the inviolability of demonstrated 
uniformities in nature. Undoubtedly the rain 
descends upon the just and the unjust without 
regard to ethical decency, and no one's faith 
is thereby disturbed. But if spirits can lift 
tables and hold them suspended in the air, in 
spite of the operation of gravity, then knowl- 
edge is at an end; the whole fabric of science 
deliquesces into a mere logomachy, human con- 
duct degenerates into a gambling upon chance, 
and man himself becomes the plaything of 
every eddy that may happen to roil the waters 
of his ignorance. 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



265 



No amount of juggling with the ancient 
theological device for explaining the miracu- 
lous will, the scientist insists, do away with 
this dilemma. If, in such a case as that of our 
illustration, one speaks of the operation of a 
higher law, which somehow transcends tempo- 
rarily the law of gravity, one of two things is 
meant : either some force other than gravity, 
say magnetism, has momentarily obscured the 
apparent operation of gravity and this is 
wholly conformable to the strictest conception 
of immutability in natural law, or gravity is 
not an invariable principle displayed in the 
relations of masses to one another. The latter 
alternative, if true, annihilates science. 

Naturally the advocates of liberalism in this 
controversy would resent the name Occultism 
as applied to them. They are nothing, if not 
defenders of the idea of law. They contend, 
however, for the whole law, and protest against 
identifying with this whole the trivial segment 
which physical science, with its mechanical 
conceptions, has thus far succeeded in decipher- 
ing. But in actual practice much of their pro- 
cedure becomes indistinguishable from that of 
the genuine occultist, because they are ready 
to recognize causes unknown to science (e. g.^ 
telepathy) in explanation of phenomena which 
scientists regard as partially spurious, and in 
the remaining instances as entirely explicable 
upon the basis of accepted principles. In 
almost every instance the real controversy will 
be found to reduce itself to the question of 
whether the operations of physical forces are 
ever modified or suspended by non-physical 
agencies. This issue is raised in connection 
with spiritualism, mesmerism, Christian Sci- 
ence, necromancy, telepathy, clairvoyance, etc. 
Did the liberalists mean by their agencies (as, 
for instance, telepathy) simply some hitherto 
unidentified physical process, such as the 
Roentgen ray, the present dispute would never 
have arisen. Unfortunately, so far as concerns 
the preservation of the peace, this is not the 
case with most of them. To compromise with 
this mood is, the scientist maintains, to barter 
the birthright of one's rationality for the pot- 
tage of lunacy. 

Probably no one in America has done more 
than Professor Jastrow to disarm the common 
forms of Occultism of their more pernicious 
consequences. He has made himself widely 
known as a lucid and vigorous essayist, whose 
forceful expositions of the conservative scien- 
tific attitude on such subjects as we have been 
discussing have won him a well-merited repute. 



In his present volume he has gathered together 
eleven of his previously published papers, sub- 
mitting them to a careful revision, which in 
one or two instances amounts to a re-writing. 
The articulation of the several members of the 
series is much more successful than commonly 
occurs in books made up in this fashion. 

An admirable essay on the Modern Occult, 
canvassing theosophy, Christian Science, etc., 
stands first in the series and sounds the key- 
note of the whole book. This is followed by 
a somewhat drastic criticism of the Society for 
Psychical Research, and a depreciatory esti- 
mate of the results and future possibilities of 
such work. Mr. Jastrow gives the devil his 
due in acknowledging the accumulation by this 
organization of much valuable psychological 
material, but the balance sheet still shows, in 
his opinion, a heavy deficit by reason of the 
damage done by the Society to the psycholo- 
gist's scientific reputation. An examination of 
mental telegraphy, issuing in a conclusion of 
its probably fictitious character, is fittingly 
followed by a description of the psychology of 
deception, as illustrated by the conjurer and 
the ordinary medium. An essay upon invol- 
untary muscular movements, including a dis- 
cussion of muscle-reading, is closely connected 
in subject matter with the last mentioned 
papers, although given a later position in the 
volume. Spiritualism and hypnotism each 
receive scholarly treatment, partly historical 
and partly analytical. An entertaining paper 
on mental prepossession is in many ways inti- 
mately connected with the second of these 
topics. The dreams of the blind are ably dis- 
cussed, although the subject seems a trifle 
aside from the main stream of the essays. 
Probably the least important of the chapters 
is upon the mind's eye, under which title the 
familiarities of the psychological texts upon 
perception and illusion are briefly set forth. 
An extremely able paper upon argument from 
analogy furnishes in a sense the logical ful- 
crum of the whole volume and completes the 
list of essays. 

Taken in its entirety, Mr. Jastrow's argu- 
ment consists in showing how strange and 
baffling phenomena, for whose explanation 
supernatural causes have been invoked, have 
one after another been reduced to cases of in- 
telligible and often familiar occurrences dis- 
torted by mal-observation and defective reason- 
ing. It is of course impossible in any brief 
resume to convey a just impression of the 
cumulative force of an argument of this type, 



266 



THE DIAL

when applied successively to the several groups 
of phenomena which have afforded occasion 
for the majority of supernaturalistic hypotheses. 
Suffice it to say, the achievement is thoroughly 
skilful, and Mr. Jastrow's book may be safely 
prescribed in large doses for all cases of in- 
cipient occultism. The moral, as well as the 
intellectual, advantages of scientific conserva- 
tism are made abundantly evident. But to the 
end, temperamental rather than purely logical 
considerations will doubtless determine the 
attitude toward these problems of many pre- 
sumably intelligent persons. There are, more- 
over, profounder forms of mysticism than any 
of these with which Mr. Jastrow has chosen to 
deal. They contain, however, no serious menace 
to science, and their omission is accordingly 
justifiable. JAMES ROWLAND ANGELL. 



CHAPTERS FROM ILLINOIS HISTORY.* 

In no line of historical writing has there 
been such marked advancement in recent years 
as in " state " histories. Formerly the term 
meant a series of reminiscences of early comers 
in which tradition, anecdote, and a thousand 
trifling details occupied the place of leading 
facts, logical development, and scholarly deduc- 
tions. Or it meant a " guide for emigrants," 
giving a kind of encyclopaedic summary, 
which grew into a subscription book, with a 
number of plates of important personages at 
so much per plate. 

Only too rarely has the scholarly business 
man had the zeal to turn aside and enter a 
field which has no special attraction for the 
professional historical writer. Such a man 
was the late Edward G. Mason, for some time 
President of the Chicago Historical Society, 
and to whom that institution owes much of its 
present flourishing condition. Although only 
an adopted citizen of Illinois, having been born 
in Connecticut and educated at Yale, he entered 
upon a special study of the early days in the 
Illinois country with a zest and a training 
which made him an authority upon that topic. 
His enthusiasm has placed in the Chicago His- 
torical Society many priceless records which 
would otherwise have gone the primrose way 
of their fellows to destruction. 

It was the purpose of Mr. Mason to write a 
scholarly history of Illinois one which should 
go to original sources for material, should be 

* CHAPTERS FROM ILLINOIS HISTORY. By Edward Q. 
Mason. With portrait. Chicago : Herbert S. Stone & Co. 



readable, and which should eliminate entirely 
the commercial phases of the subscription his- 
tory. This high purpose was cut short by his 
untimely death, and finds but a sad kind of 
fulfillment in the present posthumous work en- 
titled " Chapters from Illinois History." 

One of the shorter chapters, " Illinois in the 
Eighteenth Century," consists of a description 
of the beginnings of American rule in Illinois 
under Colonel John Todd, who became Vir- 
ginia governor after the conquest by George 
Rogers Clark. A second sketch is an excellent 
description of a personal visit to old Fort 
Chartres near the Mississippi below St. Louis, 
in which the ruins are rebuilt in the author's 
fancy and re-peopled by Makarty, Renault, and 
the early French. The chapter on " The 
March of the Spanish Across Illinois " is a 
plausible argument that this expedition from 
Spanish St. Louis in 1781, against the English 
at St. Joseph, was intended to aid in the Span- 
ish claim to the country east of the Mississippi 
when negotiations to close the Revolutionary 
War should be entered upon. Two lesser 
chapters, " Illinois in the Revolution " and 
"The Chicago Massacre" (of 1812), are suf- 
ficiently described in their titles. 

Two of the five chapters named above were 
previously printed, and the whole would no- 
doubt have been incorporated in the finished 
work. They are fragmentary. But the first 
"chapter" of the book, "The Land of the 
Illinois," is of sufficient length to manifest the 
literary style, the thoroughness of detail, and 
the balance of topics, which would have char- 
acterized the whole had the original plan been 
carried out. 

Mr. Mason begins with the reference by 
Champlain on his map to " a nation where 
there is a quantity of buffalo," as indicating 
the land of the Illinois Indians. Thence the 
story is carried forward through Marquette, 
who the author thinks receives the credit nat- 
urally belonging to Jolliet ; through the heroic 
achievements of LaSalle and Tonty, to the 
death of the former. The recital closes ab- 
ruptly with the reappointment of Frontenac as 
governor of Canada in 1689. 

The sudden death of the author in his prime 
has a sad parallel in this sudden termination 
of the story in the height of its excellence. 
The enthusiasm of Mr. Mason over the stirring 
deeds of LaSalle and his great lieutenant is 
evident in every line. He leaves Tonty, gov- 
ernor of his lofty Fort St. Louis, looking down 
the valley of the Illinois, awaiting the return

of his captain who lies in the far south, stricken 
down by a treacherous hand. 

Of course Mr. Mason had to depend upon 
the " Relations " of the Jesuits for his infor- 
mation, but he has supplemented them when- 
ever possible. His array of references is at 
first startling, and then begets confidence. 
Where authorities differ, he has weighed the 
arguments with the training of the lawyer. The 
style is plain but the composition faultless. 
The purpose evidently is to convey the meaning 
to the reader with a view to the " economy of 
attention." Of the many writings upon Illinois 
history, it is probably safe to say that none is 
so scholarly, so careful, and so trustworthy as 
these " chapters " from the pen of Mr. Mason.

BUDDHISM, TRUE AND FALSE.* 

Suppose that in this day and age of the 
world a " life of Jesus " should be written, pur- 
porting to be a veritable history, and based on 
the so-called Apocryphal Gospels and similar 
authorities. Suppose, further, that the latter 
part of this *' life " should be taken up with an 
argument, buttressed by citations, to prove 
that Mohammedanism was really a complete 
plagiarism of Christianity. Of equal scientific 
value and of a similar type of content is Mr. 
Arthur Lillie's "Buddha and Buddhism," a 
new volume in the series of " The World's 
Epoch Makers." What is presented as a 
" life " of Buddha is taken largely, without hint 
of the character of the sources, from the highly 
poetical, fanciful, and legendary stories about 
Buddha contained in the late northern litera- 
ture. The story is told for the most part in a 
series of independent paragraphs whose primary 
aim is to show how similar to incidents in the 
life of Jesus are certain events in Buddha's 
career. Ever and anon such statements appear 
as this : " There is scarcely a doubt now with 
scholars that the early Christians borrowed the 
solution of earth's mighty problem from India " 
(p. 20). One entire chapter is given to the 
argument that the Essenes were Buddhists and

that Jesus was an Essene. The mode of argu- 
ment is illustrated by the following remarks : 
" Historical questions are sometimes made 
more clear by being treated broadly. Let us 
first deal with this from the impersonal side, 
leaving out altogether the alleged words and 
deeds of Christ, Paul, etc." (p. 159). In other 
words, Mr. Lillie instead of giving a clear and 
scientific narrative of what is really known 
about Buddha, and stating frankly the charac- 
ter and value of his authorities early and late 
a piece of work much to be desired, has 
produced a polemic maintaining that Chris- 
tianity, posing as the religion of Jesus, is really 
a wholesale plagiarism from Buddhism. The 
book is no more than a rehash of the author's 
previous writings on the same subject, and is 
of like importance. 

A strange coincidence has brought together 
in the same year this amorphous book of Mr. 
Lillie, and a treatise on the same subject by 
Dr. C. F. Aiken, in which the desirable and 
serviceable about Buddha and his system have 
been said with clearness, accuracy, and sobri- 
ety. The title is badly chosen, and will frighten 
off the very persons who would profit most by 
reading the book. The treatment is in three 
parts, first, a discussion of the relation of 
Buddhism to the antecedent Brahmanism ; 
second, the presentation of the system itself in 
its historical development, containing a chapter 
on Buddha's life from the earliest and most 
trustworthy sources ; third, an examination of 
the alleged relations of Buddhism with Chris- 
tianity. In view of the unfounded assertions 
on this last topic in Mr. Lillie's work, the third 
part makes very interesting and profitable read- 
ing. The author takes up with painstaking 
thoroughness and unwearied pursuit of details 
the various and devious allegations of the 
school to which Mr. Lillie belongs, with the 
result anticipated, indeed, but none the less 
satisfactory that these writers are convicted 
of misrepresentations, garbled quotations, an- 
achronisms, and " fictions " (to use Mr. Aiken's 
mild term). It is almost incredible that writers 
claiming to be scientific scholars could be guilty 
of such charges, but ample proof is given in 
the course of this critical and unsparing exam- 
ination. The argument amounts to a demon- 
stration. Dr. Aiken has rendered a service to 
Christianity, but, beyond that, he has made a 
notable contribution to the cause of sound 
learning and scientific truth. He has added, 
besides, a valuable bibliography of Buddhist 
texts and modern treatises.

THE DIAL 



[April 16, 



The " Discourse on the Awakening of Faith 
in the Mahayana " is a pretty stiff bit of meta- 
physics which reflects credit alike on the author 
and the translator. It illustrates the keenness 
of thinking characteristic of the best Buddhist 
treatises. The style is repetitious and dreary. 
The faith which is inculcated rests upon 
knowledge of a very complicated and subtle 
system of philosophy. The translator has put 
every student of Buddhism into his debt by 
making this work available and annotating it 
with such care and intelligence. Mahayana 
texts have not received anything like the atten- 
tion they deserve, and it is to be hoped that 
Mr. Teitaro Suzuki will continue his labors in 
this field. GEORGE S. GOODSPEED. 



RECEXT FICTION.* 



An interesting experiment is being tried by one 
of the most important of our publishing houses. It 
takes the form of a series of twelve novels, to be 
published at monthly intervals, each of the twelve 
dealing with some local condition or phase of con- 
temporary life. These novels are to be the work 
of new or comparatively unknown writers, and as 
we do not understand that the entire series has yet 
been provided for, the announcement should serve 
as a stimulus to ambitious young writers all over 
the country. Two volumes in this series have 
already appeared, and we have read them both 
with exceptional interest. The first of the two, 
" Eastover Court House " by name, is the joint 
work of Mr. Henry Bnrnham Boone and Mr. Ken- 
neth Brown. The scene is in rural Virginia, and 
the action takes place during very recent years. 
We should be unable to assign a definite date to 
the story were it not for the appearance of the 
Philippine war in the closing chapters, for the gen- 
eral conditions depicted are such as have been char- 
acteristic of Virginia at almost any time since the 
close of the Civil War. The work is decidedly 
amateurish, and to point out numerous defects 
would be a very easy task. The hero, in particular, 
is extremely disappointing, being both weak and

mean. We learn at the very start that he is saving 
up his money with great care, and we at once scent 
a mystery some heroic resolve or secret obliga- 
tion. When we learn in the end that he has been 
actuated by no higher motive than ordinary parsi- 
mony, it is difficult to repress a feeling of disgust 
that any sympathy should have been wasted upon 
him. We must also say that there is a great deal 
too much horse talk in the book. Horses are inter- 
esting to Virginians, no doubt, but not quite to the 
point thus indicated. The story is valuable as a 
study of manners rather than for any analysis of 
character, or any development of plot, to be found 
within its pages. 

The second volume in this series is " The Senti- 
mentalists," by Mr. Arthur Stanwood Pier. We 
have met Mr. Pier once before in a delightfully 
humorous sketch of the Harvard Summer School 
and we open his new book prepared to be 
pleased. The scene is Boston, varied by excursions 
into Missouri, and the complications of a stock- 
broking promotion make it 'possible to bring two 
localities so diverse, both physically and morally, 
into the scheme of a single novel. The greater 
part of the interest is Bostonian, although by far 
the best chapters in the book are those which de- 
scribe the conflict between the opposing forces of 
corruption in the legislature of the Western State. 
These chapters are depressing reading, but the 
brutal truth that they embody is of a sort only too 
familiar to students of our political life. The writer 
of this story is likely to be persona non grata in 
Missouri, and hardly less so in Boston, which he 
calls u the city of lowest vitality and least signifi- 
cance in the country." Mr. Pier has not proved 
successful in the delineation of any of his charac- 
ters ; the very title of the story warns us that it is 
concerned rather with superficial traits than with 
deep-seated qualities. For at least the first half of 
the book, our constant thought was that we had 
rarely met with so marked a talent for dealing with 
the surface of character combined with so absolute 
an inability to penetrate into its depths. The later 
chapters forced some modification of this judgment, 
which must, however, stand as the essential thing 
to be said about the novel. Weak and unsatisfac- 
tory as he is, there is some slight vitality to the hero, 
but we can find little or no vitality in any other 
of the creatures of bis fancy. The most carefully 
studied figure of all that of the hero's mother 
is a complete failure from the artistic point of view. 
She interests us exceedingly, but we never for a 
moment take her seriously, or find ourselves thinking 
of her as of a really possible human being. 

For a third time Madame " Sarah Grand " comes 
to us with a novel which is essentially a study of 
the enfant terrible. Her first success was gained 
with the story of those " heavenly twins " whose 
pranks and audacities held the reader breathless 
through many hundreds of pages. In her second 
important book Beth remained interesting only as 
long as she remained a child ; when she grew up 



1901.] 



THE DIAL

and developed " views," she became exceedingly 
tiresome. Now we have, in " Babs the Impossible," 
another portrait of precocious childhood, and we 
are beginning to wish that the type presented might 
prove as impossible in fiction as it is in fact. There 
is, however, no denying interest of the kittenish 
Babs, although it is an interest that palls after a 
time. Since Babs remains a child to the end of 
the chapter, she cannot be given " views," like the 
grown-up Beth, but " views " there must be in any 
book by this strenuous champion of her wronged 
sex, and for the purpose of presenting them a 
" new woman " makes an unexpected and quite 
uncalled-for appearance near the close, and has her 
say with much emphasis. She has not the remotest 
connection with the story, but that does not greatly 
matter, for it is almost equally true of the other 
figures that are introduced for our diversion. The 
story is absolutely without structure, coherence, or 
probability ; it amuses by virtue of Babs, her say- 
ings and escapades, and also to a certain extent by 
the schemes of the mountebank Jellybond, whose 
boniment is cleverly done, and who comes next 
after Babs in the order of importance among the 
figures presented. 

Still another study of the enfant terrible is of- 
fered us by Miss Elinor Glyn's "The Visits of 
Elizabeth." Here there is much less of narrative, 
and correspondingly more of art, than " Sarah 
Grand " has to give us. When we look at the 
frontispiece portrait of Elizabeth, we cannot help 
thinking that she will do well indeed if she can live 
up to its charm. On the whole, we should say that 
she does. She is a young English girl of sixteen 
or thereabouts, who has a good many relatives in 
both England and France. She makes a round of 
visits to these relatives, and writes home to her 
mother about them all. Her writing is absolutely 
naive, and therein lies the delightful quality of the 
book. " Gyp " in English this is what the reader 
says to himself when he has read two or three 
chapters, for Elizabeth is very much such a girl as 
Chiffon, for example. She occasionally writes things 
in her innocence that have a very deep meaning, 
as the alert reader will soon realize, and on one 
occasion her audacity, or rather that of the author, 
is so startling that the reader holds his breath. 
The hour that this book requires may not be pro- 
ductive of edification, but no reader will be likely 
to think it misspent. 

Mr. Zangwill' s new novel, comparable in volume 
with " The Master," exhibits both the faults and 
the merits that were found to be characteristic of 
that work. It is perhaps somewhat less turgid and 
loose-jointed, but suffers even more severely from 
the constraint of a forced brilliancy, and a certain 
hardness of temper, verging upon cynicism, that 
puts a damper upon our sympathies when the author 
is most intent upon enlisting them. Mr. Zangwill 
will never produce a really fine novel until he 
conquers the inveterate purpose of being epigram- 
matic upon all occasions, and learns the art of 



making his characters speak, at least occasionally, 
in the language that is used by ordinary mortals. 
This defect alone makes his figures unreal, and 
they are also so distorted in other respects that we 
can hardly be guilty of over-statement in calling 
them caricatures. This is a great pity, for there 
is excellent stuff in this novel, and its fundamental 
theme a protest against the hypocrisy of modern 
politics is one to interest all generous souls. The 
motives which lead our civilized nations to engage 
in schemes of conquest and the subjugation of un- 
offending peoples are dissected with merciless skill, 
and the cant phrases in which these schemes are de- 
fended are satirized with pitiless severity. Although 
the subject of the novel is English, the point of its 
moral is even sharper for Americans, since our 
newly-invented imperialism is purely wanton, where- 
as English imperialism is a historical inheritance 
which it would be difficult not to accept In spite 
of the faults of his work, Mr. Zangwill preaches a 
powerful sermon upon this timely topic. 

If the book just mentioned verges upon cynicism, 
the latest production of the writer known as Ben- 
jamin Swift" steps far over the verge. Cynicism 
unrelieved, and a thoroughly unsympathetic and 
brutal envisagement of human character, is what 
we find in " Nude Souls," as we found these quali- 
ties in "The Tormentor" and "The Destroyer." 
The fascination of morbid psychology for this 
writer seems to be irresistible, and his pathological 
studies are unrelieved by any vestige of a belief 
that these are not, after all, normal types of hu- 
manity. The fascination of his books is unde- 
niable ; they have high distinction of style, and 
they exhibit a masterly delineation of the characters 
with which the imagination of the writer chooses 
to consort. But one would suppose from reading 
him that this is a world in which passion always 
gets the better of reason, and in which the brute 
part of human nature remains unsubdued by all 
the ethical agencies of civilization. This were to 
despair of mankind indeed, and we must indignantly 
refuse to take so base a view of humanity. But 
we must also bear witness to the fascination pos- 
sessed by such a book as " Nude Souls," and it needs 
all our resolution to escape from its baleful spell. 

" The Conscience of Coralie," by Mr. F. Frank- 
fort Moore, is a novel which sins by forced clever- 
ness almost as notably as do the books of Mr. 
Zangwill. The characters, almost without exception, 
are made to converse in a language that bears but 
a remote resemblance to ordinary speech. The 
effect is supposed to be humorous, the humor being 
chiefly characterized by its unexpected inversions 
of ordinary logic. Otherwise, the story is highly 
entertaining. It deals with the experiences in 
England and Ireland of an American heiress from 
Nokomis, Indiana. The author occasionally lets 
his love of burlesque get the better of his judgment, 
as in the scene which represents Coralie as describing 
" Carpenter G. Hanker " and other personalities 
of her native town, but in the main his figure of an

American girl is a serious study. She has a con- 
science which suggests Massachusetts rather than 
Indiana, and she takes England very seriously. 
After making a few startling' discoveries, such as 
learning that Londoners do not habitually gaze 
with reverence upon Westminster Bridge because 
of Wordsworth's sonnet that few of them, indeed, 
have ever heard of the sonnet she sets herself 
the desperate task of trying to reconcile the ideal- 
ism exemplified in English history and literature 
with the seeming indifference and even flippancy 
of its polite society. The chief instrument in her 
education is a socialist agitator, whose brummagem 
ideals she takes to be pure gold until they have 
been tested and exposed. There is also a touch 
of burlesque in the portrayal of this character, and 
we feel that the writer's view is too prejudiced to 
be fair. But when Coralie's eyes are at last opened, 
her judgment goes straight to the mark, and she 
finds that her instincts have been a safer guide than 
her intellect. In other words, she drops the socialist 
and marries the English gentleman whom in her 
heart she has loved all the time. 

Mr. J. Storer Clouston's " The Duke " tells of 
the unexpected accession to rank and fortune of a 
young Colonial. He comes to London to enter into 
his inheritance, and society is agog to make his 
acquaintance. At this point there appears an old 
chum, an Irishman of the reckless and rollicking 
type, and the Duke impulsively decides to play a 
joke upon society. The Irishman is made to per- 
sonate the Duke for a month, while the latter fills 
the post of private secretary to his Grace. The 
complications that result from this exchange of 
posts are set forth in a highly amusing way, and 
the hypocrisies of the fashionable world are satir- 
ized without mercy. When his term is up, the 
bogus Duke shows signs of a determination to hold 
on to his position which might have proved ex- 
tremely awkward for the secretary but the Irish- 
man has got himself into so bad a tangle, both 
socially and financially, that he sees no better way 
out than to "chuck the whole thing," and to dis- 
appear from view. Meanwhile, the real Duke has 
escaped all the designs of mothers with eligible 
daughters, and has found a woman after his own 
heart before his identity has been disclosed.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

A record of the The burden of the lively and in its 
private life of light way informing little book en- 

Vng Edward. ^^ u p rivate Lif e of King Edward 

VII." (Appleton) is that this potentate has been 
during his prolonged youth not only Prince of 
Wales but also prince of good fellows. Whether 
the type of men known as " good fellows " are 
commonly of the timber out of which good kings 
can be made, is a question ; but Englishmen can at 



least congratulate themselves on the fact that their 
new sovereign is a tactful and kindly man who is 
far too sensible and temperamentally easy-going to 
be likely to make trouble by attempting to rule as 
well as reign. His great personal popularity is 
perhaps the most promising sign now discernible 
on the horizon of British politics ; and this valuable 
asset he has thus far shown no disposition to risk 
through a display of tendencies at which liberalism 
might take alarm. The book now before us is from 
the pen of ' a member of the royal household," and 
its contents are of course in the main somewhat 
trivial. The Prince's private habits are gone into 
pretty minutely, and with a pious gusto on the part 
of the narrator that is amusing. Nothing that can 
be told is omitted, from the size of the Prince's hat 
to the quality of his church in anship. Sartorial mat- 
ters are dealt with in detail, and we are informed 
that his Royal Highness is a good shot, a great tri- 
cyclist, a tireless dancer, that he has patronized the 
sport of pigeon-flying, and, in an inspired moment, 
invented a cocktail. Life at Sandringham and at 
Marlborough House is pleasantly described, and 
chapters are devoted to the Prince's " set," his 
race-track exploits, his playgoing, his relations with 
the Church, with art, with letters, with Free- 
masonry, and what not. On the Prince's reputed 
peccadilloes a discreet silence is maintained, as it 
should be. On the whole, one gets the impression 
that the Prince of Wales has in general been a good 
deal of a trifler, and that the British nation may 
well be surprised if Edward VII. shows a disposi- 
tion to take himself or his position very seriously, 
and it is not perhaps altogether desirable that he 
should do so, since the British constitution does 
not. The book contains several photographic plates, 
and its timeliness should ensure its popularity. 

A sound and read- As is P rett y wel1 known among stu- 
abie history of the dents of European history, the " Cam- 
French monarchy. bridge Historical Series" (Macmil- 
lan), edited by Prof. G. W. Prothero, is intended to 
sketch the history of Modern Europe, with that of its 
chief colonies and conquests, from about the end of 
the fifteenth century down to the present time. In 
pursuance of this plan, about a dozen volumes have 
thus far been issued at varying intervals ; and when 
the series is completed it may well be doubted 
whether any equally satisfactory narrative exists 
within the same limits, certainly not in English. 
The large and important field covered by the history 
of the French monarchy has been assigned to Mr. 
A. J. Grant, Professor of History in the Yorkshire 
College (Leeds), of Victoria University. When we 
reflect that his terminal dates were 1483 and 1789, 
we can only mildly wonder at his " original inten- 
tion to compress the history of France between 
these dates within the compass of one volume that 
should not exceed four hundred pages." As a 
matter of fact the two volumes that he has given 
us are an admirable piece of compact philosophical 
narrative, marked by resolute adherence to the im-

THE DIAL 



271 



mediate subject and rigid refusal of even legitimate 
digressions. Professor Grant's theme is the French 
Monarchy : his thesis, following in the steps of 
de Tocqueville and others, is " to show that the Rev- 
olution did not cause so complete a breach with the 
past as many of the actors in it imagined, and that 
the Absolute Monarchy, in spite of its dismal cor- 
ruption under Louis XV. and its catastrophe under 
Louis XVI., rendered nevertheless great services 
to France, anticipating in many points the benefi- 
cent work of the Revolution, and in many others 
preparing the way for it." The old familiar ground 
is carefully traversed ; the authorities seem to have 
been thoroughly compared and digested ; and sev- 
eral events and personalities have been presented 
from a new point of view. For example, Calvin's 
character, and the importance of his doctrine as a 
force in the European religious struggle, are ad- 
mirably summed up : ' In spite of the injustice 
and cruelty of the Calvinistic discipline, Protestant- 
ism, without that discipline and all that flowed from 
it, would neither have won nor deserved the success 
that it achieved." Again, for many readers there 
will be an almost startling readjustment of values 
in accepting Professor Grant's epigram making 
Charles IX. really one of the victims of the St. 
Bartholomew massacre instead of its author. He, 
then, was not the worst of Catherine de' Medici's 
evil brood : that bad eminence is reserved by the 
author for his brother, Henry III. These are but 
glimpses at a book which is both sound history and 
good reading. The work is well bound and beau- 
tifully printed ; to the slips noted in the errata 
may be added 1719 for 1519 (vol. i., p. 47). 

The beginning, of Another volume in the " Cambridge 
modem industry Historical Series " is Professor W. 
and commercf. Cunningham's "Western Civilization 
in its Economic Aspects (Mediaeval and Modern 
Times)." This is really the second volume of the 
work : the first, dealing with ancient times, appeared 
in 1898. The definite object of this essay, as out- 
lined in the preface., is " to point out the remote 
and complicated causes in the past which have co- 
operated to mould industry and commerce into their 
present forms." In his division of the subject, 
Professor Cunningham recognizes " three great 
stages of progress, in man's knowledge of himself, 
and of his place and powers in the world ; and 
each of these has had far-reaching effects on indus- 
trial and commercial life. Under the influence of 
Christian teaching, man attained to a new con- 
sciousness of duty ; and we can trace the workings 
of these ideas in the institutions of Christendom 
as they are most noticeably seen in the age of St. 
Louis. Again, when the period of discovery came, 
man's conception of the earth and of the possibili- 
ties it contained were suddenly enlarged, and we 
find the influence of this new knowledge not only 
in the expansion of commerce but in the national 
economic policies, of which France under Louis 
XIV. affords a typical example. Lastly, with the 



age of invention there was an increase in man's 
acquaintance with physical nature, combined with 
special opportunities for applying that knowledge 
practically ; and Englishmen have taken the lead, 
not only as inventors but as pioneers in the work of 
diffusing the new industrial practices and organi- 
zation throughout the world. During each of these 
three periods attention has been concentrated in 
turn on one of the requisites of production. In 
mediaeval Christendom we find institutions for the 
regulation of labor ; the phase of nationalist eco- 
nomic policy has been chiefly concerned with the 
development of land ; while in recent times we see 
the remarkable results effected by the utilization 
of capital." It will be seen that this is a study of 
causes ; which explains, for example, the great 
prominence assigned to the circumstances which 
have made England paramount at sea, and have 
given to the Anglo-Saxon race its wide-reaching 
commercial and industrial influence ; while on the 
other hand the vigorous trading life of Italian 
cities in the Middle Ages, great and splendid as it 
was, is not regarded as very fruitful so far as after 
times were concerned. The whole of this second 
volume is even more profound and closely-wrought 
than the first ; and has a special interest for Ameri- 
cans in the fact that it embodies the substance of 
lectures delivered by Professor Cunningham at 
Harvard University in 1899, a fact which the 
Englishman gracefully recalls by dedicating the 
volume to President Eliot. 

A condte and The numerous Doo ^ 8 published of 
simple book late dealing with music and music 

onmusic. culture have contributed somewhat 

toward raising the standard of musical criticism 
and discussion in this country; and the newly 
awakened interest in musical literature has created 
a demand for books especially adapted to the uses 
of the general reader. In " Masters of Music " 
(Dodd), Miss Anna Alice Chapin has written a 
series of interesting sketches of famous composers. 
While not pretending to give an estimate of his 
position in the world of art, the author gives a brief 
account of the life and work of each great artist 
with one exception. We do not find Verdi in the 
list. Verdi is now to be numbered among the 
great ; and as a proof of the popularity of his music 
we have but to glance at any- season's repertory at 
the Metropolitan, where his operas outnumber those 
of all except Wagner. Perhaps Miss Chapin feels 
that with Palestrina, Scarlatti, Marcello, Pergolese, 
and Rossini, Italian music is sufficiently represented 
in her chronicle. The various sketches evince a 
thorough knowledge of the life of each artist; 
anecdote has been interspersed, though not too 
freely, with fact ; and the list of his famous com- 
positions which follows after the account of each 
artist is most desirable for reference. The author 
has had to face the difficulty which arises from the 
fact that writing of any sort about music is apt to 
seem to the casual reader very abstruse, and the 



272 



THE DIAL, 



[April 16, 



critical portions of the volume under consideration 
do not appeal particularly to students of music. 
The raison d'etre of the book seems to be to supply 
a concise and simple work on music, with biog- 
raphies of the composers and a characterization of 
their work. 

A study of I n " Choirs and Choral Music " 
choral music (Scribners) Mr. Arthur Mees, for- 
and composers. mer ly conductor of the Cincinnati 
May Festival chorus and present conductor of the 
New York Mendelssohn Glee Club, states that the 
two branches of musical study most neglected in 
this country are the study of unaccompanied choral 
music for mixed voices and the works of mediaeval 
composers. His volume is primarily a history of 
choral music, and, at the same time, a critical study 
of composers of that department of music. In the 
preface the author states that his book is not a com- 
pendium for the professional, but a book for the 
amateur which will tell him something about the 
beginnings and the course of development of chorus 
singing ; something about the origin of choirs, their 
constitution, and the nature of their activity at dif- 
ferent periods ; something about the history of the 
most important choral forms, particularly the Mys- 
tery and the Oratorio, about their essential char- 
acteristics, and about the first and other notable 
performances of the best known of them. It opens 
with an account of the development of music among 
the Greeks and Hebrews, the inheritors of the 
Egyptian and Assyrian theories, out of which grew 
the tone art of the early Christian, which has re- 
sulted in the choral of to-day. Then follows a his- 
tory of music in the early and mediaeval church, 
during the period of the Christian mysteries, with 
a sketch of the great composer of the Passions, 
Johann Sebastian Bach ; and a history of the Ora- 
torio under its famous exponent, George Frederick 
Handel. A chapter devoted to choral culture in 
this country reviews the conditions which led up to 
the organization of our singing societies, and the 
circumstances under which the choral institutions 
that were conspicuously instrumental in elevating 
the standard of chorus singing were established. 
The volume closes with some interesting observa- 
tions on the qualities necessary to the efficient 
chorus singer and chorus conductor, and a plea for 
the encouragement and promotion of choral culture 
in America. The book has an unusually accurate 
index. 

A judicious Pith, freedom from advocacy, and a 

manual of the just holding of the balance where 
French Revolution. aut h O rities differ, make Professor 
Shailer Mathews's sketch of " The French Revolu- 
tion " (Longmans) an unusually good manual on 
its topic for the general reader, or for the student 
who wishes to lay a sound foundation for further 
research. Nearly a third of the volume is devoted 
to the pre-revolutionary condition of France, for the 
author's aim throughout is to explain as well as de- 
pict the course of events. Professor Mathews is no 



votary of historical novelties, but he has neverthe- 
less availed himself of the work of recent special 
investigators wherever the new facts adduced by 
them point plainly to the need of a revisal of the 
conclusions of the older historians. We are espe- 
cially glad to note that the value of the book is not 
impaired by any concessions to that current spirit 
of paradox which courts notice through the catch- 
penny device of exalting bad men. Now that the 
maniacal Marat, who only escapes the distinction 
of being the worst scoundrel in the history of dem- 
agogy through the extenuating fact that he was 
half-crazy, is credited by a historian of repute with 
a statesmanlike mind and a leaven of apostolic vir- 
tue, we may expect any day to find history rushing 
to the advocacy of Carrier or Fouquier-Tinville, or 
devoting a volume or so of perverted ingenuity to 
the apotheosis of Hubert. Professor Mathews's 
book is judicial in tone and cautious in its conclu- 
sions, as a manual of the kind should be. Authori- 
ties are cited in the footnotes, and there is an 
interesting frontispiece portrait of Mirabeau after 
the original at Bowdoin College.

and salon, the Academy, the theatres, and so on, 
are vivaciously discussed in a series of crisp little 
chapters in which a turn for satire is manifest. 
Miss Lynch's nationality is sometimes amusingly 
evident, as where she assures us that the ladies of 
Dublin are better dressed than those of Paris 
which reminds one a little of Mrs. Major O'Dowd 
and the camelias at Ballymaloney, " as big as tay- 
kettles." In point of freshness, sparkle, and variety 
Miss Lynch has set a pace, so to speak, that the 
authors of the forthcoming volumes in the series 
will find hard to follow. The little book is attrac- 
tively illustrated with photographic plates, largely 
after suitable subjects by modern painters. 

A collection Much amusement may be derived 

of epitaphs, from the little volume containing a 

grave and gay. collection of epitaphs, ancient and 
modern, compiled by Mr. H. Howe, and entitled 
" Here Lies " (New Amsterdam Book Co.). That 
an inuendo lurks in the title may be inferred from 



1901.] 



THE DIAL

the fact that the book is provided with a frontis- 
piece reproducing Raphael's Death of Ananias. 
Mendacity, however, was not always the fault of 
the old epitaph-maker. The poet who wrote 
"Underneath this sod lies Arabella Young, 
Who on the 5th of May began to hold her tongue," 

certainly meant to perpetuate an unflattering truth ; 
and the couplet 

"Eliza, sorrowing, rears this marble slab 
To her dear John, who died of eating crab " 

is literalness itself. Mr. Howe's collection is a rich 
one in its kind, and the epitaphs are in many cases 
interesting as well as amusing. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. E. H. Sothern's acting version of " Hamlet " has 
been published in an inexpensive and exceptionally at- 
tractive volume by Messrs. McClure, Phillips & Co. 
It gives the text as used by Mr. Sothern during the 
past season, including several passages which he some- 
times omitted, by reason of the great length of the 
play, and is illustrated by means of a series of photo- 
graphic reproductions of the most striking scenes. The 
illustrations also include several character portraits, 
both of Mr. Sothern as Hamlet, and of Miss Earned a 
Ophelia. 

Daniel O'Connell was a California journalist who had 
a wide circle of friends and admirers. Among other 
things, he was a prolific writer of verse, which fact is 
attested by the volume of his " Songs from Bohemia," 
now edited by Miss Ina D. Coolbrith, and published at 
San Francisco by Mr. A. M. Robertson. The book is 
provided with a portrait, and with a biographical sketch 
by Mr. W. G. Harrison, who indulges in much flowery 
rhetoric, but fails to inform us of the dates of the 
poet's birth and death. 

Miss Mary F. Hyde's " Two- Book Course in English," 
published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co., consists of 
" Lessons in the Use of English " and a " Practical 
English Grammar, with Exercises in Composition." 
Miss Hyde is an experienced teacher of her subject, 
and is the author of other text-books that have been 
widely used in the elementary schools. 

The " Series of School Readings " published by the 
Messrs. Scribner now numbers thirteen volumes, the 
majority of which have been compiled under the editor- 
ship of Miss Mary E. Burt. The thirteenth of the 
series, now just published, is a condensation by Miss 
Burt, of Mrs. Elizabeth B. Custer's two books about her 
famous husband. It is called " The Boy General." The 
book should make capital reading for young people 
both in and out of school. 

If one may judge by the number of books about 
gardening that have been produced during the past five 
years, there is a new and more intelligent interest in 
this gentle art than has heretofore characterized us as 
a people. The latest book of the class now referred to 
is " A Handy Book of Horticulture " (Dutton), by Mr. 
F. C. Hayes. This is a book for gardeners of modest 
resources, and, although English in its origin, will not 
be without its uses, even under our own harsher cli- 
matic conditions. The author is a clergyman, which 
reminds us of the fact that gardening, in England, is a 
clerical avocation far more frequently than with us.

vertisement for the book. 

" Elements of the Theory and Practice of Cookery," 
by Miss Mary E. Williams and Miss Katharine R. 
Fisher, is a text-book for nse in schools, and is pub- 
lished by the Macmillan Co.

ciation with the Zuni Indian tribe of New Mexico. The 
price of the work will be $3.50. Information and sub- 
scription blanks will be supplied by the secretary, 
Washington, D. C. 

Professor Ashley H. Thorndike has published at 
Worcester, Mass., an interesting monograph entitled 
" The Influence of Beaumont and Fletcher on Shaks- 
pere." It was originally a doctoral dissertation, and 
is now enlarged to a treatise of nearly two hundred 
pages. 

An addition to the host of recent text-books in En- 
glish is the " Modern Composition and Rhetoric " of 
Messrs. Lewis Worthington Smith and James E. 
Thomas. It is published by Messrs. Ben j. H. Sanborn & 
Co., and appears to be a sensible and practical treatise 
upon its subject. 

A second edition, revised and enlarged, of Mr. W. D. 
McCrackan's "The Rise of the Swiss Republic" has 
just been published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It 
is now nearly ten years since this work first appeared, 
and its place among the standard histories has become 
well established during this period. 

" The Love Letters of Dorothy Osborne to Sir Wil- 
liam Temple " are far better worth reading than most 
of the modern love letters, real or fictitious, that have 
enjoyed such a vogue of late years. A new edition of 
this work, edited by Mr. Edward Abbott Parry, is now 
published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 

Dr. William Jay Youmans, for many years editor of 
the " Popular Science Monthly," died April 10 at his 
home in Mount Vernon, N. Y., at the age of 63. Dr. 
Youmans was well-known as a scientific worker, and 
was an extensive contributor to Appletons' Cyclopaedia 
and editor of many important scientific works. 

" Under Bobs and Kruger " is the title of a book by 
Mr. Frederick W. Unger, late correspondent for the 
London "Daily Express," which Messrs. Henry T. 
Coates & Co. will issue this Spring. Mr. Unger's book 
is perhaps unique as representing the work of an En- 
glish newspaper correspondent with the Boer army. 

Hitherto, Longfellow's " Hiawatha " has been the 
only American work included in the " Temple Classics " 
(Macmillan). We now have a two- volume edition of 
Emerson's Essays, first and second series, and " Nature," 
edited by Mr. Walter Jerrold, The photogravure 
frontispieces present a portrait of Emerson and a view 
of his Concord home. 

Messrs. Cooke & Fry issue in attractive form a vol- 
ume entitled "The Tarrytown Church Records," by 
the Rev. Dr. David Cole and Mr. Morris P. Ferris, 
president Yonkers (N. Y.) Historical Association. The 
book is based on the records of the " old Dutch church 
of Sleepy Hollow," now the First Reformed Church of 
Tarrytown, and is of much local historical and genea- 
logical interest. 

Messrs. Congdon & Britnell, of Toronto, announce 
their purchase of the library of the late Robert Jenkins 
of that city, comprising in all about 1200 volumes, 
engravings included. Mr. Jenkins was, for a number 
of years, an enthusiastic collector of Americana and 
Canadiana, and the library is rich in early and scarce 
works relating to the North American Continent. A 
catalogue will be mailed to those interested. 

We have seldom seen a more attractive auction cata- 
logue than that prepared for the William Harris Arnold 
collection of books and letters, which Messrs. Bangs & 

' O 



Co. will sell in New York on the 7th and 8th of next 
month. About three hundred books (mostly first edi- 
tions of English authors) and seventy autograph letters, 
including some notable treasures, are comprised in the 
collection. The catalogue is a large octavo volume, 
beautifully printed at the Marion Press. Many inter- 
esting letters of Keats, Wordsworth, Bryant, Lowell, 
and others are reprinted in full. The illustrations in- 
clude a reduced facsimile of the trial page for the pro- 
jected Kelmscott Shakespeare, and a facsimile of the 
complete holograph MS. of Keats's poem " To Charles 
Cowden Clarke."

THE OCTOPUS 

A remarkably strong story of the wheat-growers

"A Man's Woman," "McTeague," "Blix," etc. 

"When a genuine man appears with something to 
say and his own way of saying it, he should receive 
full and immediate attention. Such a man is Frank 
Norris, whose new book, 'The Octopus,' puts to shame 
the whole petty brood of imitators and marks the be- 
ginning of a new epoch in American literature. . . . 
He has grasp, power, purpose, and sincerity. ... In 
fertility and grasp of great themes there is to-day no 
one in America with whom to compare Norris. . . . 
He deals directly with men and conditions ... he 
writes about real men and women ... he is a poet."

This is the latest and best of the smaller biographical dictionaries, and

down to the death of Queen Victoria and the accession of Edward VII.

A Summer Hymnal A Romance of Tennessee 

By JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE. Illustrated by STANLEY M. ARTHURS, with a frontispiece by 

CLARE VICTOR DWIGGINS. 12mo, cloth extra, $1.25. 

Mr. Moore has much of the quality displayed by James Lane Allen in his earlier work 
" A Kentucky Cardinal." The scene of his story is laid in the blue-grass region of Ten- 
nessee, and his pages are rich with tender sentiment, shrewd philosophy, poetic feeling, and 
an exquisite humor. Those who have read his charming short story " Ole Mistis," will 
welcome his first novel, and new readers are sure to be delighted. " Old Wash," the negro 
character who figures in some of Mr. Moore's short stories, reappears in this book. 

Crankisms 

By LISLE DE VAUX MATTHEWMAN and CLARE VICTOR DWIGGINS. Square 12 mo, with 

100 full-page illustrative drawings, $1.00. 

Mr. Matthewman's biting, and sometimes cynical, satire is fully complemented by the 
delightfully witty drawings, which are in addition full of grace and beauty. The "Dwiggins 
Girl " reappears constantly throughout the series of pictures, and may perhaps become as 
much of a household word as " the Gibson Girl." 



By FREDERICK W. UNGER, War Correspondent of the London Daily Express. Illustrated 
with more than 150 half tones from the author's own photographs in the field. Crown 
8vo, cloth extra, $2.00. 

Experiences and observations of an American War Correspondent in the field with both 
armies. Mr. linger was present at Lord Koberts's early operations, and was then sent 
secretly by Mr. Arthur Pearson to correspond with his paper from the Boer side. His 
experience, as representative of an English paper with the Boer army, was perhaps unique, 
and he has given an absolutely truthful account of events as he saw them. The book will 
contain reproductions from some one hundred and fifty photographs taken by Mr. Unger, 
and will be a work of some considerable importance.

! The Tower of Wye A Romance 

By WILLIAM HENRY BABCOCK 

Illustrated by George Gibbs. I2tno, cloth extra; list price, $1.50. 

This is a story of early Maryland Colonial life, full of incident and 
interest. Mr. Babcock has, more artistically than any other writer, caught the 
atmosphere of haze and marvel through which newcomers to the Western 
World saw all things. His book is new in treatment, and holds the reader's 
attention fascinated from beginning to end. 

OCTAVE THANET says : " It seems to me the best thing you have done, and Richard 
Smith a right valiaut, noble gentleman. You have, I think, canght the spirit of the time." 

WILLIAM S. WALSH says : "I dare assert that of the historical romances that have lately 
appeared none is better than 4 The Tower of Wye.' It is a joyous story, redolent of youth 
and spring and the glory of the morning."

In Search of Mademoiselle 

By GEORGE GIBBS 

Illustrated by tbe Author . i2mo, clotb; list price, $1.50. 

Mr. Gibbs, the artist, in this, his first novel, deals with the romantic and 
highly picturesque episode in American history of the struggle between the 
French and Spanish for the possession of Florida. This furnishes the back- 
ground for a charming story of the love of an Englishman for Diane de la 
Notte, a French Huguenot of noble family, who has been exiled from her 
native land. 

CYRUS TOWNSEND BRADY says : " Mr. George Gibbs has chosen the most romantic and 
terrible episode in the whole range of American colonial annals as tbe historical basis of his 
vivid romance. He writes as he paints, with graphic force and spirit." 

JOHN HABBERTON writes : " I 've read your ' In Search of Mademoiselle ' with great 
interest. I must congratulate you on your success in retaining throughout the novel the old- 
time atmosphere in which you began. No writer of historical novels has done this better 
than you ; few have done it so well."

Dwellers in the 
Hills 

By MELVILLE D. POST, Au- 
thor of "The Strange 
Schemes of Randolph Ma- 
son," "The Man of the Last 
Resort." $1.25. 

This book is one of those 
rare productions a true 
romance. The action is com- 
passed by three days of 
stress and trial for the oddly 
named trio of central charac- 
ters : Quiller, Ump, and Jud ; 
but in that time the reader 
knows the joy and fear of 
striving with unseen foes, 
and many other things worth 
knowing, not the least of 
which are a plot unlike any 
other, and a style both nat- 
ural and unf orgetable. 
"Dwellers in the Hills" is 
a noteworthy book.

TRUTH DEXTER 

BY SIDNEY McCALL 10th Thousand Now Ready 
12mo. Decorated Cloth. Price, $1.50. 



We do not hope to see it surpassed, even if equalled, in 1901. 

Philadelphia Telegraph. 

The author of '* Truth Dexter" at once takes his place among 
the foremost of the novelists of the day. Boston Transcript. 

Altogether the best novel of the month. Detroit Journal, April 6. 

There is no question that " Truth Dexter" will be the novel of 
the summer. Chicago Sunday Inter Ocean. 

For firmness of grasp, crispness of dialogue, and neatness of 
general writing, " Truth Dexter" might almost stand as a model. 

- Chicago Post. 

It deepens in interest with every chapter, and at the close is 
flooded with a light of delicate tenderness that is akin to genius. 

Boston Herald. 

Truth Dexter, the heroine, is one of the most lovable women in 
fiction. Literary Era. 

From the moment you catch sight of Truth Dexter you learn to 
love her. Pittsburgh Commercial Gazette. 

A story that is in every way truly great. ... It is a larger, 
broader, saner view of life and human nature that one gets from 
the book, and it is closed with the regret that is always felt in 
parting with a dear friend.-- Worcester Gazette. 

Bids fair to prove the most satisfactory novel of the year.

Mr. Moody bids fair to prove by his own work that American poetry has a promising

his subjects far from common. He has grace and humor as well as vigor of thought. 
Some of his poems lately printed in the magazines, notably " An Ode in Time of Hesita-

Autobiography of Dreyfus 

HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED 

UNDER THE TITLE 

FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE 

Seven years ago the tragedy and mystery of the Dreyfus 
case aroused the world, convulsed France, and held French 
officialdom up to shame before the eyes of civilization. 
Black chapter was added to black chapter in that drama 
of political and racial hatred and persecution ; forgery, 
perjury, disgrace, and suicide followed one after another, 
until no man knew whom the lightning might blast next 
and through it all the central figure, helpless on his rock 
in mid-ocean, kept an enforced silence. Now France has 
tacitly confessed her error, and Alfred Dreyfus, free once 
more, has given to the world his own account of the trial, 
condemnation, martyrdom, and release. " FIVE YEARS 
OF MY LIFE" is a book such as is not written twice in 
a century ; the very core of history, set forth, as it is, by 
the principal actor in one of the most remarkable polit- 
ical dramas of all time.

TEN YEARS OF MUSIC. 

The tenth season of the Chicago Orchestra 
has just come to an end, and the occasion seems 
to call for a few words of comment upon the 
history and purpose of this remarkable enter- 
prise. When the Orchestra was organized in 
the autumn of 1891, and its support for three 
years was secured by a subscription guaranty of 
fifty thousand dollars for each year of that 



term, there were not many who were hopeful 
enough to believe that it was destined to 
become a permanent part of the higher life of 
Chicago. So many worthy movements had 
come to grief in the city, so many fresh enthu- 
siasms had become chilled, so many commend- 
able enterprises had suffered untimely defeat 
from the caprices of fashion, that the argument 
from analogy seemed to indicate a like end for 
the newly-established Orchestra. When the 
three years of the original plan were ended, 
and the subscription fund had been overdrawn 
instead of being merely exhausted, the prospect 
was dark indeed, and it looked as if the work 
would have to be abandoned as a failure. But 
the forces which had led to its foundation 
proved equal to the new demands made upon 
them ; the public-spirited founders of the or- 
ganization renewed their subsidy, and the work 
has gone on ever since without any derogation 
from the fine artistic ideals that were set at its 
inception. The annual excess of expenses over 
receipts has fallen in the ten years from more 
than fifty thousand to less than twenty thousand 
dollars, but it still remains a charge upon the 
group of men who have borne it from the first, 
and who have, moreover, borne it ungrudg- 
ingly, conscious that they have been supporting 
one of the noblest of public causes. It is the 
gift of a third of a million of dollars freely 
made by these men to the community during 
the past ten years, that has enabled Chicago to 
boast of the finest orchestral organization and 
equipment in America. We will not seek to 
praise these men as they deserve, for they 
would be the last to wish for such praise ; it is 
perhaps the chief virtue of their gift to art that 
they have made it for the sake of art and not 
for the sake of their personal reputations. 

But in spite of the manifest devotion of these 
men to a higher ideal than that of money- 
getting, there are certain elements of public 
opinion so dense as to be incapable of realizing 
that the annual balance-sheet of the orchestral 
organization is not the chief source of concern 
to its management. Every year, when the 
figures are given out, and the deficit once more 
stares the public in the face, a cry goes up from 
the newspapers to the effect that the loss might 
easily have been avoided by bringing the pro- 
grammes presented down a little nearer to the

level of popular taste. Give us more " request 
programmes," it is said, put in a few waltzes 
and medleys of operatic airs, and the public 
will crowd the concert hall. This is true, no 
doubt, but it is jiot the wish of the manage- 
ment to secure large audiences at such a cost. 
The Orchestra is first and foremost an educa- 
tional enterprise, and the requirements of art 
are held paramount by Mr. Thomas and his 
supporters alike. Those who cannot under- 
stand how practical men may be actuated by 
such a motive should fall on their knees and 
pray for enlightenment, instead of assuming 
the injured air of persons whose good advice 
is ungratefully rejected. Yet the advice is 
proffered year after year by the same perse- 
vering critics, and it seems quite impossible to 
convince them that it is not wanted, or that 
the men who are responsible for the work> of 
the Orchestra know quite as well as their critics 
that the concerts could be made to pay if it 
were thought desirable. 

How well they have paid in a better than 
the commercial sense is apparent to every ob- 
server of musical conditions in Chicago during 
the past ten or twenty years. By dint of per- 
sistent hammering at the public, of giving the 
public what was good for it instead of what it 
wanted, Mr. Thomas has transformed the great 
modern composers, one by one, from esoteric 
mysteries into sources of vital enjoyment. To 
begin with, he forced Wagner upon an unwil- 
ling public until those who had come to scoff 
remained to pray, and a Wagner programme 
had come to be the surest means of filling the 
house from pit to topmost gallery. Then he 
dealt with Brahms, and Tschaikowsky, and 
Dvorak in similar fashion, and made them 
almost equally popular. Yet while pursuing 
this course, he did not permit the public to 
neglect the great composers who were in less 
need of such championship, and the works of 
Bach and Mozart and Beethoven were produced 
with generous frequency. Certain it is that 
the programmes which now attract the largest 
audiences are of the sort that would have been 
most certainly doomed to failure in the early 
years of the missionary and educational work 
done for Chicago by the devotion of this un- 
bending idealist. The largest audience that 
ever assembled for a concert in the Chicago 
Auditorium an audience that filled all the 
seats and packed the foyer behind the seats 
with the dense rows of the standing was the 
one that gathered there a few weeks ago to 
hear a programme consisting of two sym- 



phonies and a concerto for piano and orchestra. 
As recently as ten years ago this achievement 
could not possibly have been realized. 

During the ten years that the Chicago 
Orchestra has exercised its beneficent ministry, 
over two hundred programmes have been pre- 
pared, and each of them twice performed, once 
in the afternoon and once in the evening. The 
list of the works produced at these concerts 
comprises practically the whole repertoire, of 
the modern orchestra, and makes a most im- 
posing showing as printed in the last concert- 
book of the season just ended. It includes, for 
example, sixty symphonies, by nearly half that 
number of composers. Of these symphonies 
one hundred and seventy double performances 
have been given, the C minor of Beethoven 
heading the list with twenty afternoon and 
evening presentations. The forms of the con- 
certo, the concert overture, the suite, the 
rhapsody, and the symphonic poem are repre- 
sented in equally rich variety, and nearly all 
the great works for solo performance likewise 
appear in the list. Taking the name of Beet- 
hoven alone, we find, besides fifty double per- 
formances of the nine symphonies, more than 
fifty double performances of other numbers. 
Wagner is represented by almost everything 
that can possibly be used for concert purposes, 
over sixty distinct numbers being included in 
the programmes, with nearly three hundred 
double performances. The above facts and 
figures will give some faint idea of the musical 
feast set before the Chicago public during the 
past ten years by Mr. Thomas and his musi- 
cians. It has provided nothing less than a 
liberal education in music for many thousands 
of people, and the community as a whole with 
a spiritual uplift that no psychological calculus 
has the power to estimate. For this best of 
gifts we wish to express our appreciation and 
to record our heartfelt gratitude to the men at 
whose hands it has been received. 



ALEXANDER CALDWELL McCLURG. 

The death of Alexander Caldwell McClurg, on 
the 15th of April, deprived the business and in- 
tellectual life of Chicago of one of its most con- 
spicuous figures. General McClurg was born in 
Philadelphia in 1834, and was educated at Miami 
University. He enlisted as a private in the Civil 
War, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel 
and Brevet Brigadier General. His military record 
was one of distinction ; he took part in the battles 
of Stone River, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge,

and Atlanta, besides accompanying Sherman on his 
famous march to the sea. After the war he came 
to Chicago and engaged in the hook business, at 
first with S. C. Griggs & Co., then with Jansen, 
McClarg & Co., and finally became head of the 
firm of A. C. McClurg & Co., which was reorgan- 
ized as a stock company about two years ago, with 
General McClurg at its head. The bookselling 
business of this house grew to great dimensions, 
and the publishing department, although less im- 
portant, attained a highly respectable development 
under the personal direction of the head of the 
house. General McClurg was actively interested 
in many of the organizations of the intellectual 
forces of the city, particularly in the Chicago His- 
torical Society and the Chicago Literary Club. He 
also did much valuable work in behalf of the Ameri- 
can Copyright League. The events of recent years 
ranged him stanchly on the side of the traditional 
political ideals of his country, and the cause of 
anti-imperialism found in him an energetic and 
outspoken ally. THE DIAL owes a special tribute 
to his memory, both because of his frequent contri- 
butions to its pages, and because the firm of which 
he was a member was part owner of the journal, as 
well as its publisher, during its first twelve years. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



CONCERNING TRAGEDY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Inasmuch as play-goers have been seeing tragedies 
ever since the time of JEschylus, and probably long be- 
fore, it would seem an easy thing to say what tragedy 
is. Yet it has proved to be not an easy thing at all. 
Aristotle apparently settled it for his own time, but his 
ears must have burned during the last three centuries, 
and still nothing is decided. 

The latest word comes from Prof. E. E. Hale, Jr., 
who in a recent number of THE DIAL takes issue with 
Mr. W. L. Courtney * for presenting the leading idea of 
tragedy as a conflict, and himself maintains that its 
essential element is really " the strange and unexplain- 
able courses of life." 

The first theory is certainly incomplete. It would 
follow from it that all plays are tragedies, since no real 
plot can be constructed that is not based on conflict of 
some sort. Obviously, we must also consider the nature 
of the conflict, the manner of its course and termina- 
tion, and the character of the participants. Briefly 
stated, it seems to me that the conflict must involve 
great suffering, otherwise it is simply heroic (instance 
the Heracles), or comic (instance Falstaff); that it 
must end in failure, and that this failure we must, as 
we look back, feel to be inevitable, that is, in accord- 
ance with law, and not the result of arbitrary fiat or of 
accident; finally, the fighter himself must be a great 
nature, since otherwise he can neither greatly suffer nor

Courtney." I have as yet been nnable to see the book, so 
know it only through Mr. Bale's criticism. 



greatly contend, and our interest in him cannot be last- 
ing. Ibsen's " An Enemy of the People " is not a 
tragedy, because its hero, Stockmann, does not fail; he 
wins, and at the end of the play he is more fit than at 
the beginning. The same is true of "A Doll's House ": 
Nora has struggled somewhat as one does in a dream, 
but by the .end of the play she has waked, and is ready 
to make a real fight of it, with a life-time ahead in 
which to do battle, and not for herself alone. Haupt- 
mann's Haunele, on the other hand, is not a tragic but 
apathetic figure: she suffers but does not fight; she is 
a helpless child done to death by a brutal fate, but 
comforted at last by her radiant death- visions. " The 
Second Mrs. Tanqueray " shows conflict, and inevitable 
failure, and suffering, but fails of greatness because its 
characters, eccentric or clever or charming or whatever 
else, are fundamentally mediocre ; whereas " Magda " 
("Die Heimath"), though less clever, is greater, by 
reason of its heroine and her superb vitality. 

But while the conflict-theory fails through incom- 
pleteness, the mystery-theory, as we may call Professor 
Bale's, fails rather through a confused use of terms, 
and this in a number of ways. 

" Hamlet," we are told, is tragic because we do not 
understand it. " As soon as we understand it, it ceases 
to be tragedy." And the tragedy lies, it appears, in 
the fact that, though endowed with such gifts as ought 
to bring success of the best kind, he yet does not suc- 
ceed, and we cannot see why. Yet it is admitted that 
we do see how, for " when the conditions are once given, 
we do not deny a single step." What, then, is seeing 
why, if it is not just this seeing how things happen, this 
following their course step by step from beginning to 
end? Do we, or can we, in any other sense see why 
anything happens, from the processes of digestion to 
those of the poet's fancy? Unless, indeed, we expect to 
fathom what we, by misleading anthropomorphism, call 
the " motives," of what we, again by misleading anthro- 
pomorphism, call " the Creator." And inasmuch as the 
same mystery lies over all things, we cannot regard it 
as the special ear-mark of a particular class. 

Again, " The Second Mrs. Tanqueray " is deemed 
tragic because "although we know that she could not 
have turned over a new leaf (gluing the old ones 
down), we are not at all clear as to why she could not. 
It seems as if she should have had a chance." On the 
contrary, Mrs. Tanqneray's case appears to me a par- 
ticularly clear one, both in its nature and in virtue of 
its presentation; nothing could be easier to understand, 
in the only way in which we can ever understand any- 
thing. 

The tragic element in " L'Aiglon " is accounted for 
as in ' Hamlet." Professor Hale thinks the Duke, " on 
the whole, an attractive man with a good head and 
heart and great ambitions. People love him ; he ought 
to do well. Now he does not do well at all." But here 
again there seems to me nothing mysterious. I should, 
indeed, prefer to describe the Duke as an attractive 
boy with a poor head, diseased sensibilities, and spec- 
tacular dreams, but Professor Hale himself admits his 
" besetting triviality," and in fact explains satisfactorily 
just why the Duke could not possibly " do well." There 
is in it no "strange unexplainableness," except, as sug- 
gested above, of the sort that all things possess. We 
may, if we like, make a mystery of the fact that 
anaemic though attractive boys do not succeed, and that 
great fathers sometimes have unsuccessful sons, but 
there is not much to gain by it. According to my way 



296 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



of thinking, " L'Aiglon " is not a tragedy at all, but a 
pathetic spectacle, like " Hannele " done on a gorgeous 
scale, wherein, by means of a series of rather loosely 
connected scenes, we see the spirit of a lovable child 
bruised and crushed by the relentless forces of life. 
There is nothing worth calling a struggle ; he does not, 
as the slang phrase goes, " put up any fight at all." 

It seems, then, as though the mystery-theory involved 
us in confusion as to what " seeing why " really means. 
But perhaps the trouble is caused by a failure to dis- 
tinguish between the argument of a play and the play 
itself. Professor Hale has two minds about " Hamlet," 
one when he thinks of the story, another when he thinks 
of the play : when thinking of the first he " cannot see 
why it should have happened at all," when thinking of 
the second he " does not deny a single step." Note 
that it is the second mood which is induced by the play 
itself, the mood, not of querulous mystification but of 
compelled understanding, which accompanies our sense 
of the tragic. It is not while we follow the play that 
we " do not see why," it is only when we repeat, in 
barren and meaningless formula, the story of the play. 
This argument rather makes against its own cause, in- 
dicating that our feeling of the tragic and our under- 
standing of its inevitable processes are at least con- 
comitants. In discussing " A Doll's House," Professor 
Hale again mistakes the material of the tragedy for the 
tragedy itself. It cannot, he argues, be the conflict 
between husband and wife that makes it tragic, because 
" a brawling house is not tragic." Not when thus form- 
ulated, certainly, but it has been made the basis of more 
great tragedies than any other one subject. He adds 
that this particular brawl " was an extraordinary case, 
or perhaps it only seemed so because of the skill in 
putting the case." Exactly. In other words, it was 
the writer's skill which made it to some extent into a 
tragedy. Curiously enough, all great tragedians have 
this skill: Lear's was a brawling house, too; so was 
Agamemnon's, and Antigone's, and Beatrice Cenci's. 

In Professor Hale's discussion of " Hamlet " there is 
a further confusion of terms : " Granted that Hamlet 
was too weak of will, how did he get so ? By too much 
thinking ? Is not thinking the great faculty of man, the 
thing that raises him above the beasts ? Why should 
too much thought put the thinker in the power of the 
circumstances around him ? We do not understand 
these things." But the difficulty here is that Professor 
Hale is using the word " thinking " in two senses, as a 
general term for human reason, of which we cannot 
have too much, and as a special name for a special 
kind of activity which we all know does, speaking pop- 
ularly, interfere with effective action. And we all know, 
too, in a general way, the reasons why it does thus 
interfere. Take a real instance : An old professor was 
sitting in a street car with his legs crossed, reading, 
when he suddenly realized that he had passed his cor- 
ner. He arose hastily and tried to leave the car, but 
having neglected to uncross his legs he found it diffi- 
cult, almost impossible. What was his trouble ? Too 
much thinking; which thus actually had "put him in 
the power of the circumstances around him." Thinking 
may do this at any time, and no mystery about it; it all 
depends on the circumstances, and on how and what 
one thinks. In this case the lowest of the " beasts," 
even a hen, would have done better than the professor. 

The mystery-theory, then, does not appear to me as 
a satisfactory solution of the problem. I rather believe 
that the reverse of it is the truer, and that it is in so 



far as we do, in the only way possible, understand the 
course of evil, so that it becomes a part of the great 
world-order to which we belong, that it appeals to our 
tragic sense. So long as it appears unaccountable, 
arbitrary, so long shall we feel impatience and rebellion, 
so long shall we be withheld from experiencing with 
regard to it the " pity and fear " which, whatever is 
meant by them, are admitted to be the essentials of the 
tragic attitude. Caliban's notion of Setebos "just 
choosing so" admits of suffering and of conflict, but 
not of tragedy, and the arbitrary postulate, as it seems 
to us moderns, in the " CEdipus," is its weakness, not 
its strength. 

It is this understanding of evil, this seeing through 
it, seeing how, which it is preeminently the tragedian's 
business to endow us with ; if he fails of this, he has not 
written a tragedy, but a melodrama, or something else. 
Thus, Professor Hale holds that while " Hamlet " is a 
tragedy, the death of a young man in battle is not. 
Granted, but why ? Not because we understand the 
evil involved; I do not think we do, the Providence 
that governs battlefields seems quite as inscrutable as 
the Providence that governs royal murders; but be- 
cause such a death, glorious or pathetic according to 
one's point of view, is what we call accidental: the 
bullet happened to come his way. An artist may arise 
who will take such a story and make it seem to us in- 
evitable, but no one has yet done so. Perhaps the 
nearest approach to it is in " Romeo and Juliet," where 
the catastrophe is the outcome of a series of unfortunate 
accidents, any one of which might have turned out dif- 
ferently and saved the game. But I think the play 
only helps to prove the point, for it has never seemed 
to me a great tragedy, when compared with the great- 
est; it seems a sweet and pathetic love-story, like that 
of " Paul and Virginia," and I have never been able to 
see anything very shocking in the German acting ver- 
sion which arrested the poison and the dagger, and 
allowed the lovers to live happily ever after. Moreover, 
it is significant that a class of college girls, when I re- 
ferred to the play casually as a tragedy, almost unani- 
mously protested. Everything, they argued, was going 
well, the plan of escape, though a stupidly complicated 
one, might easily have succeeded, and they refused to 
consider a play tragic which held within itself even up 
to the last moment the possibility of a happy solution. 
When asked about " Lear," and the happy solution 
which used occasionally to be substituted at its close 
by our German (and, alas! English too) play-managers, 
they held that the case was different; that here the 
tragedy lay not in the death of Lear but in his life, 
and that even if he had ended his days in comfortable 
senility, tended by Cordelia, his life would have been 
none the less a tragic failure, and inevitably a failure. 

It is, then, not " strange unexplainableness " that 
makes tragedy, nor is it conflict alone. Tragedy gives 
us something different from the one and something 
more than the other. It shows us great suffering, mortal 
conflict, great natures, and as it shows us these it makes 
us feel that they, and we, are in the grasp of eternal, 
unalterable law. The suffering and the struggle, when 
apparently outside the dominion of law, arouse in us 
only extreme rebellion or sullen non-resistance; when 
manifestly within its realm, they stir in us those feel- 
ings of " pity and fear " which are our response to 
what we call great tragedy.

AUGUSTUS HARK To DATE.* 



" What fun ! " cheerily ejaculates Mr. Au- 
gustus Hare, of guide-book fame, in a letter 
to a friend, after telling how the Reviews had 
been abusing him for what they thought the 
twaddle, conceit, toadyism, inordinate length, 
and so forth, of the first instalment (in two 
volumes) of his autobiography. Even the 
staid " Athenaeum " for once lost its temper, 
and called Mr. Hare a " literary valet," the 
" British Review " went so far as to think him 
*' an absolute beast," a critic out in India voted 
him and his " chatter " a " prodigious nuis- 
ance," an American paper politely hinted that 
so erratic a Hare must surely be one of the 
March variety, and, in fine, Mr. Hare must 
have felt as if the good old days of Jeffrey and 
Lockhart were come again for his express en- 
tertainment. 

Bent on having more " fun " of this unusual 
sort, Mr. Hare now puts forth a second brace 
of much thicker volumes on the same seductive 
theme, and gleefully awaits the result. We 
are sorry to disappoint him of our small con- 
tribution to the treat he has promised himself, 
but we must in candor say that his book, though 
long and of no great substance, strikes us 
nevertheless as a really entertaining one in its 
way, and even as an almost ideal book to pick 
about in and dawdle over in the dozy Summer 
days, when one is content to keep cool and 
drift along idly on the stream of almost any- 
body's talk. It is, furthermore, to our notion, 
a book that reflects, not " an absolute beast " 
(how the " British Review " could speak or 
think thus of the winsome and accomplished 
Augustus passes our comprehension), but an 
amiable, talkative gentleman, who, if he some- 
what too manifestly has a high opinion of him- 
self, has at all events come by it honestly. For 
Mr. Hare has long been a very popular writer 
with that large class of occasional readers who, 
when they like a man's books, like them with- 
out stint or qualification, and are eager to tell 
him so, rapturously, when they meet him in the 
flesh. Numerous admirers of Mr. Hare, as we 
gather from his pages, have praised him to his 
face, and gratefully told him how their steps 
had been led and their minds uplifted by his 
incomparable guide-books and pious family

memorials, and how much, how very much, the 
name of Augustus Hare meant to them. Few 
men's natural modesty, however great, could 
have withstood that sort of thing very long ; 
and it is no wonder if Mr. Hare, living thus 
daily within earshot of his own praises and 
basking in the sun of his great social popu- 
larity, has come at last to " take himself pretty 
seriously," and even to feel it incumbent on 
him to climb to the general view on a pedestal 
of autobiography four volumes high. 

We deplore as much as anybody what Mr. 
Gosse calls the "big-biography habit," and we 
think that a writer who has contracted it ought 
to be suppressed and kept out of print until 
time and abstention have effected a radical 
cure. The practice of exhibiting one-volume 
men in two-volume and even three-volume 
books has increased, is increasing, and ought 
to be diminished, even if an example has to be 
made of a contumacious biographer or two. 
But in Mr. Hare's seemingly aggravated case 
of making much ado about comparatively noth- 
ing, it ought in fairness to be observed that 
what he calls the story of his life is in point of 
fact so largely made up of stories about and 
by others, and of impersonal descriptions of 
places he has visited in his capacity of quasi- 
professional tourist and guide-book maker, that 
it may be read with interest even by those who 
care least about Mr. Hare himself. Mr. Hare's 
habit of Boswellizing even his chance and un- 
important acquaintances, of jotting down their 
talk and especially their stories, is largely re- 
sponsible for the length of his book. Telling 
in his journal, for instance, how he breakfasted 
with a Mr. Richmond he relates how his host 
" Talked of Carlyle of how his peculiarities began 
in affectation, but that now he was simply lost in the 
mazes of his own vocabulary. One night, he said, he 
met a man at Albert Gate at 12 p. M., who asked for 
a light for his cigar. He did not see who it was till, 
as he was turning away, he recognized Carlyle, who 
gave a laugh which could be heard all down Piccadilly 
as he exclaimed, ' I thought it was just any son of Adam, 
and I find a friend.' " 

Carlyle was tormented by street noises. He 
said to Mr. Hare : 

"That which the warld torments me in most is the 
awful confusion of noise. It is the devil's own infernal 
din all the blessed day long, confounding God's warks 
and His creatures a truly hell-like combination, and the 
warst of it a' is a railway whistle, like the screech of ten 
thousand cats and ivery cat of them as big as a cathedral." 

In his diary Mr. Hare tells amusingly of a 
dinner at the Grotes'. 

" After dinner, she (Mrs. Grote) would leave ' the 
historian,' as she called him, in his study, and come up 
to the drawing-room, where she would talk to her

guests and be most entertaining. At nine o'clock, tea 
would be brought up such a tea as one never sees 
now, with tablecloth, muffins, cakes, etc. Then she 
would say to the servant, ' Bring up the historian ' 
and the historian was ' brought up.' He was vastly 
civil, of the old school, and wore a great deal of frill. 
He would take his place opposite the table, and im- 
mediately taking a large clean pocket-handkerchief 
from his pocket, spread it very deliberately over his 
knees, after which a dog jumped up and sat on it. Then 
he would say, as to a perfect stranger, ' And now, Mrs. 
Grote, will you kindly favor us with a sonata? ' and 
Mrs. Grote, who was an admirable musician, would play 
a very long sonata indeed; after which he would say, 
' Thank you, Mrs. Grote. I am sure Lady Lyvedon 
joins with me in being very much obliged to you for 
your beautiful sonata.' " 

Mr. Hare's impressions of Tennyson, as re- 
corded in his diary, will not please the poet's 
admirers who would have no spots on their sun. 

"... This afternoon I have been with Mrs. Gre- 
ville to Mr. Tennyson at Haselmere . . . Tennyson is 
older looking than I expected, so that his unkempt ap- 
pearance signifies less. He has an abrupt, bearish 
manner, and seems thoroughly hard and wnpoetical: 
one would think of him as a man in whom the direst 
prose of life was absolutely ingrained. Mrs. Greville 
kissed his hand as he came in, which he received with- 
out any protest. He asked if I would like to go out, 
and we walked round the gardens. By way of break- 
ing the silence I said, 'How fine your arbutus is.' 
Well, I would say arbutus,' he answered, < otherwise 
you are as bad as the gardeners, who say Clematis ' . . . 
For the poet's bearish manners the Tennyson family 
are to blame, in making him think himself a demigod. 
One day, on arriving at Mrs. Greville's, he said at once, 
' Give me a pipe, I want to smoke.' She at once went 
off by herself down the village to the shop, and return- 
ing with two pipes, offered them to him with all be- 
coming subservience. He never looked at her or 
thanked her, but, as he took them, growled out, " Where 
are the matches ? I suppose now you've forgotten the 
matches!'. . . Dined at Lady Lyvedon's. Sat by Lady 
S., who was very pleasant. She talked of Tennyson, 
who had been to stay with her. He desired his sons 
to let her know that he should like to be asked to read 
some of his poems in the evening. Nevertheless, when 
she asked him, he made a piece of work about it, and 
said to the other guests, ' I do it, but I only do it be- 
cause Lady S. absolutely insists upon it.' He read 
badly and with too much emotion: over 'Maud' he 
sobbed passionately." 

Glad, no doubt, to have escaped the spec- 
tacle of a man " sobbing passionately " in 
public over his own poems, Mr. Hare was 
nevertheless compelled to hear Browning read 
at Lady Airlie's, and it was a sore trial to him. 

" I never heard any one, even a child of ten, read so 
atrociously. It was two of his own pieces ' Good 
news to Ghent ' and Ivan Ivanowitch,' the latter 
always most horrible and unsuitable for reading aloud, 
but in this case rendered utterly unintelligible by the 
melodramatic vocal contortions of the reader." 

The following passage from Mr. Hare's 
journal seems in general fairly characteristic, 



and may serve to indicate a certain quality in 
his writing which is the one, we fancy, largely 
responsible for the irritation of his critics. 

"I was afterwards at a breakfast at Lord Bute's. 
There were few people I knew there, and the grass 
was very wet, so I sat under the verandah with the 
Egertons. Presently an old lady was led out there, 
very old, and evidently unable to walk, but with a dear 
beautiful face, dressed in widow's weeds. She seemed 
to know no one, so gradually I do not know how it 
came about I gave her a rose, and sat down at her 
feet on the mat, and she talked of many beautiful 
things. She was evidently sitting in the most peaceful 
waiting upon the very threshold of the heavenly king- 
dom. When I was going away she said, ' I should like 
to know whom I have been talking to.' I said, ' My name 
is Augustus Hare.' She said, ' I divined that when you 
gave me the flower.' I have not a notion who she was.'* 

Mr. Hare's book, it must be admitted, ia 
largely a chronicle of pretty small beer, but it 
is entertaining enough, as we have tried to 
show, in its light way. The volumes are pro- 
fusely illustrated, mainly with woodcuts set in 
the text, which assist in making an unusually 
inviting page. Of his own portraits the author 
has been lavish. E. G. J. 



THE SCIENCE OF MEANING.* 



Etymology is a science, said Voltaire, in 
which vowels count for nothing and consonants 
for mighty little. Since then there has arisen 
a science of language at whose bar every slight- 
est dialectical variation and shadow of a breath- 
ing is required to justify its existence, and the 
old gibe has lost its force. But the etymology 
of which Voltaire spoke was essentially the 
etymology of the ancients. It was a more or 
less ingenious and plausible playing of the 
fancy about the transitions of meaning by 
which one word arises out of another. At its 
worst, it was a refined form of punning. At 
its best, it was a convenient vehicle for the con- 
veyance of ethical and assthetical symbolism, 
as it appears in the etymologizing of Plato and 
Plutarch, or in Ruskin's interpretations of the 
proper names in Shakespeare. Plato derived 
hemera, day, from himeros, desire, because 
primitive man, reversing Shelley's practice, 
passed the night in terror-stricken longing for 
the dawn. Aristotle deduced dikaios, just, 
from dicha, in twain, because justice is a fair 
division. The Stoics, in Cicero's phrase, labored 
pitifully in enucleating the origins of words. 
And the moderns before this century were not

much better. The great Scaliger himself de- 
rived persona from peri soma, around the 
body. But there is some naivete in the modern 
scholar's triumph over the ignorance of his 
predecessors. Superior minds, such as Plato 
and Plutarch, were well aware that etymolo- 
gizing, like the allegorical interpretation of 
mythology and poetry, was merely a literary 
device. They did not take their fancies so 
seriously as we are apt to assume. But in the 
absence of verified scientific law, it was impos- 
sible for even the greatest thinkers to acquire 
the modern educated man's instinctive sense of 
the possible and impossible in this field or in 
the world of physical phenomena. 

But truth is stranger than fiction and quite 
as interesting. The miracles of fairy land are 
eclipsed by the realities of modern science, and 
etymologies on which philology has set its 
austere seal present as good material for the 
kaleidoscopic play of fantastic associations, as 
the uncontrolled fancies of pre-scientific literary 
ingenuity. Why resort to romance to derive 
Alfana from equus if science permits us to dis- 
til glamour from grammar, kneads dough into 
fiction, demonstrates the identity of wig and 
Mount Pilate, extracts eel and quinsy from 
the same root, and equates tear and larme, 
while warning us that there is nothing in com- 
mon between boucher and boucfte, kaleo and 
call, holos and whole, auge light and Auge eye? 
And wherein is the notorious antiphrasis lucus 
a non lucendo funnier than the admitted deri- 
vation of paraffin from parum affinis, too little 
akin ? Until recently, however, this fascinating 
field has been abandoned to the popular essay- 
ist, or invaded by the philologer only for the 
purpose of culling a casual flower or two to 
commend his severer wares. But of late there 
has been a demand that this domain too be 
annexed by science, and brought under the 
reign of strict philological law. Monographs 
have been written on the development of mean- 
ings in particular classes of words, as numbers, 
verb-forms, words of color, or the names of the 
operations of the mind. And here and there 
a scholar emulous of Holmes's coleopterist, and 
adopting a term introduced by the gram- 
marian Reisig about the year 1830, has de- 
nominated himself a semasiologist, or student 
of the science of meanings. The most enthu- 
siastic advocate of the new study is Professor 
Michel Breal, best known to scholars for his 
edition of the Eugubine Tables and his etymo- 
logical Latin Lexicon. After many years' de- 
lay, and the anticipatory publication of various 



popular papers on the theme, he about two 
years ago put forth a volume to which, with a 
slight modification of the current term, he gave 
the name " Semantiqye." And this, translated 
under the title " Semantics " by Mrs. Henry 
Gust, and introduced in an interesting and 
suggestive though somewhat rambling essay by 
Professor Postgate, now lies before us. 

Professor Breal has written a charming book. 
Has he constituted a new science ? Apart 
from a few modifications of terminology, has 
he anything to offer that is new I will not 
say to the student of recent German seniasio- 
logical work, but even to the reader of Max 
Miiller, Trench " On the Study of Words," or 
the ingenious author of " Stories from the Dic- 
tionary " ? I think not. 

Of the three divisions of Professor Breal's 
work, only the second part, " How the Mean- 
ing of Words is Determined," belongs to his 
subject taken in the stricter sense. The first 
part, though entitled " The Intellectual Laws 
of Language," is mainly concerned with forms 
and inflections, and together with the third 
part, " How Syntax is Formed," falls under 
semantics only if we make the word cover 
everything in the science of language not in- 
cluded in sound change. Now the phenomena 
of semantics in the larger as in the narrower 
sense are primarily special manifestations of 
the association of ideas, and can with a little 
ingenuity be grouped under a few broad rubrics, 
such as association by similarity or antithesis, 
or contiguity in time or place, or causal se- 
quence, expansion and restriction of meaning, 
specialization, generalization, concretion, ab- 
straction, metaphor, analogy, confusion, con- 
tamination, survival, and the like. The number 
of such categories actually employed in any 
given treatise, and the precision and subtlety 
with which they are discriminated, depend 
more on the logical idiosyncrasy of the author 
than on any inherent and constraining order in 
the phenomena. Mr. Breal's tripartite division, 
while conducive to clearness in some respects, 
is unfavorable to his design of eliciting a few 
simple laws. It leads to over-subtlety of classi- 
fication and the multiplication of terminology, 
a malady of science quite as serious as the 
abuse of abstract and metaphorical language 
which he so sensibly deprecates. 

Thus what he calls the law of specialization 
is illustrated in Part One by the tendency of 
words of originally substantive import to be- 
come specialized as mere signs of grammatical 
relations. It is in this way that the transition 



300 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



from synthetic to analytic languages is ex- 
plained. It is a misleading metaphor, Mr. 
Breal thinks, to say that the case endings de- 
cay and are replaced by prepositions and a 
fixed syntactic order. What really happened 
was that the Latins, seeking precision, fell into 
the habit of saying dare ad aliquem instead of 
dare alicui, and then the terminations no longer 
needed were discarded. These considerations 
are interesting, but the term specialization 
could be and has been applied within the field 
of Semantics proper to the facts which Mr. 
Breal relegates to another book and chapter 
under the heading " Restriction of Meaning " 
the narrowing, that is, of extension and 
deepening of intension by which, e. g., tectum 
becomes the special covering toit. So with 
" differentiation," Mr. Breal's second law. As 
applied to vocabulary it is virtually equivalent 
to the " desynonymization " of Trench. The 
classical illustration of this process is found in 
"Ivanhoe," in Wamba's reflections on sheep 
and mutton, oxen and beef, and it is manifested 
when advancing thought sharply discriminates 
for its convenience terms like genus and 
species, brigade, regiment, battalion, esteem, 
respect, venerate, whose etymology supplies no 
necessary basis for such distinction. But the 
term also includes the process by which the infi- 
nite wealth of Greek and Sanscrit verb-forms 
are appropriated to separate functions, and for 
this reason Mr. Breal treats of it in Part One. 

The phenomena which many scholars lump 
under analogy Mr. Breal distributes into sev- 
eral groups. He coins, e, g., the term " irradia- 
tion " to denote the process by which a depre- 
ciatory subaudition attaching to a few words 
of the originally innocent termination aster 
spreads and irradiates into all words of like 
ending giving MS poetaster and maratre. Under 
analogy proper he discusses rather the psycho- 
logical motives of the resort to analogy. And 
from the fact that there always is such a 
motive he concludes somewhat sophistically that 
we have no right to speak of false analogies 
as if they were mere blunders. We can un- 
doubtedly detect a method in the madness of 
children who say " I goed," or in the late 
Latin speakers who coined prostrare from 
prostravi, and developed etude from a supposed 
feminine studia. But common sense will con- 
tinue to speak of blunders and false analogies 
in spite of Mr. Breal's ingenious plea that such 
imperfect speakers are actuated by the highest 
impulse the search for regularity and law ! 

The second part, u How the Meaning of 



Words is Determined," treats of such topics 
as the restriction and expansion of meaning, 
metaphor, polysemia, etc., and, in final sum- 
mary, " How Names are Given to Things." 
These chapters with their wealth of apt illus- 
tration are very readable. But we cannot 
admit that they constitute even the beginning 
of a new science. That things are often named 
from one of their qualities taken as represen- 
tative of the rest, as when a horse was for the 
Aryans the swift thing par excellence, and for 
the modern Greek the irrational thing ; that 
meanings may be strangely narrowed, as when 
species becomes spices and ninth mood is lim- 
ited to courage ; or widened, as when pecunia 
becomes the symbol of wealth generally ; that 
metaphor is one of the chief ways in which the 
imagination creates new meanings, as when the 
first threads of the warp came to stand for all 
primordia and exordia ; that experts in every 
matter use abbreviated expressions the meaning 
of which is determined by the context, or by 
what the logicians call the " universe of dis- 
course," as when novellce means new vines to 
a farmer, and to a jurist laws added to the 
code of Justinian these and similar propo- 
sitions were not first enunciated or illustrated 
by the science of Semantics. It is an inter- 
esting fact (if true) that tempus originally 
meant temperature. But when Mr. Breal adds 
that then in French weather was thus desig- 
nated, and finally, the abstract idea of dura- 
tion, was reached, he will mislead readers who 
do not recall that Aristotle discussed the meta- 
physics of " time " with the word chronos (the 
including?) which in modern Greek has sunk 
to " year," while the kairos, or opportune 
moment, of Greek ethics and poetry now means 
weather. Such curiosities give us no law or 
principle ; they merely tell us that any incident 
or aspect of the passage of the hours or seasons 
may by historical accident become the sign of 
the abstract idea of time, and again be degraded 
to a trivial concrete meaning. The writer of 
a popular book on language naturally groups 
and arranges his examples, as a psychologist 
classifies his anecdotal illustrations of the as- 
sociation of ideas, or a rhetorician invents an 
elaborate nomenclature for different kinds of 
metaphors. But after the enunciation of a 
few general principles or pathways of associa- 
tion, there is no scientific law in either case 
to determine the number of the headings and 
subdivisions. They may as well be thirty as 
ten. It is purely a question of literary skill 
and convenience of presentation of the ma-

terial. But the classifying and name-giving 
instinct is ineradicable, and its excesses are a 
perpetual source of illusion here, and in the 
neighboring fields of grammar and literary 
criticism. And so while agreeing with Mr. 
Breal that Semantics is a much more interest- 
ing and, in its unsystematic way, more in- 
structive subject than the study of vowels and 
consonants, we cannot admit that it is or can 
be a science even in the limited sense in which 
the term is applicable to what has hitherto 
been known as comparative philology. Nor 
has our opinion been altered by the perusal of 
Professor Wundt's recently published "Volk- 
erpsychologie." He demonstrates with super- 
fluity of logic that every change of meaning 
has a cause. But so has every action of man. 
We do not therefore regard political history 
as a science. There is doubtless a reason why 
the French word for liver (foie) is derived 
fromjicatum (fig-fed) and not from jecur ; or 
why pig(e) in Danish means what the French 
call a " young person," and not the less poet- 
ical young thing to which it is limited in our 
own tongue. But the reason in each instance 
is historical and (for purposes of human sci- 
ence) accidental. Such facts cannot be con- 
verted into a science by the application to 
illustrations taken from Trench and Breal of 
Wundt's own ponderous subdivision of what 
the rest of us call associations into assimilations, 
complications, and apperceptions. We are 
none the wiser for being told that the familiar 
metaphor from sight to sound in the phrase 
" a clear voice " (clarus) is a case of " primary 
complicative Bedeutungswandel " falling under 
the formula ndA (E B)ndE (AB)-neB. 
We are only moved to apologize to Mr. Breal 
for finding fault with the excessive complication 
of his terminology. p AUL SHORET. 



A GLIMPSE OF OLD NASSAU.* 

The crude material without which history 
could not be written or the historical novel 
launched on its record-breaking career, is pre- 
sented to the reader in the Journal and Letters 
of Philip Vickers Fithian, as edited by Mr. 
John Rogers Williams for the Princeton His- 
torical Association. Ill-spelled, worse punctu- 
ated, and well-nigh without literary form or 
grace of style, these extracts from an observant

young man's private papers are still vastly 
entertaining and instructive, in detached pas- 
sages : their humor being all the richer because 
unconscious, and their instruction the more 
welcome because unpremeditated. 

Fithian was born in New Jersey in 1774 ; 
studied at Princeton, 1770-72, at the same 
time with Henry Lee, Aaron Burr, and James 
Madison ; devoted himself to the study of 
theology after leaving college ; acted as tutor 
in Councillor Robert Carter's family, West- 
moreland County, Va., 1773-74 ; was sent as 
missionary among the pioneer settlers of West- 
ern Virginia and Pennsylvania ; enlisted as 
chaplain in the New Jersey militia, July 12, 
1776 ; served under Washington ; and died of 
camp epidemic, Oct. 8, 1776. 

Manners and customs at Old Nassau are 
described in his Princeton letters. A few ex- 
tracts may be of interest to present students. 

" Every Student must rise in the Morning, at farthest 
by half an hour after five ; the grammar Schollars being 
most of them small, & lodging also in Town at some 
Distance from the College, are, in Winter, excused 
from attending morning Prayrs. 

" The Bell rings at five, after which there is an 
Intermission of half and [sic] hour, that everyone may 
have time to dress, at the end of which it rings again, 
& Prayrs begin; And lest any should plead that he 
did not hear the Bell, the Servant who rings, goes to 
every Door & beats till he wakens the Boys, which 
leaves them without Excuse." 

" After morning Prayrs, we can, now in the Winter, 
study an hour by candle Light every Morning. 

" We breakfast at eight; from Eight to nine, is time 
of our own, to play or exercise." 

" We sup at seven ; At nine the Bell rings for Study ; 
And a Tutor goes through College, to see that every 
Student is in his own Room ; if he finds that any are 
absent, or more in any Room than belongs there, he 
notes them down, & the day following calls them to 
an Account. 

" At nine any may go to bed, but to go before is 
reproachful." 

" We rise on Sabbath mornings & have Prayrs as 
usual." 

" two of our Members were expelled from the 

College yesterday; not for Drunkenness, nor Fighting, 
not for Swearing, nor Sabbath-Breaking; But they were 
sent from this Seminary, where the greatest Pains and 
Care are taken to cultivate and encourage Decency, if 
Honesty, fy Honour, for stealing Hens ! Shameful, mean, 
unmanly Conduct ! " 

Religious interests appeal to him strongly. 
He mentions the revivals, the " stir of religion 
in college," as he expresses it, to which Dr. 
Maclean, in his History of the College of New 
Jersey, has made more extended reference. 
The young student notes with satisfaction the 
conversion of some of his college mates. " The 
formerly abandoned Glover " is spoken of as

" seeking the way to heaven "; but, as the 
editor adds, poor Glover " appears to have 
mistaken a path to some neighboring hen-roost, 
for the way to Heaven, as he was expelled 
from the college the following winter for steal- 
ing turkeys." The fashion in college pranks 
has certainly changed since Fithian's day. 

The greater part of the volume is devoted 
to the Virginia diary and letters. Like William 
Ellery Channing twenty-five years later, Philip 
Fithian went from college to a tutorship in a 
Virginia gentleman's family ; like him he was 
meanwhile fitting for the ministry ; like him 
he was sometimes homesick ; and like him 
he was debarred for pecuniary reasons from 
much of the gay life of the Old Dominion. 
He, no less than Ghanning, noted the differ- 
ences, social, moral, and temperamental, be- 
tween the Southerners and the Northerners. 
" The people are extremely hospitable," he 
writes, " and very polite, both of which are 
most certainly universal Characteristics of the 
Gentlemen in Virginia." He adds, however, 
that " some swear bitterly, but the practice 
seems to be generally disapproved." In de- 
scribing " Miss Priscilla," Councillor Carter's 
eldest daughter, he says : 

" She is small of her age, has a mild winning Pres- 
ence, a sweet obliging Temper, never swears, which is 
here a distinguished virtue, dances finely, plays well on 
key'd instruments, and is on the whole in the first Class 
of the female Sex." 

The condition of the negroes is deeply de- 
plored by Fithian, as it was later by Channing 
under very similar circumstances. A peck of 
corn and a pound of meat was the total weekly 
allowance of provision to each slave on the 
Carter plantation. The inhuman punishments 
inflicted on offenders by neighboring slave- 
owners are described. " There is a righteous 
God," adds the diarist, " who will take venge- 
ance on such Inventions." 

The Journal records the traits of school-boy 
and school-girl nature, ever old yet ever new, 
which the writer notes in his young charges 
from day to day. Bob is flogged by his father 
for trying to shirk the dancing lesson by con- 
cealing till the last moment his shoeless condi- 
tion. Another pupil is in trouble with vulgar 
fractions. The girls amuse their teacher by 
aping the ways of their elders. A note for 
the naturalist is the New Jersey diarist's sur- 
prised comment on Virginia's exemption from 
mosquitoes late in July, too ! Apparently 
the Jersey variety of that insect was famous 
even in colonial times. 



The latest entry from the Journal is dated 
Oct. 25, 1774. A selection from Fithian's 
later correspondence and diaries, if such are 
preserved, ought to be of value. The editor's 
Introduction leaves the reader at least a faint 
hope that another volume may be forthcoming.

A DICTIONARY OF ARCHITECTURE.* 



Up to the present time some excuse was to 
be made for the architect, in this country, and 
for the student and lover of the building arts, 
who have not had within easy reach an English 
Dictionary of Architecture. An important and 
expensive Dictionary of Architecture was com- 
pleted some seven years ago, after forty years 
spent in its making, by a society organized for 
its publication in England, but few copies 
found their way to this country, and the field 
has been open to whomever should enter it 
with a satisfactory work of the kind. Mr. 
Russell Sturgis's recent work, " A Dictionary 
of Architecture and Building," has, therefore, 
every opportunity of success. It is now prac- 
tically completed, one volume being in print, 
one in press, and the third and final one in 
manuscript. Mr. Sturgis, who has borne the 
heavy burden of editorship, came to his task 
well equipped to perform the duties assigned 
to him, and his assistants are all men eminent 
in the arts and crafts of which they write. 

Glossaries and encyclopaedic articles exist, 
and the general dictionaries may be depended 
upon for definitions, and also for pronunciation, 
along which line the work under consideration 
makes no move. It comprehends, however, 
the function of glossary and encyclopaedia, 
defining words and subjects alphabetically 
arranged, and expanding definitions into de- 
scriptive articles varying in length from a short 
paragraph to several thousand words. A sys- 
tem of cross references, well applied and exten- 
sive, enables the student to view a particular 
object from many sides and to behold it in its 
relation to kindred sorts, while to each special 
article is appended a list of books, etc., in 
which the subject under consideration may be 
further and more broadly studied. This feature 
makes this Dictionary of great value in a ref- 
erence library. 

The definitions in the main have been fur-

nished by Mr. Van Brunt and Professor Ham- 
lin. Mr. Sturgis has contributed many articles 
but has left the longer to specialists in the 
various fields : thus Messrs. Blashfield. Crow- 
inshield, and La Farge write on painting and 
color decoration ; Messrs. Hutton and Purdy 
write on structural engineering ; Mr. William 
Paul Gerhard writes ou sanitary science ; Mr. 
W. R. Letharby on design ; Professor W. C. 
Sabine on acoustics ; Mr. Charles A. Platt on 
gardens ; while Messrs. R. Phene Spiers, C. H. 
Blackall, R. Clipston Sturgis, and Professor 
Hamlin write of the Architecture of Asia- 
Minor, Belgium, England, and Egypt, respec- 
tively. Mr. Barr Ferree has furnished a list 
of the more important churches of Western 
Europe, with notes on each, to supplement the 
article on Churches. Sixty specialists, of whom 
the above are fairly representative, have con- 
tributed to the work. 

Not only in the historical and descriptive 
departments is the work strong, but also in the 
department of biography. Mr. E. R. Smith, 
of the Avery Architectural Library, has con- 
tributed liberally in this field, furnishing the 
bulk of the material furnishing, as a matter 
of fact, a goodly portion of the entire con- 
tents of the Dictionary. To each of the biog- 
raphies Mr. Smith has appended a list of the 
buildings designed by the architect in question, 
and also, following the system used throughout 
the Dictionary, has added a list of the works 
which may be studied in further pursuit of the 
subject. In the matter of ascribing buildings 
to their proper designers, the work has been 
done in so thorough and scholarly a manner, 
original sources being sought and carefully 
sounded, that the result is a trustworthy pre- 
sentation of the fruits of the best knowledge. 

Referring again to the contributors, it is 
noted that of the sixty or more on the list, two 
are Frenchmen resident in France, two En- 
glishmen resident in England, one an American 
resident in Italy, and the remainder all of 
them resident in America, so that, while Amer- 
ica has not developed a national architectural 
style, it cannot be laid at her door that she 
has not artistic and technical knowledge, skill, 
and vitality, sufficient to produce a compre- 
hensive Dictionary of Architecture. 

The work commends itself alike to the prac- 
ticing architect and to the layman, and pos- 
sesses so high an order of merit, and is so 
much of an undertaking, that it were almost 
ungracious to look for flaws. But faults do 
manifest themselves, both in the text, which 



contains examples of distorted perspective, and 
among the illustrations, which now and again 
are lacking in lucidity and pointedness. For 
instance, the Alhambra is dismissed with eight 
short lines and two illustrations which in no 
way represent the structure, while Casas 
Grandes receives four times the number of 
lines and no illustration. The Alhambra is 
one of the best known piles in the literature 
of history and romance, and a sympathetic 
word concerning it would not have, been amiss. 
The presentation of the drawing of the struc- 
tural work in the " Court of the Lions " is as 
though one dealing with the topic of Humanity 
should present a model skeleton in illustration. 
As there is no cross reference to "Moorish 
Architecture " or to " Court," the subject pre- 
sumptively is dismissed. The cut which is 
intended to illustrate the term " Alley " does so 
very blindly, in fact not at all ; while the 
building represented appears again in a full 
page half-tone plate to illustrate the term, " Cor- 
belling," which it does with equal blindness. 
The plate, however, makes a pleasing picture, 
which probably accounts for its introduction. 
The Editor deserves sincere thanks for drawing 
his illustration of " Collegiate " Architecture 
from the " real thing " rather than yielding to 
any temptation to present the exotic types 
which in their Eastern form are " Academy " 
Architecture, and in their proposed Western 
form are of the " Exposition " type of building. 
It is in the illustrations, however, that the 
work is weakest. They are drawn, as the text 
says, from many sources, and evidently no 
pains have been taken to create a uniformity 
either in method of reproduction or in scale. 
Reproductions of not too perfect wood-cuts are 
met on the same page with not too perfect re- 
productions of crude pen-drawings. The idea 
of proportioning the size and number of plates 
to the importance of the subject, seems not to 
have presented itself. While there are but 
few illustrations one would wish to have omitted 
altogether, there are points at which other 
illustrations would have been of service, notably 
in the fairly comprehensive article on Apart- 
ment Houses, which is illuminated with a half- 
tone plate of a Parisian Apartment house but 
contains no plan from the French, who are 
masters in this special line of design. 

But the defects are lost, almost, in the mass 
of well edited, pertinent material, and the 
shortcomings, possibly, are the unavoidable 
accompaniment of the speed with which the 
work has been produced ; for that, considering

GILBERT WHITE OF SEL.BORXE.* 



How mysterious, how incalculable, are the 
quality and the circumstance which give the 
work of a man's hand and brain a hold on 
immortality. How little can he who puts his 
imprint on the product of his thought and 
sends it forth to effect its purpose in the world, 
foresee the influence it shall have and the 
length of life it shall attain. 

A hundred and fifty years ago there dwelt 
in an obscure village in the southern portion of 
England a quiet-minded clergyman, following 
the simple routine of daily duty which his 
tastes and his profession opened out to him. He 
was uncompanioned in his pursuits, and the 
solitary master of the " Wakes," a picturesque 
old house surrounded by ample grounds in- 
cluding garden, orchard, meadow, and wood- 
land. The spirit of the naturalist animated 
him, affording him in his seclusion sources of 
endless, unaffected delight. Every object 
within the range of his activities excited curi- 
ous inquiry and stimulated him to close obser- 
vation and research. He studied the character 
and habits of the wild creatures round about, 
he learned the ways of the trees and the plants, 
he noticed the peculiarities of the soil and the 
rocks, and of the past life they entomb, and 
marked the variations in the seasons with a 
vigilant scrutiny. 

Not an aspect or a mood of Nature passed 
him unnoted, and each, marked by a feature 
of importance, was stamped with minute par- 
ticularity upon his retentive memory. There 
was an incessant gathering of interesting facts 
which had not before been reported for the 
benefit of science at large. The gentle curate 
had no means of measuring the value of his 
investigations. He was following the bent of 
his inclinations in single-heartedness and purity 
of aim. Love set him on to the work, and the 

* THE NATURAL HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES of Selborne, 
and A Garden Kalendar. By the Reverend Gilbert White,

duction to the Garden Kalendar by the Very Reverend

trations by J. G. Eenlemans, Herbert Railton, and Edmund J. 
Sullivan. In two volumes. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co. 



honesty of his mind kept him true to the per- 
formance of it. 

Selborne lies but fifty miles southwest from 
London, and it was the custom of the parish 
curate to leave his retreat by times for a brief 
communication with the life of the metropolis. 
He went up in the Spring of 1767, and came 
in contact with a man of like interests with 
himself, Thomas Pennant, Esq., a scientific 
writer of considerable authority, especially in 
the department of ornithology. Thence arose 
a correspondence between the two gentlemen 
which has made the name of Gilbert White 
famous in the annals of natural history. 

For thirteen years these missives were de- 
spatched from the " Wakes " at Selborne, each 
one couched in formal yet unaffected style, and 
each laden with carefully considered, carefully 
recorded observations of the phenomena of 
Nature in the restricted region of the parish. 
The scope, variety, and accuracy of the writer's 
investigations alike excite our wonder, while 
the simplicity, the tenderness, the oblivion of 
self manifest in his character draw us to him 
with affectionate admiration. He was the first 
of the students of Nature to glean his knowl- 
edge exclusively from personal investigation, 
who affirmed only that which he had proved, 
who was patient and trustworthy in experiment 
and conclusion. And these prime qualities, 
unconsciously entertained by him, have been 
duly appreciated among men of science. 

The letters to Thomas Pennant, and a simi- 
lar set addressed to the Honorable Daines 
Barrington, were published in 1789 under the 
general title of " The Natural History of Sel- 
bourne." A translation into the German ap- 
peared in Berlin in 1792. The death of Gil- 
bert White occurred in 1793, and since that 
date over eighty editions of his book have been 
produced. Naturalists of eminence, as Sir 
William Jardine, Professor Bell, Frank 
Buckland, and Grant Allen, have in turn taken 
the work in hand, and by additional letters 
and other matter, revised and annotated, en- 
hanced the worth of the original form. 

It is included in Sir John Lubbock's list of 
" the best hundred books," and is regarded 
universally as a classic in the library of the 
naturalist. Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, of the British 
Museum, who is the editor of the beautiful 
edition of " Selborne " now before us, remarks 
in his introduction to the volumes : 

" I have pondered a hundred times on the wonder- 
ful fact that the world should take such a heart-felt 
interest in the work of a retiring and modest eighteenth-

century clergyman! . . . Apart from Westminster 
Abbey, Windsor Castle, and other places of historical 
interest in the British Islands, there is probably no 
place, save Stratford-on-Avon, to which the pilgrims 
of the Anglo-Saxon race render more respectful tribute 
than to the lowly head-stone which marks the grave 
of Gilbert White of Selborne. The occupant of that 
simple grass-grown grave would probably have been 
the most astonished of all people in the world could he 
have realized that his celebrity as an Englishman would 
have come near to equalling that of Shakespeare; and 
yet there exists at the present date as much affection, 
among naturalists at least, for the sayings and doings 
of Gilbert White as is felt for the records of Shake- 
speare and his time." 

But little is known of the life-history of 
Gilbert White. In his writings self was put 
behind him, yet it could not be kept out of 
sight. Enough was visible to make us long 
to know more. He was a fellow of Oriel Col- 
lege, Oxford, and held a curacy under his 
uncle Charles, Rector of Bradley and Vicar of 
Swarraton. His family were people of position, 
and he had evidently leisure and means. A 
biography is promised in the near future by 
the present editor of his works, and from his 
enthusiasm and the material at his command, 
we may expect as full and authentic a narrative 
as can at this late date be made out. 

The two-volume edition which Dr. Sharpe 
now presents, is in all respects worthy of 
praise. Every pains has been taken to do 
justice to the memory and the achievements 
of Gilbert White, and the book stands as the 
loving tribute of one of the foremost of modern 
naturalists to one who served science nobly in 
its early stages a century and more ago. The vol- 
umes are richly illustrated with nearly two hun- 
dred full-page drawings and an almost equal 
number of smaller size. g ARA A. HUBBAKD.

where is it more declared than in religion. Religious 
belief, which had become remote, obscure, and 
speculative, is now earnestly interrogated on all 
sides, and incessantly asked for its vouchers. And 
yet in spite of this clamor of inquiry which has 
been so annoying to many persons, the period is 
marked by an accumulation of religious facts and 
religious experiences which places it above, not 
below, beyond, and not in the rear of, other periods. 
This is seen in the books before us. A portion 
are theoretical, apologetic, and comparatively inef- 
fective. Another portion are practical, and stand 
for a temper that is conquering the world. 

" Reasons for Faith in Christianity " and " Scien- 
tific Evidences of Revealed Religion," though quite 
diverse in form, are very like in purpose and spirit. 
The main object of each of them is the defense of 
the Bible as a special, preeminent, divine revela- 
tion, a revelation that does not so much crowd 
other revelations into the background as exclude 
them altogether. Dr. Leavitt, the author of the 
first volume, is exclamatory in style, and expects to 
carry the defenses of the enemy with a rush. His 
words are full of enthusiasm, and are fitted to give 
much satisfaction to those who entertain the same 
opinions as the speaker the method is that of a 
speaker rather than that of a writer and who 
wish only to have them confirmed. Dr. Leavitt has 
information rather than knowledge. He does not 
make a well-defined point and bring his knowledge 
to bear closely upon it. He covers a wide range of 
themes, such as one might find in a series of dis- 
courses. What he says on hypercriticism would 
have point if it were only put less sweepingly. 

Dr. Shields, the author of the second book, has a 
lucid, pleasing, and persuasive style, and one whose 
first impression is of carefulness and candor. This 
first judgment is not fully sustained when we weigh 
up the entire discussion. He regards the divine 
revelation in the Scriptures as " infallible and in- 
errant, the very word of God." And yet, when he 
has made all the allowances which he is inclined to 
make for the personal qualities of the writer, the 
circumstances of the time, the intelligence of those 
to whom the word was addressed, and the errors 
incident to transcription, we are hardly able to see 
in what this special divine element consists. The 
nature of inspiration cannot be blurred advantage- 
ously in such a discussion as this of the evidence of 
revelation. In what exactly does a special inspira- 
tion consist, and what is the proof of it ? Much of 
the proof that the author offers is not pertinent to 
the discussion. If the fact that the astronomical 
implications of the Scriptures are more frequently 
than otherwise consistent with the facts of Astron- 
omy proves special inspiration, then the text-books 
on Astronomy, still more exact in their agreement, 
should also be a Revelation. 

The author lays considerable emphasis on the 
assertion that we cannot regard the Bible as errant 
in science and history and inerrant in ethics and 
religion. To this we make no objection. Indeed, 



306 



THE DIAL 



[May 1, 



portions of the Bible seem more plainly errant in 
morals than in any other direction. There could 
hardly be a spiritual enigma more insoluble and 
confusing than the assertion that God sent pesti- 
lence to consume the people because David had 
unwisely numbered them. 

Neither of these authors seems to have the 
slightest apprehension that Christianity is not very 
closely associated with these theories, and is not 
likely to suffer from their failure. On the other 
hand, this notion of inspiration they regard as lying 
at the very centre of belief. It may be important to 
a given doctrinal system, but it has very little to do 
with a divine life. 

The next two volumes are of a very different 
spirit. Though not offered as defenses of Christian- 
ity, they subserve that purpose more effectively 
than the two which precede them on our list. 

" The Age of Faith " indicates an author more 
impressed by the new hold of men's minds on re- 
ligious truth, than by the sceptical attacks which 
the outworn attitudes of belief have suffered. In- 
deed, this very scepticism is often but another 
expression of faith. The burden of the book is the 
Fatherhood of God, and it is fitted to bring in- 
struction, courage, and contentment to many minds. 

Dr. Bradford is an excellent example of a " suc- 
cessful preacher " both words used in their best 
sense suited to the time in which he lives. 
Dogma plays but a small part in his volume. The 
iron in the smelting pot is thoroughly fused, and 
comes forth a glowing stream ready for the mould 
in which it is to be cast. The method of presenta- 
tion is literary and impressional rather than philo- 
sophical. A mind and heart, warmed by the 
divine goodness, strive to make that goodness more 
tangible to man, and this with reasons that appeal 
to every man's life. 

That the underlying philosophy does not always 
touch bottom is seen in the brief Introduction, which 
affirms two incompatible things : Revelation brought 
to the test of reason, and an infallible guide. In- 
fallibility cannot be a living pertinent fact to a 
thoroughly fallible man, whose primary dependence 
is his own reason. 

" Jesus Christ and the Social Question " is a book 
to which we wish to give the warmest welcome, 
both for its own sake, and because of the aptness 
of its message. It is a book of diligent inquiry 
and wise insight not of information but of 
knowledge. No one interested, both in social 
growth and Christianity, can afford to overlook it. 
It is the spirit of Christianity brought to the very 
world in which that most divine revelation has been 
made. It helps to unite -the two, the mind of Christ 
and the wants of men, in a Kingdom of Heaven. 
Here is defence where alone an adequate defence 
can be found, in a simple exposition of the Christ- 
like temper as a fact among the facts of this human 
spiritual world of whose needs we know something. 
It treats specifically of the teaching of Christ in 
connection with the family, with wealth, the care 



of the poor, and industrial order. If the flood of 
religious literature casts ashore occasionally such a 
volume as this, let it remain at high-water mark. 

Dr. Gordon is so profoundly interested both prac- 
tically and speculatively in the present wide and 
general changes of faith as to make his words 
stimulating, aside from any exact agreement with 
his conclusions. He offers a favorable example of 
a deeper concurrence in the present force of our 
religious life than that formed in a system of belief. 
" The New Epoch for Faith " expresses the en- 
thusiasm with which he regards the present move- 
ments in the religious world. The last portion of 
the volume is occupied with a forecast of the de- 
velopments which are to be anticipated in social 
and spiritual life ; and the body of the book, with 
the influences which are to contribute to this growth. 
Chief among these influences are the broader, 
deeper sense of human life ; the new appreciation 
of the true Christian temper which comes with it ; 
the discipline of doubt ; the rooting of faith in fresh 
soil ; the better interpretation of history. Salvation 
is thus deeply incorporated in the human spirit, 
and in its spiritual unfolding. It is no more to be 
missed or to miscarry than are the great purpose 
and process of Creation. 

One can not anticipate many readers for " The 
Philosophy of Religion," though he can not fail to 
recognize the knowledge and industry of the author. 
It is a history of the doctrine of theism in England 
and America since the reformation. Indeed, simply 
as an historical sketch, it is capricious, omitting and 
including authors according to the interest felt in 
them by the writer. As a critical production, it is 
too fearfully analytic. Everything falls apart. 
There is no synthetic purpose, no pushing of con- 
clusions to a definite result. Thus, more than 
ninety compact octavo pages are expended on an 
analysis of theism, which issues in thirteen distinct 
varieties, each to be presented at length in a series 
of writers. One must have great interest in naked 
facts to get pleasure out of such a presentation. 
This simple rehearsal of facts without handling 
them is to most persons wearisome and barren.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The Italy 
of the artists. 



A book on " Italian Cities " (Scrib- 
ners), by Mr. and Mrs. Blashfield, 
makes us at first feel a desire for 
pictures ; we want illustrations. This may be rather 
unreasonable, for we believe that the painting of 
cities is not exactly Mr. Blashfield's forte. Perhaps 
we are led astray by recollection of Mr. Pennell's 
drawings and etchings for Mr. Howells. These 
sketches (non-pictorial) are very different from 
those of Mr. Howells, who writes as an observing 
traveller, having his guide-book quite frankly in 
hand or in his trunk. Such a one needs pictures, 
and is lucky to have Mr. Pennell instead of having

to depend on photographers. Mr. and Mrs. Blash- 
field do not themselves appear much in their book. 
The papers are historical and artistic, chiefly (of 
course) on history and art in the Renaissance. 
Well-worn as much about Italy has become, we 
have here a good deal which if not new is at least 
not hackneyed. Rather out-of-the-way places, 
Florence, of course, and Siena, but also Ravenna, 
Spoleto, Parma (because of Correggio), Cortona, 
Assisi, Mantua. Still, so much is written of Italy 
and read even to-day, that it is a bold hand that 
writes a new book. Not only Mr. Howells comes 
to mind, but the differing reminiscences of Mr. 
Hewlett with his earthwork, M. Paul Bourget and 
his so-called sensations, not to mention Vernon 
Lee's tortuous dialogues and musings among the 
ilex-groves and other such places. Mr. and Mrs. 
Blashfield do not strike a new note a good deal 
of the book is of the highly-colored imaginative 
tapestry sort of revival of the glowing and glorious 
life of the Renaissance centuries, and for this, we 
confess, we do not care. It is apt to surfeit ; it is 
sweetness not long-drawn-out but thick-spread-on. 
Aside from this " word-painting," however, there 
is a good deal that is simpler and surer in touch, 
and that really gives some of the specific aspects of 
the time and more particularly some of the artistic 
qualities of the masters. Thus it is pleasant to 
hear that Giotto did not neglect stuffs, and paint 
blades of grass because he wished to glorify God, 
but because he was quite sincere in being as real- 
istic as he could be and in pushing his work as far 
as he could go : since he was unable to paint stuffs 
as well as blades of grass, he omitted detail in one 
and inserted it in the other. This example of the 
way an artist looks at the thing is interesting to a 
generation fed on the art-criticism of moralists. 
There is a good deal that is interesting in the book ; 
two volumes are a little cloying, but no one need 
read them all at once. 

The Century Co. have made a hand- 

8ome book o Sir Walter Besant's 
interesting articles on "East Lon- 
don," with the illustrations by Messrs. Phil May, 
Joseph Pennell. and L. Raven-Hill. The present 
volume, unlike the author's previous books on 
London, has little to do with history or antiqui- 
ties, for the reason that the area described in it 
can hardly be said to have either. East London 
that is to say, the area lying east of Bishopsgate 
Street Without and north of the Thames, the region 
east of the river Lea, and the aggregation of now 
conterminous towns that were once the suburban 
villages called Hackney, Clapton, Stoke Newington, 
Stepney, etc. is virtually a modern industrial 
city, a swarming hive of trade and manufacture, as 
unlike its ancient neighbor of Westminster as sooty 
Glasgow is unlike the picturesque and storied con- 
geries of wynds and courts and time-worn structures 
that form Old Edinburgh. The distinctive note 
of Sir Walter's book on East London, as compared 



"Man- 

building." 



with its predecessors on " South London," " West- 
minster," etc., is its human and modern interest, 
its close portrayal of the elements and types that 
the seeing eye discerns in the outwardly common 
and prosaic hurly-burly of toil and traffic, coarse 
pleasure-taking, and headlong hunt of the guinea 
or, alas ! more often of the irreducible and indis- 
pensable halfpenny, that sums up life in the main 
at the East End. Sir Walter's pen is graphic, his 
knowledge of his theme exhanstless, and his soul 
is full of sympathy for the toils and sorrows, the 
dim-lit lives of London's workers in the rank and 
file ; nor does the hopeless human derelict, adrift, 
rudderless, and bound to no haven here below, fail 
to win his charitable, appealing word. The pic- 
tures have the uplifting touch of art, and a word of 
praise must be given to the felicitous cover-design. 

When the author of " Man-building " 
(Scribner), Dr. Lewis Ransom Fiske, 
tells us that he " sought a title for 
this book which would clearly express its character," 
he explains without enlightening. This " Treatise 
on Human Life and its Forces " is composed of an 
introductory, a psychological, a physiological, and a 
sociological part. Out of this composite is supposed 
to emerge a potent elixir that shall arouse the talents, 
quicken the energies, and enlarge the opportunities 
of the young. The volume is in fact added to an al- 
ready swollen literature without any genuine raison 
d'etre. It is composed without insight, written 
without adornment or attraction, scattered through 
and through with vague and pointless generalities, 
displays a painfully weak grasp on the vital issues 
that are presented, and has no powers to charm, 
instruct, impress, enlighten, or (to add in fairness) 
mislead. Good intentions do not furnish a highway 
for profitable or attractive travel ; on the contrary 
we are proverbially informed that paving of this 
kind is in use in the dwelling-places of moral failure. 
Neither do fervor and interest furnish the means 
for an intellectual success. Criticism is misdirected 
against such a work as " Man-building " ; it is suf- 
ficient to point out its negative significance, its fail- 
ure to contribute anything to the information or 
the inspiration or the accessibility of the world's 
knowledge. It has, indeed, the weakly exhortative 
and strongly tiresome tone that we encounter when 
we take down from a neglected shelf a dusty volume 
of ' moral and mental philosophy " of a half-century 
or more ago. 

As an unvarnished account of actual 
life before the mast in the merchant 
and the naval service, we have read 
few books as good as Mr. Stanton H. King's " Dog- 
Watches at Sea" (Honghton). Mr. King, who 
sailed the brine, as boy and man, for twelve years, 
is now superintendent of the Sailors' Haven, 
Charlestown, Mass., a snug berth no doubt to bring 
up in after much knocking about in all sorts of 
ships and all sorts of weather. What we like most 
about Mr. King is that he is content to tell a plain

tale without " penny-dreadful " trimmings, and that 
he. does not plainly lay himself out (as even Mr. 
Bullen does sometimes) to " make your flesh creep," 
as the fat boy in Pickwick said to Mr. Wardle. 
Mr. King's adventures, stirring enough many of 
them, were of the regular kind that every sailor is 
bound to have if he sails long enough. He has a 
sensible word to say of the American deep-water 
ships, usually described as unmitigated "floating 
hells " officered by fiends incarnate. Mr. King 
admits that he has at times seen men wantonly 
abused by " bucko mates" on these vessels ; but he 
asserts, what everyone of experience knows to be 
true, that the precarious rule of the half-dozen of- 
ficers of a deep-water ship over the average ship's 
crew is in many cases only to be maintained by 
violence or a show of it. A sort of reign of terror 
has to be instituted at the start as the only alter- 
native to shirking, insubordination, and possible 
mutiny. Your " Christian captain " would get on 
beautifully with a Christian crew ; but the gang 
that usually herds in the forecastle of a deep-water 
ship is anything but Christian the more shame 
to us for it. Mr. King's in its kind capital book 
is handsomely printed, and it contains four accep- 
table pictures after drawings by Charles Copeland. 

Recollections of The little volume containing the 
M/Tme2Lw " Recollections of a Georgia Loyal- 
Revoiution. igt" (Mansfield), by Elizabeth Lich- 

tenstein Johnston, tells in artless style the story of 
the adventures and wanderings, during and after 
the war of the American Revolution, of the daugh- 
ter of one of the numerous Southern families who 
remained true to King and Parliament after the 
Colonies had declared for independence. After the 
success of the " rebellion " was assured there was a 
great exodus of " Tories," for of amnesty to the 
vanquished there was little or no sign. The author 
of the " Recollections " fled first to Florida, then to 
Scotland, then to the West Indies, and finally to 
Novia Scotia, where she settled, and where her 
descendants now form a family of social and political 
note. The narrative was penned by Mrs. Johnston 
in 1836, when she was seventy-two. As a family 
memorial it is doubtless of much interest ; and the 
general reader may find in it glimpses of a side of 
our early history not so familiar as it should be. 

The relation of " The Clergy in American Life and 
the clergy to Letters" ( Macmillan ), by Rev. 

American letters. Dan j el Du l anv Addison, aims, as 

the preface states, mainly " to tell the story of the 
influence upon American life and letters of the 
clergy during the national era of American litera- 
ture." The important qualification in the last 
clause accounts for the dismissal of Cotton Mather 
with half-a-dozen lines, and for the estimate of 
Jonathan Edwards in thrice as many. The plan of 
the book is to treat the work of a great many 
clergymen in four introductory chapters, and then 
to give a chapter each to Timothy Dwight, William 



Ellery Channing, Theodore Parker, Horace Bush- 
nell, Henry Ward Beecher, and Phillips Brooks. 
It may be doubted whether this assignment does 
not lay a disproportionate emphasis upon the six 
preachers selected, especially in view of the osten- 
sible purpose to show the relation of the clergy to 
American letters. It is, however, the preacher as 
such that one principally sees, although the titles 
of literary works, and frequently something more, 
are conscientiously given. A strictly literary his- 
torian would have allowed greater space to strictly 
literary work, and would have regarded the whole 
more consistently from the literary standpoint. 
The opening chapters call for a power to seize 
upon essentials, and to express them in clear and 
concise English, a power not always conspicu- 
ously present; but the chapters furnishing oppor- 
tunity to treat individual preachers at length are 
generally just, appreciative, and vigorous. It is 
no more than fair to say that the author manifestly 
is dealing with a familiar subject, upon which his 
genuine interest and prolonged study have been 
industriously employed. 

An interesting series of sea "yarns" 

and ^collections written by Mr. 

Frank T. Bullen for the " Spectator" 
are neatly reprinted in a volume of some 380 pages 
entitled " A Sack of Shakings " (McClure, Phillips 
& Co.). "Shakings," we find, is the name given 
to the odds and ends of rope and canvas accumu- 
lated on sailing-ships during a voyage, which were 
formerly the perquisites of the Mate. The term 
aptly describes the somewhat miscellaneous contents 
of the present volume, which is, however, lifted 
above the average book of its class by the really 
magical bits of description that stud its pages. 
Mr. Bullen has the gift of the seeing eye and the 
luminous word, and there is at times a touch of 
something akin to genius in his writing. But 
we wish he would eschew dialect and the melo- 
dramatic, pitfalls into which he is somewhat prone 
to stray. 

Continued interest in J. Fenimore 
er is attested by the inviting 

little biography by Mr. W. B. Shu- 
brick Clymer, in the series known as " The Beacon 
Biographies" (Small, Maynard & Co.). Of neces- 
sity considerably dependent upon Lounsbury, the 
author yet makes profitable use of hitherto unpub- 
lished letters, and clearly knows the nooks and cor- 
ners of his subject at first hand. Within the narrow 
limits of his volume he finds room for an interesting 
account of the public disputes that embittered 
Cooper's latter years, in which appear the novelist's 
fearlessness, his love of justice, and his accuracy as 
a naval historian. Cooper, it appears, was usually 
right in his main contention, and, moreover, was 
sustained by the courts. He made favorable im- 
pression upon such men as Parkman the historian, 
Morse the inventor of the telegraph, and Balzac of 
the " Come'die Humaine." His biographer shows 



1901.]

that Cooper, despite his long unpopularity with his 
countrymen, was throughout a lover of America 
and her institutions. No one will now deny his 
title as creator of at least one or two wholly original 
characters in English fiction. Mr. Clymer does not 
spare Cooper's novels of lower rank, while suffi- 
ciently praising his best. The biographer's style is 
necessarily condensed, now and then almost blunt, 
sometimes picturesque, and always clear. 



NOTES. 



" The Common Sense of Commercial Arithmetic," by 
Mr. George Hall, is published by the Macmillan Co. 

A new life of Sir Walter Scott, by Professor William 
Henry Hudson of Stanford University, is announced by 
the A. Wessels Co. 

The Laurel Press of New York will issue at an early 
date a limited edition de luxe of the " Amoretti " or 
Love Sonnets of Edmund Spenser. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. publish a new edition of 
Mrs. Fawcett's " Life of Her Majesty Queen Victoria," 
with a special introduction by Mrs. Bradley Gilman. 

"Early Days in Maple Land," by Miss Katherine A. 
Young, is a book of readings in Canadian history for 
young children. Messrs. James Pott & Co. are the 
publishers. 

" Religion in Literature and Life," by the Rev. Stop- 
ford A. Brooke, is a little book of two essays, beauti- 
fully printed at the Merrymount Press, and published 
by the Messrs. Crowell. 

Mr. Thomas Whittaker has nearly ready a new col- 
lection of sermons by Dean Farrar, entitled "True 
Religion." This will form the initial volume in a series 
of " Preachers of To-Day." 

A series of volumes descriptive of famous private 
presses is in preparation by the Kirgate Press of Can- 
ton, Pa. The first volume will be devoted to the 
Strawberry Hill Press of Horace Walpole. 

The " Modern German Literature " of Dr. Benjamin 
W. Wells has just been reissued by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. in an enlarged edition which describes 
the latest developments in the literature of the Empire. 

An " Intermediate Physiology and Hygiene," by Dr. 
Winfield S. Hall and Mrs. Jeannette Winter Hall, and 
" The New Century Primer of Hygiene," by Mrs. Hall, 
are recent elementary school publications of the Amer- 
ican Book Co. 

Mr. George Gissing's novel, " Our Friend the Char- 
latan," will be issued by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
early in the present month. The same publishers also 
announce a new novel by Mr. John Oxenham entitled 
" Our Lady of Deliverance." 

Mr. Wm. R. Jenkins is now the publisher of " The 
Complete Pocket Guide to Europe," edited by Mr. E. C. 
Stedman and Dr. Thomas L. Stedman. This useful 
book has just made its annual reappearance, revised to 
date, and as compact and serviceable as ever. 

" Some Ill-Used Words," by Mr. Alfred Ayres, is a 
useful manual by the author of " The Orthoepist " and 
" The Verbalist." The title is self-explanatory, and 
the earlier books of Mr. Ayres will commend the new 
one to popular favor. The Messrs. Appleton are the 
publishers. 



" A Little Book of Tribune Verse," by Eugene Field, 
will form the first publication of Messrs. Tandy, Wheeler 
& Co., a new firm of Denver publishers. The book 
will include practically all of the verse contributed by 
Field to the " Denver Tribune " during the two years in 
which he was associate editor of that paper. 

The " French Dramatists of the 19th Century," by 
Mr. Brander Matthews, is republished by the Messrs. 
Scribner in a third edition, with an added chapter on 
the work of the last decade of the century. This is one 
of the best of the many books that Professor Matthews 
has given us, and will be welcome in its latest form. 

Mr. Richard James Cross has made a selection of 
choice passages from the " Divina Commedia," and 
published them through Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. in 
a pretty volume with originals and English translations 
facing each other on opposite pages. The beginner in 
Dante will find this book a pleasant and serviceable 
pocket companion. 

The books of Henry Ward Beecher, hitherto pub- 
lished by Messrs. Fords, Howard & Hulbert, have re- 
cently been acquired by The Pilgrim Press, of Chicago 
and Boston. The titles include the original Plymouth 
Pulpit Sermons in five volumes, four volumes of later 
sermons, four miscellaneous works, and a life of Beecher 
by Mr. J. R. Howard. 

" Atkinson's Ganot " has been for the past quarter- 
century one of the most popular text-books of physics, 
and in its present (ninth) edition enters, we trust, upon 
a prolongation of its career of usefulness. The revision 
is by Professor H. W. Reinold, and the publishers are 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. " Natural Philosophy 
for General Readers and Young People " is the title. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. publish A French 
Grammar for Schools and Colleges," by Professors 
H. W. Fraser and J. Squair of the University of 
Toronto. The volume includes a brief French reader 
and a great supply of English exercises. The same 
publishers also send us a volume of " Exercises in 
French Syntax and Composition," by Miss Jeanne M. 
Bouvet of the Chicago High School. 

The success attending Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.'s 
edition of the French historical memoirs of Lady Jack- 
son has led the same firm to undertake a reprint in 
similar form of the English historical memoirs of John 
Heneage Jesse, covering the period from the beginning 
of the reign of James the First to the time of George 
the Third. The edition will comprise thirty volumes, 
fifteen of which will be issued this Spring. 

Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. have just published two 
volumes of much interest, intended for supplementary 
reading in schools as well as for young readers outside 
of school. " Stories of Pioneer Life for Young Read- 
ers " is by Miss Florence Bass, and " Strange Peoples " 
is by Professor Frederick Starr. A work of allied inter- 
est and usefulness is the volume of " Wigwam Stories," 
told by Miss Mary Catherine Judd, and published by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Dr. George Willis Botsford's " History of Greece " 
has proved one of the most satisfactory of recent text- 
books, and is widely used in the best high schools and 
academies. A constituency is thus ready and waiting 
for " A History of Rome " by the same author, now 
published by the Macmillan Co. The work takes the 
student down to the time of Charlemagne, thus fitting 
itself to the division of the field of general history most 
favored by educational authorities.

Lectures on the Constitution of

By EMORT 8PEER (7% x 5V 8 , pages 143 zi ). $1.25 postpaid. 

In this volume Judge SPKEK has contrived to pack much 
valuable information. All he says is interesting and well 
said. The work -is properly an introduction to a commentary 
upon the Constitution of the United States. Of this work, 
Hon. EDWARD J. PHKLPS of Yale University says : " The 
lectures are the best introduction I have ever seen to the study 
of the Constitution of the United States, and I wish they 
could be in the hands of every young man in the country whose 
thoughts are turned in that direction." Baltimore Sun.

"AS HOMELY AND PLEASING AS 'DAVID HARUMJ AND HAS THE 
SWEETNESS AND RICHNESS OF'EBEN HOLDEN.' " Baltimore American. 



RALPH MARLOWE 

By JAMES BALL NAYLOR 

A Fascinating Novel of Ohio Village Life A Book of Love and Laughter. 

The great point of excellence in this story is the marvelous way in which the author 
has given us the true atmosphere of a country town not the gawky, burlesquing, horse- 
play of the dialectic writers, but the real, homely, honest small- town air, with its lazy scent 
of apple-blossoms in the summer, and the crisp frostiness of the winter days. 



"A very substantial piece of enter- 
tainment, full of human and national 
interest, liberally streaked with pathos 
and humor and mystery, and almost 
certain to become one of the very popu- 
lar novels of the season." 

Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 



"In some important features far 
superior to ' David Harum,' . . . has a 
greater variety of interesting charac- 
ters, a much better plot, and excels 
in its dramatic situations." Trenton

"A very acceptable book it proves to 
be, with strong, distinct characters in 
the plot, and pleasing pictures of men 
and scenes as we like to see them at 
their best."

THE LOVE OF AN 
UNCROWNED QUEEN 

By W. H. WILKINS, M.A. $2.00 net. 

The romantic story of the love of Sophie Dorothea, consort 
of George /., and Count Konigsmarck. Their remarkable cor- 
respondence is now published for the first time. 

" Now that the public curiosity aroused by ' An Englishwoman's Love 
Letters' has been somewhat satiated, we should like to call attention to a 
work which is more deserving of the interest of that world that loves a 
lover. Some time ago Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. published a book 
entitled ' The Love of an Uncrowned Queen,' which for pure passion and 
genuine emotion and pathos far surpasses in human interest the fictitious 
and artificial ' letters ' said to be the work of Mr. Laurence Housman. 
Nothing could be more significant of the tyranny of caprice that elects 
one book for popularity and neglects another without any sane regard for 
their respective merits and demerits than the public excitement over ' An 
Englishwoman's Love Letters ' on the one hand and the utter lack of 
interest in ' The Love of an Uncrowned Queen ' on the other."

AUDREY 



BY MARY JOHNSTON 

AUTHOR OF "To HAVE AND To HOLD" 



Audrey is an orphan, a strange, dreamy slip of a girl, the protege 
of Marmaduke Haward, a young Virginian patrician of the early 
18th century, who entrusts her to the care of a most unclerical 
clergyman. Half child, half dryad that she is, she comes to be the 
rival of the famous beauty, Evelyn Byrd, for Haward's love. The 
story is in the nature of pure romance, and splendidly fulfills the 
artistic promise of Miss Johnston's earlier work.

DETECTIVE STORIES. 



Conan Doyle considers Poe 
the inventor of the detective 
story, and as pre-eminently the master of the short story, and adds: "The 

imaginative quality, the intellectual skill, the keen adaptation of means to ends, the subtlety 
of insight, the management of dramatic effects, are qualities upon which I delight to dwell, and 
I would emphasize my own indebtedness to Poe and my appreciation of his great abilities." 
Do you know Poe ? And do you wish an authoritative memoir which gives the true facts 
of the life of the man whom Tennyson considered the greatest American author ; one which

TWO NEW NOVELS 

"Thrilling and Realistic." 

THE WISDOM OF ESAU 

By R. L. OUTHWAITE and C. H. CHOMLEY. 12mo, pp. 345, cloth, $1.25. 

A story by two writers thoroughly at home in the atmosphere of Australian adven- 
ture and bush life, who have filled their work with the local color of the country and 
caught the character of the people as few have done. It is brimful of movement and 
action of the most thrilling and yet realistic kind. The descriptions of Australian life 
and scenery are in the highest degree picturesque, and the incident of a terrible bush fire, 
its steady advance, and the almost superhuman efforts of the hero's family and friends to 
escape from it to safety, is one of the notable passages in recent fiction. The authors have 
shown as great skill in depicting the diverse strains of human character and the play of 
human passions and emotions as they have in leading the story to a dramatic climax ; and 
they have made a book that few will be willing to lay down till it has been read through. 

"Absorbingly Interesting." 

A SOLDIER OF THE KING 

Being some Passages in the Life of Mr. John Gifford, sometime Major in the 
service of His Majesty King Charles I., and afterwards Minister of a Con- 
gregation of Christ's people at Bedford. By DORA M. JONES. 12mo, 
pp. 300, cloth, $1.25. 

The romantic story of John Gifford, the original of Bunyan's Evangelist, though 
well known to students of Bunyan's early life, has never yet been made the subject of a 
novel. Gifford was a wild Cavalier before he became a preacher, and the adventures of 
his earlier unregenerate days form the subject of " A Soldier of the King." The scene 
of the story is laid chiefly in Maidstone, and it includes the most picturesque episode in 
the history of that ancient town its capture by the Commonwealth soldiers in 1648.

Masters of French Literature 

By GEORGE M. HARPER 

" I can say with a good deal of confidence and entire sincerity that it is the best study of 
Sainte-Beuve to be found in English, and indeed I do not know where in French, in equal space, 
so much is to be learnt, and learnt with so much intellectual pleasure." (i2mo, $1.25 net.) 



"A POSITIVE REVELATION OF THE GENIUS OF ITS AUTHOR." 

The White Cottage B Y .ZACK- 

" If we were asked to name any fiction that we have read for several years past that we 
would select as a sure test of the literary intelligence and judgment of its readers, and as a 
positive revelation of the genius of its author, it would be l The White Cottage,' which places 
Miss Gwendolin Keats in the forefront of all living English women who are known to write 
fiction of any kind, if not before all her sisterhood in instinctive knowledge of and profound 
sympathy with the primitive elements of consciousness and conduct which constitute manhood 
and womanhood in their state of nature inate, individual, simple, direct, vigorous, determined, 
unchangeable, the be all and the end all of their mortal human lives. . . . Do n't take our 
word for it, or anybody's word, but give your most careful reading and your most loving under- 
standing to the power, the pathos, and the art of this remarkable, this incomparable book." 
New York Mail and Express. ($1.50.) 



"SHOWS HER IN THE FULNESS OF GREAT POWERS." 

Crucial Instances By EDITH WHARTON 

" She is to-day the most promising figure we have. To-morrow is hers. How far she 
will go it is hard to tell. But with her stern devotion to style, her worldly wisdom, her keen 
insight, her wit and her fancy, and, above all, her invariable good taste, there is no knowing 
what the future has in store." New York Evening Sun. ($1.50.) 



W. J. ROLFE, the well-known Shakespearian authority, says of 

God's Puppets A Story of Old New York 

By IMOGEN CLARK 

" Just a line to tell you how much I have enjoyed your -novel. When I found time to 
take it up I could n't lay it aside for work that I ought to be doing, and I finished it at two 
sittings. It is a masterly work, better than I anticipated, measuring your ability by what I 
had already seen of your books and magazine matter. It is far ahead of the c Little Lad,' 
admirable and charming as that was in its way. It ought to have a large sale, but nowadays it 
is n't the best novels that run up into the hundred thousands more 's the pity." ( I2mo, $1.50.)

Third Edition of a Popular Book 

Rapidly taking its place as one of the 
successes of the season. Why not 
join the discussion it has provoked? 

EVERY INCH A KING 

~ By JOSEPHINE C. SAWYER 

THE NEW YORK TIMES says : 

" This love story, through which the leading characters tread with such rare grace, is a 
sweet and pleasing one, happily lacking in all those scenes of bloodshed and violence which have 
so often filled the pages of modern fiction. The historical background of the story is well 
maintained also, and the whole book seems written with a loving interest and care which adds 
much to the sincerity of the author's purpose. 

" There is a grace of style about it, too. The stately diction of the fifteenth century is 
well maintained, and each sentence is rounded and finished in a charmingly musical manner. 
One cannot speak too highly of the purity of the tale, which should gain for the book a wide- 
spread interest apart from any historical merit it may possess." 

Here one moves in the society 
of the old nobility. 

The nobility of the Beauforts, the Mortimers, the Straffords, 
so completely destroyed by the " Wars of the Roses." 

Here is a strife between good and evil, 
with " love " as victor. 

But it is not chiefly a story of duels and hairbreadth escapes, 
but a good love, hate, and victory story.

JUST READY. 

The Wit and Wisdom of Jesus. 

By GEORGE WRIGHT BUCKLEY, author of " Carlyle and 
Emerson : a Contrast," " Politics and Morals," etc. 
Cloth, gilt top, 213 pages, Sl.OO. 

The fresh and vivid portraiture of Jeans presented in these 
strong and attractively written pages makes us at once, as it 
were, the personal friend of the author, and more than ever 
the friend of the great friend of man whose wit and wisdom 
the volume recounts. The work is not an arid technical study : 
it is the expression of a warm and loyal appreciation. To quote 
from the Introductory chapter : " What concerns the author 
is not that he classify the wit and wisdom of Jesus under defi- 
nite categories ; but rather that he give them some living 
relation to the sublime personality whence they sprang, and 
that, too, with a religious and moral motive." 

Health and a Day. 

By Dr. LEWIS G. JANES, M. A., author of " Life as a Fine 
Art," "Evolution of Morals," "Social Ideals and Social 
Progress," etc. Cloth, gilt top, 185 pages, Sl.OO. 
The Outlook has just said : " This little book is a tonic for 
both sick and well. One can scarcely pick out a single chap- 
ter the reading of which will not prove bracing and helpful. 
There is no spirit of controversy or of faddism in the sugges- 
tions as to health : they are pervaded by a gentle spirit that 
easily wins the reader to confidence in their reasonableness. 
The book aims, however, at a wider outlook than that which 
is usually connoted by the word health, and touches on many 
themes which go to the filling out of a normal and useful life."

A GREAT WORK NEARING COMPLETION 



Cyclopaedia of American 
Horticulture 

Edited by L. H. BAILEY, Assisted by WILHELM MULLER 
and many expert Cultivators and Botanists. 

Volumes I., IL, and III. are now ready, and Volume IV., completing the 
work, is in press and will be published soon. 



In this great Cyclopedia will be found a complete description of all 
species of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants in America. 
Directions for the cultivation of all kinds of crops, observations on 

marketing, etc. 

OPINIONS OF THE WORK 

" We do not hesitate to commend this work to our readers, whether fruit-growers, gardeners, gentle- 
men of leisure, or of whatever profession, for it contains such information as it will take scores of books 
to give, and cannot fail to both interest and instruct every reader." Canadian Horticulturist. 

" The information is precisely what the horticulturist and general reader is desirous of knowing." 

Scientific American. 

" In range, treatment, and editing emphatically useful worthy of ranking by the side of the Century 
Dictionary." The Nation. 

" As showing the earnest endeavor to be quite up to date, the very complete note on Horticulture in 
the Hawaiian Islands may be cited; half a page and over is devoted to this item. Grapes, American and 
European, grafting, the history and principle of greenhouse construction, and the various fruits, are all 
ably treated." American Gardening. 

" It is a work for the gardener to gloat over, for the student of horticulture to pore over, and for one 
who is neither of these to delight in possessing." Chicago Tribune. 

" While the entire work will cost twenty dollars, it will be money well spent by any owner of an 
orchard or even a gardener. It will be to the farmer what the Century Dictionary is to the literary 
man." San Francisco Chronicle.

TENDENCIES IN LITERATURE. 

To the seasoned critic, there are few things 
so amusing as the habit the amateur observer 
has of indulging in broad generalizations con- 
cerning contemporary literature. Some book 
proves to be the fashion of the hour, and 
straightway it is made the subject of philoso- 
phizing. What is merely a ripple upon the 
surface of popular taste is viewed as a fresh 
and deep current of human thought, and this 
supposedly new departure of the spirit serves 
as a starting-point for many a solemn disquisi- 
tion upon types and schools and movements. 
These grave inductions from a single instance, 
or a few instances, however philosophical the 
parade of the terms in which they are presented, 
betray their essentially unphilosophical char- 
acter by the obvious inadequacy of their basis 
of fact. They are made only to be forgotten, 
as, in the majority of cases, the books that 
occasioned them are forgotten, after the lapse 
of a few years. It is not so very long ago that 
the American public was reading and talking 
"Trilby," with such frantic enthusiasm that 
one would have thought a new literary era had 
dawned. Many were the seeming-wise reflect- 
ions of which this entertaining story was the 
innocent provoking cause, many were the hopes, 
or the fears, for our literary development that 
took their starting point from the vogue of this 
particular piece of fiction. All this discussion 
was the work of the amateur, and we now 
realize how absurd it all was. The novel in 
question is clean forgotten to-day, and with it 
the whole argument based upon its success. 
Anyone can see now what the practised critic 
saw all the time, that there was no more 
significance in the astonishing vogue of " Tril- 
by " than there had been a score of years 
earlier in the equally astonishing vogue of 
"Helen's Babies." 

In point of fact, when the philosophical 
student of literature confronts the question of 
literary tendencies, he sees two things with ab- 
solute distinctness. One of them is that the 
study of tendencies, of movements, of the 
transformations of a nation's idealisms, is the 



326 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



most important thing about the history of any 
literature, the only thing, indeed, that invests 
a literature with real significance for the his- 
tory of culture. If he cannot discern the evo- 
lutionary process at work, he misses all the 
salt and savor of his subject, and his conclu- 
sions are empirical or merely subjective. The 
other thing is that this process of development, 
this history of movements and transformations, 
requires for its proper observation a consider- 
able period to be taken into survey, and a con- 
siderable detachment, in point of time, from 
that period. The one well-nigh impossible task 
is to trace the direction of the evolutionary 
process in one's immediate surroundings, or to 
make any prophecies for the future save those 
that are the logical outcome of some tendency 
that has been in operation long enough to be- 
come clearly discerned. 

Suppose one were to take some representa- 
tive collection of contemporary literature, such, 
for example, as the closing section of either of 
Mr. Stedman's great anthologies, and read it 
through intent only upon the detection of tend- 
encies, or of unifying principles, he would find 
it an extremely difficult matter to reduce to 
order his confused and varied impressions. In 
such a case, it is impossible to see the woods 
for the trees. To discern the tendencies at 
work in such a mass of literary production, to 
find the pattern in so complex a web of intel- 
lectual activity, to distinguish the currents 
from the eddies in so wide an expanse of waters, 
would be a task well worth attempting, indeed, 
but one likely to baffle the most persistent ef- 
fort. Of course the problem might to a certain 
extent be simplified by discarding the great 
mass of the work as merely reflecting the hues 
caught from the greater poems, as merely echo- 
ing the significant ideas of the age put forth 
by the few writers who set the pitch for the 
symphony. The lesser writers contribute to 
the harmony (or the discord) and the tone- 
coloring of the composition, but they do not 
modify the fundamental character of the move- 
ment. Nevertheless, the difficulty is not really 
removed by this process of elimination ; it is 
somewhat lessened, and that is all. 

A few generalizations, however, concerning 
the tendencies and characteristics of our con- 
temporary English literature it seems reason- 
ably safe to make, and one of them is that we 
are living in a critical rather than a creative 
period. As the few great survivors of the 
earlier age one by one pass away, we feel 
acutely conscious that the places are left un- 



filled. The season of analysis and introspec- 
tion is clearly upon us. In such a period as 
ours, versatility, good taste, and excellence of 
workmanship, and the number of good writers, 
as distinguished from the great masters, is as- 
tonishingly large. Sometimes they spring up 
in the most unexpected quarters, and anticipa- 
tion flutters at the thought of a possible resurg- 
ence of the creative impulse. But we must 
not deceive ourselves into thinking that our 
bustling literary activity is swelling to any 
appreciable or noticeable extent the stock of 
the world's masterpieces. Our literature of 
to-day is various and entertaining, it has 
taste and even distinction, but it is not a 
literature adorned by the opulent blossoming 
of genius. 

If we may venture, after the preceding dis- 
claimer, to indicate any distinct tendencies in 
the English and American literature of the 
past few years, we would say that it has moved, 
and is still moving, in the direction of artistic 
freedom, of cosmopolitan interest, and of broad- 
ened social sympathy. It no longer suffers, 
for example, under the reproach of being pro- 
duced with an exaggerated deference to the 
Young Person. To place under the ban whole 
tracts of human life, to refrain from dealing 
with whole groups of the most important of 
human relations because their treatment gives 
offence to immature minds, is a procedure not 
justified by the larger view of what literature 
means. This lesson we have learned of recent 
years. If we take into account the newest of 
new women and the youngest of emancipated 
young men, it may seem that the lesson has 
been too well learned, but, on the whole, our 
literary art has gained strength with its newly 
acquired freedom. Our literature is also meas- 
urably freed from its old time provincialism of 
outlook. We have seen established for the 
mintage of the mind a broader compact than 
any Latin Union ; if an idea have but intrinsic 
value, its currency does not now need to be 
forced in other countries than that of its origin. 
This, too, is a great gain, and will make the 
next creative period all the easier of approach. 
But the greatest gain of all, to our thinking, 
is the awakening of the new social sympathy 
that characterizes our recent literature. We 
hear a good deal of " democratic art," and 
much of what we have thus far got is distress- 
ingly crude and dull with didacticism. But the 
future of our race belongs to democracy, and 
literature must make the best of this inevitable 
movement. That it will eventually learn how 



1901.] 



THE DIAL 



327 



to shape the idealism of democracy into forms 
of convincing beauty we make no doubt, and 
the signs are not wanting that such an issue is 
near at hand. We might make specific men- 
tion, to support this proposition, of the remark- 
able recent work of one of our younger poets, 
but since we propose to consider that at 
some length in the next issue of THE DIAL,, 
the hint shall suffice us here. An illustration 
of more resounding significance may be found 
in the work of the greatest of living Russians. 
The writings of Count Tolstoy, or to be more 
exact, the earnest attention which they have 
received during the past few years, offer im- 
pressive example of the power of the social 
motive as embodied in the forms of fictive art, 
to make itself felt as a force in literature. 
Here is a writer whose whole genius is spent 
in an impassioned appeal to purely democratic 
sympathies, and, as the years go on, his figure 
assumes grander and grander proportions, and 
his utterance seems to become more and more 
invested with the attributes of prophecy. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



OUR LITERARY FOLK-LORE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The readers of THE DIAL, or at least part of them, 
are interested no doubt in what may be called literary 
folk-lore. If so, I trust that some of them will be will- 
ing to assist in the collection of a very interesting body 
of such folk-lore now swiftly passing out of existence. 
That constituency of THE DIAL which had the good 
fortune to be raised in the country will doubtless re- 
member the way in which the young people of their 
neighborhood used to get around the sensitive con- 
sciences of Presbyterian elders and Methodist class- 
leaders, by calling their dances by the innocent name 
of "singing games." When they wanted to dance at 
their parties they asked permission to " play games," 
and then they would dance to the choral singing of 
" Lead her up and down to your best liking," " Weevilly 
Wheat," and "Pop Goes the Weasel." Both words 
and music of these choral dance songs were in every 
case traditional. Some of them, like the singing games 
of children, were evidently the broken-down remains of 
old folk-ballads. A recent attempt to secure some of 
them shows that in fifteen years they have disappeared 
completely from one neighborhood, but there must be 
communities where they are still played or at least may 
be collected from the memories of those who played 
them in their youth. It is to be hoped, therefore, that 
this nineteenth century survival of old folk-poetry will 
receive the attention it deserves while there is yet time. 
Personally, I shall be grateful for any help to save the 
old songs. GEOKGE MOREY MILLER.

VARIATIONS IN TENNYSON. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I was much interested in Professor Albert . Jack's 
notice of Mr. J. Churton Collins's "Early Poems of 
Tennyson," in a recent issue of THE DIAL. As he re- 
marks, Mr. Collins is wrong in assuming that his is the 
first attempt to record the various readings of these and 
other poems of Tennyson; nor was the work that I did 
in the " Cambridge " Tennyson, to which Professor 
Jack refers, the first of the kind. 

As long ago as 1857, when I was reading " The 
Princess " with a high-school class, I happened to notice 
that variations occurred in different editions of the 
poem; and I copied all these into the edition I was 
using. Later I found and recorded variations in other 
poems that we read in school. In 1883 I published an 
annotated edition of " The Princess," in which I gave 
all the various readings, so far as I could ascertain 
them. For the first edition of the poem I had to depend 
on the American reprint, which I collated with the sec- 
ond London edition and the fourth and fifth American 
editions. I could not get hold of the third edition 
(1850) in which the intercalary songs first appeared, 
but the copy of the second edition that I used had these 
songs inserted in manuscript. 

For the third issue of my edition (1890), I had the 
privilege of examining an interleaved copy of the first 
English edition of " The Princess " belonging to my 
friend Dr. F. J. Furnivall of London, in which he had 
recorded the new readings of the third and fifth edi- 
tions. This enabled me to settle some doubtful points 
and to supply several omissions in my collation of those 
editions; and also to detect sundry curious misprints in 
the first American edition and a few errors in the 
manuscript copy of the songs mentioned above. I had 
also received a very kind letter from Lord Tennyson, 
calling attention to one or two slips in notes quoted 
from Mr. Dawson's " Study of The Princess.' " 

In 1884 I edited " Select Poems of Tennyson," in- 
cluding many of those given by Mr. Collins, and noted 
all the variations from the English edition of 1884 
which I found in the American reprints from 1849 
down. For the readings of the editions of 1830, 1832, 
and 1842, I had to depend mainly on quotations in the 
reviews and in the commentaries of Shepherd, Tainsh, 
Wace, Bayne, and others. For the first edition of the 
Wellington Ode, I used a copy given to the Harvard 
Library by the poet Longfellow. 

In 1 887, 1 edited " Enoch Arden and Other Poems " 
on the same plan; and for this and the second edition 
of the "Select Poems" (1886) I had the opportunity 
of making a rather hurried examination of the 1830 
and 1832 editions in the British Museum, which was 
supplemented by some work of the kind done for me 
by a person recommended by the Museum authorities, 
but in which I subsequently found many errors. 

Revised editions of these two books, with additional 
poems, were published in 1895; and for these editions 
I was able to consult a good number of the English 
editions. 

In 1895 I also published an edition of " In Memo- 
riam," much of the work on which had been done dur- 
ing the ten years previous. For the various readings I 
had the benefit of a copy of the first English edition 
given me by Dr. Furnivall, in which he had recorded 
most of them. 

In 1896 I edited the " Idylls of the King," using most 



328 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



of the earlier English and American editions in the col- 
lation of the text. I also corrected the irregular and 
often inconsistent pointing, capitalization, etc., of the 
English editions, and in an appendix filled nearly two 
pages of fine print with specimens of these errors and 
incongruities. 

In 1895-1897 I edited the complete de luxe edition 
of Tennyson brought out by Messrs. Estes & Lauriat 
in twelve volumes, with variorum and other notes; and 
in 1898 the " Cambridge " edition, in which the various 
readings were given more concisely. 

I have spent perhaps half a dozen hours in examining 
Mr. Collins's book, and have already noted many errors 
and omissions. Most of these, like those to which Pro- 
fessor Jack refers, are " very slight," but not a few of 
them are much worse than the general character of the 
work would have led me to expect. Some of them in- 
dicate apparent carelessness in collation, and others in 
proofreading. 

On p. 53, for instance, two entire lines of a stanza of 
"Mariana in the South," as printed in 1833 (1832), 
are omitted: 

" Backward the latticeblind she flung, 
And leaned upon the balcony." 

I give them as they appear in my " Enoch Arden, etc.," 
(1895). 

On p. 66, the 1833 version of a line of the first song 
in "The Miller's Daughter" ("And I would lie so 
light, so light ") is given simply " So warm and light." 
It should be (if my edition is right) " I would lie round 
so warm and light." This, by the way, is a specimen 
of a class of errors giving an early reading only in 
part. The use of the capital in "So" is misleading; 
but in all such cases Mr. Collins begins his quotations 
with a capital. Even the article a when given alone 
in a note (as in that on " Like one great garden glowed," 
p. 26, where the 1830 reading is " a great garden "), 
is printed thus: "1830. A." 

On p. 68, the fact that two stanzas of " The Miller's 
Daughter " were added in 1842 (the two preceding the 
last one, as the poem now stands) is not mentioned. 
Mrs. Kemble, in the " Democratic Review " for Janu- 
ary, 1844 (Vol. xiv. p. 62 fol.), is very severe in her 
comments upon this addition to the 1832 form of the 
poem. I quote the passage (nearly a page of it) in 
my " Select Poems," p. 200. 

On p. 95, the three stanzas of the " Palace of Art " 
which Tennyson gives in a foot-note of 1832 as omitted 
from the poem because it is " already too long," are 
cited ; but Mr. Collins is apparently not aware that the 
poet corrected the astronomical allusions in them when 
they were printed in Palgrave's " Lyrical Poems of 
Tennyson," 1885. The original reading in the third 
stanza was: 

"She saw the snowy poles of moonless Mars, 

That marvellous round of milky light 
Below Orion, and those double stars," etc. 

In Palgrave's book it is given (according to my " Select 
Poems," p. 218) thus, without even a hint that it had 
been changed since 1832 : 

"She saw the snowy poles and moons of Mars, 

That marvellous field of drifted light 
In mid Orion, and the married stars," etc. 
No critic, so far as I am aware, has noticed this varia- 
tion. Tennyson from his early years was intensely in- 
terested in astronomy, and is remarkably accurate in 
his frequent allusions to it. The moons of Mars were 
not discovered until long after this stanza was first 



written; but it is curious that he should have put the 
famous nebula of Orion " below " the constellation. 
Probably, however, he was thinking at the moment of 
the belt of the giant. 

This omission in Mr. Collins's notes reminds me of 
another which is more surprising, for even if he never 
happened to see Palgrave's book, he must be familiar 
with " The Foresters." On p. 295 he gives the " Nat- 
ional Song," printed in 1830 but afterwards suppressed 
for sixty-two years or until 1892, when it was inserted 
in " The Foresters," with no change except in the 
chorus of the two stanzas, which read thus in 1830: 

'' CHORUS. For the French the Pope may shrive 'em, 
For the devil a whit we heed 'em : 
As for the French, God speed 'em 

Unto their heart's desire, 
And the merry devil drive 'em 
Through the water and the fire. 

" FULL CHORUS. Our glory is our freedom, 
We lord it o'er the sea ; 
We are the sons of freedom, 
We are free." 

I quote from the de luxe Tennyson, Vol. xi. p. 298. 
For the chorus as it now stands the reader can refer 
to " The Foresters." Mr. Collins notes neither the 
insertion of the song in the play nor the change in the 
chorus. 

In " The Talking Oak," Tennyson made only two 
changes after its first publication in 1842. Shepherd 
(" Tennysoniana," 2d ed , 1879) says there was only 
one, and Collins gives only one. It is amazing that he 
should have overlooked the second (line 215): "The 
murmurs of the drum and fife " for " The whispers of 
the drum and fife." It is given in my " Select Poems " 
(p. 232). I think that nobody else has called attention 
to it. I first detected it in 1884 in the American 
edition of 1842. As I bad not seen the English edition 
of 1842, it occurred to me when I did not find it in 
Collins's book that it might be only in the American 
edition, which was printed from advance sheets of the 
English; but Professor Jack informs me that it is in 
the latter. I could hardly believe that two collators 
overlooked it, but it seems that they did. 

The reader may be surprised that I should suspect a 
variation of this kind in an American edition printed 
from advance sheets; but I had previously detected a 
curious one (unknown to all the critics) in the " Idylls 
of the King." In "Merlin and Vivien" (entitled 
simply "Vivien" at first), the American edition of 
1859 reads (lines 148 fol.): 
" She loathed the knights and ever seem'd to hear 

Their laughing comment when her name was named. 

For once, when Arthur walking all alone, 

Vexed at a rumor rife about the Queen, 

Had met her," etc. 

This reading is found nowhere else. The poet must 
have altered the passage before the English edition of 
1859 was printed, but after the advance sheets had 
been dispatched to this country. The reading in 1857, 
when " six trial-copies " of " Enid " and " Vivien " were 
printed (of which the copy in the British Museum is 
believed to be the sole survivor), was this: 
" She hated all the knights because she deem'd 
They wink'd and jested when her name was named." 

The present reading is: 

"She hated all the knights, and heard in thought 
Their lavish comment when her name was named.

I have given only a few specimens of the more serious 
of Mr. Collins's errors and omissions. I have found 
many others in the hasty examination I have made of 
perhaps a fifth part of the book. 

Misprints are not uncommon: as " Confutzer " for 
" Confutzee " in a suppressed stanza of " The Palace 
of Art" (p. 93); "books" for "book" in an 1832 
reading of a line in " The Miller's Daughter " (p. 63) 
"The letters of the books she reads" unless my 
note in the " Select Poems " (p. 198) is wrong, which 
I do not believe; the misplacing of a reference to a 
foot-note on p. 100, which makes the 1832 reading of 
" Where I may mourn and pray " to be " Dying the 
death I die " (which should refer to " And save me 
lest I die " in the proceeding stanza), etc. 

I agree fully with Professor Jack in regard to the 
foolishness of noting insignificant variations in spelling, 
like though and tho\ gray and grey, etc. While giving 
these quite uniformly, Mr. Collins is very irregular 
in regard to Tennyson's whimsical omission of the 
hyphen in hundreds of compound words. Thus we 
find " silkensailed," " pearlgarland, " " darklatticed," 
" sharpshadowed," " chestnutboughs," etc. Mr. Collins 
prints many of these as Tennyson does; others he 
prints with the hyphen; others as two separate words; 
and all three forms he often has in the same poem, and 
sometimes on the same page. In my editions I follow 
Tennyson's eccentric method in all cases; but I should 
not quarrel with anybody who chose to conform to or- 
dinary usage instead, if he would do it uniformly. 

Mr. Collins is also irregular in regard to the punc- 
tuation of his quotations from the early editions; but 
some of the variations (periods in place of commas and 
the like, which confuse or pervert the sense of the 
passage) are probably the fault of the proofreader. 

With all its defects the book is a valuable one. The 
labor involved in preparing it can hardly be appreciated 
except by the few who have tried their own hands at 
similar tasks. In the case of Tennyson, who probably 
" tinkered " his poems more than any other English or 
American author, it is not likely that we shall ever 
have a perfectly complete and accurate variorum edition. 
He never brought out a new edition without some 
changes in the text perhaps a single little word in a 
line that had been unaltered for forty years or more, 
and one must carefully scrutinize every line and every 
word in each of many editions in order to detect these 
occasional trivial changes; and after all he may over- 
look some of them, as I find from Mr. Collins's book 
that I have done in two or three instances in poems 
that I have collated again and again. I have sometimes 
come very near making other mistakes. To give a 
single instance, Tennyson made no change in "The 
Poet's Song," published in 1842, until forty-seven years 
later (1889), when he put "fly" instead of "bee" in 
the line " The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee." I 
had printed it in 1886 in a little book that I have not 
mentioned above ("The Young People's Tennyson "), 
and it was by the merest chance that, in adding it to the 
enlarged " Select Poems " in 1895, 1 happened to refer 
to an English edition of that year and caught that 
" fly." If I had not known the poem by heart I might 
have missed the insect even then. -^yr j

THE IRON CHANCELLOR IN A NEW LIGHT.* 

It is complained that if publishers go on 
feeding the current popular craving for sweets 
in the form of love-letters it will end in the 
public's losing its taste for plain food altogether, 
and having its digestion permanently spoiled. 
There may be something in this, but the danger 
seems overdrawn. Reading, say, Victor Hugo's 
love-letters through at a sitting would certainly 
be like eating one's way unassisted through a 
whole box of caramels the results might be 
unpleasant. But it is not so of the Love Let- 
ters of Bismarck, which we have now before 
us in a comely volume of 430 pages. These 
quite German examples of the billet-doux are 
sensible, practical, " newsy," only moderately 
saccharine. They are indited to Fraiilein von 
Puttkamer a name not savoring particularly 
of sentiment. We do not mean that the letters 
are not affectionate, that they contain no tender 
passages, no terms of endearment. The Chan- 
cellor " makes love " throughout the earlier 
epistles at least, if in a rather rough, Junkerish, 
half- cynical way. Once, in a burst of unusual 
tenderness, he calls Frl. von Puttkamer " a 
little pink angel," but as he soon goes on to 
talk of a package of sausages and some socks 
she has sent him, the reader's nerves are re- 
lieved. In fine, if the affection breathed from 
the letters is not of the ecstatic order, it is at 
all events a manifestly strong and durable 
fabric, made in Germany, and warranted to 
wear. 

The letters extend from the time (1846) of 
the writer's engagement to Frl. von Puttkamer, 
to 1889 ; and about a third of them were writ- 
ten before the marriage took place. A few 
extracts will serve to show their general drift 
and quality. A letter of 1850 indicates the 
writer's opinion of the liberal movement of the 
time. Speaking of the possibility of a clash 
between Prussia and Austria, Bismarck goes 
on to say : 

" Robert Blum's bust, draped with black and white 
sashes and cockades, is the emblem by which members 
of the Berlin militia, and democrats of all countries 
here, at Frankfort, and elsewhere, celebrate their fes- 
tivities and swear vengeance on monarchs; to this has 
Prussia grown. It is for these people we shall be

victorious, if we are victorious; and every democrat 
will exhibit his wounds to the King as an unpaid bill, 
when, with his help, we have conquered. I cannot 
restrain my tears when I reflect what has become of 
my pride, my joy, my fatherland, the faithful, brave, 
honest Prussian nation, intoxicated by the giddy cup 
which they call Prussian honor, in the leading-strings 
of a gang of Rhenish place-hunters and scoffing 
democrats." 

The following sketch (1851) of Amschel 
Rothschild shows that the Chancellor was no 
poor hand at a portrait : 

"... I have picked the enclosed leaves for you in 
the garden of old Amschel Rothschild, whom I like, 
because he is simply a haggling Jew, and does not pre- 
tend to be anything else, and, at the same time, a 
strictly orthodox Jew, who touches nothing at his din- 
ners, and eats only ' undefiled ' food. ' Johann, dage 
vid you some bread for de deers,' he said to his servant 
as he came out to show me his garden, in which there 
were some tame fallow deer. ' Baron, dat blant costs 
me two thousand guilders, honor bride, two thousand 
guilders cash; I vill let you have it for one thousand, 
or, if you vant it for nuddings, he shall bring id to your 
house. God knows I abbrejiate you highly, Baron; 
you are a nize man, a brave man.' With that he is a 
little, thin, gray imp of a man, the patriarch of his 
tribe, but a poor man in his palace, childless, a widower, 
cheated by his servants, and ill-treated by aristocratic- 
ally Frenchified and Anglicized nephews and nieces, 
who will inherit his treasures without gratitude and 
without love." 

In 1852 Bismarck fought his famous duel 
with Vincke, and his account of the affair does 
not greatly heighten one's esteem for his char- 
acter. 

"Vincke wished to defer the matter for forty-eight 
hours, which I granted. On the 25th, at 8 A. M., we 
rode to Tegel; to a charming spot in the woods by the 
seashore; it was beautiful weather, and the birds sang 
so gayly in the sunshine that, as we entered the wood, 
all sad thoughts left me; only the thought of Johanna 
I had to drive from me by force, so as not to be affected 
by it. With me as witnesses were Arnim and Eberhard 
Stolberg, and my brother as a very dejected spectator. 
With V. was Sauken, and Major Vincke of the First 
Chamber, as well as a Bodelschwingh as impartial wit- 
ness. The latter declared before the matter began that 
the challenge seemed to him to be, under the circum- 
stances, too stringent, and proposed that it should be 
modified to one shot apiece (four had been agreed upon). 
Sauken, in V.'s name, was agreeable to this, and had 
word brought to me that the whole thing should be 
called off if I declared I was sorry for my remark. As 
I could not truthfully do this, we took our positions, 
fired at Bodelschwingh's command, and both missed. 
God forgive the grave sin that I did not at once recog- 
nize His mercy, but I cannot deny it: when I looked 
through the smoke and saw my adversary standing 
erect, a feeling of disappointment prevented me from 
participating in the general rejoicing, which caused 
Bodelschwingh to shed tears; the modification of the 
challenge annoyed me, and I would gladly have con- 
tinued the combat. But as I was not the insulted party, 



I could say nothing; it was all over, and all shook 
hands." 

The following passage from a letter of 
1847 will answer better than the foregoing 
extracts to show the Chancellor in the guise 
of a lover : 

" Why do you so lament your last letter? I found 
nothing in it that was not dear to me, or could have 
been dearer. And, were it otherwise, where should you 
in future find a heart on which to disburden your own 
of that which oppresses it, if not with me? . . . My 
dear, dear Johanna, must I tell you once more that I 
love you; sons phrase, that we ought to share with each 
other joy and suffering, I your suffering and you 
mine; that we are not united for the sake of showing and 
sharing with each other only that which gives pleasure; 
but that you may pour out your heart at all times to 
me and I to you, whatever it may contain; that I must 
and will bear your sorrows, your thoughts, your naughti- 
nesses, if you have any, and love you as you are not as 
you ought to be or might be? . . . Do not keep your 
gloomy thoughts for yourself while you look on me with 
cheerful brow and merry eyes, but share with me in word 
and look what you have in your heart, whether it be 
blessing or sorrow. . . . Look upon us as mutual father- 
confessors; as more than that, since we, according to 
the Scripture, are to be ' one flesh.' " 

The letters contained in this volume are, in 
point of fact, for the most part letters written 
by Bismarck to his wife. To entitle them,, 
therefore, collectively " Love Letters " is not 
wholly accurate, although perhaps a third of 
them belong fairly in that category. They are 
certainly better worth reading than if they all 
harped constantly on the same tender string. 
They are various in tone and matter. They 
bring us very near sometimes to the Chancel- 
lor's secret opinions on topics whereon he was 
accustomed to be reticent. For the most part 
they show Bismarck in an unusually amiable 
light. He is the affectionate, domestic, prac- 
tical-minded, confidential lover and husband 
throughout. W.e see how thoroughly whole- 
some and pleasant his home relations must 
have been ; how, amid the distractions, respon- 
sibilities, triumphs of his public career, it wa& 
about his own hearthstone that his affections 
and deepest interests really centred. The 
biographical value of the letters is consider- 
able, and they certainly tend to soften the 
rugged lines of the usually accepted portrait 
of the Iron Chancellor. Clearly, the man of 
blood and iron, the cynical statesman who de- 
clared that the moral law had no bearing on 
politics, was a lovable man in the home circle. 
The volume is handsomely got up, and contains 
some interesting portraits after unfamiliar orig- 
inals. E. G. J

THORPE'S CONSTITUTIONAL, HISTORY.* 



Professor Thorpe's "The Constitutional 
History of the United States " is a record of 
the rise and progress of the American consti- 
tution, from a new point of view. While this 
work differs from all those on the subject which 
have preceded it, it does not aim to displace 
any of them, but constitutes a distinct addition 
to the group. Though the author extends his 
observations over the entire period of our nat- 
ional history down to 1895, he is less discursive 
than Von Hoist, whose work included an elab- 
orate presentation of our political affairs, such 
as are generally considered not a part of our 
constitutional history. Mr. Thorpe aims to 
elaborate such political movements only as 
were fundamental in their bearing. His treat- 
ment of his subject somewhat resembles that 
of Curtis, but he covers a longer period, thus 
requiring more pages. The three volumes of 
his work are not unduly expanded. Indeed, 
in view of one consideration noted below, the 
treatise might well have been made larger. 

The present work serves either as a supple- 
ment, or as a companion treatise, to Mr. 
Thorpe's earlier " Constitutional History of 
the American People." That work was intended 
as an exposition of the State side, and the 
present one as an exposition of the National 
side, of our dual system of government. Ref- 
erences are here frequently made to passages 
or chapters in the former treatise. Those who 
possess both works, or who find them together 
in the same library, can utilize them jointly by 
means of these references. But the two parts 
of our dual system are so far one, as the author's 
present references to his earlier volumes indi- 
cate, that his readers could have no ground of 
objection to the size of the new treatise if it 
had been expanded to five volumes, by em- 
bodying in 1 it all the matter which was included 
in his first " Constitutional History." The 
two elements of this dual system may well be 
considered together as parts of one whole ; and 
there are certain advantages to be gained by 
this mode of studying them which are not se- 
cured when these elements are examined separ- 
ately. As Mr. Thorpe said in his earlier work : 
" Originally as well as lawfully, the common- 
wealth constitutions are a part of the national." 

The plan of construction adopted for this 
treatise by Mr. Thorpe is advantageous, and is

well adapted for the presentation of those de- 
tails which he has assumed to be of prime 
importance. To treat with fidelity all the 
minutiae of so vast a general theme, or to give 
even slight attention to every detail for which 
any one of a thousand readers might perhaps 
be expected to make a demand, would be ob- 
viously impracticable. Some limits must be 
set to the size of the work, and only those de- 
tails which are of more general interest can be 
allowed discussion in the text. A happy com- 
promise between vague generalization and in- 
terminable minuteness has been adopted. The 
period of time from 1765 to 1895 has been 
divided into six epochs, of varying length, to 
each of which is devoted a section of the 
treatise, called a " Book." The transition of 
thirteen detached colonies into one national 
State, during the years from 1765 to 1787, is 
presented in Book I., under the title of " The 
New Nation." Book II., devoted to "The 
Formation of the National Constitution," re- 
lates the preparations for and the drafting and 
submission of that instrument. Its reception 
by the people, and their adoption of it with its 
early amendments, including the twelfth in 
1804, occupy the space allotted to Book III., 
with the heading, " The Constitution before 
the People." Then follows the period of " Con- 
test and Compromise," from 1804 to 1861, in 
Book IV., wherein is traced the path of con- 
troversy over the compromises of the Consti- 
tution concerning slavery, down to the time 
when swords took up the quarrel. Book V. 
presents the four years of the Civil War, under 
the name of " Emancipation," the word which 
sums up the great change effected by that war 
in our governmental system. " The Extension 
of the Suffrage " is the theme of Book VI., 
describing the next great change in that system, 
which was adopted as a logical development 
from the immediate results of the war. Thus 
is attained an easy analysis, into periods of 
varying duration, of our entire constitutional 
progress as a Nation, down to the advent of 
the present entirely new era. 

The mode of treatment chosen by Mr. 
Thorpe, for the presentation of the constitu- 
tional features of each of these epochs, is to 
illustrate them by drawing largely upon the 
current debates and discussions, and expres- 
sions of individual and aggregate opinion, in 
legislatures, conventions, and other public as- 
semblies. The controversies of the time, repro- 
duced in condensed form, speak for themselves, 
in the arguments advanced, the clashing of

contrary views, the statutes or resolutions 
adopted, and the constitutional amendments 
presented and considered. Those who have 
read with pleasure the pages of Mr. Thorpe's 
earlier work will find here the same vivid and 
picturesque presentation of the living issues of 
each of these epochs in our history. It is most 
interesting reading to trace, in practically the 
language of the time itself, the course of de- 
bate, not only upon the framing by the conven- 
tion and the discussion by the people of the 
original Constitution, but also upon the consid- 
eration of the early amendments ; of the com- 
promise legislation, prior to the Civil War, 
respecting slavery ; of the unsuccessful move- 
ments toward further compromises ; and finally, 
of the successive post-bellum amendments, each 
advancing to a constitutional outpost not pre- 
viously occupied. The movement of an epoch, 
a century old, is thus brought before us with 
the freshness of the present time, and the vital 
interests of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- 
turies, in questions fundamental to our system 
of government, become vital to us to-day. 

One agreeable instance of Mr. Thorpe's 
method is in his paraphrase of the President's 
arguments for nationality in 1861. Lincoln 
stepped into his office with an authoritative and 
categorical statement of the constitutional rights 
and powers of the central government, and the 
utter unconstitutionality of secession, which 
were to be the basis upon which his adminis- 
tration would wage a defensive war for the 
preservation of the Union as its prime object. 
Mr. Thorpe wisely adopts the ideas advanced 
by Lincoln, in this and his later state papers, 
and the language in which they were presented, 
as the best exposition in our literature of the 
nationality which underlies our Constitution. 
His argument was clear and vigorous, befitting 
his high theme ; and his presentation of the 
national idea was then, and still remains, un- 
answerable. 

Graphic is our author's picture of the insti- 
tution of slavery entrenched in the compromises 
of the Constitution, the inertness of the national 
government, and the general torpidity of the 
public mind on the subject, as indicated in the 
projected thirteenth amendment of 1861 which 
was to perpetuate the institution. Graphic, 
too, is his representation of the change of pub- 
lic sentiment, even in the border States, and 
the movement toward State constitutions de- 
claring against slavery, when the progress of 
the war had proven the institution effete, and 
the adoption by the States of the doctrine of 



the paramount allegiance of citizens to the 
National government. 

It is refreshing to observe that Mr. Thorpe 
finds no warrant, in the facts of our history, 
for the theory of the rightfulness of secession. 
The Declaration of Independence was a joint, 
not a several act. " In practical politics it 
announced the birth of a new nation." Months 
before, Congress had advised the people that 
" it would be very dangerous to the liberties and 
welfare of America for any colony separately 
to petition the King or either House of Par- 
liament." The Provincial Congress of New 
York, in 1775, had declined to declare in favor 
of independence, leaving " a so general and 
momentous concern to the Continental Con- 
gress." The recommendation of Congress to 
Massachusetts, that she take steps toward a 
provincial government in that colony, until 
the King's governor should consent to govern 
the colony according to its charter, " proves 
the truth of the saying of Lincoln, that the 
Union is not only older than the Constitution, 
but older than the States." The mere fact 
that in the Continental Congress each colony 
was allowed one vote " cannot in justice be 
made the basis for the later claims of the ad- 
vocates of State sovereignty." 

Though it may seem ungracious to question, 
in any respect, so excellent a treatise, it must 
be confessed that this work is in one way dis- 
appointing. The author seems inclined to treat 
with less than justice the efforts of the colonial 
Fathers in resisting the British aggressions. 
Their opposition to the Parliamentary claim of 
right to tax the colonies is clearly stated, but 
is pronounced groundless. 

" The right, though successfully questioned by the 
Americans, seems now, when we may calmly reflect over 
it, to be well founded in the principles of government." 

" The best argument against parliamentary taxation 
must be economic rather than legal, and must proceed 
from a revolutionary interpretation of government." 

" They denied the supreme power of Parliament to tax 
America, though without good authority for the denial." 

" Thus the Congress attempted to put the British 
government in the wrong." 

So it was that " Acts of Parliament, strictly 
legal and constitutional, became the ostensible 
excuse for American Independence." 

These impeachments of the legal ability of 
the colonial bar are coupled with two significant 
admissions : the accused were diligent students 
of the Constitution, and they were honest in 
their convictions. 

" The Americans were thoroughly convinced of the 
truth and justice of their own interpretation of consti-

tutional principles, [and] it is not unjust to say that, at 
this time, the idea of constitutional government was 
more clearly recognized in America than in England." 

Yet he compares these colonials with those 
who in 1861 proposed to sever the Union, and 
says that, with the beginning of the Revolu- 
tion, "nullification was rapidly becoming seces- 
sion." These are our author's generalizations, 
without either explanation in argument or 
citations of authority. The constitutional argu- 
ments of John Dickinson against the Parlia- 
mentary power of taxation over the colonies, 
and of John Adams and James Wilson against 
the existence of any legislative power of Par- 
liament whatever over the colonies, in 1774, 
were based on numerous early British prece- 
dents. If these arguments are to be condemned 
by the impartial historian as groundless, they 
should be shown to be either inherently weak, 
or overweighted by sound adverse arguments. 

There are other generalizations in our au- 
thor's work which seem to be hastily made. 
It is said of the introduction by Randolph into 
the Federal convention in 1787, of the Virginia 
plan, contemplating a national government, 
consisting of a supreme legislative, executive, 
and judiciary, that " this was the first use of 
the term national, in the sense in which it is 
now commonly understood." If it be desirable 
to fix the earliest use of this term, further in- 
vestigation may be needed. Aside from its 
use by individuals, as by Washington and 
Paine, in 1783, it is found in the Report of the 
Committee of Congress, drawn by Madison, 
under date of September 25, 1783, on the me- 
morial from Massachusetts respecting the grant 
of half-pay to the officers of the army, wherein 
that measure is referred to as " an act finally 
adopted, and the national faith pledged to 
carry it into effect." Again, it is said : 

" It is difficult to fix the exact time or occasion when 
the word Nation was first employed to describe the 
government of the American people, but there is reason 
to believe that one of the first uses of the word in this 
sense was made by President Lincoln in his Gettysburg 
address, in which he spoke of the Government of the 
People as that of ' a new Nation, conceived in liberty, and 
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created 
equal.'" 

To take this view, we must forget that in 
1793 Judge Wilson of the Supreme Court 
found it easy to answer affirmatively the ques- 
tion, " Do the people of the United States form 
a Nation " (and this with a big N) ; and that 
in his answer he said : 

" The people of the United States intended to form 
themselves into a nation for national purposes. They 
instituted, for such purposes, a national government 



complete in all its parts, with powers legislative, ex- 
ecutive, and judiciary, and in all these powers extend- 
ing over the whole nation." 

It is with regret that the reviewer has found 
occasion to qualify, by these discriminations, 
his commendation of a work so well conceived, 
and, in most respects, so admirably accom- 
plished. JAMES OSCAR PIERCE. 



A JOURNEY TO NATURE.* 

About six months ago, a series of papers 
appearing weekly in the New York " Evening 
Post " attracted our attention. They were 
written in a style that was noteworthy even 
among the excellent literary papers that one 
habitually finds in that journal, and as the 
chapters went on from week to week, we found 
ourselves eagerly awaiting the Saturday issue 
of the " Post " in which a continuation of the 
series might be expected. Presently they came 
to an end, but we were confident of their res- 
urrection in a book, so clearly deserving they 
were of the more substantial form of publica- 
tion. The confidence was justified, and the 
entire series is now reproduced under the title 
" A Journey to Nature," while in place of the 
mysterious initials "J. P. M." (which sug- 
gested to us nothing but the name of Mr. J. 
Pierpont Morgan), we find upon the title-page 
the name of Mr. J. P. Mowbray. 

The book is remarkable in more ways than 
one, and is sure to attract much attention. Its 
humor, its philosophy, its pungency of style, 
and its wholesome view of life are qualities that 
go to the making of literature rather than of 
journalism, and more than once, while reading 
the several chapters in their original form, we 
felt that we were enjoying some such rare ex- 
perience as was enjoyed by the fortunate dis- 
coverers of " My Summer in a Garden " in the 
columns of the Hartford " Courant," or even 
of the " Essays of Elia " in the pages of the 
" London Magazine." Now re-reading the 
papers in their collective form, our early im- 
pression is deepened, although we are conscious 
of an occasional reservation of praise of the sort 
that almost necessarily results when the mental 
attitude is shifted from that of a skimmer of 
newspapers to that of a reader of books. But 
these reservations are very slight indeed, affect- 
ing only a word or a phrase here and there, and 
more than adequate compensation is offered for

a few trifling defects in the sense of continuity 
and artistic unity that we get when the book is 
taken at a single reading. 

In a way, the book is a story-book, although 
the whole of its story may be told in a few 
words. Briefly, it deals with the experiences 
of a Wall Street stock-broker, plunged in the 
thick of business and social life, and suddenly 
confronted with the vision of sudden death. 
An attack of heart failure pulls him up short, 
and hurries him into the country for a cure. 
He is a man in the forties, a widower, with 
one small boy, Charlie, whom he takes along. 
The place of refuge provided is a cabin, an 
appanage of a decayed manorial homestead, 
somewhere in Central New York. In this 
cabin the man and the child and a yellow dog 
set up a primitive form of housekeeping, being 
cared for in the grosser ways by Gabe Hotch- 
kiss, the farmer who occupies the homestead, 
and ministered unto in somewhat more delicate 
fashion by his niece Griselle. These are the 
dramatis personce of the story, these, and 
the Doctor, who, delighted to have found a 
patient who will take his advice, comes out 
now and then to see how things are getting 
along. The book is made up of communings 
with nature, the natural incidents of vaga- 
bond life, occasional dialogue, and Griselle. 
This young woman seems to be merely a lay 
figure in the earlier chapters, but her person- 
ality is gradually insinuated into the substance 
of the story, until she more than shares the 
interest with the narrator himself. The author's 
management of this charming person is the 
most artistic feature of his work. Casual ob- 
servation, curiosity, sympathetic attention, 
sentimental interest, affection, love, and chas- 
tened disappointment, these are the successive 
notes in the gamut of the relationship between 
the man and the maiden. It is a familiar se- 
quence, but one not often presented with such 
delicacy and charm. 

But quite enough has been written about 
and around this book ; let us turn to the more 
convincing task of illustration. The exile has 
arrived at his cabin, and has set his teeth in 
grim determination to " stick it out." 

" This was the bravado of the will, and even while 
it was flourishing I was . conscious that I would give 
the hovel and the two big boxes that had been set down 
at its door for a cocktail. 

" I asked the two men who had driven us and the 
boxes up where I could get some ice and a lemon. They 
looked at each other as if I had asked them for a French 
menu. ' Ice ? ' said one of them. ' You might git some 
at the butcher's in Spelldown. It 's four miles and a 



half. There 's a spring in the medder yonder, but the 
lemon crop ain't very good this year.' 

" That 's so,' said his companion, wiping his face 
with his shirt-sleeves, ' the potato bugs hurt the young 
lemons awfully last season.' " 

The Doctor comes up for a few days of rough life, 
and is highly pleased with his patient's condition, 
until a chance remark awakens dark suspicion. 

" ' You 're convalescent that 's all. You must keep 
this jig up for one year. I do not propose to let up on 
my prescription, if you expect me to carry you through 
to a good old age. You see, I 've got a good deal at 
stake in this matter. You 've been a pretty good boy 
so far. I did not believe you could do it. In fact, 
you 're the first man I ever met who could give up 
female society entirely and take to the woods on sani- 
tary principles, and you will make a shining example 
when you go back to Broadway and Wall Street.' 

" At that moment Charlie came to the door and 
shouted, Say, Dad, where do you suppose Griselle 
keeps the pepper and salt ? ' 

" I remember that the Doctor, who looked very ab- 
surd in his bare feet, came over and stood in front of 
me, and said with as cavernous an intonation as he 
could command, ' Who in thunder is Griselle? ' " 

One night the invalid drinks coffee recklessly, 
has a nightmare, wakes up with violent heart- 
throbs, and loses his nerve completely. Think- 
ing of nothing else to do, he proposes to the 
yellow dog that they have a wood fire. 

" I might as well put down that dog's reply, if for 
no other reason than that it is a true dog's reply, and 
not man's, which dog talk is so apt to be. This is what 
he said, exactly: ' I can't make out what it is that you 
propose to do, but I understand in a general way that you 
are going to do something, and I 'm with you whatever it 
is. Let 's make as much hullabaloo about it as we can.' 

" I have learned that a dog apprehends a man's mean- 
ing very much as a man apprehends the meaning of a 
symphony. It is purely a matter of tones and not of 
articulations. He seizes upon your moods, not upon 
your ideas, with the marvellous generalizing capacity 
of a sympathetic ear. He responds to the allegros and 
andantes, appropriates the rhythms without conscious- 
ness, and keeps time to the feelings as they slip and 
merge. Man must be a continual Beethoven to a dog, 
uttering mystic strophes that he cannot analyze. A dog 
is thus superior to a man in that he is always saved 
from being a critic." 

One more passage may be given, illustrative of 
the graver moods of the book, and showing 
how well Nature did her work, no less for the 
soul than for the physical frame of her patient. 
It takes the form of a soliloquy. 

" I feel confident that a healthy adjustment of facul- 
ties, and the suspension of an agressive egotism, put a 
man en rapport with new harmonies that he never be- 
fore suspected. If he walk in the cordial but silent 
woods, he finds that the defiance goes out of his verte- 
brae, and he is acquiring the bowed head; and if we 
look narrowly here we shall find, I think, that the 
bowed head of the savant and the saint are the tokens 
of a similar but unequal humility. These conclusions 
bore into one's old timbers unobserved like the teredo,

when one lives apart from his fellows for a while; so 
that I grew to think, like the Doctor, that it was good 
for every man to have hermit hours, and to keep a wil- 
derness somewhere into which he can escape from him- 
self. In such sequestered moments tides of soft 
intimations come from afar, and there are apt to be 
astral banners fluttering in one's outreach whisper- 
ings of origins and outcomes, never before heard in the 
soft procession of the universes; faint, kindly voices 
reaching up from the lowliest processes, trying to speak of 
kinship and fatherhood. There are new and tiny links far 
down the inscrutable depths, and they glitter in the gloom 
with threads of promise, forever weaving the continuity 
and indestructibility of life ift a majestic synthesis." 

On the walls of the Doctor's city office, we 
are told, there was a Scriptural motto, " For 
thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of 
Israel. In returning and in rest ye shall be 
saved. In quietness and confidence shall be 
your strength, and ye would not." It is the 
lesson of this passage that "A Journey to Na- 
ture " inculcates, and the lesson is one that we 
Americans, more than most other people, need 
to learn. The book is an evangel of the quiet 
life, the life freed from the unnecessary per- 
plexities of man's own making, the true life of 
the spirit for which so many of us vainly strive. 
It is a beautiful book, and we count it a privi- 
lege to have had this opportunity of saying 
even these few inadequate words in its praise.

OUR CONTEMPORARY STAGE.* 

Mr. Norman Hapgood's volume, " The Stage 
in America, 1897-1900," treats those aspects 
of the acted drama which have played the 
most important part in American theatrical 
history during the past few years, besides pre- 
senting a purely critical consideration of the 
histrionic notabilities connected therewith. 
The purpose of the book so far as any chief 
purpose can be discovered in the work of one 
who is so emphatically a critic of detail 
seems to be to rescue from unmerited oblivion 
records of those productions worthy of a more 
enduring place than that which is given in 
the daily newspaper. Says the author : 

"So many influences enter into the formation of a 
dramatic opinion, or even into a mere narration of 
theatrical incident, that to select among the facts, im- 
pressions, and beliefs of four years those which sum up 
the period is full of peril. After reversing my view of 
Henry Esmond's ability in comedy, or of the degree of 
Mrs. Fiske's talent, what shall I think of my next con- 
viction ? The difficulty is not new: even Goethe has

good. New York : The Macmillan Co. 



written foolish things about Hamlet; the sharp differ- 
ence between him and Schiller over Egmont was on a 
subject where both were masters; the meanderings of 
Tolstoi's ' What la Art ? ' are matched by aberrations 
of Hume, Voltaire, Johnson, and Dryden." 

As a corollary to this we may add that dra- 
matic criticism is one of the most difficult 
forms of criticism, for it has no written form- 
ula, no stereotyped standard, to fall back upon. 
It is man's opinions based on man's knowledge 
of preexisting and present conditions, on man's 
accepted and preconceived conclusions as to 
what should constitute the ideal form of that 
particular branch of art under discussion, and 
of man's understanding of the technique of the 
drama. The highest and brightest achieve- 
ment in dramatic criticism is reached when the 
critic remains true to his own convictions, 
albeit his ultimate conclusions may be at vari- 
ance with the world at large, for every thought 
of the true critic assimilates, respires, and en- 
larges in that sphere of art which he has 
chosen to study ; and in arguing with oneself 
one has always a respectful antagonist to whose 
objections every attention must be given. 

Mr. Hapgood touches upon the problems of 
the stage in a manner which reveals a clear 
and comprehensive insight. In speaking of 
the theatrical trust (a product of one of the 
gloomy qualities of American life : the exces- 
sive love of wealth) he says : 

"Its growth was rapid, its power immense, and the 
history of its rise, if intimately known, sounds like a 
melodrama or a satirical romance. . . . This syndicate 
can say to the theater owner: 'If yon do not do busi- 
ness with us on our own terms, we will not let you have 
first-rate attractions. If you do, we will destroy your 
rival, or force him to the same terms. For the book- 
ings we will take a share of the profits.' To the actor 
or traveling manager it can say: Yon must play in our 
theaters or in barns. For our theaters we make our own 
terms.' To both it can say: ' Nominally, we act as your 
agents. In reality, we are your absolute masters.' " 

These sentiments are voiced by the majority 
of our actors and critics. 

In his chapter on " The Drama of Ideas," 
the author proves himself to be a diseur de 
boil-mots, as the following quotations, picked 
at random, will attest : 

" It was a sadly demoralized man who said he had 
three rules for the conduct of life; of which the first 
was, never to see the plays of Henry Arthur Jones, and 
the other two did not matter but it was an artist 
also and a critic who spoke." 

" The kinship between intellectual innocence and real 
culture is what makes bad melodramas so good and 
good melodramas so bad." 

" The greatest literary ideas are dramatic ideas ; most 
of the world's highest literature is poetry, and most of 
its highest poetry is drama. We need not fear that 



336 



THE DIAL 



modern times are undramatic, for artistic genius is 
creative, and when it exists it will create somewhat in 
its universal manner." 

" Great dramatic ideas are imaginative and emotional 
conceptions, and the nearest to an exact statement that 
can be made about them will tell what feeling of life 
they imbue." 

Mr. Hapgood tells us that there is a drama, 
not large but distinct, which belongs espe- 
cially to the United States of to-day, and, 
whether lasting or not, to contemporary ob- 
servers seems to move on more artistic princi- 
ples than any native plays of the past. 

" Two men stand, as far as we can see, clearly ahead 
of their predecessors: James A. Herne for intellectual 
qualities, supported by considerable stagecraft; William 
Gillette for the playwright's talents, working on ideas 
of his own. Their plays are equaled by single efforts 
of other men, but no other American dramatist has done 
as much of equal merit." 

Speaking of American humor, he reminds us 
that a certain form of humor, not the high- 
est, and yet not unrelated to the larger kind, 
is found as incessantly in our farces and va- 
riety shows as in our presidential campaigns. 
" Fatalism and buoyancy, love of exaggeration, 
and a taste for slang are some of the compon- 
ents." But he merely lessens the dignity of 
his arguments by inserting some very insipid 
quotations from broad farces and burlesques 
which, for some reason or other, draw intel- 
lectual audiences to a certain metropolitan 
music hall. Who was it that said human nature 
in America is somewhat like the articles in a 
great exhibition, where the largest and loudest 
things first catch the eye and usurp the attention? 
Upwards of forty years ago, George Henry 
Lewes, speaking of the frivolous character of 
our plays, said : " Unless a frank recognition 
of this inevitable tendency cause a decided 
separation of the drama which aims at art 
from those theatrical performances which only 
aim at amusement of a lower kind (just as 
classic music keeps aloof from all contact and 
all rivalry with comic songs and sentimental 
ballads), and unless this separation takes place 
in a decisive restriction of one or more theatres 
to the special performance of comedy and the 
poetic drama, the final disappearance of the 
art is near at hand." This quotation is not 
inserted for the sake of calling attention to 
and praising the so-called "palmy days" of 
the stage, but merely as a preliminary remark 
in calling attention to the fact that, according 
to Mr. Hapgood, there is only one high-class 
theatre in America : the Irving Place Theatre, 
in New York, where the running of a theatre 
is looked upon more as an art than as a trade. 



But as all productions are here given in Ger- 
man, its clientelage is limited. 

It is impossible to do more than point out 
the general purpose of the book under consid- 
eration. The titles of the principal chapters 
give an idea of the numerous topics treated : 
" Ibsen," " Recent Shakespeare," " Foreign 
Tragedy," "Rostand," " Pinero, Shaw, and 
Jones," " From the French," " Histrionic and 
Literary Side-shows," etc. We are glad to note 
that the performances ^iven through the efforts 
of the Independent Theatre Company, which 
had its headquarters for two years at the Car- 
negie Lyceum in New York, have been given 
the space that they deserve. 

Mr. Hapgood is " nothing if not critical "; 
but whereas that expression, as applied by lago 
to himself, denoted a mind especially on the 
alert to discover weak points in everything, it 
means something essentially different as applied 
to the present critic. In fact, the author shows 
himself to be a kind of Benthamite in art. It 
is true that there are some statements made 
which he may some day wish to withdraw. The 
peculiarity of his critical ability consists in his 
power of assimilating the thoughts and the 
work of others its pliancy is its strength.

RECENT ENGLISH POLITICAL, 
PHILOSOPHY.* 

Our age forsooth is still in the throes of 
transition. We begin the twentieth century 
with a number of problems and questions per- 
taining to their solution which have by no 
means found even approximately satisfactory 
answers. New ideas and theories chase each 
other like clouds on the spiritual horizon. That 
they are but clouds is due largely to the lack 
of true philosophical training in those who at- 
tempt to advance them. It is sometimes even 
painful to witness the vagueness of issue com- 
pared with the ado with which the answer is 
sought. The blending of sociological with 
political and historical ideas, or rather the 
forcing of the two latter to conform to the still 
somewhat indefinite and artificial reasoning of 
sociology, is more of a confusion than an assist- 
ance to a reader. Against the sense of in- 
security thus produced, it is an antidote to 
turn back upon the path, and review with some

friendly author the work of those serious think- 
ers of the past whose labor has largely con- 
tributed to raise the foundation on which the 
present edifice of social and political reasoning 
is erected, and whose efforts have largely 
proved true. Thus it is possible, by way of 
contrast, to bring into comparison two recent 
books whose difference in scope and treatment 
would scarcely suggest each other. In a way 
they may serve as fair examples of the philo- 
sophical and the unphilosophical attitude of 
many writers of to-day. 

Professor Graham's " English Political 
Philosophy from Hobbes to Maine " is one of 
the serious contributions to the study of polit- 
ical theory which thoughtful people welcome. 
We recognize that there is nothing especially 
new and original in the author's presentation 
of his thoughts about these writers. The book 
would have been very well named " Introduc- 
tion to the Study of," etc. It strikes one 
largely as a course of lectures condensed for 
convenient purposes into book form, explana- 
tory, discursive, rather scholastic in tone and 
not very argumentative. The criticism applied 
to the theories of these authors is drawn from 
the later discoveries in the world of thought 
and from the burning problems of to-day which 
their ideas have not succeeded in solving, and 
it is no wonder that they crumble before so 
fierce a light. The treatment is not perfunc- 
tory nor shallow but earnest and painstaking, 
and therefore the book will doubtless become a 
considerable help and guide to the serious 
student. And to become such a guide is, as 
we understand it, the author's special object. 
By bringing the six foremost English thinkers 
upon political theory within one frame, and 
discussing their relation to each other and to 
other philosophers, a continuity in the devel- 
opment of thought is presented which one 
otherwise does not easily meet with. Locke is 
usually studied from the point of view of ab- 
stract philosophy, Burke from the point of 
view of literary merit, and Mill in connection 
with Political Economy, whose chief light he 
is. The study of Hobbes we believe is almost 
obsolete, and Bentham too is usually taken up 
only incidentally, since the memory of these 
first explorers in the realm of Political Science 
is obscured by the fame of their far more suc- 
cessful followers. Professor Graham finds both 
Hobbes and Bentham (and Burke, too, for all 
that) lacking in penetration of thought and 
grasp upon actuality, but in his appreciation 
of their fundamental value he is both sincere 



and just. With Burke it seems difficult for 
him to distribute the sun and shade of valua- 
tion properly. Burke's greatest, and in our 
opinion his only, fault was his lack of under- 
standing of such a tremendous departure from 
the slow beaten track of social progress as the 
French Revolution. Burke was of course wrong 
in this ; yet he was the only statesman in Eu- 
rope who said anything against it which was 
neither puerile in tone nor bigoted in idea, 
which, on the contrary, has been generally pro- 
ductive of good to this day. It is indeed 
strange that as an Irishman, to rebellion bred, 
he should so misconstrue everything done on 
the other side of the Channel ; although if it 
had been for the immediate deliverance of his 
own race, he might have sanctioned much. If 
Burke had not been ground so steadily and 
thoroughly in the English Parliamentary flour 
mill, he might have looked at matters differ- 
ently, and he, the English subject, not been 
outdone in liberal sympathies by the nobleman 
of hard feudal stock, the Prussian Count Schla- 
brendorf, who hastened to France in anticipa- 
tion of the new star of liberty to be born there, 
and lived through most of the Jacobin sessions 
of stormy memory. But when will Celt ever 
understand Celt? 

Bentham, as a political theorist, will claim 
more of the interest of our readers than Burke, 
largely because America is the country where 
his doctrine of the greatest happiness for the 
greatest number has been more generally ad- 
hered to and realized. Yet his prophetic words 
in the defence of security, even if it be at the 
expense of equality (p. 223), may well resound 
in the minds of many who watch the gradual 
change from an individually independent to a 
semi-feudal relation which the lower social lay- 
ers are fast undergoing, conditions which have 
come " for to stay " and will not be discussed 
away. We quote his words : " When security 
and equality are in conflict it will not do to 
hesitate for a moment. Equality must yield. 
The first is the foundation of life ; subsistence, 
abundance, happiness, everything depends upon 
it. Equality produces only a certain portion 
of good. Besides, whatever we may do, it will 
never be perfect ; it may exist a day ; but the 
revolutions of the morrow will overturn it. 
The establishment of a perfect equality is a 
chimera ; all we can do is to diminish inequal- 
ity." Still more interesting is Bentham's de- 
mand that the laws be codified and made 
accessible in form and content to everybody. 
As Professor Graham expresses his wish : 



338 



THE DIAL 



[May 16, 



" If now the laws which concern everybody were in 
one volume, and those which concerned only classes 
were in small separate volumes, if the general code had 
become, as with the Hebrews, a part of worship and a 
manual of education; if a knowledge of it were required 
as a condition of the franchise, the law would then be 
truly known, every citizen would become its guardian, 
its violation would not be a mystery, its explanation 
would not be a monopoly, and fraud and chicane would 
no longer be able to elude it " (p. 231). 

We believe it would have given the venerable 
philosopher a genuine delight if he could have 
beheld as perhaps through celestial omnis- 
cience he has the late publication of the 
Civil Code of the German Empire, printed for 
everybody's use in a small volume which can 
be held in the hollow of one's hand, yet read 
with perfect ease and costing but a mark. But we 
shall have to wait long before such a boon is given 
to this lawyer and judge ridden community. 

Speaking of Bentham's impossible Love of 
Humanity, Professor Graham says with a touch 
of some pertness : 

" As far as the love of humanity ' is concerned, it is 
not here necessary to inquire how far it is possible to 
have any definite feeling for a vast entity like humanity, 
the best and noblest part of which is dead and passed 
away, while some part is not yet born, and much of what 
is alive and concrete may affect us in a manner that 
arouses anything but love. To form the conception of 
such is difficult, to have any real feeling for the com- 
posite object of it, is difficult. But it is perhaps psycho- 
logically possible to have a kind of love for the vast 
Being (much of which is not in being) through its best 
representatives, who are chiefly and necessarily the 
mighty dead, whose character and works are beyond 
dispute " (p. 199). 

How will that do in America where Shake- 
speares and Michel Angelos of to-day, if we 
trust the local reporter, are neither few nor 
far between, and admirable characters, accord- 
ing to Bostonian terminology, are not rare, but 
in fact crowding the public theatre so that 
there is hardly standing room ? We warn the 
pessimists of Professor Graham's type off the 
planks, for they will surely be hooted at ! And 
after all, is love of humanity as a distinct part 
of one's make-up such an impossibility ? It is 
all very well, as Professor Graham suggests, 
to do the best we can for ourselves and those 
who depend upon us, and let the matter rest 
there, but there is such a thing as generous 
sympathy with outsiders just because it is a 
beautiful thing to be friendly and " God loveth 
a glad giver." This feeling of genuine warmth 
and good will toward all till they themselves 
repel us a feeling which makes one beloved 
by his fellow beings, and lifts the meeting of 
strangers into a charming experience, we 
look upon as not at all an impossibility. True, 



in spite of our philanthropy and altruism, this 
precious feeling as a gift, a disposition, seems 
to have faded out of our too practical lives and 
is now preserved in the original force only by 
a few simpletons. This feeling, it appears, is 
the real love of humanity ; which evidently 
Bentham did not invent, but which he had 
pigeonholed properly in his theoretical mind 
and was going to advocate as worth striving 
for. If, in fact, the genuine article were dis- 
tributed more widely, and were less spoiled by 
the influence of some " cause " or other urging 
the individual to act in a stereotyped way, it 
would bring the gentle tact that prevents fric- 
tion, and the losses and crosses of life would be 
not left to specialists, as Professor Graham 
suggests (p. 198), but be borne by everybody ; 
and we boldly state that if love of humanity 
becomes a cumbrance rather than a help, that 
is because true goodness is largely lacking. 

But we will leave this difficult subject, and 
make our only general criticism of Professor 
Graham's mode of discussion. He is some- 
times so given over to common sense that he 
becomes rather trite. But this and the frequent 
repetitions are faults easily committed in books 
of this kind where clearness and simplicity are 
necessary characteristics. 

Mr. John M. Robertson's book, " An Intro- 
duction to English Politics," will presumably 
cause a good deal of controversy between the 
adherents of the old and the new school of his- 
torical writing. Mr. Robertson is rather a 
rabid modernist ; the historical writers of many 
nations pass in review before him, are all 
weighed, and found wanting. What is it, then, 
that Mr. Robertson himself must supply, since 
it is nowhere else to be found ? Briefly stated, 
it appears to be the presentation of some all- 
important phases of a nation's life explained 
primarily by sociological causes, with the pur- 
pose not only of furthering a new doctrine, but 
also with the noble intention of thus teaching 
the nations of to-day, particularly those of 
English speech, to avoid mistakes already com- 
mitted and occasionally repeated. No one can 
feel anything but sympathy with such an at- 
tempt. The question is whether Mr. Robert- 
son is successful in proving his point, and 
whether the method employed speaks in his 
favor as an independent and at the same time 
profound thinker. But Mr. Robertson himself 
disclaims any thoroughness, which of course 
is for him the saving clause. 

The book consists of five parts, the first 
treating of political evolution, particularly 



1901.]

among the Romans and Greeks ; the second 
concerned with economic forces among these 
and also among the Byzantines. Part Three 
discusses the culture-progress in antiquity ; 
Part Four the Italian Republics. Part Five 
deals with the fortune of the lesser European 
states. In fact, the book covers a vast field, 
and presents matters in themselves exceedingly 
difficult to handle. Nor are they rendered 
easier by the fact that the author depends evi- 
dently, if not confessedly, on second hand in- 
vestigation. His views are those acquired 
mainly by the reading of other authors, and 
his book is largely a discussion of their views. 
Although the author says both good and true 
things, his pages contain less of what is indi- 
vidually the result of his labors than a constant 
polemic against the faulty opinions of other 
writers. It is sometimes amusing, sometimes 
exasperating, to find this incessant warfare. 
Mr. Robertson's own points often have very 
little weight ; he applies his theory loosely or 
substitutes merely new words for other words, 
a new theory for an old, for, e. g., the seven 
points in Paragraph Four of Chapter II., Part 
I., which give very little help to anybody in 
finding a new solution for the old question why 
Rome was thus and not otherwise. Besides, 
by virtue of the uncertainty of the remote 
past, any statement, however vague and inad- 
equate, can summon imaginary proof and as- 
sume the aspect of truth ; but to establish this 
truth beyond dispute is the difficult thing, and 
therein most writers fall short, Mr. Robertson, 
be it said, not less than any other.* 

Part Two of the book (to which we can de- 
vote but scant attention) is by all means the 
best. Here as elsewhere the author employs 
the racy disjointed style of a notebook rather 
than the dull logical reasoning of a thesis. The 
common use of the words " faculty " and " in- 
nate genius " may indeed be unscientific, but 
Mr. Robertson's ridicule of them and insistence 
only on outside causes quite overlooks the fact 
that there is also something in the mind of a 
nation that moulds its fate. If perchance 
faculty means nothing more than the capacity 
to take advantage of opportunities, there is no 
denying that some nations, taken as a whole, 
possess this faculty very much as some indi- 
viduals do. If, therefore, in Part One Mr. 
Robertson explains the constitutionalism of 

*One may be permitted to think of Professor Theodor 
Mommsen's amused smile, if his eye should meet Mr. Rob- 
ertson's verdict upon his *' strenuous superficiality." We 
may question whether all things considered the super- 
ficiality of our esteemed writer is even strenuous. 



Rome by general indifferent causes in which 
conscious striving had no share, it is not pos- 
sible to see that he has come nearer to solving 
the problem why constitutional life had so 
much more of a chance in Rome than else- 
where. In Rome political life had less inter- 
ference from outside, if that is what he means ; 
but even so the faculty for constitutionalism 
remains. Mr. Robertson says (Part One) 
justly enough that Rome was in for plunder 
and went on plundering, the mythical wolf 
which nourished her infant kings remaining, 
as it were, her symbol. This thought is further 
carried out in Part Two, where it is stated 
that military expansion was an economic need 
and that the perpetual despoilment of the 
provinces was the chief doctrine of Roman 
economic law. But did Rome give the prov- 
inces nothing in return ? What had they pos- 
sessed before, and what did they possess after, 
the incorporation in her vast body politic ? A 
nation conquering so vast a territory and or- 
ganizing it on a military scale, it is true 
teaches the world at least one of the chief prin- 
ciples of civilization, i. e., subordination, dis- 
cipline. That Rome abused her power was a 
result of the limitations of that same system, 
lacking as it did any outlet in individual effort. 
But that Rome developed a system of law, a 
monument of its conception of subordination, 
speaks for its having an ideal of life which we 
now are unable properly to criticize and from 
whose faults we can after all profit very little, 
because the basis of our existence lies elsewhere. 
Certain phases which can serve as illustrations 
of his theory Mr. Robertson treats, others which 
demand more acute questioning, he lets lie. 

Mr. Robertson is justly incensed against 
slavery, too, and sees the source of the economic 
decline of the Roman empire in this " under- 
buying" the labor of the free worker. No 
doubt; but where lies the remedy for such 
sporadically returning change of social status ? 
Under certain conditions slavery appears as a 
lamentable necessity. If the signs far and 
near do not entirely mislead us, we are on the 
verge of such an age ourselves, when human 
life is too cheap to be maintained except by 
the severest drudgery. Life is after all nothing 
but a perpetual experiment with contingencies 
of which no generation can foresee the result ; 
one age tries one remedy, another tries a dif- 
ferent ; the outcome can never be permanent, and 
the rotation of layers in the course of time brings 
one at the top, while another sinks far below. 

In spite of certain defects, for which we can

prescribe no particular remedy, since they are 
inherent in the writer's view, Mr. Robertson's 
book will very likely create interest as a con- 
troversial contribution to the understanding of 
history. One thing is certain, the author is 
very much in earnest. His book is no doubt 
a well-meant effort and a most energetic one 
toward establishing new standards of practical 
value, especially toward awakening interest in 
the study of history as a source of political 
wisdom, of which many, both nations and in- 
dividuals, may be sadly in need.

It should hardly be necessary to point out that 
the prevailing fashion of historical fiction differs 
very little from its kindred fashion of contempo- 
raneous history in either intention or effect. In 
both the writer makes a study of the time and the 
occurrences within it, selecting the material which 
is most available for his purpose, straining it through 
his prepossessions and prejudices, and producing 
reading matter which is intended to be interesting 
and may or may not be accurate. If by any 
chance it comes out fair, impartial, and inclusive, 
the gods are to be thanked for unusual mercies ; if 
not, it will still compare quite favorably with all 
the other books in the world which make historical 
pretensions, from Herodotus, " the Father of Lies," 
to Sir Walter Raleigh, who could obtain no corrob- 
orative evidence for what he saw in a chance-medley 
beneath his window in the Tower. 

Mr. John F. Bass has recently borne testimony 
that the facts as he learned them at first hand in 
the Philippine Archipelago have not been disclosed 
with either accuracy or completeness ; yet it seems 
certain that there are fewer prejudices involved in 
that struggle than in the analogous battling in 
South Africa. The United States has not been 
operating, so to speak, in the face of the world, and 
the constant travel between Manila and San Fran- 
cisco has been on the other side of the world, and 
away from the forum of Christendom. Great Brit- 
ain has been conducting her plans for the extinction 
of two Republics in a manner which has earned her 
the hatred of continental Europe, arousing the bit- 
terest feelings of partisanship and (so-called)

patriotism on both sides of the Channel, and leaving 
the critics and criticized equally impassioned and 
equally prone to special pleading. It would seem 
that some American, bound to England by the ties 
of a common language, common laws, and common 
aspirations, and bound to the doughty burghers by 
love for self-government, for independence, and for 
liberty of national action, should make the best and 
fairest historian of the war which is still waging on 
the South African veldt. When such a book comes, it 
will certainly be welcomed. But it is not before us yet. 

All these considerations become effective when 
such a work as the " London Times " has under- 
taken comes into the critic's hands. In the first of 
its five large octavo volumes, edited by Mr. L. S. 
Amery, a fellow of All Souls College, there would 
seem to be room for the dispassionate presentation 
of both sides of the controversy within the 392 
pages which carry the reader from the year 1815, 
when the Congress of Vienna confirmed the British 
title to the Cape, to the beginning of actual hostili- 
ties, on October 12, 1900. True, the "London 
Times" has been notoriously the organ of the ex- 
treme imperial faction of the Conservative party, 
and any editor it might select must represent its 
editorial policy ; yet the " Times " has borne a 
great reputation for accuracy and candor in days 
gone by, and it has published communications, if 
not despatches, in its columns which did not leave 
the Republics without some advocacy. 

The work clearly shows an endeavor to give 
everything which can elucidate the matters in dis- 
pute. It contains an extraordinary number of 
portraits in photogravure, and in these Briton and 
Boer are certainly represented with all impartiality. 
There is a map ; and there are appendices contain- 
ing a chronological table of events in South African 
history and many excerpts from official documents. 
But the place of honor, the frontispiece, is given 
the Rt. Hon. Joseph Chamberlain ; the map assumes 
the incorporation of the two Republics into the 
British Empire as a fact accomplished ; and the 
conventions- which are contained in the appendices 
are not complete, and one, at least, of the omissions 
is injurious to the presentation of the burgher 
cause. In like manner the Editor's Introductory 
follows his Preface in a confession of the failure 
of impartiality, and in acting along the lines of a 
policy announced in the following words : 

" The present volume has been written frankly from 
the point of view of one who is convinced that the es- 
sential right and justice of the controversy have been 
with his own country, and that the policy which has 
been pursued by the British Government has been, both 
politically and morally, justifiable. There is, no doubt, 
a Boer side to the controversy, a point of view based 
on the memory of old grievances, on peculiar social and 
political ideals, on a far-reaching national ambition. 
But it is a side which it is not easy for the ordinary 
reader to sympathize with, unless he can both appreciate 
and share the sentiments which have animated the 
burghers of the Republics in their hostility to the Im- 
perial Government. To that side the present account,

in so far as it endeavors to give a true description of 
the Boer policy and of Boer aspirations, can do no real 
injustice. There is, however, another view with which 
the account given in this volume is entirely incompatible. 
That is the ' pseudo-Boer ' or ' pro- Boer ' view a view 
begotten mainly of ignorance as to the real character 
and aims of President Kruger's policy. ... It b a 
fictitious case." 

Perusal of the book will confirm this sufficiently 
candid declaration of its intent. It proceeds on 
the assumption that the Great Trek was an unau- 
thorized secession from British rule, though Sir 
Henry Cloete, cited as an authority for that period, 
leaves quite a different impression. It pays no at- 
tention to the works of the Rt. Hon. James Bryce, 
though it does rely on " Mr. Rider Haggard's vari- 
ous writings/' The chapter on the years following 
the Jameson Raid is from an anonymous hand 
an extraordinary failure of authority for the most 
critical and momentous period discussed in the vol- 
ume. The chapter on the movement which led to 
Imperial intervention is from the hand of Mr. W. F. 
Monypenny, at that time the editor of the " Star," 
a subsidized organ of the mine-owners, and later 
the correspondent of the " London Times " itself. 
Colonel Frank Rhodes is thanked for many valuable 
suggestions. Mr. J. F. van Oordt, though styled 
by Mr. Amery himself " a fanatical partizan," is 
relied upon to furnish ample refutation of what I 
have called the ' pseudo-Boer ' case." Truly, the 
history is poisoned at its sources. The four remain- 
ing volumes will deal with hostilities in the field. 

Mr. A. G. Hales, whose " Campaign Pictures " 
never lacks interest, is an Australian, the author of 
a well-received book of travel, and the special cor- 
respondent of the " London Daily News " during a 
part of the war. Attached to the Australian con- 
tingent under General Methuen, he was taken pris- 
oner by the Boers at the battle of Rensburg, released 
and returned to the British lines as a non-combat- 
ant by President Steyn after seeing much of the 
Boers in field, hospital, and camp, and only recalled 
to England after the victory at Thaba 'Nchu. His 
narrative is vivacious and, to a marked degree, im- 
partial. He bears willing testimony to the humanity 
and disinterested self-sacrifice of the burghers, and 
he does not consider himself in any way obligated 
to close his eyes to abuses on the British side. For 
that bloodthirstiest of all the English, the man who 
does all his fighting with his mouth, he has a few 
excoriating paragraphs, the close of one of them 
worth quoting, in view of what follows. 

" The old British pioneer may have whelped a few 
million good fighting stock in his time, but this class of 
animal is no lion's whelp; it is a thing all month and 
no manners, a shallow-brained, cowardly creature, al- 
ways howling about the Boer, but too discreet to go out 
and fight him, though ready at all times to malign him, 
to ridicule him as a farmer or a fighter. And it is a 
perfect bear's feast to this hybrid animal to get hold of 
a gullible newspaper correspondent to tell him gruesome 
tales relative to Boer fighting laagers." 



It must have been not one, but a dozen, of these 
cattle which undertook the education of Mr. Julian 
Ralph, whose book, " An American with Lord 
Roberts," is most misleadingly named. Mr. Ralph 
was the special correspondent of the " London 
Daily Mail," the British equivalent of those Amer- 
ican "yellow journals" which bragged about the 
little war with Spain as l - our war." Some allow- 
ance must doubtless be made for the policy of his 
paper, which would probably have rejected anything 
which did not seek the justification of Great Britain 
by unlimited abuse of the other side, but even with 
this made it is impossible to understand how Mr. 
Ralph could style himself ' an American " in any- 
thing but the purely technical sense of that much- 
abused word. He has no word of praise for any 
man who fought for the two Republics, and never 
a word of dispraise for those on the other side. It 
would not be difficult, if it were worth while, to pick 
absolutely contradictory statements out of the pages 
of Mr. Ralph and Mr. Hales, the former speaking 
on what he admits to be mere hearsay and the lat- 
ter from individual experience. Mr. Ralph's book, 
interestingly written as it is, remains chiefly valu- 
able as showing in an American what many of us 
have always taken to be the characteristic of the 
Briton abroad a willingness to believe anything 
that can expand the pages of a book. 

We much prefer to regard as the work of an 
American " in this most disastrous struggle be- 
tween Imperial Britain and the two Republics the 
efforts of Mr. Bartlett-Burdett-Coutts as set forth 
in his pamphlet, " The Sick and "Wounded in South 
Africa." Though a member of Parliament, this 
American-born English gentleman went at his own 
expense to the scene of war and distress, and having 
seen with his own eyes the evidences of the break- 
ing down of the military medical system under the 
burden of too much red tape and officialism, re- 
turned to make known the results of his journey 
from his seat in the national legislature. What he 
saw is made clear in his book ; but it is no less evi- 
dent that he incurred the displeasure of that class 
of devotees who see in the most rational criticism 
of their fellow-countrymen the voicing of treason 
Mr. Hales also incurred the same unreasoning 
slander. His account is therefore eked out with a 
re-statement of his position, made necessary by the 
misrepresentations of his enemies, indignant at his 
refusal, unlike Mr. Ralph, to be the servile mouth- 
piece of those who would further destroy the pres- 
tige of the English name by as much indifference 
to human suffering as there had been indifference 
to the rights of a foreign and weaker people. The 
book has on its cover the apt quotation " Lest we 
forget," a reminder to Americans that similar hor- 
rors in the Cuban campaign seem not to have bet- 
tered the attention given our soldiers in China, 
during the recent massacres and looting there.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



" A Treasury of Canadian Verse " 
An anthology (Button), edited by Dr. Theodore 

of Canadian song. V /', .11 iU i 

II. Rand, is an acceptable anthology 
of Canadian song. The editor himself is one of 
the veteran men of letters of his country, and has 
performed his task with skill and discrimination. 
One hundred and thirty-five writers are represented 
in all, and this number would have been greater by 
one were it not for the omission (through no edi- 
torial fault) of Mr. William Wilfred Campbell. 
Those who have not kept close watch of Canadian 
poetry will no doubt be surprised at the number of 
singers and at the high average quality of their 
work. It is difficult to fix upon characteristic 
qualities in the poetical expression of a whole peo- 
ple, and this collection, like similar anthologies of 
the verse of England and the United States, illus- 
trates nearly all of the moods and intellectual in- 
terests of the modern mind. There is one feature 
of Canadian song, however, which cannot fail to 
arrest the attention of even the casual reader. It 
is admirably expressed by the editor in these words : 
" Here are reflected the singular loveliness of our 
evanescent spring, the glow and luxuriant life of 
our hasting summer, the sensuous glory of our 
autumn, and the tingle of our frosty air and the 
white winter's cheer. Every form and aspect of 
natural beauty is, in some degree, caught and ex- 
pressed sometimes in homely, sometimes in clas- 
sical phrase ; often with striking simplicity, and 
generally with much purity of thought and an au- 
thentic note." The names of the poets here repre- 
sented include a few of wider than Canadian 
renown, the names of George J. Romanes, Grant 
Allen, and Professor Goldwin Smith, for examples. 
As for Professor Roberts and Mr. Carman we are 
now beginning to claim them as at least half our 
own, since they have taken up permanent residence 
on this side of the border. We regret the absence 
from this collection of Mr. Carman's " Death in 
April," the finest of all his poems, and probably 
the finest poem ever written by a Canadian. We 
miss also " The Palms " of Professor Roberts, al- 
though we are consoled by his matchless lyric " The 
Falling Leaves." There are brief biographical 
notes upon all the poets included, and we learn 
from them that Professor Roberts " was one of the 
literary arbiters at the World's Fair, Chicago," 
which is a dark saying. 

Dr. R. Osgood Mason supplements 

hi8 f orme . r lume ' " Telepathy and 
the Subliminal Self," by one en- 
titled " Hypnotism and Suggestion in Therapeutics, 
Education, and Reform " (Holt). The matter and 
manner of both books are much the same. Dr. 
Mason emphasizes the increased scope of the mental 
factor in the treatment of disease, and the specific 
opportunities afforded by hypnotic suggestion in 
this respect. But the success of such psychic thera- 



peutics, as likewise of the presentation of the topic 
to a wider public, depends on the tact and acumen, 
the critical ability and foresight, the avoidance of 
exaggeration and error, with which it is done. On 
all these points the present volume, when weighed 
fairly, is found to be wanting. There is a fair 
measure of good material ; the account of cases 
treated is particularly interesting and worthy of 
record ; and when compared with such a pernicious 
volume as the recent one of Quackenbos, this book 
assumes a comparatively meritorious character. 
But when judged by what an account of this topic 
should be, its success is quite overshadowed by its 
defects. Much of the volume is concerned with 
exaggerated theories of the influence of the uncon- 
scious self, with telepathy which foresees the future, 
and with rapport which transcends ordinary men- 
tal powers. Within the special field of hypnotic 
education, we have not only cases of nervous weak- 
nesses, bad habits, and mental assymetries success- 
fully treated by hypnotic suggestion ; but even bad 
spelling and incorrect English yield to this per- 
suasive method. But it is not so much the aesthetic 
judgment of the author that arouses condemnation 
as his intellectual judgment. The most weakly 
evidenced occurrences, the most weakly established 
theories, are considered as of equal importance and 
credibility as any others ; while any refusal to agree 
with the author in these peregrinations is set down 
to prejudice and lack of fair-mindedness. Such a 
democracy of facts and hypotheses in which there 
shall be freedom and equality to one and all, would 
be bereft of all logical worth. It is not open- 
mindedness that is wanted in the discussion of these 
problems so much as it is critical judgment and 
logical insight. Men do not to-day refuse to look 
through any telescope that promises to show them 
anything worth looking at. Stubbornness and dog- 
matism are not the bugbears that they are generally 
regarded to be. It is not any conservative clinging 
to old-fashioned balances t that prevents our results 
from being more reliable than they are ; but it is 
insufficient training in the employment of the new 
ones. And so long as this state of affairs continues, 
we shall have writers like Dr. Mason mixing to- 
gether much that is reliable and suggestive (and 
still more that is interesting), with much more that is 
questionable in all respects, serving uncritical res- 
urrections of Reichenbach's sensitives, and theories 
of psychic intuition, and explanations of heredity 
by subconscious personalities, and abuses of the sig- 
nificance of " experimental psychology," along with 
some valid and pertinent considerations of the 
scope of the mental in the treatment of physical, 
intellectual, moral, and educational deficiencies. 

Albert Sonnichsen, the author of 
SJt: "Ten Months a Captive among Fili- 
pinos " (Scribner), is what his por- 
trait shows him to be, and his book abundantly 
proves, a young American of great candor, great 
adaptability, little learning, and none too intelligent

prejudices. His book is, as the sub-title declares, 
'A Narrative of Adventure and Observation during 
Imprisonment on the Island of Luzon," and the 
map showing his itinerary attests the opportunities 
given him for seeing the workings of Aguinaldo's 
government during the time he was held prisoner. 
Interesting as the account is, the chief interest lies 
in the facts that the author did not know himself 
to be disclosing. He is not aware, for example, 
that he is constantly judging his captors by a 
standard which he does not make the slightest at- 
tempt to live up to himself a common fault with 
us all, perhaps, but more than ordinarily significant 
when the attitude of the writer is one of inevitable 
and invincible superiority. Another instance is to 
be found in the fact that his chief miseries came, 
not in the least from his darker-skinned guards, but 
from a fellow-member of the Anglo-Saxon race, an 
Englishman whom be significantly calls Arnold. 
Taken just before the American rifles, advanced 
several miles beyond the environs of Manila, to 
which they were limited by the terms of the peace 
protocol, had opened fire upon our recent allies, 
young Sonnichsen was enabled to escape by Joaquin 
Alejandrino, and returned safely to Manila by the 
" Oregon." He bears cheerful witness to the hu- 
manity of the Filipinos, and to the huge distress 
brought upon them by the American occupation. 
His book is entertaining and instructive, and throws 
many valuable side-lights on the dark picture in the 
Philippines. 

Like other readers of Mr. Bernard 
Shaw's earlier plays, we looked for- 
ward to " Plays for Puritans " 
(Stone) with pleasurable anticipation. We read 
them with successive and often mingled feelings. 
The Prefaces, of course, gratified our love of smart- 
ness. " The Devil's Disciple," however, was a great 
disappointment at the beginning, and we only roused 
to a sort of conventional interest in the last act. 
We were amused at the succeeding note on Bur- 
goyne. At the beginning of " Cesar and Cleo- 
patra" our spirit needed stimulant, and the play 
provided what was wanted of the best quality. 
With the Notes our spirit sunk again, and " Captain 
Brassbound's Conversion " we began with a certain 
weariness. This was largely caused, however, by 
the philological difficulties interposed by the dia- 
lectic spelling in the first act, for on getting to the 
real matter we revived and finished in style. So 
that on the whole the net result was good : it is 
true that the book is not everywhere of the author's 
very best, but that is by no means remarkable. 
These plays are for Puritans because Mr. Shaw de- 
sires to harp on some other string than the amatory. 
He explains himself in one of the Prefaces : in the 
plays it appears that he appeals rather to a certain 
common-sense in mankind which is certainlv more 
inspiriting than the common sensuousness, as he 
might call it himself, which most other plays appeal 
to. This common-sense Caesar and Lady Cicely 



have so much of it and are so winning thereby 
is an excellent article, and Mr. Shaw's recognition 
of it constitutes his real realism. If only people 
would not pretend this and that, if only they would 
be real. In " The Devil's Disciple " we unfortu- 
nately (for ourselves) miss this element ; we find 
little more reality in the play than in the locality 
of the play, which is south of Boston and north of 
Albany and yet in New Hampshire, and, in addi- 
tion, a place where there were Presbyterians in 
1777. We do not get interested in " Diabolonian 
ethics " either in theory or practice. But Lady 
Cicely brings up the balance, leaving " Caesar and 
Cleopatra " to the good very decidedly. We 
cannot think this last a very playlike play, but it is 
excellent reading. Some things seem a trifle ab- 
surd, as when Britannus declares that there should 
be a matron when Cleopatra visits Cesar, and much 
has a contagions levity, as when Caesar is inspired 
to leap into the sea and swim to the Rhodian gal- 
leys and they toss Cleopatra into the water after 
him. Still it would be bad to have monotony even 
in excellence, and such breaks are doubtless useful 
as a relief from the serious strength and even 
thought of the piece as a whole. 

The name of Alexander Brown, of 
Nelson county, Virginia, has long 
been associated in the field of his- 
torical literature with some decided views upon the 
birth of America's free institutions. He would 
annihilate the decades of slow political evolution, 
and have Freedom in present-day garb step forth 
from the church at Jamestown or the cabin of the 
" Mayflower." His latest volume, " English Politics 
in Early Virginia" (Houghton), essays to prove 
that our founders first settled this country upon 
proper political charter rights but were wilfully 
robbed of this distinction by the crown's licensed 
historians." It is a kind of essence extracted from 
his " First Republic of the United States " and his 
" Genesis of the United States," but colored with 
defiance and reassertion. Like a stag at bay, he 
turns upon his critics in a kind of preface in the 
middle of the book, and at the same time discloses 
the woes of " the first person under the Republic 
to undertake sincerely the task of correcting this 
historic wrong." He confesses " the great difficulty 
of compiling a book in the best form for correcting 
the wrong impressions which have resulted from 
an almost absolute control over the history and all 
the evidences for nearly one hundred and fifty 
years, by the crown officials " ; the long search for 
" a publisher liberal enough and patriotic enough 
to undertake the publication of an article or a book 
opposing opinions which have grown gray with age 
and become popular " ; and then the difficulty of 
" selling a sufficient number of advance orders to 
justify the printing, etc." Yet he is led to rejoice 
that the press and historians who under former 
license might have burned his books and imprisoned 
him can now only " roast " him, as he puts it. Even

those who cannot follow him in reading into the

publishers, and the way in which 
these tender missives are being exploited as an asset 
by their thrifty custodians should be a caution to 
celebrities now living. The latter, it seems, if they 
dread this form of post-mortem publicity, will do 
well either to follow the example of Mr. Barkis 
when they go a-wooing, or else to see to it person- 
ally that their epistolary billings and cooings are 
consigned to the flames before their heirs and the 
public get a chance at them. We have now before 
us a very pretty volume of nearly three hundred 
pages containing " The Love- Letters of Victor 
Hugo " (Harper), to Mile. Adele Foucher, many or 
all of which have already been published in the 
magazines, where they naturally and deservedly 
attracted much attention, both on account of the 
great name of their author, and of their singular 
charm and interest as characteristic compositions of 
their kind. In his Introduction to the volume, the 
helpful, if somewhat rapturous, editor, M. Paul 
Meurice, assures us, by way of whetting our appe- 
tite for the banquet to follow, that, " They evidently 
were not written to be seen by other eyes than those 
of the girl he loved ; he constantly entreats her to 
burn them ; they are all the more valuable on that 
account." The above view will hardly commend 
itself to a delicate sense of propriety, and seems 
rather at odds with a well-known convention long 
prevalent among gentlemen. But there is no doubt 
that the unrestrictedly frank and self -revealing 
character of the letters, and their consequent value 
as records of the inner life of the writer, are in a 
way guaranteed by the fact that he wanted them 
kept secret; and this is perhaps what M. Meurice 
means to imply. The letters cover a period of two 
years, from 1820 to 1822. They are love-letters 
pure and simple, the rapturous outpourings of a 
youth of genius who has nothing to conceal from 
his mistress, and whose pen paints with delicate 
fidelity the fluctuating emotions of the lover's heart. 
The volume is a tasteful one outwardly, and con- 
tains some interesting portraits. 






So far as our observation goes, the 
anada. ave . ra g e well-read citizen of the 

United States the word American 
will not serve in this case knows less of the his- 
tory of our political neighbor on the North since 



the times of which Parkman treats, and of her 
development, than he knows of any important 
country of Europe or Asia. Yet the history of 
Canada is related to our own at many points, and 
is full of interest for this reason as well as interest- 
ing in itself. Hence the latest addition to the ex- 
cellent " Cambridge Historical Series " (Macmillan) 
commands attention for its theme, " Canada, 1760 
1900," as well as for its excellence. The author 
is Sir John G. Bourinot, a scholar and writer of 
reputation, and probably the highest authority on 
Canadian history. He first gives a sketch of the 
French Regime, then takes up the settlement of the 
several parts of the country, then the development 
of representative institutions. This last forms a 
most interesting story, complicated as it was with 
the race jealousies of French and English, religious 
differences, provincial rivalries, and the ideas and 
prejudices inherited on the one side from fugitive 
Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies, and on the 
other from the French absolutism of the Old Regime. 
The author gives another side of the history of the 
American Revolution and of the War of 1812 from 
that presented by our own writers. He gives the 
Canadian view of Samuel Adams as agitator and 
conspirator, and of the insufficiency and pettiness 
of the causes alleged for our separation from En- 
gland ; of the puerility of our management of the 
War of 1812 ; and, in the last chapter, of Canada's 
relations with the United States, in orderly survey 
from 1783 to 1900, boundaries, fisheries, trade, in- 
cluding the questions now in dispute between the 
countries. We give our hearty commendation of 
the book as an interesting story of political develop- 
ment, as casting side-lights on our own history, and 
as a valuable reference book. 

The collecting of book-plates (qua 
book-plates) is said to have begun in 
1820 with a Miss Jenkins of Bath, 
England. Her collection, seventeen years later, 
furnished the nucleus of what has since become 
one of the largest in England. The literature of 
the subject began in France in 1874, and in En- 
gland six years later ; and has been increased since 
then in England, France, Germany, and America, 
by numerous volumes and a flood of periodical con- 
tributions. At the present time, the interest taken 
in these sometimes artistic bits of paper is undoubt- 
edly widespread and steadily increasing. To the 
periodical literature of the subject, Mr. W. G. 
Bowdoin has been a frequent, persistent, and pro- 
lific contributor. He is therefore well qualified to 
inform the public about book-plates, but his " Rise 
of the Book-Plate " (Wessels) does not give us as 
much historical knowledge of the subject as we 
might be led to expect, though it is precisely the 
kind of book the collector of ex libris will find in- 
dispensable. It contains an Introduction and a 
paper on " The Study and Arrangement of Book- 
Plates " by Mr. Henry Blackwell, a veteran collec- 
tor; two essays by Mr. Bowdoin, in defense of 



1901.]

collecting and in "exemplification of the art"; a 
page of names of American book-plate designers ; 
a bibliography and lists of contributors to American 
and English book-plate literature; and a list of 
book-plate inscriptions not nearly as full as it 
might be made without risk of becoming tiresome. 
The remaining pages are devoted to fac-similes of 
more than two hundred German, Austrian, Belgian, 
Italian, Arabic, Welsh, French, English, Canadian, 
and American book-plates, showing the extent of 
Mr. Bowdoin's collection and the immense diversity 
of styles employed in the production of a book- 
plate. Unfortunately, a great number of Mr. Bow- 
doin's examples suffer by being reproduced in 
miniature. 

If the annual output of works on 
" etiquette " were any criterion, the 

American carries the national quality 
of common-sense into his personal behavior to a 
very slight extent. In another aspect, such a work 
as Miss Emily Holt's " Encyclopaedia of Etiquette " 
(McClure, Phillips & Co.) is an indication of the 
national longing for the best, and its sub-titles, 
"What to Write, What to Wear, What to Do, 
What to Say," and " A Book of Manners for Every- 
day Use," are only expressions of that democracy 
which believes itself to be as good as anybody or 
anything, and needs nothing more than the telling 
to put it into demonstration. Yet it is manifest 
that any person certain of his breeding can not 
possibly require such a volume ; and no less certain 
that a person without breeding cannot be given it 
by a library full of similar works. It must, there- 
fore, be intended for that large class, like Mahomet's 
coffin in respect of heaven and earth, which is 
neither in nor out of good society or at least is 
not in bad society. Every social plane has its own 
conventions, and these are the birthright of all 
born within its domain. What Miss Holt has 
undertaken to do is to show what those people in 
Europe who believe themselves to be better than 
the common herd do when they have money enough, 
and, by a parity of reasoning, what Americans 
should do when they come into a fortune sufficient 
to warrant their breaking into a class of equal 
wealth previously acquired. If they trust to her 
book they will not go very far wrong, and if they 
do not none will discover it unless they happen to 
read the same book. 

The reputation already established 
south Carolina b Mr Edward McCrady, a member 

in the Revolution. J _, ', 7 _, ,. 

of the Charleston, South Carolina, 
bar, in his two volumes on the early history of his 
State, is not likely to be diminished in his new 
" History of South Carolina in the Revolution " 
(Macmillan). The first part of the book is an ex- 
cellent description of the rise and growth of the 
civil revolution in the Palmetto State. It does 
justice to Drayton, Gadsden, Laurens, the Rut- 
ledges, and many others, whose work in the good 
cause has long been overshadowed by that of pa- 



triots in the northern colonies where chroniclers 
and newspapers more abounded. The author makes 
no attempt to shield or explain away the early un- 
popularity of the patriot cause, and the frequent 
dissensions of its constituents. As the later years 
of the war proper approach, and the tide of battle 
turns toward South Carolina, the author finds him- 
self encumbered with a mass of tactical detail and 
campaign minutiae which makes three-fourths of his 
book a military history. At last, after almost nine 
hundred pages, he stops abruptly at the close of the 
year 1780 with the statement that another volume 
will be necessary to complete the subject. This 
might better have been stated clearly upon the title 
page. There is no attempt to laud unduly the 
achievements of South Carolina, or detract from 
those of the other States. The facts are presented 
with the directness of the lawyer. The references 
are not voluminous but are well chosen. The sub- 
ject matter is illustrated by a number of plans of 

battles. 

If the Rev. John M. Bacon had 
written his book "By Land and 
Sky" (Lippincott) with a view to 
converting his fellow-men to ballooning, he could 
not have manifested more enthusiasm, nor set forth 
the joys he has experienced high above the earth 
more eloquently. It is a book which can be read 
for pure pleasure, uncontaminated by any selfish 
and few mundane considerations. It contains many 
accounts of the fearless author's voyages in the 
clouds, in times of sun and moon, of calm and 
storm, and all of them made thrilling by the cer- 
tainty that coming to earth is a vastly more com- 
plicated and exciting business than sailing away 
from it. There are four excellent pictures, and a 
general avoidance of technicalities and statistics 
such as might weary the general reader. At the 
same time there is an abundance of well-distributed 
information and pertinent observation. If any one 
is hesitating between staying on the ground or as- 
cending to the skies, Mr. Bacon's book can be relied 
upon to decide him in favor of ascent. 

If interest in an author and the 
probable permanence of that interest 
may in a measure be understood 
from the number of books written about him, we 
may safely conclude that Robert Louis Stevenson 
is fairly secure in the present and prospective re- 
gard of the lovers of books. Within less than a 
twelve-month two volumes dealing with his life and 
work have come to our table, besides another some- 
what ambitious volume giving considerable space 
to the discussion of his art. The latest study of 
Stevenson, by Mr. H. Bellyse Baildon, is the 
work of an old schoolmate of Stevenson's, and 
therefore displays a delightfully intimate acquaint- 
ance with the man in his relation to the product 
of his pen. The book does not make pretense 
to the dignity of a well-rounded biography, but 
it traces the development of the delicate sensitive

boy into the artist with the closeness of insight 
of a man who knew and loved his dead friend 
well, and who knows and loves books. And the 
fact that they were " chums " together in an Edin- 
burgh school has not lessened Mr. Baildon's critical 
acumen and made him a blind hero- worshipper. 
As severe upon Stevenson's faults as the case war- 
rants, he does not stop with the criticism of them, 
but goes on to a discussion of them as a part of the 
strangely rich and complex personality of the au- 
thor. The especial merit of the book, aside from 
the engaging ease of the style, is perhaps the care- 
ful and penetrating sureness of this analysis. All 
in all, the volume is illuminating and helpful, and 
certainly it is enjoyable. The bibliography at the 
end contains a long list of books and articles about 
Stevenson, but there should be place for this one 
also. (Wessels.) 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

A delightful little book in a number of ways is the 
recent reprint of James Puckle's " The Club; or, a Grey 
Cap for a Green Head," issued in this country by 
Messrs. Truslove, Hanson & Comba. To the book 
itself, an eighteenth-century collection of " moral max- 
ims," little more than an antiquarian interest attaches. 
The chief concern of the book-lover of to-day with 
Puckle's " Club " lies in the series of designs made for 
the edition of 1817 by James Thurston, and cut on 
wood by some of the foremost engravers of the time. 
These beautiful examples of an art now almost extinct 
are carefully reproduced in the present reprint, and 
together with Mr. Austin Dobson's sparkling introduc- 
tion and the handsome typography of the Chiswick 
Press make it a volume to be coveted. 

The great literary activity of the Rev. Sabine Baring- 
Gould is bound to show itself in carelessness of style 
and negligence in presenting facts. His " Virgin Saints 
and Martyrs" (Crowell) shows these unpleasant quali- 
ties, quite as much as the wide and curious erudition 
which is the author's. The main part of the book is 
drawn from the sixteen- volume "Lives of the Saints" 
which was completed in 1898, with the later pages de- 
voted to that self-sacrificing Englishwoman, Dorothy 
Wyndlow Pattison, to whom Mr. Baring-Gould accords 
the honors of beatification or sanctification on his own 
initiative, under the name of Sister Dora. Many illus- 
trations embellish the present book, most of them ex- 
cellent wood-cuts after famous paintings. 

The following German and French text-books are 
the latest to appear upon our table: Frey tag's " Soil 
und Haben " (Heath), greatly condensed, and edited 
by Dr. George T. Files ; Herr von Wildenbruch's 
" Harold" (Heath), edited by Dr. Charles A. Eggert; 
Storm's " Immensee " (Ann Arbor: Geo. Wahr), edited 
by Messrs. Hildner and Diekhoff ; Schiller's " Wallen- 
stein " (Macmillan), edited by Dr. Max Winkler; 
" Constructive Process for Learning German " (Jenk- 
ins), by Dr. Adolphe Dreyspring; "Coaur de Noel" 
(San Francisco: Robertson), by Sig. L. D. Ventura; 
" Le Tour de la France par Deux Enfants " (Heath), 
by M. G. Bruno, edited by Dr. C. Fontaine; and "The 
French Subjunctive Mood " (Heath), by Mr. Charles C. 
Clarke, Jr. 



NOTES. 



Mr. Frederic Harrison's Harvard address on " The 
Writings of King Alfred " is now published in pamphlet 
form by the Macmillan Co. 

Mr. David McKay has just published a new edition, 
prepared by the Rev. J. Loughran Scott, of Bulfinch's 
ever-popular " Age of Chivalry." 

" Edward Carpenter, Poet and Prophet," is the title 
of a pamphlet by Mr. Ernest Crosby, just published at 
the office of the Philadelphia " Conservator." 

" A Reading Book in Irish History," by Dr. P. W. 
Joyce, is a publication of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & 
Co. It is written for children in and out of school. 

Don Antonio Gil y Zdrate's play of "Guzman el 
Bueno," edited by Dr. Sylvester Primer, is a modern 
language text just published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

A revised and enlarged edition for 1901 of " Lee's 
Automobile Annual," the standard reference work on 
the subject, has just been issued by Messrs. Laird & Lee. 

" Stevensoniana " still come from time to time to our 
desk. The latest volume, of varied contents, both textual 
and pictorial, is published by Mr. M. F. Mansfield at 
the Bankside Press. 

Miss Lucy Maynard Salmon's " Domestic Service " 
has gone into a second edition, to which has been added 
a chapter on domestic service in Europe. The Mac- 
millan Co. are the publishers. 

An intimate study of the life and writings of Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, by Mr. John Albee, will be published 
at once by Robert G. Cooke of New York, under the 
title " Remembrances of Emerson." 

" An Introduction to the Industrial and Social His- 
tory of England," by Professor Edward P. Cheyney, is 
published by the Macmillan Co. It is intended for use 
as a text-book in secondary schools and colleges. 

The Princeton Press send us an edition of " The 
Elegies of Maximianus," prepared by Mr. Richard 
Webster, and containing, besides a newly-collated text, 
an introduction and an elaborate critical commentary. 

" The Christian in Hungarian Romance," being a 
study of Dr. Maurus Jokai's novel " There is a God ; 
or, The People Who Love but Once," by Mr. John 
Fretwell, is announced for immediate publication by 
the James H. West Co. of Boston. 

"Beowulf" and "The Fight at Finnsburg," trans- 
lated into English by Dr. John R. Clark Hall, and 
provided with much critical and explanatory apparatus 
(pictures included), is a recent English publication 
supplied in this country by the Macmillan Co. 

" Selections from the Poetry of Alexander Pope," 
edited by Dr. Edward Bliss Reed, and Burke's " Speech 
on Conciliation with America," edited by Mr. Daniel V. 
Thompson, are the latest additions to the series of 
" English Readings " published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. 

An important collection of English books and pictures 
will be sold at auction by Williams, Barker & Severn 
Co., Chicago, on the 20th and 21st of this month. The 
sale includes a number of rare first editions of Dickens, 
Thackeray, Scott, Tennyson, Carlyle, and other English 
authors. 

In view of the approaching Alfred the Great millen- 
nial celebration, the two latest additions to the Old 
South Leaflets are particularly timely and interesting. 
They consist of the description of Europe which formed

the first chapter in King Alfred's translation of Orosius, 
and the account of Augustine in England taken from 
Alfred's version of the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical 
History of the English Nation. 

Messrs. Cassell & Co. publish an " Encyclopedia of 
the Game of Whist," by Sir William Cusack-Smith. 
It is a booklet of vest pocket size, and the topics are 
arranged alphabetically. Its doctrine is modern and 
commendable, save for the author's unaccountable preju- 
dice against the " call for trumps " and the " echo." 

The Cambridge University Press has just published, 
and sent to us through the Messrs. Macmillan, two 
small books, one of which contains Professor R. C. 
Jebb's brilliant Cambridge lecture of last summer on 
Macaulay, and the other of which contains " Two 
Lectures Introductory to the Study of Poetry," by the 
Rev. H. C. Beeching. 

" The Romance Cycle of Charlemagne and His 
Peers," by Miss Jessie L. Weston, is No. 10 in Mr. 
David Nutt's pamphlet series of " Popular Studies in 
Mythology, Romance, and Folklore." Another series, 
just started by Mr. Nutt, is entitled "The Ancient 
East," and has for its first issue " The Realms of the 
Egyptian Dead," by Dr. K. A. Wiedemann. 

An important arrangement has just been completed 
whereby George M. Hill Company of Chicago become 
for a term of years the sole publishers of Webster's 
"Unabridged Dictionary," the copyright of which is 
owned by G. & C. Merriam Company, the original pub- 
lishers. A heavy reduction in the price of the work is 
one of the innovations contemplated. 

The series of " Masters in Art," published by the 
Bates & Guild Co. of Boston, represents an excellent 
idea intelligently carried out. Each of the monthly 
issues is devoted to one of the world's great painters or 
sculptors. The contents comprise ten reproductions in 
half-tone of the artist's most representative productions, 
an accurate short account of his life, opinions on his 
work selected from the world's best critics, and a bib- 
liography and list of paintings. The illustrations are 
wonderfully good examples of the half-tone process, 
and the entire make-up of the little magazine is artistic 
and attractive. 

Mr. Francis P. Harper sends us " The Literary Year- 
book and Bookman's Directory for 1901," edited by 
Mr. Herbert Morrah. This is an English work, and, 
as such, does not appeal directly to the interests of 
American readers. It contains, however, much matter 
of general interest, and will not be found without its 
use for reference in this country. A portrait of the 
late Bishop of London is given for a frontispiece, and 
the text includes a directory of authors, another of 
publishers, still another of booksellers, and much mis- 
cellaneous matter upon such subjects as copyright, 
periodicals, the drama, and literary societies. 

A " History of the Christian Religion to the Year 
Two Hundred," by Judge Charles B. Waite of Chicago, 
is a work first published about twenty years ago. It 
has gone through several editions, and the one now be- 
fore us (the fifth) has had the benefit of a complete 
revision, owing to the fact that the original plates were 
destroyed, which made it possible to rewrite the work 
much more thoroughly than would otherwise have been 
the case. The work has had a considerable popular 
vogue, but the author's critical equipment does not 
seem to be altogether adequate to his task. Messrs. 
C. V. Waite & Co , Chicago, are the publishers.

Balzac's Rival 



Balzac had no rival but George 
Sand; some critics consider them 
twin stars. 

This woman, acknowledged by all the world 
as the second, if not the first, of French nov- 
elists, was certainly the most remarkable 
woman of her age, and the greatest authoress 
in the world's history. 

The story of her own life is as romantic and 
eventful as that of any of her heroines ; the 
revelations made in her Histoire de ma vie 
would furnish material for a dozen novels of 
the present day. An interesting pamphlet 
giving outline of her life will be sent on request.

LAKE FRENCH READINGS 

Under the supervision of 

EDOUARD P. BAILLOT Northwestern University 
Evanston, 111. 

THE PURPOSE of this series of books is to supply reading material for the latter part of 
the first year and the early part of the second year of the students' work in French. While 
the books, therefore, are easy reading, each one has a distinct place in the study of the language. 
To this end, introductions and notes are explanatory and suggestive, and each of the volumes 
is provided with a vocabulary. 

The books are bound in brown cloth with back and side stamp, and are very attractive 
volumes for the student's library. Price, 50 cents each. 

This selection of plays will be found simple enough for 
early reading, and will hold the interest of beginners. The 
book will give the student some acquaintance with the kind 
of literature in which the language is rich. It contains 
"LA GRAMMAIRE," by Eugene Labiche, "LA JOIE 
FAIT PEUR," by Madame Emile de Girardin, and " LES 
DOIGTS DE FEE," by Eugene Scribe, all of which are standard. 

Many teachers of French find that their students do not 
understand and appreciate the works which they are called 
upon to read, because of their ignorance of the most ordinary 
facts of French History. How and when to give this neces- 
sary information has become a problem everywhere, and it is 
to aid in the solution of this problem that the present book has 
been published. The style of the book is so simple that it may be put into the hands of pupils 
as soon as they have acquired a knowledge of the principal irregular verbs. The text is mainly 
that of a little book used in the schools of France with some rearrangement and additions. 
Each chapter is followed by a series of questions to bring out the facts of the chapter by way 
of conversational review. The book contains a map of France. 

The book contains nine short stories by Guy de Maupassant, 
Ludovic Halevy, Alexandre Dumas fils, Henry Lavedan, and 
Paul Margueritte. These authors are among the foremost of 
the second half of the nineteenth century. Such a collection 
of stories will acquaint the student with many sides and char- 
acteristics of French life, as well as with the thought of a large

COMPREHENSIVE SCHOLARLY INTERESTING 

A History of the American People 

By FRANCIS NEWTON THORPE, Ph.D., 

Author of " A Constitutional History of the American People," " The Constitutional History 

of the United States," etc. 

An enjoyable work for busy men and women, as well as the best compendium of Ameri- 
can history for the student that has yet appeared. Professor Thorpe's name is familiar to 
every student of history as the author of a number of exhaustive, scholarly works, as well 
as through his work as a lecturer on history. This new book, however, is of much more 
general interest than any that he has yet written, for it fills a gap in our literature which the 
late Moses Coit Tyler pointed out the need for a one- volume history of our country which 
is at once exact in scholarship and readable as literature.

FOUR STRIKING NEW NOVELS 



Gissing's Our Friend the Charlatan 

386 pp., 12mo, S1.50. 

Such of Mr. Gissing's many friends as have seen the 
manuscript of this new novel find it the strong work they 
have been expecting at his hands, because of evident ability, 
steady improvement, and constant respect for his art. The 
motive is the one now popular of the politician and the 
woman, but it is treated in ways that are the author's own. 



Marnan's Daughter of the Veldt 

350 pp., 12mo, 51.50. 

A novel giving a vivid picture of life in the Transvaal 
before the War. Perhaps its most conspicuous feature 
is its " strenuousness." The author makes the Veldt 
itself share the honors with its daughter, and shows 
how it instills much of its own wildness into those who 
dwell upon it .

The "Lady"' of the title is the sister of an unjustly 
persecuted French army officer. An Englishman, the 
hero of the story, arrives on the scene, and, after much

strong love interest. It is dedicated to Captain Dreyfus.

1 lie iTidtmuidn company CHURCHILL'S New Novel 

THE CRISIS '4 

"RICHARD CARVEL," the author says, was written as the first of a series of novels which, while in no 
sense sequels or interrelated in any way, have a distinct historical sequence as pictures of American life at different 
periods. In that book we followed the character of the Cavalier, both in the colonial society of Maryland and 
the fashionable life of London prior to and during the early days of the American Revolution. 

The scenes of " THE CRISIS " are laid in St. Louis, nearly a century Liter. The heroine of the story, 
Virginia Carvel, a great-granddaughter of Richard Carvel, serves to connect the stories in interest. The hero, 
Stephen Brice, is a young New England lawyer seeking fortune in the Southern city. 

Among the many characters in the historical setting of the story we meet Grant, a poor farmer, later the 
greatest general in the army ; Sherman, president of a small street car line, later also a conspicuous and pic- 
turesque figure in the history of his time ; and Lincoln, a struggling country lawyer, later as President in our 
greatest national crisis. 

To all who followed the fortunes of Richard Carvel, this charming romance of his great- 
granddaughter should be filled with interest. She sustains most gracefully the family traditions, 
and in her we can see a nobler, finer Dorothy Manners of the 19th century. 

Aside from the narrative, Mr. Churchill has given, with rare skill, a picture of the typical 
reserved New England gentleman, " fed from within with all the strength he needs," as 
opposed to the haughty, brave aristocrat of the South at the time of the Civil War. His pic- 
tures of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman are graphic, as may be noted by the following extracts 
from letters of Stephen Brice to his mother 

THE CRISIS 

Of LINCOLN. 

" When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre, towering figure in black. He wears a 
scraggy beard now. But the sad smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice all were just the same. 
I stopped when I looked upon the face. It was sad and lined when I had known it, but now all the agony endured 
by the millions, North and South, seemed written on it. 

" < Do n't yon remember me, Major? ' he asked. The wonder that he had remembered me! I took his big, 
bony hand, which reminded me of Judge Whipple's. Yes, it was just as if I had been with him always, and he 
were still the gaunt country lawyer." 

Of GRANT. 

" When the General had finished reading the dispatches, he folded them quickly and put them in his pocket. 

" ' Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major,' he said. I talked with him for about half 
an hour. I should rather say talked to him. He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect. I believe that 
he only opened his lips to ask two questions. Yon may well believe that they were worth the asking, and that 
they revealed an intimate knowledge of our march from Savannah. I was interrupted many times by the arrival 
of different generals, aides, etc. He sat there smoking, imperturbable. Sometimes he said ' yes ' or < no,' but 
oftener he merely nodded his head. Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who 
floundered. The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he had in hand." 

Of SHERMAN. 

" I think his simplicity his most remarkable trait. You should see him as he rides through the army, an 
erect figure, with his clothes all angular and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes. 
Yon can hear his name running from file to file ; and sometimes the new regiments can 't resist cheering. He 
generally says to the Colonel: 'Stop that noise, sir. Don't like it.'" 

The great popularity of " Richard Carvel," 375,000 copies of this novel having been sold, 
has led the publishers to print 100,000 copies for the first edition of " The Crisis." The indi- 
cations are that the first orders will consume the entire stock. 

The book has eight charming Illustrations by HOWARD CHANDLER CHRISTY. 
In size and style it is uniform with " Richard Carvel," being 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50.

PRESCIENT PHILANTHROPY. 

Philanthropy in the form of charity, in the 
form of immediate succor for the suffering and 
relief for the needy, is doubtless as old as 
human pity itself. When all due credit is 
given to the benevolence of the motives that 
have inspired this sort of philanthropy, all the 
way from individual almsgiving to the estab- 
lishment of great eleemosynary institutions, the 
sorrowful fact remains that the history of such 
endeavor is in large measure a history of mis- 
placed sympathy, of injudicious sacrifice, of the 
application of remedies that do not reach the 
root of the evil sought to be combated. The 
scientific study of such matters as poor-law 
relief, the endowment of hospitals and asylums, 
and the collective efforts of communities to 
deal with the conditions of temporary distress, 
brings clearly into prominence the fact that 
the best of intentions in these directions are 
likely to do an amount of indirect harm suf- 
ficient to counteract all the direct good result- 
ing from them. What these well-meant philan- 
thropies do in the way of pauperizing their 
objects, in the way of undermining individual 
resolution and sapping the sturdiness of indi- 
vidual character, must be taken into account 
no less than the temporary alleviations with 
which they are to be credited. The sum of 
immediate human suffering is so great at all 
times, and its evidences so apparent, that it is 
difficult for the tender-hearted observer to re- 
main philosophical in its presence, yet we are 
morally bound to hesitate in coming to its re- 
lief , if by so doing we are helping to perpetuate 
the conditions which give it birth. That this 
danger is a real one is a conclusion now so 
well-established by sociological investigation 
as to be beyond the reach of controversy. 

It is, then, with feelings of mingled satis- 
faction and disapproval that the sociologist 
must view the strengthening of old charities 
and the multiplication of new ones by the do- 
nations and the bequests of which we read 
from day to day. It is hard to look such gift 
horses in the mouth, for the benefactors by 
whom they are offered are actuated by the 
most generous of motives, and a vital human

sympathy, even if misdirected or injudiciously 
applied, deserves generous responsive recog- 
nition. But the clear-sighted lover of his 
fellows will, on the whole, welcome a new 
educational foundation, or any other new en- 
dowment that tends to minister to the spiritual 
rather than the physical needs of men, with a 
gratitude more unreserved than that with which 
he can welcome the more common manifesta- 
tions of the philanthropic spirit. The one is 
sure to remain a blessing for all time to come ; 
the other may quite possibly, and in the long 
run, accentuate the very sort of distress which 
it seeks to relieve. However admirable may 
be the philanthropy that vents itself upon 
hunger, and nakedness, and disease, it is a still 
more admirable philanthropy that concerns 
itself with the future of the race, and that has 
for its aim the intellectual and ethical advance- 
ment of the coming generations. 

This prescient form of philanthropy is com- 
ing to be far more characteristic of large givers 
than it has been in the past, and the fact is a 
cause for congratulation. It seems as though 
wealthy men were just beginning to realize the 
possibilities for good in the endowment of edu- 
cation and scientific research, of literature and 
art. In the field of education alone, the op- 
portunities offered for the wise use of wealth 
are practically unlimited. The resources of 
public taxation can never be really adequate 
for the work of public education. Speaking 
in Chicago a year or two ago, President Eliot 
referred to the public schools of the city, with 
their two hundred and fifty thousand pupils, 
and said that they should have a teacher for 
every ten children, or fifty thousand teachers 
in place of the five thousand that they actually 
do have. The suggestion was a startling one, 
yet not unreasonable. Obviously, this amount 
of teaching can never be provided by the tax- 
payers, and thus there is almost unlimited scope 
for private philanthropic activity in connection 
with the public schools alone. The endowment 
of technical and university education has been 
unprecedently generous during the past score 
of years, yet all that has been done in this 
direction should be considered but an earnest 
of what may and must be done in the future. 
There is no other form of investment that pays 
such dividends as an educational institution or 
system social dividends of intelligence and 
civic usefulness and heightened public morality. 

A form of educational philanthropy that is 
coming more and more into vogue of late is 
that which stimulates reluctant givers to co- 



operate in the work of educating the youth of 
the growing generation. The gifts of such men 
as Mr. Carnegie, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. 
Pearsons are wisely conditioned upon the rais- 
ing of large additional sums from other sources. 
Dollar for dollar is the rule with these men, 
or, as in the case of Mr. Carnegie's library 
benefactions, public provision of ten per cent 
annually upon the original gift. This is an 
admirable plan, for it doubles, or more than 
doubles, the power of the giver for good, while 
it also attaches to the acceptance of an endow- 
ment a certain measure of responsibility which 
cannot fail to bring forth fruit in careful ad- 
ministration and widespread interest in the 
institutions concerned. This responsibility 
sometimes assumes such proportions as in 
the case of Mr. Carnegie's munificent endow- 
ment of the Scotch universities that the gift 
is viewed askance, and accepted with a grudg- 
ing sort of gratitude. It is very amusing to 
read some of the English and Scotch comment 
upon this superb benefaction. We are told 
that university tuition without the means of 
subsistence is a mockery, and the influx of 
large numbers of students will compel the 
Scotch universities to enlarge their teaching 
facilities at the public charge. It does not 
seem to be realized that the very purpose of 
the gift is to stimulate private endeavor in 
sending young men to the universities, and 
public endeavor in enlarging the universities 
in accordance with the highest conception of 
national duty. To carp at such a gift on the 
ground of the responsibilities which it entails 
is an act unworthy of a high-spirited people. 
Such protestants should remain silent for very 
shame, and seek rather, by every means in their 
power, to encourage the nation to rise to the 
height of this great occasion. 



THE Historical Manuscript Commission, appointed a 
few years since by the American Historical Association, 
has called fresh attention to its labors of love in its 
fourth report, being a collection of some five hundred 
letters written by John C. Calhoun, and over two hun- 
dred letters written to him. These letters were col- 
lected by the Commission from all parts of the Union, 
the search occupying several years. They embrace 
both public and private correspondence, showing the 
great Carolinian both as a statesman and as a family 
man. The volume, issued by the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion as a government publication, at last makes Calhoun 
as well known as Franklin, Washington, John Adams, 
and John Quincy Adams, and others have been known 
by their collected correspondence. No attempt has been 
made to conceal anything, or to emendate or edit, and 
very wisely, the editor has refrained from comments.

THE POETRY OF MR. MOODY.* 

Every two or three years, from some quarter 
of the critical horizon, there issue trumpetings 
of praise which herald the advent of a new 
singer of songs. A bright star has swum into 
the ken of some watcher upon the battlements, 
and the discovery is proclaimed to the world 
with much pomp of rhetorical eulogy. The 
number of new poets who have thus been dis- 
covered during the past quarter-century is 
considerable, but most of them have shared 
the fate of the novce known to astronomers, and 
their magnitude has rapidly become dimmed. 
We have often envied the enthusiasm that 
could find so much to praise in these new inter- 
preters of nature and human life, but have felt 
ourselves sorrowfully compelled to stand out- 
side the chorus, and to mar its harmonies by 
the injection of certain discordant notes of 
caution and temperate restraint. A book of 
poetry must exhibit very great qualities indeed 
to constitute an event in literature, or to set 
its writer among the enduring poets of his age. 
In the memory of men now in their middle or 
advancing years there have been only two such 
events in English poetry the appearance of 
Mr. Swinburne's " Poems and Ballads " in 
1866 and of the " Poems " of Rossetti in 1870. 
Tested by these touchstones, " The Love Son- 
nets of Proteus " and " The City of Dreadful 
Night," the books of Mr. Watson and Mr. 
Kipling and Mr. Phillips, have been phenom- 
ena of only secondary significance. Yet the 
writers of all these books, and other writers as 
well, have been hailed as new luminaries of 
the first rank, have been praised in terms that 
one would hesitate to apply to Arnold or Ten- 
nyson, and have been made, as far as indis- 
criminate eulogy could make them, the literary 
fashion of their respective hours. Praiseworthy 
they doubtless are, but not worthy of the sort 
of praise that has been injudiciously bestowed 
upon them to the confusion of all absolute 
values. 

In making the following somewhat extended 
comment upon the poetical work of Mr. 
William Vaughn Moody, we are not going to 
say that he is a poet of the highest kind of 



*THE MASQUE OF JUDGMENT. A Masque-Drama in Five 
Acts and a Prelude. By William Vaughn Moody. Boston :

Mifflin & Co. 



accomplishment, or apply to him the language 
that must properly be reserved for poets whose 
work has stood the test of time and remained 
un corroded by it. But we are going to say 
and by our exhibits seek to prove that no 
other new poet of the past score of years, either 
in America or in England, has displayed a 
finer promise upon the occasion of his first 
appearance, or has been deserving of more 
respectful consideration. There is no reason, 
for example, why his work should attract less 
attention than has been given of late to the 
work of Mr. Stephen Phillips, and we make 
not the slightest doubt that, had his work been 
the product of an Englishman, its author would 
have been accorded the resounding praise that 
has been accorded to the author of " Marpessa " 
and " Paolo and Francesca." We wish to say, 
furthermore, that we have not for many years 
been so strongly tempted to cast aside critical 
restraints and indulge in " the noble pleasure 
of praising," after the fashion, let us say, of 
the late Mr. Hutton when dealing with the 
poetry of Mr. William Watson. Nor do we 
hesitate to add that, with the possible exception 
of what has been done by Professor Wood- 
berry, no such note of high and serious song 
has been sounded in our recent American 
poetry as is now sounded in " The Masque of 
Judgment " and the " Poems " of Mr. Moody. 
" The Masque of Judgment " is a work that 
labors under extraordinary difficulties. The 
form itself is one that a writer must be greatly 
daring to attempt, and the substance is of a 
sort that heightens the difficulties of the form. 
Like the epics of Dante and Milton, it is con- 
cerned with no less a theme than the cosmog- 
ony ; like " Faust," it sets speech upon the 
lips of archangels ; like the " Prometheus Un- 
bound," it personifies the creations of mythol- 
ogy. It might more fittingly be styled a 
Mystery than a Masque, but it cannot take an 
easy refuge in the naivetes of medievalism, 
for it is no imitative exercise in archaism, but 
a poem conceived in the spirit of modern 
philosophy. So true is this that we are im- 
pelled to provide it with texts from the writings 
of the philosophers. Professor Royce says : 
"It is the fate of life to be restless, capricious, 
and therefore tragic. Happiness comes, in- 
deed, but by all sorts of accidents ; and it flies 
as it comes. One thing only that is greater 
than this fate endures in us if we are wise of 
heart ; and this one thing endures forever in 
the heart of the great World-Spirit of whose 
wisdom ours is but a fragmentary reflection.

[June 1, 



This one thing, as I hold, is the eternal resolu- 
tion that if the world will be tragic, it shall 
still, in Satan's despite, be spiritual. And this 
resolution is, I think, the very essence of the 
Spirit's own eternal joy." And Professor 
James, writing in much the same spirit, says : 
" God himself, in short, may draw vital strength 
and increase of very being from our fidelity. 
For my own part, I do not know what the 
sweat and blood and tragedy of this life mean, 
if they mean anything short of this." On the 
lips of Mr. Moody 's Raphael, the archangel ic 
lover of mankind, this philosophy is given 
melodious utterance. 

" Darkly, but oh, for good, for good, 
The spirit infinite 

Was throned upon the perishable blood ; 
To moan and to be abject at the neap, 
To ride portentous on the shrieking scud 
Of the aroused flood, 

And halcyon hours to preen and prate in the boon 
Tropical afternoon. 

" Not in vain, not in vain, 
The spirit hath its sanguine stain. 
And from its senses five doth peer 
As a fawn from the green windows of a wood ; 
Slave of the panic woodland fear, 
Boon- fellow in the game of blood and lust 
That fills with tragic mirth the woodland year ; 
Searched with starry agonies 
Through the breast and through the reins, 
Maddened and led by lone moon-wandering cries. 
Dust unto dust complains, 
Dust langheth out to dust, 
Sod unto sod moves fellowship, 
And the soul utters, as she must, 
Her meanings with a loose and carnal lip ; 
But deep in her ambiguous eyes 
Forever shine and slip 
Quenchless expectancies, 
And in a far-off day she seems to put her trust." 

Again, and in still clearer language, the arch- 
angel declares the glory of man's passionate 
self-contradictions : 

" I have walked 

The rings of planets where strange-colored moons 
Hung thick as dew, in ocean orchards feared 
The glaucous tremble of the living boughs 
Whose fruit hath life and purpose ; but nowhere 
Found any law but this : Passion is power, 
And, kindly tempered, saves. All things declare 
Struggle hath deeper peace than sleep can bring : 
The restlessness that put creation forth 
Impure and violent, held holier calm 
Than that Nirvana whence it wakened Him." 

Thus the way is prepared for the Divine 
Tragedy. God, having created the race of 
men, and having sought to save man from him- 
self by the mystery of the Incarnation, deter- 
mines at last to destroy the impious brood. 

"What if they rendered up their wills to His ? 
Hushed and subdued their personality ? 
Became as members of the living tree ? " 

To Raphael, thus musing, the Angel of the 
Pale Horse makes reply : 



"A whisper grows, various from tongue to tongue, 
That so He will attempt. Those who consent 
To render up their clamorous wills to Him, 
To merge their fretful being in His peace 
He will accept : the rest He will destroy." 

In the fulness of time, the Day of Judgment 
dawns, and " God's vengeance is full wrought " 
upon the wicked. The following wonderful 
lyric is sung by the redeemed spirits on their 
upward flight : 

" In the wilds of life astray, 
Held far from our delight, 
Following the cloud by day 
And the fire by night, 
Came we a desert way. 
O Lord, with apples feed us, 
With flagons stay ! 
By Thy still waters lead us ! 

" As bird torn from the breast 
Of mother-cherishings. 
Far from the swaying nest 
Dies for the mother wings, 
So did the birth-hour wrest 
From Thy sweet will and word 
Our souls distressed. 
Open Thy breast, thou Bird I " 

Yet Raphael, who alone of the celestial hosts 
has understood the heart of man, and whose 
imagination has foreshadowed the consequences 
of his destruction, remains disconsolate. 

"Never again ! never again for me ! 
Never again the lily souls that live 
Along the margin of the streams, shall grow 
More candid at my coming. Never more 
God's birds above the bearers of the Ark 
Shall make a wood of implicated wings, 
Swept by the wind of slow ecstatic song. 
Thy youths shall hold their summer cenacles ; 
I am not of their fellowship, it seems. 
God's ancient peace shall feed them, as it feeds 
These yet uplifted hills. I would I knew 
Where bubbled that insistent spring. To drink 
Deep, and forget what I have seen to-day." 

But the destruction of mankind is only the 
beginning of the Tragedy. When that awful 
fiat went forth, God likewise accomplished His 
own doom. To be dethroned and destroyed by 
the forces of His own creation is the fate that 
awaits Him, as it awaited the God of Scandi- 
navian myth in the day of Ragnarok, as it 
awaited the God of Greek myth in Shelley's 
treatment of the tale of Prometheus. The 
instrument of His undoing is the Worm that 
Dieth not, His own monstrous miscreation, 
who, having swept mankind from the face of 
earth at the behest of his Creator, mounts up- 
ward to commit violent assault upon the hosts 
of Heaven. 

" He mounts ! 

He lays his length upward the visioned hills, 
The inviolable fundaments of Heaven ! 
There where he climbs the kindled slopes growjpale, 
Ashen the amethystine dells, and dim 
The starry reaches."

The closing scene between the Spirits of the 
Lamps about the Throne, who have fled in 
terror from the terrific struggle, and the Arch- 
angels Raphael and Uriel, rises to a height of 
imaginative sublimity that leaves us fairly 
stricken with awe. 

"URIEL ( approaching). 
The dream is done ! Petal by petal falls 
The coronal of ereat ured bloom God wove 
To deck His brows at dawn. 

RAPHAEL. 

No hope remains ? 
URIEL. 

To save Him from Himself not cherubim 
Nor seraphim avail. Who loves not life 
Receiveth not life's gifts at any hand. 

RAPHAEL. 

Would He had dared 

To nerve each member of His mighty frame 
Man, beast, and tree, and all the shapes of will 
That dream their darling ends in clod and star 
To everlasting conflict, wringing peace 
From straggle, and from straggle peace again, 
Higher and sweeter and more passionate 
With every danger passed ! Would He had spared 
That dark Antagonist whose enmity 
Gave Him reioicing sinews, for of Him 
His foe was flesh of flesh and bone of bone. 
With suicidal hand He smote him down, 
And now indeed His lethal pangs begin. 

FIRST LAMP (to Uriel). 
Brother, what lies beyond this trouble ? Death ? 

URIEL. 
All live in Him, with Him shall all things die. 

SECOND LAMP. 
And the snake reign, coiled on the holy hill? 

URIEL. 
Sorrow dies with the heart it feeds upon. 

RAPHAEL. 

Look, where the red volcano of the fight 
Hath burst, and down the violated hills 
Pours ruin and repulse, a thousand streams 
Choked with the pomp and furniture of Heaven. 
In vain the Lion ramps against the tide. 
In! vain from slope to slope the giant Wraths 
Rally but to be broken. Dwindling dim 
Across the blackened pampas of the wind 
The routed Horses flee with hoof and wing,: 
Till their trine light is one, and now is quenched. 1

Put off their substance of ethereal fire 
And mourn phantasmal on the phantom Alps.

And thou sweet trembling opal ye are grown

My wick burns blue and dim. 

SECOND LAMP.

The stars arise with lifted hands, and wait." 



We have endeavored to give, in the preced- 
ing analysis, some idea of the fashion in which 
Mr. Moody has dealt with his grandiose con- 
ception of the Creation, the Christian Mystery, 
and the Judgment. He has shown it possible 
to make in our own day a very noble poem, as 
Milton did, out of the Biblical Mythology, and 
as Shelley did, out of the most subtle spiritual 
symbolism. The poem is not without minor 
faults, and criticism of the microscopic sort 
might easily detect flaws here and there, words 
inaccurately used or inadequate as vehicles of 
their intention, forced imagery and moments 
of flagging imagination. We are content to 
leave to others this thankless task, feeling that 
the superb merits of the work make its occas- 
ional crudities quite insignificant. We have 
quoted many of its finest passages, but have 
reserved for the last the finest of them all 
this glorious apostrophe to mankind : 

" O Dreamer ! O Desirer ! Goer down 
Unto nntravelled seas in untried ships ! 
O crusher of the nnimagined grape 
On uneonceived lips ! 
O player upon a lordly instrument 
No man or god hath had in mind to invent ; 
O cunning how to shape 
Effulgent Heaven and scoop out bitter Hell 
From the little shine and saltness of a tear ; 
Sieger and harrier, 

Beyond the moon, of thine own bnilded town, 
Each morning won, each eve impregnable, 
Each noon evanished sheer ! " 

We should not know where in recent poetry to 
look for the match to this melodious and sym- 
pathetic portrayal of " life's wild and various 
bloom " of passion and aspiration, of alter- 
nating defeat and victory, of the commingling 
of sense and spirit that makes of our existence 
so confused a web of self-contradictions, yet 
somehow suggests a harmony of design that 
must be apparent to the transcendental vision. 
It is clear that the poet of " The Masque of 
Judgment " is no partisan of the ascetic ideal. 
His plea is for the richness of life, for the 
legitimate claims of sense no less than of 
spirit, for the working out of one's salvation 
by means that leave no human instinct athirst. 
Nor is his ideal one for the few favored by 
nature or circumstance ; it is rather the all- 
embracing expression of a fine trust in the 
whole of human nature. This democratic out- 
look, which is somewhat obscured by the sym- 
bolism demanded for the dramatic work we 
have just had under discussion, is given a more 
definite expression in the volume of the 
" Poems," to which we now turn. We find it 
in " Gloucester Moors," with which the book 
opens, a striking poem which likens the earth 



368

[June 1, 



to a ship bound with its freight of souls for 
some unknown port. 

" But thou, vast outbound ship of souls, 
What harbor town for thee ? 
What shapes, when thy arriving tolls, 
Shall crowd the banks to see ? 
Shall all the happy shipmates then 
Stand singing brotherly ? 
Or shall a haggard ruthless few 
Warp her over and bring her to, 
While the many broken souls of men 
Fester down in the slaver's pen, 
And nothing to say or do ? " 

It takes a robust optimism to bear up under 
the spectacle afforded by the darker aspects of 
human life, its physical failings and its spiritual 
agonies, and the mood of " A Grey Day " 
holds the poet under its obsession more than 
once. 

"I wonder how that merchant's crew 
Have ever found the will ! 
I wonder what the fishers do 
To keep them toiling still ! 
I wonder how the heart of man 
Has patience to live out its span, 
Or wait until its dreams come true." 

But this mood is not lasting, nor does it in- 
sistently prevail in the writer's consciousness. 
Whatever the defeats life may bring, the strong 
spirit will not be cowed, nor will it seek a 
refuge in quietism. Some stanzas written " At 
Assisi " give us a clear statement of the poet's 
philosophy. 

" I turn away from the gray church pile ; 
I dare not enter, thus undone : 
Here in the roadside grass awhile 
I will lie and watch for the sun. 
Too purged of earth's good glee and strife, 
Too drained of the honied lusts of life, 
Was the peace these old saints won ! 

"St. Francis sleeps upon his hill, 
And a poppy flower laughs down his creed ; 
Triumphant light her petals spill, 
His shrines are dim indeed. 
Men build and build, but the soul of man, 
Coming with haughty eyes to scan, 
Feels richer, wilder need. 

" How long, old builder Time, wilt bide 
Till at thy thrilling word 
Life's crimson pride shall have to bride 
The spirit's white accord, 
Within that gate of good estate 
Which thou must build us soon or late, 
Hoar workman of the Lord? " 

There is not a poem among the score or 
more contained in Mr. Moody's volume that 
is commonplace or devoid of some arresting 
quality of imagery or emotion. Regretfully 
passing by the greater number of them we 
reserve our remaining space for the two pieces 
inspired by the dark page of recent American 
history. Our broken national faith, our lust 
of dominion, the subordination of morality to 
greed in our international dealings, and our 



desertion of the principles upon which our 
greatness as a people has hitherto been based, 
these are things that have made the last two 
years a period of inexpressible sadness to 
Americans who have been taught to cherish 
the teachings of Washington and Jefferson, of 
Sumner and Lincoln. How we have longed 
for the indignant words of protest that our 
Whittier or our Emerson or our Lowell would 
have voiced had their lives reached down to 
this unhappy time! But in reading Mr. 
Moody's " Ode in Time of Hesitation " and 
his lines " On a Soldier Fallen in the Philip- 
pines " we are almost consoled for the silence 
of the prophet- voices that appealed so power- 
fully to the moral consciousness of the gene- 
ration before our own. We seem to catch the 
very accent of Lowell's patriotic fervor in these 
lines suggested by the Shaw Memorial : 

"Crouched in the sea-fog on the moaning sand 
All night he lay, speaking some simple word 
From hour to hour to the slow minds that heard, 
Holding each poor life gently in his hand 
And breathing on the base rejected clay 
Till each dark face shone mystical and grand 
Against the breaking day ; 
And lo, the shard the potter cast away 
Was grown a fiery chalice crystal-fine 
Fulfilled of the divine 

Great wine of battle wrath by God's ring-finger stirred. 
Then upward, where the shadowy bastion loomed 
Huge on the mountain in the wet sea light, 
Whence now, and now, infernal flowerage bloomed, 
Bloomed, burst, and scattered down its deadly seed, 
They swept, and died like freemen on the height, 
Like freemen, and like men of noble breed." 

Contrast this bright picture of heroic devotion 
to a great cause with the dark picture presented 
by the successors of these men now engaged in 
the bloody subjugation of an alien people who 
have done naught to offend us, and whose crime 
is that they love their country well enough to 
die by thousands for its sake. 

" I will not and I dare not yet believe ! 
Though furtively the sunlight seems to grieve, 
And the spring-laden breeze 
Out of the gladdening west is sinister 
With sounds of nameless battle over seas ; 
Though when we turn and question in suspense 
If these things be indeed after these ways, 
And what things are to follow after these, 
Our fluent men of place and consequence 
Fumble and fill their mouths with hollow phrase, 
Or for the end-all of deep arguments 
Intone their dull commercial liturgies 
I dare not yet believe ! My ears are shut ! 
I will not hear the thin satiric praise 
And muffled laughter of our enemies, 
Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword 
Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd 
Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian's hut 
Showing how wise it is to cast away 
The symbols of our spiritual sway, 
That so our hands with better ease 
May wield the driver's whip and grasp the jailer's keys."

By the memory of the fine altruistic impulse 
that stirred our national heart when the suf- 
fering Cubans besought us for aid, let it not 
be said of us that a mean motive underlay that 
frank outburst of active sympathy, that our 
protestations of unselfishness were the merest 
hypocrisy, and that our soldiers have given up 
their lives that their country might be dis- 
honored. 

" We charge yon, ye who lead us, 
Breathe on their chivalry no hint of stain ! 
Torn not their new-world victories to gain ! 
One least leaf plucked for chaffer from the bays 
Of their dear praise, 

One jot of their pore conquest put to hire, 
The implacable republic will require. 

For save we let the island men go free. 

Those baffled and dislaarelled ghosts 

Will curse us from the lamentable coasts 

Where walk the frustrate dead. 

The cup of trembling shall be drained quite. 

Eaten the sour bread of astonishment, 

With ashes of the hearth shall be made white 

Oar hair, and wailing shall be in the tent." 

This impressive adjuration is supplemented by 
the lines suggested by the death of General 
Lawton. 

" A. flag for the soldier's bier 
Who dies that his land may live ; 
O, banners, banners here, 
That we doubt not nor misgive ! 
That he heed not from the tomb 
The evil days draw near 
When the nation, robed in gloom. 
With its faithless past shall strive. 
Let him never dream that his ballet's scream went wide of 

its island mark, 

Home to the bean of his darling land where she stumbled 
and sinned in the dark." 

When our nation shall have won back its 
sanity, and once more learned to heed al- 
though at what cost we tremble to think 
the lessons of righteousness taught us by the 
Fathers of the Republic, these poems will seem 
as stars seen through the angry cloud-rifts of 
a tempestuous night, bearing shining witness 
to the fact that in our hour of darkness there 
were some souls that held the faith undaunted 
by all the powers of evil leagued against them. 
We are somehow reminded of an eloquent simi- 
litude employed by the late Frederic Myers. 
Speaking of the judgment of the men to come 
upon still another poet who, like Mr. Moody, 
would not despair of a seemingly hopeless 
cause, he said : " They will look back on him 
as Romans looked back on that unshaken 
Roman who purchased at its full price the 
field of Cannae, on which at that hour victorious 
Hannibal lay encamped with his Carthaginian

Cox's WAR REMINISCENCES.* 

The two handsome volumes of " Military 
Reminiscences " of the late Major-General 
Jacob Dolson Cox form a very valuable con- 
tribution to the literature of the Civil War. 
The author was a scholar to begin with, and 
was always a student. During many years 
preceding his death he had wide experience as 
a critic, often reviewing books on the Civil 
War period, noting what was omitted by 
others, what was said in extravagant statement, 
what took the form of positive misconception 
of facts. Uniting in himself the education 
requisite to just judgment, the experience of a 
general in actual campaign work, and the 
special training afforded by his later life, he 
was fitted as few could be to produce, a gen- 
eration after the war, a story regarding it of 
the greatest interest and importance. 

The worth of his production is enhanced 
because, as General Cox was not one of the 
greatest officers developed by the war, atten- 
tion to the personality of the man does not 
obscure the details of his story, and conse- 
quently the two volumes are a very valuable 
source of information on questions relating to 
that trying time, and not alone a showing of 
the achievements of a single individual, as, 
unfortunately, has been the case with many 
volumes of memoirs published during the last 
decade. 

| The military career of General Cox was 
largely devoted to the campaigns in West Vir- 
ginia, in East Tennessee, and with Sherman on 
his famous " March to the Sea." There was, 
indeed, a digression for awhile to Antietam, 
with a resulting account of the battle there 
which might possibly lead to criticism, but the 
early return to West Virginia from the army 
in the East would seem to make this rather an 

| episode in the man's military life than an 
organic part of it. 

Without noting particularly the details which 
are presented in connection with the occupa- 
tion of East Tennessee and the march through 
Georgia, the campaign in West Virginia may 

; be taken to furnish abundant material for an 
appreciation of the General's conception of 
warfare. Nowhere else is there such a clear 
account of the operations in the new mountain 
State, which, turning to freedom, broke away 
from the Old Dominion and entered the Union

as a separate commonwealth. Occupying a 
place on the border line between the tide-water 
regions south of the Potomac and the great 
Central West, the possession of West Virginia 
had a two-fold importance. As a political 
measure it was essential that there should be 
an early massing of the army of the Union to 
sustain the people in their determination to 
stand by the country as against the champions 
of slavery, and when so many Americans were 
turning away from their allegiance, justice re- 
quired that if support were needed it should 
be given heartily to the friends of freedom. 
$ |From a military standpoint the State was 
even more important. It was the gateway 
from Ohio to Virginia, and therefore absolutely 
essential to the successful operations of the 
Union forces. Because of the rough and rugged 
nature of the soil there were only a few routes 
by which an army could march across the 
State. These routes might easily have been 
defended with comparatively small expense, 
but as a matter of fact much outlay was re- 
quired to secure them. 

The early movements in West Virginia had 
a great deal to do with shaping the general 
conduct of the war, because it was owing to the 
brilliancy of achievements there that General 
McClellan was called to be head of the armies. 
Those chapters which discuss McClellan have 
much interest, and the estimate made by Mr. 
Rhodes and Mr. Schouler in their histories of 
the period are fully sustained by the statements 
from General Cox. 

But, after all, the lessons learned from a 
study of the campaign in West Virginia involv- 
ing a great many problems of warfare, such 
as, for example, the handling of raw recruits, 
the dealing with newspaper men, some of them 
not particularly scrupulous in their methods or 
careful of the interests of their country, the 
peculiar conditions of life due to the isolation 
of the people, the irregular guerilla fighting on 
both sides, do not impress one as so import- 
ant as the general information in the volumes 
on topics such as the " Vallandigham Case," 
"Morgan's Raid," " The Knights of the Golden 
Circle," the plot to liberate prisoners at John- 
son's Island, etc. 

A striking feature of General Cox's Memoirs 
is the comparison in quality of the volunteers 
and the regulars, or of the volunteer officers 
and those who had the benefit of West Point 
training. One gets a pretty definite notion 
that the members of the regular army rather 
suffered by comparison with the volunteers, 



who came from every walk in life because of 
devotion to the cause of the Union, and fought 
for flag and country from sentiment rather 
than from the necessity of military discipline. 
As Mr. Cox puts it, " A bold heart and a cool 
head and practical common-sense were of much 
more importance than anything taught at 
school," and these characteristics were often 
displayed in most striking manner by the vol- 
unteers right at the start, a brief experience in 
warfare making them notably prominent. 

In discussions such as these, the volumes are 
strong, General Cox's special training and his 
student instincts lending much weight to his 
carefully worded opinions. There is a vein of 
quiet humor throughout, many of the anec- 
dotes and incidents of army life being related 
in a very interesting way. Even the apparently 
trivial may be of value, if correctly interpreted, 
as, for example, the shrill cry " Glory to God " 
from a woman spectator of the scenes in the 
Ohio Senate when it was announced that Fort 
Sumter was being attacked. " It was the voice 
of a radical friend of the slave, who after a 
lifetime of public agitation believed that only 
through blood could freedom be won." The 
last few chapters are given up to the move- 
ments against Johnston by Sherman's army, 
and the history of the end of the war in the 
Carolinas and Georgia is presented in detail 
and in so satisfactory a way that these pages 
will be often consulted for this particular part 
of the story of the Civil War.

HAZLITT'S VENETIAN REPUBLIC.* 



Throughout a long lifetime, Mr. W. Carew 
Hazlitt has been a devoted lover of Venice and 
things Venetian. At the age of twenty- three 
he formed the idea of writing a history of the 
island state, and his first sketch appeared in 
1858. This was revised and expanded two 
years later into a " History of the Venetian 
Republic " in four volumes, which, their author 
now tells us, " undoubtedly left their precursors 
far behind in merit and completeness, but were 
still excessively far, looking at them to-day, 
from realizing what such a work ought to have 
been." In the forty years that have since 
elapsed, the author's writings have dealt with 
other themes, but he has still read and accumu-

lated notes on Venice ; and " the fruit of a 
rather slow and tedious process of concentrat- 
ing on this particular object an endless amount 
of reading and thought is manifest in the work 
now submitted with diffident satisfaction to the 
English-speaking public, which may here meet 
with the means of instituting many comparisons 
between our own modern practices and opinions 
and those previously entertained and carried 
out at Venice, and may more thoroughly realize 
to what an extent the Republic was our pilot 
and our instructor." 

In its final form, the history fills two hand- 
somely printed volumes of eight hundred pages 
each, and constitutes the most ambitious at- 
tempt yet made to present the history of Venice 
to English readers. The narrative, which in 
the edition of 1860 stopped with the death of 
the Doge Foscari in 1457, is now brought 
down to the extinction of the republic in 1797, 
while the account of political and social life 
which then occupied but two chapters now fills 
twenty-five. 

Substantially half of the present work is 
new, and has profited by the new material con- 
tained in the " Calendar of Venetian State 
Papers," the later volumes of Komanin's "Storia 
Documentata," and various recent publications 
on Venetian antiquities. In the first volume, 
however, the indebtedness to recent investi- 
gations is very slight. This portion of the 
work has been to a considerable extent re- 
written, and the form of expression has been 
considerably improved ; but if the style is that 
of maturer years, the scholarship is stiH in all 
essential respects that of 1860, and by no means 
the best of its day. The author seems to ap- 
preciate the importance of new information on 
the later period of Venetian history, for he 
speaks of the " Calendar of State Papers " as 
reducing " to waste-paper the entire corpus of 
old-fashioned literature, produced from time 
to time in Italy itself and elsewhere, on the 
history and constitution of the Republic "; but 
he seems to be ignorant that the same kind of 
work has been going on, though less obtrusively, 
in the mediaeval field. If the amount of really 
new material on the earlier period is less abun- 
dant, it is at least considerable ; and the 
active investigations of the last forty years, 
especially in Germany, have thrown new light 
on almost every phase of the history of me- 
diaeval Italy and its relations with the other 
peoples of its time. Upon Mr. Hazlitt this 
steady accumulation of special studies and 
monographs seems to have had no effect, as 



regards either his information or his methods. 
There is the same easy and haphazard use of 
chroniclers, the same lack of critical discern- 
ment. We find the same shadowy account of 
the beginnings of Venice, the same vagueness 
as to its relations to the Eastern and Western 
Empires, the same absence of that sound 
knowledge of the general history of Italy and 
Europe which is essential for a satisfactory 
treatment of so many-sided a theme. It is 
true that Charlemagne is no longer called " the 
French emperor," but it is a doubtful improve- 
ment to make the Venetians the descendants 
of " the warlike Northmen " (p. 27). The con- 
quests of the Lombards are still said to have 
been divided according to " the prevailing sys- 
tem of feuds " (p. 14). Michaud and Sismondi 
are still the chief authorities for the Crusades, 
and Lebeau still does duty for the Byzantine 
empire, which is described in the cheap and 
easy fashion so common before its history began 
to be seriously studied. We read (p. 54) of 
" the sterile annals of the reign of the Doge 
Tradenigo," although it is now known that it 
was his policy which freed Venice from Byzan- 
tine control. Again and again, in Volume I., 
one finds the survival of outgrown views and 
the reliance upon antiquated authorities. 

In the second volume the quality of the 
narrative improves. It is plain that the author 
is no longer struggling under the weight of an 
old book ; he has reached a fresh field, and 
writes with greater ease and freedom. His 
investigations are not thorough or exhaustive, 
but he gives a truer impression of modern 
Venice, and there is greater unity in style and 
treatment. Undoubtedly the most interesting 
chapters are the last, where, having conducted 
the republic through its declining days to its 
suppression by Napoleon, the author enters 
upon an extended account of Venetian life. 
Everything is here canals and squares, 
churches and palaces, the constitution and the 
laws, industry and commerce, art and letters, 
food and drink and amusements, all that the 
traveller may wish to know of the life of the 
Venice of an older day is set forth in this 
gossippy compendium of Venetian lore. Very 
interesting it all is, but loose and ill- arranged 
and undigested. These chapters evidently 
represent the result of years of note-taking, 
but the mark of the scrapbook is still fresh 
upon them. After all, they are not history, 
nor since the sources from which the infor- 
mation is derived are usually left unnoted 
are they materials for history.

This defect, in greater or less degree, per- 
vades the whole work. Put together at different 
times out of all sorts of materials, it lacks unity 
and flow. The style is labored and heavy, with 
a tendency to inflated assertion, as when we 
are told that, " There is no other spot on the 
earth where, within a radius of a hundred 
miles, or, if we limit the calculation to the 
metropolis itself, an infinitely smaller compass, 
so large a share of the world's business has 
been directly or indirectly transacted." The 
fact is that Mr. Hazlitt is neither a trained 
historian nor an attractive writer, and in mat- 
ter and manner his history falls below the 
standard of what one has a right to expect of 
so pretentious a publication. It contains a 
large amount of interesting material, but it 
lacks the literary qualities which might make 
it popular, while it does not show the extensive 
research, the familiarity with recent investiga- 
tions, and the critical judgment, which are 
essential to a scholarly work of reference.

PARISH HISTORY EXTRAORDINARY.* 

More than two years ago, when the first vol- 
ume of the History of Trinity Church, New 
York, made its appearance and was briefly 
noticed in the columns of THE DIAL, its value 
as a contribution to more than mere local, 
parochial, or denominational history was recog- 
nized, and a fuller notice was reserved until 
the work was farther advanced. The second 
volume is now before us, and a third is in 
course of preparation which is to bring the 
work down to the year 1862, the beginning of 
the rectorate of the editor of the volumes. 

The history of an American parish which 
can be made to extend to three octavo volumes 
averaging more than four hundred pages each, 
without resorting to all sorts of " padding," is 
altogether unique. But Trinity Church is 
altogether unique among American parishes. 
It is one of the oldest corporations in the coun- 
try, existing under a charter dated May 6, 
1697. Its history proper goes back to 1674, 
when the Province of New Amsterdam was 
ceded to the British, for there were at that 
time a number of members of the Church of

England in America holding services in a little 
chapel near the Battery which had been pre- 
viously occupied by the Hollanders. The year 
after the charter, the first church was opened 
for services upon a parcel of land obtained by 
royal grant " in or near to a street without the 
North gate of the city, commonly called Broad- 
way," a site since occupied by two other struc- 
tures, one built in 1788, and the other begun 
in 1839, the present " Old Trinity," as it is 
affectionately called by New Yorkers, and one 
of the finest specimens of Gothic architecture 
in this country. 

In 1705 the Church became the possessor in 
fee simple of sixty-two acres of land on Man- 
hattan Island, extending along the Hudson 
River from Vesey Street to Christopher Street. 
It had formerly been the property of Aneke 
Jans Bogardus, was sold after her death to 
Governor Lovelace, and, as his property, had 
been confiscated by the crown in 1674, hence 
it was sometimes called " Queen Anne's Farm." 
Since the Revolutionary War, as the city has 
grown and values have increased therein, this 
property has been the source of wealth to 
Trinity Church. It has been the occasion of 
great responsibility as well, and it is the public- 
spirited manner, in the broadest use of the 
term, in which this great responsibility has 
been administered, that justifies in part the 
publication of this parish history upon its pres- 
ent gigantic scale. The benefactions of Trinity 
Church have been lavishly distributed for the 
establishment of churches, and for the succor 
of those already established in parts of the city 
where they were most needed. 

Naturally the possession of so much valuable 
property has caused Trinity parish to be re- 
garded as Naboth of old was in the possession 
of his vineyard. No one having a drop of 
Aneke Jans's blood in his veins but felt that 
there was a possibility of establishing some 
sort of a claim to a participation in the income 
of the property that once was hers. Not a 
small portion of the volumes before us is de- 
voted to a refutation of the popular " delusion " 
that Trinity Church is unlawfully possessed of 
and unjustly retains property belonging to 
someone else. But ever since 1705, Trinity 
Church has been administering her estates to 
the greater benefit of the community than the 
same estates would have yielded in the hands 
of private individuals. All of her revenue- 
producing property pays taxes (to the amount 
of $63,000 in 1885), and her property rev- 
enues (amounting in 1885 to a little less than

half a million) are expended for the religious, 
charitable, and educational advantage of the 
commonwealth, by maintaining the Christian 
religion, furnishing the means of a good edu- 
cation, comforting and succoring the sick, 
relieving the needy, cultivating the taste of the 
people by the refining influences of music, 
architecture, and beautiful worship, and thus 
promoting the best interests of society and 
contributing toward the security and perma- 
nence of our common civilization. The main- 
tenance of " Old Trinity " and her seven chapels 
with a communicant list of about seven thou- 
sand and a staff of clergy numbering twenty- 
five ; the maintenance of a system of parish 
schools, industrial schools, choir schools, and 
Sunday schools ; aid regularly given to eccle- 
siastical and educational institutions outside of 
the city ; the support of hospitals and infirm- 
aries, all these indicate the uses which Trin- 
ity Church makes of her income, and faintly 
implies the potency of the Parish as a factor 
in the civic life of New York. 

Trinity has been the mother of churches in 
New York City and elsewhere. Until recently, 
although without the name or the honor, she 
has stood in the position, done the work, and 
furnished the example, of the Cathedral of the 
Diocese of New York. After the close of the 
Revolutionary War and the organization of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church in this country, 
Bishops Provoost, Moore, and Hobart were 
Rectors of Trinity Church while serving in 
succession as Bishops of New York. Bishops 
Onderdonk and Wainwright were assistant 
ministers of Trinity when elected to the Epis- 
copate of the same diocese. The Church has 
furnished from her staff of clergy bishops for 
other dioceses. The Rector of Trinity during 
the Revolutionary War was subsequently made 
Bishop of Nova Scotia. 

Nor are these all the reasons Trinity has to 
offer for setting forth her history on such a 
gigantic scale. In the pre-Revolutionary and 
Revolutionary periods, covered in the first vol- 
ume, her history is the history of New York, 
both the city and the province, so that it is 
impossible to tell the one without also telling 
the other. How closely interwoven is Trinity 
Parish with the early history of New York 
City may be seen by observing the street 
nomenclature of the lower part of the city. 
There are Church Street and a Chapel Street ; 
a Vesey and a Barclay Street, named after 
Rectors of Trinity ; while Bayard, Chambers, 
Charlton, Clarkson, Delancey, Desbrosses, 



Duane, Harrison, Howard, Lispenard, Lodge, 
Ludlow, Morris, Reade, Varick, White, and 
Willett Streets were named after men and 
families who were prominent in the history of 
the parish. 

The first volume does more than draw upon 
the commonly accepted authorities for a setting 
and background for the ecclesiastical narrative. 
The editor exhibits his independent character 
as a historian, and is able, in more than one 
instance, to correct errors which have been 
made and perpetuated in the history of the 
city and province. The second volume contains 
more that is of the nature of parochial annals 
than the first, and bears a closer relation to 
the history of the Church which was at that 
time in process of organization in America. 
But like the first, it presents many excerpts 
from records and from local newspapers which 
give us an occasional insight into the customs 
and manners of the people in the American 
metropolis as it grew into importance in the 
early years of the nineteenth century. 

It remains to be said that the books are 
published in a style to delight the eye of the 
bibliophile and are illustrated with photogra- 
vure portraits, fac-similes of important docu- 
ments, and views of the buildings which 
constitute Trinity Parish.

COLONIZATION IN ALL AGES.* 

Mr. Henry C. Morris's " History of Coloni- 
zation " is in two volumes. Part I., in five 
chapters, deals with ancient Colonies. Part 
II., in four chapters, is devoted to the middle 
ages. Part III., in twenty-eight chapters, re- 
lates to modern times. Six chapters are given 
to Portuguese and Spanish Colonies, three to 
Dutch, six to French, eleven (including nearly 
all of the second volume) to English, with a 
chapter on minor colonization, and one in con- 
clusion. 

The plan, it will be seen, is an extensive 
one, covering the whole world and all recorded 
time. This is a large undertaking, and implies 
for its adequate execution many years' famil- 
iarity with the subject and a vast amount of 
research. It relates to one of the most mo- 
mentous world-movements with which history

of completion. To draw together the innumer- 
able scattered threads so as to weave a whole 
out of what may appear utterly isolated and 
confused ; to realize clearly that Da Gama and 
Columbus and Frobisher and Raleigh and Clive 
and Livingstone and Stanley are, after all, 
workers at the same gigantic task ; to show in 
luminous outline how that task has been 
wrought by many hands and in many climes 
until amid tumult and travail we may now see 
it approaching full realization, this is a task 
for one of the greatest historians of all the ages. 
Perhaps no one will be able to perform it until 
the twentieth century too is gone, and the 
whole can be understood in the light of the 
conclusion. 

Mr. Morris has gathered much valuable 
material relating to modern colonies and their 
political and economic conditions. To be sure, 
these conditions are undergoing continual 
change, and facts and figures need incessant 
revision in order not to be misleading at any 
given time. Still, it is very convenient to find 
in one place such matter as may be found in 
these two volumes. Perhaps in so small com- 
pass it would be difficult to avoid treating 
some things in very general terms, as, for in- 
stance, in dealing with British West Africa 
(II. 239, ff). One could perhaps wish that 
the narrative depended less on cyclopaedias (as 
evidenced inter alia by citations in footnotes, 
e. g,, pp. 245-54), and more on documents at 
first hand. The scholar of history, too, will 
hardly regard the historical treatment as satis- 
factory. The author is evidently more at home 
in dealing with descriptive analysis than in 
treating history. 

The bibliography is extensive, but of com- 
paratively little value because uncritical. A 
critical bibliography would in itself be an ex- 
cellent contribution to- scholarship on this most 
important subject. Such an undertaking would 
require a vast amount of labor and very deli- 
cate discrimination. But if it could be treated 
with the patient research and scholarly acumen 
which mark such a monumental work as Gross's 
" Bibliography of Mediaeval Municipalities," 
for instance, we should in time have at hand 
an indispensable guide for all students. The 
mass of literature dealing with colonial subjects 
is enormous. Official reports, correspondence, 
and acts of legislation, are of vast bulk. There 
are innumerable books of travel, of very differ- 
ent purposes and value many of them sadly 
padded. There are biographies and histories 
of all sorts, some mere ephemeral partisan effu- 



sions, some the hasty and superficial work of 
newspaper correspondents, some the serious 
productions of competent scholars. There are 
the discussions of many special subjects, geo- 
graphical, ethnological, economic. An enum- 
eration of some of these, such as is found in 
Mr. Morris's book or in the " Statesman's Year 
Book," for example, is somewhat convenient. 
A critical compilation of all of them would be 
of incalculable value.

Miss TARBELL'S NAPOLEOX. * 



Several years ago, when the tide of interest 
in Napoleon was running at full flood, Miss 
Ida M. Tarbell contributed a serial Life of 
Napoleon to the third and fourth volumes of 
" McClure's Magazine." In 1895, on its com- 
pletion as a serial, it was published in book 
form, profusely illustrated by a series of por- 
traits from the collection of Mr. Gardner G. 
Hubbard ; and the handsome volume before 
us is the second edition of this book, " with 
illustrations selected from those in the first." 
These pictures, now as then, constitute a series 
of " personal documents " which surpass in 
interest the fluent and entertaining narrative 
of familiar things in which they are set. Every 
stage of that eventful career, from Brienne to 
St. Helena, is suggested by these likenesses of 
the best-known figure in modern history. 

As to the text, it may be said that Miss 
Tarbell has an alert eye for the picturesque, 
and a trained instinct for selecting and group- 
ing impressive scenes ; and these gifts had 
full course in the pages of a popular magazine 
at the time of flood referred to. Now that it 
is really more than a century since Napoleon 
made his appearance as the man of action in 
Paris streets, and we are no longer suffused 
with the centennial enthusiasm, these 

" Res gestse regumque ducumque et tristia bella " 

will be as they have been before estimated 
more coolly. Miss Tarbell is a bit of a hero- 
worshipper, and takes a steadily favorable view 
of all of her hero's acts and most of his motives. 
Her account of the " punishment " of the Due 
d' Enghien and the " acquisition " of the art 
treasures of Italy, together with her omission 
of such tragedies as the shooting of the two 
thousand prisoners at Jaffa, suggest an attitude

of mind toward Napoleon hardly assumed by 
any American writer since Mr. J. S. C. Abbott. 
In her summary, indeed, she admits his limi- 
tations and contradictions (p. 294): " He was 
the greatest genius of his time, perhaps of all 
time ; yet he lacked the crown of greatness 
that high wisdom born of reflection and intro- 
spection which knows its own powers and limi- 
tations, and never abuses them ; that fine sense 
of proportion which holds the rights of others 
in the same solemn reverence it demands for 
its own." This is true ; but it is not shown 
by the story of his life as Miss Tarbell tells it. 
A much more impartial estimate is the very 
interesting sketch of the Empress Josephine, 
added as new material to the present edition. 
Miss Tarbell sums up, fairly and kindly, the 
defects and amiable qualities of the Creole 
girl who became for a while the virtual Empress 
of Europe, when she says (p. 452), " A candid 
survey of her life destroys the heroine, but it 
leaves a woman who through a stormy life 
kept a kindly heart toward friend and enemy 
and who at last attained rectitude of conduct." 
The book is made useful as well as entertain- 
ing by a table of the Bonaparte family, a 
chronological table, and a good index.

a plain, sailorlike way, in the neatly-made volume 
entitled "A Sailor's Log" fAppleton). The title 
of the book fairly indicates its quality both of style 
and matter. There is no attempt at fine writing, 
everything being set down substantially as it hap- 
pened, with business-like brevity, as if the narrator 
were drawing up an account of himself and his 
professional services for the information of his offi- 
cial superiors. There is plenty of life and color, 
however, and a good deal of rough humor seasoned 
occasionally with expressions of the forcible sort 
that at one time brought down upon " Fighting 
Bob " the publicly expressed disapproval of a sec- 
tion of the clergy. Certain critics of the present 
volume have been carping at the author for blowing 
his own trumpet therein somewhat loudly, and it 
must be owned he shows no disposition to deliber- 
ately make light of his adventures. And why should 
he ? A parade of modesty is almost as bad as 
braggadocio, and Rear-Admiral Evans, a frank 
man if ever there was one, steers bis own normal 
course midway between these offensive extremes. 
He does not boast, nor does he angle for compli- 



ments with the old, old bait of self-depreciation. 
He tells his story as he remembers it, and if it is 
on tbe whole creditable to himself, well and good. 
Tbe book is cast in autobiographical form, and it 
begins at the beginning, namely, with the writer's 
childhood in Virginia, where at six he was, as he 
pleasurabl y remembers, tbe proud owner of ' a gun, 
a pony, and a negro boy " locally indispensable 
chattels, all three. In the opening chapters, life in 
old Virginia and an early trip to the West are 
pleasantly sketched, followed by an account of the 
author's cadetehip at Annapolis. The main narra- 
tive begins with the account of the author's services 
in the Civil War, and then follows tbe diversified 
story of cruises to the Orient, to Africa, to South 
America, to Bebring Sea, to the Baltic, and so on. 
An interesting episode tells of the Kiel celebration, 
which the author attended as commander of the 
cruiser " New York." The volume closes with a 
lively resum6 of the naval operations of the Spanish- 
American war. There are fourteen illustrations. 



Gilbert 1 * 



** 8e ldom that we find a more 
of interesting and concise autobiograph- 
j cal 8 k etcn t h an The Stage Remi- 
niscences of Mrs. Gilbert" (Scribner). The book 
traces the life of a woman who has held a highly 
honored place in American theatrical history for 
over half a century ; the theatre-going public needs 
no introduction to that sterling actress and estimable 
woman, Mrs. Anne Hartley Gilbert. For many 
years her friends have enjoyed listening to her de- 
lightful flow of reminiscence and anecdote ; it has 
been a real sorrow to many of them that so much 
of interest should live only in their memories, and 
they have often urged the writing of such a book 
as the one under consideration. " But why?" she 
would invariably answer. " I 've been so long be- 
fore the public that everybody knows all about me. 
Besides, I am not at all interesting, just by myself. 
I have always said that actresses and actors, who 
are good for anything, give the very best of them- 
selves to their audiences when on the stage. The 
private life doesn 't count." But her friends' ad- 
vice prevailed, and the book has been given us. 
From it we learn that Mrs. Gilbert was born in 
England in Rochdale, Lancashire, not far from 
Manchester. She came to America in 1849, and 
always called herself a "forty-niner." In 1869 
she joined the theatrical forces of Augnstin Daly, 
witb whom she was associated until his death in 
1899. The account of her first days in this country, 
which were spent in the West, then crude and wild, 
are sad and even pathetic. Her first stopping- 
place was Milwaukee, after a visit to a settlement 
on the edge of the wilderness, in which Mr. Gilbert 
had invested and lost all their little fortune. They 
were glad to accept positions in a local theatre at 
an extremely low salary. In 1851 they went to 
Chicago, travelling in winter by open wagon, and 
obliged to bind themselves in blankets to keep from 
freezing. The hardships and the forgotten dramas

of those pioneer days are a strong contrast to the 
later period of her life when the most palatial hotels 
were none too sumptuous. In these fascinating 
pages, Mrs. Gilbert has given us peeps behind the 
scenes and glimpses into the personality of many 
famous persons in the annals of the American stage. 
The volume, edited by Miss Charlotte M. Martin, 
is written with a straightforwardness, a propriety, 
good sense, grace and force of diction, which cause 
one to lay it aside with feelings of deep regret that 
it is not more lengthy. Many rare photographs, in 
the possession of the author and of Mr. Evert Jan- 
sen Wendell, have been appropriately utilized in 

the illustration. 

Two books resulting from the war 
Between Great Britain and her colo- 
nies and the two little Republics of 
South Africa have been published, dealing with 
incidental rather than historical aspects of the 
struggle. The first of these, " Blue Shirt and 
Khaki" (Silver, Burdett & Co.), is from the hand 
of Mr. James F. J. Archibald, an American war 
correspondent who saw both the Cuban and South 
African campaigns. His recital makes a powerful 
appeal to our national vanity, chiefly by suppressing 
the disagreeable side of the Cuban campaign and 
the amazing imbecilities shown there, while bring- 
ing into strong relief the other amazing imbecilities 
manifested in South Africa. There is undoubted 
justice in the strictures passed on the British 
army, the methods of which were far less suited to 
the campaign it had in hand than those of the 
Indian-fighting Americans ; but it is regrettable 
that so able a writer as Mr. Archibald should fall 
into the ranks of those who conceive American 
greatness to be helped by the suppression of Ameri- 
can faults. The other book, "War's Brighter 
Side " ( Appleton), is edited by Mr. Julian Ralph, 
and consists chiefly of extracts from " The Friend," 
a field newspaper published in Bloemfontein after 
the British occupancy, under the patronage of Gen- 
eral Lord Roberts. Messrs. Rudyard Kipling, 
Percival Landon, H. A. Gwynne, and Lord Stanley, 
the press censor, were most concerned with the 
publication, assisted by Dr. Conan Doyle and Mr. 
Ralph, and contributions from all of these appear 
in the book. It seems to have been considered as 
very good fooling, of the British sort, likely to ex- 
asperate the enemy and dull the sensibilities of all 
to the realities of the work in hand. In a literary 
sense it is puerile. Mr. Kipling's contributions, 
particularly, seem to fall below his standard. 

An epitome of the achievements of 
the century just past, in the various 
fields of pure science, is the aim of 
Dr. Henry Smith Williams in his " Story of Nine- 
teenth Century Science" (Harper). A field so 
vast and a subject so intricate might well demand 
an encyclopaedia for adequate treatment. The 
great battles of theory and experiment in which 
the errors of the past have given way to current

a Century 
of Science. 



conceptions of the Universe, of matter, of energy, 
and of life, are depicted by the author with rare 
skill. A human interest is attached to the story 
by the effective introduction of glimpses of the per- 
sonalities of the great leaders in the century's 
progress, and by the inclusion of more than four 
score portraits of scientific worthies. The earlier 
part of the story receives a symmetrical treatment, 
with just appreciation of men and their contribu- 
tions to knowledge ; but the closing years of the 
century, with their crowding discoveries, are passed 
over in silence or receive but passing notice. The 
historical perspective is perhaps insufficient to jus- 
tify any review of so recent a period. Still, it seems 
too bad to drop biology with Darwin, and to make 
but incidental reference to the Rdntgen rays. No 
achievements of recent years have been more 
striking than those in the science of bacteriology ; 
but its results are here discussed only in their re- 
lation to scientific medicine, for our author is a 
disciple of the art of healing. This may also ex- 
plain the inclusion of the story of the rise of neu- 
rology, in the chapter on experimental psychology. 
But all this is only to quarrel with our author's 
categories. The first chapter, on science at the 
beginning of the century, and the closing one on 
unsolved problems, bring home to the reader the 
wonderful progress which has been made, and also 
the infinity of the regions as yet unexplored. The 
whole range of the sciences is included in the plan 
of the work, and the author has been very success- 
ful in freeing his subjects from technicalities for 
the general reader, and very felicitous in clothing 
the changing theme with an unfailing charm. 

For many years Mr. Alfred Russel 
NaturaUs?. Wallace has been a frequent con- 

tributor to periodical literature on 
themes scientific and otherwise. These scattered 
writings have been collected in two volumes of 
" Studies Scientific and Social " (Macmillan). The 
essays have been revised, and in some cases greatly 
expanded by the introduction of copious illustrations. 
Many of them deal with the modern theory of 
Evolution and with the exposition and defence of 
one of its principal factors, Natural Selection, whose 
discovery the author shares with Darwin. The 
problems of the distribution of plants, animals, and 
the races of mankind, of utility, of inheritance, of 
instinct, and of race progress, are discussed broadly 
and with the freedom from technical details de- 
sired by the general reader. The second volume 
is concerned with educational, political, social, 
and ethical topics, and includes several essays not 
before published, among which is a pointed reply 
to the article in which Mr. Bradley Martin, Jr., 
seeks to justify lavish expenditure by men of wealth. 
Several essays on the nationalization of land are 
added, as are also the two closing chapters which, 
under the captions of " True Individuality " and 
" Justice not Charity," set forth our author's well- 
known panaceas for social wrongs. The writings

here collected throw many interesting side-lights 
not only upon the progress of the natural sciences 
in the last half century, but especially upon the 
career of one of the notable coterie of men whom 
the controversy over Darwinism brought into promi- 
nence naturalist, explorer, evolutionist, social 
reformer, and spiritualist. Many of the essays were 
originally published in American reviews, and some 
of them treat of distinctively American topics, 
though whatever Mr. Wallace might write is of 
interest in all lands. 

Mock heroics and travesties on clas- 

SSSS3U 8ical i ub J ects have dr pp ed 8 far 

from literary view in these days that 
Dr. James A. Henshall's "Ye Gods and Little 
Fishes, a Travesty on the Argonautic Expedition 
in Quest of the Golden Fleece " (Robert Clarke Co.) 
may be welcomed as affording considerable fun of 
a novel sort. The original itinerary of the Argo- 
nauts is followed with scrupulous care, but, as the 
" Argument " reads, the whole voyage is " illumined 
by the search-light of the nineteenth century," of 
which the following lines may be taken as an 
example : 

" Now Zetes, with some rods of brass, and reeds, 
And chariot wheels, made two velocipedes. 
With pedals on the front wheel, handle bar. 
And saddles made of shields ; they were by far 
The most astounding chariots ever seen 
Bicycles we would call them now, I ween. 
Thus, Zetes was the father of the bike ; 
His progeny to-day are not much like 
Their rude progenitors ; but as to speed 
Well, that's another story, as you '11 read." 

The book is dedicated to another celebrity, who 
seems ancient even now, Admiral George Dewey, 
with whom the author spent some pleasant days on 
Grecian shores long ago. It is elaborately designed 
and executed, with numerous embellishments. 

Essayton ^ r ' Frederick Storrs Turner pre- 

the theory of sents a volume to the philosophical 

public, with the title "Knowledge, 
Belief, and Certitude " and the sub-title " An In- 
quiry, with Conclusions" (Macmillan). The con- 
clusions, we are told, will not surprise the reader 
more than they have surprised the writer. We also 
read : " For the discovery of the conclusions reached 
by this inquiry, I am abundantly glad and thankful. 
So far as they are true and I have no doubt that 
they are true in the main they come from the 
only Source of all truth ; I am but the instrument 
through which they have been revealed." Such 
prefatorial remarks are unfair to critic and reader. 
They suggest a nawetS of philosophic experience 
which much of the further treatment bears out. 
And yet the candid critic, before he has turned the 
last leaf, is glad to record that he has found many 
worthy things cleverly said within its covers. 
However obvious the weaknesses of the work, its 
readability, freshness, earnestness, freedom from 
impedimenta, and general level of controversy, are 
much to be commended. Many of these qualities 



make it a book good for the hands of students 
approaching the theory of knowledge, which is in- 
deed the substantial problem of the work. The 
author runs rather far afield in the pursuit of his 
problem, and the conclusions are really not revolu- 
tionary nor breath-depriving. They are familiar in 
structure, and present no long-lost missing link of 
the evolution of knowledge. None the less they 
are suggestive, have a sufficiently original manner 
of approach, and are of interest to other thinkers. 
The work is on the whole a commendable one, 
though somewhat weak in its historical perspective, 
and rendered weaker by the author's unfortunate 
preface. 

A recent addition to the series of 
" Beacon Biographies " (Small, May- 
nard & Co.) is the life of Louis 
Agassiz by Alice Bache Gould. The little volume 
is full not only of the facts of the great scientist's 
life, but also of the great and lovable spirit of the 
man. Something of the noble optimism and the 
high enthusiasm that was so great a part of his 
power as a teacher finds a place in the pages and 
gives them vitality. The author writes with evident 
delight on the many-sided nature of her subject, 
and this pleasure finds expression in a wealth of 
stories that bring the great investigator's simple 
and sweet devotion to the aims of his life very near 
to us. While the volume lays stress more particu- 
larly upon the personal side of the life, it makes as 
full a showing of the scientific ideals that controlled 
Agassiz, and of the things that he accomplished, as 
the ordinary reader will care for. Further, the 
author has written with such sparkling clearness, 
and with such entertaining charm of style, that the 
book might well be pleasant reading for anyone.

perhaps, and will scarcely win the attention it 
would have attracted had it followed closer on the 
heels of the Rennes trial. The famous ' Affaire " 
is now matter of history, and the public mind is 
fully made up on its merits. It is well, however, 
to hear the victim's last word in the matter, and 
what he has to say is of considerable interest. The 
pith of the book lies in the author's diary of his 
Devil's Island experiences, and the tale he tells is 
assuredly a harrowing one. Other chapters sketch 
the author's life, and recount the various stages of 
the " Affaire," from the arrest of Dreyfus to the 
close of the Rennes court martial. The author ends 
by declaring that he proposes to go on striving for 
a full reparation of the judicial error " of which 
he is the victim.

[June 1, 



auspicious an opening with Miss Lynch's sprightly 
book on France. Mr. Dawson's sketch lacks some- 
thing of the vivacity of its predecessor, but its tone 
is more impersonal and its general conclusions seem 
more carefully weighed. It opens with a thought- 
ful survey of German imperial questions and con- 
ditions, and thence passes to the consideration of 
specific topics Social Divisions, the " Arbeiter," 
Rural Life, Military Service, Pastimes, The Ber- 
liner, the Press, etc. The treatment is at once 
descriptive and critical, and the author is evidently 
well informed. The illustrations are pleasing and 
well chosen. 

Mr. Barry Pain's " Another English- 
h woman's Love-Letters " (Putnam) is 
a rather clever parody on the popu- 
lar book which its title clearly points to, and the 
question as to the genuineness of which Mr. Pain 
answers decidedly in the negative in his preface. 
He adds : " It is difficult to imagine that anybody 
would have the treacherous impudicity to publish 
the love-letters of a woman recently dead, without 
even a plea of historical interest." We don 't know 
about that. Another outcome of the love-letter 
craze (now, we trust) on the wane) is the dainty, 
vellum-bound, ribbon-tied booklet containing " An 
Englishman's Love-Letters " (Mansfield). This 
author also is "in merry pin," and makes an honest 
effort to be amusing. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

We now have three or four excellent school histories 
of the United States, prepared for the use of the upper 
classes of secondary schools. Among them there is none 
better than the work of the late Alexander Johnston, 
which has long been held in high esteem. In its present 
form, the earlier revision by Mr. W. M. Daniels has 
been supplemented by a still later revision at the hands 
of Dr. William MacDonald, and the result is a work 
that may be confidently commended as one of the best 
of its class. It seems to be supplied with every sort of 
helpful adjunct that the teacher could wish. Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. are the publishers. 

The attractively made volume entitled " Faneuil 
Hall and Faneuil-Hall Market," by Mr. Abram English 
Brown, tells the story of those two famous Boston edi- 
fices and their founders, and goes in some detail into 
the historical events, local and general, with which 
their names are interwoven. The book is soberly writ- 
ten and informing, and is the fruit of painstaking re- 
search. It is appropriately illustrated. (Lee & Shepard.) 

We have come to expect work of a very scholarly 
type from the Columbia series of " Studies in Litera- 
ture " (Macmillan), and the latest addition to this series 
maintains the standard set by its predecessors. It is a 
study, by Mr. Henry Osborn Taylor, of " The Classical 
Heritage of the Middle Ages," and bridges over the 
transition period between the Classical and Mediaeval 
epochs in a philosophical manner. The centuries from 
the fourth to the seventh take up the greater part of 
the discussion. Boethius, the Fathers, Monasticism, the 



Corpus Juris, and early Christian poetry and art, are 
among the subjects treated. The style of the essay is 
admirable, and scholars will be thankful for the appen- 
dix of bibliographical notes. 

" The World's Work " is so young a magazine that 
a bound volume comes to our table as a sort of surprise, 
for we had hardly realized that six numbers were 
already in existence. It makes a valuable record of 
contemporary industrial and political activity, and the 
illustrations, as its monthly readers know, are of excep- 
tional beauty and interest. The work of the world 
is taken in a rather narrow sense by the editor of 
this magazine, and we could wish that its materialism 
were more nearly counterbalanced by its idealism. 
(Doubleday.) 

" A Treasury of Irish Poetry in the English Tongue," 
edited by Messrs. Stopford A. Brooke and T. W. Rol- 
leston, is a publication of the Macmillan Co. The 
method of the work is that of Mr. Ward's " English 
Poets," comprising a general editorial introduction, and 
signed critical notices of each of the poets included. 
Of these there are over one hundred, ranging from 
Sheridan, Moore, and Father Prout, through the poets 
of " The Nation," down to such very modern writers 
as "A. E.," Mr. W. B. Yeats, Mr. Lionel Johnson, 
Mrs. Shorter, and Mrs. Tynan-Hinkson. The work is 
an extremely well-edited and exhaustive anthology, and 
no one can examine it, even casually, without feeling a 
deepened respect for the Irish contribution to the wealth 
of English poetry. 

Dr. Albrecht Wirth is the author of an important 
study in political science entitled "Volkstum und 
Weltmacht in der Geschichte " (Munich: Bruckmann). 
It is a work of the most vital interest for our age of 
race-conflicts and rivalries for the attainment of world- 
power. The author is well fitted, both by study and 
travel, to discuss these great problems in the philosoph- 
ical spirit, and his synthetic grasp of his subject is re- 
markable. The style of the work is clear and forcible 
to a degree uncommon among German scholars, and 
the mechanical features of the book are attractive and 
dignified. 

We have received Volumes XIII. and XIV. of the 
" Cornell Studies in Classical Philology." The first of 
these monographs is a study of " The Subjunctive Sub- 
stantive Clauses in Plautus not Including Indirect 
Questions," by Mr. Charles L. Durham. The second 
title requires a long preliminary breath to be taken. 
It reads: "A Study in Case Rivalry, being an Investi- 
gation Regarding the use of the Genetive and the Ac- 
cusative in Latin with Verbs of Remembering and 
Forgetting." The work bears the name of Mr. Clinton 
L. Babcock as its author. 

Publication 45 of the Field Columbian Museum is 
" A Synopsis of the Mammals of North America and 
the Adjacent States," prepared by Mr. Daniel Giraud 
Elliot. It is a work of 471 pages, handsomely printed 
and abundantly illustrated. Its tendency is to be 
catholic in the recognition of species, but the writer 
sounds a note of warning on the subject of their multi- 
plication, and is strongly convinced that a more critical 
examination will greatly reduce the number in the near 
future. The half-tone plates, mostly of crania, illus- 
trate almost every genus and subgenus now recognized 
among our North American Mammalia. The work is 
of the highest scientific value, and does great credit to 
the Foundation which has made possible the series of 
publications to which it belongs.

NOTES. 



" First Studies of Plant Life," by Professor George F. 
Atkinson, is a nature-book for children, pnblisbed by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

Tennyson's "Idylls of the King," edited by Dr. 
William T. Vlymen, is the latest addition to the 
" Pocket Classics " of the Macmillan Co. 

Mr. John Lane's " Flowers of Parnassus " series of

phrase, with illustrations by Mr. Herbert Cole. 

Mr. R. H. Russell publishes a selection of the " Rac-

don, selected and arranged by Mr. T. O. Guen. 

Berkeley's " Principles of Human Knowledge " is 
added by the Open Court Publishing Co. to their " Re- 
ligion of Science Library," which now appears in an 
attractive new cover. 

Messrs. A. J. Holman & Co., Philadelphia, send us 
a " Self -Pronouncing Bible Dictionary " for the vest- 
pocket. It is indexed, printed on thin paper, and pro- 
vided with covers of flexible leather. 

" A Text- Book of Psychology for Secondary Schools," 
by Dr. Daniel Putnam, and " How to Teach Reading 
and Composition," by Dr. J. J. Burns, are the latest 
educational publications of the American Book Co. 

" Qualitative Chemical Analysis, Organic and Inor- 
ganic," by Dr. F. Moll wo Perkin, is published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. The same publishers also 
send us a book of " Exercises in Natural Philosophy," 
by Professor Magnus Maclean. 

The latest addition to the " Temple Classics " series 
(Macmillan) is a reprint of White's " Selborne," sup- 
plied with notes, marginalia, index, etc., by Mr. Charles 
Weekes. A dainty photogravure frontispiece and a 
number of Bewick's wood-cuts illustrate the volume. 

"The Earliest Lives of Dante," being translations 
from Boccaccio and Arctino, made by Mr. James Rob- 
inson Smith, is one of the " Yale Studies in English," 
and is published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. While 
not exactly a study in English literature, the publication 
is a desirable one, and we are not disposed to quarrel 
over its proper designation. 

Mr. Maurice Hewlett's " Earthwork out of Tuscany ' 
now appears in a revised edition (the third) as a vol- 
ume of the familiar " Eversley " series, issued by the 
Macmillan Co. The book is altogether worthy of in- 
clusion in the ranks of " that good company which 
wears the crimson of Eversley," and we are glad to 
have at last an American edition in such fitting form. 

The Third Book of the series of geographies prepared 
for the Macmillan Co. by Messrs. Ralph S. Tarr and 
Frank M. McMurry, has for its special title, " Europe 
and Other Continents, with Review of North America." 
Like its predecessors, this volume is richly and attrac- 
tively illustrated. With such books as these available 
for teachers, the cumbersome old-time geography ought 
soon to become a memory of the educational past. 

First published in 1896 as a volume of the "Ex

orative Illustration of Books " has come to occupy a 
place of authority in its own field; the wealth of illus- 
trative examples, no less than the historical and critical 
value of the text, making it an indispensable handbook 
for the student or book-lover. A new and cheaper 
edition of the work, with some slight revisions in the 
text, is issued in attractive form by the Macmillan Co.

The POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY for June 

Opens with an article by Professor J. W. Tuomey, of the newly established Yale Forest School, on 
the forest reservations of the United States. The importance of these great reservations for the 
future of the country is scarcely appreciated, and this article, with its beautiful illustrations, will 
call attention to these national parks, whose area is more than fifteen times the State of Connecticut. 
Another elaborately illustrated article in the number is one by Professor Francis H. Herrick, of 
Adelbert College, describing his newly discovered method of photographing and studying birds at 
arm's length. Dr. David Starr Jordan, President of Stanford University, contributes a study of the 
decay of races through the survival of the unfit, arguing that war weakens the nation by destroying 
its best material. Professor Robert H. Thurston, Director of Sibley College, Cornell University, 
traces the progress and tendency of mechanical engineering during the nineteenth century. Pro- 
fessor James Lewis Howe, of Washington and Lee University, contributes an article on the periodic 
law, a scientific generalization, the importance of which is ranked with the law of gravitation or the 
theory of evolution, yet regarding which many intelligent people are not informed. Mr. Havelock 
Ellis continues his study of British men of genius, tracing their marriage and family and the age 
to which they lived. An address by the late Professor Henry A. Rowland, of the Johns Hopkins 
University, entitled "A Plea for Pure Science," points out the defects and needs of science in 
America. Dr. Gary N. Calkins, of Columbia University, describes the malaria-bearing parasite, by 
means of which the mosquito spreads this disease, the most important scientific advance since the 
discovery of the RiJntgen Rays. The number, as usual, closes with short notes describing the most 
recent progress of science.

CHINA AND THE ALLIES 

BY A. HENRY SAVAGE LANDOR 

Famous as a traveller, and the author of " In the Forbidden Land." 



With 269 Illustrations. 

5 full-page Chinese prints, reproduced in 
their original colors and illustrating 
phases of the uprising, including various 
forms of torture devised by the Chinese 
for the punishment of foreigners. 

16 full pages in tints, illustrating important 
scenes in the war. 

4-8 full pages in black and white, from pho- 
tographs and drawings by the author. 

200 text illustrations, mostly from photo- 
graphs taken by the author, and a few 
from drawings. 



A N impartial and masterly' review of the 
** recent military operations in China and 
the events preceding them. Mr. Landor was 
the first European to enter the Forbidden City 
as a guest by the side of the Russian General. 
Holding no official position, and bound by no 
official etiquette, he was perhaps the only eye- 
witness at liberty to report all that he saw. 



In two large octavo volumes, each 6x9 
inches in size, with a total of 136 
chapters and 876 pages. $7.50 net. 

Affords a comprehensive view of the whole 
Chinese difficulty, tracing the anti- foreign 
movement to its original sources, and follow- 
ing the progress of the allies to their settlement 
in Pekin pending the diplomatic finale still in 
abeyance. 

Shows the development and the true nature 
of the Boxer movement by translations of the 
most interesting Boxer circulars and posters, 
and by the official records of the allied powers. 

Compares the allied forces in action and 
inaction in vigorous and unsparing phrase, 
presenting word - pictures whose impartiality 
and truth are self-evident. 

Throws a new and impartial light upon the 
much-vexed missionary question, and shows 
that Chinese hatred of foreigners, contrary to 
recent statements, embraces Americans as well 
as others.

Two years ago Mr. Winston Churchill's "Richard Carvel" was 
published the most successful novel of its kind ever issued 
Two weeks ago to=day Mr. Churchill published his new novel- 

THE CRISIS 

THE BEST STORY THIS AUTHOR HAS YET WRITTEN 



During the past week the publishers have been watching the comments of the Press with 
deep interest, and they have not yet seen a single adverse criticism. Out of the many notices 
already received, the publishers take the liberty of quoting a few 

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS: 

" Mr. Winston Churchill has gained greatly in the power of making a character live and breathe before your 
eyes, and reveal its own personality through its part in conversation and through its deeds." Boston Herald. 

" The love story is charmingly told. Mr. Churchill, it must be acknowledged, has scored a distinct success 
with this book. It is full of brilliant bits, clever epigrams, flashing analysis, and displays withal a broad grasp 
upon the meaning of things as they stood related to events and to history in those dark years of the nation's 
travail. It is not too much to say that it is the best novel founded on the Civil War period that has yet been 
published." Brooklyn Daily Eagle. 

" A book that presents the great crisis in our national life with splendid power, and with a sympathy, a sin- 
cerity, and a patriotism that are inspiring. The several scenes in the book in which Abraham Lincoln figures 
must be read in their entirety, for they give a picture of that great, magnetic, loveable man which has been drawn 
with evident affection and exceptional success." Chicago Tribune. 

" The reader is swept along by a relentless series of events toward the inevitable crash which shook the nation. 
Men, then obscure, whose names now will ring till the end of time, pass simply and naturally through these pages." 
The Bookman. 

" ' The Crisis ' is a book which it is a pleasure to recommend. It promises to be one of the popular successes, 
and, unlike a good many popular successes, it really deserves to succeed." New York Commercial Advertiser. 

" Above all, ' The Crisis ' is a book every American should know, for it teaches him anew to revere 
the memory of the men to whom this nation owes its continued existence, to bow in gratitude to even the 
least of them who struggled on the hustings and in daily life, or later shouldered a musket, that this 
nation, under God, should have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, 
for the people, should not perish from the earth." NEW YORK MAIL AND EXPRESS. 



The great popularity of " Richard Carvel," 375,000 copies of this novel having been sold, 
has led the publishers to print 100,000 copies for the first edition of " The Crisis." The first 
orders will consume the entire stock. 

The book has eight charming Illustrations by HOWARD CHANDLER CHRISTY. 
In size and style it is uniform with "Richard Carvel," being 12mo, cloth, gilt top, $1.50.

THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 

It seems only yesterday that we were ex- 
tending the right hand of fellowship to the 
University of Chicago, and congratulating our 
city upon so notable an acquisition to the agen- 
cies that stand for its higher life. But it seems 
that ten full years have rolled by, after all, for 
the University is now engaged in the celebra- 
tion of its first decennial. As university cele- 
brations go, a ten-year period does not count 
for much. We think of such European fes- 
tivities as have been witnessed of recent years 
in Heidelberg and Bologna, of such American 
anniversaries as the quarter-millennial of Har- 
vard, the sesquincentennial of Princeton, and 
the approaching bicentennial of Yale. Chicago 
will doubtless have affairs like these in due 
time, but none of us will live to participate in 
them, and we can hardly be expected to forego 
the modest opportunities that lie within our 
reach. This is a community of large under- 
takings and rapid developments, and who that 
has breathed its ozonized air will be daring 
enough to suggest that a decade of Chicago is 
not the equivalent of one or more cycles of 
Cathay ? Besides, our University has acquired 
a certain degree of antiquity by the simple 
process of taking up the abandoned dignities 
and responsibilities of the old Chicago Uni- 
versity. In adopting as its own all of the 
earlier institution that there was left to adopt, 
it has come into possession of a fine collection 
of gray-bearded alumni, and of a respectable 
historical tradition which reaches back to the 
period of the Civil War. 

Those who remember the defunct institution 
thus restored to a ghostly sort of life will be 
impressed by the contrast between the con- 
ditions of the sixties and the conditions of the 
nineties. The beggar's wallet has been replaced 
by the purse of Fortunatus, and results are 
now achieved with little seeming effort that 
were beyond the wildest dreaming of a gene- 
ration ago. Contrast, for example, with the 
magnificent and rapidly-multiplying group of 
buildings which are the present visible sign of 
the University of Chicago, the single building 
of the sixties, waiting long years in vain for 



390 



THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



the means to build the modest wing that was 
needed to round out the symmetry of the orig- 
inal plan. Contrast, again, with the long 
faculty-roll of to-day the small band of scholars 
who gave life to the institution of yesterday ; 
with to-day's great museums and libraries, 
yesterday's unpretentious cabinets and book- 
shelves ; contrast even with the imposing as- 
tronomical establishment of the present the 
famous old observatory which was the chief 
material boast and pride of the past. Contrast, 
also, with the figure of the prosperous President 
of the new University of Chicago, whose chief 
care is merely to make the best use of the 
stream of wealth that pours into his lap, whose 
chief occupation is to devise new plans that 
shall outrun the resources so generously pro- 
vided, contrast with this figure that of the 
devoted head of the old Chicago University, 
who for years carried on a hopeless struggle 
to keep the institution alive, who heroically 
fought the monster of debt and bore up under 
the discouragement of public apathy, who gave 
to the school the whole of his energy and the 
whole of his private means, and who for his 
reward was compelled to see the mortgages 
foreclosed, the personal property put up for 
sale in ignominious ways, and the building 
itself razed to the ground. In our rejoicing 
at the success of the new institution, it is well 
that we give a thought to the old one, if only 
for the chastening influence of a view of the 
contrasting conditions. 

During the ten years of its existence, the 
University of Chicago has gained an assured 
place among the foremost institutions for higher 
education in this country. To accomplish such 
a result both money and intelligent direction 
were needed, and in neither has the University 
been lacking. In the matter of its endowment 
and property holdings, it stands among the 
half-dozen wealthiest institutions of learning in 
the United States. Its faculty, while notice- 
ably uneven with respect to the several depart- 
ments, probably numbers altogether as large a 
proportion of highly-distinguished scholars as 
is to be found in any university on this side of 
the Atlantic. It has outlived the probationary 
period, and stands to-day as a recognized influ- 
ence for the promotion of the highest ideals of 
scholarship. The fears which its well-wishers 
entertained at the start lest it should develope 
into a sectarian institution have been dissipated, 
and the gibes of earlier years at " the Baptist 
school on the Midway " have ceased to have 
any possible significance. Not only has the 



spirit of its teaching been free from any sec- 
tarian taint, but it has also been free from 
every other form of social or caste restraint 
upon the exercise of unhampered investigation. 
The newspaper agitation of a few years ago, 
accusing the University authorities of interfer- 
ing with the freedom of teaching, was so easily 
shown to have been prompted by either malice 
or ignorance that no person capable of intelli- 
gent judgment is likely again to support such 
a charge. The University has from the begin- 
ning encouraged original research, and the 
contributions of its faculty to the advancement 
of science have been considerable in many de- 
partments, such, for example, as those of 
physics, physiology, economics, sociology, an- 
thropology, and classical philology. The pub- 
lications of members of the faculty during the 
ten years make an imposing showing, and we 
may mention the fact that they include, in 
addition to work of a strictly scholarly type, a 
considerable amount of work in imaginative 
literature. In the ranks of this faculty there 
have already been developed one of the most 
remarkable of our younger novelists and one of 
the most inspired of our younger poets. 

If asked for a statement of the leading idea 
for which this University has stood, the answer 
would have to be that it has represented the 
idea of educational experimentation more dis- 
tinctly than any other institution. Now experi- 
mentation means innovation, for one thing, and 
an expenditure of tentative effort, for another. 
Conservative minds view these things with 
suspicion, and they no doubt have to pay a 
certain penalty. Innovations are not always 
wise, and tentative effort is, in its very nature, 
something not quite sure of its aim. But the 
openness of outlook to which these things lead 
is so desirable a thing to gain that a certain 
amount of misapplied energy, and even of direct 
waste, is not too heavy a price to pay for it. 
On the whole, we should say that the experi- 
mental policy of this University has been jus- 
tified by the results. A good many interesting 
ideas, both in administration and in education 
proper, have been developed, and enough of 
them have proved worth developing to com- 
pensate for the uncertainties and the failures 
that are the inevitable occasional concomitants 
of such a policy. 

To the community in which it is placed, the 
University of Chicago has proved itself a bene- 
ficent influence. If it has not leavened the 
whole lump, it has at least done something to 
restore the balance from the side of passion

and materialism toward the side of reason and 
idealism. All of our good social and intellec- 
tual causes find in it a helpful ally, and it is 
exerting a growing influence with every added 
year of its existence. As it continues to broaden 
and deepen in its own work, we may safely be- 
lieve that the community of which it is a part 
will feel at least the indirect effects of its 
development, and will share in the uplifting 
influence of its manifold activities. We are 
thankful for its help during the decade now 
ended ; we shall expect it to do even more for 
us during the decade now beginning. 



TRIUMPH OF THE "LITERARY PL A Y." 

At the Grand Opera House, Chicago, a recent inci- 
dent delightful in itself and significant in dramatic 
annals drew the largest audiences of the season, 
although the rates were raised for the time. Three 
presentations were given of Browning's " In a 
Balcony," preceded by Mr. Yeats's " The Land of 
Heart's Desire." 

The project originated with Mrs. Sarah Cowell 
Le Moyne, who played the " Queen " in the Brown- 
ing piece for which she wisely chose Mr. Otis 
Skinner as " Norbert " and Miss Eleanor Robson 
as " Constance." The cast in the companion piece 
was also arranged by Mrs. Le Moyne, who devised 
the staging of both productions in all details, in- 
cluding costumes, properties, and histrionic chia- 
roscuro, which is as indispensable to a play as to a 
picture, an efficient fusion of energy, inertia, and 
color, mental and physical. The light and shade 
of a drama demands obedience to the canons of 
sculpture, painting, and poetry, as well as to those 
of acting, and is psychologic as well as mechanical. 
For the latter division of the composition, electri- 
cians, carpenters, and confederates accompanied the 
players over a route which extended from the At- 
lantic to the head of the lakes and through the 
middle West, everywhere received by large and 
cordial audiences, who set approval on an under- 
taking springing from a woman's devotion to liter- 
ature and belief in the stage and in her country, an 
undertaking requiring a manager with faith in 
literature upon the stage and in the talents of all 
engaged for its living interpretation. 

To Mrs. Katberine Tynan Hinkson I am in- 
debted for the personal acquaintance of Mr. William 
Butler Yeats. Pale, slender, just entering then on 
manhood, he seemed, in his lustrous dark eyes, 
modest demeanor, sincerity, earnestness, and uncon- 
scious air of abstraction, what a man must be who 
wrought in journalism for bread of the body, and 
for necessity of his soul wrote poetry as a luxury. 
His father painted portraits for luxury, and sup- 
ported his family in a cozy and hospitable suburban 



London home by sketching for the illustrated 
journals. The family had removed from Dublin, 
like many Celts who had preceded them, for 
the opportunity denied them in their native land, 
Mr. William Butler Yeats had known from child- 
hood the Gaelic lore whose scope and depth have 
been at last apprehended throughout scholardom, 
and whose resources many are now diffusing.* 

At Hildesheim, Germany, one sees a clambering 
rose-tree on a lofty cathedral wall. The record is 
unquestioned and unbroken showing that its roots 
are deep in the ground for a thousand years. Its 
roses are of every summer, white and sweet. Its 
tendrils twine about column and cornice, and its 
petals fall upon mediaeval graves in the churchyard. 
Thus the roots of this long obscured Gaelic litera- 
ture send their sap up to the heights of the present 
day, and the roses are now for witness of mankind 
to its beauty and purity. In the oldest songs and 
stories there is often, as in the Greek, the Latin, 
and the Norse, something offensive to taste ; there 
are occasionally theories, suggestions, implications 
repugnant to the highest ideals. In old Gaelic the 
roses have thorns, as roses must ; but, so far as 
disclosure goes, they lack worms as roses should. 

Mr. Yeats's play has for its predominant per- 
sonage a type of the imaginary creation between 
the human and the spiritual the fairy. The 
human heroine is a bride, discontented because her 
husband is off all day in the fields and she is nagged 
by his mother's tongue. The bridegroom's father 
balances with amiability his wife's sourness. The 
village priest figures symbolically in the play, strain- 
ing probability, for belief in the fairy can scarcely 
survive seminary dialectic. The poet's purpose re- 
quires that the Christian minister shall remove the 
crucifix from the wall to soothe the elfin temper it dis- 
tracts ; thus teaching that even to gentle sympathies 
ethical truth should not be sacrificed. The fairy 
insidiously absorbs the soul of the bride, symbolically 
warning humanity against succumbing to unhappi- 
ness instead of seeking to overcome its causes and to 
ennoble those who may contribute to it. The inci- 
dental music, by Julian Edwards, was racy of the soil. 
All the story was compacted into a single scene. Its 
interest was breathless, its execution exquisite. 

" The Land of Heart's Desire " is written in un- 
jingled verse, filling forty pages, small octavo. 
Prior to its publication, Mr. Yeats had been known 
chiefly, but not exclusively, by lyrics. It is difficult

Gaelic in the stricter sense, and Manx (spoken in the Isle of

from each other in the ninth century. The oldest monuments 
are the old Gaelic inscriptions (Ogham is the native name for 
the Gaelic runes), which possibly date as far hack as about 
500 A. D. The literary record of Irish begins in the eighth 
century, at first with glosses, and then from the year 1100

to be a Dubliner and not dramatic. The Dublin 
stage has a fame unbounded by its insular frontier. 
Great actors have been known to prefer an audience 
of Dublin gamins to aristocracy and the blood 
royal. There Sarah Ward studied while her parents 
pursued the craft she bequeathed to her illustrious 
daughter, Sarah Siddons. There were seen probably 
the greatest trio ever together on any stage a 
Garrick, a Barry, and a Sheridan in a single cast. 
Thither, balked on the continent, baffled in London, 
Handel went, seeking not in vain an opportunity to 
produce for the first time the greatest of oratorios, 
the " Messiah." 

Notwithstanding the vigor of Mr. Yeats's first 
play, it required a sagacity born of both intuition 
and experience to stage it. However fascinating to 
the imagination, to visualize a production of which 
the intangible is an indispensable living element 
might well make a manager pause. Wholly free 
from meretriciousness, the illusion was complete. 
The mystic power which answered on the "good 
people's " night the illicit prayer of the discontented 
bride was deliciously suggested in the green coat 
and red cap, the curling locks, the limpid voice, the 
sprite-like dance, the uncanny laughter, the weird 
song, and the witching eyes of a girl of fourteen, 
who played with volatility and rare insight.* 
There was an absence of seeming incongruity be- 
tween the ethereal and the human participants in 
the tragedy. The lines which room may not be 
taken to quote open up wide vista in many direc- 
tions. The bride said to the priest : 

" Father, I am right weary of four tongues : 
A tongue that is too crafty and too wise, 
A tongue that is too godly and too grave, 
A tongue that is more bitter than the tide, 
And a kind tongue too full of drowsy love, 
Of drowsy love and my captivity." 

The fairy replied : 

" But I can lead you, newly married bride, 
Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue, 
And where kind tongues bring no captivity, 
For we are only true to the far lights, 
We follow singing, over valley and hill." 

It was the " far lights " that allured the typical 
woman of the play. 

It was not strange that Mrs. Le Moyne, who re- 
ceived from Robert Browning himself, after repeated 
hearings, an authoritative commission to interpret 
his works as a reader, should have conceived the 
plan of putting one of the poems on the boards. 
To the ordinary vision, " In a Balcony " would 
appear unavailable because the entire theatrical 
vehicle would have to be invented. There are

twenty-eight pages of long speeches and nothing 
else. As every inch of a scene must be almost math- 
ematically defined to its specific end, and as there 
is nothing defined in the poem but three fugitive 
sketches with no " acting version," the stage man- 
agement had to assume the substance of casuistry. 

Long speeches are the terror alike of players 
and observers. But not a line was cut, except one 
to reconcile the embodiment of the queen with a 
personality too young to make up for the age attrib- 
uted in the text. There were several departures, 
however, from the text as originally printed, alter- 
ations made by Robert Browning after Mrs. Le 
Moyne had read the poem to him. From the pene- 
trative shading of her tones his ear detected dis- 
sonances which had escaped his eye. 

Neither play would make a " bill " alone. It is 
fundamental in art that association shall be by con- 
trast or by harmony, thus verifying the truth that 
art is unity in variety. In the combination made 
by Mrs. Le Moyne, both principles are exemplified. 
Contrast is potent between the splendor of an antique 
Italian palace and the squalor of a peasant cottage ; 
between the grandiose in architecture and embel- 
lishment, the magnificent in costumes (magnificent 
they were), and tropical gardens, on the one hand, 
and the barrenness of a rustic kitchen on the other. 
Harmony was eloquent in the identity of the motive 
of the two plays : 

" That every inordinate cup is unbless'd." 
The queen yearned unlawfully for the love of "Nor- 
bert." The bride wished for an unwarranted release. 
Contrast appears again in the method of conse- 
quences. Force ends the lives, presumably, of the 
conspirators who, to compass their mutual object, 
had shamed and tricked their benefactress. An 
unearthly spell consumes the life of the bride, dis- 
loyal to her troth in a wish for its annulment. 

The culminating episode in which " Constance " 
and "Norbert" are discovered by the queen in 
their true relationship proved a marvellous exhibi- 
tion of inarticulate acting by Mrs. Le Moyne, acting 
which cannot properly be called pantomime, although 
inarticulate. It was necessary to accept for the 
queen, whom, in a naturally regal bearing, Mrs. 
Le Moyne admirably represented (the question of 
age aside), monarchic humiliation, and, still more 
abasingly, affront to womanly delicacy. There are 
great actresses who, to simulate frenzy, have been 
seen to pluck the hair from the head of a sofa ; to 
escape tearing a passion to tatters, to tear a hand- 
kerchief. To indicate rage without words, gyratory 
gesture has served, with a wild physiognomy. Per- 
plexity or indifference has shrugged shoulders ; 
cunning has lifted eyebrows, and languor or confu- 
sion dropped them. Defiance has been known to 
dislocate garments or the ringlets of a wig. Mrs. 
Le Moyne wore her own brown hair, and, with 
ideal queenly composure, disturbed neither that nor 
any other material thing on the stage. Not only silent 
but almost motionless throughout the long final collo-

quy, each is her artistic vitality that, resting against 
the balustrade for seemingly needed physical sap- 
port for the distraught Queen," the acting of the 
mind, graphic through the lines of her tormentors, 
permeated the atmosphere. The audience saw, or 
heard, a despair, a fury, a supreme agony and sov- 
ereign determination transmitted from the brain to 
the face by that indefinable power which only a few 
of the greatest players have been able to employ 
inarticulately and convincingly. The effect was 
due in a measure to Mrs. Le Moyne's noble render- 
ing of the queen's previous long speeches : for true 
reading " is utterance of another's words as if 
the thought were conceived at that moment in the 
mind of the speaker and spoken for the first time. 
So complete was Mrs. Le Moyne's antecedent 
identification of herself with the queen, by voice, 
deportment, and action, that the confessions and 
betrayal in the lines of the lovers were apparently 
anticipated in the eyes, the face, and the subtle 
flexibility of the queen's figure, which never lost 
grace and scarcely seemed to lose fixedness. We 
have been assured that 

" There 'a no art 
To find the mind's construction in the face." 

Shakespeare had not seen a face of such mobility 
as Mrs. Le Moyne's. Half the house would prob- 
ably have affirmed during that scene that the queen 
was speaking. 

It has been mechanically demonstrated by Rous- 
selot that sounds may be produced and the normal 
ear fail in the closest proximity to catch them. The 
ear of the spirit is daintier. It hears sounds shaped 
only on the lips of the spirit. 

There are three kinds of speech accent. Linguis- 
tics note two, namely, accent of stress and accent 
of pitch. There is a third, the accent of silence. 
In highly phonetized languages for example, the 
Sanskrit suspension of voice is an essential of 
expression. It corresponds in vocal rhythm to the 
" rest " in music, which was " invented to give a 
necessary relief to the voice and a sweetness to the 
melody." Modern science corroborates Aristotle, 
that articulate speech differentiates the human race 
from other species. Treatises have been written to 
show that certain muscles are given to man solely 
that he may reveal his feelings to others.* With- 
out vocalization, without bringing to the sense of 
the audience evidence of muscular effort, Mrs. Le 
Moyne in that episode accomplished more exhaust- 
ively than by words the poet's purpose, when, with 
faltering, almost falling step, she at last passed in 
silence between the lovers, off the stage, leaving in 
her wake a terrible expectancy of swift vengeance. 

" When the vocal chords come together in rhyth- 
mical vibration," writes Brugmann, "a musical clang 
arises which is called voice. All sounds which are 
spoken with voice are called voiced, and those without 
voice, voiceless." The portion of " In a Balcony " 
which was on this occasion voiceless was the clear-

est of its speech. It was a singular illustration of 
subjective as distinguished from the simultaneous 
and excellent objective acting of Mr. Skinner and 
Miss Bobson. It rounded a symmetrical imperso- 
nation of one of Browning's most impracticable 
characters. 

That Browning is a familiar poet in American 
homes can no longer be doubted; for only that 
familiarity can explain, in part at least, the quality 
of the audiences assembled all over the country to 
enjoy this programme of which the junior author 
is necessarily in only the beginning of an assured 
career. Mr. Yeats has published several other 
volumes, prose and verse, and the play " Countess 
Kathleen." 

"Strictly speaking," writes Mr. A. W. Ward 
(" English Dramatic Literature," Vol. I., p. viii.), 
dramatic literature is that form of literary compo- 
sition which accommodates itself to the demands of 
an art whose method is imitation in the way of 
action." That the action may be more of the mind 
and less of the body, yet the imitation be vital, was 
established in the production of these two poems. 
The victory of mind over matter in the first was 
the artistic incorporation of the incorporeal. That 
was due in equal measures to the poet, the stage 
direction, and the performers. An adroit mutation 
of relative values in the Browning poem transferred 
the sympathy of the audience from the hapless young 
lovers to the discredited queen, a mutation wrought 
by Mrs. Le Moyne's adroit recall of the character 
from an old to a seemingly only middle-aged woman, 
with an exaltation, a pathos, and a power which 
were irresistible. 

A financial result commensurate with the aesthetic 
charm of an undertaking now an achievement dem- 
onstrates that the American stage is ripe for the 
literary play adequately presented. 

MAKOABET F. 



IT is impossible, upon this occasion, to do more than 
chronicle the death of Sir Walter Besant, which took 
place at Hampstead, on the ninth of Jane, after an ill- 
ness of several weeks' duration. He was in his sixty- 
fifth year, and, to judge from his recent work, in the 
full tide of his literary activities. Those activities are 
not to be properly measured by thinking of him in his 
character as a popular novelist. His fiction, although 
the work by which he was most widely known, is the 
work that will be soonest forgotten. Bat the world 
will not quickly forget him in his character as the 
champion of the rights of authorship, as the philanthro- 
pist of the People's Palace, as the historian of London, 
as the student of early French literature, as the worker 
for the Palestine Exploration Fund, and as the bio- 
grapher of Edward Palmer. In a word, his achieve- 
ments outside the domain of fiction were so varied and 
so important that the novels might be left out of the 
reckoning without serious loss to his reputation among 
the well-informed. A friend of all good causes, and an ar- 
dent worker in their behalf, his death leaves the world 
appreciably poorer, and he will be mourned far and wide.

PENNYPACKER'S LIFE or GENERAL, 
MEADE.* 



It is hardly too much to say that Mr. Isaac 
R. Pennypacker's Life of General George G. 
Meade is the most important single study bear- 
ing on the Civil War. The book covers the cen- 
tral operations of that war, describes its climax 
in the culminating battle, and details the long- 
drawn-out but inevitable final scenes. More 
than this, it presents a new view of the chief 
figures of that struggle, and draws from the 
background, where contemporary intrigues and 
injustice had thrust him, the finest spirit and 
ablest soldier of the war. If there is a deity 
who presides over contemporary fame, he must 
be thoroughly used by this time to posterity's 
rude reversals of his general verdicts. He puffs 
his cheeks, he clamors, he hustles, he howls on 
his hired claque, he confuses the judgments of 
men by their passions, he distributes his crowns 
and laurels. And then, suddenly, his day is 
done, " the tumult and the shouting die," his 
wreaths are discovered to be mainly of the 
deciduous kind, and the true heroes, or their 
ghosts, step out to receive their delayed reward. 

The vast mass of our war literature is, in 
the main, the work of interested actors in the 
struggle. It is valuable material for a writer 
who can make allowance for the fact that every 
man carries the centre of the visible horizon in 
his own head. But the publication of the Offi- 
cial War Records has at last given to historians 
the uncolored facts of the campaigns. Mr. 
Pennypacker has based his study on these rec- 
ords. He has collated them with patient mi- 
nuteness ; he has left no point uninvestigated ; 
he has even taken horse and ridden over the 
whole region of the operations he has described. 
The result is a combination of truth of detail 
and grasp of ensemble and directness of plain 
speech which is real history. He has brought 
clearness out of a weltering confusion and 
his deductions can only be traversed by some- 
one who will take similar pains and find equal 
facts to back him. The scheme of Mr. Penny- 
packer's book seems to be, in brief, to show 
the movements of the whole army and Meade's 
relations to them ; to focus all the evidence 
available, official and personal, in the narra- 
tive ; to give the plans and purposes of the

tions and maps. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



commanders, and then to describe the actual 
manoauvres and collisions as they occurred. 

The main difference between the North and 
the South in the conduct of the war was in the 
concentration of authority. Lee was in com- 
mand on his side. He could appoint his corps 
commanders and plan and fight his campaigns 
without much interference. Jefferson Davis 
was often at the front, but he did not carry a 
metaphorical guillotine with him. On the other 
side there was war by committee : the Presi- 
dent, the Cabinet, Senators, Representatives, 
and newspaper editors, were all strategists, 
and between them they hanged the successive 
Generals of the Army of the Potomac, " in 
order to encourage the others." General 
Meade learned the art of war under such cir- 
cumstances, and had experience of all the be- 
wildering changes. 

As a brigadier at Charles City Cross Roads, 
Meade, by a personal exploration at night, 
saved a large part of McClellau's army, which 
had taken the wrong road, from marching 
straight into the jaws of the enemy. Still 
under McClellan, he was the chief factor at 
South Mountain, and his capture of that strong- 
hold by assault compelled Lee's abandonment 
of his plan of campaign and the concentration 
behind Antietam Creek. At Fredericksburg, 
under Burnside, by one of the most brilliant 
charges of the war, he cut Lee's line, and if 
supported would have won a victory. This 
charge, in daring and measure of success, com- 
pares most favorably with that of Pickett's at 
Gettysburg, for it was over longer and more 
difficult ground, it penetrated farther into the 
enemy's position, it captured a number of flags 
and prisoners, and had a greater percentage of 
killed and wounded. At Chancellorsville the 
peremptory orders of Hooker held Meade in 
comparative inactivity. Had he been permitted 
to use his corps as he desired, the fate of the 
battle would probably have been different. As 
it was, the other officers, realizing Hooker's 
incapacity, looked to Meade to lead them. 
Reynolds sent a message " Tell General 
Meade that someone should be waked up to 
command this army." The Government seems 
to have reached the same conclusion ; for on 
the morning of June 28, 1863, Meade was 
aroused from sleep by the arrival of peremp- 
tory orders for him to take command of the 
Army of the Potomac. 

The battle of Gettysburg is the central jewel 
in America's war crown. It was nobly fought 
on both sides, but Lee was undoubtedly over-

matched in tactics. In the first place, his line 
was twice the length of Meade's, yet so well 
were the latter's forces disposed that Lee had 
no advantage of overlapping. In the second 
place, the sending of Longstreet, on the third 
day, against what was practically Meade's 
whole army in position, was a grievous error. 
Lee's successes on the first and second day, in 
fact, really solidified the Union lines. Mr. 
Pennypacker clears up a mass of controversy 
regarding this battle. Credits have been 
claimed for Hancock and Warren and Sickles 
to such an extent as to almost leave Meade 
barren laurels ; but Mr. Pennypacker cites 
record upon record and witness after witness 
to show that Meade was the directing and in- 
spiring mind throughout. In a few days he 
had gathered together his widely -scattered 
corps ; he directed the march and concentra- 
tion ; by his personal efforts on the second day 
he saved the Union left, imperilled by Sickles's 
error ; and he provided for and anticipated 
the attack on the centre on the third day. Mr. 
Pennypacker also disposes, finally it is hoped, 
of the clamor against Meade for not crushing 
Lee after the defeat. The North underesti- 
mated the power of the South before the war, 
at every crisis during the war, and yet after 
the war. One would think the terrible effec- 
tiveness of the Southern troops in defense came 
out clearly enough the next year. Outnum- 
bered twice or thrice, Lee yet baffled and 
checked the Union commanders, and was only 
overwhelmed at last by sheer weight of men. 
Meade had no superiority of numbers after 
Gettysburg to make an end of Lee in his almost 
impregnable position. As soon as possible he 
did move, and by skilful manoeuvres drove Lee 
across the Rapidan and gave his government 
time to summon up its forces and resources for 
the final struggle. 

If the combatants had only known it, the 
war was ended at Gettysburg. The rest was 
but the dragging of Hector's corpse around the 
walls of Troy. The South had no longer a 
chance to win. Yet the most deadly struggle 
of the war ensued. Those final tragic scenes 
remind one of the gloomy ending of the Nieb- 
elungenlied, where in the Hall of Etzel the 
Huns and the Burgundians fall together until 
all are gone. Splendid valor was displayed 
on either side, yet in a military point of view 
the fighting was certainly bad. Of what there 
was creditable, a great deal was due to Meade, 
though superseded in command by Grant. It 
was Meade, not Grant, who ordered and opened 



the Battle of the Wilderness ; it was Meade's 
Sixth Corps, not Sheridan's cavalry, which cut 
the Confederate lines at Petersburg; and at 
the very end of all, it rested upon Meade's 
decision to capture Lee and the remnant of his 
troops rather than let them surrender to Grant. 

Probably it is by his facts and opinions in 
this part of his book that Mr. Pennypacker 
will arouse the most controversy. He deals 
with Grant in a generous spirit, but hardly 
conceals his opinion that Meade would have 
finished the work better alone. His most 
startling statements are in regard to Sheridan. 
Again and again, by the records, the latter is 
proved to have been insubordinate, careless, 
even incompetent. He seems to have always 
wanted the centre of the stage with the lime- 
light turned upon him. He seems to have con- 
ceived of war as a grand, gigantic spree, in 
which he need have no concern for others. 
Grant's infatuation with him gave him all the 
opportunity he wanted. He was allowed to 
form the cavalry of the army into a separate 
command, and wander off into space seeking 
fights which were interesting in themselves but 
of no great value to the main objects of the 
campaign. He left Meade's flanks undefended, 
failed to collect information, and generally 
neglected the duties usually assigned to a cav- 
alry commander. Grant's support of him was 
of course indorsed by public opinion, for the 
public has little knowledge of the grave mat- 
ters of strategy, tactics, and supply, and has a 
genuine appreciation for a commanding officer 
who rises up in his stirrups and waves his 
sword above his head. Mr. Charles A. Dana, 
it may be noted, appears in Mr. Pennypacker's 
book in the somewhat unenviable light of 
Informer-in-Chief. 

What was Meade's reward ? England made 
Marlborough a duke, and gave him the im- 
perial domain and palace of Blenheim, for less 
vital services. Wellington was advanced to a 
dukedom for his work in the Peninsular War, 
and his whole monetary reward was about four 
millions of dollars. After Gettysburg, Meade, 
who was a Major in the Engineer Corps, was 
raised to the rank of Brigadier General in the 
Regular Army the same reward conferred 
upon Funston for the trapping of Aguinaldo. 
Meade was passed over for Grant, passed over 
for Sherman, passed over for Sheridan. That 
he felt his wrongs deeply, there can be no 
doubt ; but he did not sulk in his tent and he 
did not go about complaining. After the war 
he gave his native city the benefit of his taste

and skill in the laying out of its beautiful park. 
Brasidas, the Spartan General, is the central 
figure of the history of the Peloponnesian War. 
He goes up and down Greece, fighting battles, 
quelling revolts, redressing grievances. Where- 
ever anything is wrong, he is sure to turn up. 
Meanwhile nobody pays much attention to 
Brasidas, and Thucydides does not waste a 
word of his golden style in describing his per- 
sonality. Finally, Brasidas dies, and his his- 
torian permits himself a single sentence 
"Brasidas lived and died in the practice of every 
virtue." Meade somehow recalls the modest, 
unostentatious Greek hero. He too was always 
on hand at every crisis, to do the right thing 
and retrieve the errors of others. And if his 
present biographer does not quite equal Thu- 
cydides in his triumph of taciturnity, he at 
least does not indulge in any blare of trumpets 
over his hero. He is brief in his personal ref- 
erences. He gives us a glimpse of Meade 
awakened at night to take command of the 
Army of the Potomac at its most critical hour ; 
another of his riding into the gap between 
Sickles and the main line at Gettysburg, ready 
to charge at the head of a few officers and 
orderlies to stay the oncoming rush of the 
Confederate troops ; and in his final paragraph 
he thus sums up, as a logical deduction from 
his whole story, the services of Meade : " In 
the history of the wars of the United States, 
it does not appear that the nation ever profited 
by the services of any other army commander 
who combined thorough training with personal 
energy and skill on the battlefield as did Gen- 
eral Meade." That is a great verdict, and 
unless the whole structure of Mr. Pennypacker's 
book can be overthrown, it is a true one.

AN HISTORIAN OF IDEAS.* 



Mr. Leslie Stephen is an incomparable his- 
torian of ideas. His superb rationality and 
fair-mindedness give to his work in this kind 
a quality of finality and convincingness unat- 
tainable by more showy but less judicial writers. 
His services to English literature are generally 
acknowledged. But there is little recognition, 
on the part of professional students of philoso- 
phy, of the fact that his " Science of Ethics " 
is not only the best but the only logically cohe- 
rent presentation of the so-called Spencerian or

Evolutionary ethics. And nobody seems to 
have noticed that in his crushing reply to 
Huxley's Romanes lecture he fairly unseated 
in the open lists that redoubtable champion of 
controversy, the overthrower of dukes, bishops, 
and prime ministers. 

In response to a reviewer who had sharply 
taken him to task for his estimate of Buckle, 
Mr. Stephen modestly says that he himself 
could no more have written Buckle's book than 
he could have encountered him at chess. It 
may be so. But Buckle's book, for all his 
brilliance and masterly marshalling of facts, 
is full of things that are not so crotchets, 
fantastic hypotheses unverified and un verifiable, 
hasty generalizations and pseudo-scientific laws; 
while, humanly speaking, it will not be easy 
to find anything affirmed in the volumes of 
Mr. Stephen that is not substantially as he 
declares it to be. And this preeminent sanity 
is, after all, as rare a quality in literature as 
brilliancy, if not as genius. We shall quite as 
soon find another Buckle, another Macaulay, 
or even another Carlyle, as a literary man who, 
writing voluminously on a wide range of con- 
troverted ethical, critical, and philosophical 
questions, never permits himself an ignoratio 
elenchi, a flight of irrelevant rhetoric, an unfair 
use of ambiguous terms, or a misrepresentation 
of his opponent's thought, but always endeavors 
to bring out the aspect of truth aimed at by 
the doctrine or formula which he is controvert- 
ing, and who invariably qualifies the positive- 
ness of his assertions in exact proportion to 
the available evidence. 

These qualities revealed in Mr. Stephen's 
"English Thought in the Eighteenth Century," 
published in 1876, are now more maturely dis- 
played in a sequel to that work, just published, 
entitled "The English Utilitarians." The 
title does not quite do justice to the contents. 
" The English Utilitarians " suggests mainly, 
if not exclusively, the utilitarian theory of 
ethics and legislation. But in addition to this, 
Mr. Stephen has given us a history and criti- 
cism of the classical political economy, a close 
study of the associationist psychology in its 
relation to the Scottish philosophy of Reid, 
Stuart, and Hamilton, and a brief but extremely 
instructive sketch of the religious thought of 
the first half of the century. 

The work is not only broader, but more in- 
teresting, than the promise of its title. " Utili- 
tarianism," exclaims Matthew Arnold, " surely 
a pedant invented the word ; and oh, what 
pedants have been at work employing it." But

Mr. Stephen, though he aims at the enlighten- 
ment rather than the mere entertainment of 
his readers, possesses himself a sense of humor, 
and is keenly alive to the lack of it in his 
heroes. " Austin," he quietly observes, in ex- 
planation of the failure of the Lectures on 
Jurisprudence, " thought it a duty to be as dry 
as Bentham, and discharged the duty scrupu- 
lously." Mr. Stephen cannot accomplish the 
impossible. He cannot enliven Bentham, of 
whom Hazlitt said, " He writes a language of 
his own that darkens knowledge." He cannot 
make Malthas and Ricardo and Mill on Ham- 
ilton amusing to frivolous readers. But the 
present work has this advantage over its pre- 
decessor : that the leading ideas of which it 
treats still possess more than a merely historical 
interest. There is no such hopelessly arid and 
barren tract to be traversed as the exhaustive 
survey of the futile Deist controversy in the 
earlier work. Mr. Stephen has himself been 
a disciple of the doctrine which he interprets. 
He has lived through and assimilated the modi- 
fications which evolution, the new psychology, 
and the new erudition have necessitated in our 
apprehension of it. And his judicial and lucid 
exposition of all this enlists the thoughtful 
reader's attention and holds it to the end. 

These considerations enter especially into 
the review and estimate of the life-work of 
John Stuart Mill, which occupies the larger 
part of the third volume, and which no other 
living writer, with the possible exception of 
Mr. Morley, was so well qualified to execute. 
" What was there to find so mysteriously sig- 
nificant in Goethe, or in John Mill so full of 
weight ? " cries Professor James, lamenting 
the lost illusions of his youth. So it ever is. 
The new psychology and the new rhetoric can 
make nothing of the facts and the logic of yes- 
terday in their old-fashioned psychological 
garb. But however it may be in physics, in 
the mental and moral sciences there are a great 
many facts and relations which persist sub- 
stantially unaltered by new fashions in psychol- 
ogy. And there are a great many distinctions, 
classifications, and groupings, which conform 
to the experience and apprehensions of normal 
humanity, and so retain their validity, even 
after evolution has taught us the vanity of 
" natural kinds," and the new sociology has 
made us shy of dogmatizing about so complex 
a growth as the actual social structure. The 
logic, the political economy, and the review of 
Hamilton represent the highest development of 
rational thought about human conduct and the 



problems of philosophy in the England of fifty 
years ago. They require many qualifications 
to-day, a surprising number of which, however, 
were parenthetically anticipated, though not 
emphasized, by Mill himself. We are suffi- 
ciently aware of their limitations, and there is 
nothing to be learned from vague a priori de- 
preciation of them from repeating that Mal- 
thus has been refuted by the McCormick 
reaper, that the wage-fund is an illusion and 
the economic man is a fiction, or from point- 
ing out again that Mill was imperfectly ac- 
quainted with Kant, that he failed to anticipate 
evolution, and that he "opened a trap-door 
under the Utilitarian ethics " by admitting 
qualitative differences in pleasures. Those 
who fancy that they have outgrown Mill should 
re-read the essay on Bentham, that on Cole- 
ridge, that on the Conflict in America, and ask 
themselves where they can find to-day such 
wide and completely assimilated knowledge 
combined with such lucidity and precision of 
statement, so wfell defined and systematically 
applied a philosophy united with such sympa- 
thetic insight into the views of an opponent, 
such keen political sagacity accompanied by so 
strong an enthusiasm for humanity. The time 
for destructive criticism of Mill is past. The 
helpful thing would be, assuming the essential 
rationality of his point of view, to show just 
what modifications he himself would probably 
have made in his doctrines and formulas if he 
could have lived to share the wider outlook of 
our generation. It is precisely this that Mr. 
Stephen does, and does the more admirably 
because, as he repeatedly observes, he is not a 
specialist, is not greatly erudite in any of 
Mill's chief fields of thought unless it be in the 
theory of ethics. A professional economist 
would have taken us beyond our depth into the 
bog of the wage-fund and Malthusian contro- 
versies. Mr. Stephen clearly presents the real 
points at issue, and is careful not to carry the 
analysis beyond the point at which logomachy 
begins. Few specialists in logic or psychology 
would have possessed the self-restraint required 
to present, disengaged from all technical detail, 
the true significance of Mill's four methods 
and his doctrine of natural kinds ; and a " Kant 
philologist " would have fairly wallowed in the 
slough of misconceptions offered by the Mill- 
Hamilton controversy : whereas Mr. Stephen 
is content to mark the obvious limits of Mill's 
and Hamilton's knowledge of Kant, and to set 
forth lucidly the parts of Kant's doctrine that 
are relevant to the discussion. Hamilton him-

self is treated with greater severity and with less 
historical objectivity, perhaps, than any other 
writer discussed in these volumes. But the bub- 
ble of Hamilton's reputation still needed prick- 
ing, and the work is here done neatly and finally. 
The book, however, is by no means wholly 
devoted to these austere themes. The first 
half of Volume I. is occupied by a masterly 
introductory survey, social, political, economic, 
and literary, of English society at the close of 
the eighteenth century. The biographical 
sketches are executed with a skill that shows 
the practised hand of the editor of the Dic- 
tionary of National Biography. And though 
Mr. Stephen aims at lucidity and precision of 
style rather than picturesqueness, he not in- 
frequently carries precision and lucidity to the 
point where they have the effect of epigram. 
"Truisms," he tells us, "are required so long 
as self-contradictory propositions are accepted." 
" The doctrine of Sir William Hamilton has 
been so often lucidly expounded that it is hard 
to say what it means. " "What Kant precisely 
meant, or whether he had not various and in- 
consistent meanings, is happily a question 
beyond my purpose." Sociologists and psychol- 
ogists may meditate upon the following : " It 
is common enough to attempt to create a science 
by inventing technical terminology." To meta- 
physicians we may commend the definition that 
"a philosophy is a poetry stated in terms of 
logic." Some theologians may be interested 
in the allusion to those who infer that " opinions 
are confirmed because a non-natural interpre- 
tation can be forced upon them." The social- 
settlement young woman will have many 
searchings of heart when she reads that " it 
might almost seem that he [Bentham] rather 
valued the benevolent end because it gave em- 
ployment to his faculties, than valued the em- 
ployment because it led to the end." All 
system-mongers should incorporate the follow- 
ing in their system of logic : " If a system will 
work, the minutest details can be exhibited. 
Therefore, it is inferred, an exhibition of mi- 
nute detail proves that it will work." Lastly, 
we would inscribe in letters of gold in the 
faculty-room of every educational body that 
legislates for the ingenious youth of America 
these words of wisdom : " He seems to fall into 
the error, too common among legislative theo- 
rists, of assuming that an institution will be 
worked for the ends of the contriver, instead 
of asking to what ends it may be distorted by 
the ingenuity of all who can turn it to account 
for their own purposes." PAUL SHOREY. 



THE OLD NEW YORK FRONTIER.* 
From a time immemorial before the coming 
of the white man, Central New York was in 
possession of the Iroquois, a confederation of 
five Indian nations, to which was joined, in the 
year 1715, a Southern tribe, the Tuscaroras, 
who were driven from South Carolina by the 
English settlers. Thus was constituted what 
was afterward known as the famous Six Na- 
tions. They numbered about 12,000, and long 
before any contact with the whites had taken 
place they were in a semi-civilized condition, 
and became the most powerful of the Indian 
races on the continent, their sway extending 
west as far as the Mississippi and south to the 
confines of Mexico. They had a representative 
form of government, a national council, and, 
strange to say, their women were permitted to 
hold meetings and were often consulted in 
matters of importance. One of the names of 
the Six Nations meant in English the United 
People. They lived in cabins built of wood, 
and cultivated large fields of tobacco, corn, and 
other vegetables ; they were skilful in various 
kinds of handiwork, and built forts palisaded 
with logs, which were proof against the white 
man's fire-arms. 

The leadership of the Six Nations was, 
shortly after the outbreak of our Eevolutionary 
War, assigned by common consent and acclaim 
to Joseph Brant, known as the Great Captain, 
a distinction to which his birth as an Indian 
sachem, his military genius, and his command- 
ing and masterful personality fully entitled 
him. Then but little over thirty years of age, 
Brant, fitly characterized as " the most remark- 
able Indian known to history," was prepared 
to enter upon that career which has written 
his name indelibly upon many a blood-stained 
page in the annals of New York State. Waver- 
ing for a time as to which side he should take 
in the conflict between the mother-country and 
the colonies, his sense of loyalty to the King 
finally prevailed, a result to which a visit made 
just then to England, his cordial reception 
there, and his presentation at Court, no doubt 
largely contributed. The traits native to his 
race had in Brant been tempered by the mild- 
ness of his disposition and his Christian nur- 
ture in one of the missionary schools ; and the 
charges made against him during his lifetime, 
and repeated carelessly by writers since his

day, of needless brutality and ferocity in the 
Indian and Tory raids upon the defenceless 
border settlements, have been found on inves- 
tigation to be for the most part without foun- 
dation. 

By reason of its central position among the 
American colonies, the people of New York 
took a conspicuous part in the long and bloody 
strife maintained with such stubborn resistance 
and unflinching valor, within and upon its 
borders, in the French and Indian Wars and 
during the Revolution. The Old Frontier of 
New York was that established by the treaty 
of Fort Stanwix, made by Sir William Johnson 
with the Iroquois in 1768. It conveyed to the 
English not only large parts of New York, but 
parts also of Kentucky, West Virginia, and 
Pennsylvania. The amount paid in money for 
this imperial domain was something over 
$50,000. That section of this historic line 
lying within New York State extended from 
Fort Stanwix, near Oneida Lake, in a nearly 
straight course and a southerly direction to the 
head-waters of the Delaware. 

The beautiful region known as the Susque- 
hanna Valley was visited by a few adventurous 
Dutchmen from Albany in the prosecution of 
their business as fur-traders, as early as 1614, 
several years before the arrival of the Pilgrims 
at Plymouth. These were followed not long 
after by a number of Jesuit priests, who had 
penetrated the wilderness, coming from New 
France, with the view of converting the savages. 
Early in the eighteenth century there was a 
large influx of Palatines from Germany on 
their way to Pennsylvania, many of them, how- 
ever, stopping in the Valley and becoming 
permanent residents there. At about the same 
time there arrived a company of Church of 
England men, sent out to propagate the Gospel 
in the New World, and some Non-conformist 
ministers from New England, who built chapels 
and established schools, in one of which Joseph 
Brant was educated. This missionary feature 
of our colonization is one to which hitherto 
little importance has been attached by histo- 
rians ; indeed, very little has been known of it. 
Mr. Halsey has, in the present work, given to 
it much deserved prominence. 

The Palatines settled upon lands in the Mo- 
hawk and Schoharie Valleys, where they con- 
stituted the bulk of the white population ; 
while the Scotch-Irish, coming over in great 
numbers from about 1720 (some 30,000, it is 
stated, crossing the Atlantic within two years), 
planted themselves along the upper waters of 



the Susquehanna. From this stock came some 
of the most distinguished of the Revolutionary 
Generals, Henry Knox, John Stark, An- 
thony W r ayne, and the Clintons. " It was the 
men in these frontier communities, Palatine, 
Scotch-Irish, and Dutch," says Mr. Halsey, 
that " bore the shock of war when the conflict 
with England began. It was they who became 
patriots to a man ; it was the houses and crops 
of these which were burned; it was they who 
were murdered or made prisoners." Of these 
men, the Scotch-Irish were perhaps the greatest 
sufferers. Living as they were at the outpost 
of civilization, in towns sparsely settled and 
remote from other settlements, and with little 
hope of relief from any of Washington's forces, 
dependent entirely upon their own untrained 
militia, " it was upon them that the Indians 
and their Tory allies in the Border Wars were 
the first to fall, and it was their lands alone 
that became entirely depopulated." When 
peace was established, in 1783, many of those 
who had survived the massacres of Cobleskill, 
Springfield, German Flatts, and Cherry Valley, 
returned to their old homes in the Mohawk 
and Schoharie Valleys ; while emigrants from 
New England came in numbers to the lands 
about the upper Susquehanna, from which the 
Scotch-Irish, Palatine, and other pioneers had 
been driven, virtually dominating from that 
time Central and Western New York. 

This border warfare has invested that entire 
region with as much romance and legend and 
tradition as ever existed on the Scottish border, 
and forming quite as good material for song 
and story. The wonder is that so little use of 
this material has been made ; for, save for some 
county histories, some historical monographs, 
like W. L. Stone's admirable Life of Joseph 
Brant, for example, and a number of unim- 
portant works of fiction, only gleanings from 
this rich field have as yet been made. One 
reason for this is that many of the chronicles 
of that period, published early in this past cen- 
tury, have long been out of print, and that a 
store of precious papers, letters, diaries, etc., 
has been lying in State archives, and in libra- 
ries, public and private, much of it until re- 
cently inaccessible, or reposing undisturbed 
owing to the languid interest felt in its subject- 
matter. 

The story of the tragedies enacted in the 
Susquehanna and Mohawk Valleys during the 
Revolution and of the frightful sufferings and 
privations of the people, almost unexampled in 
the annals of Indian warfare, has now for the

reared in the region which he describes, the 
author of this work has had good opportunities 
for becoming familiar with its localities and 
traditions, as well as for gaining access to 
documentary material, and he has availed him- 
self of these opportunities with rare judgment 
and discretion, and in the true historic spirit. 
His difficulty seems to have been that of selec- 
tion ; and the one regret awaiting the reader 
of these fascinating pages is that the writer 
felt compelled to compress into one volume 
what might have been readily and justifiably 
expanded into two or more. Of such signifi- 
cance were the events transpiring in that for- 
mative period in our Empire State, and so 
many were the personages of more or less dis- 
tinction who took part in them, that the space 
to which Mr. Halsey has modestly confined 
himself is scarcely adequate for their effective 
setting forth. He is entitled to great praise 
for the completion of this illuminating record,

such vivid colors, of those

ATTEMPTS AT SOCIAL, ETHICS.* 



Most men are not aware of the reasons of their 
conduct, because they have not formed the habit of 
critical reflection. Instincts, traditions, unconscious 
imitation of our neighbors, take care of action, im- 
pel to unthinking deeds, and form standards of social 
judgment. But when the custom is challenged or 
the institution is assailed by discontented persons, 
a community must either suppress criticism or rea- 
son with the rebels. The disciples of T. H. Green

make their appeal to the universal reason which is 
operative in each man, and which carries with it 
principles of right and justice. It is inevitable that 
they should seek to apply these transcendental prin- 
ciples to social institutions. 

Thus, the starting-point of Mr. Willoughby's 
treatise on " Social Justice " is in the initial sen- 
tence : " Ideals of right constitute the essentially 
active principles in our social and political life." 
But abstract ideas cannot be applied directly to an 
unknown situation. " What is right or wrong for 
us as members of a society can be determined only 
after we have ascertained all the circumstances 
which have led to a given state of affairs, as well 
as the conditions by which a given line of conduct 
is to be influenced in the future. This will mean 
that at least a certain amount of study of actual 
social conditions is imperative upon everyone, and 
especially upon those who would seek to teach or 
guide others. The study of the social sciences will 
thus be shown to be, as it were, a propaedeutic to 
the science of right living." There is a much easier 
and more direct path to subjective certainty, the 
way of deduction from one's own preferences, class 
prejudices, inherited beliefs and instincts, or popular 
ideas. But subjective certainty, while very enjoy- 
able, is not communicable and transferable, and 
cannot be made the basis of scientific investigation 
or of associated action in a self-governing commu- 
nity. A multitude of vociferating orators, all shout- 
ing their subjective certainties at once in full cry, 
simply drown each other's sentences. Reason is 
social, and it renders its verdicts only to those who 
patiently consider all factors. It is in this spirit 
we are asked to consider justice, equality, property, 
distributive justice, the right of coercion, the ethics 
of competition and punishment. " All we can say 
all that any ethical teacber can say is that, in 
each instance where an act is required, one must 
examine it as to all its possible results, proximate 
and ultimate, objective and subjective, and then ask 
himself whether the given line of conduct is more 
calculated than any other possible line of conduct 
to advance the world toward the realization of the 
highest ethical perfection." If this programme is 
carried out we shall find that the pseudo-science 
called " Social Ethics " will become a practical 
sociology based on induction, and no longer a series 
of vague deductions from assumed premises. For 
emphasizing this conclusion, the author of " Social 
Justice " deserves praise.

cial Problem," brings into the camp of the socio- 
logists his criticism against economics, or, rather, 
against the claim of political economy to furnish 
society with principles for guidance in conduct. 
He writes with a serious purpose and with remark- 
able power. At times he seems to be carrying us 
bodily over to Socialism, for he regards it as nec- 
essary to social progress that all monopolistic en- 
terprises be taken over by city, commonwealth, or 
nation. But he stops short of Marxism, and proves 
that there will still remain large room for private 
capital and individual enterprise in the occupations 
which have an artistic element and cannot be served 
by machinery on a large scale. With increasing 
taste and wealth there will be an enlarged demand 
for articles made to order, and on these monopoly 
cannot lay its hands. The abuses of parasitic 
wealth are described in terms which remind us of 
Veblen's "Theory of the Leisure Classes," while 
the misery of penury is painted in vivid contrast 
with luxury paid for from unearned income. The 
paradox of the " glut " is traced to this cause. 
Millions are ready to work and buy at the moment 
when the " captains of industry " confess their in- 
ability to keep factories open on account of " over- 
production." The purchasing power is in the hands 
of those who already have excessive wealth, and 
the others cannot furnish custom for the merchants. 
The remedy proposed by Mr. Hobson is to turn the 
unearned income into the public treasury by social- 
izing monopolistic industries. When wealth is 
diffused there will be no lack of purchasers and 
consumers. Yet there is real danger of over- 
population. Mr. Hobson admits the current teaching, 
and faces the consequences as Plato did. He frankly 
says that if people are paid " according to their 
needs " they may multiply more rapidly than their 
wants can be met. Legal restrictions on marriage 
will become necessary. Our school-teachers will 
find a theme for a quarrel in the author's reaction- 
ary statement that government schools cannot lead 
in the most inventive and original methods. Free 
schools can render a good service by giving the 
elements of instruction in a mechanical way, but 
cannot equal private schools in trying useful experi- 
ments in method. It is useless to attempt in brief 
space a criticism of this thought-provoking and 
stimulating book. It will arouse opposition, but it 
will give the most hostile readers food for reflection. 
If people were as quickly moved by reason as by 
immediate interests, or even if the business world 
read books at all, this volume would win a place in 
the libraries of men of affairs. 

Passing to the thick volume on Temperance Re- 
form, by Mr. Ronntree and Mr. Sherwell, we dis- 
cover the influence of the idea that a rational rule 
of conduct can be discovered only by an induction 
of all the factors which bear on the subject, causa- 
tive and regulative. We confront the appalling 
results of the use of intoxicants upon health, eco- 
nomic well-being, education, and political integrity. 
Then the various methods of reducing the evils are 



carefully and fully presented, prohibitory legisla- 
tion, local option, high license, government spirit 
monopoly, the dispensary system, the Gothenburg 
method, and finally an estimate of the relative 
place and value of all these methods. While some 
sources of information in relation to this country 
seem to have been overlooked, the work will be 
found a convenient manual, sane, conservative, and 
persuasive. 

" Josiah Flynt" has succeeded in making urban 
police authorities very angry with him, and his 
descriptions of the alliance of the Upper and Under 
Worlds, as given in his " Notes of an Itinerant 
Policeman " and " The Powers that Prey," are not 
pleasant reading to those who value serenity of 
mind above public security and purity. While there 
is a tendency to strong and vivid statement, the 
stories of this expert tramp are too minute and 
circumstantial to ignore. Occasional revelations of 
investigating committees, reporters, and grand 
juries tend to confirm the impression that there is 
very much truth in the charge that many of those 
who are paid by a heavily-taxed society to protect 
it are in the habit of adding to their income by 
levying assessments on criminals. Those citizens 
who indulge the fancy that all goes well without 
zealous and vigilant effort may be startled from 
their moral somnolence by these vigorous and pic- 
turesque sketches. 

Two local studies of the Jewish population of 
London, by Mr. C. Russell and Mr. H. S. Lewis, 
are of interest in several American cities, because 
the immigration of Jews from Russia has aggravated 
our municipal difficulties, at least temporarily, to a 
very serious degree. It is not easy for people of 
different race and religious education to cooperate 
economically and politically until the process of 
spiritual assimilation has made considerable ad- 
vance. Mr. Russell does not agree with Mr. Lewis 
in all his conclusions, and it must for some time 
remain an open question whether the Jewish popu- 
lation can ever learn to draw near to the religions 
life of other peoples. But it seems to be clear that 
in a tolerant community they can thrive without 
disturbing the economic progress of the earlier oc- 
cupants of the territory, since the Jews are eager 
to rise in pecuniary power and social consideration, 
and they will not passively accept a low standard 
of life if by any means they can improve their lot. 

Count Tolstoy pours out a wide if somewhat thin 
stream of pathetic description and emotional appeal 
on behalf of some vague scheme of reversion to 
agricultural life, in his book entitled " The Slavery 
of Our Times." A student of social reform cannot 
help sympathizing with the Russian's moral earnest- 
ness and boundless pity for those who suffer. But 
the gross misrepresentation of classic economics, 
the reactionary ideals, the utterly visionary pro- 
gramme, become very wearisome after one has read 
several volumes of these harangues. If the public 
could only take the good Count as an artist, and 
ignore him as an economist, he might do good ;

but his fascination as a story-teller confuses the 
intellect and puts the critical faculty off its guard. 
The only antidote for illogical and untrue repre- 
sentations by economists is a careful study of their 
strongest works. But it is a good deal easier to 
read tirades and gloomy word-pictures than to fol- 
low scientific processes, and so we must expect to 
learn that " The Slavery of Our Times " will be 
placed on the shelf with Adam Smith and Francis 
Walker in many libraries, and be read while the 
masters of the science are honored by title. But 
facts and science will, after all, have their way, and 
fiction will take its proper place as a stimulant. 
Meantime, the plea for universal peace deserves a 
hearing on its own account, and no hater of hateful 
war can wish Count Tolstoy to be silent on that 
subject, even if his artistic temperament prevents 
him from being exact on any subject. 

The author of " Commerce and Christianity " 
assumes that Socialism has made out its case : that 
the sole business of the Church is to provide a pulpit 
for its doctrines and a ritual for its praise: and 
that the future existence of all ecclesiastical organi- 
zations depends on their becoming teachers of eco- 
nomics of this particular type. What would remain 
for religious institutions to do if Socialism were 
adopted this year, the author seems not to have 
considered. 

A very attractive and appetizing programme is 
suggested by the title "Our Nation's Need; or, 
Let us all Divide Up and Start Even." Those who 
desire to read what a very amiable person has to 
say on Communism may thank us for calling at- 
tention by this brief note to the little volume. 

In " Restraint of Trade " Mr. Harper has col- 
lected and arranged in convenient form a great 
many opinions on the subject of trusts. Critical 
treatment is not to be expected in a compilation, 
and there is here no attempt at an organic connec- 
tion of the material ; yet in spite of this fact the 
book will be found for some purposes quite conven- 
ient for reference. 

The modern tendency to make the church as 
useful as possible in ministering to human needs is 
illustrated by the brief monograph prepared for the 
Department of Social Economy at the Paris Expo- 
sition of 1890. While it is by no means exhaustive 
in its treatment of " Religious Movements for Social 
Betterment," the illustrations selected are taken 
from some of the most important efforts of the 
kind, and their significance in the history of Chris- 
tian civilization is intelligently interpreted.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The Reformer Heroes of the Reformation " 

of German series (Putnam) we now have a new 

life, by Dr. Samuel M. Jackson, of 
Huldreich Zwingli, the Reformer of German Switz- 
erland. If the author had " tried to be impartial " 
with somewhat less zeal, it might have been better 
for his work. We may fairly question whether one 
who writes the biography of a " Hero of the Refor- 
mation " should pride himself on having " avoided 
eulogy." It is a book of so much information and 
such rich pictorial equipment that one regrets the 
pervading consciousness that care was being taken 
by Professor Jackson not to forget that Zwingli 
must be kept in a rank below Luther. And this 
care is the less warranted in view of the admission 
in the Preface : " If the four great continental re- 
formers Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli, and Cal- 
vin should appear to-day, the one among them 
who would have to do least to adapt himself to our 
modern ways of thought, and the man who would 
soonest gather an enthusiastic following, would be 
Huldreich Zwingli." Which seems very like an 
admission that Zwingli was the most liberal and 
progressive of the four, as he probably was. He 
had faults enough. But is it sufficient reason for 
denying him an equality with Luther, that " in his 
treatment of the Baptists he was prejudiced and 
cruel, his literary work is marred by haste, his 
jealousy of Luther was a mark of weakness, and in 
the latter part of his life he was more of a politician 
than he should have been"? Could not similar 
and more severe things be said of Luther and Cal- 
vin ? It has happened that Luther and Calvin 
became the founders of greater organizations, and 
are better known to the world than Zwingli. But 
circumstances, notably political and linguistic con- 
ditions, did much for the success of Luther's mission. 
After reading the excellent resumS of Zwingli's 
theology in Professor Foster's supplementary chap- 
ter, the reader is inclined to regret that Zwingli's 
views were not the ones to make the deepest im- 
pression on Europe. Zwingli was, all in all, a more 
admirable person, a man more after our modern 
hearts, than Luther. But the straining out of the 
historical background in a preliminary chapter, and 
of Zwingli's theology in a supplementary chapter, 
together with the anxious abstinence from eulogy, 
have made the account cold and unsympathetic, 
though withal valuable. Professor Vincent's survey 
of the condition of Switzerland at the beginning of 
the sixteenth century is of itself excellent, and the 
fine press-work and the thirty-three half-tone illus- 
trations add greatly to the pleasure of the reader. 

An important aid Professor Titchener, the well-known 
to the teaching psychologist of Cornell University, 
of Psychology. hag comp i e ted the first portions of 
his laboratory manual on " Experimental Psychol- 
ogy " (Macmillan), and is to be congratulated upon 
the successful issue of a laborious and none too

exhilarating task. The volumes furnish an addi- 
tional evidence of the serious purpose and scientific 
depth of the experimental methods as applied to 
the problems of psychology, and no less of the close 
relations between the pursuit of the fundamental 
mental problems by other and more historic meth- 
ods. The method is here wisely subordinated to the 
end, without sacrificing precision, and yet without 
distorting the essential nature of the subject- 
material. To the small literature of distinctly 
pedagogical aids to laboratory psychology, this 
manual comes as a very weighty contribution and 
one destined to influence in no slight measure the 
progress of the teaching of psychology in the uni- 
versities of the country. Like all such volumes, 
what is offered will be more available to one instruc- 
tor than to another ; and each must choose and 
adapt and cut his garment according to his cloth. 
Yet the advantage of a trustworthy and expert 
guide in an intricate and somewhat unexplored 
country is unmistakable, though the ultimate 
success of the expedition will depend upon the tact 
and insight and ingenuity of the user of the guide. 
Professor Titchener offers a guide both for the 
teacher and the taught. The two volumes are in 
reality independent works, and the ground covered 
by the instructor's manual is more extensive and 
more thoroughly explored than the general outline 
for the students. The former makes possible the 
training of advanced students in an apprenticeship 
to their specialty. Together, the present volumes 
contain the qualitative parts of the work, and will 
be followed in good season by a complementary 
portion treating of the quantitative methods and 
the problems to which they are applicable. There 
is much originality in the plan and in the mode of 
its execution ; yet the test of time and experience 
will be necessary to prove the applicability of these 
volumes to actual needs. Their scholarship, origi- 
nality, and grasp of the problems treated is sufficient 
to bespeak for them a favorable reception among 
the group of special teachers of psychology for 
whom they are primarily intended. 

The Life of William Pitt, Lord 
StfSSL. Chatham, by Mr. Walford Davis 

Green, appears in the " Heroes of 
the Nations " series (Putnam). None of the biog- 
raphies thus far issued in this series (except natur- 
ally those of Lincoln, Grant, Lee, and Columbus) 
should command a keener interest among American 
readers than this story of the Great Commoner, 
whose career was so closely connected with the 
colonial expansion of Great Britain, and " whose 
name was as beloved in America as it was feared 
in Europe." Mr. Green's narrative is of course 
rapid and condensed ; but he allows himself con- 
siderable detail in recounting the events of the four 
memorable years from 1757 to 1761, when Pitt's 
war ministry " raised Great Britain from despond- 
ency to the position of first nation in the world," 
and when " from a condition of lethargy and COn- 



.FGr tludentt 
of Shakttptart 
and of law. 



fusion her army and navy had been urged to victory 
after victory in three continents and on every ocean." 
The sub-title " Growth and Division of the British 
Empire " suggests that later period in Chatham's 
career when he tried in vain to shape the Govern- 
ment's policy toward its revolting colonies into 
something like justice and conciliation. No true 
American can read without emotion, or can ever 
forget, the burning, passionate words with which he 
pleaded for fairness toward the kin beyond sea. 
"Chatham's insight into the American character 
was the outcome of deep affection and sympathy ; 
to him they were not 'our subjects,' but Englishmen 
who still loved the tones of that deep chord which 
Hampden smote, they were ewes Romani, men of 
the true race, of like faith and passions with him- 
self. ' There,' he wrote of America, ' there where 
I had garnered up my heart' " Mr. Green's clear 
and sympathetic narrative admirably supplements 
the previous Chatham literature which consisted 
mainly of Francis Thackeray's " History of William 
Pitt" (1827), Macaulay's famous essay, and the 
four volumes of Correspondence issued by the ex- 
ecutors of the younger Pitt. 

Lovers of Shakespeare's dramatic 
writings, and those who delight to 
trace the history of the struggle over 
the jurisdiction of equity between the courts of 
chancery and those of the common law, will read 
with more than usual interest the Hon. Charles E. 
Phelps's " Falstaff and Equity, an Interpretation " 
(Houghton). Taking as his text the words used 
by Falstaff in the second scene of the second act of 
I. Henry IVi, " An the Prince and Poins be not 
two arrant cowards, there 's no equity stirring," 
Judge Phelps undertakes to explain a joke in a 
manner which gives it new point and added signifi- 
cance. In doing this, he is induced to investigate 
the records at Stratford-on-Avon, and particularly 
the court records in which the Shakespeares 
father, mother, and son William figure promi- 
nently ; and from them he is able to show, in a 
convincing manner, some of the crudities of judicial 
procedure in Shakespeare's time, and out of the 
experiences of this litigation to account for the re- 
mark, " There 's no equity stirring," which is put 
into Falstaff's month at an opportune moment, 
designed doubtless as a " gag," but involving also 
a nice criticism on the English courts in the admin- 
istration of justice. The discussion by Judge Phelpa 
is clear and masterful. His argument is original, 
and shows painstaking investigation and careful 
research. His contentions are copiously fortified 
with footnote references which, to students of 
Shakespeare and of the law, give to the volume be- 
fore us additional value. An appendix gives the 
record evidence of the Shakespeare litigation re- 
ferred to in the text ; and reference is also made, 
chronologically, to the war between the courts. The 
book is a valuable contribution to the subjects to 
which it relates.

THE DIAL 



[June 16, 



The Diplomacy The " Pickett Papers," made famous 
of the Southern in 1872 by their purchase from the 
Confederacy. Confederate general of that name 
for the " Rebel Archives " of the United States, 
have found a use in addition to their regular service 
of saving the government money in settling war 
claims. Dr. James Martin Callahan has made them 
a basis for a " Diplomatic History of the Southern 
Confederacy " (The Johns Hopkins Press). Being 
prepared primarily as a course of university lec- 
tures, the matter is tersely written, closely based 
on original material, and replete with references. 
The sad chronicle of the high hopes with which 
the Confederacy entered upon its task of securing 
the aid of England and France, and the delay and 
disappointment which it finally met with, is made 
out in a kindly spirit from the documents and let- 
ters. One follows the alternating despair and hope 
of its representatives abroad, and sees each feeling 
reflected in the officials at home. " The bane and 
curse of carrying out anything in this country," 
writes Thompson of " Northern city-burning" fame, 
from Canada, " is the surveillance under which we 
act. Detectives stand at every corner." The author, 
in the few places in which he allows himself to in- 
trude personal opinion into the mass of evidence, 
thinks that the common people in England could 
not be won to support the Confederacy, notwith- 
standing the cotton famine, because they were 
irrevocably opposed to slavery ; that Davis and the 
other leaders would have been willing to sacrifice 
slavery at last to gain England, but it was too late ; 
that Napoleon used duplicity toward the Confede- 
racy's representatives ; and that the second election 
of Lincoln blasted whatever hopes of foreign aid 
the cause might have previously entertained. In 
addition to its occupying a new field, this history is 
a scholarly and trustworthy production. 

Another book by Mr. Cyrus Town- 
8end Brady gives us a sheaf of the 
author's personal experiences by 
land and sea, grouped under the title of " Under 
Tops'ls and Tents" (Scribner). From the Auto- 
biographical Note prefixed to the volume it appears 
that Mr. Brady has been what may fairly be termed 
an "all-round man." He has been in the Navy 
and in the Army ; he has been in the " railroad 
business " and in the Church ; he is now " in litera- 
ture," and there is no telling where he will turn up 
next. Mr. Brady's pen has been very busy for the 
past twelvemonth, but there is no sign as yet of 
flagging forces or a depleted literary exchequer. A 
fine flow of spirits and a manifest relish of his own 
good stories is as apparent in his latest book as in 
his first. Of course we do not mean to say that 
Mr. Brady is a mere jester, for there is pathos as 
well as mirth in the best of his stories a reflection 
of life's April weather. The contents of the present 
volume are divided under such headings as " Where 
Admirals Are Made," " Out With the United States 
Volunteers," and " Stories of Army and Navy Life." 



Essentially the book is a reflection of the author's 
experiences as a naval cadet at Annapolis and on 
the school-ships, and as a chaplain in camp and at 
the front during the war with Spain. Mr. Brady 
turns the kaleidoscope of memory with pleasing 
and often dramatic effect, and his stories are sweet- 
ened by the suggestion of the humane and cheery 
personality behind them. 



A picture of 
Napoleon at 
St. Helena. 



Lord Rosebery's " Napoleon, the 
Last Phase " (Harper) is a brilliant 
presentation of the great prisoner 
in exile. The author spares no pains to get at the 
facts of those strange years. He takes up the 
Napoleonic literature which grew out of those last 
days, and subjects it to the sharpest criticism. The 
chronicles of Las Cases, O'Meara, Antommarchi, 
Gourgand, Lady Malcolm, and all the rest of them, 
are critically examined. In fact, this is one of the 
great points of the book. After the sources have 
been thus carefully weighed and the chaff blown 
out of them, Lord Rosebery gives us a very dis- 
criminating estimate of Napoleon in his strange 
environment on that lone isle. He presents a study 
of the gradual pining away of the high mental and 
physical strength of Napoleon, and leaves the facts 
in such form that every reader can paint his own 
picture, not only of the external conditions at 
Longwood, but of what was passing in the mind of 
the dethroned exile. Lord Rosebery does not spare 
the petty English governor of the island, nor does 
he seem to show favoritism toward anything but 
the truth. In the final summing up of Napoleon 
and Democracy (p. 237), the author says: "Au- 
thoritative democracy, or, in other words, demo- 
cratic dictatorship, the idea which produced the 
Second Empire in France, which is still alive there, 
and which, in various forms, has found favor else- 
where, is the political legacy, perhaps the final 
message, of Napoleon." 

Greek marbles Few books seem destined to greater 
pictured and usefulness than those composing the 

interpreted. u R i verside Art Seriea (Roughton), 

and Miss Estelle M. Kuril's " Greek Sculpture, a 
Collection of Sixteen Pictures of Greek Marbles, 
with Introduction and Interpretation " has just the 
felicity of treatment, between erudition and popu- 
larity, which has made the other volumes of the 
series so generally valuable. The statues selected 
for discussion stand for definite periods in Greek 
art and its later Roman adaptations, and are illus- 
trated by photographs from sources of undoubted 
authenticity. Each is interpreted historically, and, 
so far as possible, by extracts from classical litera- 
ture Homer most of all. The interpretations 
are unforced, reasonable, and convincing, being 
kept well within the knowledge of the unlearned, 
and simple enough for children quite unskilled in 
myth and fable. All the more familiar examples 
of Greek art are included, with the exception of the 
Diana of the Louvre, and several not so generally

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Numbers 15 to 25, inclusive, of the " Home and 
School Classics " published by the Messrs. Heath have 
recently come to hand. They include the regular fort- 
nightly issues to the end of last December, and the first 
number of the new monthly series begun in March of 
the present year. Among the titles are the " Comedy 
of Errors " and the " Winter's Tale," edited by Mrs. 
Sarah Willard Hiestand, Miss Mulock's "The Lame 
Little Prince," Miss Martineau's " The Crofton Boys," 
" The Siege of Leyden," from Motley's " Dutch Repub- 
lic," and " Tales from Munchausen," edited by the Rev. 
Edward Everett Hale. This is good literature for 
children, and is reproduced in so inexpensive a form 
that it may be readily used in schools. 

" The Working Principles of Rhetoric," by Professor 
John F. Genung, has been published by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. It is described as " a restndied and repropor- 
tioned treatise " based upon the author's earlier " Prac- 
tical Elements of Rhetoric." Teachers of the subject 
who like a book so large that their students can delve 
into it, rather than attempt to work through it system- 
atically, will be delighted with this book of nearly seven 
hundred pages, which contains everything that could 
reasonably be asked for in such a treatise, and which 
comes with the authority of so veteran a teacher and 
maker of text-books.

is a useful manual for teachers just published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" A Text-Book of Astronomy," by Professor George 
C. Comstock, is an addition to the " Twentieth Century " 
series of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. The illustrations 
provided for this work are exceptionally attractive. 

Three books of " Chatty Readings in Elementary 
Science," for very young readers, are published by

New York by Judge W. W. Goodrich. It is now pub- 
lished as a small book by Messrs. E. B. Treat & Co. 
There are four portraits. 

Charles Kingsley's "Perseus" makes a charming 
gift book for a child in the form just given it by Mr. 
R. H. Russell. A delicate frontispiece drawing, large 
type, and neat gray board covers are the distinguishing 
features of this issue of the familiar juvenile classic. 

Mr. R. H. Russell publishes a new edition of Mr. 
William Young's " Wishmakers* Town," which first 
appeared in 1885. A letter written many years ago to 
the author by Mr. R. H. Davis, and a special preface 
by Mr. T. B. Aldrich are the notable features of this 
new edition. 

Messrs. W. H. Lowdermilk & Co., Washington, pub- 
lish " The Songs of Alcseus " in an edition prepared by

sketched against the background of the great pine 
forests of northern Michigan. 

"Logic; or, the Analytic of Explicit Reasoning," by 
Mr. George H. Smith, is a recent publication of Messrs. 
G. P. Putnam's Sons. The special plea of the author 
is that logic should deal with the matter of thought no 
less than with the form, and that, thus considered, it is 
the very foundation of rational education. 

" Victoria, Maid Matron Monarch," by " Grapho " 
(J. A. Adams), is a readable sketch, full of anecdote 
and personal chat, of the late Queen of England. The 
author's style, if rather slipshod, is lively and graphic, 
and he has a good notion of the sort of mental pabulum 
the general reader likes. (Advance Publishing Co.,

BOOKS THAT INCREASE IN VALUE 

One does not buy books as an investment, but it is pleasant to feel that what 
one does buy holds its value. Those who buy publications bearing the imprint of 
GEORGE BARRIE & SON are certain of this ; and in numerous cases have realized 
unearned increment. A case in point : at a recent London sale a portfolio of illus- 
trations which accompanied a set of their edition of HUGO brought 40 ; more than 
the original subscriber paid for the entire set and the portfolio.
