GEORGE DU MAURIER'S LAST NOVEL 

THE MARTIAN 

READY JULY 1. 

Profusely Illustrated by the Author. Post 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental, price $1.75 ; Three-quarter Calf, 

$3.50 ; Three-quarter Crushed Levant, $4.50. A Glossary of the French expressions is included. 

He has an irresistible theme, and he writes irresistibly. All the quiet charm of " Peter Ibbetson " comes 

back to the reader as he opens the October Harper's at the page where " The Martian " begins, and not even 

the imperishable Paris of " Trilby " has a sweeter glamour than that which is thrown over the Paris of these 

opening chapters. . . . 

The romance has the ring of Mr. Du Maurier's best romancing; the simple, almost nai've, admiration of 
the boys for Barty shows the author as we have known him in his highest estate, true, wise, free from the 
slightest suspicion of sentimentality or cant. " The Martian " opens again the portals of his delightful world, 
the story revives the tenderness, the sweetness, the original magic which many readers have feared could 
never be re-captured, and the four or five pictures reveal unmistakably the same hand that wrought the text.

Mr. Crawford is, as ANDREW LANG says, " the most versatile and various of modern novelists. ... A master of the 
narrative style, he throws a subtle charm over all he touches." Mr. Allen, also, so Bliss Carman writes, is " one of the first 
of our novelists to-day," with " a prose style of wonderful beauty," while Mrs. Steel's new book is described as " a piece of 
evenly brilliant writing."

Each of these volumes is a picture of life in one section of the country, very successful in preserving the local atmosphere. 
As the Detroit Free Press says of the tales of Puget Sound, " there is not a dull story in the book." To Mr. Johnston we 
owe the permanent possession of a view of life which now belongs to a vanished past.

" Not only is his treatment of the great thesis which he has undertaken to discuss fresh and suggestive, but he shows 
himself to be a clear and original thinker. ... In luminous and epigramatic statement, in compactness of thought, and in a 
thorough mastery of the whole subject, he ranks among the best writers on sociology who have appeared during the last 
twenty years, and we believe his book will come to be recognized as one of the most valuable and helpful treatises in the lan- 
guage." The Tribune, New York.

A JUBILEE RETROSPECT. 

The recent celebration of the longest reign in 
English history has naturally called forth a 
great quantity of retrospective writing, and the 
history of progress during the sixty years of the 
Victorian period has been discussed in all of 
its aspects. In such a review of an eventful 
term of years, the history of literature neces- 
sarily plays a considerable part, and, in this 
case, the delimitation of a period by the dates 
of a reign is somewhat less arbitrary and arti- 
ficial than it is in others. It has often been 
pointed out that the Victorian age is one of the 
most distinctly defined in English literary his- 
tory, and it seems as certain as anything of the 
sort reasonably can be that the term " Victor- 
ian " will become as fixed a thing in our literary 
annals as the term " Elizabethan " has been for 
the past two centuries. In point of fact, as 
every student knows, the former term is a better 
fit than the latter ; for what we call Victorian 
literature really belongs to the reign of the 
present Queen, while a large part of what is 
commonly called Elizabethan is, strictly speak- 
ing, Jacobean, being seventeenth-century work. 
Mr. Saintsbury goes so far as to reckon Milton 
and his contemporaries within the Elizabethan 
period, and it is hardly probable that future 
historians will call Victorian the poets (if there 
are any) of the next mid-century. 

Perhaps the most astonishing reflection sug- 
gested by the subject of the Jubilee is that when 
Victoria came to the throne in 1837, Goethe 
and Scott had been dead only five years. The 
mood of Browning's question, " Did you once 
see Shelley plain ? " comes upon us when we 
realize that there must be a number of people 
living to-day who have seen and spoken with 
the poet at Weimar or with the novelist at 
Abbotsford, and that the reign of one monarch 
stretches back from the present year to a time 
when the loss of those two men was still fresh 
in the heart. They seem in so many ways so 
immeasurably remote from us even if we 
have taken from them daily inspiration all our 
lives long that it is difficult to imagine a 
time when men felt about them as we of to-day 
feel, for example, about Tennyson and Renan. 
When we note, also, that Coleridge and Lamb 
had died in 1834, and that, in the very year 



6 



THE DIAL 



[July l, 



of Her Majesty's coronation, the fatal bullet 
had sped to Puskin's heart, while Leopardi 
had dashed himself to death against the 
prison-bars of an existence that ever seemed 
to him intolerable, the mood of retrospection 
becomes deepened in us, and we wonder that 
such " far-off things " can thus be linked with 
our own lives. 

We often speak of " books of the year." Let 
us see what these books were in the year of 
grace 1837. In poetry, there was Browning's 
" Strafford," which had already been preceded 
by " Pauline " and " Paracelsus," but the poet 
had not yet found his audience, and was des- 
tined to wait for a full generation before tak- 
ing his place in the temple of fame. In fiction, 
Bulwer's " Ernest Maltravers " appeared, and 
strengthened the hold upon the public already 
secured by " Rienzi," " The Last Days of Pom- 
peii," and eight or nine other novels. Far 
more popular than these works, however, were 
the productions of a young writer known as 
"Boz," who had published his famous 
" Sketches " the year before, and who, in the 
year of the coronation, completed the immortal 
"Pickwick," and began the publication of 
" Oliver Twist." In this year, also, Disraeli 
published "Venetian," and stood midway in his 
flamboyant career as a writer of fiction. As for 
Thackeray, his first serious appearance in lit- 
erature dates from this same year, with the 
publication of " The Yellowplush Papers." The 
more solid " books of the year " were Whewell's 
" History of the Inductive Sciences," Hallam's 
" Literature of Europe," Lockhart's biography 
of Scott, and Carlyle's " French Revolution," 
at last rewritten after the heartbreaking destruc- 
tion of its first draft. When we bring together 
these titles that mean so much to the student of 
English literature, we cannot help wondering 
whether any books of pure literature produced 
in the year 1897 will stand as high "sixty 
years hence " as " Strafford " and " Pickwick " 
do now ; whether the year has produced his- 
tories that will wear as well as Carlyle and 
Hallam have worn, or a biography that is worthy 
to be ranked with Lockhart's great achieve- 
ment. 

We have singled out for mention nine En- 
glish books of the year 1837. Let us make the 
number ten by adding, merely for its suggest- 
iveness, Harriet Martineau's " Society in Amer- 
ica." The condition of English literature on 
this side of the Atlantic may be outlined by 
saying that Irving had produced the greater 
part of his work, that rather more than half of 



Cooper's tales had been given to the world, 
that the poetical reputation of Bryant was well 
established, while the foundations were laid for 
the reputations of Whittier and Longfellow, 
and that the very year with which we are con- 
cerned was that in which Emerson's address on 
" The American Scholar " was heard and the 
"Twice-Told Tales" of Hawthorne collected 
for publication. While the showing for the 
year is not a remarkable one, even when we 
cast Prescott's " Ferdinand and Isabella " into 
the balance, it is evident that American litera- 
ture was fairly on its feet, and that its future 
was promising enough. 

It is a curious coincidence that both the 
foremost American writer and the foremost 
English writer now living should have been 
born in the same year, and that the year of the 
accession of the Queen. With all his critical 
vagaries and artistic inequalities, the position 
of Mr. Ho wells as our leading man of letters 
to-day may hardly be disputed, while the place 
of Mr. Swinburne, as not merely the greatest 
of living English poets, but as the greatest poet 
now living in the world, is beyond any possible 
question. It is difficult to think of either of 
these men as venerable, but sixty years goes 
far toward making up the normal tale of 
human life, and both novelist and poet must 
henceforth, for as long as they shall be spared 
us, take their places among the .elders of the 
literary hierarchy. 

Mr. H. D. Traill, in a recent summary of 
the English literature of the Victorian era, 
makes a rough division of the sixty years into 
three periods. The first score of years was a 
flowering time that brought into prominence 
the seven great names of Tennyson, Browning, 
Carlyle, Macaulay, Dickens, Thackeray, and 
Ruskin. During the second period the tide " of 
high literary achievement was pretty steadily 
receding," and " with the single, if the splendid, 
exception of Mr. Swinburne, the period not 
only produced no new poet of supreme genius, 
but brought forth none with any pretensions 
to a place in the first rank." When we think 
of Arnold, Morris, and Rossetti, it is impos- 
sible to accept so rash a dictum as the above, 
yet it is no doubt true that these names, to- 
gether with that of George Eliot, are not enough 
wholly to redeem the middle Victorian era from 
the charge of being essentially " the age of 
Trollope as a novelist and of Martin Tupper as 
a poet." As for the twenty years now ended, 
the principal things that Mr. Traill finds to say 
are that the art of the novelist has displayed 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



great vitality, and that if the new poets are but 
" minor," they are far better than the minor 
poets of earlier periods. 

An examination of cisatlantic English litera- 
ture during the past sixty years reveals the fact 
that Mr. Traill's three-fold division applies to 
our case also roughly, of course, because all 
such artificial divisions are rough but well 
enough to deserve employment. That is, our 
greater American writers accomplished the 
bulk of the best work during the first twenty- 
year period ; during the second period there was 
a distinct decline in productiveness, although a 
few brilliant names, as in England, redeem our 
literary annals from sterility ; and during the 
third period we find an expansion of the arts of 
fiction and poetry corresponding to what Mr. 
Traill finds in the literature of his own country. 
All of which facts go to show, what a good 
many people still need to be shown, that all the 
deeper forces operating in the development of 
our common literature operate upon both sides 
of the Atlantic, and that the " salt estranging 
sea " cannot bring about any real separation 
between the literatures of two nations having, 
up to comparatively recent times, a common 
history and a common intellectual and social 
tradition, while they still have, and always must 
retain, a common unifying speech. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

THE METRE OP "IN MEMORIAM." 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

Professor C. Alphonso Smith, in his interesting article 
on this subject in THE DIAL for June 16, says that he 
cannot believe Mr. Jennings is right in assuming that 
Tennyson " thought he had invented the metre." The 
Professor appears to be misled by the fact that Jennings 
makes this remark in commenting upon the publication 
of " In Memoriam " in 1850. At that time the poet 
doubtless was " too well versed in the lore of versifi- 
cation to consider himself the inventor of so simple 
a metrical combination"; but in 1833, when he first 
used the stanza in " You ask me why," etc., he may not 
have seen Herbert's volume, which (as I have said 
in my edition of " In Memoriam " ) is very rare and 
scarcely known even to critical students of early English 
poetry. 

It is more remarkable that Ilossetti should have sup- 
posed, in 1844, that he had rediscovered the metre. He 
had probably read Tennyson's early poems in this form, 
if not the examples of it in Herbert and Ben Jonson, 
but had forgotten that they were in the same metre. I 
have personally found that students and teachers who 
were well read in Tennyson had never noticed that these 
familiar early poems were in the metre of " In Memo- 
riam." I have known more than one college teacher 
who was so ignorant of the elements of versification 



that he could not read a line of Shakespeare correctly 
if it contained any peculiarity of accent or syllabication. 
The study of versification is generally neglected in the 
secondary schools, and too often in the colleges. 

Apropos of the verse of " In Memoriam," Mr. Joseph 
Jacobs, in his little book on the poem (London, 1892), 
dwells upon the " poverty and inaccuracy " of the 
rhymes. He gives in an appendix a list of the " false 
rhymes," which he makes out to be " no less than 168 
in 1448 couplets." The actual number is 48 or less, a 
few instances being open to question. Mr. Jacobs 
includes many " eye rhymes," like love, move, which all 
poets use freely; and rhymes of dissyllables with mono- 
syllables, like flower, hour, that are absolutely faultless, 
the dissyllable being treated as a monosyllable in rhythm 
as in rhyme by all our poets at will. Rhymes like ear, 
hear, the words differing only by the aspirate, are also 
reckoned by Mr. Jacobs, as by some authorities on verse, 
among his bad ones; but they are used by Milton (who 
has arms, harms, and high, I, if no others of the kind) 
and by many other poets. Tennyson, moreover, occa- 
sionally uses "identical rhymes," like here, hear, and 
ours, hours, which are allowed in Italian and certain 
other languages, and are admitted by sundry English 
poets familiar with Italian; as Milton (who has ruth, 
Ruth, etc.), and James Russell Lowell (holy, wholly, 
etc.). Besides here, ear (twice), we find in " In Me- 
moriam " art, heart (twice), hearth, earth, arm, harm, and 
here, hear, whirled, world, and moor, more. In the first 
edition there was another instance of this latter class of 
rhymes in cv., which read: 

" This holly by the cottage eave, 

To-night ungather'd shall it stand ; 

We live within the stranger's land, 
And strangely falls our Christmas eve." 
It now reads: 

" To-night ungather'd let us leave 

This laurel, let this holly stand ; " etc. 

The change was evidently made for other reasons than 
getting rid of the " identical rhyme." 

Rejecting all these rhymes regarded as faulty by 
Mr. Jacobs, we still have left some very bad ones: curse, 
horse; is, this; seas, peace; Lord, guard; sphere, there; 
I, enjoy; put, short, etc. One, on, occurs three times, to 
say nothing of gone, one, and one, alone, which, though 
" eye rhymes," are dubious examples of their class. 

Some familiar rhymes, as Mr. Jacobs notes, are often 
repeated: Jlower, hour, eight times; good, blood, seven 
times; while love is rhymed -with prove seven times, and 
with move or remove eight times. ,, T , ,,

Unfinished ? Nay; the Dawn is but a soul 
That hovers, doubtful, in this mortal air; 

'T is we who mould and shape the perfect whole, 
And weave each day her garments fine and fair. 

A face half seen, with wistful, kindling eyes, 
That woos and beckons but eludes us still; 

Out of the brooding, pulsing dusk she cries, 
" Lo, I am born! come clothe me as you will ! "

THE LATE MASTER OF BALLJOL,.* 

Benjamin Jowett has had many pupils who 
have never paced Oxford streets, nor dined at 
Balliol's table. They rejoice to have his biog- 
raphy in their hands to-day. It is well printed, 
well illustrated, well put together. Professor 
Campbell has narrated the early life, Dr. Abbott 
the years of the Mastership. They have left 
Jowett mainly to speak for himself, and he 
speaks significantly. 

No period of religious history is likely to be 
better known than that which begins with "The 
Aids to Reflection and Guesses at Truth " in 
1825, or with "The Christian Year" in 1827, 
and ends with the close of our century. The 
materials are even too copious. With the lives 
of Dr. Martineau and Archbishop Temple, 
when they shall be written, the collection for the 
future church historian to consider will be com- 
plete. The life of Jowett is the last important 
addition. Perhaps its authors might have a 
more sensitive eye for local color, or keener 
scent for an illustrative anecdote. In their 
scrupulous exclusion of the " mythology " which 
springs up in the footprints of any marked per- 
sonality, they have perhaps gone too far. But 
we are in no mood for fault-finding. There is 
enough to enjoy and to be thankful for ; too 
much easily to digest. 

It was at the beginning of the long peace 
that followed the battle of Waterloo, in the 
year of the death of Jane Austen and Madame 
de Stael, that, on April 15, 1817, Benjamin 
Jowett was born. Through two previous Ben- 
jamins, his father and grandfather, he traced 
his lineage to an austere patriarch, a convert of 
Whitefield, a London tradesman, of a plain 
yeoman stock, two of whose sons had been men 
of mark at Cambridge, as tutor at Magdalen, 
and Professor of Civil Law. Jowett's father 
was associated with Lord Shaftesbury in Fac- 
tory Eeform. He was a reserved, disinterested, 
lovable man, unsuccessful in business and in 
journalism, a devotee of music, a stout con- 
servative and orthodox churchman. It was in 
a sincerely religious household, of narrow means 
and modest station, bright with books and 
music and the air of liberal culture, that Jowett 
passed a delicate and precocious childhood. 

*THB LIFE AND LETTERS OF BENJAMIN JOWETT, M.A., 
Master of Balliol College, Oxford. By Evelyn Abbott, M.A 
and Lewis Campbell, M.A. In two volumes, with portrait 
and illustrations. New York : E. P. Button & Co 



When his companions were at play he would be 
stretched on the hearth-rug over Pope's Homer 
or Rollins's Ancient History. He knew his 
Cowper almost by heart, as he knew Virgil and 
Sophocles and Shakespeare afterwards. 

At St. Paul's school from the age of twelve, 
a round-faced, bright-eyed urchin, clad in " a 
perpetual sort of green sateen jacket," not at 
all a boy's boy, a serious student and voracious 
reader, Jowett held his own as the best Latinist 
of the school and as one who could speak out 
what he chose to say. It was a power that 
endured with him. 

The decisive incident of his career, " the 
happiest event of his life " as he called it, was 
winning a Balliol scholarship. Beginning at 
nineteen, " a puny chubby-faced lad," he went 
on in a natural scholastic evolution, from under- 
graduate to fellow, tutor, professor, master of 
his college, and vice-chancellor of the Univer- 
sity. Among his instructors were William 
George Ward and Archibald Tait, the future 
Archbishop. Stanley and Temple, John Cole- 
ridge and Stafford Northcote, Church, Froude, 
Brodie, and John Ruskin were among his con- 
temporaries. It was an exciting time and a 
stimulating group. Newman was still preach- 
ing at St. Mary's and Arnold still sending up 
earnest students from Rugby. Jowett was too 
busy and too poor to indulge himself much in 
society, nor was he swept away with the theo- 
logical whirlwinds about him. Already one of 
his distinctive gifts was visible. In whatever 
stress of conflict, he preserved " a characteristic 
calm, a passionless tenacity." Again, as among 
his schoolmates, he " held his own." 

Securing, while yet an undergraduate, a fel- 
lowship of his college in successful competition 
with maturer men, Jowett settled down to his 
university life. It was broken only by brief 
vacation journeys. Family cares pressed hard 
upon him, though he never married ; there was 
no money for extended travel until too late. 
Latinist as he was, he never saw Rome. Trans- 
lator of Plato and Aristotle and Thucydides 
as he was, he never saw Athens. Far and wide 
ihrough time and space ranged his discursive 
ntellect, but his outward frame kept close to 
Dxford lawns and cloisters. Early responsi- 
bility came to him. He was tutor at twenty- 
ive, with Arthur Clough and Matthew Arnold 
for pupils. The reputation of his college quickly 
rose. It came to be expected that his pupils 
should take First Classes. He was a teacher 
complete to the finger-tips, suggestive in all he 
';aught. He stimulated young minds, gave them

methods, not results, gave them a wholesome 
distrust of the words that override things, the 
terminology which so often obscures truth. He 
began at this time to shed some of his tradi- 
tional evangelicalism, while always clinging to 
its essential verities. For a time Newman 
attracted him. He was ready to think that if 
Newman and his friends could gain in charity 
toward those who differed from them, their 
work might be " almost one of unmixed good." 
It was a vast " if," quickly followed by an 
" alas " upon further acquaintance. Now and 
always Jowett hated religious agitation, while 
believing it sometimes a duty. He disliked 
religious discussion even with close friends. 
In later years he grew to set a higher value on 
outward expression, and was willing to risk cant 
rather than banish religion from familiar talk. 
He was anything but the satisfied rationalist, 
the jaunty liberal that Mallock caricatured in 
the " New Republic." In every letter you feel 
the presence of a profoundly earnest and bur- 
dened believer, whose heart repels the doubts 
that his reason has suggested. Yet for all his 
shrinking from doubt, he would not stifle 
inquiry. The vision of the naked truth might 
be ever so terrible, Jowett must look with open 
eyes. He must champion the truth and speak 
out plainly. But he will insist that even error 
shall have fair play. He will stand with Stanley 
for Ward in a moment of universal panic, until 
the tragedy dissolved in laughter at " Hilde- 
brand the Married Man." 

It was to that " Socrates-Silenus," as Jowett 
once nicknamed William George Ward, that 
Jowett owed his introduction to metaphysics. 
The new study for a while entranced him, but 
presently he weighed it and found it wanting. 
It lifted him out of the fogs of tradition into 
other vaporous regions of its own. Presently 
all clouds dispersed and he saw clearly. He 
come to look upon metaphysics as intellectual 
exercise rather than attainment, " a necessity 
rather than a great good. Its air is too rare- 
fied to breathe long." His study of Hegel left 
behind it a permanent deposit of the Hegelian 
attitude and method, and his comment on 
Hegelianism in the introduction to Plato's 
" Sophist " is lucid and sympathetic. Yet he 
was never Hegel's, nor was he any man's, dis- 
ciple. 

It was about 1847 that, with Stanley and 
Goldwin Smith and others, Jowett undertook 
the cause of University Reform. Always a 
radical, he was never a revolutionist. Because 
he went to the root of things he understood 



that time must be a factor in all healthy change 
and permanent progress. " Nothing I wish 
less than to see Oxford turned into a German 
or a London University." As he said earlier, 
" I wonder people do not feel the curse of hav- 
ing no old to entwine with the new." But he 
felt strongly that Oxford needed reform, and 
that only fit reform could forbid revolution. 
In comparison with foreign universities, Ox- 
ford still remained mediaeval. " We are so far 
below the level of the German ocean that I fear 
we shall one day be utterly deluged." So 
Jowett did his part to bring his university 
nearer to his age. 

He was the natural successor to the Master- 
ship, when, in 1854, Dr. Jenkins died. Theo- 
logical prejudice prevailed and a " safer " and 
more learned, but less able, man was elected. 
It was not what Jowett had yet done which 
turned the scales, but what he was felt to be 
capable of doing. As always, he would speak 
out. He justified the anxieties of his opponents 
by publishing his volumes on certain of St. 
Paul's Epistles. The work was most original 
and bold. Before it was quite understood how 
bold, the Greek professorship fell vacant. 
Jowett's fitness for it was beyond question, and 
he was elected at the paltry stipend of forty 
pounds a year. Friends came forward with a 
gift to make up the deficiency. But Jowett re- 
fused it and waited ten years for the authori- 
ties to do what they should, and raise the sal- 
ary to the fit sum of five hundred pounds. 
Meantime he did not magnify his grievance, 
nor waste strength in bewailing it. With or 
without due compensation, he would work as if 
he perceived no connection between work and 
wages. To work was his business, to see that 
he was paid was Dr. Pusey's or any other Doc- 
tor's responsibility. It was " heroic industry " 
with him at all times. As formerly in his 
tutorship, so now in his professorship, he spent 
himself for his pupils. He treated his relation 
to them as a pastoral charge, his department 
of Christian ministry. At all hours his door 
stood open. He was at the beck and call of 
anyone who needed him. It is hard to see how 
he got through his own work, thus busy with 
every man's. He demanded from his stu- 
dents their best, implied a belief in their unde- 
veloped possibilities, " and the belief seemed to 
create the thing believed in." Nor did his in- 
terest end with the days of their pupilage. 
Letter upon letter shows how faithfully and 
lovingly he followed them, with what tact and 
wisdom he counselled or chid them. He would 



10

[July 1, 



not cramp or enslave them. He would not 
rivet their growing minds upon a mould of his. 
He would only help them to be most and best 
themselves. He had doubtless his disappoint- 
ments, but he had also his rich rewards in a 
devotion, an affection, as he said with tears, 
" far beyond his deserts." They judged best 
of that. 

The two stout octavos on the Epistles to the 
Thessalonians, Romans, and Galatians were a 
contribution to a Commentary on the whole 
New Testament projected by Dr. Arnold, which 
Stanley and Jowett long hoped to complete. 
If the first sample of Jowett's method had met 
with greater favor, perhaps the purpose had 
been more fully accomplished and the Church 
yet more his debtor. The time was not ripe. 
" I thought I had so expressed myself that re- 
ligious minds could not be wounded," Jowett 
wrote. He did not find it so. He had not only 
laid aside accepted terminology, but he had 
touched to the quick cherished preconceptions, 
entangled as they were with deep religious feel- 
ing. He had assumed that all men loved the 
truth as purely as he and were as ready to wel- 
come any frank presentation of it. He had 
studied St. Paul in his own light, and refused 
to subject him to controversial fires. To Jowett 
the epistles appeared to be, not dogmatic trea- 
tises, but occasional letters preserved where 
others had been lost, revealing the mind and 
character of their author, and disclosing the 
period of his labors, as well as inspired with a 
precious message. Only by implication could 
the work be held controversial. It argued with 
nobody, refuted nobody. It asserted principles, 
suggested parallels, appealed to reason and con- 
science, and left the result to the judgment of 
open-minded readers. It was not that Jowett 
rejected, but that he ignored as irrelevant, the 
authority of Greek or Latin fathers and Angli- 
can divines. What said St. Paul's Greek in 
a dialect which was Hebraic and not classical ? 
What did such words from such a man at such 
a time really signify ? What was their force, 
broadly interpreted in the spirit rather than 
the letter, not as a legal document or theolog- 
ical dogma, but as impassioned and practical 
discourse? What lessons of immediate duty 
had they for men to-day ? These were the ques- 
tions Jowett sought to ask and answer, in sim- 
ple notes that did not evade difficulties and 
luminous disquisitions which marked an epoch 
in English theology. Since the days of the 
Cambridge Platonists, if we except Coleridge 
and Arnold, no such voice had been heard as 



this. " There was no mistaking what this man 
meant." There is much of such frank discus- 
sion now ; then there was little. Divines were 
enlisted in party camps and rarely ventured 
beyond them. This man walked in the open. 
His neighbors first stared, then grew pale, then 
reddened with rage. He held that when men 
were inspired they still remained human. It 
was a dangerous proposition ; it was no better 
than Milman's calling Abraham an Arab sheik. 
It meant mischief, nobody knew exactly what 
or how, but it must be put down before it 
should go farther. Yet this was not the worst. 
Jowett had ventured upon a thorough treat- 
ment of the great theme of the Atonement. The 
subject was in the air. Independently, at the 
same period, McLeod Campbell was handling 
it in Scotland and Horace Bushnell in Con- 
necticut. It was a theme so interwoven with 
the most sacred memories and experiences that 
it could not be touched without jarring upon 
many of the simple and devout, as well as upon 
all the bigoted and dogmatic, spirits of the time. 
To use Stuart Mill's luminous distinction, it 
was not what it denoted but what it connoted 
that gave occasion for alarm. Jowett, who always 
dealt with truth as in a vacuum, forgot that 
others saw her veiled in a cloud and could not 
distinguish a dispersion of the vapor from an 
outrage upon the form. He spoke out plainly 
and gave more offence than there was need to 
give. To remove such obstructions the essay 
was rewritten for the edition of 1859. Another 
essay was not ready for either the first or the 
second edition. In the third edition of 1894 
it has found its place. It was upon the inter- 
pretation of Scripture, and formed part of the 
volume called " Essays and Reviews." 

That very unequal volume by several hands 
roused a violent commotion. The orthodoxy 
of the church was morbidly irritable. Convo- 
cation lost its head. Clamor and panic ruled 
the hour. Scholars like Thirlwall, recent her- 
esiarchs like Hampden, even liberals like Mau- 
rice, joined the cry. The heresy-hunt began. 
Jowett had spoken out, and now quietly held 
his own. Pained by the obloquy, he made 
no complaint, offered no apology. Phillips 
Brooks in like case was grandly silent. It 
was a wise attitude at a season when men 
thought " that no enlightened person should be- 
come a clergyman, and that the clergyman who 
became enlightened should be unfrocked." 
American opinion reflected English. When 
our one Broad Church bishop of that period 
denied that each particle of the buried body 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



11 



would be re-united with its fellows in the final 
resurrection, an able layman remarked that the 
denial was just, but dreadful from the lips of 
a bishop. Jowett said that if it rained mitres 
no one of them could possibly fit him. Cer- 
tainly no mitre could have muzzled him and no 
storm beating upon his mitred or unmitred head 
could have dismayed him. In a letter to Ten- 
nyson's children he gave them in capitals two 
golden counsels, Never Fear and Never Cry. 
He had tried them both before giving them. 
He stood his ground and scorned to whimper. 
He liked success, owned to a prejudice against 
those who fail, but for his own part his only 
recognition of failure was as a spur to effort. 
It did not embitter him, if it left him sore. 
He would patiently tolerate even the intoler- 
ant. But he would "wait for another world 
before joining in any closer union with them." 
It is the very instinct of self-preservation, akin 
to his who said of certain troubling spirits : 
" They are good people. We shall meet them 
in heaven, and that is soon enough." 

Jowett was seventy years old when a serious 
illness left him a chronic invalid, compelled to 
measure his tasks and reduce his hours of 
working. Still he made great plans and would 
toil to the last. " What a fate," he said, " for 
a man to retire for contemplation, and then to 
find he had nothing to think about. But per- 
haps he would never find out ! " was his play- 
ful comment. Such hapless lot could not be 
Jowett's. If he had nothing else to think of 
there were always the affairs of his friends to 
interest him. He had a marvellous genius for 
friendship and could love a score as few men 
can love anyone. The close of his life was 
shadowed by their departure. Stanley, Lord 
Iddesleigh, Matthew Arnold, Robert Brown- 
ing, Lord Sherbrooke, Alfred Tennyson, were 
gone, and it was time for an old man to 

41 Wrap the drapery of his couch 
About him and lie down to pleasant dreams." 

At Hedly Park, on a visit to dear friends, the 
not unwelcome summons came. It was a Sun- 
day afternoon, the first day of October in the 
year 1893. As he lay in his last sleep " the 
moon shone in and lit up his beautiful marble 
face and the shining white hair. There seemed 
a blending of the dignity of age and the sim- 
plicity and radiant freshness of youth." Among 
his last words were : " Mine has been a happy 
life. I bless God for my happy life." 

It had been a rarely wise and useful and dis- 
tinguished life. It had spared no labor to at- 
tain excellence, it had spent itself on others, it 



had kept ever before it noble aims. Jowett 
had early discerned the preciousness and ma- 
jesty of truth, and had followed where truth 
led him through all mazes of opinion. If he 
threw down idols it was not from love of de- 
struction, but to make room for the living 
spirit whose place they had usurped. Nothing 
can be less just than to regard Jowett as one 
who sought revolution or fostered unbelief. He 
encountered and brushed aside doubts on his 
way to positive convictions. " Doubt," he said 
in one of those earnest sermons which he 
preached to the young men with whom his 
days were spent, " is not some great exertion 
of the mind, but mere weakness. . . . We may 
hope to live through it like other disorders." 
He declared indulgence in doubt " the spirit 
most alien to that of inquiry. It might be called 
the ghost of inquiry." He bewailed the scep- 
tic mood which an age of science, not yet con- 
scious of its own limitations, had bred among 
the young. He felt that it was a mood not to 
be argued down but to be lived down. " Our 
reason is in great measure dependent upon our 
will." " Belief must radiate from life. What 
we are in a certain sense we shall believe." In 
his sermons and in his letters you feel that this 
great teacher is not primarily concerned with 
thought but with conduct and character, that 
he is moralist and pastor of souls even more 
than theologian or philosopher. You feel that 
to him simple goodness is the soul's chief good. 
" Let us know no other watchwords but the 
life of Christ, the mind of Christ, the cross of 
Christ," he said. 

The accusers of Ian Maclaren and Bishop 
Sessums might perhaps detect flaws in Jowett's 
theology. His working creed was more brief 
than the Athanasian symbol. It did not define 
miracles or state the precise limits of nature 
and the supernatural. It did not sharply dis- 
sever the inspiration of the Psalmists and St. 
Paul from that of Plato and Tennyson. It laid 
more stress on holiness than upon sin, upon 
love and pity than upon wrath and judgment. 
It emphasized the ethical elements of religion 
and found in conduct the safest criterion of 
character, and in character the surest evidence 
of life. Jowett was a man of faith, though he 
sometimes saw dimly, of hope and love always. 
He was of the pure in heart, who may be blind 
to many things, but still see God. However 
he erred in opinion, he ever sought and served 
the truth. That is the orthodoxy that will be 
worth most to us when all accounts are reck- 
oned up. Meanwhile, these are safe watch-

words : " the life of Christ, the mind of Christ, 
the cross of Christ." 

A former President of Yale, Dr. Woolsey, 
in a sonnet of great beauty, tells us how St. 
John found 

" The blindfold Plato trembling at the door " 

of Heaven, and that he 

" led the mild enthusiast on 

Towards the Eternal Word, Heaven's source of Day. 
Then loosed the bandage and the sage, no more 
A sage but saint, beheld and knelt to adore." 

If we can imagine the Master of Balliol look- 
ing on at that august presentation, we may see 
his face smiling, yet grave with a dreamy per- 
plexity, and hear from him in that " cherubic 
chirp " which his friends delight to remember, 
"I thought you had known one another all 
along." Where wisdom and goodness were, 
Jowett believed Christ must ever be.

significance in the life which animates and beau- 
tifies our earth which it is worth our while to 
consider, not only for the widening of our intel- 
lectual horizon, but for the continual joy it may 
infuse into our daily experience. There are 
evidences of this late awakening in various pop- 
ular movements toward nature-study and in a 
rapidly increasing literature aiming to promote 
the same useful purpose. The array of books 
herewith presented testifies to the growing 
interest in the pages of Nature. 

Few volumes are more entertaining than that 
in which Mr. Skinner tells of the health and 
happiness to be found in cultivating " Nature 
in a City Yard." The portion of the earth's do- 
main lying in the rear of the author's Brooklyn 
residence is only eighteen feet by fifty, yet from 
this restricted area he contrives to extract mar- 
vels of enjoyment. In the height of the flower- 
ing season he feasts his eyes upon nearly sixty 
varieties of plants in bloom at the same time. All 
the pleasures of a successful gardener are his ; 
but to these he adds the refinements of the man 
of culture, the humorist, and the philosopher. 
As he digs and plants and waters and prunes 
in his tiny, thrifty precinct, his thoughts are 
as busy as his hands, and every circumstance 
connected with his work suggests some sage, 
shrewd, genial, or merry idea. His writing 
proclaims him a man of versatility, a scholar, 
a wag, with keen insight, a light heart, and a 
passionate leaning toward nature. " Pessimism 
is worse than tragedy," he avers ; " it is a 
tragedy of the soul ; the attitude of a tired-out 
race. When we keep in touch with Nature we 
share her splendid life. For Nature, even a 
yardf ul of it, makes health in her communicant. 
Get away from self-consciousness. Think not 
of your mind nor of your fate. Why be always 
thinking on your end ? as graveyard literature 
hath it. We are here to live ; not to die." He 
is content with his lot ; and, reflecting on the 
cares and miseries of the rich, cheerily observes 
that " The chief blessing of poverty is that 
other folks do n't ask you to help them to live." 
His pages are sown with wise and witty sayings, 
and provoke many a welcome laugh as well as 
serious moment of meditation. 

We have but to announce a new volume 
by Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller to assure the 
nature-lover of a literary treat. Mrs. Miller's 
writings are invariably crisp and spicy, and are 
composed of substantial as well as appetizing 
substance. "Upon the Tree - Tops " brings 
within a single pair of book -lids thirteen 
sketches of bird-life which, with one or two ex- 



1897.]

ceptions, have previously attracted attention in 
the pages of " The Atlantic Monthly " and sim- 
ilar periodicals. They will bear a second pe- 
rusal, and in their present pretty setting are 
even more engaging than in their original form. 
They are accompanied by ten full-page engrav- 
ings by Mr. F. Carter Beard, which are unus- 
ually interesting in design and are exquisitely 
reproduced. The opening sketch, describing 
" Tramps with an Enthusiast," is perhaps the 
most entertaining of the entire number, from 
its abundant humor and lively incident. If 
there be a specially blissful experience in this 
mortal life, it is that which comes to a pair 
of enthusiastic ornithologists out in the field 
pursuing the objects of their affection under 
favorable conditions. Such were the circum- 
stances depicted in this opening chapter. Suc- 
ceeding portions of the volume relate with 
piquant grace Mrs. Miller's observations of the 
humming-bird in nesting-time, the winter wren 
in its Northern home, the chat, the shrike, and 
other fascinating members of the feathered race 
in the happy relations of family life. The au- 
thor is one who looks upon nature with a keen 
and attentive eye, and tells us little that she 
has not seen and studied for herself. Her con- 
tributions to bird - literature are therefore as 
trustworthy in substance as they are agreeable 
in form. 

It is two years since Mr. Frank M. Chapman 
published his valuable handbook on the " Birds 
of Eastern North America," and now he has 
followed it with a smaller supplementary work 
in which his masterly attainments in the science 
of ornithology are equally well shown. This 
second volume does not aim to give as compre- 
hensive a view of " Bird Life " in the United 
States as did the first, but it contains as much 
of the choicest information regarding a hundred 
or more of our familiar species as could be 
compressed within its limits. The opening chap- 
ters present a clear, concise summary of the 
evolution of the chief features of the bird, of 
its colors, of the curious phenomena connected 
with its migration, of its song and its domestic 
habits, together with directions for identifying 
and classifying it. The concluding portion is 
filled with attractive descriptions of the species 
we are most likely to meet in the woods and 
fields and by the wayside. The illustrations 
with which the book is generously provided are 
true to the life in form and attitude, and higher 
praise cannot be given. The student who selects 
this work as a guide to his observations of bird- 
life will not go amiss. 



A half-dozen pleasant Summer sketches by 
Mr. T. W. Higginson are included in the vol- 
ume entitled " The Procession of the Flowers." 
The papers do not now appear in print for the 
first time. Some of them bear a date several 
years back ; but they well preserve their early 
freshness and charm. Their author has truly 
said : " No person can portray nature from any 
slight or transient acquaintance." Mr. Hig- 
ginson has loved and studied the phases of the 
out-door world throughout a long life-time. He 
knows the flowers, the insects, the birds, and 
seldom errs in writing of them. Not only their 
names but their individual traits, their distinc- 
tive peculiarities, are familiar to him ; and he 
characterizes each with the right word or the 
felicitous phrase. Of the humming-bird, " the 
smallest of feathery things, and the loveliest," 
he asks : " Did gems turn to flowers, flowers 
to feathers, in that long-past dynasty of the 
Humming- Birds ? " And, lost in surprise over 
the miracle of a bird's egg, he observes won- 
deringly : " That one may bear home between 
his fingers all that winged splendor, all that 
celestial melody, coiled in mystery within these 
tiny walls ! it is as if a pearl opened and an 
angel sang." 

Such books as " Memories of the Months," 
by Sir Herbert Maxwell, exemplify the full 
value of the powers of observation and appre- 
ciation. Nothing worthy of note escapes the 
author's view or fails to yield a due degree of 
satisfaction. The precious habit of looking at 
things attentively and of transcribing at the 
instant the points exciting interest has put him 
in possession of a mass of valuable observations 
from which his present volume is drawn. They 
relate chiefly to objects in nature, and yet in 
part refer to the works of man, for the author 
is an earnest antiquarian as well as field natur- 
alist. Wide culture and a genial frame of 
mind are reflected in his literary style, which 
is unpretending and elegant. The " Memories," 
having an intimate connection with the varying 
seasons, are ranged in sections under the suc- 
cessive months of the year, and thus form a 
coherent whole. With the embellishment of 
pictures, the fine letter-press, and the dainty 
binding, the book is a most attractive one 
throughout. 

The volume entitled " Round the Year," by 
Professor L. C. Miall, contains a series of 
natural-history sketches suggested by incidents 
which took place under the author's observa- 
tion at different seasons and places in the year 
1895. He is a man of science and a trained 



14

observer. No event in nature escapes his notice, 
and each is searched with a careful eye, that its 
origin and destiny may if possible be discovered. 
His sketches cover a multitude of subjects in 
astronomy, botany, meteorology, ornithology, 
entomology, and various other ologies. He 
leads the reader into studies that are profound 
although not prolonged, revealing, as he goes 
along, a mass of curious and engaging facts, 
such as lie in every object of the outer world, 
ready to disclose themselves to the inquiring 
mind. Some of his most interesting investiga- 
tions are connected with such subjects as 
" Snowflakes," "Catkins," "The Cuckoo," 
" Gossamer," " The Structure of a Feather," 
and " Tennyson as a Naturalist." But his 
work is of an earnest and even quality through- 
out, blending instruction with entertainment 
in the manner of an adroit expounder. The 
book is very handsomely produced, the illustra- 
tions being especially minute in line and clear 
in cut. 

" In the Garden of Peace " is a winning title, 
and its effect is fully sustained by the chapters 
it binds together in a unified construction. The 
" Garden " was a " Paradise of Birds," as its 
owner, " Helen Milman," asserts on the title- 
page and clearly establishes in the progress of 
her volume. It belonged to a secluded estate, 
remote from the village, almost hidden, indeed, 
by surrounding woods ; and it possessed ideal 
charms for the lover of Nature in her more quiet 
forms. " It was aglow with the colors of a thou- 
sand flowers throughout the seasons of budding 
and blooming, gay with the butterflies sipping 
their sweets, and joyous all the year round with 
the life and the song of the birds which made 
their homes in every tree and bush, secure of 
the loved protection of the Adam and Eve who 
dwelt in unalloyed happiness in the midst of 
this earthly paradise." The chapters severally 
depicting the flowers and the birds glorifying 
the " Garden of Peace " are in such harmony 
with their spirit that one is soothed and de- 
lighted as with an actual^ visit to the lovely 
scene. They impart a fresh sense of the pos- 
sibilities for the culture of our better selves, 
which the beautiful objects of nature always 
possess. 

Mr. Robert J. Morris displays a decided lit- 
erary gift, as well as a keen love of sport, in 
the collection of sketches which bear the name 
of the first one in the series, " Hopkins's Pond." 
They have been written without effort and with- 
out restraint, a fine instinct permitting the au- 
thor to yield himself with entire abandon to the 



mood for description or reminiscence. He is an 
animated and engaging narrator, and has a gen- 
uine appreciation of nature, gaining our hearty 
good-will through these faculties, despite the 
lamentable fact that he rejoices in beguiling 
the duck to his death by means of a base decoy, 
and delights in torturing the captive trout until 
its last breath is expired. 

Messrs. Appleton & Co.'s promising series 
of " Home Reading Books," edited by Dr. 
William T. Harris, gives the first place in its 
Natural History division to a valuable little 
work, by Mr. James Newton Baskett, relating 
" The Story of the Birds." The title is in a 
slight degree misleading, as the book is prac- 
tically a history of the evolution of the birds 
of their structure, pedigrees, costumes, and 
customs as far as this can at present be un- 
folded. In every respect it deserves commenda- 
tion, its author exhibiting a good command of 
his subject and a persuasive way of presenting 
it. His readers are expected to be largely of 
the juvenile class ; yet the older students of 
bird-lore will take pleasure in the volume, and 
profit also, so skilfully are its contents ordered, 
so clearly and with so much charm of manner 
are they set forth. There was room in the 
naturalist's library for just such a treatise, and 
Mr. Baskett has spared no pains to fit his 
treatise for useful service. The book is very 
neatly printed and excellently illustrated, and 
to aid the reader in easy reference to its myriad 
topics a compact analysis of the chapters is fur- 
nished at the beginning with an ample index at 
the close. To crown the merits of the volume, 
it is offered at a price so low that the humblest 
home may lay it among the treasures of its 
reading-table. 

The second number of Appletons' series of 
" Home Reading Books " is less satisfactory 
than the first. It is a compilation of passages 
from various authors, relating to strange and 
striking members of " The Plant World." In 
too many cases the extracts are not as simple 
and engaging in style as they should be. They 
lack life, and give one the feeling that they are 
done at second-hand, rather than from personal 
knowledge of the objects described. A few 
evince the enthusiasm of the botanist who 
speaks from actual experience. Surely the 
editor could have found abundant material for 
his purpose in the works of recent writers who 
depict Nature in all her forms with an intelli- 
gence and eloquence which capture the heart of 
every reader.

TRAVELS FAR AND VARIOUS.* 

The wheelman contributes a new element of 
interest to books of travel. The story of adventures 
of the steel steed, on various roads and in peculiar 
situations, takes the place of remarks, critical and 
otherwise, on horses and conveyances, or on steam- 
ers and railways, to which we have become accus- 
tomed in the older literature of travel. One of the 
latest contributions to the fast increasing books of 
bicycle travel is " Sketches Awheel in Modern 
Iberia," by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Workman. The 
tale of their trip will hardly encourage imitators, 
for our authors suffered much from heat and from 
the villainous roads, were attacked by irate mule- 
drivers, and were stoned by malicious children. 
However, they sometimes had their reward, as in 
the forty-mile ride from Elche to Murcia, of which 
they say : 

" We have taken grand rides, desolate rides, and 
lovely rides, but never one so intoxicatingly beautiful as 
this through African Spain. And in praising we echo 
the words of a German, one of the few writers on Spain 
who appear to have visited this region, Why is this 
lovely corner of the world so little known ? ' " 

They made the tour of the principal cities of Spain, 
and varied their travels by a mule-back ride from 
Tangier to Tetuan, Morocco. The writers have 
little that is new or notable to tell, and the style is 
for the most part rather commonplace, though an 
occasional sketch, as that of their stay at the inn of 
Tarancon, shows considerable descriptive power. 
Foreign words are too much in evidence : in the 
space of three sentences we notice Spanish, German, 
and French. The book contains a fair map, and 
the photographic illustrations are clear. 

In "Naples in the Nineties," Mr. E. Neville- 
Rolfe, English Consul for South Italy, gives in 
attractive style some instructive chapters on the 
Naples of yesterday and to-day, on the survivals of 
ancient paganism and mediaeval witchcraft, on ex- 
cursions to the buried cities of Campania, to a 
garden-farm, and to various places of interest near 
Naples and its famous bay, and closing with an

eighteenth-century diary of an Italian tour. The 
book seems primarily designed for the tourist ; and 
while of especial value to him, it will yet be of ser- 
vice to any reader who wishes to understand the 
Italy of to-day. Naples of late years has felt the 
progressive spirit which has been permeating all 
Italy. Streets have been widened, slums removed, 
sewers constructed, new industries started, and 
the play of the Nativity suppressed. Says our 
author : 

" The time is coming when a Neapolitan will answer 
a letter, keep an appointment, have some little regard 
for truth and some small respect for the feelings of his 
neighbors. The cabman will some day drive with whips 
which do not rend the air with their terrible cracking; 
they will learn kindness to animals, and the use of soap 
and water; insect life will be kept at bay, and the city 
will fall to the dead level of Paris, Berlin, or any other 
civilized town." 

Yet we are glad to believe him when he elsewhere 
says that " Naples has a quaintness and charm of 
her own, which municipalities cannot destroy, and 
civilization cannot altogether wreck." The author 
has long been resident in Italy, and, writing from 
full knowledge, has given us an excellent handbook 
to Naples and to Campania in general. 

Captain S. L. Hinde tells us, in " The Fall of the 
Congo Arabs," a simple but graphic story of the 
conquest and expulsion of the Arab traders from 
Nyangwe and Kasongo by the Belgians of the Congo 
Free State. This struggle the author regards as " a 
turning-point in African history," in that it crushed 
out an incipient Mohammedan Empire of slave 
raiders in the Congo Basin. Besides this first-hand 
account of a notable conflict between European and 
Arab, we find in this book many entertaining and 
instructive remarks on the country and its inhabit- 
ants. For instance, the author's descriptions of the 
African road, of the " water people," and of the 
pigmies, are distinctly interesting. On cannibals 
and their practices he gives the fullest information 
we have come across. He learned that 
" The prisoner or slave who was to form the piece de 
resistance had always his arms and legs broken three 
days beforehand, and was then placed in a stream, or 
pool of water, chin-deep, with his head tied to a stick to 
prevent his committing suicide, or perhaps falling asleep 
and thus getting drowned. On the third day he was taken 
out and killed, the meat then being very tender." 

Again, he says that 

" When the chief of the town who is of course an 
absolute monarch decides that a man must die, he 
hands him over to the people. He is immediately torn 
to pieces, and disappears as quickly as a hare is broken 
up by a pack of hounds. Every man lays hold of him 
at once with one hand, and with the other whips off the 
piece with his knife; no one stops to kill him first, for 
he would by doing so lose his piece." 

During the two years' war with Arabs, cannibalism 
was rife after battles and the storming of towns ; 
the " human wolves disposed of all the dead, leaving 
nothing even for the jackals." Finally, as a picture

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



of African savagery, we cannot refrain from quoting 
Captain Hinde's description of N' Gandu. 

" The village, containing from ten to fifteen thousand 
inhabitants, was oval in form, and strongly fortified by 
a double ditch and loopholed earthwork, the whole 
being surrounded by a palisade. The top of every tree 
in this palisade was crowned with a human skull. Six 
gateways defended the village; and, after passing 
through each gate, it was necessary to traverse a tunnel, 
some thirty yards long, made out of piles of large tim- 
ber, and loopholed throughout its whole length. On the 
top of this tunnel was a guardhouse, the floor of which 
was honeycombed into holes, through which the guard 
above could spear an unsuspecting passenger on the 
road below. The approach to each of these six gates 
was ornamented by a pavement of human skulls, the 
bregma being the only part that showed above ground. 
This pavement was of snowy whiteness, and polished to 
the smoothness of ivory by the daily passage of hundreds 
of naked feet. I counted more than two thousand skulls 
in the pavement of one of the gates alone." 

We cordially commend this volume as a fresh, enter- 
taining, and valuable account of a very dark spot in 
" darkest Africa." The book contains in its final 
chapters a description of an exploring trip up the 
Lualaba River and into the Lukuga River, when the 
author was forced to turn back by serious illness. 
An elaborate map of a part of the Congo Basin adds 
to the value of the work. 

As a mighty hunter and fisher, Mr. Abel Chap- 
man has ranged Western Europe from South Spain 
to Spitzbergen, and has written several accounts of 
his experiences, the present volume, "Wild Nor- 
way," being the fourth and last of the series. Mr. 
Chapman is of the best type of English big-game 
hunter. He is no butcher, but takes an intelligent 
interest in wild animals, and is a close student and 
fervent admirer of all wild life. He is a seeker of 
trophies, and obtains splendid specimens of reindeer 
and elk heads ; but he also has an interest in smaller 
animals, as witness this account of the lemming: 

" If his powers were proportioned to his pluck, the 
lemming would make things lively for the hunter. Had 
the bear, the lynx, or the mighty elk but a thousandth 
part of the lemming's aggressive ferocity, the relative 
position of hunter and hunted would be reversed, and 
an expedition to the f jeld would require an advance 
guard of cavalry and a support of Maxim guns. The 
lemming attacks with reckless fury the harmless passer- 
by. One small creature (smaller than a rat) will assail, 
without second thought, a couple of human beings 
weighing a hundred and fifty pounds apiece; it will 
spring at one's knees, biting and barking, and in pur- 
blind fury fall back all-ends-up to earth, only to renew 
the attack again and again. To-day, while one lemming 
was flying at me, another from a small stream joined in 
the demonstration, presently swimming across to get to 
close quarters." 

The author's observations on birds will have some 
value for the ornithologist. His remarks on the 
Norwegian peasantry, on the Lapp, and on Nor- 
wegian scenery, are frequently of interest. The 
opening of the Northern summer is thus mentioned : 
" Leaf bursts forth on tree and shrub while one 



watches it ; on all sides is heard the cracking of the 
buds of birch and plane-trees, the unfolding of 
fern-fronds is well-nigh visible." The greatest de- 
fects of this book are its fragmentary character, 
and also that lack of sentiment and imagination 
which is a trait of most English travellers. The 
illustrations, which are drawn from life, are ex- 
tremely clear, accurate, and interesting. 

Professor E. A. Freeman's " Sketches of Travel 
in Normandy and Maine," as reprinted from the 
"Saturday Review" and the "Guardian," may be 
considered as an appendix to his " Sketches of 
French Travel," and as a series of notes illustrative 
of " The Norman Conquest." Their interest is not 
so much in their accounts of travels as in their anti- 
quarian description and discussion ; and hence they 
will hardly appeal to the general reader. But the 
connoisseur of mediaeval history and architecture 
will find these brief papers very suggestive and in- 
structive, being saturated with lore, and always 
competent, accurate, and incisive. The book con- 
tains much information, not easily found elsewhere, 
concerning out-of-the way historic places in north- 
western France. In this work, as in all his works, 
Mr. Freeman brusquely speaks his mind on all 
occasions. For instance, his remarks on " the brutal 
work " of architectural restorations is full of sav- 
age denunciations. Mr. Freeman's drawings of 
ancient buildings will appeal more to the architect 
than the artist. The volume contains an index, but 
has no map. 

Quite in contrast to " In Tolstoi Land," lately 
noticed in THE DIAL, which depicted Russia fam- 
ishing, we now have a book giving a picture of 
Russia feasting. " In Joyful Russia," by Mr. John 
A. Logan, Jr., is a rather highly-colored narrative 
of the recent coronation proceedings, and a very 
eulogistic account of the Imperial family. The 
author also gives some interesting notes on Russian 
baths, restaurants, houses, horses, etc. As a sample 
of his descriptions, we quote his account of the 
netting of the famous fish, the sterlet, in Moscow 
restaurants. 

" The perfection of the sterlet is so dependent upon 
its size and freshness that in many of the crack res- 
taurants of Moscow, and of a few other cities that are 
near enough to the Volga, a great marble basin forms 
the centre of the dining-room. This basin is three- 
quarters filled with limpid water water in which great 
aquatic plants dwell plants between whose splendid 
leaves magnificent sterlet dart, lifting now and again 
their shapely heads to catch the spray falling from the 
fountain, that, with a slim, straight, and then gracefully- 
falling shaft of water, punctuates the small pool's 
centre. The Russian gourmet who is old enough, and 
the Russian gourmet who is young enough, to take a 
keen satisfaction in the display of his gastronomical 
judgment and exquisite taste goes to the marble brink 
of this artificial lake and nets his own sterlet. The 
waiter hands him a net, fanciful of handle and silken 
of web. He grasps it, looks critical, then wise, and 
thrusts it into the pool. If he is lucky he brings up a 
fish. If not, he tries again. When, sooner or later, he

captures his prey, with a gesture of triumph he hands 
his net to the attendant and hies to his potage. Almost 
before his soup is removed, the sterlet is brought to him, 
dressed in any way he has ordered, and cooked to per- 
fection. I noticed that most of the travellers dining 
at the Moscow restaurants liked to net their own ster- 
let. I did it once. But it was stupid sport, and after 
that I always left the selection of my fish to the waiter, 
who understood what I did not which were the choice 
specimens." 

As a narrative of a few weeks' trip through Rus- 
sia, by a young, lively, impressionable, enthusiastic 
American, who was most magnificently treated by 
Russian officialdom, this book is very pleasant and 
readable ; but it cannot well be taken as a serious, 
impartial, and thorough account of the Russia of 
to-day, although the author expresses very strongly 
his decided optimistic opinions on Russian society 
and government. The style sometimes over-does 
itself in point of vividness, and the way in which the 
author frequently alludes to his mother can hardly 
be called in good taste. The photographic illustra- 
tions are in the main fresh and interesting, and the 
colored pictures are fairly successful. 

The Armenian massacre has been somewhat dis- 
placed in popular interest by the Turko-Greek war, 
yet the volume of "Letters from Armenia," by 
Professor J. Rendel Harris and Mrs. Harris, will be 
found of considerable interest by many. Mr. and 
Mrs. Harris went to Armenia in 1896, as dispensers 
of an English relief fund, and these letters to friends 
in England relate some of their experiences. They 
fully corroborate other accounts of the Turkish and 
Kurdish atrocities in Ourfa, Harpoot, Eghin, and 
other towns ; they show the apostolic unction and 
fervent piety of their Quaker authors, and make 
plain how in Asia Minor to-day, as of old, " the 
blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." 
The writers have the highest praise for the Ameri- 
can missionaries. As information, the letters are 
only very brief and sketchy. As to style, they have 
little literary quality, being mostly familiar and 
commonplace in tone, and sometimes careless, as 
" nice talks," '< met us to tea," etc. Professor Harris, 
who is best known as a specialist on ancient Chris- 
tian manuscripts, made some rather ineffective 
search for treasures in this line. The book contains 
a route map, and some photographic illustrations. 

It is pleasant to turn from the sufferings of 
Armenia, and view the prosperity of a country 
lately Turkish, but now under Austrian rule. That 
country is Bosnia, described by Mr. H. C. Thomson 
in his book entitled " The Outgoing Turk." Twenty 
years ago Bosnia was, like Armenia to-day, a land 
of extortion, robbery, and massacre; but now, thanks 
to the enlightened administration of Austria, she 
can be depicted as a land of peace and prosperity. 
Our author visited not only the main cities, but also 
the remoter districts, and gives a careful and trust- 
worthy account of the social and industrial status of 
the inhabitants, throwing much light on the former 
Mohammedan government. The main cause of the 



Turkish misrule everywhere is, as he points out, the 
autocratic power of the Sultan, by which favorites 
are appointed to govern provinces, and a thorough- 
going spoils system is established. A subsidiary 
cause is the fact that the methods of modern com- 
mercial success are debarred the true Mohammedan, 
and he must turn to brute force to maintain himself 
in the luxury he loves. 

" And there are many things to make it hard for a 
conscientious Mohammedan to succeed in business. His 
religious observances alone take up so much valuable 
time. Five times a day he must go to the mosque to 
pray. How is it possible for a man to compete with 
others, in the face of such interruptions as that ? More- 
over, the whole teaching of the Koran is against the 
spirit of modern trade. So, too, is that of Christianity. 
But, as a rule, in commercial matters, Mohammedans 
conform to what their religion teaches them, while the 
Christians frequently do not. Certain precepts of the 
Prophet have moulded the lives of his followers, and 
purified their every-day dealings. All over Bosnia, a 
Mohammedan's word may be trusted in matters of buy- 
ing and selling. He is bloodthirsty and treacherous and 
cruel, but he will not lie or cheat or steal. Go into the 
Carcija in Serajevo, and buy from a Christian or a Jew, 
and you must haggle with him, for you may be sure that 
he will ask you three or four times the proper price; 
but it is not necessary to do so when you are buying 
from a Turk, for he will ask you only the real value of 
what he is selling." 

Mr. Thomson made some incursions into Herce- 
govina, Dalmatia, and Slavonia, and gives a few 
observations on these countries. He concludes his 
valuable work with a general review of the Eastern 
question and a vigorous arraignment of English 
policy. The book contains some good maps, and 
the illustrations are admirably clear, serviceable, 
and artistic. 

"A Ride Through Western Asia," by Clive Big- 
ham, is a summary sketch of a rapid trip through 
Asia Minor, Persia, Central Asia to China, and back 
by way of Siberia and Russia. The jottings on the 
earlier journeys seem somewhat perfunctory ; but 
the author shows greater interest in his Central 
Asian travels, and gives some useful information 
about Russian progress there. He notes that " Rus- 
sia does not colonize in the sense that England 
does ; she annexes and absorbs. In a comparatively 
short time after she has occupied a country and 
subdued the inhabitants, that country becomes an 
integral part of Russia and the inhabitants try to 
become Russians." The power of Russia lies in its 
militiarism, with the Czar at its head, who is prac- 
tically a deity to his people. Away to the northwest 
frontier of China, at Vierny, Mr. Bigham and com- 
panion attended a service at the Basilica on the 
" Imperial Name-Day." 

" We went into the church with an officer, and found 
it full of men in uniform. The Imperial prayer was 
being sung. The Bishop was standing on the altar 
steps making genuflexions, while a priest in the centre 
of the clmrch was chanting the prayer, his voice rising 
higher and higher as it proceeded. When he reached 
the last triumphant clause, ' Nicholas, son of Alexander,

tion joined in, the trumpets blared, and outside the 
field-guns boomed out one after the other. The effect 
was so splendid that one felt as if at a momentary 
glimpse the power of Russia was suddenly revealed." 

Mr. Bigham's account in general is too cursory, 
superficial, and matter-of-fact to be distinctly inter- 
esting; though it is evidently trustworthy as far as 
it goes. The book is provided with useful maps 
and illustrations. HlRAM M> STANLEY. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

It has often seemed surprising to us that the 
novelist, in his eager search for unexploited romantic 
material, should have made so little of one of the 
most interesting phases of the history of nineteenth- 
century Europe. The story of the Italian revolu- 
tionary movement, from the intrigues of Young 
Italy to the definitive setting of the seat of govern- 
ment upon the Quirinal, is full of such incidents as 
the novelist most desires, and is informed by 
motives of the sort that best lend themselves to the 
purposes of romantic fiction. The subject, as a 
whole, is hardly inferior to that of the French Revo- 
lution, yet the latter has furnished forth ten times 
as many historical novels as the former. The author 
of " The Gadfly," then, in taking for his theme the 
Italian conspiracies of the thirties and forties, has 
had the advantage of dealing with comparatively 
unhackneyed material, and we trust that his novel 
may be the forerunner of many others that shall 
deal with the same stirring period. Who Mr. E. L. 
Voynich may be we cannot say, but we have no 
hesitation in asserting that his novel is one of the 
strongest of the year, vivid in conception and dra- 
matic in execution, filled with intense human feel- 
ing, and worked up to a tremendously impressive

climax. The hero is a person whose life has been 
hopelessly embittered by deceit practiced upon his 
youth, and whom fierce sufferings, both physical and 
mental, have transformed from a dreamy and confid- 
ing boy into a reckless and cynical man, whose watch- 
word is the Voltairean ecrasez I'infdme, and who 
throws himself heart and soul into the struggle 
against priestcraft and tyranny. The book is ex- 
tremely outspoken at times, and will probably give 
to many of its readers the same sort of offence that 
is given, let us say, by such a poem as Mr. Swin- 
burne's " Before a Crucifix." The note of revolt 
is certainly very insistent and very shrill. Those 
who have a sense of the stern realities that underlie 
even the most traditionally sacred conventions of 
life will be able to enter into the spirit of this book 
and share the mood of the author ; those who have 
not that sense will probably read it with suspicion 
and shudder at its denouement. 

In " A Rose of Yesterday," Mr. Crawford pre- 
serves the unity of time in a rather remarkable way. 
The entire novel of more than two hundred pages 
is concerned with the happenings of a single day. 
These happenings, as may be surmised, are mostly 
conversations, and Mr. Crawford's skill in the man- 
agement of dialogue is too well known to need 
further emphasis. The subject of the talk is divorce, 
and the book is little more than a lengthy plea for 
the sanctity of the marriage relation, sometimes 
made by the heroine herself, sometimes by the au- 
thor in those disquisitions which he never hesitates 
to introduce when padding is needed. Mr. Craw- 
ford's facility in composition sometimes degenerates 
into mere carelessness, as in his description of " a 
young woman in black," who " received the pay- 
ments of passing customers with a grieved manner." 
The book is a very tame performance, and adds 
nothing to the reputation of the author as a serious 
novelist. 

" The Falcon of Lange*ac " ( but why the accent ?) 
is a story of the type made familiar by Mr. Stanley 
Weyman and other romancers of that school. The 
scene is partly in Brittany and partly in Mont St. 
Michel, the time that of Francis I. Historically, 
the book has been adorned with much conscientious 
detail, and while the plot shows slight powers of 
invention, the general effect is pleasing, an effect 
produced in large measure by the purity of the 
style. Mrs. Whiteley is to be congratulated upon 
a piece of honest workmanship, imbued with the 
true romantic spirit, and provided with the most 
picturesque of settings. 

There is a wealth of picturesque and romantic 
material for the novelist in the life of Spanish 
America, and the field is as yet almost wholly un- 
worked. Mr. Richard Harding Davis, in realizing 
the possibilities of this field, and in qualifying him- 
self for its cultivation by personal observation, has 
been enabled to produce a book that combines fresh- 
ness of interest with the excellent literary qualities 
otherwise to be expected of his work. His new 
" Soldiers of Fortune " is one of the most readable

and entertaining books of the season. Its chief 
characters are North Americans interested in a min- 
ing concession obtained from the government of 
Olancho, which lively little Republic appears to be 
situated somewhere on the coast near Venezuela. 
There is a fine revolutionary scrimmage in which 
the American hero gets mixed up, and as romantic 
a love-story as the youngest of readers could wish 
for. Indeed, the book appeals to uncritical youth 
rather than to adult sobriety, for the former is un- 
mindful of flaws that might easily mar the enjoy- 
ment of the latter, and a sort of irrepressible boy- 
ishness is the chief note of the narrative. 

Mr. M. Bourchier Sanf ord has found the material 
for an interesting narrative in the history of the 
Jesuit mission to the Hurons in the middle of the 
seventeenth century. The scene of the story is in 
the region which includes Sainte-Marie and St. 
Ignace, and the authorities for the historical part of 
the romance are, of course, the " Relations des 
Je'suites," as filtered through the pages of Parkman. 
The story is full of sympathy for the devotion and 
the heroism of the Jesuit fathers who spent laborious 
lives in the wilderness, and who shrank from no 
hardship and no danger in the performance of their 
task. In its' earlier chapters, the book is deficient 
in vitality, and it is not until near the close that the 
dry bones of historical fact are made to live in a 
narrative that engages our interests. The story has 
the same sort of charm that we find in Mrs. Gather- 
wood's work dealing with similar material, and is 
informed throughout by the loftiest ideals of conduct. 

" The Mutable Many " is a story that shows the 
hand of the trained journalist rather than the hand 
of the man of letters. There is no style to speak of, 
no genuine analysis of character, and but slight 
sense of the demands of literary art. But there is 
instead abundant action that does not flag, and a 
thoughtful presentation of a great social problem. 
There have been many other novels dealing with the 
conflict between labor and capital, but few that have 
done such even-handed justice to both aspects of the 
controversy, or that have produced the impression 
of being so closely in touch with the machinery of 
production, on the one hand, of strikes and labor 
organizations on the other. It is a far cry from 
" Put Yourself in His Place," for example, to this 
up-to-date study of a similar subject. The funda- 
mental passions concerned are much the same, but 
the conditions and the methods are so different now 
that Reade's novel is a matter of ancient history. 
Perhaps the best of Mr. Barr's characters is the 
artist in his own conceit, who plays but a minor part 
in the narrative, but whose appearance the reader 
soon learns to welcome. We are told at the start 
that Barney is a cad, and he probably is, but the 
epithet is inadequate, and we end with a real liking 
for him. Mr. Barr's method of story-telling sug- 
gests that of Sir Walter Besant in its breeziness 
and its actuality, thus deriving, in a measure, from 
Dickens himself. Entertainment, at least, may 
safely be promised the purchaser of this book. 



Mr. Frankfort Moore has been studying to good 
effect the manners and literary history of eighteenth- 
century England, and has turned out two books that 
are honestly, and almost brilliantly, written. " The 
Jessamy Bride " has Goldsmith for its central figure, 
and his romantic attachment for Mary Horneck for 
its theme. This part of the story is sweet, tender, 
and pathetic, and one can hardly read with dry eyes 
the closing pages, with their record of Goldsmith's 
death. The famous production of " She Stoops to 
Conquer " forms a leading episode of the work, and 
thereby introduces us to the pleasant company of 
the player-folk. Besides these Garrick, Colman, 
and Mrs. Abington we have sketches of the other 
people in Goldsmith's immediate circle, of Burke, 
Reynolds, Boswell, and the redoubtable Dr. Johnson. 
There is nothing better in the whole volume than 
the scene (in one of the early chapters) in which 
Garrick, disguised as a country clergyman, imposes 
upon the little group of Goldsmith's friends, and 
administers such a snub to the author of the " Dic- 
tionary " that we cannot help sharing in the awe- 
stricken mood of the hearers. Mr. Moore has 
imitated the ponderous Johnsonian manner with 
marked success, and has limned the other historical 
characters with much verisimilitude. His task was 
a daring one, but it is at least not so ill-performed 
as to make us regret the attempt. Mr. Moore's 
other book is a collection of six short stories, having 
for their leading figures such historical personages 
as the uxorious Duke of Marlborough and his wife, 
Nell Gwyn, Kitty Clive, Peg Woffington, and Sarah 
Siddons. The stories are well-conceived and amus- 
ing, bearing upon every page the impress of an 
intimate study of the fascinating period wherein 
they are laid. 

Mr. William J. Locke, the author of " Derelicts," 
is credited upon the title-page with two other nov- 
els, which we do not remember to have seen, but 
which we should certainly be glad to read if they 
in any measure approach his present performance. 
There is nothing novel about " Derelicts," either in 
plot or construction, and merely to summarize the 
story would give no notion of the true value of the 
book. The qualities that make it really noteworthy 
are the crystal purity of its style, the strength of 
its characterization, the delicacy and refinement of 
its motives, and its careful poise above the danger- 
ous depths of sensationalism on the one side, and 
sentimentalism on the other. It affords a sympa- 
thetic portrayal of warm human life, neither too 
idealized to lack substance, nor led too far astray 
into the thickets of realism to lose its distinctive 
character as artistic work. In theme, it is a study 
of guilt and expiation of a guilt that derives 
from weakness rather than from vicious predispo- 
sition, and of an expiation that is not merely exter- 
nal, but takes the form of a gradual and genuine 
upbuilding of character. It is not as strong a book, 
or as consummate a piece of workmanship, as Mr. 
Allen's "The Choir Invisible," but we cannot refrain 
from bringing the two books into juxtaposition, for

THE DIAL, 



[July 1, 



the author of one would understand the other, and 
both are refreshing and purifying in their influence. 
A few more such hooks as these would suffice to 
turn the stream of current fiction into channels less 
muddied than those in which it has been running of 
late years. 

William Massarene was an American from Da- 
kota. He was described in the vernacular of the 
northwest as " a bull-dozing boss," and enjoyed the 
soubriquet of the " Blasted Blizzard." He was an 
Irishman by birth, but emigrated to " the States " 
early in life, and amassed a colossal fortune by dis- 
reputable means. Having made his " pile," he 
crossed the Atlantic and set about the conquest of 
English society. Of his success in this noble ambi- 
tion we may read at great length in the latest work 
of fiction to bear the name of " Ouida " as its author. 
" The Massarenes " is, like most of the imaginings 
of that ingenious writer, a curious mixture of 
strength, cleverness, vulgarity, and pretentious igno- 
rance. Its good qualities save it from utter condem- 
nation ; its bad qualities are beneath contempt. In 
the predominance of the latter, it is something of a 
reversion to the author's older and worse manner, 
and its general tone of exaggerated sensationalism 
is quite unworthy of her. No one will be convinced 
that English society is so essentially corrupt as she 
would have us think, and no one will take very 
seriously her impossible " Mouse " and her equally 
impossible Lord Hurstmanceaux. There are so 
many misprints in the book that we must be care- 
ful about ascribing to " Ouida " all of the curious 
things that meet the eye ; it is possible that the 
printer is responsible for " the congenial country of 
mug-wamps and roarbacks," and even for "smelted 
gold," but even the printer could not have invented 
such bad French as " des bons gens." 

" The Fascination of the King " is an entertaining 
story of imaginary politics, the scene being laid in 
some unknown region of the Far East, and the hero 
being a European adventurer who has created a 
new State and made himself ruler thereof. How 
his throne is assailed, and how, with the help of 
some English friends, he quells the conspirator and 
repulses the foreign foe, are matters that are made 
highly exciting by Mr. Boothby's facile and prac- 
tised pen. The book is one of the lightly read and 
easily forgotten, but will serve for the occupation 
of a pleasant hour or two. 

The story of a sensitive nature, given up alter- 
nately to religious aspiration and debauchery, trying 
various ways of life, and making but poor success 
of them, is what we are given in " The Fool and 
His Heart." The story has neither symmetry of 
design nor distinction of style, and although the 
hero, in his better moods, appeals to our sympathies, 
his waywardness and weakness of will prevents us 
from greatly caring what becomes of him. The 
book derives a certain interest from the glimpses 
which it affords of the Catholic schools in which 
the hero is educated, and from the semi-Bohemian 



episodes of his subsequent career as a struggling 
novelist. But the execution as a whole is slovenly, 
and the ethical tone disheartening. 

" Christine of the Hills " is the story of a girl of 
Dalmatia, endowed with beauty and musical talent, 
who marries a brutal peasant before she knows 
what marriage means, and afterwards, believing 
her husband to have been shot, gives her heart to a 
nobleman who has befriended her. Presently the 
husband reappears, drags his reluctant wife away to 
Vienna, and lives upon her earnings as a singer. 
Mr. Max Pemberton has told this story prettily 
enough, but he is never quite successful in creating 
a strong situation, or in giving vitality to his pup- 
pets. The book is saved from insipidity by its 
romantic atmosphere and by the fascinating Dal- 
matian setting of its scene.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Mr. Bradnock Hall's "Fish-Tails 
. f ~ and Some True Ones (Edward 

Arnold) is a seasonable little book, 
wherein the author tells some good fishing yarns 
and chats pleasantly about his own angling experi- 
ences in Great Britain and Norway. Mr. Hall, as 
we gather, is an M.P., with a distressing, and, as 
he claims, undeserved, reputation for an almost 
puritanical sobriety. To this reputation he is, as a 
public man, of course obliged to live up. In sup- 
port of it, he has even put forth a book on " Bimet- 
allism as a Panacea for Pauperism " a dreary chef 
d'ceuvre which, he believes, nobody has ever read, 
and which he plainly regards with loathing. He is, 
in fact, a slave to his reputation as a serious man. 
The harmless relaxations of others would be re- 
garded as breaches of propriety in him lapses 
which might cost him his reputation and his seat in 
the House. " I must not," he complains, " be absent 
from my place in church, I must not play golf on 
Sunday, I must eschew clay pipes and beer, and 
books which others read with interest and enjoy- 
ment must not lie upon my table : in fact, I have 
to eat, drink, smoke, and read to order, and to 
travel three hundred miles to find a desert place 
to laugh in." In this country we do not regard our 
legislators so seriously. Fancy anybody here re- 
garding his " Congressman," or even his Senator, 
as necessarily and ex officio a paragon ! Mr. Hall 
admits that in private, and when he feels sure no- 
body is looking, he shakes off his shackles. In the 
safe retirement of his library he relaxes, indulges 
in refreshing and unhallowed pranks as Richard 
Swiveller used to relieve his feelings by stealthily 
flourishing a ruler over the head-dress of Miss Brass, 
when that maiden was safely engrossed with an Eject- 
ment or a Writ of Replevin. Mr. Hall's pranks 
have usually taken a literary form. " Oh," he ex- 
claims, " that you could have seen my Post-obiter

Dicta, or my Laughable Lyrics, by a Liliputian 
Laureate ! " Some of these trifles have even been 
surreptitiously published among them the papers 
embraced in the volume before us. They are, says 
the author, " some of the least trivial and the least 
slangy of their fellows." We find them crisp, 
readable, and chatty enough, and well suited to 
leaven the writer's undeservedly grievous reputa- 
tion. They are accompanied by some passable 
washed drawings by Mr. T. H. McLachlan, and 
there is an etched plate by the author. The Amer- 
ican " brother of the angle " will do well to slip Mr. 
Hall's little book in his satchel when next he goes 
a-fishing. 

A satirical Very chatty and piquant is the little 

French observer book entitled " A Diplomat in Lon- 
/ London life. don ( H olt), translated from the 
French of M. Charles Gavard. The author was, 
from 1871 to 1877, a member of the French 
Embassy at London, first as Chief Secretary, and 
then as Minister Plenipotentiary acting as Charge 
d 1 Affaires. M. Gavard was a notably shrewd and 
withal slightly satirical observer. His official posi- 
tion gave him opportunities scarcely second to those 
enjoyed by our courted fellow-countryman, Mr. 
Smalley, for studying at close range the smartest of 
England's " smart set." That he made good use 
of those opportunities, his notes and letters amus- 
ingly attest. M. Gavard's attitude, we may add, 
toward what " Mr. Guppy's " fashionable friend 
" Mr. Jobling " termed a " swanlike aristocracy " 
is by no means so deferential as is Mr. Smalley's. 
The habitual note of unctuous reverence, tinged with 
respectful familiarity, which pervades Mr. Smalley's 
reminiscences is not apparent in M. Gavard's 
sprightly and rather caustic pages. Of the two 
writers, it is seemingly the Frenchman who is the 
better republican. Mr. Smalley displays at times 
a strong Tory, almost a Jacobitical, bias ; M. Gavard 
can speak of Royalty itself in a most unconcerned 
way. He glances merely en passant at Mr. Smalley's 
friend the Prince as " a man of pleasure, a heavy 
drinker, a great eater, impecunious," and so on. 
He paints the Queen as " fat and short, with a dis- 
contented-looking face," and certainly no one 
familiar with the stock cuts in the London weeklies 
showing a stout, dissatisfied matron looking on 
crossly at the laying of this or that corner-stone 
or the genuflections of this or that Lord Mayor, 
will impeach the truth of his description. M. Gavard, 
like most Frenchmen, is disposed to make merry 
over English art. The older men he can endure, 
despite contrasts of color that remind him " of 
toast-and-jam." As for the moderns, he says, 
" molasses candy if that 's what you like, there 
you have it, and there the mob stays ; I was liter- 
ally sick." At an " afternoon " at Lady Burdett- 
Coutts's M. Gavard saw a masterpiece " represent- 
ing two thick-booted legs in air, incomprehensible 
and mediocre from the point of view of art." As 
with painting, so with music. At one entertainment 



M. Gavard records that he was regaled with the bag- 
pipes. " Nothing is impossible," he concludes, " in 
this absurd country." The impressions of this cul- 
tivated and observant Frenchman as to English poli- 
tics, art, manners, and humors, are graphic and amus- 
ing, and, in their light way, instructive. M. Gavard 
is very frank the more so, doubtless, as he clearly 
had no idea that his jottings would one day find their 
way into print. 

There are many matters of interest 
ind C cMecHng. that cluster about art which really 
have nothing to do with it as art. 
Just as an immense mass of scholarship gathers 
around every great name in literature, so there has 
gathered about the various fine arts, in the narrower 
meaning of the term, an immense mass of anecdot- 
age and gossip and technical information that is 
often very amusing and entertaining. Mr. Frederick 
S. Robinson, in his book on " The Connoisseur " 
(Longmans), has put together eighteen interesting 
chapters touching artists and works of art. The 
word " connoisseur " is a good one, for it means 
" one who knows." Connoisseurs are the cherubs 
of art, i. e., the second order in the hierarchy ; the 
seraphs, or those who love, coming first. Mr. Rob- 
inson is deeply interested and widely informed. It 
is true that he does not seem really to apprehend 
the essential character of his subject, for he begins 
with the inquiry, " What do lovers of art collect? " 
The real answer is that, as lovers of art, they collect 
nothing. When they collect, they become collectors 
or connoisseurs : not those who love, but those who 
know. This minor matter aside, however, Mr. 
Robinson will be allowed to write of collecting on a 
good large scale ; and some of his early chapters 
arouse a fine glow of pleasure. When he comes to 
Pliny and Vasari he seems to us not so happy ; for 
he can hardly be said to give, even remotely, an 
accurate idea of the work of either. If one is going 
to know about Pliny, one should begin, we think, by 
knowing something as to what it really was that 
he got together in his chapters on art. And as to 
Vasari, it is well to know that although he was a 
most estimable man, his work has drawbacks as a 
foundation for study. The chapters on Gems, how- 
ever, on Jewels, and on the Goldsmith and Silver- 
smith, do give us something of an idea of those very 
attractive minor arts. And the book as a whole is one 
which art-lovers will doubtless read with pleasure, 
although it can hardly be said to include a single 

artistic idea. 

We should like to see the admir- 
able little series of biographies of 
"Women of Colonial and Revolu- 
tionary Times," now issuing from the press of 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, placed within reach 
of every American woman. The books have the right 
ring. Their tone is sympathetic, yet critical ; they 
are evidently the fruit of patient reflection and re- 
search. They present in a concise and attractive 
way facts which a true American woman should

blush to be ignorant of. Patriotism needs, as it 
craves, a past of its own a national Golden Age of 
exemplary deeds and virtues, a heroic era which looms 
larger through the mists of time. It is not enough 
to feed the imagination on the annals of Greece and 
Rome. That America too has a past to be proud of, 
that American women need not look abroad for 
patterns of high conduct in the day of trial, these 
beautiful little volumes abundantly attest. The 
latest of the set is Mrs. Anne Hollingsworth 
Wharton's " Martha Washington." Mrs. Whar- 
ton's fluent and animated pen shows no signs of 
flagging ; and she has really succeeded in the diffi- 
cult task of making her worthy, if not in herself 
very brilliant or distinguished, heroine the chief 
figure of her own biography. One closes the book 
with a clear impression of Martha Washington as a 
distinct and not inconsiderable personality a 
stanch and devoted Virginian lady who decidedly 
counted for something even when viewed apart 
from her illustrious husband. To the high enter- 
prise of which he was the soul, and of which he re- 
mains the most splendid figure, she gave ungrudg- 
ingly all she had to give. Her counsels must have 
assisted in shaping his conduct; and his conduct 
was singularly beyond reproach. Mrs. Wharton's 
portrait of her is painstaking and truthful a real 
portrait, and not a fancy sketch of the conventional 
" Lady Washington " idealized in the spirit of a 
certain fad now prevalent. In following her hero- 
ine's career, Mrs. Wharton gives us incidentally 
some pleasing pictures of the manners of the time, 
notably as exemplified in the home-life of the Wash- 
ingtons. The little book is not only a capital one 
for popular reading : it cannot fail to win the ap- 
proval of the more critical. There is an attractive 
portrait, after the original painting by Woolaston. 

The most noteworthy characteristic 
* Professor Mach's " Contributions 
to the Analysis of Sensations " (Open 
Court Publishing Co.) is the point of view by which 
they are inspired, rather than the facts therein re- 
corded or the results reached. It is the point of 
view prominent in the writings of Helmholtz, and 
insists upon the essential unity of the underlying 
aspects of sensation and their causes. It is a point 
of view at once physical and psychological ; or, still 
better, it is the analysis of the essential nature of 
things underlying the methods and scope of both 
these sciences. Because physics was one science 
and psychology another and in many ways a totally 
different science, men seem to believe that the prov- 
inces of these two divisions of knowledge, their con- 
tent and fact-material, were necessarily diverse. 
Sensation is the common ground of physics and 
psychology, and, indeed, of physiology as well. The 
difference between these sciences, Professor Mach 
insists, is not that they deal with totally different 
phenomena but that they deal with them in different 
ways. When we are discussing the objective forms 
of energy by which our senses may be impressed, we 



are physicists ; when we are analyzing the nature of 
the impression thus made upon us, the manner of 
our becoming acquainted with our environment, we 
are psychologists. The study of sensations from all 
possible points of view, the union of physical and 
psychological methods, holds out the promise of a 
wider and deeper insight into the true nature of 
sensation than would ever be possible if we hold 
apart what should be brought together. This domi- 
nant note of warning was more necessary, because 
less familiar, a dozen years ago, when the original of 
the present translation appeared, than it is now ; the 
predicted rejuvenation of interest in the study of 
sensation has in the main come to pass, and along 
the lines suggested. The contents of Professor 
Mach's contributions will interest several classes of 
specialists, and it is a merited tribute to their inher- 
ent value to present them in an attractive English 
garb. It has been said of the late Professor Sylvester 
that in writing he stood very close to his subject, 
and made things large and important which others 
might be inclined to consider as of little consequence. 
Professor Mach has the same tendency ; and in both 
men it is the outcome of an enviable enthusiasm for 
their chosen subjects, which gives to their pages a 
spice that is often lacking in works of pure science. 
Both in manner and in matter, the little volume is a 
valuable contribution to the analysis of sensations. 

No English poet is more steeped in 
. classical mythology JJpn Spenser, 

and nowhere else can the purely E.n- 
glish student find so complete and attractive an 
exercise-book for the study of the subject as is 
afforded by the " Faerie Queene." As an aid in such 
study, Miss Alice E. Sawtelle has compiled a dic- 
tionary to the " Sources of Spenser's Classical Myth- 
ology " (Silver, Burdett & Co.), as her thesis for the 
doctor's degree at Yale University. The work seems 
to be very carefully done, and it is a great conven- 
ience to the student of Spenser to have at his hand 
so compact and orderly a presentation of the sub- 
ject, although little seems to be added to the knowl- 
edge presented in scattered notes by the various 
commentators and editors of the poet. We regret 
that Dr. Sawtelle has not carried out further the too- 
brief general introduction to her book, even at the 
risk of repeating in part some of the generalizations 
of Jortin, Warton, Percival, and other critics. Thus, 
it would be interesting to hear more in regard to 
such topics as the artistic methods employed by 
Spenser in handling his myths, the proportion of use 
and the sort of use made of the various classical 
poets, the kinds of myths he particularly affects and 
which he loves to elaborate, and the like. A serious 
omission in a field offering room for profitable re- 
search is the lack of investigation in the thesis into 
the subject of the coloring and the transmission of 
some of these myths to Spenser through the inter- 
mediary of the Italian literature of the Renaissance. 
We conjecture that a study of the annotations to 
Tasso, Ariosto, and Boiardo, as well as of the writ-

ings of some of the Italian Platonists and humanists, 
would contribute to the rather scanty information 
now supplied us in relation to such topics as the 
Garden of Adonis, the story of Hippolytus and 
^Esculapius, and the dreaded name of Demogorgon. 
The last especially is a mysterious and interesting 
figure in literature, appearing in the verse not only 
of Spenser, but also of Milton, Dryden, Shelley, and 
other English poets ; and yet the classical diction- 
aries and Dr. Sawtelle give us very little help in 
regard to him. Besides the quotation from Dr. 
Jortin, Dr. Sawtelle might well have added the brief 
passage on Demogorgon from Milton's Latin writ- 
ings cited in Todd's Milton in the note to Paradise 
Lost, Book II., line 964. 

If easy writing makes hard reading, 
U * niay be that what is written at 

random will be read with concen- 
trated interest. The reader curious in the question 
may like to experiment with Mr. L. F. Austin's 
" At Random" (Ward, Locke & Co.). Our own 
experience in this case was that we read the book 
much as it was written. In the last essay (if they 
be essays) the author tells how he met Olivia, a 
sparkling journalist, gazing into the window of a 
print-shop. She used to go there to look for ideas. 
Such, we fancy, must be the fate of anyone who has 
to write a weekly column about things in general. 
From such columns Mr. Austin's book is made up, 
but we do not feel quite sure whither he went in 
search of ideas. Sometimes, obliviously, it was to 
the theatre ; sometimes it was to what he calls Mr. 
Judson of the Dog- Licensing Department ; often 
he seems to have merely looked out of the window 
of some club. A few ideas he has got from America : 
American cider he thinks bad ; American after- 
dinner speeches begin during the oysters ; he was 
once cajoled and deceived by an American female 
interviewer. But practically his subject-matter is 
whatever you choose ; it is the treatment that is 
really the thing. Each number is a series of sections 
of about the same length, commonly of one para- 
graph each, with an indented heading and a few 
leads between every two. This literary form, as 
our readers are aware, allows the essayist much 
opportunity for easy badinage, good-natured satire, 
and quaint common-sense. We have already ex- 
pressed the opinion in these columns that such con- 
versation, while excellent in its weekly place, is 
hardly worth preserving. 



Criticism and 
preaching. 



In " The Old Testament and Modern 
Life " (Dodd, Mead & Co.), the Rev. 
Stopford Brooke endeavors in a se- 
ries of sermons to show that the modern critical 
view of the Old Testament is not incompatible with 
its use as a moral and spiritual guide for this age. 
That he has been successful in this attempt is, on 
the whole, questionable. The ideas of people in 
general about the application of criticism to the Old 
Testament are so indefinite that sermons prepared 



from this critical point of view have to admit too 
much of the apparatus of the scholar. The moral 
and spiritual emphasis is constantly weakened by 
acknowledgments that this or that story is mythical 
or legendary, or by defence and exposition of crit- 
ical results. The hearer's degree of appreciation 
and the impulses toward better living are in fact 
limited in such a case to the influence of the person- 
ality of the preacher. When all this has been said, 
it remains true that such a book helps toward a truer 
appreciation of the Old Testament, and thus lays 
the foundation for more successful achievements in 
the same direction. It is especially interesting to 
students of the religious life of our time. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. Henry I. Sheldon's "Notes on the Nicaragua 
Canal " (McClurg) comprise a brief descriptive account 
of this project by a man who has evidently made a care- 
ful first-hand examination of the route, and has become 
thoroughly convinced of both the desirability and feasi- 
bility of the canal. This book discusses the subject in 
all aspects, legislative, sanitary, and financial, and con- 
veys much useful information in a modest way. The 
volume is furnished with sketch-maps and some good 
illustrations. 

With commendable promptitude the second volume of 
Messrs. Britton and Brown's " Illustrated Flora of the 
Northern United States, Canada, and the British Posses- 
sions " (Scribner) follows upon the first, which we praised 
in the highest terms when it appeared last winter. A third 
volume, soon to follow, will complete the work. There 
is little to say upon the present occasion beyond the 
reiteration of our former praises, and the statement 
that we are now taken through the Orders of the Chori- 
petalfe (polypetalous flowers) and part way into the 
Gamopetalse. The volume before us include Orders 
20 to 92 of the former series, and Orders 1 to 16 of the 
latter. The work should be in every school library, as 
a matter of course, and no summer house in the country, 
the home of an educated family, can afford to omit it 
from the furnishings. 

Dr. Henry Sweet's " Student's Dictionary of Anglo- 
Saxon " (Macmillan) is a volume of about two hundred 
pages, which will serve as a makeshift pending the 
hoped-for completion of the exhaustive Bosworth-Toller 
work. It comes chiefly into competition with Dr. Clark 
Hall's dictionary, which Dr. Sweet pronounced " ter- 
ribly uncritical." Condensation and trustworthiness (as 
far as the work goes) are the objects chiefly aimed at 
in the preparation of the present work. 

The Venezuelan Commission send us an instalment 
of their " Report upon the True Divisional Line between 
the Republic of Venezuela and British Guiana." Two 
volumes are now published, one of text and one of 
maps. The text is devoted to the geography of the 
subject, and includes six papers, by expert writers, upon 
the maps of the territory in dispute. The accompanying 
atlas contains seventy-six maps, fifteen of which are 
new, the others being facsimile reproductions of old 
ones. As an example of book-making, this work does 
great credit to the Government Printing Office, and 
stands in striking contrast to most of the productions 
that come from that source.

H. Mace's " Method in History for Teachers and Stu- 
dents," a work of considerable pedagogical helpfulness. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. are about to issue, in 
conjunction with the English publishers, the first volume 
of the " History of the Royal Navy," to be completed in 
five volumes. 

The very interesting chapters of General Horace 
Porter's recollections of his " Campaigning with Grant," 
lately running in " The Century," will be issued in book 
form in the autumn. 

A study of Simms, by Mr. Samuel A. Link, appears 
in the interesting series of pamphlets on " Pioneers of 
Southern Literature," published by Messrs. Barbee & 
Smith, Nashville, Tenn. 

" Germany," by Mrs. Kate Freiligrath Kroeker, and 
" England," by Miss Frances E. Cooke, are two volumes 
in the " History for Young Readers " series, published 
by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

" The American Journal of Archaeology," published 
by the Macmillan Co., begins a second series this sum- 
mer, and will be published six times a year, instead of 
four as hitherto. Professor John H. Wright is editor- 
in-chief. 

" A Brief Account of the Establishment of the Colony 
of Georgia, under General James Oglethorpe, Feb- 
ruary 1, 1733," is the second in the series of " Ameri- 
can Colonial Tracts," published by Mr. George P. 
Humphrey. 

Publication of the English text of the " Polychrome " 
Bible will be begun in the autumn. It is stated that 
Professor Haupt intends to secure the services of the 
Rev. John Watson in translating certain portions of the 
work into the Scotch dialect. 

" The Westminster Press " is the style of imprint 
hereafter to be used for those publications of the Pres- 
byterian Board that are not denominational in character. 
Mr. John H. Scribner remains in general charge of the 
publishing business of the house. 

" The Theory of Electricity and Magnetism, being 
Lectures on Mathematical Physics," is the title of a 
voluminous treatise by Dr. Arthur Gordon Webster, 
Director of the Physical Laboratory of Clark Univer- 
sity. The work is published by the Macmillan Co. 

An " Annotated Bibliography of Fine Art," in which 
Mr. Russell Sturgis has the subjects of painting, sculp- 
ture, architecture, decoration, and illustration, while 
Mr. H. E. Krebbiel takes the department of music is 
published by the Library Bureau for the American 
Library Association. Such books as these are of the 
greatest usefulness, and the present example can hardly 
be commended too highly. 



Messrs. Morton, Bliss, & Co., 38 Nassau St., New 
York, are the designated American agents for the 
Thomas Hughes Memorial Fund, and subscriptions from 
this country are solicited by them, as well as by a dis- 
tinguished committee of educators and divines. The 
objects of the Fund are to erect a statue of Judge 
Hughes and to provide endowments for the Rugby 
School Missions in London and Birmingham. 

The poems of Mrs. Anne Bradstreet, who is called 
" the first American authoress," are about to be repub- 
lished, with an introduction by Professor Norton, by the 
book club known as " The Duodecimos," whose treasurer 
is Mr. Irving Way, Monadnock Building, Chicago. The 
edition is to be limited to 144 copies, of which 132 will 
be offered for sale at $12.50 each. A previous publi- 
cation by this club, " Poor Richard's Almanack," is now 
quoted at $35 a copy. 

The June number of the " Publications of the Amer- 
ican Statistical Association " will contain the address on 
Francis Amasa Walker, delivered by Colonel Carroll D. 
Wright at the Quarterly Meeting of the Association, 
April 16, 1897. This number will also contain a care- 
fully prepared bibliography of General Walker's writ- 
ings. Copies may be had from the Secretary of the 
American Statistical Association, 491 Boylston Street, 
Boston, at fifty cents each. 

A circular, just issued by the Dante Society, sums up 
the work done by that organization during the fifteen 
years of its existence, outlines the tasks that it hopes to 
perform in the near future, and appeals " to lovers of 
Dante and of poetry for an increase in the member- 
ship." The annual fee is five dollars, and any person 
interested in the objects of the Society may become a 
member by sending his name and one year's subscrip- 
tion to the Secretary, Professor A. R. Marsh, Cam- 
bridge, Mass. 

The recently organized Chicago Society of Egyptian 
Research appeals to the public for annual memberships 
at five dollars each, and for personal subscriptions of 
larger amounts. Each member will receive the large 
illustrated volume to be published annually by the 
Society. The Chicago Society will also come into pos- 
session of a share of the antiquities unearthed by Mr. 
Petrie, in whose hands the expenditure of the funds will 
be placed. Mrs. Hart Rawson, 5854 Rosalie Court, 
Chicago, is authorized to receive subscriptions. 

The Princeton Sesquicentennial has already borne lit- 
erary fruit in the shape of a volume containing Profes- 
sor Dowden's lectures (which we shall review at a later 
date), and in three booklets containing other lectures 
given upon that occasion. They are " Two Lectures 
on Theism," by Professor Andrew Seth; two on "The 
Claims of the Old Testament," by Professor Stanley 
Leathes ; and one upon " The Descent of the Primates," 
by Professor A. A. W. Hubrecht. Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons are the publishers of all these volumes. 

" Dans la Brume," the latest novel by M. Le*on de 
Tinseau, evinces once more the author's frequently- 
declared admiration for American ways and American 
life, and will on that account, if on no other, find many 
appreciative readers in this country. The heroine is a 
Chicago woman, and it is interesting to learn that in 
delineating her the author had constantly in mind the 
late Mrs. George Rowswell Grant, whose acquaintance 
he made in Paris several years ago. It is not a portrait 
that he offers us, but a sketch that is at least in many 
ways suggestive.

A NSW WORK BY DEAN FARRAR. 

THE BIBLE: 

ITS MEANING AND SUPREMACY. 

By F. W. FARRAR, D.D., F.R.S., DEAN OF CANTERBURY, author of 

" Darkness and Dawn," " Gathering Clouds," etc. Large crown 8vo, 

gilt top, 376 pages, $2.00. 

" His spirit is liberal and kindly and earnest, his literary style is limpid and 
charming, and his volume is sure to be more or less helpful to all. The book is the 
work of a man who is a master of clear English, who is not afraid to let himself 
think, and who dares to let the breath of the times blow through his pages." 
Chicago Tribune. 

" We do not hesitate to say that a book like this, written by a man who believes 
.first in Christianity and then in the main results of modern criticism, was needed, 
and that Dean Farrar has furnished it better than any other man has done before 
him.'' Church Standard. 

A WOMAN'S PART IN A REVOLUTION. 

By Mrs. JOHN HAYS HAMMOND. 12mo, cloth, 144 pages, $1.00. 

" It is a concise, clear review of the situation, sharp and pointed in its criticism, 
and withal lenient, and lacking in the bitterness that would be expected. It is an 
interesting story, told with great vivacity and directness." Inter Ocean, Chicago. 

" It is rare that humor and pathos are so happily blended as in the personal 
experiences of Mrs. John Hays Hammond. Her humor is pithy and crisp, and her 
pathos is of the genuine kind, rarely permitted to appear in books purporting to be 
autobiographical. ... A delightful book, a vivid and entertaining account of a 
picturesque episode in recent history, and a charming revelation of what a good wife 
can be." Argonaut, San Francisco, Cal. 

A HANDBOOK OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. 

By AUSTIN DOBSON. New Edition, Revised, with new chapters, and ex- 
tended to the present time by W. HALL GRIFFIN, B.A., Professor of 
English Language and Literature at Queen's College, London. Crown

tion and Progress." 8vo, 553 pages, $4.50. 

CROMWELL'S PLACE IN HISTORY: 

Founded on Six Lectures delivered at Oxford. By S. R. GARDINER, D.C.L., 
Ford's Lecturer in English History, 1896. Crown 8vo, $1.00. 

NUMERICAL PROBLEMS IN PLANE GEOMETRY. 

With Metric and Logarithmic Tables. By J. G. ESTILL of the Hotchkiss 

School, Lakeville, Conn. 12mo, 154 pages, 90 cts. net. 

" The most of the problems have had classroom test. They add interest to the 
study and are helpful in making clear and fastening in the memory the principles 
and propositions of formal geometry. These problems are not to take the place of 
other geometries, but to be used with them ; the division into books, therefore, is 
made to correspond pretty closely with that of the geometries in most general use. 
No other book contains a graded set of problems on the first two books of geometry. 
Boys preparing for college will certainly take a lively interest in the questions, 
problems, and exercises selected from the college entrance papers, which were 
selected with great care, with the hope that they might prove helpfully suggestive 
both to teachers and pupils." Extract from Author' 1 s Preface. 

MEMOIRS OF BARON LEJEUNE,

THE SPOILS OF POYNTON. 

By HENRY JAMES, author of " The Portrait of a Lady," 
etc. 12mo, $1.50. 

" One gets from Mr. James's work at its best an intimation of per- 
fection, a deep consciousness that there is something so fine that it 
could not be bettered ; and this consciousness becomes almost over- 
whelming to the reader of ' The Spoils of Poynton.' " The Critic, 
New York. 

THE WISDOM OF FOOLS. 

By Mrs. DELAND, author of " John Ward, Preacher," 
" Philip and His Wife," " Mr. Tommy Dove," etc. 
Second Edition. 16mo, $1.25. 

" The literary skill and finish of Mrs. Deland's book cannot be too 
highly praised. But in spite of its humor, its finesse, its artistic skill, 
it is the matter rather than the method of it that will impress you, and 
you will not be able to escape from its influence easily. It is a work 
of unusual power, in some lights absolutely marvellous for its depth of 
intimate perceptions and intuitional divination." Brooklyn Eagle. 

A TRANSATLANTIC CHATELAINE. 

By HELEN C HO ATE PRINCE, author of " The Story of 
Christine Rochefort." Second Edition. 16mo, $1.25. 
" The heroine's peculiar history on each side of the ocean is most 

interesting, and the author has drawn in her a distinct and delightful 

character." The Congregationalist, Boston. 

THE SPIRIT OF AN ILLINOIS TOWN, AND 
THE LITTLE RENAULT. 

By MARY HARTWELL CATHERWOOD, author of " The 
Lady of Fort St. John," " Old Kaskaskia," etc. Sec- 
ond Edition. 16mo, $1.25. 

" Mrs. Catherwood has done no finer work than in 'The Spirit of an 
Illinois Town,' which has a combination of masculine vigor and fem- 
inine delicacy rare to find." The Literary World, Boston. 

MISS ARCHER ARCHER. 

By CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM, author of " The Wise 
Woman," etc. Sixth Thousand. 16mo, $1.25. 
" A cool, quiet, delicious love-story, with the most natural and lov- 
able of men and women, amid attractive surroundings. " Buffalo Com- 
mercial. 

THE DAY OF HIS YOUTH. 

By ALICE BROWN, author of " Meadow Grass," " By 
Oak and Thorn," etc. 16mo, $1.00. 

" A book quite out of the ordinary, written with a distinct charm of 
style." The Outlook, New York. 

" An exquisite piece of work." Cincinnati Commercial-Tribune. 
" An extraordinarily strong story." Minneapolis Journal. 

THE BURGLAR WHO MOVED PARADISE. 

By HERBERT D. WARD, author of " The White Crown, 

and Other Stories." 16mo, $1.25; Riverside Paper 

Series, 50 cts. 

Good readers will remember Miss Phelps's stories, " An Old Maid's 
Paradise "and "Burglars in Paradise." Mr. Ward has taken posses- 
sion of Paradise, and in this entertaining book tells how it was moved 
by water. It is an excellent Summer book. 

" The ability to write a book that is bright and laughable without 
being silly is not common, but Mr. Ward has given abundant evidence 
that he possesses just the qualities for so desirable an undertaking. 
Every chapter is full of delicious humor, yet not at all forced or over- 
strained, and with it all there is a vein of earnestness." Boston Beacon.

THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH 
ONCE MORE. 

The teaching of English in our universities 
is a subject that has reached an acute phase of 
discussion of recent years, and in that discus- 
sion THE DIAL, as our readers know, has had 
its share. Still more recently, the discussion 
seems to have shifted its ground from the field 
of higher to that of secondary education, and 
pedagogical interest in the subject is now cen- 
tred upon the work of the preparatory schools 
and upon the admission requirements of the 
colleges. While both the theory and the prac- 
tice of the subject are still in a tentative and 
transitional state, it may be affirmed that we 
are at last on the way toward something like 



uniformity of methods and ideals, and that 
from the now seemingly chaotic condition of 
affairs something like a definite set of conclu- 
sions is on the way toward emergence. 

In " The School Review " for June we are 
provided with the means for taking as distinct 
a view of this important matter as it is possible 
at present to gain, and we propose to glance at 
the subject in the light of the documentary evi- 
dence there collected. The report of Dr. A. F. 
Nightingale as Chairman of the Denver Com- 
mittee on College Entrance Requirements, the 
report of Mr. J. E. Russell on the subject of 
Requirements in English, and the report of 
Mr. C. W. French on the English Conference 
of May 31, are the three documents upon which 
we have drawn, and an examination of their 
contents will be found both helpful and sug- 
gestive. 

The English Conference in question was 
held in New York, and the participants were a 
committee of fifteen delegates from the five 
associations of secondary schools and colleges 
that have played so important a part in the 
educational activity of recent years, and that 
are doing so much to make us hopeful of real 
progress in the matter of intermediate and 
higher education. Considerable differences of 
opinion were developed in the Conference, and 
adjournment until next December was had 
without outlining any permanent policy. It is 
interesting, however, to learn that " the speak- 
ers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that 
there should be no difference between the reg- 
ular and college-preparatory courses in En- 
glish." The discussion was for the most part 
focussed upon a series of resolutions presented 
by Mr. French. These resolutions called for a 
full four years of preparatory work, and offered 
a scheme for each of the four years. The 
scheme embodied one year of rhetoric and 
composition, one devoted to the history of the 
English language, and two devoted to a histor- 
ical survey of English literature. It also pro- 
vided for continuous essay-writing and for con- 
tinuous reading, both intensive and cursory, of 
carefully selected books. The resolutions also 
called for a settlement of college entrance 
requirements upon the basis of the work called 
for by the above scheme, and urged the adop- 
tion of a list " of not less than one hundred and 



36 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



fifty books " from which preparatory schools 
might select the required reading for their 
courses. 

This last resolution, which is perhaps the 
most important of all, and which is certainly a 
step in the right direction, seemed to meet with 
scant favor, since about the only thing defi- 
nitely done by the Conference was the adoption 
of a brief and narrow fixed list for 1901 and 
1902, this being substantially the list hitherto 
adopted for 1900. Dr. Nightingale, who was 
not present at the meeting, sent a letter in ad- 
vocacy of what we believe to be the wiser policy 
of elasticity and latitude in the matter of 
required reading. This letter urges the adop- 
tion of long lists of books for both kinds of 
reading. Such questions as the following will 
not down, however conferences may try to sup- 
press them. " Why designate a particular set 
for 1897, another for 1898, and so on ? Why 
not present a list good until 1905, for ' read- 
ing ' and for ' study and practice ' out of which 
selections may be made according to the judg- 
ment of the school ? " Why not, indeed ? The 
only reason which the partisans of rigidity have 
to offer is that college examiners would find it 
difficult to shape their questions with reference 
to such an extended list. " Oh, the farce and 
the folly," Dr. Nightingale exclaims, " of shap- 
ing requirements for admission to college for 
the purpose of facilitating the making of exam- 
ination questions ! " 

We are in hearty agreement with this posi- 
tion, and always ready to share the indignation 
of those who protest against rigid uniformity in 
anything but the veriest essentials of educa- 
tional policy. As for this particular policy of 
uniform reading, devised solely in the interest 
of the examiner, and almost fatal to the work 
of the instructor, it recalls nothing so much as 
the puerile plea of Mr. Dingley in defence of 
his recent atrocious proposal for the taxation 
of knowledge. It will never do, he said in sub- 
stance, to permit books of any kind to enter the 
country without taxation, because we cannot 
expect our overworked customs officials to 
waste their energies in determining whether 
books are more than twenty years old, or in 
what language they are printed. It is much 
simpler to clap a tax upon them all, and spare 
the tax-collector at the expense of all the stu- 
dents and readers in the land. Or, if this 
parallel be not sufficient, another may be found 
in Lamb's famous essay on the economical 
Chinese method of roasting pig. 

Mr. Russell's interesting report is largely in 



tabulated form, being based upon the replies to 
two circulars of inquiry sent to about three 
hundred teachers of English in the secondary 
schools and colleges. A few of the results of 
this investigation may be given. The first 
questions called for an opinion concerning the 
satisfactoriness of the present entrance require- 
ments, which are considered satisfactory by 
large majorities. The number of years of pre- 
paratory work needed to meet these require- 
ments is variously estimated at from one to four, 
the term of two years receiving the largest 
number of votes. These replies taken together 
seem to indicate a lower standard than should 
prevail. The preparatory work in English 
should certainly call for three or four years of 
study. An overwhelming majority of votes 
were recorded in favor of the proposition that 
in the selection of books for the required work, 
the governing principles should be : (1) the 
representation of distinct periods and types of 
literature, (2) the consideration of historical 
sequence, and (3) the equal representation of 
prose and poetry. Opinions were solicited con- 
cerning the fitness of the books in a list of 
forty-four, compiled from the actual require- 
ments of different colleges. Each book is 
marked as desirable, very desirable, unsatisfac- 
tory, or very unsatisfactory. " The Merchant 
of Venice " is the only book in the list that does 
not get a single vote under the two adverse 
categories. Those that come next in accepta- 
bility are " Miles Standish," " Evangeline," 
" Ivanhoe," " Julius Caesar," " The Lady of 
the Lake," " Marmion," " The Sketch Book," 
and " The Vision of Sir Launf al." Among the 
very desirable books are also " As You Like 
It," " Macbeth," and "Silas Marner." The 
most unsatisfactory book in the list is Defoe's 
" History of the Plague," the adoption of which 
by the colleges has always been a dark mys- 
tery. One hundred and seventy-eight votes 
are cast against it, and only thirty-seven in its 
favor. Other books that get at least fifty ad- 
verse votes (out of from three to five times that 
number) are " Comus," Pope's " Iliad," " Ly- 
cidas," Dryden's " Palamon and Arcite," and 
Macaulay's " Second Essay on Chatham." The 
majority of the books in the list are ratified 
by decided majorities. A question calling for 
additional suggestions elicited two hundred 
titles, among which Tennyson's " Idylls of 
the King " received twenty-four suffrages, 
Emerson's " Essays " twenty-one, Franklin's 
" Autobiography " thirteen, " The Deserted 
Village," " The Essays of Elia," and " Henry 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



37 



Esmond " each twelve, and " Hamlet " ten. 
A second circular of inquiry sent out by 
Mr. Russell included questions of more gen- 
eral scope, and elicited some interesting ex- 
pressions of opinion. The vote was almost 
unanimous that English should be pursued by 
all classes in the high school during the entire 
course, but opinion was about evenly divided 
between three, four, and five periods per week 
for the time allotment. A large majority voted 
for basing composition work chiefly upon the 
required reading. Exercises in paraphrasing 
poetry, correcting bad English, and condensa- 
tion were all recommended by fair majorities. 
Opinion was rather against the formal study 
of English literary history, and very strongly 
against courses in Anglo-Saxon and Early En- 
glish. Rhetoric and formal grammar as sepa- 
rate studies received large votes, but again 
opinion was very much at sea when it came to 
fixing the year in which these studies should 
best be pursued. Some of the questions were 
of such a nature that the replies to them did not 
admit of statistical presentation. In one case, 
for example, the replies " show a widespread 
dissatisfaction with the English requirement 
even by those who accept it tentatively as the 
best possible at the present time." And the 
question which called for a statement of the 
main objects to be sought in the teaching of 
secondary English showed so great a diversity 
of opinion that we may well conclude that the 
real difficulty lies just here, and that we can- 
not expect anything but chaos in our work 
until we are substantially agreed upon what it 
is most desirable to do. The answers to this 
question ranged all the way from " the analysis 
of a typical English sentence " to a " famili- 
arity with the greatest minds of all times," 
although from them all five ideals emerged in 
the following order of emphasis : *' Habits of 
good expression, oral and written," " a taste for 
good literature," " an acquaintance with the 
outlines of English literature," " culture and 
discipline," and " the ability to read under- 
standingly." These are all worthy aims, no 
doubt, and if agreement can once be had upon 
their relative importance, we may well relegate 
to the limbo of the unimportant most of the 
other questions raised by the investigation now 
under consideration. " If the main objects of 
teaching English are attained," to conclude 
our discussion with Mr. Russell's most perti- 
nent closing inquiry, " what matters it to the 
colleges, or to anyone outside of the schools, 
what list of books is studied ? " 



SHAKESPEARE IN CHICAGO, II* 

The dramatic record of the past year in Chicago 
is an average one. It has been rather interesting 
to note the frequency with which adaptations of 
popular works of fiction have held the stage, and 
this tendency in dramatic productions may have 
some significance for one who at all studies the 
theatre of to-day. Old-time melodrama of the type 
represented by " Monte Cristo " and " The Man in 
the Iron Mask," based on popular French romance, 
has held its own and shows some new development. 
To the unreasonable popularity of " Trilby " in its 
barbarous stage version of the past two seasons is 
undoubtedly due the attempt of Mr. Clyde Fitch to 
reconstruct "Bohemia" out of Miirger's romance. 
" The Prisoner of Zenda " has pursued its triumphal 
course, with the adaptation of Mr. Townsend's 
" Chimmie Fadden " as an odd competitor for pub- 
lic favor. Miss Phipps's " A Social Highwayman " 
has achieved success in the hands of the Hollands, 
and Mr. Theodore Hamilton's work in " Pudd'n- 
head Wilson " has won public approval. Mr. Stuart 
Bobson has also made a success in the dramatization 
of Opie Head's " The Jucklins." Most interesting 
of all has been the appearance of Mr. Mansfield in 
" The Scarlet Letter," and that of Mrs. Marlowe- 
Taber in Mr. Barren's arrangement of " Romola." 

In comparing the season just closed with that of 
1895-96, we find an apparent lessening of interest 
in the Shakespearian drama. However, the season 
of 1895-96 was a remarkable one in this respect, 
and the mere falling off in the number of plays 
presented should not be regarded as especially sig- 
nificant. The following facts are noteworthy. 
While in the previous season eighty-eight Shake- 
spearian presentations are recorded, such presenta- 
tions number sixty-eight for the season of 1896-97; 
the number of plays staged, however, is the same in 
both seasons thirteen. "Julius Csesar," " Two 
Gentlemen of Verona," " Macbeth," and " Mid- 
summer Night's Dream," included in the repertory 
of 1895-96, were replaced by " Much Ado About 
Nothing," " Cymbeline," " King Lear," and " The 
Tempest." " Hamlet," which received twenty-six 
representations in the season before the last, was 
given but six in 1896-97. "The Merchant of 
Venice " also fell from a record of eleven to one of 
five. " Othello," presented eight times in 1895-96, 
was staged but once the past season ; a similar state- 
ment holds for " The Taming of the Shrew," which 
in 1895-96 was given ten times. On the other 
hand, " Richard III." was brought out seven times 
in each season, while "Romeo and Juliet" received 
fourteen presentations during the past year as 
against four in that preceding. The notable fea- 
tures of 1896-97 were undoubtedly the revival of 
"King Lear" by Frederick Warde, and that of

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

"A PHILOSOPHER DECADENT." A REPLY. 
(To the Editor of THIS DIAL.) 

Mr. Camillo von Klenze's remarks on the translations 
of Volumes VIII. and XI. of the English version of 
Nietzsche's Works, in THE DIAL for June 16, can hardly 
be allowed to pass unnoticed. When approaching the 
end of his article, he seems to have suddenly bethought 
himself that it is always the proper thing for a reviewer 
to portion out strong doses of praise and blame. He 
deals out these articles in a great hurry, like a person 
who has been kept beyond his hours, and is anxious to 
get home. I happen to get the strong dose of blame. 
Of my translation, which compares at least favorably 
enough with the one he praises, he says, "It is bad 
throughout, and in parts ignominious"; and after fur- 
nishing what purports to be a list of bad and ignominous 
passages, he adds, " Such things ought never to be 
printed." 

But none of the four errors which he adduces as bad 
and ignominious are errors at all, except in the imagina- 
tion of a person in a flurried state of mind. He errone- 
ously refers to a passage as on page 9 (it is on page 19 
in the English edition), where he thinks I have com- 
mitted the terrible blunder of putting is instead of are. 
I insist, however, on the authority of grammarians (e. g. t 
Bain in his " Higher English Grammar ") that is is per- 
fectly correct in the passage, " In his art there is mixed, 
in the most seductive manner, the things at present 
most necessary for everybody the three great stimu- 
lants of the exhausted." (A discussion of the same 
trivial question, which the " Saturday Review " justly 
ridicules, has been going on in a London newspaper, 
with reference to the expression used by Mr. Jerome K. 
Jerome, " A good woman's arms ... is a life-belt.") 

I am further blamed for translating Romane as ro- 
mances, which is certainly not an incorrect rendering. 
Neither is it erroneous to use the expression, "prohibit 



themselves every ' if ' and for,' " when the Germans are 
spoken of in contrast to the " aesthetic gentlemen " who 
used " if " and " for." (I understand that themselves is 
objected to, as redundant, which it certainly is not.) In 
the next passage I am blamed for preserving a metaphor 
by translating it literally, though not obscurely. Besides 
preserving the metaphor, the literal rendering seems 
best suited to the context. Here, however, Mr. von 
Klenze again falls into an incidental mistake when he 
gives the original as " Ich weiss nicht wo aus noch ein." 
The wo is redundant, and is not in the original. 

I know only too well that there are sufficient imper- 
fections in my translation, but in being the first to un- 
dertake voluntarily a difficult and important work (Dr. 
Haussmann, the translator of the " Genealogy of Morals," 
was the second to voluntarily undertake and complete 
a translation of one of Nietzsche's volumes), I do not 
wish to be blamed for things which are not real errors. 

Apart, however, from his concluding paragraph, 
which is a curiosity in criticism, Mr. von Klenze's arti- 
cle on Nietzsche's philosophy is valuable on the whole. 
It is an immense advance on the criticism in Nordau's 
" Degeneration," and on some of the earlier criticisms of 
Nietzsche which appeared in English (e. g., the dis- 
graceful attack on Nietzsche which appeared in the 
" International Journal of Ethics " for July, 1892, 
p. 533). Surely, however, Mr. von Klenze insists too 
dogmatically on Nietzsche's lack of the historical sense. 
The course of social development from the Renaissance 
to the present time is far too brief and exceptional to 
furnish data from which we can deduce with certainty 
the permanency of democratic institutions. Others than 
Mr. John Morley, who believe in democratic institutions, 
would do well to study Machiavelli, to whom, along 
with Thucydides, Nietzsche claims to be nearest akin. 

Nietzsche's careful distinction, also, between hose 
(evil) and schlecht (bad) seems hardly to be grasped by 
Mr. von Klenze. The word evil should therefore be 
substituted for bad in the passage: "'Good' in other 
words is tantamount to harmless, ' tad ' to strong, pow- 
erful." We find Nietzsche almost continually contem- 
plating moral phenomena of one kind or other in his 
voluminous writings ; it is therefore not at all correct to 
say, " These revolutionary views Nietzsche does not 
base on a careful comparative study of morality, but on 
the etymology of a few words." THOMAS COMMON.

WHAT ARE "SURVIVALS" AND "ARCHAISMS"? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

The discussion concerning the use of the verbs "learn" 
and " teach " reveals, as it seems to me, a surprising 
lack of accurate definition. I suppose it to be unques- 
tionable that the verb " learn " in a causative sense has 
had a widely extended and uninterrupted currency 
among English-speaking people for centuries. It is only 
the careful who consistently avoid it, and the careful 
are not the majority. Where one writer (as Tennyson) 
employs the construction with the English of an earlier 
day in mind, a thousand men, women, and children, of 
the masses, use it spontaneously, because with them it 
is the ordinary expression for the thought in mind. To 
call it either an " archaism " or a " survival " under such 
circumstances is to use language altogether too loosely 
for the purposes of philological investigation. May we 
not confine the term " archaism " to expressions not 
handed down in usage from age to age, but obtained

directly from an older time across an expanse of gener- 
ations to which the usage was not known? and is not a 
" survival," strictly speaking, an expression which has 
been handed down from generation to generation in 
spontaneous usage, but within such narrow limits as to 
have escaped general attention and acceptance? If I 
am wrong in this restriction of the terms, I am willing 
to be corrected; but if there be not some such restric- 
tion they should be dropped from the vocabulary of 
philology as of no scientific value. W H J

MORE IJIGHT ON EARLY NORTHWESTERN 
HISTORY.* 

In the Henry and Thompson Journals, Dr. 
Coues has found another rich store of materials 
such as he loves to handle. It is material, too, 
that he is admirably qualified to handle. No 
reader who has looked intelligently into the 
Doctor's splendid editions of what he calls on 
his present title-page " Lewis and Clark " and 
" Pike " can doubt his perfect competency to 
edit any mass of material relating to early 
Northwestern affairs that, for its elucidation, 
demands an extensive knowledge of geography, 
ethnography, natural history, and of earlier or 
contemporary exploration and adventure in the 
same region. Lewis and Clark ascended the 
Missouri River to its headwaters, crossed the 
continental Divide, and then descended by the 
Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, in the years 
1804-05. Pike, in 1805-06, ascended far to- 
wards the sources of the Mississippi, and in 
1806-07 penetrated the region southwest of 
the Missouri, until he found himself in Spanish 
territory and fell into the hands of the officers 
of Spain, who carried him away a prisoner into 
Mexico, but soon set him at liberty and per- 
mitted him to return to the United States. 
The Henry and Thompson explorations and 
adventures were in the regions of the Red 
River of the North, the Saskatchawan, the 
Missouri, and the Columbia. The experiences 
of all these explorers and adventurers, with 
many points of divergence, agree in their grand 
features : they all extend deeply into new 
regions, and lay open to the world new ter- 
ritories previously known only to aboriginal 
man. It will be seen, also, that the " Henry 
and Thompson" to a degree overlaps the 
" Lewis and Clark " territorially. The four 
men whose names figure in these titles were 
on the Missouri near the same time, and 
also on the Columbia. To a great degree 
Dr. Coues's studies of Lewis and Clark fitted 
him directly for his present work on Henry and 
Thompson. 

The amount of exact and detailed information

that the editor has brought to the elucidation 
of these Journals will not surprise those persons 
who are familiar with the " Lewis and Clark " 
and the " Pike." It suffices to say that the 
same patience, the same unwearied research, the 
same conscientious thoroughness, that marked 
the earlier works mark the present one as well. 
Dr. Coues states in his preface that when he 
had completed his researches he found himself 
" in the possession of some 4,500 memorandum 
cards, alphabetically arranged by subjects, and 
collectively constituting a sort of private cyclo- 
pedia of information concerning the Northwest 
Company, the X. Y. Company, the fur-trade of 
those days, the bourgeoise, their voyageurs and 
other engages, their Indian customers, their 
trading posts, their canoe routes and what 
not. in the way of biography, geography, eth- 
nography, and natural history." This vast 
amount of material is arranged in foot-notes to 
the text, and fills, if we may venture a hasty 
estimate, about a third of the total amount of 
space. The editor is so conscientious that he 
holds himself responsible for the antecedents 
and consequents of every person who is even 
named in the narrative. It is only rarely that 
we come upon a confession of inability to give 
some account of even the most obscure person. 
Indeed, some, if not much, of the information 
that is presented in these notes can never be 
of the slightest value to anybody, save to those 
specialists who may have occasion to go over 
the ground with a microscope. But these spe- 
cialists, we must remember, are the men for 
whom Dr. Coues is writing. The work can 
never greatly interest the mere general reader. 
This is not because it does not contain much 
interesting matter, but because it is too minute, 
too much loaded down with unimportant things, 
and is wholly wanting in attractiveness of style. 
Still, for what it purports to be, and what it is, 
the work has great value. It is a modest state- 
ment to say, as the editor does on his title-page, 
that it sheds new light on the early history of 
the Greater Northwest. 

Hitherto it has been easy to follow the steps 
of the explorers, traders, missionaries, and sol- 
diers, who first penetrated the country lying 
between the Lower Lakes and the Ohio River 
and the head of Lake Superior and the Mis- 
sissippi, and let in the light of day ; nor has it 
been difficult to follow the main lines of dis- 
covery and adventure that led from the Upper 
Lakes and the Mississippi to the Missouri, the 
Rocky Mountains, and beyond the mountains 
to the Western ocean. But it has been diffi- 



1897.]

cult to get other than general ideas of the con- 
temporaneous explorations, travels, and adven- 
tures by which the vast region beyond Lake 
Superior, west and northwest, was laid open to 
the knowledge of men. Even now, it is not 
easy for well-read men, at least south of the 
international boundary line, to grasp the fact 
that discovery at the North kept even pace 
with discovery at the South, and in some cases 
led the advance. Civilized men crossed the 
continent from Canada before they crossed it 
from the United States. In 1789 Mackenzie, 
starting from Lake Athabasca, followed the 
great river that bears his name to the frozen 
ocean ; and four years later, having crossed the 
Divide beyond the sources of Peace River, wrote 
in vermillion on a cliff overlooking the Pacific : 
" Alexander Mackenzie from Canada by 
land the twenty-second day of July one 
thousand seven hundred and ninety- three." 
But it was not until twelve years later that 
Lewis and Clark, having disentangled them- 
selves from the mazes of the Rocky Mountains, 
made their way by the Columbia to the ocean ; 
and it was not until thirty-nine years later, 
1832, that Schoolcraft discovered Lake Itasca. 
These remarks prepare the way for a proper 
appreciation of the Henry and Thompson Jour- 
nals. These writings will assist materially in pro- 
moting a fuller knowledge of the history of the 
Greater Northwest. 

The Editor's Preface, while comparatively 
brief, tells us plainly who Henry and Thomp- 
son were, gives a history of their journals, 
with their present location, and explains the 
methods that the editor has employed in pre- 
paring the material for the press. Henry was 
one of the proprietors of the Northwest Com- 
pany, and a trader. He is sometimes known 
as Alexander Henry the Younger, and was 
the nephew of the Elder of the same name 
who is associated with the famous massacre at 
Mackinaw. Thompson, the editor explains, 
" was a celebrated astronomer, geographer, ex- 
plorer, and discoverer in a word, the scien- 
tist, first of the Hudson Bay Company, then, 
during the whole period covered by Henry, of 
the Northwest Company, and later still of the 
International Boundary Commission, which ran 
the line between the British Possessions and 
the United States." Henry alone furnishes the 
text ; Thompson goes into the foot-notes along 
with the editor himself. 

Mention of the preface suggests the serious 
criticism that we have to make on Dr. Coues's 
editing. This is that he should not have prefixed 



to his work an introduction giving a rapid gen- 
eral account of the progress of discovery in the 
Greater Northwest from the very first down to 
1799, or at least have given a view of the exist- 
ing state of affairs at the time when Henry 
comes upon the scene. It is true that much of 
this information will be found in the notes, but 
in a scattered form. Such an account or view 
would have been of much assistance to nearly 
every reader who will turn these pages. 

Part III., " The Columbia," brings us upon 
the headwaters of some interesting American 
history. David Thompson, we are told, was 
not only the discoverer of the Saskatchawan 
and Athabascan passes over the Continental 
Divide, and of the sources of the Columbia 
River and all the country of its headwaters and 
upper tributaries, but he was the first white 
man who ever descended the great river to the 
confluence of Lewis's Fork or Snake River. 
On arriving at this point, Thompson took 
formal possession of the whole region in the 
name of the British Crown. Dr. Coues quotes 
the following memorandum from Thompson's 
Journal : 

" July 9, Tuesday, [1811]. . . \ a mile to the Junc- 
tion of the Shawpatin [Snake] River with this the 
Columbia, here I erected a small Pole, with a half 
Sheet of Paper well tied about it, with these words on 
it Know hereby that this country is claimed by Great 
Britain as part of its territories, and that the N. W. 
Company of Merchants from Canada, finding the fac- 
tory for this people inconvenient for them, do hereby 
intend to erect a Factory in this Place for the Com- 
merce of the Country around. D. Thompson." 

Another interesting f actis that Henry arrived 
at Astoria about a month before it was trans- 
ferred, along with John Jacob Astor's other 
property, to British hands. This is Henry's 
formal account of the transaction : 

" Dec. 13th. [1813]. The Dolly had anchored oppo- 
site the fort; before daybreak we got the powder on 
shore, and at 8 a. m. saluted the captain with seven 
guns. Mr. Verdier, midshipman, four marines, and 
three seamen from the Raccoon, came ashore, having 
hauled the Dolly near the wharf. At 3 p. m. we fired 
three guns as a signal to the Racoon, and then hoisted 
the Union Jack given us by the Captain. We collected 
all our men, armed with muskets; the marines were 
drawn up in uniform under arms, and the sailors with 
Quartermaster Hill attended to the guns. The captain, 
in full uniform, broke a bottle of Madeira on the flag- 
staff, and took possession of this country and place in, 
the name of His Britanic Majesty, calling this post Fort 
George. Three cheers were given by us all, and three 
rounds of musketry were then fired by our men and the 
marines. One of the latter had a narrow escape from 
shooting himself in the face, his gun having flashed and 
then gone off on being grounded. Eleven guns were 
fired from our four-pounder. We drank His Majesty's 
health, and a speech to Comcomly's son [was made by

Henry was not a traveller or an explorer 
properly so-called, but a business man intent 
on gain. He had a keen eye for the savage 
humanity that he saw around him, and does 
not mince his words when describing the miser- 
able beings that they were. Their drunken- 
ness, filth, thievery, murders, licentiousness, 
and superstitions are told in the most realistic 
fashion. Still, justice is done to such good 
qualities as the Indians had. Such a passage 
as the following, showing to what an acuteness 
the human senses may be cultivated, should 
delight the souls of some of our sense-realistic 
educators. 

" We had not gone far from the house before we fell 
upon the fresh tracks of some red deer, and soon after 
discovered the herd in a thicket of willows and poplars ; 
we both fired, and the deer disappeared in different 
directions. We pursued them, but to no purpose, as 
the country was unfavorable. We then returned to the 
spot where we had fired, as the Indian suspected that 
we had wounded some of them. We searched to see 
if we could find any blood; on my part I could find 
tracks, but no blood. The Indian soon called out, and 
I went to him, but could see no blood, nor any sign that 
an animal had been wounded. However, he pointed out 
the track of a large buck among the many others, and 
told me that from the manner in which this buck had 
started off, he was certain the animal had been wounded. 
As the ground was beaten in every direction by animals, 
it was only after a tedious search that he found where 
the buck had struck off. But no blood was seen until, 
passing through a thicket of willows, he observed a drop 
upon a leaf, and next a little more. He then began to 
examine more strictly, to find out in what part of the 
body the animal had been wounded; and judging by 
the height and other signs, he told me that the wound 
must have been somewhere between the shoulder and 
neck. We advanced about a mile, but saw nothing of 
the deer, and no more blood. I was for giving up the 
chase; but he assured me the wound was mortal, and 
that if the animal should lie down he could not rise 
again. We proceeded two miles further, when, coming 
out upon a small open space, he told me the animal was 
at no great distance, and very probably in this meadow. 
We accordingly advanced a few yards, and there we 
could see the deer lying at the last gasp. The wound 
was exactly as I had been told. The sagacity of the 
Saulteurs in tracing strong wood animals is astonishing. 
I have frequently witnessed occurrences of this nature; 
the bend of a leaf or blade of grass is enough to show 
the hunter the direction the game has taken. Their 
ability is of equally great service to war-parties, when 
they discover the footsteps of their enemies." 

Two good maps are found in the pocket.

section maps introduced into the body of the

reader. The carefully prepared Index fills a 
hundred double-column pages. The " Henry

in the same admirable style as the " Lewis and

THE SECRET OF THE EAST.* 

There is now on many a bookshelf a certain 
lot of tattered, may be, and well-thumbed books 
of various appearance which is gradually being 
replaced by the more respectable and appro- 
priate set, mulberry-covered and already begin- 
ning to be well-known. They did good work, 
the old ones, some of them paper-covered, 
" Plain Tales from the Hills " in a roughly- 
printed "Library," and "The Light that 
Failed " No. 1 in the Heinemann and Bales- 
tier collection ; some of them in American 
editions, the two Jungle Books or " The Seven 
Seas "; perhaps some stray Indian Railway edi- 
tion, " Under the Deodars " or " Wee Willie 
Winkie," or Thacker, Spink & Co.'s " Depart- 
mental Ditties "; a motley lot, not much to 
look at, doubtless, but still a noteworthy set of 
books. 

It seems a little ungrateful to replace them, 
but the new ones are certainly very pleasing. 
Paper and print, of course, of the best ; other 
things interesting, too, the binding of the color 
of an old Bokhara rug, the little white medal- 
lions on the side with the elephant's head and 
the lotus flowers, the curious pottery-pictures of 
Mr. Lockwood Kipling, and here and there the 
added preface of the author. 

The first reading of the old books and the 
re-reading of the new ones are two different 
things. At first there was a sort of enchanting 
novelty ; each story as it came was something 
new, and one read it without bother of criticism 
or definition. Rudyard Kipling is now a per- 
fectly well-known element in literature, but 
even now not easily criticised or defined for all 
that. 

Nor are the " Plain Tales from the Hills " an 
obvious help in the definition. What might 
be their impression could we read them now,

knowing nothing of the others, is hard to say ; 
as it is, reading them with the others in mind, 
we take their most obvious quality to be smart- 
ness a careless, carefully-concealed knowing- 
ness, that is well acquainted with the great 
things of the world as well as the little, and 
which can therefore tell each story " as it hap- 
pened " with a clear appreciation of the signifi- 
cance of it all, whatever it be, and often with a 
sort of pity for those less well informed. Some- 
times, in " Lispeth " or " Tod's Amendment," 
it is a story of that native life of which the 
English in India are so complacently ignorant ; 
sometimes, in " Thrown Away," " Bitters 
Neat," " Consequences," " Kidnapped," " A 
Bank Fraud," it is one of those strange things 
of life in general which people pass over with 
a stare, perhaps, because only an inner ring 
know the facts at bottom ; now and then, " His 
Chance in Life," " The Other Man," "In Error," 
" On the Strength of a Likeness," it is one of 
those unexplained ironies where no one really 
knows why it should not have been otherwise ; 
once or twice, " By Word of Mouth," " The 
Bisara of Pooree," it is a frankly mysterious 
matter that one might as well acknowledge 
without attempt at explanation. And all this 
strange secrecy with which Nature veils its 
matters of true import is imitated in various 
absurd satiric grotesques, in which the con- 
cealed irony is nothing more than the exploita- 
tion of a germ-destroyer or the consummating 
of an engagement, while the secretive and 
avenging Nature appears in the guise of Lieu- 
tenant Hogan-Yale or the unscrupulous owner 
of Lady Regula Baddun. 

All these matters are detailed with a simple 
directness, a complacent sententiousness, and 
an affectation of epigram which is wholly in 
keeping. Generally a snatch of simple-hearted 
cynicism ; generally a shrug of the shoulders at 
the end ; never any exhibition of sympathy 
with human passion, or interest in any indi- 
vidual human heart. And yet in this collection 
of cross-purposes and tragedies and whimsical- 
ities and clever dodges, melting down for the 
time the curt superiority, the unperturbed ac- 
quaintance with the world, the impassive inter- 
est in the event, are some half a dozen stories 
of native life, " The Gate of the Hundred Sor- 
rows," " In the House of Suddhoo," " Beyond 
the Pale," " Muhammad Din," which show that 
there is real power in all this, although not 
always power that understands itself. 

Still, although " Plain Tales from the Hills " 
are not an exhibition of Mr. Kipling's full 



strength by any means, the book does much to 
give an insight into some of his later work. 
Whatever was mere smart knowingness passed 
away, or, more accurately, developed into a 
surer and truer feeling, the feeling that the real 
forces in life are not spread open to view, that 
the real thing is hidden from us, that the super- 
ficial is for fools ; that these hidden forces, the 
passions beneath the surface, which influence 
all men or many men, not one or two, are the 
matters of real fascination, the great but secret 
currents, which crop up here and there but are 
far more apt to work unseen ; that few men 
(and fewer women) know them, but that those 
who do are the worthy ones, soldiers, tramps, old 
beggars, outlaws, officers, or no matter what. 
If men can see beneath the surface they are 
men, and brothers. 

Such a feeling, at least, seems to be at the 
bottom of things, as we read the later volumes. 
Whence, otherwise, the greatness of Mulvaney, 
with the unfaltering melancholy under his deep 
brows, a modern Odysseus without the youthful 
buoyancy of the Greek ? Could Ortheris or 
Learoyd have been friends of R. K. had it 
not been for Mulvaney ? Yet being friends of 
Mulvaney they partook at times of his high- 
souled woes. They feel, although intuitively, 
subconsciously, not with the direct assurance of 
Mulvaney, that the world moves on in its own 
strange ways, not those mentioned in books. 
And those who see them clearly will smile, may 
be, at first, but after the first will rarely smile 
again, for on the whole, between four and twenty 
soldiers swimming the Irrawaddy to get into 
Lungtungpen, and one man shooting another 
for interference in family affairs, there is only 
a difference of circumstance ; the fact in each 
case is that the true springs of action are as 
usual unknown or ignored, and that people play 
merrily in cooled lava which they think is rock. 

So it is with other things. Native India has 
its charm, aside from color and romance, be- 
cause life has gone on unchangingly for twenty 
centuries, according to its own unwritten laws 
whereof few Europeans know or care. The 
jungle fascinates one, too, because its inhabi- 
tants, more clever than humankind, know the 
laws of the life whereof they are a part. So 
children, understanding nothing perhaps, take 
matters far more simply with an adequate recog- 
nition of the springs of their simple action. 
Decent conventional society is futile enough, but 
those who fall from it like " Love o' Women " 
and Mclntosh Jellaludin are more patent ex- 
amples than anyone else. Such is the charm 



44 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



of any life, where there is such an esprit du 
corps that important things may be taken for 
granted, whether it be the mess of a cavalry 
regiment, the guild of mendicants, or the scat- 
tered confraternity of those who go down to 
the sea in ships. Those who know and who 
else is worth bothering about ? are aware 
of the hidden powers of life and are thereby 
rendered grave. All the same, on the surface 
for men who know how to take it life is 
a hustling, breezy, invigorating affair. Take it 
all in the day's work, be your task to personate 
an Indian God or make friends with an ele- 
phant, take it easily as it comes, and you will 
feel the blood in your body ; and a man of 
sense won't ask for much more. And if he 
keep a stiff upper-lip, never show the white 
feather, and be always fair and square, no one 
need ask any more of him. 

Realising this, and discarding or disowning 
the futilities and ineptitudes of conventional 
goings and comings, one may observe the 
strange things " of Life and Death and men 
and women and Love and Fate," and take 
them at their worth. Hence the threescore tales 
of Soldiers Three," " Military Tales," In 
Black and White," " The Phantom Rickshaw." 
The feeling never takes direct form but it is 
never absent, in the rattling soldier-scrapes of 
Mulvaney, Ortheris, and Learoyd, in the charm 
and color of the native episodes, in the later 
wonders and wanderings here and there nar- 
rated by soldier, sailor, or traveller. 

There is always a story or an event or a 
something done, save in half a dozen like "The 
Amir's Homily," "The Children of the Zodiac," 
" One View of the Question," " The Enlighten- 
ments of Paget, M.P.," there is always the 
interest in life in action. And in these later 
volumes most of the futile charms of the " Plain 
Tales " are dropped ; the mannerisms of " other 
stories " and shrugging ending are mostly gone, 
while the naive cynicism and the grandstand 
fireworks have merged into the general point of 
view and a confidence in the general power of 
the idea. So we have the grateful directness 
and avoidance of immaterial delicacies of dic- 
tion. Told " through the voice of one, two, or 
more people," there are thousands of details, 
but they all have something to do with the 
matter, and we get the story and are satisfied 
with it as a story. Then when we think about 
it afterward, it seems as though there were 
something more to it. 

As to the real value of all this, it is some- 
thing which would require a fresh discussion. 



We think it a standpoint which enables the 
story-teller to find stories and to compel the 
hearer to listen to them. We think it one of 
the secrets of Mr. Kipling's hold on the reader. 
But we must be content with the suggestion, 
for there is no space here to develope it. 

And even such as it is, it does not account 
for Mr. Kipling's power of emotional phrasing, 
as we might call it, nor for his power as a poet, 
which is much the same thing thrown in a dif- 
ferent direction, nor for a certain discernment 
of general trends of emotion in this world. But 
these matters appear in the volumes now in 
hand, only here and there, and in a rather un- 
developed form, so they need not be commented 
upon at present. EDWARD E. HALE, JK. 



THE RUINED CITIES AND MONUMENTS 
OF YUCATAN.* 

The Field Columbian Museum wisely en- 
courages study and publication. The paper on 
the Monuments of Yucatan, now before us, is 
the eighth in its series of printed documents, 
although the first in the line of Anthropology. 
In the winter of 1894-5, Mr. Allison V. 
Armour invited certain scientific gentlemen to 
make a trip with him, in his yacht " Ituna," to 
Yucatan and Mexico. The three months were 
busily employed by all, and in this book Mr. 
Holmes presents some of the archaeological re- 
sults of the trip. 

Notwithstanding all that has been written 
about Yucatan's archeology, the greater part 
of the work still remains undone. No single 
locality has yet been completely investigated. 
Some have never been examined since John L. 
Stephens wrote, as carefully as they were by 
him. Chichen-Itza, thanks to Mr. Thompson, 
has been much studied and will no doubt finally 
be adequately described. Thorough investiga- 
tion in Yucatan is no child's-play. Conditions 
of climate, life, surroundings, render it difficult 
in the extreme. Each visitor to Yucatec ruins 
ought to make an exact and accurate statement 
of his observations ; thus little by little a mass 
of reliable data will be accumulated. 

Mr. Armour's party visited Mugeres, Can- 
cun, and Cozumel Islands, and the mainland 
sites El Meco and Tuloom in Eastern Yuca- 
tan ; they visited Progreso, Uxmal, Izamal, and

Chichen-Itza, in Middle North Yucatan. The 
time spent at these localities was far too short 
for systematic observation. Mr. Holmes pre- 
sents us several new ground-plans and some 
new descriptions. His book also contains many 
plates from photographic originals. This is all 
good. There are, however, two features in his 
work which deserve special mention and render 
it one of the most important contributions in 
this field. 

(a) From a reading of the literature and 
from his field work, Mr. Holmes has prepared 
a valuable comprehensive study of the archi- 
tectural details of Maya buildings ; this material 
classified suggests the line of architectural evo- 
lution. The figures in illustration of this study 
are of much importance. In figure 1, a series 
of outline drawings, showing examples of ter- 
races and pyramids, illustrates the range and 
variation of these structures ; the cut teaches 
more than a hundred descriptions and views 
would do. Once seen by the student, it renders 
such descriptions and views thereafter compre- 
hensible. The cut showing a series of ground- 
plans of Maya temples is equally helpful ; the 
plans are arrayed in order of complexity, be- 
ginning with the single room, with one simple 
doorway. Study of this cut alone will do more 
to orientate the student than anything before 
written. There is danger, however, that some 
readers will imagine that the series represents 
an evolution, which must always pursue the 
same line and ever pass through the same stages 
which is not, of course, true. 

(b) Notable are the panoramas. Few who 
have not been among the ruined cities of Yuca- 
tan and Central America can conceive the dif- 
ficulties that their study presents. Most of 
them are in forest or thicket. Often one may 
travel within a few rods of important structures 
without knowing of their existence. To secure 
a photograph of a single building it is necessary 
to employ a considerable force of men to clear 
away the vegetable growth that hides it. Fre- 
quently one building cannot be seen from a 
neighboring building, and it is difficult for the 
student to keep clear ideas of orientation. Of 
course, carefully made ground-plans give the 
relation in position of the different structures, 
but to most persons ground-plans mean little. 
Mr. Holmes presents ground-plans of Uxmal 
and Chichen-Itza ; but he does more. Opposite 
them he places panoramic views of the two 
places, as gained from an imaginary standpoint 
above. The gain in definiteness of conception 
is astonishing. Study of the ground-plan, 



indeed, gives the idea that certain buildings 
occupy certain positions with reference to each 
other. Study of the panorama gives the feeling 
that this was once really a place where men 
lived, and thought of the buildings as in use 
and hints of their purpose force themselves upon 
us. In these two features in the clear study 
of architectural details and in the panoramic 
views Mr. Holmes's book is preeminently 
helpful. FREDERICK STARR. 



STUDIES IN MEDIAEVAL, LITERATURE.* 

There are two ways of dealing with the his- 
tory of general literature. One of them is the 
long-practised method of treating a literature 
as a national product, and studying its devel- 
opment with but slight reference to the parallel 
development of its contemporaries, ignoring 
the fact that all the literatures of modern 
Europe are to a considerable extent spiritually 
cognate. The other is the comparative method, 
which has gained much ground of late, and 
which rests upon the fundamental assumption 
that the literature of one country may best be 
understood when we take into account the con- 
temporary literature of the others, and that 
the conception of a literary species held by one 
race may be brought most clearly into view 
when we study the development of that species 
under other conditions of race and historical 
environment. It is in this comparative spirit 
that the series of volumes entitled " Periods of 
European Literature " has recently been under- 
taken and entrusted to the general editorial 
direction of Professor George Saintsbury, who 
himself provides the volume which covers the 
literary product of the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries. For the series as a whole twelve 
volumes have been planned, and assigned to 
men of excellent authority in their respective 
fields. Professor W. P. Ker, for example, will 
write of " The Dark Ages," Mr. Edmund 
Gosse of " The Romantic Revolt " of the close 
of the eighteenth century, and Mr. Walter H. 
Pollock of "The Romantic Triumph" of the 
early nineteenth century. Such a programme 
as this arouses high anticipations, and the vol- 
ume first to appear (which is the second in the 
chronological order) invites a careful scrutiny.

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Mr. Saintsbury gives to the book which deals 
with his particular cross-section of the literary 
tree the title of " The Flourishing of Romance 
and the Rise of Allegory." In an editorial 
preface, he tells us at considerable length how 
particularly well he is qualified for his task. 
Lest his readers should still be in doubt, he 
afterwards recurs to this subject upon a number 
of occasions, telling us how much he has read, 
and how diligently he has devoted himself to 
the literature in question. This writing is 
mostly superfluous, for the test of a work is 
the way in which it is done, not the volubility 
with which the writer professes his competence, 
and, for the rest, the public knows tolerably 
well what are Mr. Saintsbury's achievements, 
what his limitations, and what his idiosyn- 
crasies. It knows, for example, that he is an 
enormous reader and has a retentive memory ; 
it knows also that his strength is in the depart- 
ments of English, French, and German litera- 
ture, while it expects from him only second- 
hand information concerning most of the other 
departments that come within the scope of his 
survey. It knows, moreover, that he frequently 
indulges in obiter dicta that are more plausible 
than convincing, and that he is capable of 
writing in a most exasperating style. 

After an introductory chapter upon " The 
Function of Latin " as a vehicle for the mes- 
sage of medieval thought, the author plunges 
into his subject proper, taking Bodel's familiar 
couplet for a text. 

" Ne sont que trois matte res k mil home attendant, 
De France et de Bretaigne et de Rome la grant." 

Each of these three " matters " forms the sub- 
ject of a separate chapter. Of the chansons 
de geste he writes at length and with an exag- 
gerated enthusiasm which calls for a few pages 
of M. Brunetiere as a corrective. He charac- 
terizes the chansons as " the half -million or 
million verses of majestic cadence written in 
one of the noblest languages, for at least first 
effect, to be found in the history of the world, 
possessing that character of distinction, of 
separate and unique peculiarity in matter and 
form, which has such extraordinary charm, and 
endowed besides, more perhaps than any other 
division, with the attraction of presenting an 
utterly vanished Past." In a later passage he 
writes of the fabliaux in almost equally impas- 
sioned strain, and again we must refer to 
M. Brunetiere for a saner sort of appreciation. 
In discussing "The Matter of Britain," the 
author shows reasonable familiarity with the 
latest efforts of scholarship to bring some sort 



of order out of the curious tangle of fact and 
surmise that surrounds the Arthurian tale, and 
makes a strong argument for the claim of 
Walter Map to be considered as chiefly respon- 
sible for the moulding of the Legend into the 
form which gave it a literary vitality so great 
and so enduring. Having discussed these sub- 
jects, and the " matter of Rome " (which deals 
chiefly with the tales of Troy and of Alexander), 
Mr. Saintsbury proceeds to the making of the 
English language and the settlement of its 
prosody. Here we come to the beginnings of 
English lyric, and the refrain, 

" Blow, northerne wynd, 
Send thou me my suetyng, 
Blow, northerne wynd, blou, blou, blou," 

is not inaptly described as " Tennysonian verse 
five hundred years before Tennyson." 

A chapter entitled " Middle High German 
Poetry," which is too brief to consist of much 
more than a series of phrases, is followed by a 
long disquisition upon " The 'Fox,' the 'Rose,' 
and the Minor Contributions of France." The 
following passage upon the literary predom- 
inance of twelfth and thirteenth-century France 
is strikingly put, but hardly overdrawn: 

" France, if not Paris, was in reality the eye and 
brain of Europe, the place of origin of almost every 
literary form, the place of finishing and polishing, even 
for those forms which she did not originate. She not 
merely taught, she wrought and wrought consum- 
mately. She revived and transformed the fable; per- 
fected, if she did not invent, the beast-epic; brought the 
short prose tale to an exquisite completeness; enlarged, 
suppled, chequered, the somewhat stiff and monotonous 
forms of Provencal lyric into myriad-noted variety; 
devised the prose-memoir, and left capital examples of 
it; made attempts at the prose history; ventured upon 
much and performed no little in the vernacular drama; 
besides the vast performance, sometimes inspired from 
elsewhere but never as literature copied, which we 
have already seen, in her fostering if not mothering of 
Romance." 

In still another passage, we are told more suc- 
cinctly : 

" It is the simplest truth to say that in the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries France kept the literary school 
of Europe, and that with the single exception of Iceland, 
during a part, and only a part, of the time, all the 
nations of Europe were content to do, each in its own 
tongue, and sometimes even in hers, the lessons which 
she taught, the exercises which she set them." 

The chapter which closes up the French section 
of the history is brought to an end by a few 
paragraphs upon Ruteboeuf, the chronicles of 
Villehardouin and Joinville, and the lovely tale 
of " Aucassin et Nicolete." 

The remainder of Mr. Saintsbury's work is 
devoted to chapters upon " Icelandic and Pro- 
ven9al " (thus curiously bracketed together) 



1897.]

and " The Literature of the Peninsulas." Here 
the author's knowledge is most evidently de- 
fective, and he gives us little more than a 
meagre compilation ; but he is hardly to be 
blamed for not having made all the provinces 
of mediaeval literature his own, and, when all 
is said, there are probably few men living who 
could have covered the two centuries as satis- 
factorily as he has done. And his style, in 
spite of its mannerisms, is always sprightly 
and attractive, lending interest to the dullest 
subjects, and carrying the reader on without 
much jolting from theme to theme. We shall 
be pleased indeed if Mr. Saintsbury's collab- 
orators contrive to make their several volumes 
as readable as we have found this one to be. 

Published almost simultaneously with the 
book just now under review, Professor W. P. 
Ker's " Epic and Romance," being a collection 
of essays on mediaeval literature, calls for con- 
sideration at the same time. As a collection of 
essays, rather than a continuous history, this 
book does not have the unity and the symmetry 
of Mr. Saintsbury's volume, yet it has far more 
of these qualities than might be supposed. In 
scope, it is somewhat broader, ranging from 
the earliest productions of Teutonic poetry all 
the way down to the finished and self-conscious 
art of Chaucer and Boccaccio. In the arrange- 
ment of its material, we find a twofold basis of 
classification. First, there is the division sug- 
gested by the title, and, throughout his treat- 
ment, the author keeps steadily in view the dis- 
tinction between the epic and the romantic 
forms. This distinction is set forth as follows : 

" Whatever Epic may mean, it implies some weight 
and solidity; Romance means nothing, if it does not 
convey some notion of mystery and fantasy. A general 
distinction of this kind, whatever names may be used to 
render it, can be shown, in mediaeval literature, to hold 
good of the two large groups of narrative belonging to 
the earlier and the later Middle Ages respectively. 
Beowulf might stand for the one side, Lancelot or 
Gawain for the other. It is a difference not confined 
to literature. The two groups are distinguished from 
one another, as the respectable piratical gentleman of 
the North Sea coast in the ninth or tenth century differs 
from one of the companions of St. Louis. The latter 
has something fantastic in his ideas which the other has 
not." 

The other division of the author's material 
causes it to be grouped (after the preliminaries 
are disposed of) under the three heads of Teu- 
tonic Epic, Icelandic Saga, and Old French 
Epic, and to each of these subjects a main sec- 
tion of the work is devoted. The first of them 
lies without the scope of Mr. Saintsbury's book, 
but the other two run parallel with it, and a 



comparison of the respective treatments is 
instructive. Mr. Saintsbury is at his best on 
the ground of French epic, and at his worst in 
the domain of Icelandic saga. Professor Ker, 
on the other hand, is distinctly at his best in 
dealing with the latter subject, and the inade- 
quacy of Mr. Saintsbury's treatment becomes 
very apparent when we compare it with this 
work of a real scholar in Icelandic. We know 
of no better treatment of the subject in English 
than may be found in -these chapters, and for 
them, even more than for the others, Professor 
Ker has earned our gratitude. No truer thing 
than the following was ever said of Icelandic 
literature : 

" Clear self-consciousness is the distinction of Ice- 
landic civilization and literature. It is not vanity or 
conceit. It does not make the Icelandic writers anx- 
ious about their own fame or merits. It is simply clear 
intelligence, applied under a dry light to subjects that 
in themselves are primitive, such as never before or 
since have been represented in the same way. The life 
is their own life; the record is that of a dispassionate 
observer." 

We might say many other things in praise of 
these essays upon mediaeval literature. They 
display, for one thing, a happy gift of tren- 
chant epigrammatic expression, as in this state- 
ment : " Ulysses quoting Aristotle is an anach- 
ronism ; but King Alfred's translation of 
Boethius is almost as much of a paradox." Or 
in this : " The comprehensiveness of the greater 
kinds of poetry, of Homer and Shakespeare, 
is a different thing from the premeditated and 
self-assertive realism of the authors who take 
viciously to common life by way of protest 
against the romantic extreme." As here ap- 
plied, " viciously " is a genuine critical epithet. 
We must find space, also, for praise of the 
author's fine characterization of a heroic age,

THE DIAL

FACT AND FICTION IN SOCIAL, STUDY.* 



Mr. H. de B. Gibbins, the author of a popular 
" Industrial History of England," has prepared an 
enlarged work with the same aim and outline, to 
which he gives the title " Industry in England." 
The purpose of the author was to relate a concise 
story of economic history which might serve as a 
preliminary sketch for those who wished to gain 
the essential elements of the subject or to proceed 
to more elaborate treatises. The materials are 
divided into five historical, periods, from the Nor- 
man Conquest to Modern England. In each period 
the industrial life is brought into the foreground. 
Political, military, and ecclesiastical changes are 
noted only as they affect or are affected by economic 
activities. The productive processes, exchange, 
methods of agriculture and stock-raising, internal 
and foreign traffic, markets, roads, division of labor, 
regulative institutions, guilds, corporations, and 
industrial laws, are among the chief topics discussed. 

The book is written in the spirit of Green, Rogers, 
Cunningham, and Ashley. The common daily life 
of the people is brought before us as in a drama, 
and is shown to have surpassing interest. As the 
author approaches the modern time, the materials 
become more abundant and the treatment more 
vivid and partisan. Sympathy for the workers is 
not concealed. It is the modern note throughout. 
Those who were once ignored by princes, historians, 
politicians, poets laureate, and ecclesiastics, are 
coming into recognition. Democracy not only insists 
upon the rights of the living but upon the rights of 
the dead. The proletarian is vindicating the per- 
sonal reputation of the poor. It is marvellous how 
much has been concealed, stowed away as insignifi- 
cant rubbish, barely alluded to in the effort to 
glorify the great. The emphasis falls now upon a 
different place. Such a book as the one under 
notice has more than antiquarian interest ; it reveals 
to us the master-thought of our own age while it 
describes the past. 

The maps, while few, are very valuable and 
instructive. The footnotes furnish a bibliography 
which directs to the best accessible sources and 
gives suggestive criticism of their contents and 
value. It would be a good book to put in the hands 
of a University Extension class during the progress 
of a course of lectures on the labor movement. It 
is more special than Green's " Short History," and 
brings up the discussion of such subjects as the 
manor, village, mark, and f uedal organization to our 
own day. The factory system, factory legislation,

the condition of the working classes, and agricul- 
tural depression, are carefully treated, and the 
account has great contemporary interest. 

If any reader can learn anything new from the 
work entitled " The Revolutionary Tendencies of 
the Age," his knowledge of economics and social 
history must be very limited. The inequalities of 
human life are described in somewhat florid style 
and with numerous dreamy allegories. Economic 
power is the goal of Democracy. Revolution is 
inevitable now that the people have come to their 
senses through universal education. If the horse 
were intelligent he would let no man ride him. But 
what will be the nature of the revolution? Not 
absolute Socialism. What then? It is not quite 
clear. But we needed no ghost to come from the 
abyss to tell us that riches give power and that 
poverty is exceedingly inconvenient. Perhaps this 
judgment should be tempered by the consideration 
that the author earnestly and forcefully urges the 
responsibility of the possessors of wealth, and places 
in very clear light the central aspiration of the 
working classes and their certain control of the 
future. He will not consider methods of violence, 
but hints at limitation of inheritance and other legal 
measures of redistribution of accumulated fortunes. 

The aim of the interesting little volume entitled 
" Genesis of the Social Conscience " is, as indicated 
in the sub-title, to show " the relation between the 
establishment of Christianity in Europe and the 
Social Question." The method is the exact opposite 
of that followed by Loria and Marx from the 
economic to the spiritual. With a fixed and an- 
nounced purpose, political and economic history "are 
passed coolly by." The germination and growth of 
a new valuation of the individual man are traced 
through the ages of Christian history. Christianity 
set an infinite price upon the soul. The idea of the 
one God involves the unity of the race, since all are 
equally made in the divine image. Personality 
implies freedom. The sense of sin reduced aristoc- 
racy to a level with the lowest ; " all equal are within 
the Church's gate." The notions of humanity, the 
Kingdom of God, duty, help to furnish " the Re- 
former's Conscience." Out of these beliefs are 
born the French Revolution, Democracy, universal 
suffrage, care for the " downmost man." 

The book is more than a tacit protest against the 
materialistic explanation of history. It takes life at 
a higher level than the phrase " Man is what he 
eats." It assumes that man cannot live by bread 
alone, and indicates the social power of forces which 
seem small and dim only because attention is not 
bestowed upon them. The pages glitter with bright 
sayings, and there are many attractive passages. 
The reader may find some difficulty in keeping the 
thread of the argument, because the author leaps 
back and forth, from Aquinas to Aristotle, from 
Augustine to Rousseau, with alarming agility. He 
himself says : " The vast bulk of events is untouched.

I shall seem to make ideas advance to the sound of 
the trumpet, like the things that happen in one of 
Dumas' novels." The absence of events gives at 
times a rather unearthly impression ; but the mod- 
ern instances quickly remind one that a thoroughly 
practical man is teaching him. Incidentally, we 
wonder what the author means by saying (p. 225), 
" Lincoln's Gettysburg address, without the name 
of God in it, is religious to the core." Which text, 
of the three extant, did he have before him? 

Mr. Bellamy's new book, " Equality," is written 
in a style that may seem to many tedious. To one 
acquainted with Socialistic literature, there is noth- 
ing in its principles that is new. The book is a 
re-statement of ideas already made familiar by 
Marx, Lassalle, Proudhom, Fourier, " Merrie En- 
gland," and all the rest. But for all that, we must 
not ignore the message it bears. One-sided it is ; 
often unjust and exaggerated ; concealing the good 
of an age and minifying the difficulties of Socialism ; 
but honest, searching, earnest, all must concede it 
to be. The sins of our day are unsparingly exposed 
to view ; modern instances illustrate many pages ; 
the wrongs and cruelties that make the conscience 
of all good cities gnaw at the heart are graphically 
set forth. 

The story of the book is soon told : two lovers 
talk economics, the Socialist always coming off with 
easy victory because the capitalist advocate had 
already given up his cause. This is kept up through 
four hundred pages. It will not pay to buy the book 
for its dramatic interest. 

The gallery of pictures of " Looking Backward " 
is here somewhat enlarged. Marx never tried to 
tell what a socialistic society would be like. Even 
Bebel's " Die Frau " carefully kept out of the proph- 
ecy business. Kantzby's " Erfurt Program " dis- 
tinctly asserts that a Socialist ought not to try to 
depict the future state of the terrestrial New Jeru- 
salem. The weather prophets, dealing in their high 
towers with relatively simple elements, do not fore- 
tell the meteoric changes of the next week, and they 
are in luck if they are right for forty hours in ad- 
vance. But here is a prophet who makes a pano- 
rama of a city which is not yet to exist for a century. 
It looks like courage. 

The fundamental doctrine of " Equality " is Com- 
munism. 

" The corner-stone of our state is economic equality. 
. . . What is life without its material basis, and what 
is an equal right to life but a right to an equal material 
basis for it ? What is liberty ? How can men be free 
who must ask the right to labor and to live from their 
fellow-men and seek their bread from the hands of 
others ? How else can any government guarantee lib- 
erty to men save by providing them a means of labor 
and of life coupled with independence ? . . . What 
form of happiness, so far as it depends at all on material 
facts, is not bound up with economic conditions ? " 

The Declaration of Independence, therefore, logic- 
ally leads to Socialism of a communistic type. Lib- 



erty and happiness are impossible without a secure 
income. 

The imaginative writer of " Equality " distributes 
promises of a salary of $4000 a year to all citizens 
with a lavish hand. Why that particular sum was 
fixed, and out of what annual national income it is 
to be paid, are questions which are easily waved 
aside. The poet is under no such vulgar obligations 
as a statistician or an economist. And in judging 
the book we must steadily remember that we are 
reading a poet, like the author of Utopia, and not a 
serious work on economics. 

All through the book there seems a protest against 
the law of competition, as being cruel and unjust, 
as immoral. But the author usually fails to see 
that it is a simple wnmoral force, which can be used 
for good or evil according to human intelligence, 
character, and social organization. He does catch 
a glimpse of the idea that this blind energy, like 
gravity and lightning, may be harnessed and driven 
when he writes (p. 38) about " ranking," by which 
he means " the figure which indicates his previous 
standing in the schools and during his service as an 
unclassified worker, and is supposed to give the 
best attainable criterion thus far of his relative in- 
telligence, efficiency, and devotion to duty. When 
there are more volunteers for particular occupations 
than there is room for, the lowest in ranking have 
to be content with a second or third preference." 
The horns of the beast of competition are tipped 
with gold and the tail is decorated with ribbons, 
but they are there, even in the Communistic Heaven. 

The address (p. 99) to the Masters of the Bread 
is a very incisive piece of irony. It is an appeal 
to capitalists for permission to be their slaves for a 
morsel of bread. 

" O Lords of the Bread [say the laborers], feel our 
thews and sinews, our arms and our legs; see how strong 
we are. Take us and use us. ... Let us freeze and 
starve in the forecastles of your ships. . . . Do what 
you will with us, but let us serve you, that we may eat 
and not die." 

The professional men, college professors, editors, 
and lawyers, cringe before the same potentates : 

" O Masters of the Bread, take us to be your servant. 
. . . Give us to eat, and we will betray the people to 
you, for we must live. We will plead for you in the 
courts against the widow and the fatherless. We will 
speak and write in your praise, and with cunning words 
confound those who speak against you and your power 
and State." 
The preachers also beg of the capitalists : 

"We must have bread to eat like others. ... In 
the name of God the Father will we forbid them to claim 
the rights of brothers, and in the name of the Prince of 
Peace will we preach your law of competition." 

The cry of the women and the children is almost 
too pathetic and suggestive to repeat. And there 
is only too much truth in the picture. 

When we come to look closely at the facts, how- 
ever, things are not so bad or so dark. Not all 
great publishing-houses, for example, are dominated

by heartless Capitalism, for on the title-page of this 
vigorous plea for Socialism stands the name of the 
great house of D. Appleton & Co. The contrast 
starts a smile, and emphasizes the promise that the 
Revolution is to he bloodless. 

The treatment of the question of police and mil- 
itary force (p. 318) deserves study on the part of 
all who desire to know what wage-workers almost 
universally feel in the cities of this country. They 
regard the National Guard simply as a Capitalist 
Guard. 

"In 1892 the militia of five States, aided by the 
regulars, were under arms against strikers simultan- 
eously, the aggregate force of troops probably making 
a larger body than General Washington ever com- 
manded. Here surely was civil war already. . . . To 
this pass the industrial system of the United States was 
fast coming it was becoming a government of bay- 
onets." 

This state of things is rightly regarded as full of 
peril. 

The morality of family inheritance is absolutely 
denied, but general social inheritance is not ques- 
tioned. According to the author, the people of a 
county or state or nation may hold as their own 
goods which their ancestors toiled for, but the 
immediate children of the particular persons who 
earned this property have no claim as members of 
the family. This discrepancy seems to have escaped 
the attention of the author. He says : 

" While the moralists and the clergy solemnly justified 
the inequalities of wealth and reproved the discontent 
of the poor on the ground that those inequalities were 
justified by natural differences in ability and diligence, 
they knew all the time, and everybody knew who 
listened to them, that the foundation principle of the 
whole property system was not ability, effort, or de- 
sert of any kind whatever, but merely the accident of 
birth, than which no possible claim could more com- 
pletely mock at ethics." 

When the Revolution comes, capitalists will not be 
reimbursed for their losses; they will be glad 
enough to escape punishment for their former 
oppressions. 

The book entitled " Woman and the Republic," 
by Helen Kendrick Johnson, is calculated to make 
summer weather in some quarters pass rapidly from 
warm to hot. A man who has for many years advo- 
cated woman suffrage almost feels the courage ooze 
out of him when he reads this woman's book accus- 
ing the universal-suffrage movement of being un- 
just, undemocratic, and all that is evil. To what 
are we coming? Chivalry is at a discount; the 
desire to be fair is not appreciated. But these 
vigorous chapters will provoke discussion. One can 
already hear the champions of " equal franchise " 
cutting the rods with which to chasten this "slave" 
who dares defend her oppressor, the tyrant man. 
Just imagine a woman, one who has studied history 
and law books, retailing such rank heresy and trea- 
son as this book contains. "The movement to 
obtain the elective franchise for woman is not in 



harmony with those through which woman and gov- 
ernment have made progress." The universal suf- 
frage has not helped, but has hindered, the anti- 
slavery movement, missions, charities, the war for 
the Union, the opening of trades and professions to 
women. Woman suffrage is at war with democratic 
principles, and is allied with monarchy, aristocracy, 
and ecclesiastical oppression. The author subjects 
to criticism the claim that woman suffrage can rest 
on the maxims " Taxation without representation is 
tyranny " and "There is no just government with- 
out the consent of the governed." The laws relating 
to property, it is claimed, have been improved by 
men far more rapidly than if women had votes. 
The influence of women on political life is great 
because it is non-partisan. The Suffrage Woman's 
Bible is declared to be so poorly edited that the 
women who gave it to the world have no claim to a 
respectful hearing on educational subjects. In rela- 
tion to religious preaching, it is said : " While the 
possibilities of her nature tend to make her supreme 
in capacity to point the way to higher regions, it 
also contains qualities that may render her pecu- 
liarly dangerous as a public leader." 

The disabilities of sex are such that women can- 
not perform the duties of a voting citizen, and there- 
fore ought not to be clothed with power to get the 
country into trouble when force is required to de- 
fend it. " To attempt to put it [the ballot] into the 
hands of those who are not physically fitted to main- 
tain the obligations that may result from any vote 
or any legislative act, is to render law a farce, and 
to betray the trust imposed upon them by the con- 
stitution they have sworn to uphold." The privi- 
leges of a voting citizen imply police, jury, and 
military duty, and it is not enough to " distribute 
tracts and hold conventions." 

In relation to the Home, the author believes that 
" the Suffrage movement strikes a blow squarely at 
the home and the marriage relation." And, to sum 
up all : 

" The greatest danger with which this land is threat- 
ened comes from the ignorant and persistent zeal of 
some of its women. They abuse the freedom under 
which they live, and to gain an impossible power would 
fain destroy the Government that alone can protect 
them. The majority of women have no sympathy with 
this movement; and in their enlightenment, and in the 
consistent wisdom of our men, lies our hope of defeating 
this unpatriotic, unintelligent, and unjustifiable assault 
upon the integrity of the American Republic."

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Cicero and 
his friends. 



One is not surprised to see the name 
of a new translator on the title-page 
of " Cicero and His Friends," the 
third volume of Boissier's works, which the Putnams 
have put forth in English dress, and the change 
proves on examination to be a decided improve- 
ment. We find none of the glaring blunders in 
classical names, references to classical literature, 
Latin quotations, etc., which marred the other two 
volumes, and the thought of the original seems to 
have been reproduced with a fair degree of accuracy 
as a general thing. To the latter point, however, 
some surprising exceptions will be noticed, as the 
reversal of the sense of a passage on page 328 by 
the reproduction of a double negative, and the 
weak " all that he wills he means," page 309, for 
" tout ce qu'il veut, il le veut bien." Perhaps it is 
too much to ask a translator to correct inaccuracies 
in his original, but one who takes up such a work 
as this for translation ought to know the twenty- 
first book of Livy well enough not to let omnibus 
take the place of omnis in the words " Qucestus 
omnis patribus indecorus visus" The faults of 
this translation are irritating to the reader because 
they are faults which might easily have been re- 
moved had the translator (Adnah David Jones^ 
taken a little time for revision. A sentence here 
and there shows that he can place the word " only " 
in a fitting position, but we have counted more than 
fifty passages in which he has failed to do so. He 
splits infinitives with the barbarous glee of an 
Indian splitting skulls, and does not care enough 
for accuracy of expression even to avoid such 
bungling as " Cicero was perhaps more indebted for 
this union ... to Catiline rather than to himself." 
And yet the reader will find that the charm of 
Boissier rises above all these infelicities, and makes 
the book well worth the time necessary for its 
reading. 

The "Famous Scots Series" (im- 
tn fi Sco P t r hLts. Parted by Scribner) has pretty well 

established its reputation by this 
time, so that we have now a good idea as to what 
to expect of new volumes. The last two to reach us 
that on Smollett, by Mr. Oliphant Smeaton, and 
that on Boswell, by Mr. Keith Leask are as good 
as the volumes already published. Mr. Smeaton 
gives a brisk hearty account of the great novelist, 
in a good broad style, and succeeds in keeping the 
sympathy of the reader with his rather difficult sub- 
ject. We are a little puzzled at his thinking that 
Smollett died in his fifty-second year, when he has 
given the dates of his birth and death as 17211771, 
and also at his saying that Thackeray achieved with 
rare effect " the evolution of character through the 
medium of letters." Probably, however, there are 
letters in some of Thackeray's novels, and certainly 
a year more or less in a man's age is a minor matter. 
As for Boswell, Mr. Leask rescues him from the pil- 



lory of Macaulay only to gibbet him anew. His con- 
ception of Boswell, more complete and accurate than 
Macaulay's, differs from it chiefly, we are inclined 
to think, as 1831 differs from 1897. The present 
Boswell is nearly as contemptible as Macaulay's ; he 
seems more natural to us, because some of his traits 
an exaggerated sensibility and versatility and an 
exaggerated self-importance are rather common 
to-day. Boswell seems also to have been quite 
lacking in principle and in power, so that we under- 
stand his being able to write Johnson's life no better 
after we have read his own. Both Smollett and 
Boswell are men worth writing of. But in a series 
of Famous Scots they are in curiously incongruous 
company. Taking them all in all, they were, we 
suppose, as lacking in Scotch characteristics as any 
Scots one would readily think of. 



English politic* and subject of English politics of 
the development of eight hundred years ago is not of 
the national spirit. itgel ver y interesting, yet when set 
forth to show the development of national character, 
and the danger of permanent deterioration that was 
then escaped, it takes on both interest and value. 
Professor O. H. Richardson has rewritten the his- 
tory of the middle portion of the thirteenth century 
in his monograph, " The National Movement in the 
Reign of Henry III. and its Culmination in the 
Barons' War " (Macmillan), in such a way as to 
present clearly, first, the denationalization of En- 
gland under the exactions and aggressions of the 
papacy, the swarm of foreign favorites, and the 
weak wilf ullness of the King ; then the reaction of 
these upon the national spirit in church and people, 
resulting in the rise of a strong national spirit and 
the firm establishment of the fundamental rights of 
the people. It is a thoroughly creditable piece of 
work, based on an independent study of the sources, 
yet steadied by the work of the master in this field, 
Bishop Stubbs. It is not without a spice of hero- 
worship in the sympathetic account of the great 
earl Simon, yet this is not so strong as to vitiate the 
work, while adding zest to it. It is interesting to 
note that the publication of the book is followed 
immediately by the election of its author to a pro- 
fessorship at Yale. 

From the press of Edward Arnold 
comes " The Beggars of Paris," 
written by Louis Paulian. Lady 
Herschell's name is on the outside, but she is merely 
the translator. The author turned beggar and ex- 
plored Paris. He lived by begging, and beat his 
way with delightful success. He discovered that 
begging is a lucrative profession which thrives on 
thoughtless almsgiving. One stands by a wall, rubs 
his eyes till they smart, and collects twice the wages 
of a mechanic simply by holding out his dirty cap. 
All the tricks of the trade are here exposed in de- 
tail, and the story is enlivened by anecdote. The 
records of the Bureau of Associated Charities, or 
of the Relief and Aid Society, would furnish par- 



Segging as 
a fine art.

allels for nearly every type. The social need is a 
radical treatment of the whole class ; an offer of 
work to the able-hodied, prompt arrest of every 
beggar, humane hiding from publicity in suitable 
almshouses of those whose infirmities and friendless 
condition make it impossible for them to be self- 
supporting. This lesson applies to America as well 
as to France. The story is so interesting that it is 
a good book for charity workers to circulate. 

Professor Giddings of Columbia has 
rendered no small service in prepar- 
ing, under the title " Theory of So- 
cialization" (Macmillan), a syllabus of his larger 
work on "The Principles of Sociology," already 
noticed in THE DIAL. It is a great advantage to 
have the argument outlined by the author himself, 
apart from the vast mass of material by which he 
illustrates and establishes his vital ideas. The sylla- 
bus is enriched with some new examples, and cer- 
tain propositions about appreciation, utilization, and 
characterization appear here for the first time. The 
definition of his famous phrase, " consciousness of 
kind," as now given is, " the state of consciousness 
in which a perception of resemblance, sympathy, 
and liking, and a desire for recognition, are com- 
bined." The statement of the modes of equality 
(p. 35) is very suggestive, and helps to give defi- 
niteness to a word which expresses the aspirations 
of the democracy, but is misleading and hurtful 
unless it is explained and its limits accurately and 
rationally bounded. 

The volume entitled "Thackeray's 
Haunts and Homes" ( Scribner ) 
allures in the first place by its title, 
and in the second place by the beauty of the illus- 
trations, which occupy the larger part of the space 
in the volume. The illustrator is also the author, 
and was Thackeray's personal friend, Eyre Crowe, 
A.R.A. His book consists of a sheaf of sketches 
made for the sake of preserving the outward look of 
Thackeray's habitations before the inevitable house- 
wrecker shall sweep away these literary vestiges. 
The text follows, in approximate chronological se- 
quence, the connecting links in the chain of events 
which led to the various changes of Thackeray's 
surroundings. The book is welcome both for its 
artistic and biographic value, since it brings one 
quite near to the immortal Thackeray " in his habit 
as he lived."

The questions involved in a discus- 
sion of the life of Jesus while on

Professor Mason delivered five lectures on this 
theme before the General Seminary in New York 
in 1896, on the Bishop Paddock foundation, and 
they are now published in book form by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co. Though somewhat over- 
grown with verbiage, the lectures reveal a careful 
study of the Gospels and of the literature of the topic.

While the book is modern in construction it is 
ancient in position, and adds next to nothing to our 
weapons of warfare. 

Count Lyof N. Tolstoi has crowned 
his literary works with one which, 
though a condensation of a larger 
work, should be entitled " My Gospel in Brief." 
It is a fusion of the four New Testament gospels 
into one, but into the one that the author conceives 
to be the true one. He omits " all passages relating 
to the life of John the Baptist, Christ's birth and 
genealogy, his miracles, his resurrection, and the 
references to prophesies fulfilled in his life." With 
these expunged, Christ's teaching is, according to 
Count Tolstoi, the most conventional presentment 
of metaphysics and morals, the purest and most 
complete doctrine of life, and the highest light 
which the human mind has ever reached. (Pub- 
lished by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.) 



LITERARY NOTES. 



The third of Mr. G. P. Humphrey's " American 
Colonial Tracts " is a reprint of " A State of the 
Province of Georgia, Attested upon Oath, in the Court 
of Savannah, November 10, 1740." The date of the 
original is 1742. 

The most northern paper in the world is printed at 
Godthaab, in Greenland, and is called " Lsesestof ." It 
is a missionary sheet, made for the Eskimos, and has 
been the means of teaching many of them to read the 
Danish language. 

The New Amsterdam Book Co. announce for imme- 
diate publication " Women Novelists of Queen Victoria's 
Reign," and a new revised edition of " Lady Hamilton 
and Lord Nelson," an historical biography by Mr. John 
Cordy Jeaffreson. 

Daniel Greenleaf Thompson, of New York, the 
author of " The Philosophy of Fiction in Literature " 
and other works, died at his home on the tenth of June. 
He was a lawyer by profession, and was for a term of 
years President of the Nineteenth Century Club. 

Henri Meilhac, who, both by his own unaided pen 
and in collaboration with M. Hale"vy, has contributed 
so much to the gaiety of theatre-going people, died in 
Paris on the sixth of June, at the age of sixty-five. He 
succeeded Labiche in the Academy about ten years ago. 

Mr. Edward Arnold will shortly publish Sir Harry 
Johnston's " British Central Africa," and announces 
for immediate publication Mr. Grant Allen's new book, 
" An African Millionaire." The same firm will also 
issue in sumptuous form the unique work on which Mr. 
Albert Hartshorne has been engaged so many years, 
" Old English Glasses." 

" The American Monthly Review of Reviews " is the 
new title of the popular periodical edited by Mr. Albert 
Shaw. In course of time, it will doubtless come to 
be known more briefly as " The American Monthly," 
which reminds us (obsit omen) that a magazine thus 
entitled was once published in Chicago, and came to an

early end. We are glad that the change has been 
made, although for a time it may be found a little con- 
fusing, but the magazine in question is so different from, 
and so vast an improvement upon, its English prototype, 
that it ought to have a distinctive name of its own. 

We have received the first four numbers of " La 
Diplomatic," a new semi-monthly review published in 
Paris, and edited by M. Rene" BreViaire. Its special 
field is that of diplomatic affairs and international poli- 
tics, but it has also departments of musical and theat- 
rical affairs, of society, sport, and finance. It thus 
appeals to a considerable range of interests, and we 
have found it very readable. It is attractively printed 
and well illustrated. 

Mr. Henry Frowde of the Oxford University Press 
is about to publish for the Egypt Exploration Fund 
part of a papyrus book found at Behnesa, on the edge 
of the Libyan desert, by Mr. Bernard P. Grenfell and 
Mr. A. S. Hunt of Oxford. There will be much con- 
troversy as to the antiquity of these " Logia," but it is 
not improbable that the collection was made at the be- 
ginning of the second century, or even earlier, and the 
writing of the sentences may date from the second cen- 
tury. The sayings are detached, without context, and 
each begins with the words " Jesus saith." In addition 
to reproducing the leaf by collotype process, it has been 
decided to print a cheaper edition for a few cents so 
that the treasure may be brought within the reach of 
everyone.

NOW READY. 



An American Emperor. 

The Story of the Fourth Empire of France. By Louis TRACY, 
author of " The Final War," etc. Illustrated. 8vo, $1.75. 
A dramatic story of love and adventure, in which the astute inheritor 
of the combined wealth of the richest families in America obtains com- 
mand of the government of France. 

The Dungeons of Old Paris. 

Being the Story and Romance of the most Celebrated Prisons 
of the Monarchy and the Revolution. By TIGHE HOPKINS, 
authorof" Lady Bonnie's Experiment," "NellHaffenden," 
etc. Illustrated. 8vo, $1.75. 
After a brief introduction, giving an outline of the subject, and 

showing what imprisonment was like in the olden days, Mr. Hopkins 

gives the story and romance of the most celebrated French prisons. 

The book is fascinating reading, and is full of historical anecdote. 

Bertrand du Guesclin, 

Constable of France, His Life and Times. By ENOCH VINE 
STODDARD, M.D. Illustrated. 8vo, $1.75. 
The name of Bertrand du Guesclin is held in reverence by French- 
men of to-day as that of one by whose efforts the unity of ancient 
France was secured. A great and loyal captain who, by the success of 
his arms, lifted his native land from the depths of distress and despon- 
dency and freed her from her oppressors, ... he was to his country 
in the fourteenth century what Jeanne d'Arc was in the fifteenth cen- 
tury. 

Hannibal, 

Soldier, Statesman, Patriot, and the Struggle between Car- 
thage and Rome. By WILLIAM O'CONNOR MORRIS, author 
of " Napoleon," sometime scholar of Oriel College, Oxford. 
(No. 21 in the "Heroes of the Nations Series.") Fully 
illustrated. Large 12mo, cloth, $1.50; half leather, gilt 
top, $1.75. 

Nippur ; or, Explorations and Adventures 
on the Euphrates. 

The Narrative of the University of Pennsylvania Expedition

PETERS, Ph.D., Sc.D., D.D., Director of the Expedition. 
With about 100 illustrations and plans, and with new Maps 
of the Euphrates Valley and the Ruin Sites of Babylonia. 
Two volumes, sold separately. Vol. I., The First Campaign. 
8vo, gilt top, $5.00. 

As a result of Dr. Peters's discoveries, we know that Nippur exer- 
cised on the religious life and religious development of the people of 
Babylonia an influence as potent as that of Jerusalem on our own. Dr. 
Peters's volumes not only possess scientific value and importance, but 
they will be found of decided interest as a record of travel and ad- 
venture.

Teachers' Bibles. 

NEW ILLUSTRATIONS. NEW CONCORDANCE. 
NEW HELPS. NEW MAPS. 

These TEACHERS' BIBLES contain new Bible Helps 

written by LEADING SCHOLARS in AMERICA and 

GREAT BRITAIN, and are entitled 

THE ILLUSTKATED BIBLE TREASURY. 

Upward of 350 Illustrations 

Of Ancient Monuments, Scenes in Bible Lands, Animals, 

Plants, Antiquities, Coins, etc., are distributed 

through the text of the Helps. 

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
THE INDEPENDENT says: 

" Of all the ' aids ' for the popular study of the Bible, which 
belong in the general class of Teachers' Bibles, THIS is EASILY 
FOREMOST AND BEST. . . . The marked feature of the ' Treas- 
ury ' is that every part of it is new, and that it contains none 
of that sequacious compilation which is based on works once 
in repute, but which at the best rise no higher than belated 
attempts to bring an old thing up to the gauge of a new one. 
. . . The number of contributors who hare taken part in the 
work is thirty-eight. They make a list which commands con- 
fidence and challenges admiration." 

THE SUNDAY SCHOOL WORLD says: 

"... Looking at the ' Treasury ' in its broader features, 
and as the latest ' Helps ' for Teachers' Bibles, the intelligent 
reader will, we think, pronounce it a decided advance upon 
any that have hitherto appeared. This is evident in the log- 
ical order of the material, in the proper arrangement of the 
engravings and illustrations, blended with the descriptive 
text and fitting in the place where they belong. Placing the 
Concordance, proper names and subject index under one alpha- 
betic list also has decided advantages. ... IT WILL EASILY 

TAKE A FOREMOST RANK WITH ALL BlBLE STUDENTS." 

THE UNION SIGNAL says: 

. ^. . New Bible Helps written by leading scholars in 
American and Great Britain. . . . THESE SURPASS EVERY- 
THING HERETOFORE OFFERED TO BlBLE STUDENTS." 

THE DIAL says: 

" The new ' Illustrated Bible Treasury ' reaches the acme 
in the field of Bible students' helps. The catalogue of themes 
treated and the compactness and lucidity of the articles are a 
delight to the reader. The wealth of illustrations of the best 
sort not old worn-out cuts adds greatly to the beauty 
and completeness of the articles. The natural-history sec- 
tions are especially fine in matter and make-up. The Con- 
cordance is the most complete yet produced, being adapted 
both to the Authorized and to the Revised Versions, and con- 
taining also proper names. We also find incorporated in it 
several themes which, in other helps, are found merely in 
separate sections under the dry uninteresting form of tables. 
Some of these are Messianic Prophecy, Parables in the Old 
Testament, Quotations in the New Testament for the Old. 
This feature simplifies the Bible student's task. The full 
dozen of new up-to-date maps, fully colored and indexed, are 
superb. ... Is nearest the ideal Bible student's manual of 
any publication in its field."

[Aug. 1, 1897. 



D. Appleton & Company's New Books 



Beady in August, Hall Caine's New Novel : 

THE CHRISTIAN. 

By HALL CAINE, author of " The Manxman," " The Deemster," " The Bondman," etc. Uniform edition. 

12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

This is a drama of frail human nature aspiring to perfection and struggling to attain the highest ideal. The 
story opens in the Isle of Man, but the action takes place for the most part in London, and the author's strenuous 
preparation for this book is suggested by the succession of moving and dramatic scenes from a strange and unknown 
life in the world's metropolis. His mastery of the human drama has never been shown so forcibly. The romance 
throbs with life, and the emotional force of these pictures of aspiration, temptation, love, and tragedy reaches a 
height which will make a lasting impression upon the literature of our time. 

Second Edition. 

EQUALITY. 

By EDWARD BELLAMY, author of " Looking Backward," etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
" The book is so full of ideas, so replete with suggestive aspects, so rich hi quotable parts, as to form an arsenal of argu- 
ment for apostles of the new democracy. . . . The humane and thoughtful reader will lay down ' Equality ' and regard the 
world about him with a feeling akin to that with which the child of the tenement returns from his ' country week ' to the foul 
smells, the discordant noises, the incessant strife of the wonted environment. Immense changes are undoubtedly in store for 
the coming century. The industrial transformations of the world for the past hundred years seem to assure for the next 
hundred a mutation in social conditions commensurately radical. The tendency is undoubtedly toward human unity, social 
solidarity. Science will more and more make social evolution a voluntary, self- directing process on the part of man." 
SYLVESTER BAXTER, in the Review of Reviews. 



PETER THE GREAT. 

By K. WALISZBWSKI, author of " The Romance of an Em- 
press," (Catherine II. of Russia). Translated by Lady 
MART LOYD. With Portrait. Small 8vo, cloth, $2.00. 
" One of the most interesting biographies of the historical kind we 

have read for a long time. . . . Intensely interesting because absolutely 

unique." London Daily Chronicle. 

"A finished and artistic portrait of this extraordinary man. . . . 

An elaborate character sketch." London Standard. 

FAMILIAR FEATURES OF THE ROADSIDE. 

By F. SCHUYLER MATHEWB, author of " Familiar Flowers of 

Field and Garden," " Familiar Trees and Their Leaves," 

etc. With 130 illustrations by the author. 12mo, cloth, $1.75. 

The country roads have a life of their own of great interest if one is 

properly guided, and Mr. Mathews has written his book in order to set 

forth the life of the trees, bushes, flowers, insects, and birds which are 

found along the roads. He has carried out an idea which will interest 

those who walk, or drive, or ride a wheel in the country, and the book 

will be indispensable for anyone who lives in or visits the country. 

INSECT-LIFE. 

By JOHN HENRY COMSTOCK, Professor of Entomology in Cor- 
nell University. With illustrations by ANNA BOTSFORD 
COMSTOCK, Member of the Society of American Wood En- 
gravers. 12mo, cloth, $2.50. 

A popular book of general value and interest which will meet a want 
felt by teachers and be indispensable for classes, and will also prove of 
constant service to those who have felt the need of a guide to the identi- 
fication and study of insects. It is a book for amateurs and summer 
tourists as well as for students, and is magnificently illustrated by 
Mrs. Comsfeock's accurate and beautiful wood engravings. 

SOME UNRECOGNIZED LAWS OF NATURE. 

An Inquiry into the Causes of Physical Phenomena, with 
Special Reference to Gravitation. By IGNATIUS SINGER 
and LEWIS H. BERENS. Illustrated. 12mo, cloth, $2.50. 
This is an entirely new and original work, the result of long study 
and independent practical experiment. It has grown out of the expe- 
rience of the authors in their attempts to apply the physical method of 
inquiry to the elucidation of biological problems, more especially those 
which arise in connection with the life of man. By a close examination 
of the action of force on various bodies it is hoped that a new light may 
be thrown on the laws of Nature, including the causation of phenomena. 



BARBARA BLOMBERG. 

A Historical Romance. By Dr. GEOKO EBERS, author of 
"Uarda," "Cleopatra," "Joshua," etc. Translated by 
MARY J. SAFFORD. Two vols., 16mo, cloth, $1.50 ; paper, 
SOcts. 

The time of this strong historical romance is the period of turmoil 
which followed the death of Luther, when Protestants and Catholics 
were struggling for the mastery in Germany and the Netherlands. The 
story opens in the city of Ratisbon, where Charles V. meets Barbara 
Blomberg, and is captivated by her voice, in spite of the distractions 
caused by warring princes and burghers. Later the story changes to 
the Netherlands and pictures the stirring scenes preceding the work of 
liberation. The romance offers a series of vivid sketches of dramatic 
events which had far-reaching consequences. 

WAYSIDE COURTSHIPS. 

By HAMLIN GARLAND. 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
One of the most characteristic phases of life in the West is the 
movement of its people, particularly of its young men. The latter are 
always on the road to college, to the city, to places farther west. On 
the way a woman's face often causes the young man to pause, turn, and 
perhaps remain. This motive underlies the book. On her part the 
woman finds a peculiar fascination in the passing of the stranger and 
the effect upon her life. A deeper interest still is suggested in the proem 
and elsewhere in the book. " Wayside Courtships " will be found to be a 
most significant expression of the author's strong and individual talent. 

Uniform with " Wayside Courtships." New editions of Mr. 

Garland's other books. Each, 12mo, cloth, $1.25. 
A SPOIL OF OFFICE. A Story of the Modern West. 
A MEMBER OF THE THIRD HOUSE. A Story of Political Warfare. 
JASON EDWARDS. An Average Man. 

A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE. 

By C. C. HOTCHKISS, author of " In Defiance of the King." 
No. 222, Town and Country Library. 12mo, cloth, $1.00 ; 
paper, 50 eta. 

The welcome given to " In Defiance of the King " proves the growth 
of American appreciation of new American writers of genuine talent. 
In this new romance of the Revolution Mr. Hotchkiss shows a power of 
sustained interest and a command of dramatic effects which will make 
his book a notable addition to our fiction. The scene of his stirring tale 
is laid for the most part in old New York during the British occupancy, 
on Long Island Sound, and on Martha's Vineyard. It is certain that no 
one who baa begun this spirited and fascinating story will leave it un- 
finished.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE I. 

Following our custom of several years, we 
print in this and the following issue of THE 
DIAL a summary of the literary activity of the 
past twelvemonth in the principal European 
countries, based upon the invaluable series of 
special reports contributed to the " Athenaeum " 
for July 3. Thirteen countries are covered 
altogether, and we follow the alphabetical 
arrangement of our English contemporary. ' 

Professor Paul Fredericq, writing from Bel- 
gium, records a considerable achievement in 
the department of national history, noting 
many monographs and collections of import- 
ance. Among books of travel there is " En 



Congolie," by M. Edmond Picard, who went 
out to Africa to scoff and remained to pray ; 
and a posthumous volume of " Lettres de 
Voyage," by Emile de Laveleye. In literary 
criticism there is " Dante et Ses Precurseurs," 
by M. Zanardelli, and a "Discours sur le 
Renouveau au Theatre," by the M. Picard 
already named. In belles-lettres, the " original 
and extravagant " M. Emile Verhaeren has 
produced two volumes of verse, and M. Mae- 
terlinck a collection of " Douze Chansons." 
The same M. Maeterlinck has also printed 
the prose drama " Aglavaine et Selysette," 
which certainly has an enticing title. " While 
the Flemish movement agitates all Belgium 
violently in view of a law which is to place the 
Flemish language on a complete footing of 
equality with French, which has been recog- 
nized as the official language of the kingdom 
since 1830, Flemish literature does not share 
in the polemics and the agitation of French 
literature in Belgium. It is in a state of dull 
placidity." The most noteworthy Flemish pro- 
ductions are M. Cyriel Buysse's novel, " Op't 
Blauwhuis," and a few historical studies. 

Professor V. Tille's Bohemian report may 
be illustrated by the following extracts : 

" Bohemian literature during the period 1896-7 has 
not shown so much vigour as in the preceding twelve 
months, although the number of publications is still 
very large. Many collections of verse have appeared, 
but few of them rise above mediocrity. . . . One of 
the most beautiful and powerful collections of patriotic 
verse is Neruda's posthumous Friday Songs,' which 
sprang from passionate love of his country and people, 
and show anew what a mind was lost to the Bohemian 
nation by his death. ... In fiction Bohemian litera- 
ture still lacks the modern novel of character a want 
not compensated by some attempts at shorter tales of 
this class. Stories of all kinds and shades are coming 
out as numerously as poems, but the majority of them 
do not rise above the average, and many of the produc- 
tions of even older story-tellers follow the beaten path, 
without attempting to be artistic. The best of them are 
still those that delineate minutely the life of the Bo- 
hemian country people, as the subject itself secures 
attention." 

Denmark, whose literary affairs are chroni- 
cled by Dr. Alfred Ipsen, has a somewhat more 
interesting story to tell. " Our sesthetic liter- 
ture appears to have reached a point where 
form has been developed to the highest perfec- 
tion, but it would also now and then seem as if 
we were at a loss for the material to fill in the

form." Herr H. F. Ewald, "the Nestor of 
Danish authors," has published " Liden Kir- 
sten," a new historical novel which combines 
the romantic feeling of Ingemann with the 
more exacting scholarship of the present day. 
Mollen " (" The Mill "), by Herr Karl Gjel- 
lerup, is "a big novel of country life," and 
" Ludvigsbakke," by Herr H. Bang, shows its 
author to be possessed of " some of Charles 
Dickens's keen perception of the small things 
in character and human life." Herr K. Larsen, 
in " Uden for Rangklasserne " (" Outside the 
Upper Classes"), " sketches certain sections of 
Copenhagen life and their Copenhagen slang, 
for which he has a very sharp ear." He has 
also begun publication of an intimate history of 
the War of 1864, based upon contemporary 
letters and journals. " Herr Holger Drach- 
mann, our brilliant poet, celebrated in October 
last the completion of twenty-five years of lit- 
erary work, and received recognition from 
many quarters. From the King and the Court, 
however, he received no sign of sympathy or 
regard, owing to the unsatisfactory character of 
his domestic life. The inspired and rich quality 
of his work is a feature of our literature in these 
times of spiritual decline and mannerism. Gen- 
erally so fertile, he has not this year produced 
any new volume, but has only revised and altered 
one of his plays of earlier years." An important 
undertaking in a more serious field is the great 
subscription history of Denmark, upon which 
seven of the foremost Danish historians are 
now engaged. 

M. Joseph Reinach opens his interesting ac- 
count of the year in France with some remarks 
upon the effects of free trade in literature. 
" It is probable," he says, " that the second half 
of the nineteenth century will seem to future 
history chiefly characterized, from this special 
point of view, by the activity of the literary 
exchanges between France on the one side, and 
on the other certain foreign countries, notably 
Russia, the Scandinavian peoples, England, 
and even Germany. No one can doubt that 
Tolstoy owes much to Balzac and George Sand ; 
but Tolstoy, in his turn, has exercised a con- 
siderable influence on several of our country- 
men of to-day. Ibsen, he too, derives from 
George Sand, and above all Alexandre Dumas 
the younger. ... I am ready to believe that 
the French novel has for several years past left 
its mark on the English novel, which now attacks 
subjects before which it once recoiled." M. 
Zola, we are told by M. Reinach, is losing his 
prestige in France. " All his old disciples have 



deserted him to enter on other paths, and he is 
visibly outliving his reputation." M. Bourget, 
also, has less vogue than heretofore. " It would 
be too much to say that adultery has ceased to 
take a chief place in the French novel ; but its 
place is growing less year by year. People are 
decidedly tired of this sort of story." The one 
masterpiece of the year is the Basque story of 
" Ramountcho," by " Loti." Other works of 
fiction that have attracted much attention are 
the " Jardin Secret " of M. Prevost, the " Jean 
d'Agreve " of M. de Vogue, the " Image " of 
M. Emile Pouvillon, and the " Orme du Mail " 
of M. France. The latter book " is a succes- 
sion of sketches of administrative, ecclesiastical, 
and political life in the provinces. These 
sketches are lively, witty, and their style recalls 
at once Renan and Voltaire ; but I really must 
ask readers not to believe that all our prefects 
and all our bishops resemble the figures in 
M. France's book." As for poetry, " M. Cop- 
pee has deserted it for journalism, M. Sully- 
Prudhomme for philosophy and science. M. de 
Heredia has never written, as the world knows, 
more than one volume of sonnets ; Leconte de 
L'Isle and Banville are dead, and have left no 
heirs to their places." Two new writers of 
verse, MM. F. Gregh and Rivoire, show signs 
of promise. Literary criticism and history are 
in a flourishing condition, and are illustrated 
by many good books. The Due de Broglie has 
written on Malherbe, and M. Hallays on Beau- 
marchais, for the " Grands Ecrivains Fran- 
9ais." M. Petit de Julleville's monumental 
history of French literature is making satisfac- 
tory progress. M. V. Rossel has written an 
important book on the literary relations be- 
tween France and Germany. M. Henry Har- 
risse has left Columbus for the Abbe Prevost, 
and has brought the author of " Manon Les- 
caut " into the clear light of history. M. 
Duclaux's " Pasteur " attempts " a history of 
this great spirit, the genesis of his discoveries, 
the outcome of his struggles." The celebrated 
history of " Elle et Lui " has been revived, and 
has resulted in the publication of much new 
material concerning both George Sand and 
Alfred de Musset. " The controversy, it seems, 
is lasting long enough to provide still a theme 
of animated discussion at literary dinners. I 
am not at all clear whether it would not have 
been better to let these dead people sleep undis- 
turbed in their graves." Among the more 
solid publications of the year are M. Fouillee's 
work on " The Positivist Movement," the " Car- 
nets," written in 1863-64 by Taine (" there

is in this small volume almost all the substance 
of the * Origines ' "), the Vicomte d'Avenel's 
researches on " Le Mecanisme de la Vie So- 
ciale," Leon Say's posthumous "Les Finances," 
M. Block's " Petit Dictionnaire Politique et 
Social," M. Perrens's "Les Libertins en France 
au XVIIme. Siecle," the tenth volume of MM. 
Lavisse and Rambaud's " Histoire de France," 
and endless books and memoirs relating to the 
First and Second Empires. This documentary 
literature includes the " Correspondance Ine- 
dite " of Merimee, the " Correspondance " of 
Victor Hugo, and the " Derniers Me moires 
des Autres," by Jules Simon. Even the real 
history of the Third Republic is " beginning to 
emerge from the farrago of occasional publica- 
tions," and is in a way summed up in the single 
volume of Challemel-Lacour's speeches, " a 
manual of philosophy from which all students 
of public affairs, whatever their country, can 
draw equal profit." 

" The imaginative literature of Germany," 
says Hofrath Robert Zimmermann, " is arrayed 
under the banners of realism and symbolism. 
Its strength lies in the drama. . . . On the 
other hand, lyric and narrative poetry is de- 
clining." The dramatic " prize juries " have 
awarded the honors of the year to Herr Haupt- 
mann and Herr von Wildenbruch. Probably 
the most important work of the year is Herr 
Hauptmann's fairy drama, " Die Versunkene 
Glocke." Here " the writer transports himself 
and his audience to the realm of fairyland ; the 
supernatural weapons, the elfs, the spirits of 
the water and the wood, who take part in the 
action, possess the same reality as the human 
beings, the bell-founder Heinrich and his 
family, with whose destiny elfs and mortals 
interfere, mingling in the play as in ' A Mid- 
summer Night's Dream.' " Other dramatic 
productions of the year are Herr Sudermann's 
three one-act pieces called " Morituri," Herr 
Fulda's " The Son of the Caliph," also a sort 
of fairy tale, with a Nietzschean Uebermensch 
for a hero, Herr Hirschfeld's " Die Mutter," 
Herr Hango's "Nausicaa," and Herr Eber- 
mann's " Die Athenerin." The two works last 
mentioned are Viennese productions, deriving 
from Grillparzer and Munch -Bellinghausen. 
In poetry, a new volume by Herr Detleff von 
Liliencron, including " Poggfred," styled by 
the author " a topsy-turvy epic in twelve can- 
tos," occupies the place of first importance. In 
this lyric-narrative work, " descriptions of na- 
ture, sketches of moor and heath, literary out- 
bursts of indignation and enthusiasm, Ariosto- 



like pictures of love, and Verestschaginesque 
pictures of battles alternate with pessimistic 
reflections, passages of mystical devotion, and 
references to the world's history." The author, 
we are told, " is deemed by his admirers the 
first lyric poet of the age," while " by many 
others he is regarded as one of the most gifted." 
The most important novel of the year is Herr 
Spielhagen's " Faustulus," a Pomeranian story, 
having for its hero " a doctor transferred from 
the over-intellectual atmosphere of a large town 
to a small one," and playing therein the parts 
of both Faust and Mephistopheles. "There 
are few novels which afford the reader such a 
feeling of a?sthetic contentment through scenic 
excellence and living characterization, of eth- 
ical satisfaction through the dramatic conse- 
quentially and impartial justice." Other works 
of fiction that have attracted considerable atten- 
tion are " Das Rathsel des Lebens," by Herr 
Heyse ; " Herbstreigen," by Herr von Saar ; 
" Die Siegerin," by Frau Clara Sudermann ; 
" Der Zauberer Cyprianus," by Herr von 
Wildenbruch ; " Friihschein," by Herr J. J. 
David; "Heimkehr," by " Ossip Schubin "; 
Schleichendes Gift," by Herr Adolf Wil- 
brandt ; " Im Chiemgau," a historical novel 
by Herr Felix Dahn ; and a narrative of old 
Ratisbon, by Dr. Georg Ebers. The historical 
literature of the year centres mainly about the 
Emperor William I., whose centenary was cele- 
brated in March. Professor Oncken's " Unser 
Heldenkaiser " is an " inspired " account of the 
career of the restorer of the Empire. Herr von 
Strautz's " Illustrirfce Kriegschronik " pictures 
the wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870. The death 
of the three great historians, Treitschke, Sybel, 
and Ernst Curtius, has given a heavy blow to 
historical scholarship. The quater-centenary 
of Melanchthon's birth has also called forth a 
considerable literature. Gottfried Keller's let- 
ters is the most important book of the year in 
the way of literary memoirs. There are several 
noteworthy books in philosophy and aesthetics, 
among them being Alfred von Berger's volume 
of critical essays, a monograph on the Greek 
philosophers by Herr Gompertz, a work on the 
esthetics of tragedy by Herr Johannes Volkelt, 
and Herr von Hartmann's " Kategorienlehre," 
which forms the tenth volume of the philoso- 
pher's collected works. "A publication at 
once original and symptomatic of the tendencies 
of thought among the present generation in the 
field of literature, and more especially of the 
pictorial arts, is the periodical " Pan," which 
is now in the second year of its existence, and

may be regarded as the organ of the modern 
school." 

Greece, represented in this symposium by 
Professor Lambros, contributes few items of 
interest to the year's chronicle. " The Muses 
are no friends of Mars." Dr. Kerameus has 
published some unedited letters of the Patriarch 
Photius from manuscripts preserved at Mt. 
Athos, and Professor Lambros has printed from 
the same source the fables of George -ZEtolos, 
a Greek author of the sixteenth century. More 
important for the history of modern Greek cul- 
ture is the following announcement : 

" The chief event in literature is the beginning of a 
project due to the generosity of a rich Greek who is 
settled at Odessa, a former burgomaster of that town. 
Gregor Maraslis has undertaken to make the Greeks 
acquainted with masterpieces of the historical, philo- 
logical, archaeological, and philosophical literature of 
other countries by means of the best possible translations. 
The series will be printed at Athens, and arrangements 
provide for the appearance of a part of one hundred and 
sixty large octave pages every month; the get-up is excel- 
lent, the price very low. From another point of view 
also the collection is of interest even for foreigners, as it 
will supply the best materials for the study of modern 
Greek. Later on the yearly parts will be doubled in 
number, and the library will, in accordance with the 
founder's design, also include original works, perhaps 
even pay attention to jurisprudence and medicine." 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

JAPANESE SELF-TAUGHT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have already called your attention to the increasing 
popularity of the English language in educational and 
journalistic enterprises in Japan. This renewed interest 
in that well-nigh " universal language " has arisen, of 
course, from the fact that, in about two years from 
now, when the new treaties go into effect, this entire 
Empire will be thrown wide-open. In view, therefore, 
of the near approach of " mixed residence," the Japanese 
people realize the necessity of becoming familiar with 
that language which will be spoken by the largest num- 
ber of foreigners coming to, or resident in, Japan. But 
mixed residence will not impose a duty on the Japanese 
alone; it will also bring upon the foreigners the neces- 
sity of knowing more or less of the vernacular. 

This shows to us the raison d'etre of a book recently 
published, under the ambitious title of " Japanese Self- 
Taught," by Messrs. Kelly & Walsh, of Yokohama. 
The author is a European, who has become a natural- 
ized Japanese, has taken a Japanese name, and has a 
good practical knowledge of the Japanese language. 
He says in the preface: "The book is not intended for 
learned sinologues, but for persons who, while having 
only a limited time at their disposal, desire to gain some 
insight into the construction of Japanese colloquial sen- 
tences, and to familiarize themselves with words useful 
to them in their vocations without wading through an 
intricate mass of confusing grammatical rules." 

The book is not, therefore, a grammatical treatise or 



a scientific exposition of this peculiar language ; nor is 
it ungrammatical or unscientific. It is preeminently a 
practical handbook, of which one special feature is a 
collection of five hundred colloquial phrases, given in 
both the " familiar " and the " polite " styles of speech. 
This distinction is a very important one, and is also 
very difficult; but it is very carefully expressed and 
explained in these colloquial exercises. The commercial 
vocabulary is especially comprehensive and valuable. 
On the whole, the book seems to be one which will 
prove very useful to travellers and business men in giving 
a good working knowledge of the Japanese language.

PREPARATORY ENGLISH. A TEACHER'S 

EXPERIENCE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

After reading your interesting editorial on " The 
Teaching of English Once More," I am tempted to give 
a bit of my own experience in preparing pupils for col- 
lege in English, an experience covering fifteen years. 

When I began the work, I found that by keeping my 
eye upon the examination likely to be set it was not a 
difficult task to prepare the pupils to pass " with credit "; 
but I soon found also that this method was not devel- 
oping any literary taste or love of the study; and I con- 
cluded that it would be better to give up the study en- 
tirely than that such results should follow. From that 
time I have valued the student's disposition toward his 
work his enthusiasm and love of reading far more 
than his ability to reproduce the story of which he read. 
The former I consider a much better preparation for 
doing the English work in college. I have been con- 
firmed in this opinion by the testimony of my pupils 
and the opinion of the best teachers of English in the 
colleges, Harvard, Yale, the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, and the smaller colleges generally. 

I do not imply by this that I make less of written 
work than formerly ; as a matter of fact, written work i& 
much more frequent; but after there has been created 
an interest in the subject this work loses its terrors and 
is done with pleasure and profit. 

Again, when properly related to written work, as a 
means and not an end, rhetoric becomes one of the most 
interesting of studies. Instead of having the pupil cor- 
rect the bad English of others, I set him to work upon 
his own. When I return his themebook with marginal 
signs indicating faults of diction or construction, he is 
required to rewrite the sentence in which such errors 
occur and to make a reference to the rhetoric where the 
error is discussed. This literary study, composition, 
and rhetoric are correlated in such a way that the pupil 
sees at once the organic relation of one to the other. 
The pleasure and profit of this work, both to teacher 
and pupil, may not admit of the test by the formal 
examination, but it is as real as life itself, and gives to 
every exercise its most enduring quality. 

The question which I would now ask is this : Is it not 
possible to order the examinations in English for en- 
trance to college so that the student may reveal some- 
thing of these essentials for college work, literary 
taste and love of the subject; ability to write clear, con- 
cise, and vigorous English, which in itself is evidence of 
a knowledge of the principles of rhetoric ? I believe 
that there are many classrooms where this is being done 
every day. A- j. GEORGE.

ACROSS AND AROUND SPITSBERGEN.* 

The gratification of the (to most of us) rather 
unaccountable impulse which periodically drives 
men like Sir William Martin Conway, Mr. 
MacCormick, and Mr. Whymper from the 
snug security of their " ain firesides " to the 
uttermost parts of the earth in quest of wastes 
unexplored and peaks unclimbed, is becoming 
a matter of some difficulty. To people with a 
taste for real pioneering, an up-to-date map 
offers a comparatively barren and perplexing 
prospect. The once vast areas which the old 
cartographers used to embellish with figures of 
griffins and other then not incredible monsters 
have shrunk to an insignificant stretch or two 
near the Poles. Africa is no longer a Dark 
Continent save in respect of the alleged 
" shadiness " of its stock-jobbing and land- 
grabbing operations ; and, since Nansen, people 
have already begun speaking of the North 
Pole in that tone which Jeffrey was charged 
with using toward the Equator. 

Sir William Martin Conway could hardly, 
one would think, have been beset with an em- 
barrassment of riches in the way of alluring 
fields for exploration and adventure when he 
elected to go to Spitsbergen last summer. The 
island was not inaptly described by the sport- 
ing member of Sir William's party as a land 
" botched in the making and chucked aside 
unfinished." Being the most accessible of all 
Arctic lands, Spitsbergen is the one that has 
been most frequently visited. The Gulf Stream, 
pushing its warm waters northward, melts in 
the ice-covered polar sea, an open bay extend- 
ing in summer to the 80th and sometimes even 
to the 82d parallel of north latitude. This 
bay forms a convenient avenue of approach to 
Spitsbergen, which skirts, through several de- 
grees of latitude, its eastern side. The com- 
parative accessibility of the island has marked 
it as a goal of the summer tourist. The ubi- 
quitous " trippers " are already carrying droves 
of cockneys of all nations to its ice-girt shores 
a fact that was once brought home to our 
author and his companions in a rather amusing 
way. They discovered in a particularly bleak 
and desolate spot on the coast what appeared 
to be the grave of a sailor, a lone mound

framed in a ring of stones, and bearing the 
legend : " KAPT. VOGELGESANG. S. S. Colum- 
bia. Hamburg. D. 29, 7, 1893." Much valu- 
able sentiment was bestowed on this tumulus, 
and the fate of the apparently ill-starred 
" Vogelgesang " was duly deplored : but it was 
learned some weeks later that the monument 
was one raised to commemorate a gigantic beer- 
drinking bout or Kneipe enjoyed by a party of 
tourists who had come up in the big Hamburg- 
American liner on the date given. " Assur- 
edly," says the narrator, " the vulgarization of 
Spitsbergen has begun." 

While, however, the coasts and outlying 
islands of Spitsbergen have been pretty fre- 
quently visited and partially explored, its in- 
terior was, up to the date of Sir William's 
expedition last summer, practically unknown. 
To reveal the character of this unknown in- 
terior was the main object of his journey, the 
expense of which was partly borne by the Royal 
Geographical Society. With Sir William went 
Dr. J. W. Gregory (author of the " Great Rift 
Valley of Africa "), Mr. A. Trevor-Battye, and 
Mr. E. J. Garwood, each of whom contributes 
a special chapter to the present work. The 
results of the venture in some respects sur- 
passed, in others fell short of, expectations. 
The party crossed overland from Advent Bay 
(their base of operations) to Klok Bay, from 
Klok Bay to Sassen Bay, and from Sassen to 
Agardh Bay, on the east coast, and back to 
Advent Bay. Thirteen mountain ascents were 
made. A sketch survey of a specimen area of 
about six hundred square miles in the heart of 
the middle belt of the country was brought 
home, besides a more rapid outline chart of the 
hills bordering Wijde Bay. In addition to the 
main cross-country expedition, a subsidiary one 
was made in the little touring steamer " Ex- 
pres," chartered for the purpose, round the 
coasts of Spitsbergen. The main island was 
(the condition of the ice proving exceptionally 
favorable) nearly circumnavigated, this trip 
thus forming the most complete voyage of 
reconnaissance ever accomplished in a single 
season. Almost all the great fjords that pen- 
etrate Spitsbergen were entered to their heads. 
The west, north, and south coasts of North- 
East Land were viewed, from Cape Platen 
round to Cape Mohn. Landings were made 
at the Seven Islands, and Wiches Land (King 
Carl's Land) was closely approached. Some 
six hundred photographs of all parts of Spits- 
bergen were brought back. Such were the 
topographical results. The scientific ones, says

the author, " were more important, and will be 
duly chronicled hereafter." About two months 
in all were spent at Spitsbergen, of which time 
thirty-six consecutive days were employed in 
the journey into the interior. More could have 
been accomplished had the weather been less 
persistently foggy, and had the party not been 
handicapped by their Nansen sledges. These, 
says the author, " while excellent for ice-work, 
are the worst for boggy and stony places. . . . 
Our combination of ponies with Nansen sledges 
was about the worst possible." The practical 
results of the journey were, however, as we 
have said, on the whole satisfactory ; while, 
adds Sir William, " even had we accomplished 
no exploration nor added aught to scientific 
knowledge, the journey would have been worth 
while for the mere pleasure of it." Among the 
" pleasures " may be reckoned, we presume, 
the spectacle of the vagaries of certain tourists 
found disporting themselves at Advent Bay. 
One of these especially, a gentleman who had 
come up from Trondhjen to see Herr Andree 
and his balloon, added much to the general joy. 

" His costume was most picturesque long boots, a 
long ulster, a great fur cap, a revolver slung round his 
waist, a horn over one shoulder, and a camera over the 
other. The horn, he explained, would be valuable if 
he were to be lost on the mountains whose gentlest 
sloping foot he never approached. He walked up and 
down the beach with dramatic gait, then turned towards 
the bay and solemnly fired off all the chambers of his 
revolver, after which he blew a blast on the horn. 
Then he fired off his camera in all directions, and so re- 
turned to the ship and vanished." 

Most of the tourists brought rifles with them, 
under the impression that " bears, or at least 
reindeer, herded at every point along the 
shore." Many were the narrow escapes from 
the stray shots of these " Nathaniel Winkles." 

" A bullet came close over the tent of one of my 
companions. Others whizzed near the heads of the sal- 
vage men working at the winterers' wreck. One fool- 
ish creature is said to have mistaken a photographer with 
his head under the cloth of his camera for a reindeer, 
and put a bullet through his hat. Another, when we 
were away in the little steamer on the north coast, 
stalked, and I believe fired, upon our inoffensive ponies." 

In August, while circumnavigating Spits- 
bergen in the " Expres," Sir William touched 
at Danes Island, the scene of Herr Andree's 
preparations for his proposed aerial voyage to 
the Pole. The invitation of this intrepid (some 
say rash) aeronaut to go over his balloon-house 
with him was eagerly accepted. 

". . . We were shown how the gas was made, and 
the long silk pipe meandering among the stones to con- 
vey it into the balloon. The great distended sphere 



filled the roofless wooden house and bulged out above. 
Like all balloons, when seen near at hand, it appeared 
surprisingly large. It is related of a shy curate, who 
had sat in absolute silence throughout a dinner at the 
squire's house, that with the coming of desert he sud- 
denly remarked, apropos of nothing, ' The cuckoo is a 
larger bird than you 'd suppose.' The same general 
statement I maintain to be true of balloons. They are 
all larger than you would suppose. . . . No one could 
see Andre*e and not be struck by the evident force and 
capacity of the man. In his presence, the idea that any 
wavering of intention found place in his mind was 
inconceivable. Pestered, as he had been for weeks, by 
inquisitive visitors, he seemed on the defensive, and 
suspicious of criticism in every question. He had been 
told that his scheme was in every respect impracticable. 
' They said I could not set up and inflate my balloon in 
this place. I have set it up and inflated it. They said 
it would not hold the gas for a sufficient time without 
leakage. It has now been inflated for ten days or more, 
and it does not leak. There were two little needle-point 
holes only, and those were easily mended. We have 
considered everything and provided against every acci- 
dent, and now we are certain that, whenever the right 
wind blows, we can start without a hitch. It is not 
enough for me that the wind should be from the right 
quarter. I must have a chance of decent weather, so 
that we may be able to see something. . . . There is 
always plenty of wind early in the season. Three days 
of a moderate wind, blowing approximately from the 
south, is all we need. After that the wind may blow 
how it pleases, it cannot help taking us toward some of 
the land that encircles the polar ocean. We can re- 
main afloat for three weeks, and in that time, with any 
luck, we ought to be carried down to some habitable 
country.' " 

It seems clear that good luck, no less than good 
management, is relied upon by Herr Andree to 
bring his venture to a successful issue. 

While Sir William's adventures in the frozen 
north were not, comparatively speaking, of a 
specially thrilling or novel order, the story of 
them is pleasantly told and affords a clear 
impression of a considerable specimen tract in 
the hitherto unknown interior of Spitsbergen. 
The descriptions of Arctic scenery are notably 
graphic, supplemented as they are by a profu- 
sion of excellent pictures, comprising eight 
large colored plates reproduced in facsimile 
from Mr. H. E. Conway's drawings, and about 
one hundred full-page and text illustrations

THE EVOLUTION OF A CONSTITUTION.* 



The American concept of a Constitution 
differs radically and fundamentally from the 
British concept. The difference is so great 
that the ordinary student of his own system is 
constantly embarrassed in his efforts to under- 
stand the corresponding features of the trans- 
Atlantic system. The American constitution 
is established, surrounded by a protective en- 
vironment, made independent of legislative 
changes, and has an appearance of fixity. The 
British constitution seems, to an American 
versed in the principles of his own system, to 
be so variable, so transitory, and so illusive, as 
to scarcely deserve the name of " constitution." 
Yet the Briton prefers his own system, believes 
it a true " constitution," and deems the Amer- 
ican plan to be straight-laced, repressive, and 
tyrannical, and therefore less fitted than his 
own to the genius of a free people. So variant 
from each other are these two systems of gov- 
ernment, that the provisions of the one are 
scarcely " thinkable " to those immersed in the 
ideas and concepts which distinguish the other. 

It is the object of Professor Macy's treatise 
on " The English Constitution " to make its 
peculiar principles " thinkable " to the average 
American. By this means, he seeks to enable 
students in our colleges more fully to contrast 
the British institutions with our own, and thus 
to understand more clearly the features which 
distinguish the American constitution. Such a 
treatise naturally takes a popular form, which 
will commend it to the attention of a wide circle 
of readers. Very properly, the author presents 
it, not as a substitute for the treatises of English 
jurists on their own constitution, but as an 
introduction to those treatises for American 
students. 

The period of the estrangement and separa- 
tion of the American colonies from the mother- 
country was one of protracted discussion con- 
cerning the nature and character of the British 
constitution. The plan of artificial alterations 
of that constitution, to conform to modern 
views, had been proposed, only to be rejected, 
in England. With the exception of the changes 
introduced by the Bill of Rights and the Suc- 
cession Act, the development of the constitution 
of the empire was allowed to " drift." That 
changes in that constitution were imminent, 
was apparent to the colonists ; indeed, it was

Nature and Growth. By Jesse Macy, M.A. New York:

their unalterable opposition to the changes pro- 
posed by the parliamentary party, and their 
adherence to the constitutional principles under 
which they had built up their colonial govern- 
ments, that brought upon the colonists the mil- 
itary power of England, resulting in the war of 
the Revolution and the withdrawal from the 
empire. The Atlantic-wide isolation of the 
colonies, and the extent of their reliance on the 
provisions of their charters, naturally developed 
a disposition toward written constitutions. 
Given this disposition, joined to a conservatism 
which adhered to the principles of the old con- 
stitution of the empire, given, on the other 
hand, the laissez-faire disposition in the islands 
to allow the constitution to be changed by leg- 
islation, as occasion might arise, and we have 
two distinctive theories of government, which 
in a little more than a century have developed 
into the two types of constitution, so radically 
diverse that each has its own vernacular, which 
must be studied by itself, and for a thorough 
comparison of the two there must be transla- 
tion of the terms of the one into the language 
appropriate to the other. Mr. Macy furnishes 
the key for such a translation of the principles 
of the unwritten British constitution into the 
American vernacular. 

The first part of his treatise sets forth the 
powers of the several governmental agencies of 
the British system, namely, the two houses of 
Parliament, the Crown, the Ministry, and the 
Courts, and explains the " checks and bal- 
ances " of that system. The essentials of these 
several agencies, in the constitution as now 
operative, are tersely stated, and their points of 
difference from their American correlatives are 
sharply accentuated. The "checks and bal- 
ances " which in America inhere in the written 
constitution are in England found, not in the 
law, but in what Mr. Dicey happily calls " the 
conventions of the constitution." Says Mr. 
Macy : 

" The constitution, viewed simply as a combination of 
the forces which centre in the House of Commons, con- 
sists of certain habits, customs, and understandings, in 
accordance with which the separate parts are harmonized 
and prevented from mutual encroachments." 

And how are these understandings enforced 
and these encroachments prevented ? Not by 
appeal to the courts. Following Mr. Dicey in 
his "Law of the Constitution," Mr. Macy 
explains in more condensed form the mode in 
which the English " conventions " check and 
balance. The conservatism of old political 
habits has as full sway in government as the 



68 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



conservatism of old fashions has in the cus- 
tomary dress of the people. He says : 

" I once tried to point out to a Birmingham Radical 
the perils of the English Constitution. He replied that 
every Englishman was at heart conservative; that this 
was as true of the laboring man as of the nobility. The 
checks which the American expects to enforce by judi- 
cial process, the Englishman expects to maintain by the 
state of mind of the citizen." 

And what is the office of the English courts ? 
Do they not enforce the principles of Magna 
Charta, and protect the liberty and rights of 
the free man ? Yes ; but not against the legis- 
lature. It is against encroachments by the 
ministerial officers that the courts set them- 
selves. The judiciary do not undertake to check 
the legislative department, as under the Amer- 
ican system. Hence there is no such vast 
growth or development of constitutional juris- 
prudence as in this country. 

How the present governmental agencies have 
been evolved out of those which distinguished 
the earlier constitution of England, is enter- 
tainingly shown by Mr. Macy. The old prin- 
ciples which were thought to be essential to that 
constitution, have been ostensibly preserved ; 
but how transformed ! The prerogative of the 
Crown, that relic of despotism, that ready 
weapon of the tyrant, that bulwark of " the 
divine right to rule," has not been abolished, 
but has been perpetuated as a power of the 
cabinet, and transmuted in their hands into the 
active agent of modern democracy. To illus- 
trate in these columns the details of the evolu- 
tion, in this and other features of the British 
constitutional system, would be to reprint here 
page after page of Mr. Macy's treatise. 

The second part of his work is a commentary 
upon the constitutional history of England. 
Here the processes of political evolution, which 
have given to the majority of the House of Com- 
mons the extensive powers of government which 
were once exercised by Tudors and Stuarts, are 
traced with sufficient detail to make them clear 
to non-British readers. The revolution is shown 
to have been more evolutionary than revolu- 
tionary, the principal change effected thereby 
having been the final rooting up and destruc- 
tion of the old pretense of a divine right to rule, 
while the Tudor and Stuart idea of a unified 
and concentrated government has been retained 
as a distinguishing feature of rule by the House 
of Commons. The genesis and the develop- 
ment of the Cabinet ; the rise of political par- 
ties ; the continuing antithesis of the " conserv- 
ative " and " liberal " party principles ; the 
respective offices of cabinet, ministry, and par- 



ties, in the work of government ; the general 
tendency toward democracy, and the increase 
of that tendency under the Reform Act, all 
these are illustrated in running commentary by 
Mr. Macy. The present English idea of a 
" Constitution " as a something fundamental in 
the government of the empire, is of modern 
origin ; and its genesis and evolution are traced 
by our author. The puzzle, the mystery, as 
that constitution appears to be to numerous 
Americans, is analysed and explained : it is 
shown to inhere largely in the conservative re- 
tention of old forms and doctrines of govern- 
ment put to new uses. The powers once exer- 
cised by tyrants are harnessed to the plough of 
modern democracy, and are made to prepare 
the fallow fields for the growth of progressive 
ideas. A stubborn conservatism adheres to old 
forms, while it fills them full of radical ideas. 
" The Queen, the Lords, and the Commons " 
profess to unite in enacting measures that work 
the will of the Commons only ; and the Com- 
mons find it easier to work their own absolute 
will by the employment of what seem to Amer- 
icans to be merely effete fictions in government. 
If, after all, the system still appears to us to be 
an anomaly, Professor Macy helps us to see 
how it happens that the anomalous can have a 
normal and useful operation.

THE DECORATIVE ILLUSTRATION 
OF BOOKS.* 



The history of the fine arts is everywhere, 
among civilized peoples, a record of the influ- 
ence of a succession of ideas, each in turn dom- 
inating for a longer or shorter period the char- 
acter of what is produced. As soon as an idea 
becomes commonplace it ceases to yield full 
aesthetic satisfaction to cultivated minds. In 
the search for novelty some one among the 
many seekers happens upon a conception that 
captivates popular fancy ; other artists lay hold 
of it also, work it over, develope and extend it, 
until it too becomes commonplace, and some 
new notion, or an old one resurrected, attracts 
attention instead. Time was when these move- 
ments were of sufficient duration for the forma- 
tion of schools and of styles. But with the 
increased knowledge of past achievement placed 
before us through the invention of numerous

cheap reproductive processes, and the restless 
craving for constant change which is so con- 
spicuous a feature in modern life, they tend 
to become shorter and shorter and to degen- 
erate into mere passing fads ; nor is it unusual 
for more than one to be in progress at the same 
time. 

The closing decades of the nineteenth cen- 
tury have witnessed many such movements. 
Among them none is more noteworthy than 
the development of what bids fair to reach the 
dignity of a distinct school of decorative book 
illustration. The pioneer in this movement, 
and for many years almost its sole exponent, 
was Walter Crane. It seems, therefore, pecu- 
liarly fitting that a book treating u Of the Dec- 
orative Illustration of Books, Old and New " 
should come from his hand ; it is all the more 
disappointing that the result should be meagre 
and unsatisfying. Mr. Crane takes pains to 
state that his book, which owes its origin to 
three Cantor Lectures delivered by him before 
the Society of Arts in 1889, was written " in 
the intervals snatched from the absorbing work 
of designing." While this in a measure ac- 
counts for its deficiencies, it hardly explains 
why so much should be left unsaid. Instead 
of carefully tracing out the causes of the move- 
ment and following its development from year 
to year and from hand to hand, as we should 
naturally expect, he has given us merely a con- 
siderable number of pictures, accompanied by 
a collection of rather disconnected remarks 
upon illuminated manuscripts and the illustra- 
tion of early printed books ; some appreciative, 
if not always discriminating, comment on the 
work of contemporary artists ; and here and 
there a few words upon decorative principles. 
What he says is for the most part sound and 
well-considered, but it falls far short of consti- 
tuting a comprehensive survey of his subject. 
It may be noted, also, that the English is occa- 
sionally slipshod, as in the following sentence : 
" Although the designs have no Persian char- 
acter about them which one would have thought 
the poem and its imagery would naturally have 
suggested, yet they are a fine series." 

The movement now in progress Mr. Crane 
calls a " revival," but this is true in a limited 
sense only. There is a world of difference 
between the purely adventitious qualities, the 
crude simplicity and naivete resulting from 
inability to overcome technical difficulties, 
which the works of the early designers exhibit, 
and the deliberate self-restraint that distin- 
guishes the designs of the modern men. In 



spite of superficial resemblance, the difference 
is not merely one of degree or of process : it is 
a difference in kind. Imitation being much 
easier than invention, with but few exceptions 
the general tendency of graphic art in all coun- 
tries and in all times has been toward as much 
realism as the artists were able to represent. 
The earlier designers of book illustrations, 
although dominated by conventional ideas in 
regard to treatment, achieved decorative effect 
less through conscious aim in that direction 
than from inability to compass greater realism. 
Concurrently, with increased command of the 
resources of expression came a decline in per- 
ception of the higher qualities of harmonic rela- 
tion of line, mass, and light-and-dark, which are 
distinguishing characteristics of all enduring 
achievement. The reopening of our eyes to 
these fundamental qualities is directly attribu- 
table to the influence of the art of Japan the 
one country in the world where they have never 
been lost sight of, but on the contrary have 
ever been insisted upon as prime essentials. 
Perhaps the most interesting item of informa- 
tion which Mr. Crane gives is the statement 
made in speaking of his early designs for chil- 
dren's books which have made his name a 
household word on both sides of the Atlantic : 
" It was, however, the influence of some Japanese 
printed pictures given to me by a lieutenant in the navy, 
who had brought them from there [sic] as curiosities, 
which I believe, though I drew inspiration from many 
sources, gave the real impulse to that treatment in 
strong outlines, and flat tints and solid blacks, which I 
adopted with variations in books of this kind from that 
time (about 1870) onwards." 

In spite of this admission, it is apparent from 
what he says a few pages further on that Mr. 
Crane has never really learned to understand 
Japanese art nor to appreciate its higher qual- 
ities. Why this should be so, considering his 
accomplishments as a designer, it is difficult to 
comprehend. When he says that " They may 
be able to throw a spray of leaves or a bird or 
fish across a blank panel or sheet of paper, 
drawing them with such consummate skill and 
certainty that it may delude us into the belief 
that it is decorative design ; but if an artist of 
less skill essays to do the like the mistake be- 
comes obvious," it is plain that he does not 
perceive that the controlling idea in the mind 
of the Japanese artist is composition compo- 
sition of line in which each leaf or branch or 
smallest detail must be right in its harmonic 
relation to every other detail without violating 
truth of form or of structure, and composition 
of mass in which the shape and proportion of 



70

the blank spaces and the value of the contrast 
afforded by them is as much a matter for 
thoughtful consideration as any other element 
that enters into the result. If this is not deco- 
rative design, then what is it? Surely it is 
widely removed from what Mr. Crane aptly 
denominates " the art of pictorial statement." 
As if further to emphasize his misunderstand- 
ing, he reproduces as examples of Japanese 
decorative illustration a drawing (divided into 
two) by Hokusai, from the " Mangwa," a book 
of miscellaneous sketches entirely pictorial in 
their intention. It is true, as Mr. Crane says, 
that Japanese books " do not furnish fine ex- 
amples of page decoration as a rule." But, on 
the other hand, neither do English, French, 
German, or American books ; in Japan, as 
elsewhere, we must turn to the works of par- 
ticular men for that. Were Mr. Crane familiar 
with the range of Japanese book- illustration, 
he would have had no difficulty in finding ex- 
amples in which the design is arranged so as to 
fill the space completely a point he lays much 
stress upon, but which is far easier to accom- 
plish than the subtle balancing of form and 
blank space that he does not seem to appre- 
ciate. 

The real value of the book lies in the pictures, 
which fill nearly two- thirds of its 335 pages. 
For the most part they have been selected with 
excellent judgment, but are distributed through- 
out the text in such a manner as to make the 
book a troublesome one to read ; while their con- 
nection with the author's remarks is so slight 
that they cannot in any exact sense of the word 
be said to illustrate them. With scarcely an 
exception, however, each one is interesting for 
itself, and while some of them suffer from too 
great reduction and others from inharmonious 
setting, they are on the whole very well repro- 
duced. Taken together, they form a service- 
able collection for students of decorative illus- 
tration. While it cannot be said of the examples 
given of works by contemporary artists that 
they furnish an adequate representation of the 
aims and tendencies of the school, it is perhaps 
inevitable that a collection made up from the 
works of a considerable number of men of vary- 
ing merit should reveal the weakness inherent 
in the movement rather than its strength, to 
show which it should be limited to the best 
works of the leading men. And this is espe- 
cially true of a movement which as yet has 
been more fruitful of promise than of matured 

performance. -n, m ^

THE ETERNAL, PROBLEM OF THE 
BALKANS.* 



A book that throws light on the Eastern 
Question is always timely, for the question is 
eternal ; but the present complications in the 
peninsula give special interest and value to 
Mr. William Miller's work on Roumania, Bul- 
garia, Servia, and Montenegro. Each of the 
petty divisions is a sensitive spot, and the 
interests of no one of them can be touched 
without an instant disturbance in the others. 
There are the conflicting race feelings, first of 
Turk and Christian, then of Slav and Greek ; 
there are the mighty plans and jealousies, racial 
and commercial, of Russia and Austria, and the 
petty race and national animosities of Bulgaria 
and Servia and Greece. Anything that ex- 
plains the historical origins of these animosities, 
and lays bare their roots, has interest for the 
reading public in its inquiries into present con- 
ditions and its forecasts of the future. 

Mr. Miller's book is a collection of four brief 
outline histories of about a hundred pages each, 
written in a straightforward way without pre- 
tense and without special literary skill, cover- 
ing the whole period in each from the times of 
the Roman sway to the present day. It is not 
easy to find pleasure in the long series of brawls, 
assassinations, raids, and treacheries that make 
up most of the annals of these countries. But 
for the present interest in the relations of these 
states, few would read them whose patriotism 
did not glorify them. But the book explains 
so much in which we have an interest that it 
commends itself to students of current politics 
for its matter as well as for its impartiality. 

It is the author's belief that " the only true 
settlement of the mutually conflicting claims of 
these historic states, which periodically endan- 
ger the peace of Europe, is a Balkan Confed- 
eration, such as was sketched by the late 
M. Tricoupis." Yet he lets the facts speak 
for themselves, and hints at no method of 
bringing about this hoped-for settlement. And 
the facts, one must admit, offer little promise 
of a settlement based on any compromise of 
national claims, or of any firm union of the hos- 
tile races. There is not yet developed enough 
of political self-control or of practical political 
sense among these new nations to permit such 
a settlement or such a union for a long time to 
come. And yet, increasing familiarity with

modern political methods and increasing pres- 
sure of financial and political conditions may 
bring about the subordination of sentimental 
considerations and the compromise of opposing 
claims sooner than might be expected. 

The individuality of these several peoples is 
brought out by Mr. Miller in an interesting way. 

" It has been truly said that the Montenegrin is the 
exact opposite of the Bulgarian. Put both in a drawing- 
room, and the Montenegrin, who has never bowed his 
neck to a foreign master, will look and behave like a 
gentleman, while the Bulgarian, but lately set free from 
the Turkish bondage, will look and behave like a boor. 
Put the two upon a waste plot of ground, and the Bul- 
garian will convert it into a garden of roses, while the 
Montenegrin will look on. This is the result of the 
national history." 

This history is Homeric, as are the political 
institutions of the people. The author quotes 
with approval Mr. Gladstone's extravagant 
utterance : " In my deliberate opinion, the 
traditions of Montenegro, now committed to 
His Highness (Prince Nicholas) as a sacred 
trust, exceed in glory those of Marathon and 
Thermopylae, and all the war-traditions of the 
world." But this Homeric glory gives less 
promise of prosperity under twentieth-century 
conditions than the common plodding virtues of 
their plebeian neighbors. Yet even the Mon- 
tenegrins are abandoning the patriarchal and 
predatory life for a constitution and trade. 

Full justice is done in this work to the states- 
manship of M. Stambuloff, but his serious 
faults are not covered. Prince Alexander is 
portrayed with enthusiastic admiration. His 
military prowess, his organization of the army 
of Bulgaria, and his social charms, made him 
" the best possible ruler of a country like Bul- 
garia in time of war ; but he was lamentably 
deficient in the arts of a statesman." And this 
was the cause of his undoing at the hands of 
Eussia, whose plans for the absolute control of 
Bulgaria his patriotism had brought to naught. 
This story of Alexander's reign and fall is the 
most spirited portion of the book. As to 
Alexander's Machiavellean successor, Mr. 
Miller is non-committal, giving a negative 
description that is much more favorable to him 
than is the current opinion. Prince Nicholas 
of Montenegro is evidently a favorite with the 
author, and King Charles of Roumania receives 
high praise for his civic and military virtues. 

The way in which Eussia has wrested one 
Balkan state after another from the Turks, only 
to turn gratitude to hostility by her domineer- 
ing and grasping policy, is one of the interesting 
points of the book. Russia's position in the 



peninsula was a few months ago hardly stronger 
than at the beginning of the century ; while 
broader statesmanship would have put her at 
the head of a group of loyal dependent states, 
and thus in virtual control of the whole pen- 
insula. CHARLES H. COOPER. 



FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY.* 

Some time since, in commenting on a group of 
religious books, we drew attention to the increasing 
force of the historical element in the interpretation 
of religion. We have occasion to renew the obser- 
vation in connection with the books now before us. 
A thorough study of doctrine, in its historical de- 
velopment, is sure to carry with it a new estimate 
of its value and its relation to human life. It is in 
the record of events that the potency and the impo- 
tency of beliefs finally declare themselves. 

To this statement we add, as an associated truth, 
the ultimate identity of faith and philosophy. A 
sound philosophy gives us the basis of faith ; and 
faith, in pushing its inquiries, encounters constantly 
the reasons for and against its conclusions found in 
the underlying philosophy. Whatever objections 
or confirmations science may offer to faith, the ulti- 
mate tribunal is that higher reason which we desig- 
nate as philosophy. Philosophy is sure to renew 
itself with every generation. It is the unfailing 
effort of the mind to understand itself of the 
reason to complete itself, returning to its own centre 
with all its stores of knowledge. This fellowship 
of faith and philosophy has always been apparent, 
and is the more apparent as the capricious elements 
involved in the supernatural are eliminated. The 
thought of faith is the strength of reason in the 
highest range of our experience the conjoint edu- 
cation of the mind and heart in apprehending and 
comprehending the spiritual world in which we are. 
Science deals with the world as physical ; philosophy 
deals with it as spiritual ; and religion works the 
results of both into the most comprehensive and 
vital experience.

course of the Lyman Beecher Lectures at Yale. 
These lectures have usually been of a sprightly 
character, growing directly out of the experience of 
some large-minded preacher, and delivered under the 
stimulus of being directed to those about to engage 
in the same form of service. They have been stim- 
ulating rather than instructive, and practical in a 
large rather than in a narrow way. The nine lec- 
tures before us are a favorable example of their 
kind. They are on such themes as " The Genesis 
of a Sermon," " Problems of Preaching," " The 
New Dogma," " The Minister's Care of Himself." 
They are full of the inner life of the speaker, are 
clear and pleasing in style, and are sustained by a 
constant and light play of the imagination. They 
cannot fail to interest all who hold in high esteem 
the work of the minister. They are the expression 
of successful service, and enter in a familiar man- 
ner into the secrets of its power. 

" The Gospel for an Age of Doubt " is also a 
volume of Yale Lectures. It does not stand for 
quite as spontaneous, free, and varied a personal 
experience as the previous volume ; but it flows none 
the less with a strong, full current, from the heart 
of the man. It is an excellent representation of 
what we are having manifold examples of an 
effort to make the words and character of Christ 
the centre of belief and persuasion. " The deep 
question, the important question, the question of 
widest interest, is what to preach to the men and 
women of to-day, to cheer them, to uplift them, to 
lead them back to faith and through faith to a brave, 
full, noble life" (page VI.). The volume has a 
finished form. The thought is quickened by a wide 
familiarity with stimulating religious literature, and 
supported by a voluminous appendix of excerpts. 
The author has spared no pains to make the lectures 
a suitable utterance of the overruling idea. They 
have a deep inspiration of faith which adapts them, 
not merely to those who preach Christ, but to all 
who believe in him. 

The volume on " The Nicene Theology " is com- 
posed of lectures given in the Princeton Theological 
Seminary by Professor Scott of Chicago Theological 
Seminary. Their purpose is to establish the essen- 
tial soundness of that Christian development of doc- 
trine which issued in the Council of Nice and the 
Nicene Creed. The discussion is especially influ- 
enced by the distinctive criticism of Schultz and 
others, separating the words of Christ from the doc- 
trinal and historical facts associated with them. 
' A recent critic of this position maintains that 
Bitschl lands in only three fundamental doctrines, 
namely, trust in God, faithfulness to duty, and uni- 
versal love to man" (page 17). The cry in the- 
ology, Back to Christ, has much the same difficulty 
as the cry in philosophy, Back to Kant. Neither of 
them is profitable as an exact direction. Both of 
them should mean a divesting of the mind of un- 
profitable subtleties, and returning to more practical 
spiritual ideas. Our wisdom lies not so much in 
going back to Christ, trying once more to construct 



the doctrinal force and exact historical settings of 
His words, as in going forward with Christ, appre- 
hending and fulfilling His regenerative purpose. 
We are to arrive at the heart of His doctrine by 
doing His will. A discussion which critically undoes 
past work in theology or critically does it over 
again is not going back to Christ as a spiritual 
power, but is a fresh casting of lots over His vest- 
ments. Christ becomes the plaything of philosophy, 
as a doll is the plaything of children who dress and 
undress it in endless sequence. Professor Scott is 
erudite, and full of material, but he does not show 
much analytic and condensing power in presenting 
his subject. The less learned pupil would be quite 
sure to lose his way in this accumulation of state- 
ment and criticism. We are at a loss to understand 
why the opinions of every German every blessed 
one of them should be regarded as a new and 
important fact to be dealt with in theology. A 
generation so superheated by scholarship yields a 
good deal of very volatile matter. 

The two volumes entitled " God the Creator and 
Lord of All " are made up of eleven hundred and 
thirty compact pages. They discuss the nature of 
God, His creation, His government, physical and 
moral. The attitude of the author is one of mild 
orthodoxy. Reason, with him, underlies the entire 
framework of thoughts and things. The basis of 
his philosophy is intuitional. The work is carefully 
elaborated, and, without being brilliant or impres- 
sive, is full of sober thought. It neither goes astray 
nor leads astray. The work is a philosophy of our 
higher spiritual conceptions. While one would not 
venture to say that these volumes are the last of 
this species, he cannot but feel that the species is 
one soon to disappear. It has already much fallen 
off since the twenty sound volumes of Gerhard. 
Like some noble form of life that frequented the 
mountains or abounded on the plains, and in its own 
era drew at once the attention, but is now hard to 
be found, the systems of systematic theology which 
have followed each other in prolific generation no 
longer express the power nor claim the position that 
once fell to them. They are too much elaborated 
from within ; they are too exact and rigid in their 
conclusions ; they give more attention to the pro- 
cesses of thought than to the ever-growing data of 
thought, and often overlook data because they have 
found no sufficient place for them. The practical 
empirical side of life is nearer to us than ever, mak- 
ing its own demand on our speculative processes. 

The " History of Christian Doctrine " belongs to 
the " International Theological Library." This 
itself is a promise of careful and adequate work, a 
promise the volume fulfils. A history of doctrine, 
like a history of philosophy, though the doctrines 
and the systems may disappear, always remains an 
intensely interesting record of human life. Such a 
history calls for keen insight and wide sympathy. 
The volume before us is comprehensive and com- 
pact. It is exceedingly full, and at the same time 
very concise. It is thus better fitted for reference,

and less fitted to make a single and forceful impres- 
sion. It treats of ancient, mediaeval, and modern 
theology. The last division is especially complete 
and interesting. The author enters into his narra- 
tive as one of living experiences, and gives it a 
biographical cast. The personal side attracts him 
quite as much as the speculative side. Professor 
Fisher makes a distinction between theology and 
philosophy which is hardly satisfactory, and which 
affects somewhat his own presentation. " The- 
ology discusses the facts of Christianity. Philos- 
ophy begins with the data of consciousness, and 
builds them into a system by a process in which 
historical events have no place." We should hold, 
rather, that the explanatory process is essentially 
the same in theology and in philosophy. The facts 
of Christianity must be rendered on their rational 
side as the basis of doctrine, and the data of con- 
sciousness must be interpreted as the experiences of 
mind in contact with the world, or they can give no 
safe footing to thought. Neither set of data can be 
separated from their historic evolution. 

" Evil and Evolution " is a noteworthy book. It 
is a piece of well-reasoned philosophy on the origin 
of evil. The presentation is clear, comprehensive, 
and penetrating. The author justly feels that the 
central idea the idea most of all to be watched over 
in a rational construction of the spiritual world is 
the conception of the character of God, the good- 
ness of God. If we lose or obscure this, all is doubt, 
confusion, fear. The writer returns to the concep- 
tion which has been so prevalent in faith, that of a 
perverse principle a Satanic Personality as the 
source of evil ; thus relieving the character of God 
from a burden not otherwise to be escaped. The 
point is argued with much fulness and large re- 
sources of physical knowledge. It is not made to 
rest on Christian faith or any phase of faith. The 
volume is one fitted to deeply interest those whose 
minds linger about such inquiries. It is in many 
ways suggestive, and is a good antidote to a dog- 
matic and flippant temper. Its conclusions are, 
however, so directly against the entire drift of 
speculative thought at present, that it will hardly 
do more than make a ripple. While there are many 
points of which one would desire to speak, we must 
satisfy ourselves with referring to two or three. 
The author, in common with a good many others, 
seems to us to misrender the omnipotence of God. 
Omnipotence can only mean the power to do what 
is capable of being done. It looks to physical re- 
sources. Omnipotence cannot make one scheme of 
action to include the advantages of all schemes, nor 
enable it to escape the evils incident to it. A scheme 
is to be judged by its entire makeup of tendencies. 
These are not capable of every combination, but 
only of certain combinations. The question con- 
cerning the Spiritual Universe is not whether it 
includes evil, but whether, taken as one whole, it is 
an inadmissible combination of good and evil. The 
evil must in every case be weighed with the good with 
which it is associated. The author would not deny 



this assertion, but he has not felt its full force. Nor 
does the writer feel, as fully as he ought, the present 
entire coherence of the spiritual world, rendering 
any intervention of Satan, any conflict between the 
two Principles of Evil and Good, inadmissible. The 
world is being rid of evil, but by exactly the same 
processes as those which include it. The author 
makes too much of happiness as happiness. He is 
in the empirical slough on that subject. Selfishness 
and love extend down to the vegetable kingdom. 
His new adjustments would primarily make the 
world more pleasurable, not more spiritually power- 
ful ; would give it an instinctive and organic cast, 
not a free and holy one. The dramatic power of 
the spiritual world is not adequately rendered by 
him. 

" The Philosophy of Belief " is the most imposing 
volume of our present series. It stands associated 
with and in completion of " The Reign of Law " 
and " The Unity of Nature " by the same author. 
The characteristic of all three books is their vigorous 
hold of the physical world on the one hand, and of 
the spiritual world on the other. Very few authors 
pursue so unswerving a path between science and 
faith ; few so well apprehend the unity of the world as 
a physical and spiritual product. The present vol- 
ume lays emphasis on the spiritual side of life, dis- 
closes it as thoroughly interwoven in the framework 
of things, and as immutable in its leading principles 
as are the physical laws with which it is associated. 
The spiritual world is as much a part of the entire 
world as are the atmosphere and sunlight and clouds 
of the earth they enclose. The topics of the volume 
are intuitive theology in which the interlock of 
perceptive and intuitive truths is traced, the the- 
ology of the Hebrews and Christian theology in 
which spiritual principles find fullest expression, 
and Christian belief in its relation to philosophy. 
The style of the author is voluminous and discur- 
sive, but the thought is easily intelligible, and gains 
great cumulative power. To those who at all share 
the convictions of the writer, the unmistakable and 
eternal foundations of truth seem to be disclosed. 
He thus defines the purpose of philosophy : 

" But we must never forget that the original meaning 
of the word denotes no less than the love and desire of 
knowledge in that largest sense which is identified with 
the pursuit of Wisdom. It represents the constant 
struggle and desire of men to bring their own thoughts 
and conceptions more and more into conscious corre- 
spondence with the system of the universe in which they 
live. There can be no higher aim than this. It affords 
room for the exercise of all the most powerful faculties 
we possess. It is an aim which not only must include 
theology, but must regard it as the central and ultimate 
object of attainment. If there be a universe at all, the 
great endeavor of philosophy must be to conceive how 
its unity can be made intelligible, and on the other 
hand to understand how it is that, in some aspects, it so 
often appears as if it were divided." 
Philosophy and religion both rest on the intelligi- 
bility pervasive and complete of the world in 
which we are. JOHN BASCOM.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

lish literature Professor Edward Dowden's Prince- 
a* affected by the ton lectures upon " The French Revo- 
French Revolution. lution and English Literature" have 
been published in a neat volume (Scribner), and 
make interesting reading, although they traverse 
exceedingly familiar ground, and bring to their sub- 
ject in the way of illumination little that is new. 
In this respect they are something of a disappoint- 
ment ; for we have a right to expect much of Pro- 
fessor Dowden in the way of interpretative comment 
and philosophical treatment. We get, however, 
little of these things, but instead a straightforward 
history of revolutionary thought in England, begin- 
ning with the precursors and theorists of the move- 
ment, with Cowper and the author of " Sandf ord 
and Merton," with Godwin and Mary Wollstone- 
craft, going on with the conservative reaction so 
eloquently championed by Burke, and finally dis- 
cussing the effect of the new ideas upon Burns, 
Southey, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, and 
Landor. The subject is of so intense an inherent 
interest that a dull book could hardly be made of it, 
and nothing akin to dulness may be predicated of 
the book before us. It is simply sober rather than 
brilliant, although it now and then, in some epi- 
grammatic sentence, almost partakes of the latter 
quality. It is pleasant to be told of eighteenth 
century sentimentalism that " the first of duties was 
no longer to act aright, but to be touched by a deli- 
cate distress." Likewise there is point in saying 
that " the gospel of Rousseau is translated by Cow- 
per into the gospel according to St. Paul," and in 
the statement that " whether Burke help us to under- 
stand the Revolution or not, assuredly the Revolu- 
tion should help us to understand Burke." Here is 
a very judicial estimate of Byron : " To acquire a 
right feeling for Byron and his poetry is a discipline 
in equity. It is easy to yield to a sense of his power, 
to the force and sweep of his genius ; it is easy to be 
repelled by his superficial insincerity, his license, his 
cynicism, his poverty of thought, his looseness of 
construction, his carelessness in execution." And 
there is food for ample reflection in such a passage 
as the following, which contrasts the Eastern heroes 
and heroines of Byron once so very much alive 
and now so completely dead with certain popular 
figures in recent works of fiction, such as Robert 
Elsmere and Dodo. " Perhaps Nora Helmer and 
Hedda Gabler may by and by repose in the old 
marionette box, and the wires by which their limbs 
are convulsed may have grown rusty ; perhaps the 
sawdust already escapes from a clerical garb that 
was so fresh a few years since ; perhaps a sprightly 
heroine of two or three seasons ago is no longer so 
atrociously sprightly." There is little in the main 
line of Professor Dowden's thought that will not 
find general critical acceptance, but we are some- 
what surprised to find him saying that " Shelley, 
unlike Wordsworth, and unlike Coleridge, was defi- 
cient in the power of original thought." Can one 



be so sure of that, when we consider how rare a 
thing " original thought " must always be? Strictly 
speaking, is there so very much of it in Wordsworth 
and Coleridge? And is it fair to say that Shelley 
does not produce the impression of a forceful 
thinker (setting aside as practically insoluble the 
question of originality) in almost as marked a de- 
gree as either of the others? He was less than 
thirty when he died, to be sure, while the others 
lived on into the time of ripeness, and this fact alone 
makes the comparison a trifle unfair ; but the real 
difficulty seems to be that some people find exact 
thought incompatible with melodious utterance. 
One gift should be enough for a poet, and the poet 
who presumes to think should remain rugged in his 
utterance. The same preconception has, in our own 
day, discredited the intellectual force of Mr. Swin- 
burne, and given rise to the curious notion that 
Browning was a more profound and exact thinker 
than Tennyson. _ 

Buddhism A- voluntary association of gentlemen 

sympathetically interested in the study of religions 
expounded. invited Professor Rhys Davids to 

deliver a series of lectures upon Buddhism, which 
have been printed in a neat volume of 230 pages, 
under the title, " Buddhism, Its History and Liter- 
ature" (Putnam). The keynote of the exposition 
is a thorough sympathy with the Buddhistic explana- 
tion of the universe and Buddha's panacea for all 
its woes. This fact, coupled with Professor Davids's 
ample and exact knowledge of his field, makes the 
contents of the book interesting and profitable read- 
ing. The treatment is somewhat too brief to be 
altogether satisfactory who could present Chris- 
tianity adequately in two hundred pages? But the 
writer has succeeded in putting forth with clearness 
and force his own conception of the salient features 
of this fascinating religious system. He is an 
advocate of the originality of Buddha in his psy- 
chological and ethical positions, and contrasts the 
traditionalism of the rest of the world, which is still 
bound in the fetters of the primitive " soul " theory. 
Of course, one does not look for criticism of Bud- 
dhism in these lectures, though they are, so far, it 
would seem, defective. How anyone can trace the 
history of Buddhism without a critical estimate of 
its defects is hard to understand. But Professor 
Davids successfully accomplishes even this. He is 
an optimist with respect to both the past and the 
future of Buddhism. 

Cooper is at his best in out-of-door 
stories. When, in an ill-advised hour, 
jje set himself to berating the Amer- 
ican people for their imperfections as judged by 
European standards, he was repaid with the outcry 
of disturbed complacency, an outcry which might be 
to-day translated, without losing force, into a crit- 
ical dictum against these damnatory works as litera- 
ture. Similar treatment has been accorded "Martin 
Chuzzlewit," and might well be extended to Mr. Kip- 
ling's " American Notes," both of which sketches of

American life lack that essential part of truth which 
lies in observing facts in their due proportion. And 
so some persons may question whether, after all, 
the reprinting of the " Autobiography of a Pocket- 
Handkerchief " (The Golden Booke Press, Evans- 
ton, 111.) is worth while. Certainly Mr. Walter Lee 
Brown has done his full duty in his laborious foot- 
notes of the variant readings found in the three 
printed forms of 1843 ; and corrected by compari- 
son with the original manuscript, fortunately at 
hand. It is evident from these foot-notes that 
Cooper was more painstaking in his revision than 
he is usually given credit for. It appears, however, 
that the first half of this volume was more carefully 
re-read than the somewhat slovenly and hurried 
remainder. One asks if there was a " period of 
French influence " in American letters at this time, 
for the characters affect French terms in their con- 
versation, and even the descriptive passages are be- 
spattered with French phrases. Yet the story is 
distinctly better than many amateur compositions 
or similar subjects, and, as the publishers say in 
their advertisement, here is an opportunity to com- 
plete your set of Cooper an opportunity never 
before offered by an American publisher. It is but 
just to add that the book is made attractive enough 
in appearance, and handsome enough in its heavy 
paper, to open the purse of any bibliophile suscep- 
tible to such blandishment. 



All by 
Mark Twain. 



The eight pieces in Mark Twain's 
"How to Tell a Story, and other 
Essays " (Harper) may be classified 
as follows : Two are professional recollections of a 
professional humorist ; two are appropriations, by 
the same humorist, of material which the literary 
critic has commonly thought of as his own property ; 
one is a seizing of that inestimable privilege of the 
humorist, the utterance of true wisdom ; one is a 
collection of material for the Society for the Pro- 
motion of Psychical Research ; two are subversions 
of the opinions of M. Paul Bourget and Mr. Max 
O'Rell. Of these, " Travelling with a Reformer " 
has long been sealed with the seal of universal ap- 
proval : the essay is a good thing, and a service to 
the American people. It is also very funny in 
places, as, indeed, are the other essays, though 
why " essays " it would be hard to say. The two 
rambles of the professional humorist are of course 
humorous, but they have so much professionalism 
about them as to be a trifle wearisome, at least to 
such as like to have a little spontaneity in life. The 
two invasions of literary territory, " In Defence of 
Harriet Shelley " and an indictment of James Feni- 
more Cooper, will suffer, we fear, from being found 
in company with the " Jumping Frog " and the 
" Golden Arm." They will not generally be regarded 
as contributions to critical literature, although the 
first, we think, holds the right ground, and the 
second says some very sensible things. The articles 
on Paul Bourget 's book throw light on what is 
already the most ancient of history, that of the day 



before yesterday. The examples of mental tele- 
pathy should be filed away for future reference and 
further information on the subject. Such are the 
separate parts of a book which is all by Mark Twain, 
a matter far more important than the particular 
facts just communicated. We hope that the author 
will soon offer us a companion volume entitled " How 
to Write an Essay, and other Stories." 



Evolution 
of the stars. 



Under the title, " Researches on the 
Evolution of Stellar Systems " (Nich- 
ols Press, Lynn, Mass.), Professor 
T. J. J. See, of the Lowell Astronomical Observa- 
tory, presents a compilation of researches valuable 
to the student of physical astronomy, but not to be 
recommended to the layman for seaside reading. 
Prefacing with a general account of double-star 
investigations " from Herschel to Burnham," and 
an acute mathematical discussion of the methods by 
which delicate observations are translated into de- 
lineations or orbits, Professor See has collated the 
observations, wherever made, upon forty binary 
stars, and presents the diagrams of their orbits. In 
each case, a star in the remote heavens, found to be 
separable into components only by telescopes of the 
finest definition when used by eyes of the acutest 
perception, has been by various persons separately 
observed, and the relative distances of the com- 
panion from its central sun have been determined, 
as well as its corresponding angular positions. 
These data, duly discussed and accurately platted, 
show that the companion moves in a planetary orbit 
about a masterful central body, and that the laws 
of gravitation, as discovered by Newton and form- 
ulated by Kepler, are dominant at those remote 
distances in the celestial universe as certainly as 
where the moon cycles its monthly circuit about the 
earth, and the planets weave their annual tracery 
upon the Zodiac. Conclusions of this sort produce 
the prof oundest impression upon the unprofessional 

reader. 

Professor Harold W. Johnston, of 
the University of Indiana, has done 
a very timely service to the cause of 
classical study by the preparation of a volume on 
"Latin Manuscripts" (Scott, Foresman & Co.). 
It is true that the pupils in our secondary schools, 
and even in our colleges, can come into contact 
with Latin literature only in printed editions, but 
many questions arise in the minds of such pupils as 
to the production and transmission of Latin books, 
and it is well that the answers to such questions 
should be put into accessible form. The subject is 
treated under three heads, the History of the Man- 
uscripts, the Science of Palaeography, and the 
Science of Criticism. The book is copiously illus- 
trated by reproductions of pages from famous 
manuscripts, among them the " Codex Romanus " 
of Catullus, which had lain hidden from the learned 
world under a mistaken classification in the Vatican 
Library, and was brought to light during the past 
year by Professor Hale of the University of Chi- 



Latin classict

cago. Perhaps the book would have been im- 
proved if a larger number of the critical processes 
described had been illustrated by concrete ex- 
amples ; but it is sufficiently plain to serve a good 
purpose in the hands of Latin teachers, and no such 
teacher should be without it unless he is provided 
with something more extensive in the same line. 



Literature 
of mutic. 



Although music was the first of the 
arts to possess a special dictionary 
of its own, no classification of the 
works most useful to the student in the principal 
departments of musical literature has been in ex- 
istence. This want has now been supplied by Mr. 
James E. Matthew in his work on " The Literature 
of Music " (Armstrong). The first five chapters 
of this work trace the principal objects with which 
musical literature occupied itself in the different 
countries of Europe down to the end of the eigh- 
teenth century. The remaining six chapters con- 
sider some of the special branches into which it has 
been directed, under the headings : Histories of 
Music, Dictionaries of Music, The Literature of 
Sacred Music, The Literature of the Opera, The 
Literature of Musical Instruments, The Literature 
of Music as a Science. Thus an inquirer in any 
one of these fields is furnished with an admirable 
guide showing how and where to go for the books 
which are of special interest and up-to-date, as well 
as those which are notable either for their curiosity, 
their scarceness, or for the important influence they 
have exercised in a past age. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The average buyer and reader of books, even when 
he imagines himself an ardent " book-lover," is too apt 
to be ignorant of the proper methods of handling and 
caring for his volumes. He will handle a book as he 
does his newspaper, and care for it as he might for a 
brick or a block of wood. In an attempt to dispel some 
of this ignorance, Mr. Arthur L. Humphreys, a member 
of the great London bookselling firm of " Hatchards," 
has written an excellent little volume entitled " The 
Private Library What we Do Know, What we Do n't 
Know, What we Ought to Know, about our Books " 
(London: Strange ways & Sons). In addition to much 
sound practical advice on the care and treatment of 
books, the arrangement of libraries, etc., Mr. Hum- 
phreys writes pleasantly on many such subjects as " Book 
Values," " The Art of Reading," " Old Country Libra- 
ries," " Book Hobbies," etc. In print, paper, and bind- 
ing, the volume should please the most fastidious. 

In " Cuba in War Time " (R. H. Russell), Mr. Richard 
Harding Davis expresses his contempt for the numerous 
" Cuban war-correspondents " so-called, who, while pop- 
ularly supposed to be in the midst of the fray on the 
island, are in reality turning out their " copy " from the 
security of Florida hotel piazzas. There are rumors 
afloat that Mr. Davis's own war sketches, contained in 
the present volume, were produced in this way ; but we 
think any impartial reader of his book will readily 
acquit him of the charge. Although nothing more than 



a collection of newspaper sketches, Mr. Davis's book is 
graphic and interesting, and from it may be gained a 
very good idea of the present condition of affairs on the 
ill-fated island. Mr. Frederic Remington, who accom- 
panied Mr. Davis on his trip to Cuba, contributes a 
number of illustrations to the volume, which, with a 
few exceptions, are sensational and poorly- drawn. 

In " The Aurora Borealis " (Appleton), M. Alfred 
Angot, of the Central Meteorological Office of France, 
gives a concise resume of the history of these always 
interesting and often strikingly beautiful phenomena, 
illusive and evanescent meteors of the upper air. Facts 
are stated and illustrated and explanatory theories are 
discussed. With most modern physicists, the author 
prefers that which recognizes in the aurora a mani- 
festation of electric energy, active in the upper atmos- 
phere and most frequently in polar latitudes, but ad- 
mits that much remains in this field to be explained or 
discovered. The volume closes with a list of all re- 
corded auroras since 1700. 

Mr. J. N. Lamed, editor of the successful " History 
for Ready Reference " and Public Librarian of Buffalo, 
has printed "A Talk about Books" (Peter Paul Book 
Co.) originally addressed to a body of high school stu- 
dents. It is pleasantly written and contains much sound 
and sensible advice about reading. It may be warmly 
recommended to the attention of young persons and their 
parents, being the same sort of thing, in spirit if not in 
eloquence, as Mr. Frederic Harrison's " The Choice of 
Books " and Mr. Ruskin's lecture " On King's Treas- 
uries." 

Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones, who some years ago pub- 
lished a pamphlet entitled "Ten Great Novels," the 
outcome of correspondence with a number of critical 
readers, has now sought to obtain a similar consensus of 
opinion in the field of poetry. " Ten Noble Poems " is 
the title of the pamphlet now issued, and it contains 
lists and explanatory letters from sixty-seven corre- 
spondents. The poems were to be measured by " the 
test of poetic form, ethical insight, and spiritual inspira- 
tion." Wordsworth's " Intimations " gets the largest 
vote, followed by " In Memoriam," " Saul," and Gray's 
"Elegy." No less than two hundred and thirty-eight 
poems are named altogether. The pamphlet makes very 
interesting reading. 

Professor Ralph S. Tarr publishes, through the 
Macmillan Co., a " First Book of Physical Geography," 
a treatise for still younger students than those for whom 
the author's " Elementary Physical Geography " was 
designed. This is the third text-book produced recently 
by Professor Tarr, and has the admirable qualities of 
clearness and strictly scientific method that characterize 
its predecessors. The illustrations are numerous and 
attractive, helping out the text in a highly satisfactory 
way. 

The Literary Year-Book " (Dodd), edited for 1897 
by Mr. F. G. Aflalo, is a venture of a new sort, and 
must be judged leniently. Its contents consist of liter- 
ary causeries, alternating with portraits and biographical 
sketches of writers who have recently come to the fore. 
This reading-matter is distinctly readable, although any- 
thing but profound. The reference features of the book 
include a literary calendar for the year, lists of public 
libraries and literary clubs in England, and very useful 
(although far from complete) directories of British 
authors, publishers, and booksellers. Altogether it is a 
useful compendium and one to be recommended to 
bookmen of all sorts.

LITERARY NOTES. 

Mr. E. W. Porter, of St. Paul, publishes a pretty text 
of FitzGerald's " Omar," with the various readings of 
the four editions. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish an " Elementary Arith- 
metic," by Mr. William W. Speer, Assistant Superin- 
tendent of the Chicago public schools. 

Two new volumes in the " Centenary " edition of Car- 
lyle have just been published by Messrs. Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons. They are two of the four which will contain 
the complete " Cromwell." 

It is said that Professor W. I. Knapp's long-expected 
life of George Borrow will be ready for publication in 
the Autumn. Dr. Knapp is probably the most learned 
of living Borrovians, and has traced the wanderings of 
his scholar-gypsy all over Spain. 

The doctoral dissertation of Miss Ellen C. Hinsdale, 
daughter of Professor B. A. Hinsdale of Ann Arbor, is 
entitled: " Ueber die Wiedergabe der Lateinischen 
Futurums bei den Althochdeutschen Uebersetzern des 
8.-10. Jahrhunderts." It is printed at Gottingen, at 
which university Miss Hinsdale took her degree. 

The Macmillan Co. have sent us Volume III. of 
Montaigne and Volume IV. of the " Morte d' Arthur " 
in their "Temple Classics," Heywood's "A Woman 
Killed with Kindness " in their " Temple Dramatists," 
" Lost Illusions " in their edition of Balzac, " Snarley- 
yow " in their collection of standard English novels, and 
" Dream Tales " in their edition of the novels of Tour- 
gue"nieff. 

The death of Mrs. Oliphant last month has been fol- 
lowed by the death, on July 20, of Miss Jean Ingelow, 
a woman whose poetical reputation was once consider- 
able, but seems to have declined of recent years, although 
a few of her pieces are still among the most generally 
familiar in the English language. Her several novels 
once had a considerable vogue but are now almost 
wholly forgotten. 

Several scholars in Japan are now making a special 
study of Dante. Among them is the Rev. Masahisa 
Uyemura, who is said to have under contemplation the 
composition of an essay on the great Italian poet. A 
society under the title of " Danate Kenkyukwai," an 
association for studying Dante's writings, is likely to be 
organized by the admirers of the poet. These interest- 
ing facts are furnished by the " Japan Times." 

It is with great pleasure that we note the unanimity 
with which all the periodicals that stand for an enlight- 
ened civilization have expressed their condemnation of 
the President's appointment of a new Librarian of Con- 
gress. Instead of selecting a professional librarian for 
this important post (assuming that Mr. Spofford was to 
be displaced) a politician with no qualification whatever 
for the work is chosen, presumably at the dictation of 
some local " boss." We did not expect that President 
McKinley would deal civil service reform such a slap in 
the face as this, and his protestations of friendship for 
the movement must hereafter be taken subject to a 
considerable discount. 

We are glad to state that the new tariff law of the 
United States, objectionable as it is in many of its fea- 
tures, does not embody the crowning atrocity of a tax 
upon all kinds of books. The provisions of the old law 
are substantially retained, leaving untaxed all books for 
public institutions, all books printed in foreign lan- 
guages, and all English books more than twenty years 



old. Even such a Congress as that now in office found 
itself unable to ignore the unanimous protest made by 
all who represent intelligent public opinion when the 
Dingley tax upon education was first bruited, and in this 
matter, at least, the law has not taken a step backward. 
The shameful tax upon art, however, has been made a 
part of the law, and refutes any idea that our latest 
tariff-makers could have had the interests of civilization 
really at heart. 

" The Century " for September will make the follow- 
ing announcement: 

" With the aim of encouraging literary activity among col- 
lege graduates, ' The Century Magazine ' offers to give, during 
four successive years, three prizes of $250, open to persons 
who receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts in any college or 
university in the United States during the commencement 
seasons of 1897, 1898, 1899, and 1900. 

" 1st, for the best metrical writing of not fewer than fifty 
lines. 2d, lor the best essay in the field of biography, history, 
or literary criticism, of not fewer than four thousand or more 
than eight thousand words. 3d, for the best story of not fewer 
than four thousand or more than eight thousand words. 

" On or before June 1st of the year succeeding graduation, 
competitors must submit type-written manuscript to the editor 
of ' The Century Magazine,' marked, outside and inside, ' For 
the College Competition,' signed by a pen-name, and accom- 
panied by the name and address of the author in a separate 
sealed envelope, which will not be opened until the decision 
has been made. It is to be understood that the article sub- 
mitted has not been previously published. The editor, at his 
discretion, may withhold the award in any class in case no 
manuscript is thought worthy of the prize. ' The Century 
Magazine ' reserves the right to print the prize manuscripts 
without further payments, the copyright to revert to the au- 
thors three months after the date of publication."

Just Out. A New Historical Novel by Mrs. BURTON HARRISON. 

A SON OF THE OLD DOMINION. 

Price, $1.50. 

"Mrs. Harrison has inhaled the very spirit of Virginian life in ante-Revolution days, and not so much penned it as 
exhaled it upon the pages of this delightful book. ... It is without question Mrs. Harrison's best work, and as a study in 
American historical literature, though of a later date, deserves a place by the side of Mr. Stimson's 'King Noanett.' " 
Boston Transcript. 
" We heartily recommend it to our readers as one of the best light historical stories recently published. It secures 
attention at once, and holds it firmly to the end : moves fast enough, yet turns aside into pleasant nooks of Old Dominion 
customs, religions, politics, and at the close leaves the reader better acquainted with an important period of American 
colonial history, and highly pleased with the outcome of the main thing, the sweet and pure love-story running all the way 
through the book, with a very captivating ripple of its own." New York Independent, 
" A novel that is well-nigh perfect in its minor details. . . . Mrs. Harrison has caught the spirit of the times right 
royally. . . . Her story is like some great painting that holds you spell-bound." Boston Herald.

KING NOANETT,

and the Massachusetts Bay. With twelve full-page illus- 
trations by HENRY SANDHAM, R.C.A. Bound in cloth, 
$2.00) : 
" Mr. Stimson's work is, in many ways, one of the best of its kind 
that has appeared since the publication of ' Lorna Doone ' itself, 
almost thirty years ago. Miles Courtenay and Jennife are admirably 
drawn, and the secret of the identity of the titular character, well 
kept until the very close of the tale, is one of the genuine surprises 
of fiction. King Noanett will live, as he deserves to live, long after 
many of his contemporary heroes of early adventure in this country 
are altogether forgotten. And his creator knows how to tell a story. "

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 
LITERATURE II. 

Mr. H. M. S. van Wickevoort Crommelin, 
in summarizing the literary activity of the 
twelvemonth in Holland, remarks that " some 
of our younger novelists are more struck by the 
problems which life offers than by their influ- 
ence on man. They attempt to analyze doubt, 
dejection, hereditary crime ; they show the wan- 
ing influence of moral and religious principles, 
and the great mass of superficial thinkers, of 
which the reading public largely consists, revels 
in this very modern work, which is recom- 
mended by its agreeable form." He instances 
in support of this thesis such books as Mr. 
Adema's " Wormstekigen," Miss Lohman's 
" Vragensmolde," Mr. van Doorne's "Twij- 
fel," and Mr. Coenen's " Een Zwakke." This 
last work, the gloomy and depressing tale of a 
cowardly suicide, is said to be " the last word 
of realism." To the question, " Will romanti- 
cism revive ? " the writer replies : " I have to 
chronicle two novels and one dramatic poem 
which are all but romantic." In " Drogon," by 
Mr. van Schendel, " we meet with the man who 
scorns worldly power, and whose ideal is to find 
the ' Ring of Jesus.' The wisdom this ring 
carries with it he hopes to impart to mankind." 
In " Irmenlo," by Mr. van Oordt, " the conflict 
between heathenism and Christendom in the 
Middle Ages is treated with singular dramatic 
power." The poem referred to is " Lioba," by 
Mr. van Eeden. The author " has with this 
work captivated once more the hearts of his 
countrymen. It marks a considerable advance 
in his artistic development, being much more 
truly poetical and less philosophical than his 
recent works. The influence of the great mas- 
ters, of Swinburne and Shakespeare, is unmis- 
takable ; the descriptions of nature are equal 
to those of our best modern poets, and in many 
parts the writer surpasses our great seventeenth 
century poet Vondel, of whom he often reminds 
us." On the whole, Dutch poetry keeps rather 
ahead of Flemish, and " the literary regenera- 
tion in the north has been followed by no equal 
movement on the part of our southern neigh- 
bors." Other works of fiction are " Jeanne Col-

lette," described as " a big anti-Semitic novel 
in two volumes," by Mr. Willem Paap; and 
" Metamorfose," a " dissection of a modern nov- 
elist," by Mr. Couperus, " whose delicate writ- 
ing is one of the features of to-day." The most 
important of learned works are Dr. van Deven- 
ter's " Hellenic Studies," and Professor Mul- 
ler's " Onze Gouden Eeuw " of Dutch history. 

Herr Leopold Katscher's article on Hungary 
begins with a long list of publications called 
forth by the millennial celebration. These 
include Mr. Szilagyi's " Millennial History of 
Hungary," Mr. Beothy's histories of Hungarian 
literature, Mr. Laurencic's " The Mellennium 
of Hungary and the National Exhibition," and 
Mr. Ferencczi's life of Petbfi. In fiction, Mr. 
Jokai has been silent, but Mr. Herczeg has pub- 
lished two volumes, " Szabolcs' Marriage," and 
" The First Swallow." There are also the " Sep- 
tember" of Mr. Ambrus, "our bitterest scep- 
tic," and books by Mr. Szomahazy, " one of the 
best among our lighter storytellers," Mr. Brody, 
"our leading realist," and Mr. Timar, "a 
young and able writer." As for poetry, Mr. 
Endrbdi's " Kurucz Songs " come first. " None 
of our poetry since Petbf i's has appealed to our 
patriotism with such force and perfection as this 
splendid production." There are young poets 
in Hungary as elsewhere, and among them are 
mentioned Baron Nikolics de Rudna, Mr. Fer- 
encz Martos, and Mr. Emil Makai. The most 
popular play of the year has been a translation 
of " Trilby " ! Scholarly publications include a 
history of Italian Literature by Mr. Antal 
Rado, a collection of essays by Mr. Diner- 
Denes, and an " Old Hungarian Library " of 
critical annotated texts, started under the edi- 
torship of Professor Gustav Heinrich. 

Signer Giuseppe Giacosa, writing of Italy, 
says that during the year " most of our greatest 
writers have either produced little or nothing, 
or published works not of a purely literary char- 
acter." Despite this fact, however, the article 
proves to be of considerable interest, and tempts 
to fuller illustration than we have space here 
to give. " In poetry, the influence of Carducci 
and d'Annunzio is less marked than formerly. 
Nor, notwithstanding the vogue of the French 
and Belgium symbolists, has the lily of mystical 
aspiration hitherto flourished among us. Faith- 
ful in this respect to its traditions, the lyric 
poetry of Italy has no affinity for the occult." 
Among volumes of new poetry may be men- 
tioned Signer Vitali's sonnets on the " Epopea 
del Risorgimento," Signer Rossi's " Ore Cam- 
pestri," and the "Nuovi Versi" of the late 



Contessa Lara. A very recent small volume 
of verse entitled " Madre," by Signer Cena, 
impels the writer to hail a new poet, and to say : 
" For some years past I have read no verses of 
such pure and continuous inspiration." 

" The novel is developing in two different directions 
under the influence of two powerful minds. D'Annun- 
zio has founded a school ; Fogazzaro has inspired, not 
disciples, but followers. The formal qualities of the 
first are, in part at least, of a kind easily acquired, while 
the intense inward fevour of the second attracts to him 
none but spirits already kindled. Both are idealists : 
Fogazzaro through his passion for the ideal, d'Annun- 
zio through the habit of idealization. Fogazzaro contem- 
plates life in its reality and complexity ; there is no 
person too insignificant, no action too trifling for him to 
regard it as material for art ; yet there breathes through- 
out every one of his writings a vivid transcendentalism, 
indicating that he yearns and strives after an unseen 
world after some supersensual good, D'Annunzio 
thinks nothing worthy of artistic treatment but himself, 
and himself not in as far as he resembles the rest of 
humanity, but in those points wherein he differs from 
them. By dint of collecting and refining with wonderful 
mastery his own sensations, and making of them, as it 
were, the pivot of the universe, he has attained to an 
idealized sensuality, a wantonness of the intellect, in 
which he places the quintessence of life and the nobility 
of human nature, as shown by his .recognizing in those 
so endowed the right of ruling over other men. D'An- 
nunzio will take a permanent place in our literary his- 
tory, but his literary influence will have benefited those 
only who admire him without wishing to take him as a 
model. It is a good thing to have noted in his verse and 
in his prose the capacity of the Italian language for 
renewed and genuine freshness and for the most inti- 
mate actuality, but only so far as it encourages every 
one to carry on for himself the task of linguistic puri- 
fication, seeking for himself at first hand, guided by his 
own inclinations and his own aims." 

The new works of fiction chiefly noted are " La 
Morte di Orfeo " and " Roberta," by Signor 
Zuccoli; " L'Incantesimo," by Signor Butti; 
" La Signorina X. di X," a philosophical novel 
published anonymously ; " La Prova," by Sig- 
nora di Luanto ; and " L'Arauleto," by the 
writer who signs herself " Neera." The " most 
interesting book of the year " is stated to be 
" L' Europa Giovane," by Signor Ferrero, the 
sociologist. In this book " he collects the im- 
pressions and observations gathered on a jour- 
ney through Europe, and especially during his 
stay at Berlin, London, and Moscow. Though 
not fond of diffuse word-painting, which, on 
the contrary, he avoids as far as possible, his 
delineation of things, actions, and people is clear 
and definite. Ferrero possesses in an eminent 
degree the artistic faculty of seizing on salient 
points, of marshalling them in brief and effec- 
tive sentences, and of embodying them in vivid 
images." Other works of a serious character 
are a continuation of the facsimile reproduc-

tion of Leonardo da Vinci's " Codex Atlanti- 
cus "; Dr. Ridella's " Una Sventura Postuma 
di Giacomo Leopardi," clearing the poet's 
memory from the calumnies of Ranieri ; the 
two volumes of the work entitled "Per Antonio 
llosmini nel Primo Centenario dalla Sua Nas- 
cita "; and Signor Negri's " Meditazioni Vaga- 
bonde," a volume of religio-philosophical es- 
says, which " treat metaphysics pretty much as 
Eenan treated the character of Christ." 

The Norwegian " books of the year " have, 
of course, been Dr. Nansen's account of his 
Arctic expedition and Dr. Ibsen's " John 
Gabriel Borkman." Herr C. Brinchmann, who 
is our annalist, takes these two books as too 
well known to need any description. Herr 
Bjornson has published nothing, but Herr Lie 
has produced " Dyre Rein," and Herr Garborg 
" Laeraren," both of these works being dis- 
tinctly problem-novels. Other fiction includes 
Herr Obstfelder's "Korset," Herr Krag's 
Ada Wilde," Herr Kinck's Sus," and Herr 
Tryggve Andersen's " I Kancelliraaden's 
Dage," " a grand historical novel." The re- 
mainder of this article is devoted chiefly to 
Dr. Bing's " Tider og Idealer," a treatise on 
French ideals in painting and literature ; a new 
edition of Wergeland, edited by his latest 
champion, Herr Naerup ; a new translation of 
Snorre Storlasson, the work of Professor Storm ; 
and a monograph on " Helge-Digtene i den 
^Eldre Edda," by Professor Sophus Bugge. 
" Following his revolutionary, and hence much- 
impugned, opinions on the origin of the Norse 
myths, he has also in this instance employed 
his vast learning to place the very core and 
centre of Northern heroic myths among the 
settlements of the Norsemen, surrounded by 
Kelts and Anglo-Saxons, in the British Isles." 

Contemporary Polish literature, for most 
readers outside of Poland, is summed up in the 
one name of Henryk Sienkiewicz. This name, 
however, does not occur in Professor Adam 
Belcikowski's summary of the year, but we have 
instead the unfamiliar names of Mr. Boleslaw 
Prus, author of "The Pharaoh," Mr. Przy- 
borowski, author of " The Knight Mora," Mr. 
Choinski, author of " The Last Romans," Mr. 
Gawalewicz, author of " Belonging to Nobody," 
and a long list of other writers with other works 
of fiction. The remainder of the paper is little 
more than a catalogue of the more noteworthy 
books of poetry, drama, history, and biography. 

The annals of literary Russia are told at 
great length by Mr. L. A. de Bogdanovitch, 
who mentions few names of which English 



readers have ever heard. Most contemporary 
literature in Russia sees the light in the monthly 
reviews, on account of the special conditions of 
the book-market and the risks involved in any 
more permanent form of publication. Among 
the few actual books described are the follow- 
ing : " The Russian Novel and Russian So- 
ciety," by Mr. K. Golovin ; some extremely 
pessimistic " Thoughts on the Essential Points 
of Public Activity," by Professor Kareieff ; 
and the " splendid " biography of A. S. Kho- 
miakoff, the theologian, by Mr. V. N. Lias- 
kovsky. Various novels, published as serials 
in the reviews, are discussed in the closing half 
of the paper. 

Spain is the last country in the "Athenaeum " 
list, since Sweden is for some unexplained rea- 
son ignored, and works in history and other 
departments of serious scholarship form, as in 
past years, the substance of the report. Don 
Rafael Altamira writes the article, and singles 
out the following three historical works as being 
of the greatest importance : The " History of 
the Social Institutions of Gothic Spain," by 
D. Eduardo Perez Pujol ; " The Despatches of 
the Pontificial Diplomatists in Spain," by D. 
Ricardo de Hinojosa ; and the second volume 
of the " Spanish Navy from the Union of the 
Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon," by Senor 
Fernandez Duro. Two works of great interest 
to the student of literature are thus described : 

" Senor Perez Pastor's ' Documentos Cervantinos 
hasta ahora IneMitos' contains more than fifty docu- 
ments, notes, various facsimiles, and an index of proper 
names. Some of the documents refer to the private 
life of Cervantes and his family, in particular his 
daughter, and others to the writings of the immortal 
author, from ' Don Quixote ' to ' Persiles and Sigis- 
munda.' All of them throw fresh light upon the biog- 
raphy of Cervantes and the bibliography of his writings, 
and although the critics may perhaps find matter for 
dispute in the significance and interpretation of some of 
the documents, there can be no doubt, generally speak- 
ing, of their historical value. . . . Quite as important 
as the volume of SeHor Pastor is that of Don Ramdn 
Mene*ndez Pidal, ' La Leyenda de los Infantes de Lara.' 
The writer studies this famous legend in the chansons de 
geste, in the ancient chronicles, in histories and ballads, 
in the drama, in modern poetry, finally in the folk-lore 
of to-day, paying special attention to the philological 
and critical examination of ancient documents." 

Senor Cotarelo's " D. Enrique de Villena : du 
Vida y Obras " and Senor Yxart's " El Arte 
Escenico en Espana " are two critical works of 
value. In fiction, the chief items chronicled 
are D. Juan Valera's " Genio y Figura," Senor 
Galdos's " Misericordia," and Senor Una- 
muno's "Paz en la Guerra," a story of the 
Carlist struggle in the north of Spain.

THE STUDY OP MAN AND OF 
CIVILIZATION.* 



" When the first edition of Katzel's VolJcer- 
Jcunde was published in 1885-8, it at once took 
its position as a guide book to the study of 
Man and Civilization." So says Mr. Tylor in 
his introduction to the translation of that work, 
which appears in English under the name " The 
History of Mankind." This translation is made 
by Mr. A. J. Butler, from the second German 
edition. The later edition differs somewhat in 
arrangement from the earlier, and is more con- 
densed, being in two volumes instead of three. 
Mr. Tylor's commendation is none too high ; 
every student is under real obligation to Pro- 
fessor Ratzel for his work. 

" The History of Mankind " is really a man- 
ual of general ethnography. It is a descrip- 
tion of peoples : a study not only of their phys- 
ical characters, but also and even more fully 
of their life and institutions. In many of 
his positions the author is a conservative. He 
emphasizes somewhat strongly the common 
humanity of all races, and minimizes racial dif- 
ferences. He appears to attribute much of phys- 
ical racial difference to difference in form of 
culture. He seems to consider all races capable 
of easily acquiring civilization if they are placed 
within reach of civilized life. In fact, he says : 
" The introduction of the so-called lower races into 
the circle of the higher civilization, and the overthrow 
of the barriers which once were raised high against such 
introduction, is not only a brilliant feat of humanity but 
at the same time an event of the deepest scientific inter- 
est. For the first time, millions of what was considered the 
lowest race the blacks have had all the ad vantages, all 
the rights and duties, of the highest civilization thrown 
open to them; nothing prevents them from employing 
all the means of self -formation which and herein lies 
the anthropological interest of the process will neces- 
sarily be transformation. If we could say to-day with 
approximate certainty what will become in the course of 
generations of the 12,000,000 of negro slaves who have 
within the last thirty years been freed in America, and 
who will, in the enjoyment of freedom and the most 
modern acquisitions of culture, have multiplied to 
100,000,000, we could with certainty answer the ques- 
tion as to the effect of culture upon race distinctions." 

And before the ink is dry on the page, Hoff- 
man's book appears, giving a searching analy- 
sis the first adequate study so far of the 
race traits and tendencies of the American 
negro. There are not to-day even 12,000,000

of them; there never will be 100,000,000. 
They are not being hopefully affected by our 
civilization, and it looks as if their last state 
might be worse than their first. As for the 
distant future what is their outlook ? Is it 
not extinction ? And why ? Because they are 
negroes, and race traits are terribly strong. 
Ratzel's position is always one of happy optim- 
ism, curiously blind to the reality and pro- 
fundity of race unlikeness. Of course all men 
are human ; of course human brains everywhere 
and always are capable of great achievement. 
We believe that the apparently simple inven- 
tions of early man were as great victories of the 
intellect as are our complex inventions of to-day. 
But to give a white man's civilization to the negro, 
and to have him assimilate it, is no easy task. 
Many generations of time and constant action of 
many influences changing the whole man phy- 
sical, mental, moral are necessary. And dur- 
ing the experiment the lower race is like to die. 
Ratzel's work as it now appears is handsomely 
printed and illustrated. The illustrations are 
chiefly portraits of peoples made from direct 
photographs and pictures of museum speci- 
mens ; while not always exactly fitting the text, 
they are interesting and instructive. There are 
nine colored plates, which show groups of na- 
tives, habitations, or carefully arranged masses 
of their art products. The work is divided into 
" books," of which the first and part of the 
second are contained in the first volume. 
Book I. in 144 pages, presents the " Principles 
of Ethnography." In thirteen chapters it 
sketches the field and makes a comparative 
study of human achievements and institutions. 
How civilization rises and spreads, and some of 
the elements of culture, are discussed. This 
book issued separately would make a good text 
in ethnography for class use. It shows, as no 
other book in our language, the value of ethno- 
graphic specimens and the mode of using them 
in study. The author believes in migration of 
arts and borrowing between tribes. Two sets 
of opinions are urged at present in this matter. 
The one claims that the finding of a given art 
or object, just the same among widely separated 
peoples, proves contact and mutual influence 
between these in the past, or community of 
descent. The other asserts that mankind is 
psychically a unit, and that everywhere, given 
a certain need or certain conditions, men widely 
sundered will independently invent the same 
things and think the same thoughts. As a con- 
crete illustration, some authors find the begin- 
nings at least of native American art in some 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



other district, and look upon it as an importa- 
tion ; others find nothing here that suggests a 
foreign origin, and assert that North American 
art has grown up here from the beginning. 
Our author is one of the former class. He 
believes that the geographical distribution of 
an art, of a decorative style, of a peculiar belief 
or custom, is often a means of tracing relation- 
ships and contact between peoples and of fol- 
lowing lines of migration. Just at the present 
in our country the contrary view is carried to 
an astonishing extreme ; the principle is a good 
one, but may be easily carried too far. Ratzel's 
book is then particularly important here at this 
time. While a whole culture may not be readily 
assimilated by a race far below those to whom 
it belongs, elements of arts and industries may 
easily be borrowed and are sure to be carried to 
new homes by tribes in migration. 

The second part of this volume is devoted to 
the American Pacific Group of Races. Three 
clusters of peoples are studied the races of 
Oceania, the Australians, the Malays and 
Malagasies. In the study of these, the same 
course practically is pursued for each. The 
physical geography of the area occupied is ex- 
amined, the flora and fauna are described in 
their human relationships, and the races them- 
selves characterized. Then follow descriptions 
of the houses, dress, weapons, and other belong- 
ings, the mode of life, the social structure, the 
government, the religion. The mass of ma- 
terial presented is enormous, and it is extremely 
condensed. It is not easy reading, but is care- 
fully put and of great importance. The work 
deserves a great success in America, both among 
special students and more general readers.

AMERICAN LITERATURE.* 



Two books about American literature, quite 
different but each very good in its way, are evi- 
dence that America has produced a literature 
that is more than an echo of English literature, 
since it is filled with American scenery, Amer- 
ican thought, American character, and that this 
literature is well worthy of consideration. 

Our old friend Donald G. Mitchell talks 
about this literature in his book entitled "Amer- 
ican Lands and Letters "; and when he talks,

who does not love to listen ? Indeed, no one 
with less gifts as a raconteur could hope to take 
a period seemingly so barren for letters as that 
which began with the arrival of the "May- 
flower" and ended with Irving's "Rip Van 
Winkle," and make a book of four hundred 
pages without a dull line in it. What he says 
of Benjamin Franklin and his " Poor Richard " 
sayings may with truth be applied to himself : 
" Whoever can put new force and new beauty into an 
old truth by his method of re-stating it, is doing good 
work doing indeed what most of the good sermonizers 
are bent upon. No matter what old metal you may use, 
if you can put enough of your own powder behind it 
't will reach the mark." 

Only those authors whose birth-date falls 
before the beginning of the present century are 
included in this survey, the three names of 
principal importance being Cooper, Irving, and 
Bryant. Of all these, Mr. Mitchell can speak 
from personal friendship, or at least acquain- 
tance, and the touches of personal reminiscence 
are very happy. It makes us realize how near 
our past really is when we read our author's 
personal recollections of the memorial meeting 
at the death of James Fenimore Cooper, a meet- 
ing which was called to order by Washington 
Irving and presided over by Daniel Webster, 
and where eulogistic speeches were made by 
Bancroft and Bryant. 

Mr. Mitchell's characterization of Cooper's 
powers and limitations may be cited as an ex- 
ample of the happy art with which he can put 
a bit of sound criticism in a taking form. 

" There are writers to whom the details are every- 
thing; and to whom elaborate finish, happy turns of 
expression, illustrative streaks of humor, give largest 
value and most consequence. With Cooper 't is far 
otherwise; there's little finish, there's no humor; no 
ingenious turn of a sentence or a thought brings yon to 
pause either to weigh it or enjoy it. He is making 
his way to some dramatic end by bold, broad dashes of 
descriptive color, which he may multiply or vary with 
tedious divergencies, without spoiling his main chance. 
Hence there is no American author, scarce any popular 
author, who loses so little by translation. The charm 
that lies in light, graceful play of language about trifles 
is unknown to him." 

As the guest of Washington Irving at Sunny- 
side, Mr. Mitchell has visited Sleepy Hollow, 
the creator of " Rip" and " Ichabod Crane " 
pointing out the exact route of the memorable 
night-ride of a certain headless horseman, and 
dwelling with roguish delight on his own boyish 
escapades in the region afterwards made famous 
by his pen. Irving was doubtless the best loved 
by his contemporaries of any of this early group. 
He was not one of those strenuous souls who 
delve new channels for thought ; but his charac-

ter was so clean, his language so full of grace, his 
sympathies so true and noble, his humor so genu- 
ine and abiding, that his books beam with a kind- 
liness that should not and will not be forgotten. 
The illustrations in Mr. Mitchell's book are 
of great value, including pictures taken from 
rare portraits or engravings, facsimiles of old 
manuscripts or fragments of scarce books, maps, 
and a chronological chart showing the sequence 
of events having relation to development of 
American lands and letters. Like the three 
volumes of "English Lands, Letters, and 
Kings " previously published, this book and its 
probable successor bringing the story into the 
present time, may be commended especially for 
young persons as a stimulus to further study. 

Professor Painter's " Introduction to Amer- 
ican Literature " begins with John Smith and 
includes the present day. The classification is 
into five periods : First Colonial, Second Colo- 
nial, Revolutionary, First National, and Second 
National. Quite properly, the " First National " 
period occupies the principal space, including 
as it does all of our greatest names Emerson, 
Hawthorne, Longfellow, Lowell, Whittier, 
Holmes. It would be difficult to better, in an 
equal number of pages, the characterizations of 
these men, and their respective parts in the life 
of the times are well differentiated. The Tran- 
scendental movement, the founding of the 
"Atlantic Monthly," the formation of the 
Saturday Club, the publication of " The Dial," 
the Brook Farm experiment, are all given a 
place, but no more than their due place, as fac- 
tors in the evolution of American thought and 
letters. The book, though primarily designed 
for the use of schools, has a critical value and 
a largeness of treatment entitling it to a wider 
audience. ANNA B. McMAHAN. 



THE FIRST ANNOTATION OF CARLYI/E'S 
MOST CHARACTERISTIC WORK.* 

In the sixty-three years that have passed 
since Carlyle's most characteristic book was 
reluctantly admitted in instalments to the pages 
of " Eraser's Magazine," this " prose poem " 
has steadily grown in importance, until now it 
marks, perhaps better than any other single 
work, the transition in English thought from 
the sense-philosophy of Locke to the faith in 
spiritual realities that followed in due time. 
At last a worthy annotated edition of " Sartor 



*SABTOK RESARTUS. Edited by Archibald MacMechan, 
Professor in Dalhoosie College. ( Athen;eum Press Series.) 
Boston : Ginn & Co. 



Resartus " has appeared, and Professor Mac- 
Mechan, the editor, is to be congratulated upon 
the industry, sympathy, and erudition with 
which his task has been accomplished. Of the 
four sources of the original work, copious ex- 
tracts from Carlyle's journal are here given in 
the notes, revealing a surprising fidelity of 
transcription in the process by which the au- 
thor thus turned the product of his private 
meditation to account. The use made, too, of 
his unfinished novel, " Wotton Reinfred," is 
striking in its ready adaptation, sometimes with 
very slight changes, to the new purpose in hand. 
As to the parallelism discovered between " Sar- 
tor " and on the one hand the earlier essays, as 
well as on the other the translations from the 
German, there is doubtless room for some 
further work to be done, although the editor 
has also tilled this field faithfully. The inter- 
esting query, " Who was Blumine ? " is an- 
swered with a triple reference to Margaret 
Gordon, Catherine Fitzpatrick, and Jane 
Welsh, with convincing data in each case, leav- 
ing the reader in agreement with the editor that 
the " flower goddess " is a composite portrait. 
But why should not the same liberal view 
prevail touching Carlyle's style ? In general, 
the editorial analysis at this point is distinctly 
a service ; yet there is an apparent jealousy for 
the author's originality that will not suffer ad- 
mission of any palpable degree of indebtedness 
to the Germans, and in particular to Richter. 
It is declared that Carlylese is the product of 
early years at home, showing itself in letters 
antedating German influence. There is not 
space for an extended argument upon this dis- 
puted question, but a few facts may be stated 
and left to show their own bearing. Professor 
MacMechan regards the use of Germanisms as 
artfully designed to give the book an atmos- 
phere. But the earlier essays also are dotted 
with capitalized nouns, and show a gradual 
approach from an ordinary style to that with 
which later readers are familiar. Also, when 
the translation of " Wilhelm Meister " ap- 
peared, it was blamed for its too frequent Ger- 
manisms, a fault that received censure again on 
the appearance of the specimens of German Ro- 
mance. Moreover, there is at least an attempt 
in " Sartor " to write in two different styles, 
that of the professor and that of the editor. 
That of the former, by a singular coincidence, 
is characterized by Carlyle in almost the same 
language as he had formerly employed in de- 
scribing the eccentricity of Richter's literary 
manner. Which of the two styles is Carlyle's

own ? Both are his, in so far as he is unsuc- 
cessful in differentiating the two. He confesses 
such failure by repeatedly using the device of 
apology, because the editorial style has been 
contaminated by contact with the professional 
metaphor and crabbedness. Is not the truth, 
in this instance as in the case of Blumine, that 
Carlylese is a composite product, the result of 
a tendency plus an influence ? 

The Notes contain many grateful rays of 
light, from a variety of sources. It is here, if 
anywhere, that the results of collaboration are 
manifest. Many recondite allusions are satis- 
factorily traced to the fountain-head, while 
many other quotations are given that are chiefly 
illustrative of the similar products that the 
time-spirit may evoke from different men. 
About a dozen hard nuts are left uncracked, to 
tempt the teeth of future editors. The indebt- 
edness of Carlyle to the Bible and to Shake- 
speare appears, to the degree of the assimilation 
of these two books into the very flesh and bone 
of his diction. The long passage, afterward 
suppressed, from the first edition of " Pelham," 
shows on how firm a basis of fact rests the pro- 
fessorial satire against the luckless dandiacal 
body. But was there any need, one asks, for 
striving to identify the alleged defect in the 
Latinity of the famous Swiftian epitaph, a de- 
fect alleged as excuse for not carving these 
muddy sentences upon the Zahdarm tombstone? 

The only serious omission from the body of 
editorial contribution is an apt discussion of the 
place held historically by " Sartor " in the devel- 
opment of English thought. There are hints 
of such relations, here and there ; but it would 
seem that a work of so great significance should 
be accompanied by some formal account of the 
larger causes and conditions out of which it 
grew. The fact still remains that the first anno- 
tated edition of Carlyle's most original work is 
a valuable aid to the study of nineteenth-century 
literature. D. L. MAULSBY. 



MURRAY'S HISTORY OF GREEK 
LITERATURE.* 



A history of Greek literature, well written, 
concise yet full enough to give the reader an 
appreciative sense of its spirit and form, would 
be a real boon. Of this not too high ideal, the 
volume before us falls short. The book might 
more properly be called a critique than a his-

Murray, Professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow.

tory of Greek literature. The writer has mani- 
festly a close and large acquaintance with his 
subject, and a just appreciation of many ele- 
ments of Greek life and thought. But some- 
how he fails to give that account of the litera- 
ture of the ancient Hellenes, and that insight 
into the forces and ideas that made it what it 
was and still is, that we have a right to expect 
from an historian. 

After reading the first chapter, which treats 
of Homer, one must still ask what are the char- 
acteristic features of the Greek epic, and what 
is Homer as literature ? A good deal that is 
instructive is said about the Homeric Question, 
but one not familiar with the discussion would 
hardly get a distinct idea of the chief theories 
and points at issue. 

With Professor Murray's characterization of 
Pindar, the admirers of the " Theban Eagle " 
are likely to find fault, and the opinion of the 
rest is not worth considering. 

The chapter on Herodotus, while giving a just 
estimate of the scope and credibility of the his- 
tory, fails to do justice to the style and diction 
of this delightful story-teller. 

In the chapter on ^Eschylus, the author 
speaks of Thespis' own deme Icaria as being 
near to Eleusis, evidently in ignorance of the 
brilliant discovery of the true location of this 
deme by the late Professor Merriam. It is 
rather a novel view to hold that JEschylus is in 
religious thought generally the precursor of 
Euripides. The chapters on Sophocles and 
Euripides are perhaps the most satisfactory of 
the book, though both writers are not closely 
enough related to the trend and tendencies of 
their own times. 

In spite of the caveat in the Preface, Aris- 
totle's rank and influence as a writer entitle 
him to more space than is allowed. 

There is plenty of fine writing in the book ; 
occasionally, indeed, there is an attempt at 
" smartness." No one will find it dull reading. 
But, as was said at the outset, the layman still 
needs a clear, objective, reasonably complete 
outline of the history of Greek literature within 
the compass of a single octavo volume.

MONOGRAPHS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.* 

The facility and economy of modern printing 
have made possible the preservation of all worthy 
results of investigation in every field of human ac- 
tivity. Formerly, the fruit of perhaps years of study 
and patient inquiry was embodied in a "thesis," 
which, after presentation and as careful reading as 
the penmanship would allow, was carefully filed 
away in some dusty drawer as a counterweight in 
the balance against the diploma which was issued 
upon its authority. At the present day, the " thesis " 
is presented ready for the printer, and, indeed, fre- 
quently comes to the examiner in the desirable form 
of print. Thus issued, it is ready for exchange and 
for general distribution, carrying its information or 
message to the bounds of the reading world. Nor, 
indeed, is such publication confined to the student 
body. The modern teacher feels the pressure from 
a class larger than the one within his classroom ; he 
responds to the demand for the utilization of his 
time, aside from teaching, in investigation and sum- 
ming of results. In addition to these classes of 
contributors, professional men who find the ardor of 
student days returning to them give the benefits of 
their trained powers of examination to some subject, 
often in close touch with the teacher, and finally 
entrusting to the medium of the university the pub- 
lication of the results. 

In this way has grown up the present extensive 
system of monograph publication through regularly 
established channels. No university can now afford 
to be without its " Studies " or " Annals." So rapidly 
these accumulate and so far they extend that one 
may picture the future investigator buried, like the 
maiden of old, beneath a mass of treasure, or imagine 
him lamenting the preemption of the last bit of un- 
occupied ground. Many of these efforts show the 
cramped hand of the student ; many of the conclu- 
sions reached exhibit the callowness of youthful 
minds ; the larger number of them would be much 
improved by being allowed to ripen in the sun of a 
few post-doctorate years. But as " contributions to 
knowledge," as sometimes being the fruit of ma-

ture judgment, and as frequently clearing the ground 
for subsequent work, they are worthy of a promi- 
nent place in the literature of their respective sub- 
jects. 

The field of American History, with the adjacent 
grounds of Political Science, has been occupied 
with publications which compare favorably with 
other subjects both in number and quality. The 
materials are to be found on every hand, the sub- 
ject is inviting, and in probably no people of the 
world will the history of its growth and develop- 
ment be so fully described as in our own. 

Harvard University, under the skilled direction 
of Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, began several 
years since a series of studies in History and Polit- 
ical Science which were described at the time in 
THE DIAL. He has recently revived the plan under 
the certainty of the Henry Warren Torrey fund. 
The four numbers issued, bearing the title " Har- 
vard Historical Studies," are the largest and most 
scholarly set of monographs given out by any insti- 
tution. The first is from the pen of a negro, Mr. 
William E. Burghardt DuBois, of Massachusetts, 
now conducting a special investigation into the con- 
dition of the negro people of Philadelphia, under the 
direction of the University of Pennsylvania. He 
presents a history of the " Suppression of the African 
Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638- 
1870," with copious references, an exhaustive chron- 
ological conspectus of slave-trade legislation, and a 
very full bibliography. 

The second volume of the series, " The Contest 
over the Ratification of the Federal Constitution in 
the State of Massachusetts," by Professor Samuel 
B. Harding of the Indiana University, is in line 
with the many recent investigations into the birth- 
years of American political parties. The frequently 
discussed attitude of Hancock toward the Constitu- 
tion is here shown to be that of a politician who 
lends his influence for the sake of being supported 
as a possible candidate for the presidency or the 
vice-presidency. Samuel Adams is described as also 
wishing to make some political popularity out of the 
struggle. Such revelations, together with the de- 
scription of the haste of these patriots to be favor- 
able to the new instrument when the Boston 
mechanics had declared for it, must prove an icono- 
clastic shock to the old style eulogistic conception of 
our political fathers and bring nearer the day when 
we shall study our men of affairs as they were. 

The third volume, " A Study of Nullification in 
South Carolina," by Professor David F. Houston of 
the University of Texas, is devoted largely to refut- 
ing the statement in Draper's " Civil War " that 
Calhoun fostered and led the Nullification movement 
of 1828-32. The economic and political changes 
occurring soon after 1820, and the consciousness of 
the coming danger to slavery, produced a revulsion 
and a discontent in the people which Calhoun simply 
followed. The author finds no direct, and but two 
indirect, results of the Nullification agitation : a 
deepened conviction of the conflict of interest be-

THE DIAL 



tween the North and the South, and a hastening to 
the belief that secession was the only remedy left 
for the state against the Federal government. The 
investigation has been broad, the results are clearly 
stated, but the collocation is rather desultory. 

The fourth volume of the series, on " Nominations 
for Elective Office in the United States," departs 
from the purely historical ground which the preced- 
ing numbers assume. It comes from the hand of 
a scholar who has had later training in the practical 
aspect of the subject under consideration. Mr. Dai- 
linger has served as a member of the Massachusetts 
Senate, and his opinion upon the growth of nomina- 
ting machinery in the United States, its present 
status, its defects, and especially upon the remedies 
to be applied to existing evils, will be worthy of a 
hearing even from those who complain that the ordi- 
nary " studies " of the seminar are remote from the 
bounds of practicability. " Three reforms " says 
Mr. Dallinger, "are urgently needed: a diminution 
in the number of elective offices ; the absolute sep- 
aration of national and State politics from local 
affairs; and above all, the radication of the spoils 
system in the public service, and the consequent de- 
struction of the class of professional politicians." In 
connection with the sketch of the growth of the nom- 
inating system, Mr. Dallinger gives a number of re- 
productions of ballots, blanks, etc., which are most 
interesting and commonly inaccessible. 

A recent number of the " Columbia University 
Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law " 
deals with " The Struggle between President John- 
son and Congress over Reconstruction." In follow- 
ing the well-known lines of "The Congressional 
Globe," this monograph furnishes a fresh illustra- 
tion of the difficulty in making a broad estimate of 
an event so recent as Reconstruction. When occur- 
rences fresh from the mould of time shall be allowed 
to cool, and additional evidence be brought from 
reserved papers and material added from private 
resources, a clearer crystallization of facts may re- 
sult. The author finds it "a fortunate thing for the 
country that the attempt [to convict Johnson] failed." 
Lincoln had been sustained in his assumption of 
powers ; but, with Johnson in the chair, Congress 
determined to resume its powers. In the violence 
of the reaction with which the country responded, 
the pendulum went too far and "our institutions 
were in greater danger than they were before. But 
just as the Civil War had settled the question as 
to the indissolubility of the Union, so no less em- 
phatically did the failure of the impeachment trial 
confirm the equality of the three departments of our 
government." 

The tobacco industry of Virginia was so intimately 
connected with the slavery question before 1860 that 
it was an object of frequent and comprehensive 
study. Its later development and present conditions 
form the subject of a monograph by Professor 
B. W. Arnold, Jr., published in the series of " Johns 
Hopkins Studies." Although the tobacco industry 
declined immediately after the close of the Civil 



War, owing to the necessary diversion of labor to 
food-producing crops, the loss of slave labor, the rise 
of competing manufactures and the growth of urban 
population, yet in 1894 the state added over two 
and a half millions of dollars to the internal revenue, 
and " the finest residences, hotels, chambers of com- 
merce, educational institutions and public buildings 
have, for the most part, been built by profits from 
tobacco." The conclusion reached in the paper is 
that only fine tobacco will repay the cultivator, that 
the farmer must be educated to more skilful pro- 
duction, and that the evils of unrestricted competi- 
tion seem quite as pernicious as those of trusts. 

Rather remote from the intensive studies of the 
universities is a set of monographs most daintily 
gotten up by the Preston & Rounds Co., of Provi- 
dence, R. I. This Rhode Island series treats of the 
early colonial history of that state, the last number 
being the life of the pious Samuell Gorton, the first 
settler of Warwick, who rejoiced in bestowing upon 
his daughter the remarkable Scriptural name of 
Mahershallalhashbaz, and contested all his life for 
the privilege of independent thought.

upon his own terms. Judged by any of the tests 
ordinarily applied to works of fiction, his three

have no organic structure, and lack even coherency. 
Their style exhibits a garrulous disregard of the

in any true sense is like expecting figs of thistles. 
And yet their charm is undeniable, whatever their 
technical shortcomings, and we cannot help wonder-

for a score of years. " The Martian " is a rather 
more harum-scarum performance than either of its 
predecessors. The hypnotic nonsense of " Trilby " 
was had enough, in all conscience, hut the astral 
influence nonsense of the new novel is even more 
pitifully puerile. The story is made up of tags, 
reminiscent and reflective, and only the fact that 
they come from a genial mind and a warm heart, 
and that somehow they produce in their scrappy 
way the impression of superabundant life, do they 
save the hook from inanity and encourage the reader 
to persevere to the end. The first chapters of the 
hook are much the best, and, taken by themselves as 
a picture of French schoolboy life half a century 
ago, they are a fitting pendant to the story of Tom 
Brown at Rugby. The famous construction of 
" triste lupus," for example, is at least equalled by 
the achievement of the youth who makes " J'estime 
les Danois et leurs dents de fer " out of " Timeo 
Danaos." We are sorry when Barty leaves school, 
for he becomes far less interesting, and the people 
with whom he associates bore us not a little. Of 
course the book is attractive in spots throughout, 
made bright by sparkling bubbles of humor and 
serious by touches of poignant pathos, but in spite 
of these things it drags undeniably especially from 
the time when Martia begins to get in her uncanny 
work just as " Trilby " drags after the ill-advised 
introduction of the hypnotic motive. " The Mar- 
tian " will doubtless have many readers, just as 
" Trilby " had them, but we cannot predict for it 
any measure of enduring fame, however brilliantly 
the author's talent flashes out here and there. 

When a writer starts out to cultivate a Mere- 
dithian style he should at least be equipped with an 
elementary knowledge of English syntax. Mr. J. C. 
Snaith, to whom this observation refers, mars what 
would otherwise be a good piece of work by the 
grossest of solecisms. He repeatedly uses " like " 
as a conjunction, and is so enamored of split infini- 
tives that he seems to go out of his way to make 
them. As for the Meredithian quality of his style, 
an extract may serve as illustration. " Softly, softly ! 
she twisted the knob within her cunning palm, she 
made no sound, she let no faint creak arise, but 
there it was unlatched with a secrecy excelling 
feline. Now she jammed one taut finger-tip against 
the panel's face, applied the most expert nicety of 
pressure, and the door opened one-eighth of an inch, 
nor made no sound. A thread of lamplight curled 
out and made love to her sparkling face. It ad- 
mired her nostrils most, it saw the throb of battle 
in them. Success was now piping to her blood ; it 
swelled on the martial song and incited her eyes to 
flash rebellion." Not a bad imitation, surely, and 
" Fierceheart the Soldier " is written throughout in 
this sort of English. It purports to be a romance 
of the Forty-five, and it really is concerned in a way 
with the events from Prestoupans to Culloden. But 
its chief interest is domestic, and lies in its extremely 
strong and subtle characterization of some half- 
dozen persons. Fierceheart himself is a character 



not unlike the Nelson of history and the Volodyovski 
of fiction, a brave soldier and an exceeding fop, 
equally concerned with love of country and the curl- 
ing of his wig, and inexorable when some point of 
honor is in question. And he is only one of the 
several strong and vital figures by which this book 
is made something distinctly out of the common. 

In Dr. Doyle's recent novels we look in vain for 
the qualities that won for "Micah Clarke" and 
" The White Company " such deserved admiration. 
In " Uncle Bernac," the latest of these productions, 
there is a fair degree of interest and a certain vigor 
of handling, but one would never think of reading 
the book a second time. The story is of Napoleon 
at Boulogne, about to set out for the conquest of 
England, and is concerned chiefly with the adven- 
tures of the son of a French refugee royalist, who 
returns to France to offer his sword to the Emperor. 
The figure of Napoleon is sketched in a theatrical, 
" Madame Bejane " sort of fashion, and one gets 
from it no impression of vitality. It portrays a few 
of the man's humors, but not the man himself. The 
whole narrative, in fact, is sketchy, written currents 
calamo, and hurried to a tame conclusion. 

" Middle Greyness " is a novel whose scenes are 
laid alternately in Australia and in England. It 
tells of a man who has make a wreck of his own 
life (although we are not told just how), and who 
relinquishes his two sons to a wealthy relative, who 
agrees to provide for them on condition that the 
father shall disappear completely. So the father 
takes to the Bush and the sons are sent to the Uni- 
versity. How the father, despite his agreement, 
does come into the lives of his sons, unknown to 
them, and how the latter go their several ways 
the one to degradation and the other to fame is 
set forth with much prolixity. The father, con- 
scious of " the black streak " in his own character, 
hopes to find it subdued to " middle greyness " in 
the characters of his sons. This is the explanation 
of the title, and it must be said that the author harps 
upon these and some other favorite phrases with 
undue persistence. The book is not very well writ- 
ten, and its best passages are those which relate to 
Australia. Here we have pages of description which 
fairly glow with color, and which are filled with 
what may be called the passion of the Bush. On 
the whole, the book is not a strong one, although it 
has flashes of genuine power. Similar characteristics 
must be ascribed to the collection of a dozen sketches 
that the author of " Middle Greyness " has brought 
into a volume entitled " Mere Sentiment." Some of 
these, also, are Australian in theme, and all of them 
lie rather without the usual rut of the teller of 
stories. They are not very carefully worked out, 
and are brought to somewhat abrupt conclusions. 

Mr. A. E. W. Mason's thrilling story of " The 
Courtship of Morrice Buckler " gave us a taste for 
its author which is hardly satisfied by his new book, 
" The Philanderers." He is better at intrigue and 
adventure than in the analysis of character which he 
attempts in the present work, and the reader feels

but a languid interest in his London society figures 
the fickle maiden who adds conquest to conquest, 
the vain and petty litterateur, and even the late 
leader of an African expedition, now turned pro- 
moter and busied with the floating of a new enter- 
prise. We should have liked him better had he 
remained in Africa where the beginning of the story 
finds him. 

"Mr. Peters" is a novel that begins with a 
lynching-bee in Western America, and ends by drop- 
ping the hero into the sea at Leith. This hero is a 
gentleman of Swiss-Italian extraction, the son of the 
innocent victim of the lynchers, and a child at the 
time of the fatal occurrence. When he grows up, 
his one object in life is to track the two men who 
were chiefly responsible for the tragedy, and to 
avenge upon them his father's death. The scene is 
mostly laid in Edinburgh, to which the two men find 
their way, and the tedium of the motive above out- 
lined is relieved by the introduction of a number of 
minor characters none of whom turn out very inter- 
esting. The book has some touches of grim humor 
and a few fairly animated scenes, but it undoubt- 
edly drags in many places, and the general effect is 
one of incoherency. Nearly every one of the char- 
acters is blurred in the delineation, and we search 
in vain for some clean-cut and vividly-conceived 
figure with an unmistakable personality of its own. 
On the whole, one is glad when the victims of Mr. 
Peters are out of the way and he himself is drowned, 
for he might have gone on fumbling indefinitely with 
his ineffectual plans for revenge. 

Mr. Gilbert Parker's work is always carefully 
conceived and elaborated with much artistic finish. 
He has recently added two books to his lengthening 
list. One of them, " The Pomp of the Lavilettes," 
is the story of a French Canadian village at the time 
of Papineau's abortive rebellion (1837-8). It is a 
strong piece of work, dramatic and stirring, per- 
haps not quite as good as " Valmoml," but holding 
the attention absorbed in the fortunes of its leading 
characters, and brought to a finely tragic ending. 
"A Romany of the Snows," Mr. Parker's other 
new book, is a volume of nine short stories, in many 
of which our old friend Pierre figures. It has the 
crisp atmosphere of the Northern wilderness, the 
mystery and the romance of life among a simple 
people who live close to nature, and are none the 
worse for being without the trappings of a sophis- 
ticated civilization. 

Some months ago our readers were informed of 
the fund of entertainment awaiting them in Mr. 
Louis Tracy's " The Final War." No less auda- 
cious in conception, and fully as beguiling for an 
idle day, is Mr. Tracy's new romance of " An Amer- 
ican Emperor." Just why the book should be fur- 
ther styled "A Story of the Fourth Empire of 
France " is not altogether clear, and we fear that 
the author has got the two historical empires mixed 
up with the three republics. Be that as it may, this 
story of an American multimillionaire, who makes 
himself Emperor of France, without shedding any 



blood in the attempt, is what unconventional youth 
would call " a rattling good book," and what sober 
reflection is bound to admit to be animated and 
exciting in a very marked degree. It is a sort of 
compound of the daring of Dumas, Sue, and Jules 
Verne, with no style to speak of, and with nothing 
that could be called delineation of character, but 
with inventive and narrative qualities that do some- 
thing to make up for the lack of more serious ones. 

" A Princess and a Woman " is a romance of the 
"Zenda" type, and tells how a dashing young 
American officer won the heart and the hand of a 
princess, in spite of the determination of the Rus- 
sian court to force her marriage with the ill-favored 
Prince of Carpathia. It is a fairly clever and well- 
managed book, written by Mr. Robert McDonald, 
and published as the first of a new copyright series 
of cloth-bound volumes to be sold at the very low 
price of twenty-five cents each. The projector of 
this commendable enterprise is Mr. Frank Munsey, 
the proprietor of a well-known monthly magazine. 

When one of Mr. Stockton's books has been de- 
scribed, the epithets needed for the rest of them are 
exhausted. "A Story-Teller's Pack," containing 
eleven tales, exhibits the whimsical humor with 
which we are so familiar, the ingenuity of invention, 
and the cheery outlook upon life. The stories are 
certainly amusing, particularly those called " The 
Staying Power of Sir Rohan," "As One Woman to 
Another," and "The Widow's Cruise." Perhaps it 
is because this latter title was already preempted 
that the author did not give it to the story of " Mrs. 
Cliff's Yacht," which it would have fitted so admir-

bone of contention between the tribes lying to the

contests like those of Bryant's Station and the Blue 
Licks. It is difficult to make students of old-world 
history believe that these conflicts in the western 
wilderness rank in importance with the battles that 
brought the countries of central and northern 
Europe under the dominion of civilized man ; but 
time is showing that such is the fact. The Kentucky 
stories are the more important because they fre- 
quently show British officers from Canada leading 
the Indians on their forays. It was at Bryant's 
Station, the reader will remember, that the women 
and girls, twenty-eight in number, when the garrison 
was on the point of perishing for water, issued from 
the gate, covered as it was by the rifles of the war- 
riors in hiding, proceeded to the spring, filled their 
pails and piggins, and returned in safety to their hus- 
bands, fathers, and brothers who were standing to 
their guns behind the stockade, the savages refrain- 
ing from firing upon them or seizing them because 
their white commander had ordered them to wait 
until guns were heard on the other side of the station. 
A Kentucky orator has compared the act to the deed 
of David's three mighty men of war who broke 
through the ranks of the Philistines and brought 
water for their chieftain from the well at Bethlehem. 
The act was in fact a more daring one. " The basin 
of the spring was not deep enough to plunge the 
vessels and thus fill them at once. They had to dip 
the water with gourds, and thus tediously and slowly 
fill their vessels. During this slow process, which 
lengthened moments into hours, a glance to the right 
or left might have met the glittering black eyes of 
bloodthirsty savages peeping from behind trees or 
from among the undergrowth which concealed them. 
. . . The girls were not probably fully aware of the 
danger incurred, but the women comprehended the 
situation fully," says one of the writers, " and by an 
act of cool and deliberate courage won for them- 
selves a name which should never pass from the 
memorial page of our history." The present num- 
ber is one of the largest of the Filson Club Publica- 
tions, and appears, in the same sumptuous style as 
its predecessors, from the press of Messrs. John P. 
Morton & Co., of Louisville. 

An entertaining little book that comes 
with a certain timeliness, after recent 
events in the East, is Captain John 
Codman's " An American Transport in the Crimean 
War " (Bonnell, Silver & Co.). Mr. John Codman 
Ropes, the author's cousin, has supplied a brief 
commendatory introduction. The book forms at 
once a capital sailor's yarn and an instructive foot- 
note to the history of the Crimean war. Captain 
Codman sailed for Marseilles, May 20, 1854, in 
command of the " William Penn," a small steam 
freighter with accommodations for twenty odd 
passengers. The " Penn " was a pioneer vessel of 
her class, and her experimental venture proved a 
failure. After lying idle at Marseilles for a time, 
she was chartered by the French government for 
transport service, and sent to the Crimea with a

Crimean war. 



cargo of stores and ammunition and a detach- 
ment of troops. The author's account of this trip, 
and of the " Penn's " subsequent adventures as a 
transport plying between the scene of hostilities 
in the Crimea and the various bases of supplies, 
is decidedly readable. After the expiration of his 
contract with the French, he took service with the 
Turks, the runs being mostly between Constanti- 
nople and Varna or Eupatoria. His experiences 
with the Turks were on the whole agreeable. In 
their service, he says, " we had an exceedingly easy 
time. The French idea of putting off nothing for 
the morrow that could be done to-day was exactly 
reversed. ... I honestly think there was a great 
deal of pay for very little work." Captain Cod- 
man's account of Turkish officials and their ways is 
amusing and not unfavorable. His first encounter 
with the Turk, officially, was at Nagara Point in 
the Dardanelles, where the " Penn " went aground 
" on the very spot where Leander landed when he 
swam the Hellespont." The reigning official of 
the place, Suleyman Pasha, was most kind and 
attentive to the stranded "Giaours," and it was 
mainly through his aid that the " Penn " was finally 
floated. When the question of remuneration was 
delicately broached to this good Samaritan, he 
seized Captain Codman's hand, and placing it upon 
his heart, replied : " God pays me, my brother." 
Could (or would) a Christian have said more? 
Suleyman Pasha was a strict (if literal) observer 
of the forms described by the Prophet. When he 
dined on board the " Penn," Captain Codman, on 
the principle of not tempting one's brother to offend, 
carefully excluded wine from the table. " Think, 
then," he says, " of my astonishment at a gentle 
hint from the Pasha as to champagne ! It was of 
course immediately produced. Upon my remark- 
ing that it had not been offered before on account 
of what I supposed to be his religious scruples, he 
replied with an air of perfect sincerity, ' Wine was 
forbidden by the prophet ; not champagne. Cham- 
pagne did not exist in his day ; how then could he 
have forbidden it ? Marshallah ! God is great,' con- 
tinned Suleyman, smoothing his beard and soothing 
his conscience. ' Pass the bottle.' " Captain Cod- 
man's little book is well worth reading. 

The essay which gives title to Mrs. 
Marriage question* E R Chapman's "Marriage Ques- 

in literature. . . / , _. . , , 

tions in Modern fiction, and other 
Essays " (John Lane) is recent ; the others belong 
to different years in the past decade, although all 
have been carefully revised for publication. The 
book is therefore interesting, if only as giving some 
idea of the increase of a tendency which most of us 
have got so used to that we hardly appreciate it. 
Yet it certainly is remarkable that the chief novels 
of the last few years should so often deal in one way 
or another with what may be vaguely called " mar- 
riage questions." And this larger sphere the 
sphere of " Tess of the d'Urbervilles," of " Trilby," 
of " Lord Ormont," of " The Manxman " is only

the nebula (so far as this matter is concerned) of 
the more intense core furnished by such books as 
" The Story of an African Farm," " The Heavenly 
Twins," " The Woman who Did," " Jude the Ob- 
scure." Books like these latter are more or less 
propogandist ; but even books like the former show 
the workings of the thought of our time. In view 
of all this, Mrs. Chapman argues, simply enough, 
and sensibly, for indissoluble marriage and no 
divorce at all. The conclusion is a difficult one to 
avoid, if one accepts the idea of a life-union of one 
man and one woman as being the ideal to be ulti- 
mately attained. We need not, however, give Mrs. 
Chapman's arguments nor our own commentary ; it 
is enough here to mention her rational tone and her 
success in avoiding the absurdity and tediousness 
one sometimes finds in discussions on the subject. 
Beside the title-essay, and four others on marriage 
and divorce, there are two on literary topics : one 
on " The Disparagement of Women in Literature," 
and one on u St. Paul and the Woman Movement," 
both interesting. The first amazes us (trained as 
we were to an opposite view by Mr. Ruskin in his 
monograph on " Queen's Gardens " ) by the devel- 
opment of the thesis that Shakespeare arrogantly, 
and in a domineering way, regarded women as 
inferior to men. The second essay shows that St. 
Paul emphasized the inferior position of women, 
a matter of very slight importance, since there are 
few wives who, however sound on the question of 
verbal inspiration, regard the word " obey " as other 
than an empty conventionality. This matter of the 
inferiority of woman does not appear to us to be one 
to be settled by present argument. There can be 
little doubt that woman was the inferior sex, phys- 
ically and mentally. Without inquiry into the rea- 
son, such was the fact, and on that fact arose tradi- 
tion and convention. Now, we understand, the fact 
is otherwise, or at least ought to be. New traditions 
and new conventions will doubtless accommodate 
themselves to the new fact. Meanwhile, why not 
let St. Paul and Shakespeare rest in peace? 

The original Prof essor Hart's "American History 

materials of Told by Contemporaries " (Macmil- 

American history. lan ) J 8 ft cont ribution to the Source, 

or laboratory, method of teaching history. Stated 
in its extreme form, this method puts the pupil, as 
soon as he is furnished with any, even the slender- 
est, thread of historical narrative, at the sources, or 
documents, and leaves him, with more or less help, 
to elaborate his own history from the materials. 
Stated in a more conservative manner, it introduces 
the student, when he has made a certain rather indef- 
inite degree of progress in the study of historical 
text-books, to original material, and leaves him, 
under competent direction, to check and work out 
results for himself, and, what is more important, 
to master the method of historical investigation. At 
the core, the two forms of statement do not disagree ; 
the only open question is, How soon the pupil shall 
be introduced to the source method ? The truth is, 



this question cannot be answered in term ; sources 
will be so gradually introduced in good history teach- 
ing, and text-books so progressively laid aside, that 
there is no abrupt passage from the one method to 
the other. Carried to an extreme, the new method 
will do much harm ; used judiciously, it is capable 
of accomplishing great good. In fact, it is not so 
" new " as it seems to be ; to read the Declaration 
of Independence, the Constitution of the United 
States, Washington's Farewell Address, or Lincoln's 
Inaugural Addresses, is to study history in its 
sources ; so that what is really new is the enhanced 
emphasis and the new methods of providing and 
handling material. Professor Hart holds to the 
source method in its more conservative form, and 
has undertaken to prepare a series of volumes of 
sources to promote its use. Volume I. ("Era of 
Colonization, 1492-1689 "), now before us, is the 
first of the series. The selections are well made, 
well arranged, and well printed ; and the volume, 
like those that are to follow, cannot fail to receive 
a warm welcome from all teachers and students of 
American history. We have heard a very competent 
professor of American history express regret that 
the apparatus of annotation and criticism is not more 
abundant; and the point seems to be well taken. 
Still, considerable assistance of this kind is afforded 
the reader. The book takes its place at once on the 
shelf as indispensable. 

Early critical The " Quarterly Review " was once 
work of much vexed at Mr. Edmund Gosse 

Mr. GO***. because, while Clark Professor of 

Poetry at the University of Cambridge, he prefaced 
his learned work " From Shakespeare to Pope " with 
a poem in which he represented himself as a spar- 
row sitting on a clothes-line in Mr. W. D. Howells's 
back-yard. We think that this was a harmless fancy 
on the part of the amiable critic, and we regret that 
he has not prefaced the revised edition of his 
"Seventeenth Century Studies" (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.) with a little poem representing himself as a 
lark, disdaining the earth in the roseate dawn and 
blithely singing of divine things while lost in the 
empyrean. Such a conception would, we think, 
attune the mind of the reader to the " criticism " in 
the book, which is called " a contribution to the his- 
tory of English Poetry." Mr. Gosse himself has 
elsewhere expressed his idea of the advantage to the 
writer of literary history of " a rare combination of 
exact knowledge with the power of graceful com- 
position." The fact that he does not mention sound 
judgment as another useful possession will not sur- 
prise those familiar with his work. This book cer- 
tainly shows graceful composition : Mr. Gosse has 
the gift, or art, of writing, in a way that interests 
one. But as for exact knowledge and sound judg- 
ment, these are things that no one need expect from 
him. This book has been before the public fourteen 
years, in part more. In that time it has been criti- 
cised for absurdities of judgment and statement, 
not so much as some of the works of Mr. Gosse,

it is true, but still enough to be noticed. In the 
present edition, some additions have been made, 
but not a single correction ; nor is there any allu- 
sion to any criticism, except a letter from Mr. Lowell 
in regard to one of his poems, concerning which 
Mr. Gosse appeared to have a false idea. The book 
is the same charming composition which has attracted 
so many to various half-forgotten poets of the seven- 
teenth century that its sins of omission and com- 
mission are doubtless often forgiven it. 

A converted Thirty years of recreative study fill 

pagan of the the fat volume containing Archbishop 

third century. Benson's "Cyprian, his Life, his 
Time, his Work " (Appleton). The author found 
peculiar fascination in the story of this converted 
pagan. As a sort of mental athletics, and retreat 
from the duties of his church, be has pursued for 
thirty years a very minute investigation of the lit- 
erature on this ancient church father, and his book 
represents monumental and scholarly and loving 
sympathetic industry. The period of history whose 
story is told here covers fifteen years (246-260 
B. C.) in the third century. The charming city of 
Carthage, the queen of Northern Africa, is the 
principal scene of the Cyprianic trials, triumphs, 
and tragedy. Cyprian's heathen education, his con- 
version to Christianity, his promotion in the Church, 
his sacrifices, his sufferings, his theological beliefs, 
his persecutions, and his martyrdom, are all fol- 
lowed out with such nicety of detail and keenness of 
discrimination as to leave nothing further to be de- 
sired. The persecutions of Roman emperors, the 
Church councils, the dogmas of leaders, are analyzed 
and set forth with scholarly exactness. Though he 
was a close imitator and admirer of Tertullian, we 
are led to see that Cyprian occupies a unique place 
in the African Church. It is refreshing to see that 
the author has utilized the best and latest literature 
on the subject; the Index gives the titles of ninety- 
four works, in Latin, German, and French, quoted 
and referred to in the body of the book. Foot-notes 
abound, as they should, in confirmation of the views 
advanced by the author. Ten appendices deal with 
special themes touching the times of Cyprian. A 
few woodcuts and three elegant maps add to the 
attractiveness of the volume. Though not easy read- 
ing for other than Church historians and similar 
specialists, this sumptuous volume will not for long 
years cease to be the standard life of the great 
African churchman. 



Memories of 
Hawthorne. 



No American author has achieved a 
reputation more secure than that of 
Hawthorne. Hence, perhaps, it will 
be with many that of no American author would 
they more gladly see a volume of Memories. It is 
pretty certain, however, that the real interest in 
Hawthorne concerns itself more with his work than 
with his personal character, and it is very probable, 
too, that no matter how many volumes of reminis- 
cence might appear, we should never know much 



more of him than we might now. Hawthorne would 
seem to have been more or less like the man in 
" Wakefield ": he habitually lived in the next street 
from his family. Still, they sometimes saw him, and 
these little snatches make Mrs. Rose Hawthorne 
Lathrop's " Memories of Hawthorne " (Houghton) 
an exceedingly interesting book, as indeed every- 
one would imagine. It is, as Mrs. Lathrop says, 
really written by her mother, being largely made up 
from Sophia Hawthorne's letters. The interest in 
the book is partly domestic: it is the picture of 
Hawthorne playing blindman's buff with the " Old 
People " (as he called his children), or of Hawthorne 
cultivating incomparable vegetables in the garden of 
the Manse, or harvesting water-lilies on the Assahet ; 
and it is partly historical : as with the skating-party, 
for instance, of Hawthorne wrapped in a cloak, 
skating like a Greek statue, Thoreau figuring dithy- 
rambic dances and Bacchic leaps, and Emerson all 
tired out coming to rest by Mrs. Hawthorne. Lit- 
erary the book is not, in the sense, that is, that we 
do not learn from it much of Hawthorne the man 
of letters. It is as well that we do not : Hawthorne 
the genius is to be found sufficiently in what he 
wrote. In this volume Hawthorne the man, amid 
his surroundings, comes to view cordially and even 
intimately. He was a man rather different from 
what any reader of his books would imagine, and 
although in this book he is always in the background, 
yet even though he be not clearly presented, we get 
probably a truer idea of his personality than we 
could from a more definite presentation. 

Mr. J. E. Farmer's "Essays on 
French History " (Putnam) are two 
in number, and they make but a 
slender volume. The author has not burrowed 
very deeply into the sources of history, and his style 
is somewhat crude ; yet he has got together many 
details in the history of two important periods that 
even careful readers could find only with some dif- 
ficulty. The opening essay is on " The Rise of the 
Reformation in France and its Relation to Martin 
Luther ; " the other, which is a stronger piece of 
work, is a sketch of the history of " The Club of 
the Jacobins." The description of the methods 
used in controlling the Assembly and directing the 
current of affairs by organized mob violence is of 
special interest. 

The history of British India, as told 
by R. W. Frazer in his recent addi- 
tion to the " Story of the Nations " 
series (Putnam), is a most interesting narrative and 
a good piece of popular history-writing. Beginning 
with the early history of Indian commerce, Mr. 
Frazer traces the rise of English influence through 
the founding and growth of the East India Company ; 
England's bitter struggles with the Portuguese, 
Dutch, and French; the gradual conquest of the 
vast country ; and the later history of the organiza- 
tion and strengthening of the government. In the

final chapter the author discusses the moral and 
material progress under British rule. The thrilling 
events associated with the names of Dupleix, Clive, 
Hastings, Havelock, and Lawrence, are described 
briefly but with spirit. England's policy in seizing 
the principalities and appropriating the wealth of the 
princes is not upheld from the strictly moral point 
of view, but the author significantly likens it to her 
present policy in South Africa and Russia's policy 
in the Northern Pacific which he regards as justi- 
fiable aggressions for the sake of trade and imperial 
influence. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

The fifth volume of Henry Craik's " Selections from 
English Prose " (Macmillan) concludes an important 
work, which was reviewed at length in THE DIAL of 
Sept. 1, 1893. The volume includes passages from 
forty-six different writers, beginning with Scott and 
ending with Stevenson. The original plan for four vol- 
umes only has been enlarged to include a fifth, owing to 
the riches of our prose literature, so that the number 
and variety of the examples chosen have been corre- 
spondingly increased. The selections have been well 
made, the introductions are by the same well-known 
critics and men of letters, and, owing to its nearness to 
ourselves, the last volume of the set surpasses in interest 
and value any that have preceded. The complete work 
is now published in a handsome library edition, in the 
same number of volumes. 

The Chautauqua books for the coming year, five in 
number as usual, have just been published by Messrs. 
Flood & Vincent, and are as usual well-chosen and 
attractive. " Roman Life in Pliny's Time," by M. Mau- 
rice Pellison, is translated from the French by Miss 
Maud Wilkinson. "A Short History of Mediseval 
Europe," by Dr. Oliver J. Thatcher, is an abridgment 
of the larger " Europe in the Middle Age," by the au- 
thor and Dr. Schwill. This work is also published by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. " Imperial Germany," 
by Mr. Sidney Whitman, is a new edition of a work 
nearly ten years old. Mr. W. H. Goodyear's " Roman 
and Mediaeval Art " is also the revision of an earlier 
publication. Last of all, we have a volume upon " The 
Social Spirit in America," by Prof. C. R. Henderson, 
whose name is very familiar to our readers, and whose 
work forms an admirable introduction to the subject of 
social science.

Madame Sarah Grand's new novel, the first that she 
has published since "The Heavenly Twins," will be 
issued in November by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 

A new one-volume edition of the perennial " Boswell's 
Life of Johnson," edited by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald, will 
be published early in September by Mr. Thomas Whit- 
taker. 

"The Public School Arithmetic," by Messrs. J. A. 



McLellan and A. F. Ames, based on Messrs. McLellan 
and Dewey's Psychology of Number," is issued by the 
Macmillan Co. 

Mr. Hall Caine's new novel, The Christian," has just 
been published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. The 
first London edition, published by Mr. William Heine- 
mann, consisted of 50,000 copies. 

Carlyle's " French Revolution," in three volumes, has 
been added to the Dent-Macmillan series of " Temple 
Classics." A welcome feature of this beautiful little 
edition is the special biographical index prepared by the 
editor, Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson. 

" The Merry Devil of Edmonton," edited by Mr. 
Hugh Walker, is the latest addition to the series of 
" Temple Dramatists," published in this country by the 
Macmillan Co. The same publishers send us " A Distin- 
guished Provincial at Paris," in their handsome edition 
of Balzac. 

Biographical dictionaries seem to be a feature of the 
closing years of the century. The latest one announced 
is "Lamb's Biographical Dictionary of the United 
States," in six large volumes, edited by Mr. John 
Howard Brown and published by the Cyclopaedia Pub- 
lishing Co. of Boston. 

We are glad to note such excellent appointments, 
under the new Librarian of Congress, as those of Mr. 
Spofford, Mr. Solberg, and Mr. Hutcheson, to leading 
and responsible positions in the library. While it must 
be a matter of regret that the selection of a chief for 
our national library was not made from among profes- 
sional library managers, rather than made on political 
grounds, yet it is to Mr. Young's credit that he under- 
stands so well the kind of men needed for the successful 
working of the great institution under his charge. 

Baron Pierre de Coubertin is a young French writer 
who is rapidly making his mark in serious literature. 
We received some time ago his valuable work on 
" L'Evolution Franchise sous la Froisieme Re'publique," 
which is now soon to appear in an English translation. 
Still more recently, his " Souvenirs d'Ame'rique et de 
Grece " has been published, and we have found the 
sketches of travel which it contains interesting without 
being frothy. The author is a keen observer of men 
and manners, and his style has an agreeable animation. 
The London " Review of Reviews " announces that 
the seventh volume of the valuable and exhaustive 
" Annual Index to Periodicals," covering the year 1896, 
is now ready. The indexing and compilation of the 
volume is the work of Miss E. Hetherington. In this 
connection we may repeat our commendation of the 
u Cumulative Index " to a selected list of periodicals, a 
publication which is searchingly thorough for the ground 
it covers, and has the distinctive feature of embodying 
in each monthly issue all the matter printed in previous 
issues since the beginning of the year. It is published 
by the Cleveland Public Library. 

An important movement for the higher education of 
Catholic young women in this country has been under- 
taken under the direction and control of the Sisters of 
Notre Dame, who announce the purchase of twenty 
acres of land in Washington, adjoining the site of the 
Catholic University, on which they will establish an 
institution to be known as Trinity College for Catholic 
Women. It will be devoted to post-graduate work 
exclusively, and will offer three regular courses, extend- 
ing through four years. The requirements for admis- 
sion are already issued.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 

THE CONQREQATIONALIST says: 

"It is a practical hand-book of the highest value for 
Biblical study." February 4, 1897. 

THE DIAL says : 

" The new ' Illustrated Bible Treasury ' reaches the acme 
in the field of Bible students' helps. The catalogue of themes 
treated and the compactness and lucidity of the articles are a 
delight to the reader. The wealth of illustrations of the best 
sort not old worn-out cuts adds greatly to the beauty and 
completeness of the articles. The natural history sections 
are especially fine in matter and make-up. The Concordance 
is the most complete yet produced, being adapted both to 
the Authorized and to the Revised Versions, and containing 
also proper names. ... Is nearest the ideal Bible student's 
manual of any publication in its field." 

THE CHRISTIAN INTELLIGENCER says : 

" 'The Illustrated Bible Treasury,' edited by William 
Wright, D.D., is one of the most valuable ' helps ' to Bible 
study within our knowledge. . . . Such a publication as this 
attests not only the advance in Biblical scholarship, but the 
widespread interest there is in the Book of books." 

"... It has no superior, . . . the best series of ' Helps ' 
in existence. It is, indeed, a ' Treasury ' filled with pearls 
of great price." March 10, 1897. 

BISHOP JOHN H. VINCENT says : 

" The 'Bold Type Bible ' is a treasure, but the ' Dlustrated 
Bible Treasury ' is a marvel of sacred art and learning. 
Nothing that I have seen equals this new provision for the 
Bible student." August 13, 1897. 

THE SUNDAY SCHOOL WORLD says : 

"... Looking at the ' Treasury ' in its broader features, 
and as the latest ' Helps ' for Teachers' Bibles, the intelligent 
reader will, we think, pronounce it a decided advance upon 
any that have hitherto appeared. ... IT WILL EASILY TAKE 

A FOREMOST RANK WITH ALL BlBLE STUDENTS."

THE CHRISTIAN. 

By HALL CAINE, author of "The Manxman," "The Deemster," "The Bondman," etc. 

12mo, cloth, $1.50. 

"The public is hardly prepared for so remarkable a performance as 'The Christian.' It is a great social 
panorama, crowded with living figures, phases of life, color, and incidents. All these are knit together and made 
live by constant action. There is not a lay figure in the book ; every man and woman is a living, breathing, thinking, 
acting creature. ... As great as ' The Christian ' undoubtedly is, considered as a portrayal of certain portions of 
the social fabric, it is even greater when considered as a story. . . . The Christian ' will almost certainly be the 
book of the year. It is a permanent addition to English literature. It is bound to be very popular, but it is above 
and beyond any popularity that is merely temporal." Boston Herald.

powerful ; and the smoothness, the never-failing interest, the limpid 
clearness, the simplicity of the argument, and the timeliness, will make 
it extremely popular. Here is a book that everyone will read and 
enjoy." Boston Herald. 

" ' Equality ' will raise many discussions. The subject which Mr. 
Bellamy writes about is inexhaustible, and it has never-f ailins human 
interest." New York Times. 

" Deserves praise for its completeness. It shows the thought and 
work of years. It apparently treats of every phase of the subject. . . . 
Altogether praiseworthy and quite remarkable." Chicago Tribune.

"Uarda," "Cleopatra," "Joshua," etc. Translated by 
MARY J. SAFFORD. Two vols., 16mo, cloth, $1.50 ; paper, 
SOcts. 

The time of this strong historical romance is the period of turmoil 
which followed the death of Luther, when Protestants and Catholics 
were struggling for the mastery in Germany and the Netherlands. The 
story opens in the city of Ratisbon, where Charles V. meets Barbara 
Blomberg, and is captivated by her voice, in spite of the distractions 
caused by warring princes and burghers. Later the story changes to 
the Netherlands and pictures the stirring scenes preceding the work of 
liberation. The romance offers a series of vivid sketches of dramatic 
events which had far-reaching consequences.

By HAMLIN GARLAND, author of " A Spoil of Office," " A

"In these stories Mr. Garland presents photographic impressions of 
the West, every one of which has pathos and power behind it, and viril- 
ity and character to recommend it. The spell of romanticism over- 
shadows them all ; yet they are distinctly different in form and enthu- 
siasm." Boston Herald.

A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE. 

By C. C. HOTCHKISS, author of "In Defiance of the King." 

The welcome given to " In Defiance of the King " proves the growth 
of American appreciation of new American writers of genuine talent. 
In this new romance of the Revolution Mr. Hotchkias shows a power of 
sustained interest and a command of dramatic effects which will make 
his book a notable addition to our fiction. The scene of his stirring tale 
is laid for the most part in old New York during the British occupancy, 
on Long Island Sound, and on Martha's Vineyard. It is certain that no 
one who has begun this spirited and fascinating story will leave it un- 
finished.

HERO-WORSHIP. 

Two or three years ago, Professor John W. 
Burgess made some suggestive remarks, which 
we are about to quote, upon the ethics of hero- 
worship. Their immediate application was to 
the American anti- slavery agitation and the 
John Brown cult, but they convey a lesson and 
a warning that should be taken to heart in con- 
nection with many other subjects, not only in 
the department of political history, but in all 
the fields of human endeavor. " I consider," 
he said, " that the highest responsibility resting 



upon an historian is the right selection of those 
personalities which he holds up for the worship 
of after generations. The morals of the age 
are determined most largely by the character 
of its heroes. No amount of precept, religious 
or ethical, will have one tithe of the influence 
in forming the ideals of our youth that hero- 
worship possesses. If there is, then, one mo- 
ment more solemn than another in the life of 
the historian, one when he should seek more 
earnestly than at another to be delivered from 
all prejudice, error, and weakness, it is when 
he essays the role of the hero-maker. If he 
fails in this, he may well question if all the 
other good he may have accomplished has not 
been over-balanced. There is a mawkish notion 
prevalent among the members of a certain very 
advanced class of people in almost all parts of 
the world, that if you add cant to crime you 
lessen the crime. Some of them think that the 
outcome of such a combination is the most 
heroic virtue. All of us judge crime more 
leniently when committed by persons who have 
views in common with us upon some important 
subject, and against persons whom we regard 
with feelings of hostility. But the moralist, the 
historian, and the inventor of epics are under 
bonds to civilization to rise above such weak- 
ness." 

The false kind of sentiment that is here con- 
demned in such impressive terms has done 
much mischief in perverting the ethical judg- 
ments passed by mankind upon the conspicuous 
figures of history. In ancient times, it deified 
Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, to say 
nothing of a long line of lesser conquerors 
and leaders of victorious hosts. In our own 
century, it has made of Napoleon a subject for 
eulogy rather than for execration, it has in a 
measure justified the career of the man of 
" blood and iron " who looms so large in the 
history of modern Germany, and it is now en- 
gaged in glossing over the unscrupulous methods 
of the ambitious adventurer who has come to 
regard South Africa as his own personal ap- 
panage. It would seem, indeed, when we con- 
sider these and the many similar cases which 
history presents to our view, that success, by 
whatever means achieved, is too often taken by 
the public as the adequate test of greatness, 
and that a man's career passes for heroic if

only it be sufficiently brilliant to attract wide- 
spread attention, and sufficiently daring to 
impose upon the imagination of men. The 
ethical philosopher, of course, bases his judg- 
ment upon other criteria than these, for he 
knows that failure is often more heroic than 
success, and that many a mute inglorious ca- 
reer, with which only the few are acquainted, 
may offer a finer example for the emulation of 
mankind than is offered by the lives of those 
who shine in the fierce light that beats upon 
the seats of the mighty. 

Carlyle has done much to glorify the type 
of man who succeeds by sheer strength of will, 
and the gospel of brute force has collected a 
singular company in his gallery of heroic 
figures. Yet it is from Carlyle himself that we 
have chosen a passage which emphasizes, better 
than it has often been emphasized, the eternal 
distinction between the strength that should 
command our admiration and the strength that 
is perversely employed. " A certain strong 
man, of former time, fought stoutly at Lepanto ; 
worked stoutly as Algerine slave ; stoutly de- 
livered himself from such working ; with stout 
cheerfulness endured famine and nakedness 
and the world's ingratitude ; and, sitting in jail, 
with the one arm left him, wrote our joyfullest, 
and all but our deepest, modern book, and 
named it ' Don Quijote ': this was a genuine 
strong man. A strong man, of recent time, 
fights little for any good cause anywhere ; works 
weakly as an English lord ; weakly delivers 
himself from such working ; with weak despon- 
dency endures the cackling of plucked geese at 
St. James's ; and, sitting in sunny Italy, in his 
coach- and-f our, at a distance of two thousand 
miles from them, writes, over many reams of 
paper, the following sentence, with variations : 
' Saw ever the world one greater or un happier? ' 
This was a sham strong man. Choose ye." 
While this comparison, in its straining for 
antithetical effects, is not altogether fair to 
Byron, whose life was at least closed by a piece 
of genuine heroism, yet in the main it enforces 
a lesson that should be taken to heart. The 
Byronic cult was undoubtedly in its day respon- 
sible for a great deal of sickly sentimentalism, 
and its influence still lingers in English litera- 
ture. As contrasted with Shelley's ardent and 
high-souled devotion to great causes and fine 
ideals, the passion of Byron at its best seems 
theatrical and insincere, and the gospel of 
" Childe Harold " is but a poor thing when 
viewed in the glowing light of the " Prometheus 
Unbound." 



In literature, as in other departments of hu- 
man activity, there are sham heroes as well as 
genuine ones. This statement is not meant to 
imply that a writer whose private life will not 
bear the closest scrutiny is for that reason un- 
heroic as a literary figure, for the weakness of 
will by which personal conduct is so often mis- 
shapen may coexist with an intellectual life of 
the rarest distinction. And since the essential 
thing about a writer is his work, he has a right 
to be judged by that work, almost irrespective 
of the life that lies behind it. The figure of 
Schopenhauer, for example, is one of the most 
heroic in literature, although the character of 
the man, as apart from the writer, left much 
to be desired. But the noble sincerity of his 
work, and its exaltation of fine ideals in both 
thought and conduct, are qualities so marked 
that we are quite justified in ignoring the un- 
lovely aspects of the personal biography. On 
the other hand, the most conspicuous of literary 
figures may fail to assume heroic proportions 
if the work for which it stands have any sug- 
gestion of pose or insincerity. We may be very 
indulgent to the infirmities of the flesh, pro- 
vided only they do not fetter or drag down the 
spirit. There is a false ring, which no sound- 
ing rhetoric can altogether deaden to the dis-. 
cerning ear, in the work of many masterful 
writers, and when that ring is once detected, 
the power of the voice to shape our intellectual 
ideals becomes sadly weakened. This false 
note may be caught over and over again in 
Byron ; it makes the Whitman cult seem a 
strange phenomenon to minds entirely well- 
balanced and sane, and it lessens the effect- 
ive appeal of even such giants as Hugo and 
Carlyle. 

When we think of certain figures in litera- 
ture as peculiarly heroic, we do not usually stop 
for analysis, but are content to rest the judg- 
ment upon a mixture of impressions, in part 
derived from the life, and in part from the work. 
Scott and Balzac are good examples of this, for 
both are heroic figures in a very genuine sense, 
and we hardly know whether to admire them the 
more for their courageous struggle against ad- 
verse material conditions or for their resolute 
pursuit of a great creative purpose. Instead 
of taking these men for our illustration, let us 
take instead a man who was a hero of litera- 
ture pure and simple, a man whose career has 
for the literary worker the same sort of lessons 
that the career of Spinoza has for the philoso- 
pher, of Gordon for the soldier, or of Mazzini 
for the statesman. The man is Gustave Flau- 



1897.]

bert, and our task is made easy by borrowing 
from the eloquent address made at Oxford last 
June by M. Paul Bourget. " No man was ever 
more richly endowed with the higher virtues of 
a great literary artist," says M. Bourget. " His 
whole existence was one long struggle against 
circumstances and against himself, to live up 
to that ideal standard as a writer which he had 
set before himself from his earliest years. . . . 
He remains ever present among us, in spite of 
the new developments assumed by contempo- 
rary French literature, for he gave to all writ- 
ers the most splendid example of passionate, 
exclusive love of literature. With his long 
years of patient and scrupulous toil, his noble 
contempt of wealth, honours, and popularity, 
with his courage in pursuing to the end the 
realization of his dream, he looms upon us an 
intellectual hero." 

And yet, with all his passion for the imper- 
sonal, with all his striving to view life from the 
outside, holding, or at least expressing, "no 
form of creed, but contemplating all," the final 
lesson of Flaubert's life is, as his eulogist ad- 
mits, that no man may wholly exclude himself 
from his writings. Had the author of " Madame 
Bo vary " really done so, " they would not have 
reached us all imbued with that melancholy 
savour, that subdued pathos which makes them 
so dear to us. ... This gift of expressing in 
their writings more than they themselves sus- 
pect, and of achieving results exceeding their 
ambition, is only granted to those courageous 
and sincere geniuses whose past trials have 
gained for them the priceless treasure of wide 
experience. Thus did Cervantes write ' Don 
Quijote,' and Defoe ' Robinson Crusoe,' little 
dreaming that they infused into their writings, 
the former all the glowing heroism of Spain, 
the latter the dogged self-reliance of the Anglo- 
Saxon. If they had not themselves for many 
years practised these virtues of chivalrous enter- 
prise in the one case, of indomitable endurance 
in the other, their books would have been what 
they intended them to be mere tales of adven- 
ture. But their souls were greater than their 
art, and imbued it throughout with that sym- 
bolic power which is the efficient vitality of 
books. In the same way Flaubert's soul was 
greater than his art, and it is that soul which, 
in spite of his own will, he breathed into his 
writings, gaining for them a place apart in the 
history of the contemporary French novel." 
Thus we come back, after all, to the position 
that heroism in literary production is somehow 
the outcome or reflex of something heroic in 



the character and the temper of the writer. 
It may be only a streak, so blended with others 
as to be almost undiscernible to observers of 
the man apart from his books, yet it is the 
deepest and truest part of him, and a noble 
book of any sort may well give pause to the 
judgment that too hastily condemns a man's 
life because it is visibly flawed. But those men 
are the fittest subjects for hero-worship in whom 
the life and the word are the most fully conso- 
nant, whose lives are poems, and whose words 
are acts. Such a hero was Goethe, with his 
life-long devotion to the ideal that held the 
whole of life to be even more important than 
its separate elements of the good and the beau- 
tiful ; such was Milton, whose " soul was like 
a star, and dwelt apart," and yet whose heart 
" the lowliest duties on herself did lay "; such 
was Dante, whose exiled soul still " possessed 
the sun and stars," and whose divine poem was 
wrought not as a poem merely, but 

" With close heed 

Lest, having spent for the work's sake 
Six days, the man be left to make." 



A MODERN TYPE OF UNIVERSITY 
INSTRUCTOR AT BERLIN. 

The treatment of German literature in universi- 
ties has been as varied as the philosophical, political, 
aesthetic, philological, and psychological ideals of 
those who have represented it. During recent years, 
the " Young Grammarian " school, to which the 
monuments of literature have served chiefly as a 
medium for the exhibition of organic processes in 
language, has exercised great influence in America. 
The attractiveness of this school is not hard to ex- 
plain: it had, while still "young," the freshness of 
all beginnings, and it was a field in which a given 
amount of specialized research was rewarded by a 
maximum quantity of material and new results. 
Whether the school has already reaped its best 
fruits, is a fair question, though one which does not 
properly belong here. Certain it is that its methods 
of research have intruded entirely too much into the 
field of literary history ; and the inquiry cannot be 
avoided, especially in the United States, whether the 
great widening of the scope of Germanic courses 
has been accompanied by a corresponding deepening 
of their contents. 

The most successful and popular among the pro- 
fessors of the humanities in the University of Berlin 
is one who deals with the broadest realities, and 
who lays the chief accent upon the aesthetic element. 
I have not been able to get figures as to the attend- 
ance upon the three courses given by Professor 
Erich Schmidt during the winter semester, but they

[Sept. 1, 



must have included five hundred enthusiastic 
hearers. The underlying conception of Professor 
Schmidt's influential position in this central uni- 
versity is that he stands as a guardian of the na- 
tional literary treasure, and has the duty of being 
fully acquainted with it himself, of preserving it 
unimpaired, and of demonstrating it to others. His 
ideal of criticism aims at arriving at the sum-total 
of all those factors which have united to produce 
literature : on the one hand, the historical and philo- 
logical treatment of national culture, of the " spirit 
of the times," and of general intellectual move- 
ments ; and, on the other hand, the sharpest possible 
characterization of the individual author. His chief 
virtuosity lies in tracing the historical genesis of a 
given work after the method of natural science, 
following the sources, with much elegance of demon- 
stration, back to their earliest germs, and controlling 
for this purpose an immense store of information, 
embracing the ancient classics and the literature of 
France, England, Spain, and Italy. 

The most convincing impression which Professor 
Schmidt's lectures have made upon me has been 
that of the absolute interdependence of the peoples 
of culture, the emphasis of the fact that no author 
or period can be conceived of as standing alone, 
unconnected with a long chain of preexisting influ- 
ences ; that a pedantic conception of " plagiarism " 
is most irrational. Particularly has he placed in 
the light of a new revelation the enormous influence 
of the great and noble English national literature 
upon Germany. In the treatment of this matter, 
as in many other ways, he shows absolute candor, 
fearlessness of results, and disregard of popular 
prejudices in dealing with scientific truths. The 
treatment is throughout objective rather than dog- 
matically philosophical. He is equally masterful in 
estimating the total tendency of a period, in an 
appreciation of the entire personality of an author 
or of a single work ; as a rule, such concrete judg- 
ments disclose the larger points of view. Every 
product is scrupulously tested and stamped with its 
exact value, a very different thing from a reca- 
pitulation of its contents. These estimates are the 
perfection of condensed expression ; each word is 
weighed on the gold-balance, and produces its full 
effect. One lively epithet sometimes fixes for good 
the final worth of an elaborate work. In these 
judgments, with all their directness and finality, 
there is to be noticed the self-restraint and reserve 
of a large nature, and an abstinence from arbitrary 
personal bias. In treating of a period, while much 
attention is paid to the workings of international 
influence, there is also a consideration of the force 
of political life upon literature. In dealing with 
an author, an estimate is made of the various sides 
of his personality, his growth and development, his 
methods, his merits and limitations, how far he is 
the child of his age, and how far he reaches beyond 
it ; his biography is considered as far as it is con- 
nected with his literary activity, and, especially, an 
estimate is given of his permanent contribution to 



the national literary stock. In the discussion of an 
individual work, there is the consideration of its 
relation to the times in which it was written, of its 
structural technique, style, movement, and psycho- 
logical workings ; of its nearer and remoter sources, 
especially the history, as far as it can be traced, of 
its chief motif. The influence of the work upon its 
own and later times is weighed. In matters relating 
to form and metrical values, Professor Schmidt 
shows, what all professors do not possess, the finest 
feeling for rhythm and delicate internal harmo- 
j nies. Not less admirable than these positive critical 
| deliverances are the wise omissions : the throwing 
j overboard of merely microscopic details in linguis- 
tics, biography, and bibliography. The last matter 
is usually disposed of by naming the best edition of 
the text, and perhaps the titles of one or two new 
books ; and then come the words, " for the rest, see 
Goedeke." Professor Schmidt, as was also the case 
with Scherer, has made Goethe-studies the crown of 
his work ; and it is particularly in the presentation 
of the results of his detailed researches in this field 
that one notices a favorable contrast with that phi- 
lology which of late years has lavished such elabo- 
rate pains upon the publication of Unedited Scraps 
from Goethe's Waste-basket. 

I cannot speak too highly in praise of Professor 
Schmidt's own literary style : it is clear, direct, and 
penetrating ; not a word is to be spared, and yet it 
is wrought out to a finished perfection of form not 
unworthy of one who in literary criticism stands in 
direct succession to Lessing and Herder, Goethe 
and Schiller. This praise must often be withheld 
from eminent critics : one needs only to mention 
the choppy, English-Channel style of the admirable 
Herman Grimm, which, over here, is usually as- 
cribed to the influence of our own Emerson, but 
which, in my opinion, stands about as near to that 
of Walt Whitman. There is lively movement, 
trenchant diction, brilliant wit, and unreserved hu- 
mor, but no cheap embellishment ; though occasion- 
ally metaphorical, the style is always chaste. At 
the same time, Professor Schmidt by no means 
abhors the crisp, forcible, idiomatic phrases, bor- 
dering on the very colloquial, in which the German 
language is so rich, and which often hit the mark 
squarely in the centre. I note with less enthusiasm 
occasional touches of the distinctively national Ger- 
man flavor of Derbheit, a term which Anglo-Saxons 
are prone to translate by the very rude word " coarse- 
ness." Now that co-education has become estab- 
lished in Germany, this feature is at times trying. 
I partly sympathize with the standpoint, and prefer 
it to that of another professor, who excluded all 
women from his courses this term because he felt 
that their presence would lay some restraint upon 
his freedom of treatment. In the academic field, 
if anywhere, plain facts must be handled without 
circumlocution, and Professor Schmidt resolutely 
asserts " das gute Recht der Kritik " in this direc- 
tion. Good. This is quite different, however, from 
a gratuitous amplification of Aristophanic features,

which has more than once been accompanied by 
hilarious merriment and rapturous applause on the 
part of the gentlemen of the audience, who looked 
around gleefully to see how the young women 
present were " taking it," in an unchivalrous way 
which made one's blood boil, but then, chivalry is 
perhaps not the most strongly emphasized trait in 
Bismarck's Germany. The delivery is in a power- 
ful, resonant, dramatic voice, and the lecturer looks 
his audience squarely in the face, although he fol- 
lows his manuscript closely. 

Among the select group of young scholars who 
make up the Seminar, one has a freer opportunity 
of coming to know the resources which are at the 
disposal of its leader, to become more and more 
impressed with his broad grasp of general relations, 
joined to an immense mass of detailed information, 
and to see what demands of actual work the great 
scholar lays upon himself and his students. Woe to 
the youth who attempts by " brilliancy " to cover up 
any negligence in scientific research ! Still more 
intimate is the circle of the " Germanistic Kneipe," 
which comes together every Monday night at the 
" Great Elector." The group includes some of the 
most brilliant men in Berlin literary circles, as well 
as a small number of advanced students. Professor 
Schmidt is always there, even when he has to come 
late after lectures or receptions, and dominates the 
conversation, which is lively and free and darts with 
most unexpected bounds into new paths. The whole 
tone of the gatherings is that of harmless, entirely 
informal good-fellowship, and the talk is less on 
professional questions than on those of general 
interest in a highly-cultured society. Now and then 
the evening is given over to pure fun on the part of 
the students, which the Professor enters into and 
enjoys more heartily than anyone else. At Christ- 
mas-time there was a tree, with presents, poems, 
music, and a Bierzeitung ; at the close of the 
semester there was resurrected and presented an 
ancient comedy of Holberg's, with all its archaic 
accessories. Professor Schmidt's influence on the 
students is a goodly thing to witness : a free asso- 
ciation, free imparting, and the great stimulus of 
personal contact. 

A few words as to Professor Schmidt's career 
may not be unwelcome. He was born in Jena, 
where his father was a well-known professor of zo- 
ology. From his early days in the gymnasium, his 
chief interest has lain in modern German literature. 
In Strassburg he became an intimate disciple of 
Scherer. He began teaching in Wttrzburg, was for 
three years decent in Strassburg, and later became 
professor in Vienna. In 1885, when the Goethe 
archives were made public, the Grand Duchess of 
Weimar invited him, along with Loeper and Scherer, 
to take charge of them, and he has had a responsi- 
ble share in the Weimar edition of Goethe's Works. 
It was during this period, about ten years ago, that 
his discovery of Fraulein Gochhausen's copy of the 
" original " text of Faust opened up a new era in 
the criticism of that work. After the death of 



Scherer, in 1886, Professor Schmidt was called to 
Berlin to succeed that unequaled master in the field 
of the history of German literature. He is one of 
the youngest members of the Royal Academy of 
Sciences. His great work on Lessing, and his fre- 
quent essays in the field of literary investigation 
and criticism, show his fertility in production as 
well as in exposition. Personally, he is very hand- 
some : in the prime of life, with a commanding 
presence, a superb physique, and overflowing vigor 
and energy. I fancy that I recognize in him vari- 
ous points of resemblance to Goethe. A rapid, 
intense worker in the study, he allows himself to 
throw off its constraints completely and to enjoy the 
rich and varied social life which Berlin affords ; and 
he is a much-sought guest in that upper world which 
unites the leaders of society, the statesmen, thinkers, 
artists, musicians, and men of letters, and especially 
where that large group of brilliant and cultured 
women is to be encountered who lend a fineness and 
elegance to social life which are missed in regions 
where the Kneipe of the men is practically the only 
form of intercourse, but which have been a distin- 
guishing ornament of Berlin for generations. For 
music and the drama, especially, he has the liveliest 
appreciation. Like Helmholtz, he has broken com- 
pletely with the traditions of the pedantic, distraught, 
slipshod " typical " German professor, and offers an 
instance of that particularly modern type a uni- 
versity instructor of highest rank who is at the same 
time a finished man of the world in all that con- 
cerns outward appearance, sense of form, social 
facility, and address. In this may perhaps be traced 
some influence of his Vienna period. 

Probably no Germanic scholar would question 
the value and legitimacy of any of the points of 
view from which Professor Schmidt approaches the 
treatment of literature : the difficult question, as in 
most of the practical philosophy of life, is one of 
proportions. It is in his successful harmony of com- 
bination that I find most to admire. An adequate 
discussion of the whole theme would require an ex- 
act estimate of the relative treatment of the different 
factors involved. To dismiss the subject with a 
word, I would say that there is perhaps at times 
too much dwelling upon that which must be sub- 
tracted from an author before the essence of his own 
personality is to be considered. In following the 
elaborate demonstration of external sources, I have 
sometimes thought of Goethe's sharp criticism of 
Herder for venturing to mention, in a discussion of 
" The Diver," the old chronicle in which Schiller 
had found the tale. The lines laid down by Pro- 
fessor Wetz of Giessen in his interesting and sug- 
gestive tract on the study of the history of litera- 
ture, in which he maintains that the chief emphasis 
must always be laid upon the psychology of the 
author, seem to me correct. 

At a time when militarism and industrialism have 
more than ever before drawn men's thoughts away 
from the intellectual inheritance of the past, it is 
most encouraging that the perennial mission of lit-

erature in its highest and deepest sense is being so 
successfully demonstrated in the great centre of 
German civilization. Nor is this fact without its 
wholesome lesson of humility to those who have been 
entrusted with the duty of representing and expound- 
ing literature, in view of the emphasis which it lays 
upon the demand for the fullest equipment on the 
part of those who attempt to carry out this respon- 
sible task. j AMEg TAFT HATFIELD. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

DANTE AS A TONIC FOR TO-DAY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

I have been unpleasantly surprised lately at some dis- 
paraging remarks on Dante made by well-known writers. 
One of your contributors, in a recent communication to 
THE DIAL, speaks rather proudly of the fact that the 
dust on his copy of Dante is undisturbed from year to 
year; and a professor of English literature in one of 
our largest universities, lecturing on the world's great 
poets, denies (according to the statement of one of his 
students) to Dante the highest rank in poetry, the 
basis of his criticism being that the Divine Comedy is 
too grotesque and too mediaeval to appeal to the modern 
reader. 

Without desiring to enter into a (surely unnecessary) 
discussion of Dante's claims to greatness, I should like 
to indicate briefly why, contrary to the implications in 
the above remarks, the Divine Comedy is of especial 
value to-day as an antidote to many morbid tendencies 
in literature. 

1. The poem is a practical one, it is the work of an 
ardent reformer. Many of his ideas on bartering and 
corrupt politics remind us irresistibly of Dr. Parkhurst 
and the Lexow Commission. His remarks on the evils 
of indiscriminate and unrestricted immigration might 
furnish our own congressmen with arguments on this 
live question of the day. His contemptuous and indig- 
nant rebuke of the vanity of sensational preaching might 
be read, studied, and inwardly digested by many a pop- 
ular preacher of the present time. His religious ideals 
are high, and as sound as those of to-day (due allowance 
being made for the difference of the times). In many 
respects they coincide with those of Luther himself. 

2. There has been a great deal of discussion in recent 
years on the conflict between realism and idealism. It 
is interesting to note how Dante illustrates and com- 
bines both of these theories. Many of his pictures of 
Hell are repulsive almost disgusting and photo- 
graphic in their minuteness. He never hesitates to call 
a thing by its right name. He, as well as the modern 
novelists, saw the grossness of life the sensuousness, 
the lust for power and wealth, and all the meanness of 
the heart of man; yet he, unlike them, saw also the 
noble, the sweet, and the tender side of life. Balzac 
and Zola have written only Infernos ; Dante has given 
us a Purgatory and a Paradise. 

3. One of the noblest qualities of Dante is his indom- 
itable optimism, in spite of sorrows, injustice, hardships; 
and his unfailing belief in the inherent goodness of man 
and the final triumph of right. Throughout these 
scenes of sin and vice, of violence and of spiritual wick- 
edness in high places, we hear, as it were, a clear, sweet 



voice, like that in Browning's " Pippa Passes " singing 
the words, 

" God 's in his heaven, 
All 's right with the world. 1 ' 

There is no moral weakness in the Divine Comedy, no 
whining despair, none of that melancholy which brooded 
over the early nineteenth century literature, and which 
still lingers on in the form of a cynical pessimism. 

4. But the greatest of all benefits to be derived from 
the study of Dante lies in his deep and all-pervading 
spirituality. Endowed with marvellous intellectual 
power, with an ardent interest in all kinds of science 
and learning, a practical politician and man of affairs, 
he yet saw all earthly things against the background of 
eternity. No poem ever written has left the reader so 
impressed with the reality of the unseen world. Surely 
never were such lessons needed more than in the present 
materialistic age. 

I believe, with Mr. Frederic Harrison, that the lover 
of books should first of all seek to become intimate with 
the great poets in the world's literature; and I have 
endeavored to carry out this theory in my own case. 
I trust that I do not undervalue the genius and power 
of Homer, Shakespeare, Goethe, and Milton; but were 
I to be asked " What one book outside of the Bible 
would you recommend as a life-long companion, not 
merely from an intellectual or literary standpoint, but 
as a moral and spiritual aid ? " I should unhesitatingly 
answer, "The Divine Comedy of Dante." It is a de- 
lightful thing to yield to the charm of the sensuous 
beauty of Keats, to drink in the elegant music of Ten- 
nyson, to penetrate the spirit of Nature with Words- 
worth. The joy thus inspired may be compared to that 
inspired by moonlit summer nights; or by long golden 
afternoons spent beneath forest trees or in sunny glades 
touched with the magic beauty of fairy-land; or by 
those hours of quiet reflection when 

" Even the motion of our human blood 
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep 
In body, and become a living soul.'' 

But how inferior are even such elevated joys as these to 
the exultation felt by the mountain climber, when after 
long hours of toil and hardship and escape from danger, 
in which every faculty of mind and body has been called 
into action, he reaches the summit and experiences what 
Mr. Whymper calls "one glorious hour of life." Such 
is the joy, deep, lasting, ennobling, that fills the soul of 
the patient student of Dante; this is the reward of him 
who reads the Divine Comedy " with the spirit and 
with the understanding also." QgCAR KuHNS<

A DANTE SOCIETY AMONG FISHERMEN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue for June 1, the article upon " Dante in 
America " suggests the publication of an interesting 
fact. 

About San Francisco Bay is a settlement of Italian 
fishermen whose condition is apparently without an aspir- 
ation other than to have a supply of the black bread they 
eat and the sour wine they drink ; yet these people sup- 
port a society for the study of Dante. 

One wonders whether a similar organization could be 
found among English miners, for a knowledge of their 
great Shakespeare!

A HISTORY OF THE BRITISH NAVY.* 

The initial volume of Mr. Laird Clowes's 
History of the Royal Navy gives abundant 
assurance that the completed work will satis- 
factorily supply what has been a long- felt want. 
The work is planned upon a sufficiently liberal 
and comprehensive scale. It is to be divided 
into fifteen historical sections (of which six are 
included in the opening volume), each corre- 
sponding either with the duration of a dynasty, 
or of a political period, or of a great war. The 
first section covers the period previous to 1066, 
beginning with the primitive and partly conjec- 
tural maritime activities of the early Britons ; 
the second covers the Norman Age 1066 to 
1154 ; the third, the Angevin Age 1154 to 
1399 ; the fourth, the Lancastrian and Yorkist 
Age 1399 to 1485 ; the fifth, the Tudor Age 
1485 to 1603 ; the sixth, the first Stuart 
Age 1603 to 1649 ; the seventh, the time of 
the Commonwealth 1649 to 1660 ; the eighth, 
the age of the Restoration and the Revolution 
1660 to 1714 ; the ninth, the early Han- 
overian Age 1714 to 1763 ; the tenth, the 
period of American Revolution 1763 to 1793 ; 
the eleventh, the wars of the French Revolu- 
tion 1793 to 1802; the twelfth, the Napo- 
leonic and American wars 1802 to 1815 ; the 
thirteenth, the period from 1815 to the build- 
ing of the first ironclads in 1856 ; the four- 
teenth and last section, the period since 1856. 
Each section is subdivided into chapters deal- 
ing respectively with the civil and the military 
sides of British naval history and with the his- 
tory of voyages and maritime discovery during 
the period under review. The work will be 
completed in five royal octavo volumes, appear- 
ing at the rate of a volume every six months. 
The volumes are to be separately indexed. 
Warned by the example of his too sanguine 
predecessor, Sir Harris Nicolas (who undertook 
single-handed a work of considerably more than 
Gibbonian proportions, and died at the outset 
of it), Mr. Clowes has planned his book upon 
a liberal yet feasible scale, and has availed 
himself to a judicious extent of the advantages 
of cooperation. An ample corps of assistants 
has aided him in the preparatory work of mak- 
ing researches, copying documents, hunting up 
portraits, plans, and so on. Besides these sub-

altern helpers, eminent writers especially qual- 
ified for their respective tasks have aided Mr. 
Clowes in the treatment of those periods into 
the records of which his own researches have 
been confessedly relatively imperfect. Sir 
Clements Markham has contributed ten chap- 
ters on the history of voyages and discoveries 
from 1485 to present times ; the very important 
chapter on the major naval campaigns of 1763- 
1793 falls to the share of Captain A. T. Mahan 
to whom, we fancy, is mainly due the newly- 
awakened interest of our English friends in 
the comparatively neglected maritime history 
of their country ; Mr. H. W. Wilson (author 
of " Ironclads in Action ") contributes chapters 
on the history of voyages and discoveries up to 
1485, and upon that of the minor naval opera- 
tions from 1763 to 1815 (except those of the 
War of 1812) ; the story of the War of 1812 
is magnanimously entrusted to Mr. Theodore 
Roosevelt ; Mr. Edward Fraser writes the two 
chapters on the military history of the Navy, 
from 1603 to 1660. It will be noticed that 
the delicate task (Mr. Clowes's book being of 
course intended scarcely less for the use of 
American readers than of English ones) of 
treating of the periods of active hostilities be- 
tween this country and England has been 
entrusted to two American writers. On this 
point Mr. Clowes feels constrained to add a 
word or so incidentally, though he does it " a 
little unwillingly." 

" When it became known in the United States that 
my friends Captain Mahan and Mr. Theodore Roosevelt 
were to contribute to the book chapters dealing with 
our unhappy conflicts with America, a certain New York 
literary journal, which generally displays better taste, 
congratulated itself that at last English readers would 
be told the whole truth about those wars. It went on 
to insinuate with gratuitous offensiveness that, although 
Captain Mahan, being perhaps spoilt by British appre- 
ciation of his books, might hesitate to speak out, Mr. 
Roosevelt might be trusted to reflect American opinion 
in its most uncompromising form, and that I might live 
to be sorry for having secured the cooperation of that 
distinguished writer and administrator." 

Trusting that the offending journal will, " if 
only for the sake of international and personal 
comity," refrain from repeating the observa- 
tions in question, the writer goes on to say : 

" The point that struck me as being most ungenerous 
in the attack of the New York paper was the sugges- 
tion directed, not against us Britons, but against Captain 
Mahan and Mr. Roosevelt. To insinuate that one of 
these is capable of deliberately subtracting from the 
truth in order to pander to English vanity and that the 
other is capable of deliberately adorning the truth in 
order to pander to American Chauvinism, is surely to 
outrage the honor of both and to besmirch the dignity 
of American history."

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Mr. Clowes takes this matter altogether too 
seriously ; and it was certainly unwise to devote 
an entire page or more of what is meant to be 
a durable and authoritative historical work to 
a casual newspaper fling that would have other- 
wise escaped general notice. The New York 
allusion to Captain Mahan certainly seems ill- 
advised, if not ill-natured ; and it may perhaps 
be construed as hinting an opinion that that 
distinguished author has been guilty of grow- 
ing suspiciously warm over the achievements of 
British valor and seamanship, in a book whose 
success was largely conditioned upon its fav- 
orable reception at the hands of the British 
public. But it must be remembered that Captain 
Mahan is himself a seaman. He has written 
of his profession with professional enthusiasm. 
The annals of Trafalgar, Lepanto, and Mobile 
Bay, of the exploits of Nelson, De Euyter, and 
Jean Bart, of Farragut and Decatur, are alike 
the muniments of his calling. Captain Mahan 
undertook the task of demonstrating the his- 
torical glory and importance of that calling ; of 
making clear the potent influence of Sea Power 
upon history. A moment's reflection ought to 
show any American mentally above the "jingo " 
stage of patriotism that it would have been 
impossible for Captain Mahan to do justice to 
his thesis without dilating somewhat warmly 
upon the achievements of that nation whose 
annals afford him by far the most cogent proofs 
of the soundness of it that is to say, without 
producing a book that English readers would 
find especially palatable. No one conversant 
with Captain Mahan 's works, and capable of 
appreciating their characteristically candid and 
philosophical spirit, will doubt for a moment that 
his promised contribution to Mr. Clowes's book 
will be, whatever the international issues he is 
called upon to discuss, as free from the appre- 
hended tendency to " pander to British vanity," 
on the one hand, as from that to defer to Amer- 
ican " jingoism," on the other. If there be in 
England or America a writer upon whom intel- 
ligent and liberal people of both countries 
would be likely to cordially unite as a specially 
desirable expositor and judge of those issues, 
that writer is undoubtedly Captain Mahan. 

Mr. Clowes's not unrighteous indignation 
over the innuendo at Captain Mahan's expense 
leads him perhaps into some misconception of 
his critic's comfortable prediction as to Mr. 
Roosevelt. To predict that in the forthcoming 
history the honeyed words of the former would 
be duly offset by the plain truths of the latter, 
is not necessarily to brand Mr. Roosevelt as a 



" good American " of the obstreperous type so 
distressing to " The Nation," for example, or 
to insinuate that he is morally capable of re- 
garding the task entrusted to him by the con- 
fiding Mr. Clowes chiefly as a splendid oppor- 
tunity to advance his political prospects at 
home by treating his countrymen to an ener- 
getic display of " tail-twisting." Probably all 
that the New York writer meant to convey as 
to Mr. Roosevelt was his conviction that that 
plain-spoken and somewhat positive gentleman 
might safely be looked to for a more forcible 
and explicit statement of the American side of 
the standing disputes arising out of the unlooked- 
for results of the naval engagements of 1812 
than our English friends have been accustomed 
to find in the accounts of their own historians. 
That the British Navy can be worsted, is a 
proposition the average Briton finds next to 
impossible to entertain ; that the British Navy 
was worsted, disastrously and almost uniformly, 
by the American in 1812, is the plainest of 
historical facts, and is no more to be denied 
than that the French were beaten at Trafalgar, 
or, we may say (with some misgivings), than 
that the American land forces were pretty gen- 
erally and rather ignominiously beaten by the 
British at the outset of the war in question. 
The fact, then, of British naval defeat in 1812 
being sun-clear and undeniable, it has obviously 
remained for British patriotism to solace and 
reassure itself by accounting for that fact in a 
way that may not only save, but even redound 
to, the credit of the vanquished. Essentially, 
these explanations amount to the plea that in 
nearly every one of the famous sea-duels of 
1812 the British ship was at the outset so 
greatly overmatched in point of tonnage or 
armament or general condition, that, even 
though defeated, she bore off the real honors 
of the day, while her antagonist was entitled 
only to that dubious sort of glory a big or a 
strong man may claim as the victor in a phys- 
ical encounter with a small or a weak one. 
Such is the relatively comfortable view most 
English authorities incline to of the actions 
between the " United States " and the " Mace- 
donian," the " Constitution " and the " Guer- 
riere," the " Constitution " and the " Java," 
and so on. The view taken of them in England 
at the time they occurred was hardly so cheer- 
ful, judging from the tenor of some extracts 
from the press given in Mr. Maclay's interest- 
ing work. Even the " Times " seems to have 
been wrought up into a state bordering on hys- 
teria, as the tidings of successive British defeats

came in. The loss of the first frigate is an- 
nounced with grave surprise, as a passing 
instance of the inscrutable ways of Providence, 
and is duly deplored in a tone of funereal de- 
corum. But when the news of the loss of the 
second frigate came in, the " Thunderer " was 
moved to exclaim : 

" In the name of God, what was done with this im- 
mense superiority of [British] force! Oh, what a charm 
is hereby dissolved ! The land spell of the French is 
broken [alluding to Napoleon's retreat from Moscow], 
and so is our sea spell ! " 

Still deeper and more genuine is the note of 
consternation in the " Times's " comments on 
the loss of the " Java," the third frigate in suc- 
cession beaten in single fight by the vessels of 
the young Republic that had dared question 
the right of the Mistress of the Seas to rule 
her empire with the irresponsible sway of a 
Turkish pasha : 

" This is an occurrence that calls for serious reflec- 
tion this, and the fact stated in our paper of yester- 
day, that Lloyd's list contains notices of upward of five 
hundred British vessels captured in seven months by the 
Americans. Five hundred merchantmen and three fri- 
gates! Can these statements be true ? And can the 
English people hear them unmoved ? Anyone who had 
predicted such a result of the American war this time 
last year would have been treated as a madman or a 
traitor. He would have been told, if his opponents had 
condescended to argue with him, that long ere seven 
months had elapsed the American flag would have been 
swept from the seas, the contemptible navy of the United 
States annihilated, and their marine arsenals rendered 
a heap of ruins. Yet down to this moment not a single 
American frigate has struck her flag." 

It would be ungenerous to grudge our En- 
glish friends any reasonable lenitive to the 
smarts of their admitted maritime reverses of 
1812 ; but we fervently hope that Mr. Roose- 
velt, in his forthcoming chapter on those events, 
will, while doing full justice to British valor 
and seamanship (to belittle which would be to 
belittle our own achievements), at least politely 
but firmly insist, with due marshalling of admis- 
sible evidence, that the American victories were 
not on the whole, what some English writers in 
effect labor to show, rather discreditable than 
otherwise to the victors. To recur to and widen 
the application of our former Biblical illustra- 
tion, it was assuredly the navy of the infant 
Republic, not that of Great Britain, that in 
1812 paralleled the conduct of the Hebrew 
stripling who braved the might of Goliath of 
Gath. 

Mr. Clowes's work is not, of course, to be, 
what usually passes for naval history, a mere 
narrative of sea-fights. In addition to giving 
the more familiar story of military exploits and 



great voyages of exploration and discovery, it 
will deal extensively with what may be called the 
natural history of the Navy. The evolution of the 
Navy as a national establishment will be traced 
in reasonable detail, as will the development of 
naval architecture, from the pinnace (picta), 
or great British war-canoe of Caesar's day, 
down to the huge and complex constructions of 
modern times. The later chapters of the work 
are to contain copious accounts of the evolution 
of modern ships and armament. The social 
life of the Navy, a rather promising topic, will 
not be neglected. Judging from the profusion 
of interesting specimens before us, the illustra- 
tions are to be precisely what they should be 
real lights on the text, and not mere embellish- 
ments. They cannot be better or more com- 
plimentarily characterized than by likening 
them to the invaluable plates in Mrs. J. R. 
Green's admirable edition of her late husband's 
magnum opus. Mr. Clowes's undertaking is a 
very important one, largely and liberally con- 
ceived, and, thus far, carried out in a way upon 
which he and his publishers are to be warmly 
congratulated. As the only complete history 
of the British Navy, the work can scarcely fail 
of the substantial success it now bids fair to 
deserve.

AN ENGLISH BARD AND HIS SCOTCH 
EDITOR.* 



Mr. Henley's edition of the Letters of Lord 
Byron form the initial volume of what ought to 
prove a work of prime importance in its kind : 
a definitive edition or at least an amply anno- 
tated edition of the works in prose and verse 
of one of the greatest of English poets. Mr. 
Henley's purpose in writing these very full and 
excursive notes may best be set forth in his own 
words : 

" I have written on the theory that to know something 
of Byron, one should know something of the aims and 
lives and personalities of contemporary men and 
women, with something of the social and political con- 
ditions which made his triumph possible. I cannot 
believe that this first instalment, for all its bulk, will 
go far towards the accomplishment of such an end. But 
I confess to cherishing a hope that, by the time I have 
finished my task, I shall be found to have formed a col- 
lection of facts and portraitures, which, by making for a 
juster apprehension of the quality and temper of Byron's 
environment, will make for a more intimate understand- 
ing of Byron's character and Byron's achievement. Both 
these are extraordinary ; neither can be explained, or

shouted, or sniffed away ; and it is merely futile to 
attempt an estimate of either till one can do so with some 
knowledge of revelant and significant circumstances, 
and with a certain sympathy (or the reverse, if it must 
be so), with the influences under which the character 
was developed and the achievement done." 

From these prefatory remarks it is evident 
that Mr. Henley has formed a clear and bold 
conception of his duty as an editor ; and, from 
this first completed volume, it is equally evident 
that he is competent to the energetic carrying- 
out of this considerable enterprise. Indeed, 
whatever editorial defects Mr. Henley may ex- 
hibit, deficiency in energy is certainly not one 
of them. If sympathy with his author, and an 
energy and vivacity scarcely second to the en- 
ergy and vivacity of his author, were the only 
qualifications of an editor, then might Mr. 
Henley be pronounced an almost ideal editor 
of Byron. In one respect these notes to Byron's 
letters may be considered a greater achievement 
than the letters themselves. Mr. Henley in his 
notes is as far from being dull as is Byron in 
the letters. Considering how much rarer a lit- 
erary product than a body of interesting letters 
is a body of interesting notes about equal in 
bulk, Mr. Henley's performance is certainly 
remarkable, perhaps unprecedented. After 
reading one of Byron's racy letters one learns 
to turn with something like instinctive eagerness 
to the notes, which are seldom disappointing, 
after the usual manner of notes, and which fre- 
quently surprise by their fulness and apposite- 
ness of illustration. As might be expected from 
the programme laid down by Mr. Henley in his 
Preface, a large portion of the notes is devoted 
to biographical comment upon Byron's friends 
and acquaintances. The material for this por- 
tion of the notes is evidently selected for the 
illustration it furnishes of those characteristics 
in which Byron's times differ from our own, and 
it is put together with great literary skill. 

We shall look forward with unusual interest 
to the volumes of this edition which are to fol- 
low. We would not say one word that might 
tend to do aught but encourage Mr. Henley in 
his enterprise. But a Scotchman is not easily 
discouraged ; and no harm is likely to come of 
a frank statement of the defects of an editor 
who has already scored so signal a success. In 
a word, then, Mr. Henley's defect is a defect of 
temper. He annotates a passionate author pas- 
sionately. His confident and minatory attitude 
excites suspicion or irritation. He fails to treat 
persons who in any way incurred Byron's dis- 
pleasure with anything of what the French 
nicely term menagement. As an example of a 



note which is probably as untrue as it is brutal, 
take this upon Byron's mother : 

" In person she was dumpy and plain, in disposition 
passionate, in temper furious and tyrannical, in mind a 
superstitious dullard, and in manners a naturally awk- 
ward and untrained provincial." 

The notes upon Byron's sporting proclivities 
are full of curious information. In 1807, Byron 
mentions to Miss Pigot a swim of three miles 
" in the Thames from Lambeth through the two 
bridges, Westminster and Blackfriars." Mr. 
Henley notes : 

" This was Leigh Hunt's first glimpse of Byron. He 
witnessed the performance in part, and he ' noticed a 
respectable, manly-looking person, who was eying some- 
thing in the distance ' (Byron's head). The < manly- 
looking ' one was Gentleman Jackson." 

Upon this worthy there is a long and entertain- 
ing note, from which we make an excerpt or two : 
" Yet for over thirty years he was the most picture- 
esque and commanding figure in the sporting world, and 
exercised an influence unique in its annals. The truth 
is, he was a vast deal more than an accomplished boxer 
and teacher of boxing and a brilliant all-round athlete. 
He was also a man of character and integrity polite, 
agreeable, reputable, a capital talker, a person of tact 
and energy and charm. . . . Byron had always a great 
regard for Jackson ; walked with him at Cambridge, 
and told an excited remonstrant that ' Jackson's man- 
ners are infinitely superior to those of the fellows of 
my college whom I meet at the high table.' " 

After a good deal more about Jackson, the 
annotator goes on to relate how Moore went 
with him in 1818 to see the fight between Tur- 
ner and " the Nonpareil " at Crawley Downs : 
" It lasted two hours and twenty minutes, and Keats, 
who saw it, ' tapped his fingers on the window pane,' to 
give Cowden Clarke an idea of the rapidity of the Non- 
pareil's hits." 

Had Byron been in England at the time, there 
would have been three poets among the spec- 
tators. In the still longer and not less inter- 
esting note apropos of " ' Bob Gregson, P.P.' 
('Poet of Pugilism')," Mr. Henley reminds us 
that Byron was " a member of the Pugilistic 
Club one of the hundred and fifty Corin- 
thians, that is, with whose countenance and 
inside whose ropes and stakes all decent mills 
were done." This note after a long digres- 
sion containing a Scotch laird's account of a 
fight (at which Byron must have been present) 
between Cribb, the renowned " glutton," and 
Jem Belcher, " the man of genius who had re- 
inspired and renewed the art," concludes as 
follows : 

" A dreadful age, no doubt: for all its solid founda- 
tions, of faith and dogma in the Church, and of virtue 
and solvency in the State, a fierce, drunken, gambling, 
' keeping,' adulterous, high-living, hard-drinking, hard- 
hitting, brutal age. But it was Byron's; and Don Juan

and The Giaour me as naturally its outcomes as Absalom 
and Achitophel is an expression of the Restoration, and 
In Memoriam a product of Victorian England." 

It is in the note of five pages in small type 
upon Leigh Hunt that Mr. Henley gives the 
freest play to his satirical vein. For Hunt's 
book on "Lord Byron and his Contemporaries " 
there can be no forgiveness : accordingly Mr. 
Henley pursues Hunt with a ferocity which 
the good-natured Byron would himself have 
been the first, at least in his cooler moments, to 
deprecate. The reputation of Hunt is macer- 
ated in a caldron containing all the most spiteful 
things ever said about him, the whole steeped 
in the vitriol which is Mr. Henley's peculiar 
product. This " character " (as they used to 
say in the seventeenth century) concludes as 
follows : 

" It is fair to add that Hunt wrote with true piety of 
Shelley (but if, as Trelawney says, he really did pre- 
fer his own Muse before Shelley's, the density of his 
conceit is not to be expressed in terms of words) and 
Keats ; that he lived to a green old age ; that he num- 
bered Carlyle among his many friends ; and that another 
of them, Charles Dickens, was severely taken to task 
for presenting him as the Harold Skimpole of Bleak 
House. A person of parts, no doubt of parts, and a 
certain charm, and a facile, amiable, liquorish tempera- 
ment. But there was no clearer, keener vision than 
Keats's; and I fear that Keats's word about Leigh Hunt 
must be remembered as the last." 

It is evident that the fear expressed by Mr. 
Henley in the last sentence is not very distress- 
ing to him. Keats's remark that Hunt was 
" vain, egotistical, and disgusting in taste and 
morals " was probably born of a passing mood 
of suspicious irritability. That it could not 
have been his settled conviction seems to be 
shown by his friendly relations with Hunt be- 
fore and after. To quote such a remark as a 
final judgment is something more than uncrit- 
ical, it is malicious. Keats's vision was un- 
doubtedly at times clear and keen, although apt 
to be colored by his moods ; Carlyle's vision 
especially his eye for a charlatan was cer- 
tainly " clearer and keener "; and Carlyle, after 
the searching test of a house-to-house intimacy 
with Hunt for many years, wrote of him and to 
him with warm and reverent admiration. Our 
own Lowell, whose fault was certainly not lack 
of clearness and keenness of vision, found it in 
his heart to pronounce Leigh Hunt " as pure- 
minded a man as ever lived." A good rule is 
to distrust a critic of Mr. Henley's acerbity 
when he begins with a profession of fairness 
(" it is fair to add ") : it means mischief. Had 
Mr. Henley really meant to be fair, he would 
have added that Dickens earnestly disclaimed 



any intention of portraying Leigh Hunt in the 
character of Harold Skimpole. " He was in all 
public and private transactions the very soul of 
truth and honor," said Dickens. While not 
one of the masterful minds of his time, Leigh 
Hunt was one of the most educative writers. 
Few men have exhibited in the profession of 
letters more genuine heroism. Happy would it 
be for the world if some men of more vivid 
genius had set an example of equal magnan- 
imity and equal purity in the exercise of the 
literary craft. 

Even Moore, the devoted friend of Byron, 
does not wholly escape Mr. Henley's lash. His 
translation of the "Odes of Anacreon," to 
which he owed the nickname of Anacreon 
Moore, is done " as it were into scented soap." 
His " Loves of the Angels " is " a mild Whig 
Paradise, done by a tame, suburban Byron." 
As to character, " For all the smirk in his 
love-songs and the sting (as of nettles) in his 
satire, he was a worthy and magnanimous little 
man." (And such we trust, little or big, is 
Mr. Henley !) 

In Francis Jeffrey, Mr. Henley has a fair 
mark, which he hits square in the bull's-eye : 

" At the time of Byron's writing, Jeffrey, a sound 
enough critic according to his lights, had edited The 
Edinburgh Review (1802) for some ten years, and had 
made it the first periodical in the world. His chief faults 
as an editor were (1) a trick of mixing politics with criti- 
cism, so that your Tory seldom, if ever, got fair play at 
his hands; and (2) a tendency to be ' high-sniffing' and 
superior, which prevented him from considering anybody, 
or anything, excepting from his own peculiar point of 
view, which was that of a flippant (because divinely 
gifted) Whig. Hence some enormous blunders and an 
influence which made on the whole for mischief, and was 
not more bitterly resented than it deserved." 

If Mr. Henley carries out his undertaking 
in the spirit and with the verve of the present 
volume, he is likely to produce the most vivid 
and interesting body of notes with which the 
life and works of any English author have been 
illustrated. But Mr. Henley, like Byron him- 
self, has the defect of his quality. He is either 
too kindred in spirit to Byron, or else he is too 
opinionated a Scotchman, to be a critic of dis- 
crimination. He is over-vigorous, over-confi- 
dent, over-much in sympathy with his author. 
All his portraits are sharply etched in black- 
and-white, his penchant for black has been 
sufficiently exemplified. He pays court to 
Clio in much the same cavalier way in which 
John Byron paid court to Miss Gordon of 
Gight. Having possessed himself of her ma- 
terial treasures, he leaves her, little dreaming 
that the Muse of History never yields her most

force. The Truth most frequently lies in the 
nuance, the delicate distinction, the fleeting

in these your men of violence, your Byrons,

this is not to deny their usefulness, but to de- 
termine their limitation. Writers of this class

may whip us into wholesome activity with their

THE CORRESPONDENCE OF Two KINGS 
OF EGYPT, 15OO YEARS B.C.* 

Ten years ago, on the shores of the Nile, at 
Tell-el-Amarna, two hundred miles above Cairo, 
the natives accidentally happened upon a large 
number of clay tablets, containing cuneiform 
writing which had previously been found only 
on the banks of the Tigris or Euphrates.! Late 
in 1887 many of these tablets were offered for 
sale in Cairo ; and it was then discovered that 
the natives had ruthlessly broken the larger 
tablets in order to conceal and carry them more 
easily. Of their content, nothing was known. 
In the London "Academy" of February 18 
and March 24, 1888, Professor Sayce offered 
an account of some of the tablets in the pos- 
session of M. Bouriant in Cairo. He stated 
that the tablets contained " despatches sent to 
the Babylonian King by his officers in Upper 
Egypt " (sic !) ; he dated these despatches in 
the time of Nebuchadnezzar ; and added : "The 
conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, so long 
doubted, is now, therefore, become a fact of 
history." Herr Graf had already secured from 
the natives a large number of pieces of the tab- 
lets for the Royal Museum of Berlin. Of course 
the Germans soon discerned the real character 
and correct date of the letters, and the facts

1883 by Maspero, and found by the natives near the Suez Canal . 
They were stereotyped documents of Nebuchadnezzar, refer- 
ring to his western campaigns. (Cf. Sayce, Proceedings of 
the Soc. of Biblical Arch., 1887-1888, p. 490.) 



were published on May 3, 1888, in the pro- 
ceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy by 
Erman. Then for the first time the world was 
informed of the most remarkable archaeological 
discovery of modern times, being the corre- 
spondence of two kings of Egypt, Amenhotep 
III. and IV., in the fifteenth century before 
Christ (nine hundred years before Nebuchad- 
nezzar !), with various kings and officials of 
Western Asia. The names of the two Pharaohs 
written in cuneiform were identified with their 
hieroglyphic forms by Erman ; and thus at once 
it was clear why the letters were found at 
Tell-el-Amarna, the capital built by Amenho- 
tep IV. 

Such a find as this has necessarily brought 
out an extensive literature of the subject (see 
Bezold-Budge, " Tell-el-Amarna Tablets," pp. 
Ixxxvii.-xcii.) ; but it is only in Dr. Winckler's 
book on " The Tell-el-Amarna Letters " that 
all the texts have been collected and transla- 
ted. It therefore forms the most convenient 
source for this material which the historian 
can find. 

The letters, of which there are two hundred 
and ninety-six, fall into two main classes, ac- 
cording to Dr. Winckler : I., " Letters from 
Kings of Western Asia," thirty-six in number ; 
and II., " Letters from Phosnician and Canaan- 
ite Princes," two hundred and fifty-seven in 
number ; the remaining three are catalogues of 
presents. These letters are all transliterated 
carefully and accompanied by page-for-page 
translations, both occupying 404 pages. A 
series of registers at the end include : a com- 
plete vocabulary (34 pages) ; a complete list of 
proper names (8 pages) ; and a special vocab- 
ulary of the last three letters. 

The work is very well done, and every Ori- 
entalist will be grateful to Dr. Winckler for 
making this important material so conveniently 
accessible. Space will not permit any detailed 
criticism of the translations, or any account of 
the content of this remarkable correspondence. 
The translation from the German very notice- 
ably shows the influence of the German idiom, 
especially in the preface ; and a few misprints 
are also present, e. g., Rainapa for Rianapa 
(p. 337), and " loin " for loan (on p. 413).

FOCALIZED ox THE BIBLE.* 

The versatile mind and pen of Dean Farrar have 
brightened and lightened many a page within the 
past quarter- century. Biblical literature and Chris- 
tian history have received rich bequests from the 
fertility of his brain and the deftness of his hand. 
His latest volume contains a collection of some of 
his choicest thoughts on the meaning and supremacy 
of the Bible. The book contains twenty-three chap- 
ters on a wide scope of themes. But these may be 
classified as treating (1) of biblical introduction, 
(2) of methods of interpretation, (3) of the effects 
of the Bible on the lives and literature of great men. 
To one already familiar with the books of the au- 
thor, this volume contains nothing new. Its pages 
abound with references to his earlier books, and 
exhibit the same breadth of learning and fullness of 
culture. The style is strikingly Farrarian, and for 
the most wins the confidence of the reader by the 
mere force of rhetoric. The views presented are in 
the front ranks of the most progressive churchmen ; 
in fact, they often overstep the bounds of the pro- 
gressive conservative school. Too much space is 
wasted in showing the irrationality of positions long 
ago left in the rear. Even " the allegorical method" 
of interpretation now employed by no reputable 
interpreter covers nearly twenty pages. Then 
farther on in his book (p. 238), the author himself 
suggests that the allegorical interpretation of Lot's 
actions in the mountain is the most reasonable. The 
" verbal dictation " chapter (p. 104 sq.) is equally 
a skeleton of past beliefs. " Plenary inspiration " 
(p. 114 sq.) is merely a " general inspiration " such 
as inspires Christians to-day. The chapter (XVIII.) 
on the " Supremacy of the Bible " is a collation of 
the opinions of sixty-five prominent litterateurs, 
philosophers, scientists, statesmen, generals, and 
philanthropists, as gathered from their writings on 
the value of the Bible as literature and as a guide 
to right living. The whole book is peculiarly mis- 
cellaneous to be from the pen of Dean Farrar. It 
is full of good things, mingled with obsolete and 
exploded views of other days. It adds nothing to 
the wide reputation of the author, but may be the 
means of arousing and stimulating the minds of new 
readers of his works.

of Old Testament criticism is quickened to action by 
the accession of such recruits as Professor Hommel. 
This protest, though uttered in sharp terms, is com- 
paratively mild. The author does not sever his 
connection with the analyst school, for in the early 
part of his book he says, in apparent sincerity, " At 
the present time, students of the Old Testament are 
almost unanimous in recognizing the existence of four 
different main sources " of the Pentateuch, namely, 
the Priestly code, the Jehovist, the Elohist, and the 
Deuteronomist. Also in his treatment of the texts 
(e. g., Gen. 14) is reconstructed on a purely subjective 
basis, with as much positiveness as would be done by 
any disciple of Wellhausen. On the basis of style and 
language, he conceives that we can separate chapters 
and parts of chapters and assign them to their proper 
sources. The only noteworthy difference between 
the radical school and Professor Hommel lies in the 
value attached by the latter to Hebrew tradition. 
Our author traverses in the main the field of per- 
sonal names, and on the philological composition of 
these attempts to trace the origin of the language, 
the people, and the religion of old Babylonia and 
Palestine. The names in Babylonian, Egyptian, 
Arabian, and Palestinian documents are analyzed 
with a distressing amount of detail, such as can be 
followed out only by an expert in oriental learning. 
These tests precipitate for the author two important 
facts : (1) the Arabian origin of the Hammurabi 
dynasty of Babylonia and the Hyksos dynasty in 
Egypt, (2) the purely mionotheistic character of the 
early religion of Arabia there being no traces of 
either Fetishism or Totemism. The identifications, 
though often convincing, are now and then exceed- 
ingly questionable. The palaeographic methods of 
Professor Hommel in his earlier works have fore- 
warned scholars against his frequent phrases, " ab- 
solutely proved," "unquestioned," etc., appended 
sometimes to purely hypothetical cases (e. g., p. 39 
and 129, 157 top, 199 bottom, etc.). The author, 
too, dashes ahead with conjectures where caution 
should suggest silence. The material is not new, 
except in a few cases, but has received large atten- 
tion from archaeologists during the past score of 
years. The endless wrangle over the order and date 
of dynasties whose discovered remains are as yet 
mere fragments is next to a waste of time. The 
contested results are at best conjectures, and any 
scheme based thereon is insecure. The position of 
the author, in antagonizing extremists, is this : the 
Priest's Code is preexilic ; Deuteronomy was known 
to Hosea, and was not a pious fraud of Josiah's day ; 
the law and the account of its origin arose in Moses's 
day ; and the parables of Balaam and the Song of 
Deborah were contemporary documents. These 
conclusions are reached chiefly through the use of 
personal names. The book is almost wholly tech- 
nical ; it is popularly uninteresting, and of value 
only to Orientalists. It reads almost like a Hebrew 
lexicon, and will yield its best results in the fields of 
philology and ethnology. There was no gain in 
translating it into English, for all who can follow

Mr. Amos Kidder Fiske, the author of "The 
Myths of Israel," has made his debut too late in 
history. His mythical scheme for Genesis has re- 
ceived an archaeological blow from which it can 
never recover. Even admitting a documentary ori- 
gin of the book, there is still enough of archaeolog- 
ical evidence to drive him from the field. Does the 
monumental testimony set before us within the past 
quarter-century pass for nothing ? For example : he 
sees simply a legend in the fourteenth chapter of 
Genesis, " The picture of Melchisedek is a device 
for giving an ancient sanctity to Salem," etc. But 
Professors Sayce, Hommel, and others could point 
out on the monuments to Mr. Fiske the names of 
the legendary kings here mentioned, as well as con- 
firmation of some of the facts connected with the 
description of Melchisedek. A disregard of the 
best and latest results of archaeological research nul- 
lifies the value of this beautifully printed book. 

Since the appearance of the critical editions of 
the Greek text of the New Testament by Tischen- 
dorf and Wescott and Hort, scholars have had no 
up-to-date Greek Concordance. The great work of 
Bruder has served its day with distinction. Neither 
the original work nor the repaired edition of 1888 
has made it what scholars need and demand in order 
to do the most effective work in New Testament 
lexicography and exegesis. The new Concordance, 
edited by Dr. W. F. Moulton and the Rev. A. S. 
Geden will therefore be welcomed. The real author 
of the book, Mr. Geden, has done a work monu- 
mental in character and amount. He has embodied 
in this Concordance all the critical results of three 
of the best critical editions of the New Testament, 
namely, Tischendorf (8th edition), Westcott and 
Hort, and the English Revisers. The Westcott and 
Hort Greek text has been assumed as the standard, 
and with it have been compared the other two texts. 
Marginal readings also have in all cases been in- 
cluded. It is thus seen that this work includes all 
the marginal critical material of three great editions 
of the Greek New Testament. These are each indi- 
cated by appropriate abbreviations. Differences of 
reading are set forth in a line immediately beneath 
the text concerned, but to avoid unnecessary repeti- 
tion or useless bulkiness only such variations are 
noted as affect the form or construction of the word 
under consideration. Care has been exercised to 
secure in the form of the quotation, as far as pos- 
sible, grammatical completeness. Special usages 
and constructions are indicated by small prefixed 
numerals, whose significance is noted at the head of 
each article. Every attempt has been made to re- 
duce the element of personal preference in these 
cases to a minimum. Abbreviations have been em- 
ployed in the text only in the case of indeclinable 
words and of the article. Another important fea- 
ture of the Concordance is that in which the usage 
of words in the New Testament is compared with 
the Greek of the Old Testament and of classical 



writers. These variations are noted by asterisks 
and a dagger ; and are based, regarding the Sep- 
tuagint, for the most part upon the new Oxford 
Concordance. This, we do not hesitate to say, is 
the part of the work which must be tested before 
adoption. It opens a field that few scholars are 
able to enter with any great familiarity, and one in 
which fewer can put forth decisions of real value. 
Mr. Geden, however, has done his part cautiously 
and carefully, and would no doubt claim slight credit 
for originality in his announced opinions. Still one 
more point adds to the efficiency of this Concord- 
ance as a tool for New Testament workmen. " Of 
all direct quotations from the Old Testament, the 
Hebrew text is given immediately beneath the 
Greek ; occasionally also of passages in which only 
an indirect or disputed reference is present." The 
Hebrew text followed is that of Baer (as far as 
published) and Theile. But a question arises here 
which will not down, namely : Why cite the Hebrew 
text of the Old Testament, when the majority of 
the quotations in the New Testament are from the 
LXX.? Why would it not have been better to give 
us the LXX. where it agrees with the quotation, or 
the Hebrew where the same result is apparent, or 
both where neither exactly agrees? Such a pre- 
sentation would have materially aided the user of 
the book, and would have imposed no great burden 
on the editor. The volume is beautifully printed, 
with but few Greek and Hebrew accents broken off 
in the presswork. Errors are rare compared with 
the immense care necessary to secure correctness. 
The book is a boon for every biblical scholar who 

wil1 use it- IRA M. PRICE. 



BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



A doubtful 
French critic 
of America. 



" America and the Americans from 
a French Point of View" (Scribner) 
is not a very easy book to deal with, 
for it is full of sharp criticism of Americans and of 
American life. Now, where such criticism is well- 
founded, the thing to do is to get some good out of 
it ; and where it is not well-founded, the thing to do 
is to do nothing. But there is always a difficulty 
in determining whether adverse criticism is well- 
founded. It is always easy for a traveller to pick 
faults with the life he happens to observe, and 
travellers are very apt to do so. Our reception of 
a work on America is very apt to be influenced by 
the spirit in which the author observes and the sin- 
cerity with which he writes, and, it may be added, 
by the value of the positive suggestions he makes. 
In the present case there are no positive suggestions, 
so that that matter may be passed over : the author 
does not affect to be able to rearrange matters and 
make them better than they are, he merely points 
out where there are possibilities of improvement. 
Unfortunately, however, it is obvious that the writer 
got together his material with a mind quite set on 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

making the sharpest attack possible. It is true, he 
says a great deal about kindly feeling for America, 
and about the kindly manner in which he was there 
received. We have no doubt that he may have been 
received with kindness, but there is no reason to 
suppose that he has any kind feeling in return. The 
tone of the book is, from beginning to end, carping ; 
now and then it is malicious, now and then it is 
hypocritically benevolent. So one cannot think the 
book the work of an open-minded observer : it is 
the work of a man on the lookout for flaws. Nor 
is it a sincere book. Although said to be the diary 
of a Frenchman which he wrote for the pleasure of 
his sister, but which he permits to be translated at 
the suggestion of two American friends, it seems 
much more like the original work of an American. 
Without going into particulars, there is a good deal 
that seems to us inconsistent with the chosen char- 
acter. It seems to us that the author would have 
done better had he pretended he was a Russian who 
knew the English language. Since it would seem, 
then, that the book is written by someone who has 
adopted a silly mask for the pleasure of saying 
sharp things, it is hard to take just the right atti- 
tude about it. It certainly does note many points 
about our national life which deserve adverse criti- 
cism, as, for example, that we are too confident 
that machinery can do everything ; that we are too 
devoted to seeming to be busy ; that our politics are 
not worthy a great republic ; that we have too great 
admiration for money and material comfort, and so 
on. These criticisms, which we must acknowledge 
to be well-founded, though not especially new, give 
the book a sort of value. Probably, however, they 
will not have much more effect on America and the 
Americans than usually attends the efforts of an 
anonymous fault-finder. 

Dr. Otto Georg Wetterstrand is a 

Hypnotism as a o j v. u t. v. A 

curative agent. Swedish physician who has intro- 
duced into the countries of the far 
north the methods of treating disease by suggestion, 
which has been so completely and successfully de- 
veloped in the south, notably in Paris and Nancy. 
His experience with hypnotic suggestion as a thero- 
peutic agent he has recorded in a volume recently 
translated into English by Dr. H. G. Petersen, with 
the title " Hypnotism and its Application to Prac- 
tical Medicine" (Putnam). The volume is largely 
composed of extracts from a physician's case-book, 
properly classified and annotated. The claims made 
for this agency are modestly urged, and with no 
straining to exhibit it as infallible, as supernatural, 
or as a panacea. Like all legitimate forms of treat- 
ment, it has its successes and failures, is better 
adapted in some cases than in others, and is based 
upon well-recognized principles of physiological ac- 
tion. Almost the entire gamut of ills that flesh is heir 
to is represented in the record of cases successfully 
treated, from insomnia and neuralgia to paralysis 
and epilepsy ; from stuttering and neurasthenia to 
hysteria and blindness ; from anaemia and rheuma- 



tism to asthma and heart disease, on the whole, 
an array of evidence which no unprejudiced reader 
can afford to ignore. It is, however, in nervous 
complaints of functional origin that hypnotic sug- 
gestion finds its most potent application, acting in 
other troubles by influencing general conditions of 
recuperation rather than directly upon the parts 
affected. Dr. Wetterstrand allows the facts to speak 
for themselves, and indulges in no theories or strained 
explanations. He is an adherent of the Nancy 
school of hypnotism, and thus regards the essential 
nature of suggestion as a purely psychical process, 
which the physician should utilize advisedly and 
judiciously, and not leave to the ill-considered and 
pernicious manipulations of charlatans. The trans- 
lator has added to the volume a few essays on kin- 
dred topics, which detract from rather than add to 
the value of the work. His remarks on hypnotism 
and other topics are mere random observations, 
furnishing the author an opportunity of gathering 
about them quasi-philosophical discussions in which 
the scientific method is conspicuously absent. 

To the art-student and the speculator 

a?p d on art ' the 8ub 3 ect of Landscape in 

Poetry is a singularly interesting one. 
There are various ways of looking at the matter. 
The most useful way is to consider how far poetry 
can deal with landscape and how it does deal with 
it, to attempt something of the task of Lessing in 
the light of a hundred years' observation of Nature. 
The landscape of the last century, in poetry and in 
painting, is worth all the landscape in the world, in 
all preceding centuries. So if one wished to talk about 
something that would really count, one would revise 
the conclusions of the " Laokoon " in the light of Tur- 
ner and Monet on the one hand, and of Wordsworth 
and Tennyson on the other. This Mr. Palgrave has 
not done in his " Landscape in Poetry " (Macmillan). 
He remarks that "to trace landscape in colour 
through its parallel course to landscape in words 
would be a most interesting study "; but he has him- 
self been content to trace historically the sense of 
nature in the poetry of the world from Homer down. 
This treatment, we think, rather misconceives the 
subject. Nature in Poetry is one thing ; Landscape 
in Poetry is another. One may conceive of Nature 
in a philosophic way ; the word Landscape connotes 
an artistic apprehension. And the study of an 
artistic apprehension necessitates the study of pos- 
sibilities and methods, and the comparison of dif- 
ferent arts. Mr. Palgrave attempts to conceive of 
landscape philosophically ; but when he says " land- 
scape " he means what is commonly called " nature," 
though in a somewhat restricted sense. We cannot, 
however, think it right to call Wordsworth a "poet- 
landscapist," when one really means to explain his 
sense of the "pre-ordained secret harmony" be- 
tween Nature and the heart of man. Mr. Palgrave's 
view is probably of more general interest to the 
student of human thought than our own, but our 
view is the one that is interesting to the artist and

the lover of poetry as poetry. Taking his book for 
what he meant it to be, however, and not despising 
it for what it might better have been, it will be found 
a very good work on the subject. It is a little too 
much of a golden treasury of pictures in poetry, and 
too often leaves the reader to make his own general- 
izations. Still, the English reader has not anywhere 
else such a view as is here given, and Mr. Palgrave's 
book must be valued accordingly. 

m*', antiquity A 8eries of papers, varying greatly in 
in the Eastern character and value, upon the Arch- 
United state*. geology of the Eastern United States, 
by Mr. Henry C. Mercer, appear in the publications 
of the University of Pennsylvania, with the title 
" Researches upon the Antiquity of Man in the 
Delaware Valley and the Eastern United States " 
(Ginn & Co.). In the leading paper Mr. Mercer 
investigates the question of the argillite "turtle- 
back " and other rudely-chipped implements which 
Dr. Abbott claims to have found in undisturbed 
glacial gravels. He analyzes the material, showing 
that actual finding in situ is claimed for compara- 
tively few specimens. Mr. Mercer's own investiga- 
tions have yielded no truly glacial relics. On the 
other hand, they have brought to light a quarry 
where argillite was taken out, and a site where it 
was worked up into form, both plainly modern. 
Mr. Mercer, while finding no evidence of Quater- 
nary man in the Delaware Valley gravels, does find 
evidence at one site of two periods of occupancy by 
early peoples. During the older of these, argillite 
was used almost to the exclusion of chert, jasper, 
etc., in the manufacture of implements ; during the 
later, it is relatively an uncommon material. This, 
though an interesting fact, is not new. The other 
papers in this volume deal with ossuariez, shell- 
heaps, and cave exploration. The material has 
little general interest, but well deserves record. The 
present interest of the University of Pennsylvania 
in archaeology is most fortunate, and may be ex- 
pected to yield important additions to the science. 

The late Professor T. H. Green the 
"Professor Gray"of Mrs. Humphry 
Ward was unquestionably the most 
influential philosophical thinker of this generation 
in England. As an interpreter of certain of the 
great masters of the past, he pointed out the real 
nature and the bearing of the problems they were 
dealing with, and the extent and the grounds alike 
of their successes and failures, with an insight and 
skill such as we find in no professed historian of 
philosophy ; while as a constructive thinker he ranks 
among the leaders of the idealistic school. For 
these reasons, no student of the subject can afford 
to neglect his writings ; but as these are by no means 
easy reading, a connected statement of Professor 
Green's views, with the grounds on which they are 
based, will be of obvious value at least to the begin- 
ner. Such a service Mr. W. H. Fairbrother has 
aimed to perform in his volume entitled "The 



Philosophy of T. H. Green" (Macmillan). In a 
comparatively short space he has given a clear, sys- 
tematic, and accurate presentation of Green's meta- 
physical, ethical, and political theories. Some por- 
tions of the work, indeed, will hardly be intelligible 
except when read in the light of the text they are 
intended to explain. But this cannot be urged as 
an objection, since the aim of the book is distinctly 
stated to be " to help the younger student to read 
Green for himself." This useful mission it is admir- 
ably adapted to fulfil. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Both amateurs and artists interested in lithography 
will admire the handsome quarto volume entitled " Some 
Masters of Lithography " (Appleton), containing twenty- 
two representative lithographs reproduced in photogra- 
ure, with full descriptive text. The author, Mr. Atherton 
Curtis, has made such selections from the plates of the 
greatest lithographic artists as would best set forth the 
resources and the highest achievements of the art, from 
Senefelder to Gavarni. The twelve artists whose careers 
and work are presented include Ge'ricault, Bonington, 
Isabey, Delacroix, Daumier, and Raffet. These critical 
studies are the results of careful work, which has 
included the examination of over 15,000 prints at the 
Bibliotheque Nationale ; and the plates may be regarded 
as successful reproductions of the original lithographs. 

A revised and enlarged edition of Mr. W. J. Hardy's 
well-known work on " Book- Plates " is imported by 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. The number of per- 
sons interested in this subject has largely increased, says 
Mr. Hardy, since the work first appeared, in 1893; and 
these will welcome this improved edition, which con- 
tains considerable additional matter and at least one 
interesting new plate. We glean the curious bit of 
information that in America the taste for book-plates 
seems to prevail chiefly among lawyers. 

Messrs. Rand, McNally & Co. have published a trans- 
lation, made by Mrs. C. A. Kingsbury, of About's " The 
King of the Mountains." We do not recollect any pre- 
vious translation, and, if this be indeed the first, it cer- 
tainly was high time for the work to be done, for in the 
" Rod des Montagues " About is at his best, and the story 
has a perennial interest, to say nothing of its timeliness 
just now when the Greeks are getting so much attention. 
The satire of the tale is somewhat extravagant, but 
events have justified a great deal of it, and there is at 
least no doubt of the entertaining qualities of the ro- 
mance. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. are to publish an English 
translation of " The Pharaoh," a remarkable historical 
novel by Mr. Boleslaw Prus, a Polish writer. 

Volumes 2 and 3 of the report of the Venezuelan 
Boundary Commission have been issued from the Gov- 
ernment Printing Office, completing that very thorough, 
although hardly very valuable, work. 

The " Examination Bulletin " for June of the Univer- 
sity of the State of New York is devoted to the subject 
of " College-Entrance English," and is a document of 
great value to all engaged in that department of educa-

tional work. It is edited by Dr. Richard Jones, and 
contains articles by a number of competent specialists, 
as well as a great variety of specimen examination 
papers sent by colleges all over the country. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. have just published three 
of Mr. Hamlin Garland's novels in a neat uniform edi- 
tion. The titles are: " A Spoil of Office," " A Member 
of the Third House," and " Wayside Courtships." 

The " Graduate Courses " for 1897-98, just issued by 
the Macmillan Co., is the fifth annual publication of 
that useful work. It is both concise and accurate, and 
wisely conservative in its definition of " graduate " work. 

The third volume of Mrs. Martha Foote Crow's 
" Elizabethan Sonnet-Cycles " contains Michael Dray- 
ton's " Idea," Bartholomew Griffin's " Fidessa," and 
William Smith's " Chloris." The complete series will 
consist of four volumes, and is published by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. 

The first of six volumes to contain Boswell's " Life 
of Johnson," edited by Mr. Arnold Glover, is published 
by the Macmillan Co. in their Temple Classics." The 
same publishers have added Sheridan's " The School for 
Scandal," edited by Mr. G. A. Aitken, to their series of 
" Temple Dramatists." 

" The Victorian Era," by Mr. P. Anderson Graham 
(Longmans), is a well printed and richly illustrated 
book, designed for the reading of young people. It 
states briefly and clearly the history of England during 
the past sixty years, and makes an admirable gift for 
any intelligent boy or girl. 

Messrs. Small, Maynard & Company is the style of a 
new Boston publishing firm that will begin operations 
this fall. The members composing the firm are Messrs. 
Herbert Small, Laurens Maynard, and Bliss Carman, 
and the first work to bear their imprint will be a new 
edition of the works of Walt Whitman. 

Number four of the " American Colonial Tracts " 
(Humphrey) is a reprint of the " True and Historical 
Narrative of the Colony of Georgia in America," printed 
in Charlestown in 1741, for the three landholders whose 
names appear as those of the authors. It is a thick 
pamphlet of nearly a hundred pages, sold at the mod- 
erate price of twenty-five cents. 

Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole's variorum edition of the 
" Rubaiyat " will be published this fall in holiday form 
by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. of Boston. The new edi- 
tion will be revised and somewhat enlarged, and will 
contain some Danish and Italian versions, selections 
from Mr. Le Gallienne's recent translations, and a num- 
ber of drawings by Mr. E. H. Garrett. 

The ever-lengthening list of periodicals sent forth 
from the University of Chicago is now made to include 
a " Zoological Bulletin," edited by Professors Whitman 
and Wheeler. The new publication is a bi-monthly, 
and intended as a companion serial to the " Journal of 
Morphology." It will publish the shorter papers that 
do not require to be illustrated by plates. 

About twenty-five years ago Mr. Austin Dobson com- 
piled a " Handbook of English Literature " which, while 
intended primarily to assist candidates in the English 
Civil Service examinations, met with a good deal of 
success in other fields than the one for which it was 
originally planned. With the author's consent, the work 
has now been carefully revised and extended to the 
present time by Professor W. Hall Griffin of Queen's 
College, London, and published in a handsome new edi- 
tion by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co.

was deeply interested in this project, and by his will gave 
his Potomac stock for its endowment. The present agi-

maps and two hundred and twenty illustrations, reproduced from the author's drawings or from photographs. Large 
8vo. Price, $10.00. 

In presenting Sir Harry Johnston's work on " British Central Africa " the publisher believes that he is issuing a book of exceptional 
interest, not only as connected with current events, but as forming a contribution of permanent value to the study of Africa. He considers 
that in some respects this book is worthy to be ranked with Dr. Schweinfurth's "Heart of Africa," and Emin Pasha's "Journals." Conse- 
quently no expense has been spared in producing this study of British Central Africa in a manner suitable to the author's literary style and 
artistic illustrations.

THE STORY OF AB. 

By STANLEY WATERLOO. A Tale of the Time of the 
Cave Men. While the discoveries of science form 
the foundation of this work, the author has avoided 
the language of scientific exposition. Ab is a real 
man, and his people are real people, whose fortunes 
the reader follows with sympathy as keen as if they 
were of our own day, instead of children of the 
Caverns of the Earth, who lived and died ages 
before history begins. 12mo, cloth, 371 pp. $1.50 

LIKE A GALLANT LADY. 

By KATE M. CLEARY. As strong a novel of Western

its pathos with its abundant humor. Of the twelve

and five of the prototypes are living. 16mo, cloth, 
300 pp $1.25

illustrated by the quaint and original drawings of 
MAXFIELD PARRISH. Quarto, cloth . . $2.00 

THE CHOIR VISIBLE. 

By MARY M. ADAMS. The poems are bits of sentiment 
on love, nature, and the divinity of every-day life.

in his social aspect, is most exhaustively treated. 
16mo, cloth $1.25 


PAUL TRAVERS' ADVENTURES.

a boy's journey around the world, showing his mis- 
haps, privations, and ofttimes thrilling experiences,

tains twelve full-page illustrations by BERT GAS- 
SIDY. 12mo, cloth, 349 pp $1.25

specialties of singing, dancing, tableaux, and artistic 
groupings. 16 mo, cloth, 200 pp. . . . $1.00 

PIPPINS AND CHEESE. 

By ELIA W. PEATTIE. A book of stories and con-

COPELAND AND DAY 

BOOKS TO BE PUBLISHED DURING THE FALL 

FREE TO SER VE. A Tale of Colonial New York. By EMMA RAYNER. Cover designed by 

Maxfield Parish. $1.50. 

For the background of this romantic story the author has chosen a little-worked but extremely interesting time and 
place, New York in the early 18th century, when the manners and customs were part Datch and part English, with 
Indians and Frenchmen lurking in the shadows. The romance has a new scheme of plot, and hurries on through a series 
of vivid adventures in the lives of two brothers and the handmaid who is free to serve, but not to plight her troth, till 
the end of the story. A Puritan maid from New England lends a piquant contrast to her Dutch relatives, and thus all 
types of colonial Americans are on the stage. 

HARVARD EPISODES. By CHARLES M. FLANDRA.U. $1.25. 

In this book Mr. Flandrau has departed widely from the usual college story. He has, in a series of short, vivid sketches, 
drawn the modern " Harvard Man " as he is, not as he has been or as he ought to be, but truthfully as he is. The book 
does not, naturally, detail all sides of the present complex Harvard life ; but for the side which it does treat, the typical 
prosperous, happy side, it does the best thing, tells the truth, and tells it in a most delightful fashion. We feel sure 
that so accurate a picture of modern college life has not yet been drawn, and that all college men will appreciate this and 
heartily welcome the book. 

SHAD O WS. A Book of Poems. By M. A. DE WOLFE HOWE. Cloth, octavo. $1.25.

MIDDLEWAY. New England Sketches. By KATE WHITING PATCH. $1.25. 

OUT OF THE SILENCE. By JOHN VANCE CHENEY. Cloth, octavo. $1.50. 

For Mr. Cheney's new book, which presents the best poems he has written since the publication of " Wood Blooms" 
(New York, 1888), it is safe to predict the same cordial welcome that greeted his earlier volumes.

BOOKS NOW READY 

THE FAL CON OF LANGEA C. By ISABEL WHITELY. Cloth, octavo. $1.50. 

Of its kind, " The Falcon of Langeac " is one of the strongest of a year of books. Boston Courier. 

Some of the best romantic works of to-day are from the pens of those writers who go to the distant past for their inspiration and ideas. 
Of this class of writers, they are the most successful when historical knowledge enables them to tell a simple tale in which human nature 
throbs strongly, and not pedantically, amid the glamour of by-gone days, when faith was strong, and life was painted in more glowing tales 
than it can be to-day. Such a story is "The Falcon of Langeac." It is more idyllic and sweet in character than a Hope tale. . . . The 
spirit of the Middle Ages has rarely been better reflected in a story by a modern author. Worcester Daily Spy. 

NEW POEMS. By FRANCIS THOMPSON, author of Poems," etc. Cloth. $1.50. 

With one exception the poems in this, Mr. Thompson's third volume, have hitherto been uncollected. The book is larger 
than its predecessors, and the work is of equal, if not superior, quality. It may be confidently predicted that its appear- 
ance will be one of the literary events of the season in America and England. 

PATRINS. A Volume of Essays. By LOUISE IMOGEN GUINEY. Cloth, octavo. $1.25. 

A number of short essays of a speculative and whimsical character on disconnected subjects. An extract from the dedi- 
cation (to Mr. Bliss Carman) explains the curious title. " A patrin, according to George Borrow, in ' Romano Lavo-Lil,' 
is * a Gypsy trail, handf uls of leaves or grass cast by the Gypsies on the road, to denote to those behind the way which 
they have taken.' " 

The Literary World says: " 'Patrins ' is full of charm for the man or woman who knows how to read, as Miss Guiney says, ' by instinct 
and favor, for wantoness, for private adventure's sake ; and incidental profit be hanged, drawn, and quartered ! ' . . . We should like to 
quote many of Miss Guiney's clever sayings, but it is a pity to tear them from their settings. We leave them for her readers to enjoy with 
the pleasure of private discovery." 

IN TITIAN'S GARDEN. By HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD. $1.25. 

The poems here gathered are eminently representative of the author's genius. To many readers they will recall and 
justify the cordial words with which Mr. Stedman greeted one of Mrs. Spofford's earlier works. 

Few volumes of poetry have recently appeared which equal this in interest, dramatic power, and the subtle mastery of lyric forms.

BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

The rich and varied list of publications an- 
nounced for the coming season, which appears 
in the present number of THE DIAL, com- 
prises well over a thousand titles, and is the 
most extensive that we have ever published. 
To call especial attention to a few of these 
forthcoming books is a somewhat invidious 
task, except in the case of the small number 
of those whose appearance has long been await- 
ed, and which are sure to command a wide 
circle of interested readers. These, at least, 
may properly be singled out from the mass for 
special notice, and with them a few others that, 
either from the standing of their authors or on 
account of the inherent importance of their 
subject-matter, seem to deserve a word of at- 
tention in advance of their publication. But 
there will doubtless be many others, of no less 
importance, that we shall fail to mention, and 
the coming months will doubtless bring the 
usual number of surprises in the shape of im- 
portant publications that will come to our table 
unheralded. 

It is not difficult, upon this occasion, to 
name the work which will unquestionably stand 
as " the book of the year." The biography 
of Lord Tennyson, to which the son of the poet 
has devoted five years of pious toil, will appear 
on October 6, the anniversary of Tennyson's 
death. It will be a handsomely-illustrated 
work in two volumes. We cannot help regret- 
ting the rather noticeable tendency of publish- 
ers, during recent years, to produce works of 
such universal interest as this in so expensive 
a form as to place them beyond the reach of 
purchasers with modestly-lined purses. The 
authoritative life of Tennyson is a work that 
every reader will wish to possess, but that few 
will be able to acquire on account of the cost. 
Most book-lovers and literary students will 
have to go without it until the publishers see 
fit to prepare a popular edition. In this case, 
and in such others, say, as those of Dr. Nan- 
sen's book, Lowell's letters, and the life of 
J. A. Symonds, it seems ill-advised, even from 
the business standpoint, to produce them in a 
style that makes necessary a price that is almost 
prohibitive. Another case in point is that of

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



the most important book upon Richard Wag- 
ner yet produced in English. Mr. H. S. 
Chamberlain's forthcoming biography of the 
great composer is a work so necessary for the 
library of both the musical student and the 
general reader that many hearts will be made 
heavy by the price that is set upon it. In this 
case, however, our complaint is perhaps not 
wholly reasonable, for the value of the work 
(as we can testify from inspection of an ad- 
vance copy) depends largely upon the illustra- 
tions, and such plates are expensive things to 
prepare. The book will certainly be cheap at 
its price, although the fact will hardly console 
the many who cannot afford to place it upon 
their shelves. 

After naming the above two works of pre- 
eminent importance, we may call attention to 
a few others in the department of literary 
biography, history, and criticism. We are 
promised the life of Harriet Beecher Stowe, by 
Mrs. James T. Fields; the recollections of Mr. 
Aubrey de Vere; and a volume upon Thomas 
and Matthew Arnold as educators, by Sir J. G. 
Fitch. We are also to have, at last, Mr. 
Archer's translation of the important Shakes- 
pearian work of Dr. Georg Brandes. The let- 
ters of Mrs. Browning and a second series of 
letters by Victor Hugo are among the most in- 
teresting of our announcements. We must also 
mention Professor Palgrave's new " Golden 
Treasury " of modern English poetry, Dr. 
Skeat's "Chaucerian and Other Pieces" (a 
volume supplementary to the Oxford Chaucer), 
Professor Dowden'ja " French Literature," Mr. 
David Hannay's volume on " The Later Re- 
naissance," and President C. W. Eliot's col- 
lection of essays and addresses entitled " Amer- 
ican Contributions to Civilization." Mr. 
Mosher's charming reprints will appear, as 
heretofore, just before Christmas, and will add 
ten choice numbers to his catalogue. 

In the domain of pure literature, mention 
must first be made of " The Water of the 
Wondrous Isles," one of the two romances left 
by William Morris for posthumous publica- 
tion. No announcement of the other, " The 
Sundering Flood," is made as yet. American 
song will be worthily represented by Mr. E. C. 
Stedman's " Poems Now First Collected." 
The output of fiction promises to be of great 
and varied interest. Among the more import- 
ant titles are the following : " St. Ives," by 
R. L. Stevenson; " Light Shineth Through the 
Darkness," by Mr. Henryk Sienkiewicz ; 
*' Captains Courageous," by Mr. Rudyard Kip- 



ling ; " Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker," by Dr. 
S. Weir Mitchell; "The Days of Jeanne 
d'Arc," by Mrs. M. H. Catherwood; " Cor- 
leone," by Mr. Marion Crawford ; " Paris," by 
M. Zola (completing the trilogy of Lourdes, 
Rome, Paris); " Dariel, A Romance of Sur- 
rey," by Mr. R. D. Blackmore ; " The Jug- 
gler," by Miss Mary N. Murfree; " The Story 
of an Untold Love," by Mr. Paul Leicester 
Ford ; and " Three Partners ; or, The Big 
Strike on Heavy-Tree Hill," by Mr. Bret 
Harte. 

From the numerous titles belonging to 
books of the more solid and erudite classes 
we hardly know what to choose. In history, 
there are, besides some important continua- 
tions, such works as " Old Virginia and Her 
Neighbors," by Professor John Fiske ; " The 
Westward Movement," by Mr. Justin Win- 
sor ; " France under Louis XV.," by Mr. 
James Breck Perkins ; " The Evolution of 
the Aryan," by Rudolph von Ihering ; and 
"Sea Power and the Future of the United 
States," by Captain A. T. Mahan. There is 
to be a sumptuous illustrated translation of 
Pausanias, and several volumes in an import- 
ant series of " Handbooks of Archaeology and 
Antiquities." " The English Stage," by the 
acute and ingenious French critic, M. Augus- 
tin Filon, will be a very interesting book. 
" The Meaning of Education, and Other Es- 
says," by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, will 
deserve and get the attention of all educators. 
Mr. Oscar Fay Adams's " Dictionary of Am- 
erican Authors," an entirely new work, will 
be a valuable aid to the bibliographer, as will 
also the third supplement (1892-96 inclusive) 
to Poole's " Index to Periodical Literature." 



IN A VOLUME OF LOWELL'S LETTERS. 



Lowell, I never met thee while on earth ; 
Yet thou so livest in these words of thine 
That thy rich nature friendly seemeth mine 
While musing on their golden-freighted worth 
In these thou speakest, and my heart's deep dearth 
Is springing with sweet flowers, and new wine 
Of Cyprus gladdens, while o'erhead entwine 
Leafy traceries 'gainst the blue ; and mirth 
Draws smiles that soften into deeper look, 

As closer breathes thy soul's most dear aspiring 
For life beloved and finely truthful art. 
Thou yearnedst after love : grateful I took 
The hand thou openedst here, silent desiring 
Thou knewest the winning of thy reader's heart.

WHAT IS "AMERICAN STYLE"? 

In attempting dispassionately to analyze our lit- 
erary characteristics, we are met at the threshold 
by a difficult and fundamental question What is 
style ? Style is as difficult to define as it is easy to 
recognize ; but only by getting a conception of it, at 
least approximately clear, can we intelligently dis- 
cuss a distinctively national style. 

And first let us see what it is not. Style is fre- 
quently confused, to a degree at least, with subject- 
matter ; for example, it is thought that Whittier, 
having written much concerning the subject of 
Slavery, would therefore possess a distinctively 
American style. Such an opinion, however, is too 
easily susceptible of a reductio ad absurdum to be 
tenable. Keats's fruitless attempt to enter into the 
spirit of the majestic Greek myths; Corneille's in- 
ability to put into the mouth of Horace or his two 
brothers other than XVII. century Frenchisms, and 
other examples innumerable, demonstrate the im- 
possibility of reproducing the style of an author or 
a period by mere skilful use of subject-matter. It is 
true that subject-matter, in proportion as it is trivial 
or ennobling, weakens or elevates the style; but, in 
jest or earnest, the same distinctive qualities inhere. 

Nor is style dialect a proposition by no means 
so self-evident as the first. For we are accustomed 
to determine a writer's style, more or less, by his 
phraseology and trick of expression ; not only by 
his accustomed sequence of words, but by his 
methods of constructing the words themselves ; that 
is, by his " form of language," or dialect. But dia- 
lect is, essentially, local spoken language or patois ; 
written dialect being therefore only an attempt to 
reproduce that external form, the shell, rather than 
its internal essence, or kernel. This kernel, the 
true style, is what we are seeking to examine. There- 
fore, to say that the " Yankeeisms " of Lowell's 
"Biglow Papers," or the military jargon of Kip- 
ling's soldier-ballads, constitutes the one American 
or the other English national style, is to stigmatize 
our language as vulgar and ridiculous. 

It is true that the ideal style is said to be "the 
speech of the people in the mouth of the scholar," 
but it must be the rough pig-iron of the people's 
speech worked into the tempered steel of the schol- 
ar's pen, not pedantic but symmetrically simple. 
Mr. Brander Matthews struck the key-note when 
he called this "the wild flowers of speech plucked 
betimes with the dew still on them." 

But if style is neither matter nor dialect, is it 
then grammar and rhetoric ? Plainly not ; a man 
may be minutely accurate in grammar, and struc- 
turally perfect in phrase, yet lack the individuality 
of thought and facility of expression which stamp 
the hall-mark of " self " upon every sentence of an 
Emerson or a Carlyle. Clearly, then, we must go 
deeper than matter or dialect, grammar or rhetoric, 
down to the man himself. " Le style, c'est 1'homme," 
said Buffon. This definition, so terse, so strik- 
ing, so famous, is, like most epigrams, the truth, 



but not the whole truth. If by the man we mean 
the character of the man, and what else could we 
mean? character and style are not always in ac- 
cord. The gross sensuality sometimes displayed 
by Poe, the man, is strangely out of tune with the 
refined delicacy of "Anabel Lee." The weakness 
and immorality of Jean Jacques Rousseau, the man, 
make the subtle eloquence of Jean Jacques Rous- 
seau, the author, hard to explain. 

A man's style is frequently not what he is, but 
what he thinks he is. He may reverse Robert Louis 
Stevenson's description, and by a sparkling goblet 
of imagination, become temporarily a Dr. Jekyl in 
what he writes, but in character be still Mr. Hyde. 

Nor are thoughts ever the " self " alone. " Ideas 
cannot go about naked," said Bui veer Lytton. They 
must wear the apparel of the national clothing- 
house, so to speak, the garments of Race, Sur- 
roundings, and Epoch. 

It is evident, then, that style is the man, yet 
more than the man ; it is the dynamic of the ma- 
chine, whose parts are the material characteristics 
into which language can be analyzed. 

From another point of view, Lowell defines it 
charmingly, but in a fashion too poetic to be scien- 
tifically exact, as "that exquisite something called 
Style, which makes itself felt by the skill with 
which it effaces itself, and masters us at last with 
a sense of indefinable completeness." 

Having attempted to reach some comprehension 
of what style is, viewed from the standpoint of the 
scientist and of the poet, we are next led to inquire 
what, if there be such a thing, is a national style? 
This has been defined as "an average style de- 
duced from the examination of many or most of a 
nation's authors"; but such a definition is super- 
ficial. If a style is personal, it partakes of the 
character of the person, as evidenced in his daily 
life. If a style is national, it partakes of the 
character of the nation as evidenced in its daily 
life. In other words, it is not the " average of the 
best styles " which constitutes a national style, but 
it is rather the style of those who, be they great 
or small, most truly voice the national character. 

There is as much individuality in a nation as 
there is in an individual. If we can analyze these 
national characteristics, and, taking them as a test, 
try the writers of a nation by them, we shall arrive 
thus, and only thus, at a true conception of the lit- 
erary style of that nation. 

Let us take the French as an example. For a 
just, even though a French, analysis of their psy- 
chological process, let us turn to Taine: "When 
the Frenchman conceives an event or an object, 
he conceives quickly and distinctly. ... At once 
and without effort he seizes upon his idea. But he 
seizes that alone. ... He is only moved super- 
ficially; he is without large sympathy; he does not 
perceive an object as it is, complex and combined, 
but in part, with a discursive and superficial knowl- 



The style that could be called "distinctively 



140 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



French " would be, speaking broadly, that possess- 
ing the characteristics described above. 

So, in solving the problem of a distinctively 
American style, we would first ask ourselves 
whether there is a distinctively American charac- 
ter, and if so what are its essentials. That there 
is, universal opinion attests. From England to 
Japan, from Norway to the Cape of Good Hope, 
none is so easily recognizable as the American type. 
Though Englishmen, at least sensible Englishmen, 
have ceased to expect the typical American to pass 
his waking hours and, for that matter, most of 
his sleeping hours with trousers in boots and 
pistols in belt, Jonathan has still every whit as 
much individuality as John. 

What are the forces whose resultant is this indi- 
viduality ? In so far as I can analyze them, they are : 

1. The youthf ulness of the national life. From 
this youthfulness comes, naturally enough, a cer- 
tain intensity and rush of life, characteristic of all 
youth, which tends to make us lacking in precision, 
careless of detail, somewhat superficial in reasoning, 
quick to grasp but weak to hold. 

2. Democracy. Our intensely democratic feel- 
ing engenders self-respect and self-sufficiency; a 
breadth, though not a depth, of view ; independ- 
ence and disrespect for old institutions ; and a lack 
of that conservatism which should subordinate the 
warm heart to the cool head. 

3. Heterogeneity. We are a hybrid nation,|and 
though pride of birth is sometimes a correcting and 
restraining influence, the consciousness of our some- 
what hazy lineage tends to destroy prejudice and 
render us cosmopolitan and broad. 

4. Natural variety. No other people on the face 
of the globe can see greater contrasts of scenery, 
greater extremes of climate, or greater varieties of 
products, than those who dwell between the Great 
Lakes and the Rio Grande, the Atlantic and the 
Pacific oceans. This engenders a bold, free, broad 
conception of nature, an intense appreciation of 
her various moods, and an expression of those 
moods excelling that of any other nation in its un- 
trammelled artlessness. Here, nature is young, as 
well as we ; sometimes she is stately and grand, with 
all the self-conscious dignity of young womanhood ; 
sometimes she is impetuous, effervescent, sparkling, 
and free, with the memory of her childhood, un- 
touched by human artificiality, still vivid ; but in 
whatever mood she be, we have had and still have 
poets to appreciate and express her. 

These, then, are the forces, these the effects, 
observable in our national character. If there be 
any other nation having these same characteristics, 
and writers to express them, distinctively American 
style is an impossibility. But it needs no argu- 
ment to show that no other nation is the resultant 
of such forces in such proportions. Wherever, there- 
fore, we can find within our borders prose or poetry 
having such characteristics as have been enumerated, 
we shall have found a distinctively American style.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

SOME QUESTIONS OF GERMAN TRANSLATION. 
(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

In your issue of July 16, Mr. Thomas Common of 
Glasgow, whose translation of Nietzsche's Works I re- 
viewed in an earlier issue, claims that my criticism of 
his translation is altogether unfair; that I dealt out my 
blame of it " in a great hurry "; that the errors I adduce 
are no errors at all " except in the imagination of a per- 
son in a flurried state of mind." It hence becomes my 
unpleasant duty to show why I was bound to regard 
this translation as " bad throughout, and in parts igno- 
minious." 

First, as regards the four errors I quoted. I, for one, 
am offended by a construction like " in his art there is 
mixed . . . the things," etc. I am, however, willing to 
yield to higher authority, aud admit that on that point 
I was over-severe. But to translate " Die Romane Dos- 
toiewsky's " (Vol. VIII., p. 48 of the German edition) 
by "the romances of Dostoiewsky" shows a lack of 
linguistic sensitiveness. Dostoiewsky's works are not 
romances, they are distinctly novels. No one ever 
spoke of Flaubert's " Madame Borary " or Zola's " La 
Terre " as " romances," though he might apply that term 
to " Guy Mannering " or to Me'rime'e's " Colomba." 
Similarly, to translate sick verbieten " (p. 38) by " pro- 
hibit oneself " is awkward. All these translations are, 
however, excusable compared with Mr. Common's ren- 
dering of " ich weiss nicht aus noch ein " (p. 217) by " I do 
not know out or in." Mr. Common naively calls this 
" a metaphor," and says: " I am blamed for preserving 
a metaphor by translating it literally, though not ob- 
scurely. Besides preserving the metaphor, the literal 
rendering seems best suited to the context." " Ich weiss 
nicht aus noch ein " is an idiomatic phrase which every 
German understands. " I know not out or in " is no 
English at all, and is totally unintelligible. 

These last three passages are, however, not the only 
ones open to criticism. The book is freckled with bits 
of bad translation. I subjoin a list, which, for lack of 
space, cannot lay claim to completeness. 

Page 61. "I have my readers everywhere. . . . / 
have not them in Germany." 

Page 73. " A God who is quite specially a God for the 
sick." This to me is an exceedingly awkward rendering 
of the German " ganz eigentlich ein Gott" etc. 

Page 73. " Understandableness " (" begriffliche Ver- 
standlichkeit "). 

Page 74. "Where Wagner belongs to." (If that 
phrase can be proved correct on the authority of some 
" higher grammar," then we may be justified in asking 
" Where are we AT ? ") 

Page 101. "The trodden worm turns himself" (for 
" writhes "; " krummt sich "). 

Page 145. " The distinguished Germanics " (the 
original is " die vornehmen Germanen" " Germanics " 
signifies the study of German language and literature, 
but not the people of Germany, and does not correspond 
to " Germanen " over against " Deutsche "). 

Page 189. "Ring of the chain" for "link in the 
chain " ( Ring der Kette "). 

Page 210. " The Siberian convicts, in whose midst he 
lived." Let us hope he lived among them, and not " in 
their midst," for that might have injured them more 
than all the hardships of convict life. Of course, the 
translator was misled by the German " in deren Mitte." 

Page 350. "Healthiness." "Health" would have

been the more natural word, especially as it is grouped 
with "beauty." 

These samples of Mr. Common's method of transla- 
tion will suffice to show that he must have worked care- 
lessly and in haste, and that he lacks literary sense. 
Furthermore, he seems not sufficiently to master German 
to understand thoroughly idiomatic constructions.

A JAPANESE MAGAZINE OF FOREIGN 

LANGUAGES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I beg leave to call your attention to one more 
manifestation of the broad spirit which now prevails in 
this empire with reference to the necessity of a better 
knowledge of foreign things. Another magazine has 
just been launched on the crowded sea of journalism ; 
it is called " Gwaikoku Gogaku Zasshi," or " Foreign 
Language Magazine." Its object is to assist students 
to acquire English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, 
Russian, Chinese, and Korean. The first number con- 
tains exactly 200 pages in the body of the work ; the 
table of contents, printed in each of these languages, 
occupies eight pages ; and there are several pages of 
advertisements in both Japanese and English. It is 
published by the Hakubunkwan, Tokyo, and sells at 25 
sen a copy, or 2.70 yen per year. The first edition of 
6,000 was exhausted at once ; and a second edition is in 
print. A cursory examination of the English portion 
reveals comparatively few mistakes or misprints, and 
indicates that, in general, the work has been well done. 

The English section takes up more than half the 
issue ; the German section occupies one-fifth ; the 
French section not quite one-tenth ; the Russian, 
Italian and Spanish sections four pages each ; and the 
Chinese and Korean sections six pages each. The con- 
tents include lessons, conversations, letters, news items, 
current events, extracts from literature, essays, poems, 
etc. Each language is taught under such headings as 
the following : " Pronunciation, conversation, gram- 
mar, composition, translation, reading matter, current 
notes, etc." There are also illustrations, including one 
of Queen Victoria. The editor-in-chief is Mr. S. 
Ohashi, who is assisted in each department by a special- 
ist (a Japanese) in that language. The Spanish sec- 
tion, however, is under the supervision of Prof. Emilio 
Binda. The publisher's note speaks of " the import- 
ance to our people of all these languages, whether 
considered from political, educational, commercial, or 
any other point of view " ; and also says that, " as 
mixed residence will soon be a matter of reality," " the 
study of foreign languages is, therefore, of urgent 
necessity." ERNEST W. CLEMENT.

THE LACK OF SCIENTIFIC WORK IN RHETORIC. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL. ) 

The inadequacy of recent books on rhetoric, and the 
generally feeble and unscientific way in which the sub- 
ject is at present taught in our schools and colleges, 
seem to me to call for comment and for protest. If 
we may judge from their writings, many authors of 
text-books on this subject neither conceive the pos- 
sibility nor appreciate the desirability of a Rhetoric 
having its basis in definitely known psychological 
principles, studies of development of language power 



in race and individual, and in perfected methods of 
investigation. The science of rhetoric is fifty to a 
hundred years behind economics and psychology, and 
in many respects its present condition is like the ear- 
lier stages of these and other sciences. The work 
of each writer is generally unadvantageously individ- 
ual in some respects each author usually attempt- 
ing to cover the whole field of the subject. There 
also is much less division of labor and intelligent co- 
operation than in a highly developed science. Such is 
the necessary result of the comparative absence of scien- 
tific methods methods capable of being accurately 
described and criticised, thus rendering the results 
verifiable and making it possible rationally to estimate 
their value. The broader generalizations from which 
each author makes his deductions, as in the abstract 
economics and the old psychology, are reached by pro- 
cesses of which the authors themselves are not clearly 
conscious. Although philology, sociology, and psycho- 
logy stand ready to make contributions of methods and 
conclusions, students of rhetoric have been much slower 
than students of more progressive sciences to avail them- 
selves of such aid. How many college text-books treat 
general principles at all adequately ? In how many pop- 
ular texts do we find expositions of the real nature of 
language power, its relation to mental development and 
to ultimate aims in life, and of its value to human 
society ? The broader ethical, aesthetic, and social im- 
ports of the power of verbal expression are generally 
ignored. An occasional reference to commercial utility, 
and appeals to class pride or ambition, are frequently 
the only references to any rational aim in the science. 

Notwithstanding various merits of some recent works, 
and that some are in part to be excepted from these 
criticisms, there is a very real need of a science of 
rhetoric employing the methods of modern sciences.

PATRINS." 

["Patrins" (the title of Miss Louise Imogen Guiney's charming 
book) is a word signifying the trails of Gypsies, who scatter handfuls 
of leaves or grass along their path to show the way to those who follow.] 

This way she went, with Iris for her guide, 
Through beds of mint along the meadow-side; 
The scattered sprigs, dropt idly from her palm, 
With their bruised leaves fill all the air with balm. 

Here lies her track upon the uplands dun, 
Where the wild berries ripen in the sun; 
The brown bees follow, drinking at their will 
From brimming cups that half their nectar spill. 

This way she passed, for at the crossing see 
A messenger, new come from Arcady, 
Leading an elfin troop that wait to dine 
On cates and honey at the thistle's sign. 

Here was her camp-fire : from its embers gray 
A faint blue smoke steals upwards and away; 
Here with great Pan in converse gay she stood, 
And strolled with Dian through the scented wood. 

O happy vagrant, singing as you pass, 
Drop still your trail of bloom across the grass; 
Pitch y9ur white tent, and in some cool retreat 
Wait with a welcome for our slower feet.

A PENDANT TO BOSWEL.L,.* 

In the preface to his edition of the " Letters 
of Samuel Johnson " Dr. George Birkbeck Hill 
expresses the hope that he may live to complete 
the main work of his life as a scholar by a new 
edition of the " Lives of the Poets." From 
this projected task he has been turned aside, 
temporarily, as we trust, by a suggestion from 
Mr, Leslie Stephen to edit all those writ- 
ings which have long been included under the 
general title of " Johnsoniana." The fruit of 
Mr. Stephen's happy proposal now lies before 
us two beautiful volumes, at all points such 
as the nice judgment of their lamented pro- 
moter would have approved of, elucidated and 
enriched editorially as only Dr. Birkbeck Hill 
could have done it. The work contains nearly 
everything worth reading (outside of Boswell) 
that has been written about, or that is trust- 
worthily recorded as having been said about, 
the Sage of Bolt Court by people who knew 
him in life, besides certain matter of an auto- 
biographical character or interest from the 
hand of the great man himself. Dr. Hill has 
not, of course, been able to offer much that is 
new or even tolerably unfamiliar in the way of 
Johnsonian lore ; but he has put the old in the 
best possible shape for reading or for reference. 
The main omission is Madame D'Arblay's 
" Diary," from which he had at first thought 
of giving extracts, but which, he concluded 
after reflection, " is too good a piece of work 
to be hacked in pieces." Readers, therefore, 
who would fain know "gay Sam, agreeable 
Sam, pleasant Sam," as contra-distinguished 
from the more familiar brusque Sam, overbear- 
ing Sam, Sam of the dingy linen and the sting- 
ing retort discourteous, must still turn mainly 
to " Burney's " sprightly pages. Miss Seward's 
" Letters " have been passed over by Dr. Hill 
as untrustworthy. Some slight additions have 
been made to the hitherto general stock of 
Johnsoniana. By collating the text of " Prayers 
and Meditations," with the original manuscript 
preserved at Pembroke College, Dr. Hill has 
been enabled to make some corrections and to 
supply some omissions. Certain defects and 
omissions in Croker's edition of Miss Rey- 
nolds's " Recollections of Dr. Johnson " have 
also been rectified and supplied, Dr. Hill hav-

ing been entrusted, to that end, with the MSS., 
by their present owner, Lady Colomb, a de- 
scendant of Sir Joshua's sister, Mary. Some 
letters which Croker had not seen or had passed 
over are now printed for the first time, as well 
as the corrections made by the Doctor in 
" Renny's " verses when he " mended some bad 
rhymes." To the rich collection of "Johnson- 
iana " owned by Mr. Robert B. Adam, of 
Buffalo, N. Y., Dr. Hill warmly expresses his 
indebtedness. Several hitherto unpublished 
letters to and from Dr. Johnson are added 
through the kindness of the owners of the 
originals.* 

Dr. Hill's opening volume is devoted to the 
longer pieces, including the "Prayers and 
Meditations," printed with George Strahan's 
Preface to his first edition, of 1785 ; Dr. John- 
son's " Annals " of his life up to his eleventh 
year ; Mrs. Piozzi's " Anecdotes "; and Arthur 
Murphy's " Essays on Johnson's Life and 
Genius." Volume II. forms a rich storehouse 
of Johnsonian miscellany. There is a great 
array of " Anecdotes," and a collection of let- 
ters most of which are now printed for the first 
time ; there are Apophthegms from Hawkins's 
edition of Johnson, Extracts from Boswell's 
Letters to Malone, and the " Recollections " of 
Miss Reynolds ; there are Hoole's and Wind- 
ham's narratives of Johnson's closing days ; 
there is the Biographical Sketch by Tyers ; 
there are two papers by Reynolds, on Johnson's 
" Character " and on his " Influence," together 
with the genial painter's two capital " Dia- 
logues in Imitation of Johnson's Style of Con- 
versation." Among the letters given we note 
an interesting one (from the collection of Mr. 
Adam) setting forth Dr. Johnson's views on 
literary property. It is dated March 7, 1774, 
and was written, as Dr. Hill surmises, to 
William Strahan.

resigning some part of his natural right, the authour 
must recede from so much of his claim as shall be

without any inconvenience be protracted beyond the 
term settled by the Statute. And it is, I think, to be 
desired (1) That an Authour should retain during his 
life the sole right of printing and selling his work. This 
is agreeable to moral right, and not inconvenient to the 
publick, for who will be so diligent as the authour to 
improve the book, and who can know so well how to 
improve it ? (2) That the authour be allowed, as by 
the present act [8th of Queen Anne], to alienate his 
right only for fourteen years. A shorter time would 
not procure a sufficient price, and a longer would cut 
off all hope of future profit, and consequently all solici- 
tude for correction or addition. (3) That when after 
fourteen years the copy shall revert to the authour, he 
be allowed to alienate it again only for seven years at a 
time. After fourteen years the value of the work will 
be known, and it will be no longer bought at hazard. 
Seven years of possession will therefore have an assign- 
able price. It is proper that the authour be always 
incited to polish and improve his work, by that prospect 
of accruing interest which those shorter periods of alien- 
ation will afford. (4) That after the authour's death 
his work should continue an exclusive property capable 
of bequest and inheritance, and of conveyance by gift 
or sale for thirty years. By these regulations a book 
may continue the property of the authour, or of those 
who claim from him, about fifty years, a term sufficient 
to reward the writer without any loss to the publick. In 
fifty years far the greater number of books are forgotten 
and annihilated, and it is for the advantage of learning 
that those which fifty years have not destroyed should 
become bona communia, to be used by every Scholar as 
he shall think best. In fifty years every book begins to 
require notes either to explain forgotten allusions and 
obsolete words; or to subjoin those discoveries which 
have been made by the gradual advancement of knowl- 
edge ; or to correct those mistakes which time may have 
discovered. Such Notes cannot be written to any useful 
purpose without the text, and the text will frequently 
be refused while it is any man's property." 

One of the more unfamiliar anecdotes, tell- 
ing of an amusing rencontre between the Doctor 
and Gilbert Stuart, the American painter, at 
that time studying under Benjamin West, is 
taken from Stuart's " History of the Rise of 
the Arts of Design in the United States." 

" Dr. Johnson called one morning on Mr. West to 
converse with him on American affairs. After some time 
Mr. West said that he had a young American (Gilbert 
Stuart) living with him, from whom he might derive 
some information, and introduced Stuart. The conver- 
sation continued (Stuart being thus invited to take a 
part in it), when the Doctor observed to Mr. West that 
the young man spoke very good English; and turning 
to Stuart rudely asked him where he had learned it. 
Stuart very promptly replied, Sir, I can better tell you 
where I did not learn it it was not from your diction- 
ary.' Johnson seemed aware of his own abruptness, and 
was not offended." 

Dr. Birkbeck Hill has, as usual, enriched his

THE LITERARY HISTORY OF THE 
AMERICAN REVOLUTION.* 



In the work that he originally entitled " The 
History of American Literature," Professor 
Moses Coit Tyler undertook " to examine the 
entire mass of American writings during the 
Colonial period so far as they now exist in the 
public and private libraries of the country," 
even to the extent of " making an appropriate 
mention of every one of our early authors whose 
writings, whether many or few, have any appre- 
ciable literary merit, or throw any helpful light 
upon the evolution of thought and style during 
those flourishing and indispensable days "; and 
to present all the valuable fruits of his exami- 
nation in such literary form as would commend 
them to the public favor. How well he succeeded 
in this arduous undertaking is shown by the 
place that the work has steadily held during 
the almost score of years that have elapsed 
since its publication. Professor Tyler, how- 
ever, did not abandon the child of his study at 
its birth, but has continued to watch over it, 
remedying its defects as he discovered them or 
they were pointed out to him, until he has now 
presented us with a revised and improved edi- 
tion, bearing a title somewhat changed. But, 
what is more to our present purpose, he also 
gives us the first volume of a new work, or 
perhaps it would be better to say an extension 
of the old one ; for his original scheme, as he 
first described it, embraced "the history of 
American literature from the earliest English 
settlements in this country down to the present 
time." The language of this avowal suggests 
a still greater literary scheme, the author of

which never lived to complete it ; but we may 
hope that to Professor Tyler will be accorded 
a happier lot. 

In " The Literary History of the American 
Revolution " Professor Tyler attempts a thing 
before unattempted, so far as we are aware, to 
say nothing of performance. It will be well to 
let him state the case in his own words : 

" There would, perhaps, be no injustice in describing 
this book as the product of a new method, at least of a 
method never before so fully applied in the critical 
treatment of the American Revolution. The outward 
history of that famous procedure has been many times 
written, and is now, by a new breed of American scholars, 
being freshly rewritten in the light of larger evidence, 
and under the direction of a more disinterested and a 
more judicial spirit. In the present work, for the first 
time in a systematic and a fairly complete way, is set 
forth the inward history of our Revolution the his- 
tory of its ideas, its spiritual moods, its motives, its pas- 
sions, even of its sportive caprices and its whims, as 
these uttered themselves at the time, whether con- 
sciously or not, in the various writings of the two parties 
of Americans who promoted or resisted that great 
movement. 

" The plan of the author has been to let both parties 
in the controversy the Whigs and the Tories, the 
Revolutionists and the Loyalists tell their own story 
freely in their own way, and without either of them 
being liable, at our hands, to posthumous outrage in the 
shape of partisan imputations on their sincerity, their 
magnanimity, their patriotism, or their courage. More- 
over, for the purpose of historic interpretation, the au- 
thor has recognized the value of the lighter, as well as 
of the graver, forms of literature, and consequently has 
here given full room to the lyrical, the humorous, and 
the satirical aspects of our Revolutionary record its 
songs, ballads, sarcasms, its literary facetice. The entire 
body of American writings, from 1763 to 1783, whether 
serious or mirthful, in prose or in verse, is here deline- 
ated in its most characteristic examples, for the purpose 
of exhibiting the several stages of thought and emotion 
through which the American people passed during the 
two decades of the struggle which resulted in our na- 
tional Independence." 

The older writers dealt almost wholly with the 
political and military aspects of the Revolu- 
tion ; some of the younger ones have widened 
the view, taking in economical, social, and other 
factors ; but it remained for Professor Tyler to 
conceive and execute a work that is exclusively 
devoted to the subjective or spiritual factors of 
the period as they are expressed in literature. 
Professor Tyler first teaches us to " distin- 
guish between those writings which were the re- 
sult of certain general intellectual interests and 
tendencies, apart from the Revolutionary move- 
ment ; and, secondly, those writings which were 
the result of intellectual interests and activities 
directly awakened and sustained by that move- 
ment." The writings of the second class, which 
give the period its character, he divides as fol- 



lows : Correspondence, State papers, oral ad- 
dresses, secular and sacred, political essays, 
political satires in verse, popular lyric poetry, 
minor literary facetice, dramatic compositions, 
prose narratives of actual experiences, indi- 
vidual or collective. This classification, how- 
ever, does not impose upon him his method of 
treatment, for he chiefly holds to historical se- 
quence, the very " order of time whenever they 
severally came into life, and wrought their work 
in the world, thus permitting the principal 
members of those different groups of literature 
to appear upon these pages and to unfold their 
message to us somewhat as they actually made 
their first appearance in the successive scenes 
of that great transaction in which they were so 
significant a part." Again, his purpose is not 
so much to call attention to the independent 
artistic value of these writings as to their hu- 
manistic and historic value. 

These are the main lines of the work, and 
surely it is necessary only to draw them to indi- 
cate at least the great value of a well-educated 
work that should follow them out. Professor 
Tyler has given us the first volume of such a 
work, in more than five hundred pages, with a 
promise of a companion volume that shall bring 
the story down to the close of the war. 

The new work has the qualities of the earlier 
one : thorough research, judicious handling of 
materials, and a clear, vigorous, pleasing style, 
dashed with plenty of the writer's personality. 
As in the earlier work, it is not always easy to 
see in a writer or in a writing all that Professor 
Tyler sees in it. But this fact gives us no 
offence. This is a case where an author is not 
only permitted but expected to imitate the good 
bishop in magnifying his office. In other words, 
an enthusiasm born of the/acA is required in 
order to see and write the history of American 
literature down to 1783 as large as Professor 
Tyler sees and writes it. 

The work offers many interesting points for 
discussion, and we shall draw attention to one 
of them. It does full justice to the Loyalists, 
both in the amount of space that is devoted to 
them five full chapters, to say nothing of 
frequent occasional mention, and in the view 
that is taken of their attitude toward the great 
questions of the period. At the close of one of 
these chapters the writer corrects what he calls 
" three grave errors closely connected with the 
whole subject, and still prevalent in popular 
American expositions of it." These errors are 
(1) " to represent the Tories of the American 
Revolution as a party of mere negation and

obstruction "; (2) to represent them " as a 
party opposed either to any reform in the rela- 
tions of the colonies with the mother country, 
or to the extension of human rights and liber- 
ties here or elsewhere "; (3) to represent them 
" as composed of Americans lacking in love for 
their native country, or in zeal for its liberty, 
or in unwillingness to labor or fight, or even 
to die, for what they conceived to be its inter- 
ests." While it is impossible for any man 
holding the traditionary view to accept this 
criticism, historical investigation is neverthe- 
less leading us to it slowly but irresistibly. 
Professor Tyler goes so far, as we understand 
him, as to yield the old contention that the 
course pursued by the British Parliament in 
taxing America contravened the ancient prin- 
ciple of no taxation without representation. At 
the same time, we understand him to be a good 
American patriot and a believer in the Amer- 
ican Revolution. What is by no means uni- 
versal now among American scholars and his- 
torians, he maintains that the two central 
charges of the Declaration of Independence 
were true, namely, that the ministerial policy, 
which was the royal policy, evinced a design to 
reduce the Americans under absolute despot- 
ism, and had as its direct object the establish- 
ment of an absolute tyranny over them. In 
fact, his view of the Declaration is altogether 
more enthusiastic than the one we sometimes 
find American historical scholars upholding. 
How, then, does Professor Tyler reconcile his 
high estimate both of the Loyalists and of 
Thomas Jefferson? 

This question brings us to what we consider, 
logically speaking, the greatest defect of the 
book. This is the failure anywhere to present, 
so far as we have observed, a consistent general 
statement of the author's own theory of the 
Revolution. No doubt he has such a theory. 
Perhaps, too, the well-read student will be able 
to extract this theory from scattered passages 
in the volume ; but this student should not 
have been put to this labor, or the less well- 
equipped reader exposed to the hazard of mis- 
conceiving the author's meaning, as is now the 
case. Perhaps Professor Tyler holds in reserve 
a statement of the lines of argument on which 
he vindicates the Revolution. We sincerely 
hope such is the case. 

In one view, the American Revolution was 
one of the tragedies of history. As though it 
were not enough to put asunder two peoples of 
a common origin that had many reasons for 
working out their destiny together, it ruthlessly 



divided the younger of these peoples into two 
not very unequal and altogether implacable 
factions, ending in the complete suppression 
or extirpation of the weaker one. When one 
witnesses the qualities of mind, culture, and 
character that the American Loyalists show in 
Professor Tyler's History, and contemplates the 
prosperous communities they established in the 
great nation to the north of us, he recalls the 
curse that William of Orange, as he beheld in 
battle the splendid valor of the Irish regiments 
in the French army, pronounced upon the 
cruel fate that had denied to him the services 
of such soldiers. B A HINSDALE. 



NOTHING BUT LEAVES.* 



" Patrins " are bunches of leaves by which 
Miss Guiney shows the path she has taken. On 
the whole, however, it is a pity that she should 
not have marked her path with great sign- 
boards, so that it might be avoided. It is a 
dangerous path : Miss Guiney may have trod- 
den it in safety, but there have been many and 
there will be many who have tried to follow it 
without success. To speak directly, we dissent 
from the attitude in life commended by Miss 
Guiney. 

For instance, the scholar, to her mind, is one 
who knows already all he wants to, and goes 
about smilingly diffusing the scorn of education, 
" conversing consumedly about the weather "; 
the " out-of-doorling " does not do anything while 
he is out-of-doors, but " simply moves or sits in 
eternal amalgamation with the eternal." Now, 
though everyone knows that there is some sense 
in the attitude which Miss Guiney has in mind, 
it must also be plain that for one who can attain 
a sensible state to be humorously described as 
above, there will be a thousand Miss Nancies, 
Willieboys, and absolutely imbecile chumps, 
who are rejoiced at such an opportunity for 
mere blatant assumption. And these nonenti- 
ties, who hope that they will be thought some- 
thing of by dint of doing nothing, are an awful 
bore of which we have already too many. 

" The oddest and choicest of social attitudes," 
says Miss Guiney, is an attitude of sacred 
indifference. For heaven's sake, do n't strive 
or cry, do n't think anything or do anything 
(it 's so easy to be commonplace), keep your-

self out of the stupid turmoil of life. It is true 
you must n't fall into anything so foolish as the 
" cheap indifferentism so called ; the sickness 
of sophomores ": you must be something more 
distinguished, something like Lucius Gary, 
Viscount Falkland. Now, of course, there is 
a fine indifference to foolish things, as well as 
a foolish indifference to fine things and foolish 
things alike. And equally, of course, Miss 
Guiney has somewhere in mind the hope that 
she has really got the right article. But, not 
to be personal, we do not think she has. Her 
essays not only have no backbone and no other 
bones, but they have no vitals and no breath of 
life. It may be more vulgar, but we should 
prefer a man who, if a scholar, would always 
gladly learn and gladly teach, and who knew 
what was worth learning and teaching and 
what was not ; we prefer a man who, if he loves 
out-of-doors, loves to do things out-of-doors, 
even if it be to shoot deer or catch salmon ; we 
prefer a man who says something when he opens 
his mouth, even if it be not always the best 
and choicest remark possible, to one who smiles 
and can think of nothing worth saying. It 's 
a good thing to be willing to commit yourself. 

Miss Guiney likes to think of London as 
being a quiet place ; we prefer to think of it as 
noisy and hustling and full of people, cads as 
well as others. Miss Guiney likes to think of 
domestic animals conquered by man and curb- 
ing their great power to the melancholy superi- 
ority of unfeeling intellect ; we prefer leviathans 
which we can't hook and bulls in (somebody 
else's) china-shop. Miss Guiney thinks that 
art is made of seemly abstinences : some art 
may be, but to an art made of seemly absti- 
nences and nothing else, we prefer an art made 
of unseemly affirmations. At bottom, doubt- 
less, it does n't really matter what you do, and 
it doesn't really matter whether or not you do 
anything ; but this fundamental principle must 
be kept well out of sight, unless you are willing 
to go still-born to the grave. 

Historically speaking, this indifferentism is 
partly a reaction against the violence of Car- 
lyle and partly a conventional imitation of the 
descendants of the French-romantic reaction 
against conventionalism. It has manifested 
itself in fine forms, and, more often, in forms 
like the present. We think, on the whole, it 
is a sort of dry-rot in art. We will bet a big 
red apple that anyone who reads " Patrins " 
can see what the effect of such an attitude has 
been on Miss Guiney. It has deprived her of 
the power of thought and the power of style. 



Each essay is based on a fancy, not on an idea. 
Each sentence is set down with tender solici- 
tude as to how it will look, rather than with a 
compelling desire that it shall mean something. 
This is a pity. Miss Guiney could do some- 
thing, perhaps, if she would give up the idea 
that there was nothing worth her doing. 

We have spoken of Miss Guiney's style, and 
it is best to be more particular on the subject. 
Miss Guiney's style is a combination of meti- 
culated Emersonianism and effeminate imita- 
tion of Stevenson. It takes for fundamental 
principle the theory that an essay is a string of 
aphorisms, a sequence of declarative sentences, 
without formal connection. This crude and 
unrhythmical kind of prose is adorned with an 
enormous accumulation of figures of speech and 
painfully selected adverbs and adjectives. To 
what is original is added an equal amount of 
quotation. The whole is stuck over with such 
expressions as " marry " and " methinks " and 
all the syntactic affectations adopted by those 
who have rediscovered the Elizabethans. Such 
a style we have no hesitation in pronouncing 
bad, no matter how clever. 

For clever this book of essays undoubtedly 
is, clever and " charming " as well. But certain 
things will have been taken for granted about 
Miss Guiney's work, so we have thought it 
worth while to allude to some others.

LEGENDS AND Music OF THE NAVAJOS.* 

Few native tribes of America are more inter- 
esting than the Navajo ; no one is more compe- 
tent to describe them or to discuss their folk-lore 
than Dr. Matthews, who was for many years, 
as U. S. Army Surgeon, located near them. 
Dr. Matthews is a diligent worker in the field 
of American Ethnography. Years ago, his book 
on "The Ethnography and Philology of the 
Hidatsa Indians " appeared. Since then he has 
been stationed in the Southwest, and has pub- 
lished nearly a score of important papers about 
the Navajo, among which "Navajo Silver- 
smiths," "Navajo Weavers," and " The Moun- 
tain Chant " have most attracted popular atten- 
tion. He has also made useful contributions 
to Physical Anthropology. 

In " Navaho Legends " (when we quote the 
title we must spell the name as the author now

does, notwithstanding our disapproval of the 
innovation) Dr. Matthews presents us, first, a 
brief but valuable picture of Navajo ethnog- 
raphy ; second, three interesting legends, copi- 
ously annotated; third, a study of Navajo 
music by Prof. John Comfort Fillmore of 
Pomona College. The Navajo are the most 
advanced tribe of the great Athapascan family 
of Indians. Their linguistic relatives are usually 
of the wilder, and in some respects least attrac- 
tive, tribes of the continent. The Apaches, 
Montagnais, Slaves, are among their speech 
kindred. The people are not, however, pure of 
blood, but are much mixed with their neighbors, 
notably with various Pueblo and Shoshonean 
peoples. They have borrowed much from con- 
tact, and, being energetic, they have often im- 
proved their borrowings. Possibly they learned 
smithing and weaving of the Pueblos ; but if 
so, they now surpass their teachers. Their daily 
life and arts, their houses and industries, tales 
and religion, all have been profoundly influ- 
enced by the arid environment in which they 
live. The ethnographic sketch given by Dr. 
Matthews well prepares the reader for an intel- 
ligent study of the legends. 

Three classes of legends are preeminent 
among the stories of our Indian tribes the 
origin or cosmogonic legend, the migration 
legend, the culture-hero legend. Sometimes the 
three are clearly separated ; sometimes one story 
presents one element overshadowing the rest ; 
sometimes the three are inextricably combined. 
It is the origin legend of the Navajo that occu- 
pies the chief place in this book. In it are 
included elements of migration and culture-hero 
stories. The legend is long and detailed. It is 
subdivided into four sections, headed " The 
story of the Emergence," "Early events in the 
Fifth World," " The War-Gods," The Growth 
of the Navajo Nation." The people have come 
up from one after another of four previous 
worlds into this present stage of existence the 
fifth world. Each of the worlds has its own 
characteristics ; in each, the people had strange 
experiences. Nothing has happened without 
significance, and the impress of the past is upon 
the present, and the songs and ceremonials of 
this time are the result, and in some cases the 
dramatization, of those ancient happenings. 
All things around that need explanation are 
dealt with in this native philosophy. Dr. Mat- 
thews has translated the legends simply and 
with directness. On the whole, the Navajo 
Origin Legend appears more consistent and 
definite than most American Indian cosmogo- 



nies. One or two passages taken quite at ran- 
dom will illustrate the style and content. Sec- 
tion 163 describes the making of First Man 
and First Woman. The people " mentioned 
were not truly human beings : 

" The gods laid one buckskin on the ground with the 
head to the west; on this they placed two ears of corn, 
with their tips to the east, and over the corn they spread 
the other buckskin with its head to the east; under the 
white ear they put the feather of a white eagle, under 
the yellow ear the feather of a yellow eagle. Then they 
told the people to stand at a distance and allow the wind 
to enter. The white wind blew from the east, and the 
yellow wind blew from the west, between the skins. 
While the wind was blowing, eight of the Mirage Peo- 
ple came and walked around the objects on the ground 
four times, and as they walked the eagle feathers, whose 
tips protruded from between the buckskins, were seen 
to move. When the Mirage People had finished their 
walk the upper buckskin was lifted the ears of corn 
had disappeared ; a man and a woman lay there in their 
stead." 

Sometimes the incidents narrated contain a 
hint at real happenings in the tribal history. 
Thus, it is likely that the Navajo first got maize, 
or corn, from the Pueblos or Kisdni, as is sug- 
gested by section 189. 

" After this it was told around that the Kisani, who 
were in camp at a little distance from the others, had 
brought with them from the lower world an ear of corn 
for seed. Some of the unruly ones proposed to go to 
the camp of the Eisani and take the corn away from 
them; but others, of better counsel, said that this would 
be wrong, that the Kisani had had as much trouble as 
the rest, and if they had more foresight they had a right 
to profit by it. In spite of these words, some of the 
young men went and demanded the corn of the Kisani. 
The latter said, after some angry talk on both sides, 
' We will break the ear in two and give you whichever 
half you choose.' The young men agreed to this bar- 
gain, and the woman who owned the ear broke it in the 
middle and laid the pieces down for the others to choose. 
The young men looked at the pieces, and were consid- 
ering which they would take, when Coyote, getting 
impatient, picked up the tip end of the ear and made 
off with it. The Kisani kept the butt, and this is the 
reason the Pueblo Indians have to-day better crops of 
corn than the Navajos. But the Pueblos had become 
alarmed at the threats and angry language of their 
neighbors and moved away from them, and this is why 
the Navajos and the Pueblos now live apart from one 
another." 

Throughout the legends, of course, are items 
of belief, tribal practices, religious customs, 
either described or incidentally mentioned. In 
explanation of these, Dr. Matthews's notes and 
pictures are most valuable. 

Professor Fillmore's discussion of the Navajo 
music is both interesting and valuable. It is 
based upon a considerable collection of phono- 
graphic records. While Navajo music presents 
perhaps little that is truly characteristic, it 
fairly represents American Indian music gen-

erally. In the words, figurative language 
especially metaphor and simile abounds. Of 
rhetorical forms, antithesis, synecdoche, and 
climax are not uncommon. Those peculiarly 
favorite devices among savage and barbarous 
races, repetition and refrain are everywhere. 
Rhyme is rare. The words of a number of the 
songs are given with interlinear translation into 
English, and the melodies of ten are written 
out in ordinary musical notation. 

All in all, the volume is an important con- 
tribution to American Ethnography. It is the 
only one of the later Memoirs of the American 
Folk-Lore Society good as they all are 
that is really to be placed alongside of No. I., 
Chatelain's " Folk-Tales of Angola."

FAITH INSTINCTIVE.* 



We may accept reason as our proper guide when- 
ever it is present, but there are many times when it 
does not cover the ground. We are bringing reason 
very freely to the task of correcting religious belief ; 
and yet much of that belief rests, and must continue 
for a long time to rest, on instinctive tendencies, 
and on the force of events only partially amenable 
to reason. Religion has not arisen primarily as the 
product of reason, but as the result of feelings and 
of instinctive influences, inevitable in their action, 
and capable only of the slowest correction by later 
inquiry. " The heart has its reasonings which the 
reason knoweth nothing of." A hasty application 
of reason results in increasing the unreason already 
present in these obscure fields of thought in which 
so many impulses contend with each other. If one 
explores a mountain range by torchlight, he may 
reach a few certain conclusions, but there will re-

main a vast amount of mystery and darkness unre- 
solved. 

The books under criticism enforce this relation 
between the clear and the obscure in faith. " Later 
Gleanings," by Mr. Gladstone, occupies itself chiefly 
in putting limitations on the quick skepticism of our 
time. It is congenial to the mind of a statesman to 
give great force to the familiar renderings of belief, 
to the conceptions which, over large surfaces and 
for long periods, have governed men's thoughts and 
actions. The volume is especially valuable as en- 
countering the feeling that the old beliefs must give 
way at once to the attacks of modern criticism. 
The work is made up of thirteen essays, most of 
them occupied with a presentation and qualified 
defence of current topics of religious discussion. 
Colonel Ingersoll, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and Pro- 
fessor Huxley come under consideration. The vol- 
ume also contains several historical essays on the 
early history of the Church of England. 

The volume on " Christian Instincts and Modern 
Doubt " contains five essays. The one entitled " The 
Present State of Religious Thought in Great Brit- 
ain " comprises most of the volume. The author 
shows much insight. While feeling the force of 
current criticism, he is in hearty sympathy with the 
faith-tendency which idealizes the world and makes 
it primarily the realm of mind. He does not set 
himself the task of a systematic defence, but ex- 
poses sharply in many ways the spiritual barrenness 
of the assaults that come from a physical rendering 
of the world. Emerson, Browning, and Martineau 
are discussed with considerable fulness and much 
sympathy. Among the secondary essays is one 
entitled "The Unwisdom of Secularism." The 
volume arises from a sense of the ruling force of 
spiritual intuitions, and yet of the many ways in 
which they still need reconciliation in our thoughts 
with the facts and events which envelope us. 

" The Place of Death in Evolution " involves a 
still deeper conviction of the spiritual thread of life 
appearing but obscurely and slowly in the physical 
history of the world, and at length separating itself 
out in an adequate revelation of its own higher nature. 
The book is well conceived, but the thought is atten- 
uated, and receives more emphasis than it will easily 
bear. If the physical relations of death had been 
treated as incidental to its moral relations, the pro- 
portion of parts would have been better preserved, 
and the resources of the author been more fairly 
dealt with. 

" Bases of Religious Belief, Historic and Ideal," 
is a work of scholarship and insight. It rests on 
the intuitional philosophy applied with reason and 
correction. It is made up of two parts. The first 
treats of the religious questionings which have 
arisen in connection with historic and scientific crit- 
icism ; and the second, of the belief in an imma- 
nent intelligence, as urged on metaphysical, ethical, 
aesthetical, and spiritual grounds. The author says 
in the preface that he has aimed to give simply 
a resume of the conclusions of modern thought.

THE DIAL

This is more apparent in the first than in the 
second part. The result is some want of firm 
direction in the thought. It is neither definitely 
historical nor critical. In the second part, the 
author gives more freedom to his own mind. The 
result is a well-balanced and careful statement of 
the grounds of belief. We are disposed to criticise 
such expressions as " the God-consciousness " as 
inaccurate and misleading, even when the under- 
lying idea is unobjectionable. The word, con- 
sciousness, is slipping very much away from its 
direct and needed use. Consciousness can no more 
be made to stand for the elements involved in 
consciousness than the sunlit, rippling surface of 
the ocean for the obscure depths hidden under it. 

" The Open Mystery " can hardly be pronounced 
a successful volume. It is a re-cast of the early his- 
toric parts of the Old Testament. The author 
assigned herself a difficult task, and had neither the 
insight nor the critical power necessary to make its 
execution interesting to the well-informed reader. 

4< Foretokens of Immortality " is not an unpleas- 
ing rendering of the familiar convictions on immor- 
tality. It will soothe and assure the thoughts of 
those predisposed to belief. It is doubtless a result 
of the shifting farm of religious beliefs that so 
many are turning to the doctrine of immortality, 
struggling to give it a firmer and more vital hold. 
An exhortation to courage quickens the courageous, 
but makes slight appeal to the timid. So is it with 
the proofs of a future life. 

" In this Present World " is a volume of sermons 
of a plain, practical, and somewhat penetrative 
order. It is a good specimen of the prolific species 
to which it belongs. 

" Jesus Christ During His Ministry " is an inter- 
mediate volume between two others, " Jesus Christ 
Before His Ministry," and " The Death and Resur- 
rection of Jesus Christ," which is to follow. The 
author expresses his aims in these words : " I pro- 
pose, in fact, to speak above all things of Jesus 
himself, to ask what he thought, what he proposed 
to do, what he professed to be, and, as my general 
title says, what he said of his person, what authority 
he claimed, and what work he desired to do." The 
book deserves warm commendation. The thought 
is clear, penetrative, and free from prolixity. It 
helps to a more realistic grasp of the life and char- 
acter of Christ, and of the circumstances of his 
ministry. 

" Christian Worship " is composed of a series of 
lectures, given in Union Theological Seminary, on 
Liturgies, by leading men of different forms of faith. 
The introductory lecture, 'by Dr. Charles Cuthbert 
Hall, is on " The Principles of Christian Worship "; 
the closing lecture, by Dr. Thomas S. Hastings, is 
on "The Ideal of Christian Worship." The eight 
intervening lectures present Primitive Christian 
Liturgies, The Greek Liturgies, Roman Liturgies, 
Lutheran Liturgies, The Liturgies of the Reformed 
Church, The Book of Common Prayer, The Book 
of Common Order, Worship in Non-Liturgical 



Churches. The reader is thus put in pretty full 
possession of what is current in forms of Worship, 
and of the feeling which underlies liturgical worship. 
" Some Aspects of the Religious Life of New 
England " is a book quite in order, and interesting. 
The purpose of the author is to give " the religious 
life itself its dominating motives, its characteriz- 
ing experiences, its manifestations of spiritual power 
in the careers of the men and women of the nine 
generations that have dwelt upon New England soil 
since the landing of the Pilgrims." This task he 
has accomplished with insight, fairness, and con- 
siderable fulness. The volume serves to emphasize 
in still another way the force of events in determin- 
ing the current tendency of religious thought. The 
reason busies itself narrowly with the particular 
phase of work the circumstances assign it. The 
chapter on the present period is especially interest- 
ing ; a period in which the sense of sin is widening 
out into that of ethical law, in which doctrine is 
displaced by social theory, and the general welfare 
is substituted for personal piety. Religious devel- 
opment is cyclic, with actions and reactions ; a 
thorough recognition of the fact makes us at once 
more charitable, more peaceful, and more useful.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



A volume of ^ n one ^ ms recently-published let- 

essays by ters, the late Master of Balliol wrote 

Prof essor James. ag f O H OW8 : I f ee l very deeply 

that one cannot live without religion, and that 
in proportion as we believe less, that little, if it 
be only an aweful feeling about existence, must be 
more constantly present with us; as faith loses 
in extent it must gain in intensity, if we do not 
mean to shipwreck altogether." This passage 
would serve very well as a text for the " Essays in 
Popular Philosophy" (Longmans) that Professor 
William James has brought together into a volume 
made up from his occasional addresses and con- 
tributions to periodicals during the past score of 
years. This choice of a text is chiefly justified by 
the first four of the essays, " which are largely con- 
cerned with defending the legitimacy of religious 
faith." The essential position of the author might 
almost be illustrated by Shelley's " Prometheus," 
wherein we are exhorted 

" To hope till hope creates 
From its own wreck the thing it contemplates." 
There are cases, says Professor James, " where a 
fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith 
exists in its coming." Now while this is unde- 
niable as a general proposition, it is a dangerous 
principle to be taken as a guide by the untrained 
seeker after religious and philosophical truth. It 
is doubtless sometimes true, as in the case of the 
mountain-climber who can save his life only by a 
dangerous and terrible leap, that "faith before-

hand in an uncertified result is the only thing that 
makes the result come true," hut this is not quite 
the same thing as saying that faith in the cardinal 
doctrines of religion is the condition upon which 
their realization depends in any other than a sub- 
jective sense. Professor James might retort that 
this is, after all, only an ingenious way of begging 
the question, and that the subjective sense is the 
one most important to be considered in these high 
matters. But the defense that he actually does 
bring forward is made from a very different point 
of vantage, being substantially that his book is not 
addressed to a popular audience, exposed to the 
dangers of over-credulity, but rather to an aca- 
demic audience suffering from a " mental weakness 
brought about by the notion, carefully instilled, 
that there is something called scientific evidence 
by waiting upon which they shall escape all danger 
of shipwreck in regard to death." There is some- 
thing in this, to be sure, but not quite as much as 
the author would have us think, and the opposed 
view of such men as Clifford, for example, seems 
to us supported by a closer-knit logical cogency. 
It is all a question of degree, and the author's 
chapter on " Psychical Research " affords evidence 
that he carries his own principle of believing the 
things that we want to believe a little farther than 
most clear-sighted thinkers are willing to carry it. 
But there is no escaping the fascination of the 
author's exposition of his characteristic views, and 
the reader is ready to say more than once: "Al- 
most thou persuadest me to set in abeyance the 
thinking part of myself, and to let the heart dictate 
where the reason has held sway hitherto." The 
felicity of expression, the charm of manner, and 
the sympathetic hold upon life that are so richly 
displayed in these pages, make them remarkable 
among recent contributions to philosophical thought. 
Were the reader to reject in toto the fundamental 
teachings of this book, he still could not fail to 
profit by it, for it is the product of a rich and acute 
mind, which adorns every subject that it touches. 

The uncrowned monarch of the seven- 
teenth centur y is in this latter age 
beginning to stand forth in all his 
moral and political grandeur. Dr. R. F. Horton 
has made a study of him as a religionist, and has 
embodied his results in " Oliver Cromwell : a Study 
in Personal Religion" (Thomas Whittaker). The 
trend of his study is shown in his portrayal of the 
staunch, unbending, constant, moral and religious 
force of the almost invincible Cromwell. This re- 
ligion was not a side issue of the great hero, but it 
was the hero himself. In each civil strife, in his 
clashes with monarchy, in his appeals for the people, 
sturdy, eternal, and uncompromising religious prin- 
ciples controlled his action. His devotion to the 
cause of humanity is but the fruit of an inward life 
divinely planted and nourished. To exhibit these 
traits the author recites many of the pivotal points 
in his active career, but does it with such a sincere 



and devoted purpose as to allay all differences be- 
tween him and those who may not agree with him. 
Young men, and older ones, too, will receive a gen- 
uine inspiration to nobler action in the reading of 
this book. Dr. S. R. Gardiner delivered six lec- 
tures at the University of Oxford on " Oliver Crom- 
well's Place in History " which now form a neat 
little volume of 120 pages (Longmans). These 
discourses do not deal with the biography of the 
hero, but " estimate his relation to the political and 
ecclesiastical movements of his time." Dr. Gardiner 
embodies his lectures in a wonderfully lucid, clear, 
clean-cut, and forcible tongue. His estimate of 
Cromwell is well-balanced, and eminently just, 
though not identical with some other writers. Crom- 
well, he says, " was for that which has been the 
characteristic feature in English political history, 
the policy of bit-by-bit reform " (p. 41). Cromwell's 
settlement of Ireland was simply the beating down 
of everything opposed to British supremacy, while 
the constructive work was left to others (p. 57). 
Cromwell was not constructive, he was rather a 
mediator, a moderator (p. 81), embodying within 
himself elements " of championship for liberty, of a 
crusher of free institutions, of a defender of op- 
pressed peoples, and of an asserter of the country's 
right to dominion " (p. 114). " It is time for us to 
regard him as he really was, with all his physical 
and moral audacity, with all his tenderness and 
spiritual yearnings, in the world of action what 
Shakespeare was in the world of thought, the great- 
est, because the most typical, Englishman. This, in 
the most enduring sense, is Cromwell's place in his- 
tory " (p. 116). 

General James Grant Wilson, in 
General Grant. his study of General Grant in the 

"Great Commanders Series" (D. 
Appleton & Co.), necessarily devotes most of his 
attention to the period of the Civil War. A brief 
sketch is given of the points of interest in the life 
of Grant both before and after that period, but it 
is for the most part written in a perfunctory man- 
ner. On the other hand, the story of the great 
campaigns is told with enthusiasm and with clear- 
ness, though it is possible that, to a non-military 
reader, the detailed accounts of the movements of 
this or that brigade or regiment may be somewhat 
confusing. These details will, no doubt, be of great 
interest to the old soldier who took part in the 
battles described, or to one who desires to make a 
careful study of them. But the majority of the 
readers of this book will not have had any military 
training, and therefore will not be able to estimate, 
from mere detailed battle accounts, the genius of 
the man who commanded in battle. What is needed 
is either broader and less technical descriptions of 
battles and campaigns, with more of the personality 
of Grant thrown into and illuminating them, or 
explanatory notes to indicate wherein such and such 
a movement or march gave evidence of great mili- 
tary ability. In fact, after having followed Grant,

in this book, from his first command in Illinois to 
his final victory over Lee in Virginia, the impres- 
sion is left upon the mind of the reader that all 
that has been learned about General Grant's great 
genius in war is that he was aggressive, courageous, 
and always confident of the ultimate success of his 
cause. By far the most interesting portion of the 
work is to be found in the letters to the Hon. E. 
B. Washburne, for in these General Grant revealed 
to his friend sentiments and opinions not often 
shown even to his intimates. The concluding chap- 
ter, also, upon Grant's last days and death, is writ- 
ten with a delicacy and an affection which evince 
the author's love for his hero. 



That labyrinthian crystal palace of 
inside of Kentucky, concealed from the light 

Mammoth Cave. ... . -, 

of the sun, is attracting more and 
more the attention of the scientific, the literary, and 
the travelling public. Messrs. Hovey and Call have 
now put themselves on record, in a small manual 
(John P. Morton & Co., Louisville), as explorers 
and guides to that great net-work of caverns called 
Mammoth Cave. They present a history of its dis- 
coveries from Hutchins's legendary Bear chase, 
down to the last map whose cavernous contortions 
almost bewilder the innocent reader sitting in his 
easy study chair. After a somewhat elaborate sketch 
of that section of Kentucky, the guides lead off to 
the route of pits and domes. Such exquisite forma- 
tions ! Such splendid palatial domes, and awful 
pits ! Adjectives lose their force and the visitor 
stands or moves about, lost in wonder and in praise. 
" The chief city and fairy grotto," then " the river 
route " follow in order. Many questions of the 
visitor are answered by the well-prepared chapter 
on " the natural history of the cavern." The book- 
let is illustrated by a large number of beautiful half- 
tone cuts of some of the most pleasing and startling 
views in the cavern. The reading of this manual is 
a good preparation for a visit to that underground 
art-gallery of nature. 

A little book of 145 pages entitled 
The baptem of Th Baptism of Roger Williams " 

Roger Williams. r D T* j n \ 

(Providence : Preston & Hounds Co.) 
is one link in a chain of controversy, begun, as far 
back as 1880, by some articles published anony- 
mously in " The Independent." In 1893, President 
Whitsitt of the Southern Baptist Theological Sem- 
inary published two articles in " Johnson's Universal 
Cyclopaedia " on " Anabaptists " and " Baptists " in 
which he held that the evidence at hand does not 
warrant one in asserting that the English Baptists 
practised immersion as baptism prior to 1641. In 
the Cyclopdia Dr. Whitsitt says regarding the 
baptism of Roger Williams : " The ceremony was 
most likely performed by sprinkling ; the Baptists 
of England had not yet adopted immersion, and 
there is no reason which renders it probable that 
Williams was in advance of them in that regard." 
The venerable pastor, Dr. H. M. King, of the First 



Baptist Church of Providence, Williams's stamping 
ground, promptly calls down the Southern Seminary 
President, and, if argument and evidence settle the 
case, states and makes his point with clearness and 
precision, that Roger Williams was baptised by 
immersion. 



Organic 
Education. 



For several years Miss Hattie M. 
Scott has been trying an educational 
experiment in one of the ward 
schools of Detroit which is full of suggestion and 
instruction. The results of this experiment, and 
the theory which directed the teachers, are now 
presented in a book of 289 pages, which deserves 
the attention of teachers. Part I. " Embodies the 
philosophical interpretation of the plan. It pre- 
sents not the starting point for that was purely 
practical but the apparent meaning of that which 
has been done. Part II. is a detailed statement of 
the methods actually pursued and of the materials 
actually employed." Some of the features of Pro- 
fessor Dewey's remarkable school in Chicago are 
found in Miss Scott's book. The volume is pub- 
lished by Messrs. J. V. Sheehan & Co., Ann Arbor. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Happy is the library that can undertake the publica- 
tion of such costly bibliographical works as the one 
recently sent us from the Boston Athenaeum. It is a 
" Catalogue of the Washington Collection " in that insti- 
tution, compiled and annotated by Mr. Appleton P. C. 
Griffin, and provided with an important Appendix by 
Mr. William C. Lane. It makes a sumptuous volume 
of nearly six hundred pages, illustrated by facsimile 
title-pages, a vignette of the interior of the Athenseum, 
and an engraving of the Stuart portrait. The Wash- 
ington collection of books was begun in 1848, when a 
number of citizens subscribed to a fund for the purchase 
of books from the Mount Vernon library of George 
Washington. The present catalogue includes all of the 
books then purchased, besides many others relating to 
Washington in various ways. It is a bibliographical 
work of the highest value, as well as an interesting 
memorial of the first President of the Republic. 

The latest text-books for teachers of the modern 
languages include the following: Part Third of " The 
Study and Practice of French in School," by Miss Louise 
C. Boname (Philadelphia: The Author); "L'Abbe* 
Constantin" (the comedy), edited by Mr. V. E. Francois 
(American Book Co.); "L'Oncle et le Neveu," by 
About, edited by Mr. G. Castegnier (Jenkins); " Fra le 
Corde di un Contrabasso," a story by Signer S. Farina, 
edited by Professor T. E. Comba (Jenkins). 

Dr. Albert F. Blaisdell is the author of " A Practical 
Physiology" (Ginn) for high schools, which is well- 
arranged, and provided with the sort of helps that 
young students most need. Our main criticism upon 
the work is that it makes too great concessions to the 
"temperance" and anti-tobacco extremists who have 
succeeded in getting a good deal of pernicious educa- 
tional legislation adopted in the several States. Al- 
cohol has thirty-three entries in the index, and tobacco 
twelve, thus leading all the other subjects.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OP FALL, BOOKS. 



THE DIAL'S list of books announced for Fall issue by 
American publishers, which has become an important 
annual feature of the paper, is this year very much the 
largest ever given. It contains over 1100 titles, against 
900 last year ; and represents sixty houses, nine 
more than last year. The feeling of encouragement 
and general improvement that marks the business 
world at present has evidently reached the publishers, 
and the showing made by them in the following List 
reflects the greatest credit on their activity and energy. 
The outlook for a prosperous season is certainly good, 
and the American publishing trade is to be congratulated 
on its alertness to take advantage of the " turn in the 
tide." The classification of the books into departments 
adds greatly to the usefulness and interest of the List, 
and furnishes the basis of some analysis and comment 
in the leading editorial article of this issue. The 
department of Juveniles is deferred until our next 
number. All the books here given are presumably 
new books new editions not being included unless 
having new form or matter; and the List does not 
include Fall books already issued and entered in our 
regular List of New Books.

with binding of unusual simplicity as well as elegance,

Professor E. T. Merrill, of Wesleyan University, has 
edited a small volume of " Fragments of Roman Satire 
from Ennius to Apuleius," and the work is published 
by the American Book Co. 

"Foster's Complete Hoyle," which the publishers 
describe as " the only entirely original book on games 
that has appeared for one hundred and fifty years," is 
issued by the Frederick A. Stokes Co. 

Dr. J. F. Brigham, of Trinity College, Hartford, has 
made a translation of Silvio Pellico's " Francesca da 
Rimini," and provided the tragedy with a critical preface 
and historical introduction. The book is published by 
Mr. C. W. Sever, of Cambridge. 

The American Book Co. has just published a 
" Natural Elementary Geography " prepared for them 
by the eminent geographer, Mr. Jacques W. Redway, 
in accordance with the most advanced ideas of scientific 
pedagogy. 

All the published works of Mr. Austin Dobson, 
including the half-dozen volumes that have appeared 
from 1873 to the present time, are to be brought out 
this fall in a one-volume edition, revised and arranged 
by the author. 

The Illinois State Historical Library, established in 
1889, has now collected over six thousand books and 
pamphlets. Contributions of suitable material, such 
as reports, educational catalogues, and old newspapers, 
will be welcomed by the trustees. 

The Inland Publishing Co., of Terre Haute, Indiana, 
has just issued " An Outline of Method in History," 
by Professor Ellwood W. Kemp. It is intended as 
a text-book for students in normal schools and for 
teachers of history. 

Mr. James Schouler, having finished the manuscript 
of his " Constitutional Studies," has begun the long- 
promised sixth and concluding volume of his " History 
of the United States," embracing the period of the civil 
war. It is hoped that this will be ready next year. 

Number 5 of Mr. G. P. Humphrey's " American 
Colonial Tracts " is " an account showing the progress 
of the colony of Georgia, in America, from its first 
establishment." The original was printed in London, 
in 1741, and reprinted the following year in Annapolis, 
Maryland. 

We have received from Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. 
" The Court of the Tuileries," in two volumes, com- 
pleting the fourteen- volume reprint of Lady Jackson's 
works. The present edition is well illustrated, and 
far more convenient to handle than the earlier ones, 
besides being less expensive. 

"The Liver of Dyspeptics, and Particularly the 
Cirrhosis Produced by Auto-Intoxication of Gastro- 
intestinal Origin," is the cheerful title of a work 
described as a " clinical, anatomo-pathological, patho- 
genic, and experimental study," written by Dr. Emile 
Boix, translated by Dr. Paul Richard Brown, and pub- 
lished by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

We have received from the University Publishing 
Co. a number of educational works that deserve a 
word of mention. They include a " University Series 
of Map-Studies," which are blanks for map-drawing 
upon an ingenious system ; a " Golden Rod " series of 
reading books for grades one to four, compiled by Mr. 



John H. Haaren; and a " Standard Literature " series, 
comprising twenty-three numbers, and including such 
books as " Evangeline " (edited by Dr. E. E. Hale, Jr.), 
"The Lady of the Lake," three volumes of Irving, 
three of Hawthorne, three of Cooper, three of Dickens, 
two of Scott, and a number of other novels and poems. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish " Via Latina," an " easy 
Latin reader " by Mr. W. C. Collar; and Book V. of the 
"Anabasis," edited by Mr. Alfred G. Rolfe. From 
Messrs. Leach, Shewell, & Sanborn we have " M. Tulli 
Ciceronis Cato Maior de Senectute," edited by Professor 
Charles E. Bennett. The American Book Co. sends us 
" A Brief Latin Grammar," by Mr. W. D. Mooney. 

In a new book entitled " Annals of Switzerland " 
(A. S. Barnes & Co.), by Julia M. Colton, an account 
is given of all the more important events of Swiss his- 
tory. The book is well written and accurate, but the 
author confines herself so closely to the statement of 
political events that little impression or picture of the 
Swiss as a people is left to the reader. A good index 
makes the work valuable for handy reference. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. are still engaged in the 
praiseworthy work of publishing editions of standard 
literature that are at once attractive and inexpensive. 
Among their recent issues we note with particular 
satisfaction four volumes of their pretty " Faience " 
edition, including Hawthorne's " Scarlet Letter," Meri- 
meVs " Colomba," Sir Lewis Morris's " Epic of Hades," 
and M. Anatole France's " Crime of Sylvestre Bon- 
nard." 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers have just published a 
new edition of " Mrs. Keith's Crime," by Mrs. W. K. 
Clifford. This rather remarkable novel first appeared 
in 1885, when the author was entirely unknown, except 
as the widow of the brilliant scholar whose name she 
bears. It has many crudities, but a certain underlying 
power has kept it alive, and many readers who know 
Mrs. Clifford only through her later novels will be 
glad of the opportunity to revert to her first piece of 
fictional work. 

Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. announce a new edition of 
Mr. William Kirby's romance, " The Golden Dog." 
The publication is authorized by Mr. Kirby, and the 
fact that the author is still living will come as a surprise 
to many readers, for his book somehow seems to belong 
to a very remote past. It is still very popular in 
Canada, and its only rival, according to the testimony 
of the stalls and windows of book-shops in Montreal 
and Quebec, appears to be Mr. Gilbert Parker's " The 
Seats of the Mighty." 

The object of a new edition of the " Faerie Queene," 
projected by the Macmillan Co., is to supply a pleasant, 
handy, inexpensive edition for general use. Each of the 
six volumes is to contain one book, and the first volume 
is now issued. Its special features are a brief introduc- 
tion by the editor, Kate M. Warren, a somewhat full 
glossary, and a sufficient number of notes at the end of 
the volume to serve the uses of those who have neither 
access to larger editions, nor time to consult books of 
reference. 

Wagner's novelette, " A Pilgrimage to Beethoven," 
was written by the composer during his first stay in 
Paris. Although it was a sort of pot-boiler, it has 
sufficient importance to warrant its preservation as a 
piece of literature, while its value is great considered 
as a document in the life-history of that extraordinary 
genius. The Open Court Publishing Co. have there-

"The story is full of action, it is alive from cover to cover, and is so compact with thrilling adventure that 
there is no room for a dull page. The chevalier tells his own story, but he is the most charming of egoists. He 
wins our sympathies from the outset by his boyish naivete, his downright manliness and bravery. . . . Not 
only has Mr. Yeats written an excellent tale of adventure, but he has shown a close study of character which 
does not borrow merely from the trappings of historical actors, but which denotes a keen knowledge of human 
nature, and a shrewd insight into the workings of human motives. . . . The fashion of the period is kept well 
in mind, the style of writing has just that touch of old-fashioned formality which serves to veil the past from 
the present, and to throw the lights and shadows into a harmony of tone. . . . The work has literary quality of 
a genuine sort in it, which raises it above a numerous host of its fellows in kind." Bookman, New York. 

"... A story of Huguenot days, brim full of action that takes shape in plots, sudden surprises, fierce en- 
counters, and cunning intrigues. The author is so saturated with the times of which he writes that the story is 
realism itself. . . . The story is brilliant and thrilling, and whoever sits down to give it attention will reach 
the last page with regret." Globe, Boston.

HISTORY OF 

THE PEQUOT WAR. 

Edited, with Notes and an Introduction, by CHARLES 

OKR, Librarian of Case Library. 

We have pleasure in announcing the publication, for 
the first time in one volume, of the four contemporary 
accounts of the Pequot War written by Captain John 
Mason, Captain John Underbill, P. Vincent, and Lieut. 
Lion Gardener. It has seemed to the publishers that 
the placing of accurate reprints of these important 
documents within the reach of a larger circle of readers 
would be appreciated by librarians and by students of 
American history. An introduction by Mr. Charles 
Orr will set forth in detail the history of the narratives 
themselves, and all needed notes and data will be 
added. Readers will appreciate the clear-cut, bold- 
faced type. The book will be printed on antique deckle- 
edged paper. It will be bound in full buckram, with 
gilt top. The edition will be limited, and each volume 
will be numbered. These will be assigned as subscrip- 
tions are received.

" It tells of many an Oriental custom, hoary with age, and full of 
instruction for the modern student of the Bible. ... I commend 
it for exactly what it is the record of useful deeds by a capable and 
patient explorer and feel sure that many will find light and knowledge 
in it." PROFESSOR ROGERS, in Introduction. 

LIGHT FROM EGYPT.

No land of the Orient has yielded richer results to the heroic effort 
of the modern explorer than Egypt. Voluminous works are written, 
. but they are beyond the reach of all but the savant. The present vol- 
ume presents the substance of the matter for popular use. It is the 
work of a master.

Seldom have such personalities as Browning and Shakespeare and 
Burns and Hawthorne, or such epochal characters as Cromwell and 
William of Orange, been more vividly reproduced by human pen. Six- 
teen short essays make up the volume. Printer and binder have con- 
spired to give the author an appropriate setting. The book reflects 
great credit upon both author and publishers.

Chronological Arrangements of its Elements, and its 
Relation to Christian Worship. By Prof. WILLIAM 
WALLACE MARTIN. 12mo, cloth, over 550 illustra- 
tions, 429 pages, $2.00. 

The work is a careful study of the famous cathedrals of mediaeval 
and modern Europe, and also of the prevailing types of church archi- 
tecture in America. It is profusely illustrated, and has a complete 
index and a valuable glossary of technical words. It covers a field but 
little cultivated heretofore, and is a valuable addition to ecclesiastical 
bibliography.

Students of history, of every shade of religious belief, will find this

unusually discerning in assigning them their place and true value in 
the general trend of history.

THE FIFTH GOSPEL; or, The Gospel 

According to St. Paul. (Revised Version.) 
By CHARLES ROADS, D.D. IGmo, cloth, 112 pages, 
50 cts. 

On the basis of Paul's claim to have received his Gospel directly by 
revelation, and not from any human source, the author has gathered 
from his writings and addresses all those references to the character 
and mission of Jesus which embody the apostle's conception of him. 
So far as we know, the plan is original and altogether unique; the 
result is an intensely interesting volume, which will be of great value 
to every student of the New Testament.

THE QUEEN & CRESCENT 
ROUTE. 

During the Tennessee Centennial and International 
Exposition at Nashville, Tenn., a low-rate special tariff 
has been established for the sale of tickets from 
Cincinnati and other terminal points on the Queen & 
Crescent Route. 

Tickets are on sale daily until further notice to Chat-

Cincinnati, the round trip tickets being good seven days 
to return; other tickets, with longer return limit, at

PATIENCE SPARHAWK AND HER TIMES. By 

GERTRUDE ATHERTON. Crown 8vo, $1.50. 
I am extremely grateful to Mrs. Atherton for what I 
consider one of the greatest novels of our time, and one of 
the most vivid pictures of life as it is near the centre of our 
American maelstrom. " Patience Sparhawk " should inter- 
est the people of to-day. Town Topics. 
''Patience Sparhawk" may be placed alongside of

goes, whilst in its insight into character it reaches a level 
which we have hitherto very rarely encountered outside the 
pages of George Eliot. The New Age (London). 


SYMPHONIES. By GEORGE EGERTON. Crown 8vo, 
$1.25. 
The New York Evening Sun says : " 'Symphonies ' is, 
in our opinion, the best volume of short stories which has 
appeared since the last of Rudyard Kipling. Strong, frank, 
outspoken, and complete. In bringing out character, the 
author's methods are subtle and almost impossible to define. 
The stories are fascinating, and contain many passages to 
which one returns." 


MIDDLE GREYNESS. By A. J. DAWSON. Crown 
8vo, $1.50. 
There have been many " Bush " stories since Charles 
Reade's " Never too Late to Mend," but few better than 
"Middle Greyness." Boston Transcript. 
The author has embodied in the character of the old out- 
cast much of the spirit of weird sadness and grim, cynical 
despair in the vast shadows of the great Australian bush."

A novel with a sweeter, saner tone and with a finer 
pathos than " Derelicts " it will be hard to find in the year's

Mr. Locke has written a novel of more than ordinary 
power and interest, one that bears witness to a subtle com- 
prehension of the inwardness of a man's nature banned as 
was his hero's, and one that will bear that crucial test of the

The Story of the Cowboy. 

By E. HOUGH, author of " The Singing 
Mouse Stories," etc. A new volume 
in The Story of the West Series, edited 
byRiPLEY HITCHCOCK. Illustrated. 
12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 
The very picturesqueness of the cowboy has 
subjected him to misinterpretation, and hie 
actual story and a picture of the great indus- 
try which he has conducted may be said to be 
presented adequately for the first time in Mr. 
Hough's spirited and fascinating pages. The 
story which he tells is a strange and romantic 
one, impressive on the practical side by reason 
of the magnitude of the business described, 
and yery valuable from the historical point of 
view, because this book preserves in perma- 
nent form a typical figure of Western life, and 
also the development and the passing, or rather 
transformation, of a vast industry almost with- 
in a generation.

French Stumbling Blocks 

and English Stepping 

Stones. 

By FRANCIS TAKVER, M.A., late senior 
French Master at Eton College. 12mo. 
Cloth, $1.00. 

This work, based on thirty years' expe- 
rience of teaching French to English boys, 
does not profess to be a systematic grammar 
or dictionary, but to combine many of the 
practical advantages of both, with the addition 
of much which is not generally to be found 
in either. The chief difficulties which an En- 

tlishman finds in learning to speak French 
uently and correctly arise from the forma- 
tion of sentences, the collocation of words, 
the similarity of words and phrases in the 
two languages which are really different, and 
the dissimilarity of those which are frequently 
the same. Rules and examples for the avoid- 
ing of these pitfalls are given in this book, 
and, in addition, a section on " Deceptive 
Resemblances," and a list of 3,000 idiomatic 
expressions in everyday use. 

Curious Homes and Their 
Tenants. 

By JAMBS CARTER BEARD. Appletons' 
Home-Reading Books Series. Illus- 
trated. 12mo. Cloth, 65 cts. net. 
Mr. Beard has been styled a classic writer 
for boys and girls, and some of his best work 
will be found in this volume. It treats of an 
unusually attractive phase of zoSlogical study, 
and gives to animal life and instincts a new 
and human interest. Every boy and girl will 
find in it a rare fund of entertaining and in- 
structive reading, greatly enhanced by the 
many illustrations made by the author ex- 
pressly for this book. 

Manual of Physical Drill. 

By Lieut. EDMUND L. BUTTS, Twenty- 
first Infantry, U. S. A. Illustrated. 
12mo. Cloth, $1.25. 
The object of this manual is to systematize 
physical training and to furnish a practical 
guide for regular and beneficial instruction. 
The book will be found of great value to all 
military organizations and schools. 



Natural History. 

By R. LTDEKKER, F.R.S., R. BOWD- 
LER SHARPE, LL D , W. F. KERBY, 
F.L.S.. R. B. WOODWABD, F.G.S., 
W. GARSTANG. M.A., H. M BER- 
NARD, F.L.S., and others. The first 
volume in The Concise Knowledge 
Library. Nearly 800 pages, and 500 
ilhiHtrations drawn especially for this 
work. 8vo. Half binding, $2.00. 
This work aims to be a concise and popu- 
lar Natural History, at once accurate in state- 
ment, handy in form, and ready for reference. 
The several departments of zoological science 
are treated by specialists, all of whom are dis- 
tinguished as authorities and as original in- 
vestigators ; and the text is illustrated by up- 
ward of five hundred original drawings made 
and reproduced expressly for this work. A 
concise systematic index precedes the work, 
and a full alphabetical index which contains 
about ten thousand references is given at the 
end. Great pains have been taken to render 
these both accurate and complete. 

Familiar Features of the 
Roadside. 

By F. SCHUYLKR MATHEWS, author of 
"Familiar Flowers of Field and Gar- 
den," "Familiar Trees and Their 
Leaves," etc. With 130 illustrations 
by the author. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75. 
The country roads have a life of their own 
of great interest if one is properly guided, and 
Mr. Mathews has written his book in order to 
set forth the life of the trees, bushes, flowers, 
insects, and birds which are found along the 
roads. He has carried out an idea which will 
interest those who walk, or drive, or ride a 
wheel in the country. 

Some Unrecognized Laws of 
Nature. 

An Inquiry into the Causes of Physical 
Phenomena, with Special Reference 
to Gravitation. By IGNATIUS SINGER 
and LEWIS H. BERENS. Illustrated. 
12mo. Cloth. $2.50. 
This is an entirely new and original work, 
the result of long study and independent prac- 
tical experiment. It has grown out of the ex- 
perience of the authors in their attempts to 
apply the physical method of inquiry to the 
elucidation of biological problems, more espe- 
cially those in connection with the life of man. 

The Story of Germ Life. 

By H. W. CONN, Professor of Biology 
at Wesleyan University; Author of 
"The Living World," etc. Library 
of Useful Stories. Illustrated. 18mo, 
Cloth, 40 cts. 

In clear and popular language Professor 
COT n outlines the development of bacteriology, 
explains the nature and characteristics of bac- 
teria, and the important part which they play 
in the economy of Nature and in industry. 

Barbara Blomberg. 

A Historical Romance. By GEORG 
EBERS, author of " Uarda," " Cleo- 
patra," "Joshua," etc. Translated 
by Mary J. Safford. 2 vols. l(imo. 
Cloth, $1.50 ; paper. 80 cts. 
The time of this strong historical romance 
is the period of turmoil which followed the 
death of Luther, when Protestants and Catho- 
lics were struggling for the mastery in Ger- 
many and the Netherlands. 



Fourth Edition. 

The Christian. 

A Story. By HALL CAINE. author of 
The Manxman," "The Deemster," 

"The Bondman," etc. 12mo. Cloth, 

$1.50. 

" The public is hardly prepared for so re- 
markable a performance as ' The Christian.' 
It is a great social panorama, crowded with 
living figures, phases of life, color, and inci- 
dents. All these are knit together and made 
live by constant action. There is not a lay 
figure in the book ; every man and woman 1s a 
living, breathing, thinking, acting creature. 
. . . Great as 'The Christian 'undoubtedly is, 
considered as a portrayal of certain portion! 
of the social fabric, it is even greater when 
considered as a story. ... ' The Christian ' 
will almost certainly be the book of the year. 
It is a permanent addition to English litera- 
ture. It is bound to be very popular, but it 
is above and beyond any popularity that is 
merely temporary. "Boston Herald. 

Fourth Edition. 
Equality. 

By EDWARD BELLAMY, author of 
"Looking Backward," "Dr. Heiden- 
hoff's Process," etc. 12mo. Cloth, 
81.25. 

" It is a greater book than ' Looking Back- 
ward,' while it is more powerful ; and the 
smoothness, the never-failing interest, the 
limpid clearness, and the simplicity of the ar- 
gument, and the timeliness, will make it ex- 
tremely popular. Here is a book that every 
one will read and enjoy." Boston Herald. 

A Soldier of Manhattan, 

And his Adventures at Ticonderoga and 
Quebec. By J. A. ALTSHELER, au- 
thor of " The Sun of Saratoga." No. 
225, Town and Country Library. 
12mo. Cloth, $1.00 ; paper, 50 cts. 
This vivid colonial romance opens with a 
series of pictures of New York in the middle 
of the eighteenth century. The adventurous 
career of the hero includes a share in Aber- 
crombie's defeat at Ticonderoga, and a period 
of captivity in Quebec, which was followed by 
an escape and an opportunity to play a part in 
the meeting of Wolfe and Montcalm on the 
Plains of Abraham. This graphic and fascinat- 
ing historical American romance will be cer- 
tain to take high rank with readers. 

Mifanwy. 

(A Welsh Singer.) By ALLEN RAINE. 

No. 224, Town and Country Library. 

12mo. Cloth, $1.00 ; paper, 50 cts. 

This charming story opens in Wales, and 
shows a fresh and inviting local color. The 
later action passes in London, and also in 
Wales, and music and musical life play a lead- 
ing part. 

His Majesty's Greatest 
Subject. 

By S. S. THORBURN, author of " Asiat- 
ic Neighbours," etc. No. 223, Town 
and Country Library. 12mo. Cloth, 
81.00 ; paper, 50 cts. 
A strong and imaginative romance, pictur- 
ing not only stirring adventures in India con- 
nected with high politics, mutiny, and war, 
but also the relations of India to the outside 
world during the European war, which the 
author, who writes of the future, imagines as 
taking place.

A LITERARY ANNIVERSARY. 

The October number of " The Atlantic 
Monthly," which celebrates the fortieth anni- 
versary of that periodical, is as noteworthy an 
issue of a magazine as has ever appeared in 
this country, and is at the same time sugges- 
tive of a good many reflections concerning the 
history of American literature, both periodical 
and general. In this case, indeed, the ordi- 
nary distinction between these two kinds of 
literature, together with the implied notion 
that one is inferior to the other, very nearly 
vanishes, so closely have the interests of the 



" Atlantic " always been bound up with those 
of literature in the best sense. Not only has a 
large part of what we all recognize as the per- 
manent literature of the nation first seen the 
light in the pages of this magazine, but it has 
also occupied from the start, and with no lapse 
from its high aims, the unique position ex- 
pressed by its constant purpose " to hold liter- 
ature above all other human interests, and to 
suffer no confusion of its ideals." In describ- 
ing the position of the "Atlantic" as unique, 
we have no intention of disparaging the work 
done by the illustrated monthlies, which have 
placed so much wholesome and instructive 
reading in the hands of the public, which have 
contributed so notably to the development of 
popular artistic taste, and which have offered 
so generous an encouragement to the profes- 
sion of letters by providing a satisfactory mar- 
ket for all sorts of good work. But the fact 
remains that the great success of the " Atlan- 
tic " has been achieved and maintained without 
the adventitious aid of pictures, that the time- 
liness of a theme or the notoriety of a writer 
have never alone been sufficient to secure ad- 
mission to its pages, and that it has not been 
willing to attack the social and political abuses 
of the time unless it might enlist the grace of 
literary form as an efficient ally in the crusade. 
The temptation to pursue ideals somewhat 
less severe than these must sometimes have been 
very great. The illustrated monthlies have 
grown up and flourished like green bay trees 
(although we would not have the simile of the 
Psalmist carried to its logical conclusion in all 
their cases), while the "Atlantic" has enjoyed 
its modest prosperity in unenvious self-respect. 
It has seen some of its contemporaries broaden 
their circulation to an extent tenfold that of its 
own without swerving from the lines which it 
originally marked out. It has viewed with equa- 
nimity their successful exploitation of one popu 
lar theme after another, and has refrained from 
following their example, so alluring from the 
standpoint of the counting-room, because their 
methods savored necessarily of journalism. It 
has stood calmly aside while the lions of the 
hour have been captured and placed on exhib- 
ition by other magazines, because its editors 
have always demanded something more than 
the ephemeral interest that attaches to men 
and subjects that are but the fashion of the 



174

day. It has eschewed the pictorial appeal to 
popularity because of its abiding faith in the 
virtue of a singleness of aim, and because it has 
recognized the fact that illustrations cannot be 
associated with literature without some lower- 
ing of the technical standards of the latter art. 
And for the exercise of this threefold restraint, 
if it has fallen behind in the race for commer- 
cial success, it has won the respect and the 
loyalty of all who can fitly appreciate a fine 
ideal constantly pursued, of all for whom the 
dignity of the literary calling is a matter of 
deep personal concern. " Holding fast to the 
faith of its founders," such is its proud and well- 
warranted boast, "that literature is one of the 
most serious concerns of men, and that the high- 
est service to our national life is the encour- 
agement and the production of literature, the 
'Atlantic' has never had owner or editor who 
was tempted to change its steadfast course by 
reason of any changing fashion." 

The names of the owners and editors who 
have thus handed down the magazine whose 
record is so enviable are inscribed upon a roll 
of honor in the minds of the generation that 
has grown up with the life of the " Atlantic." 
Of the publishers there are Phillips, Sampson 
& Co., Ticknor and Fields, and the successors 
of the latter down to the present firm of Messrs. 
Hough ton, Mifflin & Co. Of the editors there 
are Lowell, (1859-61), Fields (1861-71), Mr. 
Howells (1871-80), Mr. Aldrich (1880 90), 
and Mr. Scudder (1 890-97). Nor must we omit 
the name of Mr. Walter H. Page, who became 
associated with Mr. Scudder in 1895, and 
whose vigorous editorial policy has given new 
life and strength to the magazine during the 
past two years. Some of the recent numbers, 
indeed, have contained groups of articles so 
solid in content and so dignified in form as to 
challenge a favorable comparison with the best 
issues of the old days, when the contributors to 
the magazine included the half dozen greatest 
men in American literature. 

A list of the famous productions that first 
saw the light in the " Atlantic " would be too 
lengthy to find a place in these notes, and only 
a few may be even mentioned. At the very 
start, Lowell insisted "that Dr. Holmes should 
be engaged as the first contributor," and to 
that insistence we owe the fact that the first 
number contained the beginning of the " Auto- 
crat " papers. Emerson's " Brahma " also ap- 
peared in that first number, and proved "caviare 
to the general." There were a dozen other prin- 
cipal contributors besides these two, and three 



of them are living to-day. A few of the famous 
poems written for the " Atlantic " are " Paul 
Revere's Ride," "The Wonderful One-Hoss 
Shay," "The Chambered Nautilus," " Barbara 
Frietchie," "The Commemoration Ode," "Friar 
Jerome's Beautiful Book," "The Fool's Prayer," 
and " Prospice." We name only poems so gen- 
erally familiar that the names of their authors 
come to the mind at once. In fiction, besides 
the many serials, there are such stories as 
" Marjorie Daw " and " The Man Without a 
Country." In sober scholarship there are such 
writings as Clarke's " Ten Great Religions," 
and the scientific papers of Agassiz. In short, 
there is no department of American literature, 
whether creative or scholarly, that would not 
be much the poorer were it without the works 
that have represented it in the " Atlantic 
Monthly." 

For forty years, then, this magazine has been 
devoted to " literature, science, art, and politics " 
(so runs the cover- title), and "literature" has 
rarely been missing even from the treatment of 
the other major themes. The editor draws a 
parallel between the contents of the magazine 
for its first and its fortieth years which well 
shows how steadfastly the same intellectual aims 
have been pursued. Rather than repeat this 
comparison, we prefer to suggest certain con- 
trasts between the contents of the anniversary 
issue now before us and any possible issue of 
the magazine forty years ago. The proverb 
that men and their interests change with the 
changing times could not receive a better illus- 
tration. Mr. James Lane Allen's " Two Prin- 
ciples in Recent American Fiction " requires 
for its inductions a literature of some matur- 
ity, and such a paper could hardly have been 
written in 1857. M. Brunetiere's contribution 
stands for our modern cosmopolitanism, and 
an essay by a foreign critic would have been 
a strange phenomenon indeed in the provin- 
cial days of the " Atlantic." Almost equally 
strange would have been an essay upon a young 
contemporary Italian novelist, and such a nov- 
elist could he have been discovered as Sig- 
nor d'Annunzio. " A Russian Experiment in 
Self-Government," by Mr. Kennan, embodies a 
whole range of ideas that forty years ago had 
hardly found their way into the consciousness 
of writers upon political and sociological prob- 
lems. In fact, there was no "sociology" in 
those days, and political science scorned those 
studies in primitive organization that are now 
its very life-blood. "The Old View of Child- 
hood and the New" presents a contrast that

could hardly have been imagined at a time 
when all views of childhood were indistin- 
guishably old, and when pedagogy had not yet 
reared its head among the arts. As for a story 
of " Twenty-five Years' Progress in Equatorial 
Africa," if told at all in 1857, it would have 
been either like the story of "a cycle of 
Cathay," or a bold essay in romantic fiction. 
At that time there were no " Recent Discov- 
eries Respecting the Origin of the Universe," 
for the instrument was unknown that should 
first make such discoveries possible ; and there 
could not have been any discussion of "The 
Upward Movement in Chicago," for there was 
no Chicago worth viewing from such a stand- 
point. Finally, we may remark that the very 
interesting article entitled " Forty Years of the 
Atlantic Monthly " could hardly have had a 
prototype even of the prospective sort, in the 
first year of the magazine's history, for no 
prophetic vision could have foreseen that the 
problem offered by the material subduing of 
a new continent was to be succeeded by the 
infinitely more difficult problem of subduing 
its rapidly expanding population to the decen- 
cies and the amenities of civilized life, or that 
the "Atlantic Monthly" would become so po- 
tent an agency in the performance of that latter 
gigantic task. 



LITERARY VAL UES. 

A few years ago it was widely conceded that 
Robert Louis Stevenson had invented style, that 
Tolstoi had discovered human nature, and that 
Herbert Spencer had said the last word about the 
problem of the universe. Dissentients there were, 
indeed, who held that Flaubert was really the first 
writer who had ever properly expressed himself, that 
the Goncourts had dug up those " human documents" 
we have heard so much about, and that Renan had 
given the final thrust to theology and philosophy 
with his dagger of ironical condescension. 

It has always been so, I suppose. In the forties 
they were wondering where Macaulay " got that 
style," and had little doubt that Dickens had super- 
seded Shakespeare. It is with literature as with 
the weather our memories are short, and every 
season is the hottest or the wettest we have known. 
Now, however, that we are nearing our century's 
end, there is noticeable a pause, a lull in our lauda- 
tion of ourselves. We are beginning to wonder 
how our time will appear at the roll-call of the ages. 
Modernity in literature is a taking bait. People 
have a natural prejudice for reading about them- 
selves and their sons-in-law. They like to see in 
print familiar names and places. But after all, the 
main things we have to write about are the perma- 



nent facts of nature, and the emotions, thoughts, and 
actions of our unchanging humanity. An author 
who tries to create a literature out of his own head 
may be modern, but he is not like to become immor- 
tal. Even the decalogue promises long life to those 
who honor their fathers and their mothers. 

There are authors like Spinoza and Kant, who 
have, of course, no concern with the concrete mani- 
festations of character, and who might as well ex- 
press themselves in algebraic symbols as in common 
language for all they have to do with style, yet who, 
nevertheless, have that in their thought which lifts 
their works out of the category of the mere litera- 
ture of knowledge, the dull domain of facts, and 
places them among the proud imaginations of man- 
kind. There are authors, like Le Sage and Dumas 
and Jane Austen, who have hardly an idea to their 
backs, and no more style than is needed to tell a 
story rapidly and plainly, yet whose creative force 

power over essential human nature is so pro- 
digious that " Gil Bias " and " The Three Guards- 
men " and " Pride and Prejudice " are like to last 
as long as men read. And of course there are au- 
thors, like Gray, who coin the commonplaces of the 
world into words of gold. 

Style is not single but complex. It is hard to 
catch it in the act, to fix this Cynthnia of the min- 
ute in any one toilet. As far as prose is concerned, 
style seems to be a vivid realization of all that can 
be said on a subject and an apt selection of the most 
telling points. It certainly does not consist in hunt- 
ing for fine words. Mr. Pater, in his essay on 
Style, concentrates his attention on a single writer 

Gustave Flaubert ; and lovingly describes his 
agonies of composition. A greater master of ex- 
pression than Flaubert, John Keats, says of poetry 
that if it did not come easily it had better not come 
at all. Keats, in the old phrase, corrected his 
verses with care, but he made no fuss about it. We 
do not correct our verse or prose to-day ; we strive 
for the " ultimate word," the " chiseled phrase," the 
" enamelled expression," and record our struggles 
with complacency, as if the contortions of the 
Sybil were of more importance than the oracle she 
has to utter. Still speaking of prose, the more we 
regard style the more it resolves itself into mental 
endowments, thought, imagination and so forth. I 
open a story of Mr. Stevenson's who, if not the 
first of writers, is a very good one I open " Mark- 
heim " or " The Pavilion on the Links," and what 
do I find ? An original and audacious way of look- 
ing at things, and much richness of experience and 
imagination. He has plenty of the bank-notes of 
thought in his pocket, and does not have to make 
one idea do the work of ten. Mere terseness and 
happiness of language follow as naturally as the day 
the sun. A great deal of modern prose, however, 
is given up to the attempt to do more than exhibit 
what the author has inside him. It tries to rival 
painting in rendering nature, and music in repro- 
ducing sound, and is so delicate of scent that, as 
Catullus says, you wish you were all one nose.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Marini and Gongora and the Pre'cieuses of Moliere 
are re-born in every generation. There are styles to- 
day which can only be understood through the pores. 

Poetry is on quite another footing in regard to 
style. It is a formal art. Something sensuous is 
added to the idea. It is its business to be beautiful, 
its right to be adorned. Prose ought to go straight 
to the mark ; it is the paradox of poetry that in it 
a curved line is the shortest distance between two 
points. Perhaps every poem which has got itself 
remembered has a certain movement which dis- 
tinguishes it from all other verse. It is in this 
matter that poetry has its triumph over prose. 
Prose may be, though it seldom is, as concentrated 
as verse; thought and creative force may express 
themselves as well in one as in the other, but the 
returns, the correspondences, the accelerations, the 
retardations, the discords, and the harmonies of 
verse give it a power to express life itself. It is 
motion made apparent. 

Both in poetry and prose, style seems to demand 
an indescribable union of personality and the past. 
One must be individual, or as a stylist one does not 
exist ; one must be universal, or as a stylist one dies. 
Many can model themselves on the masters, but 
they will fail of style for a lack of that freedom and 
freshness which can only come from some inward 
fount. Many may have a native daring, strength, 
and originality, yet fail of style for want of mod- 
eration and measure. It is necessary to fight for 
one's own hand, yet to follow a flag which has led 
the generations. Dr. Johnson, in the mass of his 
work, tried to write Latin prose in English, and 
achieved no style. Carlyle, in "Sartor Resartus," 
threw aside all reasonable restraints of language, 
and achieved no style. It is a narrow bridge to 
walk, and there is an abyss on either hand. 

To have style is to be of equal validity with nat- 
ural things, to be as strong as winds and tides and 
sunbeams ; to have creative power is to be as a god. 
It is an uncalculable thing to create a real human 
being, and to create a world is more than to con- 
quer one. An appearance of the gift is common 
enough. Mimicry and observation will do the trick. 
Readers are quite ready to make believe ; and as 
children christen a stick or a rag, and read into it 
all the qualities of a living baby, so grown folk 
accept from their novelists or their historians who 
are only novelists who plagiarize their plots and do 
not have to invent names for their characters 
labelled dummies, and for the instant think that 
they are alive. But a genuine creation is a different 
thing. It is a magnet of tremendous strength, and 
tends to draw all minds to it and make them like 
itself. Achilles created Greece in his own image, 
and Hamlet has almost absorbed Germany. 

There are many bad ways of creating character. 
Our contemporary trick of dialect and local color 
must have been the invention of a lazy writer who 
wished to make other people write his books for 
him. The exploitation of what is called a " type " 
is another feeble method. The moment an author 



looks upon another human being from a superior 
point of view, and hails him as a " type," he ceases 
to have any power over him. The old method of 
" humors " practiced by Ben Johnson had a better 
reason in it, though of course it was quite false. 
Of all the amazing methods of creation, however, 
that produced by Victor Hugo was the queerest. 
He went by recipe so many ingredients to such a 
result. Some of his explanations as to how he made 
his characters read like directions for compounding 
an omelette or a sauce ! Character in analysis is 
the last infirmity of minds which are almost genu- 
inely creative. It is so near life, it betrays as a rule 
such knowledge of human nature, that one is tempted 
to take it for what it seems. But in the main it is 
a puzzle put together only to be taken apart. 

Invention is not enough, observation is not 
enough. Great as Hawthorne is, there is a quality 
of cold curiosity in his dealings with some of his 
creatures which is as repellant in effect as a surgical 
operation. Enthusiasm and admiration are neces- 
sary even in satire. One half of Dryden's charac- 
ters of Rochester and Shaftesbury, and of Pope's 
Addison and Villiers, are superb and unmeasured 
eulogy. What the poet or novelist needs to do is 
to draw his creation into his soul live in it and 
feel for it the love that mothers bear for their chil- 
dren, whether they are good or evil. This method 
has the one disadvantage that it stamps something 
of the creator's personality upon the creation, so 
that all Shakespeare's men are poets and all Mo- 
liere's wits. The fact that an author has enjoyed 
a character is one test of its reality. Jane Austen 
evidently delighted in her curates, whereas Char- 
lotte BrontS half hated and wholly dispised hers. 
The difference is felt. There is hardly anyone in 
Shakespeare's world villains, criminals, or fools 
included whom he did not evidently love, hardly 
any one against whom he would have been willing 
to draw an indictment. 

It is curious, indeed, that wickedness and weak- 
ness force themselves to the front as the protago- 
nists of almost every drama. Great literature is the 
biography of criminals and fools. Average moral- 
ity and average intelligence are not the stuff out of 
which to create characters that will interest. Evil, 
indeed, seems to be the energetic force of the uni- 
verse, and is the cause of the obstacles and collis- 
ions from which events spring. Every great cre- 
ative poet is a Manichaean. In spite of himself, 
Milton was forced to make the devil his hero ; and 
Richardson was shocked to discover that his Love- 
lace was a most attractive monster. The populace 
are willing to pay for crime. Nothing sells a news- 
paper like a murder. Even in the natural world, 
those lurid villians of nature's melodrama, the light- 
ning and the storm, get infinitely more spectators 
than the milder and beneficent agencies of sunlight 
and dew. Goethe said that he had learned from Poly- 
gnotus that our business on this earth was to enact 
hell. Except Poe and Hawthorne, no American 
writer has ever had any suspicion of this fact. Ever

since that adventure in Boston Harbor, there has 
been a flavor of tea in all New England literature. 

One test of a creation is to note whether it is per- 
fectly clear and understandable. If it is, it prob- 
ably is a bad piece of work, a puppet moved by 
wheels and pulleys, and warranted to do the same 
thing whenever wound up. About the greatest fig- 
ures in fiction, there is something of mystery, some 
possibilities of the unexpected. We do not under- 
stand them thoroughly, any more than we under- 
stand our neighbors or ourselves. Goethe's Hamlet 
is the real one, but so is Coleridge's, and Hazlitt's, 
and Kean's, and Booth's, and Irving's, and yours 
and mine. However diverse and contradictory these 
different impressions are, they are all aspects of the 
one mighty and mysterious figure which is forever 
veiled from full view. 

Thought and thinkers have gone a good deal out 
of favor of late. We have acquired a practical 
turn of mind, and our crowned contemporaries are 
not metaphysicians or preachers, but electricians 
and the like. Foe, who was a great critic in his 
own lines, conducted a life-long polemic against 
didacticism and metaphysics. It is curious to note, 
though, that he is perhaps the most metaphysical 
poet in the whole range of literature. The concepts 
of Time and Space, Birth and Decay, Being and 
Non-Being, wander up and down his works like 
ghosts in a deserted house. Herein lies his superi- 
ority to Hawthorne, whose speculations were theo- 
logical, and exercised mainly on the question of sin 
and redemption, hardly touching the wider prob- 
lem of Evil. However it has come about, the pro- 
found subjects that have engaged literature for all 
ages are tabooed to it, and writers are bidden to 
seek lighter and more objective themes. And why ? 
The abstract is not the didactic. To think in poetry 
does not imply that you are going to turn Adam 
Smith into rhyme. Abstractions lie at the root of 
life, and we cannot produce the flower without 
planting the slip in the ground. Man must think, 
or sink to the level of the animals. He is fighting 
in the dark, thrusting and parrying against an ob- 
scure opponent, and he does not know whether it is 
named Annihilation or Immortality. Granted that 
the problems that rise about us are insoluable by 
any system of speculation, yet by facing them man 
will at least realize his soul, which by forgetting 
them will die out of him. 

Arnold, in his essay on Wordsworth, condemns 
the poetry of revolt. But what great literature is 
there which is not the literature of revolt? Ideal 
poetry and satire spring alike from one root a pro- 
found dissatisfaction with ordinary life. Job com- 
plains, and Achilles sulks in anger, and Prometheus 
rebels, and Faust makes pact with the Enemy, and 
Alceste in proud honesty wishes to leave the world, 
and Don Juan, with indomitable will, wishes to ruin 
it. Everywhere there is revolt and upheaval. What 
is the secret of those proud and melancholy souls, 
the great poets, which so embitters them with life? 
Is it not that they carry within them a standard of 



perfection and greatness, measured by which the 
world stands condemned? The world knows very 
well how to protect itself from its disgusted great 
men. Homer and Dante were compelled to be little 
better than tramps ; Shakespeare and Moliere were, 
by the law of the land, vagabonds, and in a day 
when they hanged that sort of people in order, I 
suppose, to give them some visible means of support. 
But the ideal and standard of the poet always ends 
in prevailing, in being accepted though never in 
being realized. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



COMMUNICA TION. 

"AN INQUIRENDO INTO THE WIT AND OTHER 

GOOD PARTS" OF CERTAIN WRITERS. 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

Is it too late for another word about " Patrins " ? Mr. 
Hale, in his article on the book and its author in THE 
DIAL of September 16, seems to agree with Wetherell's 
criticism of the Inquirendo: " It is well, lopsided ; and 
so mortal serious you know," but may we not quite fairly 
add his conclusion: "Not that it isn't great fun, too. 
You will carry the audience." 

Mr. William Dean Howells argues quite convincingly 
that it is not within the province of the critic to decide 
whether a story is worth telling, but whether it is well 
told : he is to say whether it is good of its kind, not 
whether the kind is to his personal liking. Therefore, 
if a man deliberately announces, " I go a-gypseying," 
we need not apply strictly commercial tests to his 
gleanings, or insist that he bring back with him a bag 
of wheat, threshed and winnowed of chaff. Bather 
does not the declaration stir something within us to 
respond, " We also go with thee," as when your favorite 
playmate used to say, " C 'm on : le 's go somewhere." 
Life has other staples than wheat, and there is both 
value and delight in mint and bramble-berries, and that 
nondescript plunder with which Nature entices her chil- 
dren into the "Great Playground." 

We never outgrow the idyllic delights of sauntering, 
of simply going somewhere outside of beaten paths; cut- 
ting switches for the pleasant feel of the smooth bark; 
watching the minnows at the footbridge, and leaning 
with delicious tremors over the deep hole by the hem- 
lock ; turning aside for sweet-flag and choke-cherries, 
browsing on spicy birch twigs, sprouting beech-mast, 
slippery-elm bark, or whatever wild delicacy may be in 
season. Does any man grow up properly who never 
filled a torn hat with small, russetty sugar-sweetings and 
lay blissfully in the warm stubble to munch them and 
fling the cores at a grey spot on the gnarled trunk ? 
"Going somewhere," with no thought of arriving; "do- 
ing nothing out of doors " but healthily busy in fellow- 
ship with the great universe of things that are leisurely 
ripening, and soaking full of sweetness and sunshine. 
There is need of plowing and sowing and gathering into 
barns, but this is the legitimate " return of the native " 
to the patrimony inherited from Eden before the trouble- 
some specification about " the sweat of thy brow," was 
inserted in the title-deeds.

these excursions, discoursing meanwhile in such whim- 
sical fashion that the veriest plodder must smile

indulgently as he turns from his task to listen, even 
though she mocks at his ambition and reviles his 
assumptions. He need not take her altogether in earn- 
est or insist that the stone she throws at pretentious 
learning is really aimed at kindly wisdom, insensibly 
diffusing its atmosphere of peace. To be able to carry 
the " patrimony of liberal education along with one as 
a sure and inseparable treasure," without " feeling it 
any burden or incumbrance " this surely is not to turn 
traitor to one's opportunities or be disqualified for good 
citizenship, and if we confess that Miss Guiney's " lib- 
eral education " in the wit and wisdom of the Eliza- 
bethans is sometimes an incumbrance to her talk, we 
need not deny her the " power of thought and the power 
of style." Is this really a trifling age in which men are 
in danger of turning aside at every tempting stile to 
stroll in flowery meadows when they should be girding 
up their loins and addressing themselves seriously to 
their journey ? Are there not more than enough serious 
books, considering that we ourselves do not wish to 
read them, but only feel that their perusal would benefit 
our neighbors ? " The Great Playground " never seemed 
so attractive ; the " Harmless Scholar " is infinitely fas- 
cinating, and we feel sure it was he who, in some happy 
moment, dreamed out the true " Ethics of Descent." 
Is " Quiet London " a misnomer ? But who knows Lon- 
don if not Mr. Henry James, and has he not declared 
that in London alone one may find a typical and abso- 
lutely perfect rural walk, over such velvet turf, under 
such majestic trees, that he longs to be a department 
clerk, compelled to traverse its delightful way morning 
and evening. 

" Puppy " and " A Fine Gentleman " are improving 
acquaintances, worthy to be named in the same category 
with many a literary politician; certainly they do not 
discredit " His Late Majesty " by their manners or 
morals. We even prefer their companionship to that 
of royalty, and could wish that Miss Guiney in her gyp- 
seying had gone oftener afield through the green lanes 
frequented by such nnpatented nobility, leaving King 
Charles to his parks and pleasure grounds, but even so 
we feel she is quite sure to " carry the audience."

THE INCOMMUNICABLE TREES.' 



We hear the ocean's open roar, 

The burdened surging; aye the sea 

Uplifts his passion, mightily 

It wakes, the round of his great shore. 

The loud sky shouts her secrecy, 

The hill makes moan, rock-ribbed and hoar; 

Sea, sky, and hill far forth these three 

Pour out their souls forevermore. 

With us, with us, it is not so. 

To brooding music move our leaves, 

In purl and murmur on and on 

Flow subtile numbers, lulling, low, 

Half- heard, scarce come ere they are gone; 

A mystic stir forever weaves, 

The Presence passes to and fro, 

The yearning stillness joys and grieves; 

But our high calm strive not to hear, 

This our deep peace hope not to know.

SIR HARRY JOHNSTON IN BRITISH 
CJCNTRAL, AFRICA.* 

The region somewhat pretentiously styled 
British Central Africa lies north of the Zambesi 
and in the South Central part of the continent^ 
and is bounded on the north by Lake Tangan- 
yika and the Congo Free State, on the north- 
east by German East Africa, and on the east, 
south-east, and west by Portuguese posses- 
sions. Politically the country is divided into 
Sphere of Influence and Protectorate the 
former division being administered under the 
charter of the British South Africa Company, 
the latter under the Imperial Government di- 
rectly. The Sphere of Influence is much 
larger than the actual Protectorate, which ia 
chiefly confined to the districts bordering on 
Lake Nyasa and on the river Shire. The chief 
agent in bringing this region under British 
control was Sir Harry H. Johnston, the accom- 
plished and versatile author of the volume now 
before us. The ambitious title " British Cen- 
tral Africa" was, it seems, prospectively (and, 
as it turned out, prematurely) conferred by Sir 
Harry, who hoped at the time that it would 
cover a larger and, politically, a much more im- 
portant district than it now does. As he says : 

" On the principle that it is disastrous to a dog's in- 
terest to give him a bad name, it should be equally true 
that much is gained at the outset of any enterprise by 
bestowing on it a promising title. I therefore chose 
that of ' British Central Africa ' because I hoped the 
new sphere of British influence might include much of 
Central Africa where, at the time these deeds were done, 
the territories of foreign powers were in a state of flux, 
no hard and fast boundaries having been determined j 
therefore by fair means Great Britain's share north of 
the Zambesi might be made to connect her Protectorate 
on the Upper Nile with her Empire south of the Zam- 
besi." 

Eventually, however, the well-laid schemes 
of the author and his political chiefs looking to 
continuity of British possessions went u a-gley," 
the boundaries of German East Africa and of 
the Congo Free State becoming conterminous 
in the district north of Tanganyika, an arrange- 
ment which interposed a strip of foreign terri- 
tory between British Central Africa and the 
English Protectorate to the north of it. En- 
gland secured from Germany a right of way 
across the intervening strip a mere easement

granted by the terms of the Anglo-German 
Convention. Similarly the Belgian agents were 
able to establish their claims to the country 
west and southwest of Tanganyika ; so that 
British Central Africa, so far from attaining 
the territorial limits and relations to which its 
founder originally aspired, is now a compara- 
tively isolated inland country having free ac- 
cess to the sea only by a navigable river under 
international control, and forming a nearly 
exact geographical parallel to the State of Para- 
guay in South America. 

The present work deals only with that east- 
ern portion of British Central Africa which 
came within the author's personal experience, 
that is to say it is mainly confined to the reg- 
ions bordering on Lakes Tanganyika and the 
Shire river. Of these comparatively little 
known regions it gives by far the fullest, weight- 
iest, and most entertaining account that has yet 
appeared. The narrative and descriptive por- 
tions of the work are as a whole admirably 
done they are so well done, indeed, that one 
regrets the more a certain rather trifling or 
flippant note that crops out in them occasion- 
ally, and tends to lower the tone of a scholarly 
and in some respects even brilliant book. It 
will prove something of a shock, for instance, 
to the serious reader to find an eminent natur- 
alist and geographer suddenly dropping the 
thread of his recital to refresh himself with a 
quite irrelevant scrap of doggerel, such as this : 
" There are all sorts of girls, there is every kind of girl, 
There are some that are foolish, and many that are wise ; 
You can trust them all. no doubt, but be careful to look out 
For the harmless little girlie with the downcast eyes." 
No book is the worse for humor ; but humor, 
like Sir Harry Johnston's " girls," has its sorts 
and kinds. 

The author has treated his theme with ency- 
clopaedic fulness, as a glance at the table of 
contents indicates. Chapter I. tells us, by 
means of a vividly picturesque series of typical 
set scenes and panoramas, " What the Country 
Looks Like." The succeeding eleven chapters 
discuss severally the " Physical Geography of 
the Country " ; its " History " (which really 
begins with Livingstone, though the author 
hazards some interesting conjectures as to its 
remote past, based on researches into language, 
examination of racial types, traditions, etc.); the 
" Slave Trade "; " European Settlers "; " Mis- 
sionaries "; " Botany "; Zoology "; " The Na- 
tives "; " Languages." Much detailed infor- 
mation, mainly scientific, is contained in the 
Appendices to the several chapters. The au- 
thor's turn for scientific pursuits and political 



enterprises is coupled with an artist's sense of 
the beauties of nature and an artist's delight 
in depicting them. This dualism of tempera- 
ment, if we may so style it, lends his book its pe- 
culiar character. The volume reveals by turns 
the man of sensibility, and the man of hard 
facts. It seems as if Sir Harry were possessed 
alternately of the spirit of Michelet, and the 
spirit of " Mr. Gradgrind." Of his pictorial 
style a set scene or two from his opening pano- 
rama of Central African scenery may serve as 
examples. 

" A steadily flowing river. In the middle of the 
stream an islet of very green grass, so lush and 90 thick 

that there are no bright lights or sharp shadows 

simply a great splodge of rich green in the middle of 
the shining water which reflects principally the whitish- 
blue of the sky ; though this general tint becomes opal- 
ine and lovely as mother-of-pearl, owing to the swirling 
of the current and the red-gold color of the concealed 
sand-banks which in shallow places permeates the reflec- 
tions. Near to the right side of the grass islet separ- 
ated only by a narrow mauve-tinted band of water is a 
sand- bank that has been uncovered, and on this stands a 
flock of perhaps three dozen small white egrets closely 
packed, momentarily immoveable, and all stiffly regard- 
ant of the approaching steamer, each bird with a gen- 
eral similarity of outline almost Egyptian in its monot- 
onous repetition. The steamer approaches a little 
nearer, and the birds rise from the sand-bank with a 
loose flapping flight and strew themselves over the land- 
scape like a shower of large white petals. . . . The 
afternoon is well advanced, and in the eastern sky, which 
is a warm pinkish blue, the full moon has already risen 
and hangs there a yellow- white shield with no radiance. 
On the opposite bank of the river to the palm trees is a 
clump of tropical forest of the richest greeu with purple 
shadows, lovely and seductive in its warm tints under 
the rays of the late afternoon sun. . . . Tiny king- 
fishers of purple- blue and chestnut-orange flit through 
the dark net-work of gnarled trunks, and deep in this 
recess of shade small night-herons and bitterns stand 
bolt upright, so confident of their invisibility against a 
back-ground of brown and grey that they do not move 
even when the steamer passes so close by them as to 
brush against the tangle of convolvulus and knock down 
sycamore figs from the glossy-leaved, many-rooted fig 
trees." 

The following transports us to the moon-lit 
depths of a Hyphasne palm forest. 

"... Each palm is surmounted by a graceful crown 
of fan-shaped leaves in an almost symmetrical oval 
mass, radiating from the summit as from a centre. The 
fruit which is clustered thickly on racemes is seen by 
daylight a bright chestnut brown and the size of a 
Jaffa orange. This brown husk covering an ivory nut 
is faintly sweet to the taste and is adored by elephants. 
It is on that account that I have brought you here to 
see with the eye of the spirit a herd of these survivors 
of past geological epochs. Somehow or other it seems 
more fitting that we should see the wild elephant by 
moonlight at this present day. He is like a ghost 
revisiting the glimpses of the moon this huge grey 
bulk, wrinkled even in babyhood, with his monstrous 
nose, his monstrous ears and his extravagant incisor

teeth. . . . Now you hear the noise they make an 
occasional reverberating rattle through the proboscis as 
they examine objects on the ground half seriously, half 
playfully ; and the swishing they make as they pass 
through the herbage ; or the rustle of branches which 
are being plucked to be eaten. But they are chiefly bent 
on the ginger-bread nuts of the palms and to attain 
these, where they hang out of reach, they will pause 
occasionally to butt the palm trees with their flattened 
foreheads. The dried stems and the dead fronds crash 
down before this jarring blow. The elephants pause 
every now and then in their feasting, the mothers to 
suckle their little ones, a huge bull to caress a young 
female with his twining trunk, or the childless cows to 
make semblance of fighting, and the half-grown young 
to chase each other with shrill trumpetings. Before the 
first pale pink light of early dawn the moonlight seems 
an unreality. In a few minutes the moon is no more 
luminous than a round of dirty paper and with the yel- 
low radiance of day the elephants cease their gambol- 
lings and feasting, form into line, and swing into one of 
those long marches which will carry them over sixty 
miles of forest, plain and mountain to the next halting- 
place in their seeming-purposeful journey." 

British Central Africa is a well-wooded coun- 
try, especially in the Nyasa province, though 
here and there on the line of water parting 
between the river systems there are compara- 
tively barren spots, where the trees are poor 
and scrubby and the plants grow in scattered 
tufts. There is nowhere any large unbroken 
area of the dense tropical forest characteristic 
of Western Africa ; but in the moister districts 
there are occasional patches of woodland quite 
West-African in character, and containing, 
moreover, certain trees, birds, and mammals 
hitherto believed to be peculiar to that region. 
From this and other facts the author is led to 
surmise that "the whole of Africa was once 
covered with more or less dense forest, but that 
the climate in the eastern half being drier than 
in the west, the ravages of the bush fires started 
by man have made greater headway than the 
reparatory influence of nature." The geology 
of the country seems to be relatively simple. 
The commonest formation is a mixture of met- 
amorphic rocks, grauwacke, clay- slates, gneiss 
and schists. The principal mountain ranges 
are mostly granite. In the stream valleys and 
depressions, especially in the Nyasaland prov- 
inces, is found the black "cotton" soil (a 
deposit of the shells of molluscs mixed with 
black vegetable earth), so highly valued in 
India, and which is usually extremely rich for 
cultivation. In the sandstone formation of the 
West Shire district and round the northern 
half of Nyasa, coal is found a little shaley 
on the surface, but probably overlying good 
combustible coal. As to gold, to the Anglo- 
Saxon adventurer driven by the auri sacra 



fames, British Central Africa appears to hold 
out (as yet) no especially glittering bait. 

"In the Marimba and Central Angoniland districts, 
also in the mountains of the West Nyasa coast region, 
and in parts of the Shire Highlands, a gold-beariug 
quartz exists. Alluvial gold is reported to exist on the 
Northern Angoni plateau, in the West Nyasa district, 
and at the head-waters of the River Bua, just within 
the Protectorate. In the valleys of the rivers flowing 
south to the Zambesi (in Mpezeni's country) gold really 
does exist, and was worked at Misale by the half-caste 
Portugese in the last, and in part of the present cent- 
ury. Although there are many reports that payable 
gold has been found in the rock, which only needs the 
requisite machinery to crush out, at anything from 10 
dwts. to 1 oz. per ton, no conclusive evidence has yet 
been offered to support these statements by specimens 
which can be submitted to analysis." 

In the interesting chapter on " Missionaries" 
the author discusses in a very candid, and, as he 
claims, impartial way the character and value 
of missionary work in Central Africa. Im- 
primis he declares that " No person who desires 
to make a truthful statement would deny the 
great good effected by missionary enterprise " 
in that country. This good appears to him, 
as we gather, to be mainly of the secular and 
practical kind the essentially religious re- 
sults of missionary labor (as indicated by the 
numbers of real converts made) being rela- 
tively small. Hence, it seems probable to Sir 
Harry that when the history of the great Afri- 
can states of the future comes to be written 
the early missionary will figure therein prim- 
arily as the temporal, rather than the spiritual, 
guide of the natives, and as the bearer of use- 
ful European arts and handicrafts to a be- 
nighted continent. All of which, one may 
suggest in passing, will depend largely upon 
the mental attitude of the future historian and 
his generation toward the general question in- 
volved. Says the author : 

" The pioneering propagandist will assume [in fu- 
ture history] somewhat of the character of a Quetzal- 
coatl one of those strange half-mythical personal- 
ities which figure in the legends of old American 
empires; the beneficent being who introduced arts and 
manufactures, implements of husbandry, edible fruits, 
medical drugs, cereals, domestic animals. ... It is 
they (the missionaries) too who in many cases have first 
taught the natives carpentry, joinery, masonry, tailor- 
ing, cobbling, engineering, bookkeeping, printing, and 
European cookery ; to say nothing of reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and a smattering of general knowledge. . . . 
At the Government press at Zomba there is but one 
European superintendent all the other printers being 
mission-trained natives. Most of the telegraph stations 
are entirely worked by negro telegraph clerks also de- 
rived from the missions." 

We are to conclude, then, that the verdict 
of the impartial observer of missionary work 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



181 



in Central Africa must be almost wholly in its 
favor. The author finds, nevertheless, that 
there exists in some quarters a bitter prejudice 
against the missionaries, and a tendency to deny 
or to disparage their services. The causes of 
this feeling, he concludes, are two : 

" (1) The Cant which, by some unaccountable fatal- 
ity, seems to be inseparably connected with missionary 
work, and (2) the arrogant demeanor often assumed 
by missionaries toward men who are not of their man- 
ner of thought and practice, though not necessarily men 
of evil life." 

Sir Harry's charges as to " cant " and " ar- 
rogant demeanor " are doubtless not altogether 
ill-founded in a certain proportion of individual 
cases ; but it will probably be objected that 
in thus broadly explaining the existence of the 
prejudice in question he takes account only of 
the ways and character of those who are the 
objects of it, without at all troubling himself 
to look into the ways and character of those 
who harbor it ; and that an explanation thus 
grounded is at best only half an explanation. 
To fully understand why the Central African 
missionaries are disliked " in some quarters," 
and to decide fairly just how much or how 
little they are themselves to blame for it, we 
must first know who it is that dislikes them. 
Certain incidental admissions of our author's 
seem to throw a little light on this point. He 
remarks, apropos of the alleged " arrogant de- 
meanor " of the missionaries, that the average 
European (lay) pioneers are not " very credit- 
able specimens of mankind. 

" They are aggressively ungodly, they put no check 
on their lusts; released from the restraints of civiliza- 
tion and the terror of ' what people may say,' they are 
capable of almost any degree of wickedness." 

Such being the character of a large contin- 
gent of the white population of British Central 
Africa, the prejudice there against missionaries 
seems explicable on other grounds than those 
given by Sir Harry. The missionary is not 
likely to be a universally popular man in a 
community largely made up of " aggressively 
ungodly " people, to whom his presence is a 
restraint and his ways are a rebuke and to 
whom, moreover, all profession of piety is 
" cant," and who would naturally resent a decent 
attitude of official aloofness from loose ways 
and loose company as savoring of " arrogant 
demeanor " and the spiritual conceit of the 
" unco guid." In point of fact, there is, as it 
seems to us, a fundamental rivalry between the 
African missionaries and the army of self-seek- 
ing or merely nomadic adventurers now stream- 
ing thither in the wake of the Rhodeses, Jame- 



sons, and Barnatos. What dreams of future 
theocratic states in Africa the more ambitious 
missionaries may not unreasonably have cher- 
ished before the tide of European invasion set 
in, we do not know ; but there is evidently still 
a clash of aims and ideals between the mis- 
sionaries and the political agents who are 
wrangling over and parcelling out the land 
and, incidentally, shoving aside or shooting 
down the original holders of it. Even the 
godly Boer, trusting in providence and his rifle, 
treats the black man as a mere beast of burden. 
In fine, to the missionary Africa is primarily 
the Lord's vineyard where the Lord's work 
is to be done ; to almost everybody else who 
goes out there it is a vast field for political and 
commercial exploitation, where a good deal of 
even devil's work may be done, if only the use- 
ful end is likely to be secured thereby. The 
African must, and should, give way before the 
" Africander." But it is in the meantime 
rather hard for the missionary to see his once 
special province overrun and his pious toil 
among the heathen threatened with undoing 
by industrial civilization's advance guard of 
largely graceless adventurers, who have little of 
civilization to bestow upon the black man save 
the contagion of its vices. 

The volume is an exceptionally handsome 
one, profusely and beautifully illustrated from 
drawings by the author and from photographs. 
Sir Harry's experiences of things African is 
perhaps more thorough and many-sided than 
that of any other living authority ; and the 
reader who is interested in things African is 
not likely to find a dull or an uninstructive 
page in his book.

ART AND LIFE.* 



The relation of literature to life or, one 
might as well say, of art to life is a very 
important question. A question it has been 
since Aristotle, and a question it will remain 
until someone has either genius enough to 
divine the adequate answer or scholarship 
enough to work the answer out. And it is 
important, because nowadays art is becoming 
a very great possibility in life, a possibility 
which if rightly used may amount to much. 

As the young American grows up, one of

the great circumstances which comes some- 
how to his notice is infallibly Art. Religion, 
Learning, Science, Politics, Society, Work, 
Athletics, each one of these, of varying kind 
and in varying degree, is one of the things that 
go to make up the surrounding of circumstance 
wherein he developes. Each may help him to 
make of himself what he does make of himself. 
Art of some kind is as universal as these other 
circumstances, and is said by many to be as 
useful, if one can avail oneself of it. An enor- 
mous literature is at everybody's command ; 
the theatre is open to very many ; music is only 
a little less accessible, and in some forms is 
even more accessible ; pictures are not so uni- 
versal, but still are not uncommon ; statues 
may be found by the earnest seeker, and here 
and there one sees architecture. Nobody can 
entirely avoid art, and nobody tries to do so. 
Everybody has some dealings with art. How 
many make it a thing of real good to them ? 
How many are really influenced by it? 

The novel is at present the most omnipresent 
form of literature. It is a prevalent opinion 
that novel-reading may have bad results. But 
except in one direction, few seem to imagine 
that novel-reading may have good results. 
That one direction points toward direct teach- 
ing conveyed by fiction. Without discussing 
the real value of novels with a purpose, we 
may ask, Are there many novel-readers who 
are aware that they may be influenced, if they 
choose, by the novel as literature? 

There are in our country numerous literary 
clubs. In how many of them is literature re- 
garded as a moulding power, and in how many 
is it conceived as a repository of facts ? Some 
literary clubs make literature a much more 
interesting and amusing thing than it was be- 
fore ; some show that it will reward the earnest 
student with a delightful form of mental exer- 
cise ; and we hope that there are some that 
give their members the idea that literature 
may, if they choose, be a matter of vital and 
eternal service to them. 

Our colleges and universities, without ex- 
ception, maintain professors of literature. 
Some of these professors have succeeded in 
making it clear that modern literature contains 
as many matters which may be made the sub- 
ject of scholarly research as do the classics. 
Others have succeeded in arousing in their 
students a sort of high-pitched idealism which 
is fascinating in college, although sometimes 
forgotten when once out of it. Is there more 
than one, most unacademic of professors that 



he is, whose students cannot escape from the 
consciousness that literature may be the breath 
of life to the spirit? 

We think that Americans are, as a people, 
practical enough to make some use of litera- 
ture, if they see that it can be of use in the 
everyday solutions of the problems of living. 
We think that literature is nothing to them 
because they have no idea of what it may be. 
We think it the duty of our chief literary 
critics to tell them the truth on this subject. 

The three great English critics of our gen- 
eration, Matthew Arnold, Walter Pater, John 
luiskin, had each his theory on this matter, 
definite enough to be understood without great 
difficulty. Even the critics of secondary rank, 
John Addington Symonds, Vernon Lee, Fred- 
eric Harrison, are continually revolving the 
question. Being men of letters and not scien- 
tists, they do not always go about the business 
in the most direct and systematic manner ; still, 
they go about it seriously in ways of their own. 

It is a fault of American criticism that it 
has not as yet had very much to say upon the 
subject. But now we have two volumes by two 
of our best-known essayists, which at first sight 
would seem to deal with the matter. 

It may be hypercritical to remark, first, that 
neither of the books does deal very fully with 
the matter. Mr. Warner's volume is a collec- 
tion of essays named from the first essay : the 
others " have been selected for their general 
relation to the theme of the title essay, that is 
to say, the connection between our literary, edu- 
cational, and social progress." Colonel Hig- 
ginson's collection is not a collection of " Essays 
on Literature and Life," but of some essays on 
literature and other essays on life or some as- 
pect of it. 

"The Relation of Literature to Life," 
although we have spoken of it as a question, is 
really a very vague matter, and may include 
almost anything. Literature may be an effect 
of Life : so Taine regarded it. It may also be 
regarded as a cause, or an influence : that is 
the view that we have spoken of above, and 
that is the point Mr. Warner considers in his 
first essay and elsewhere. His conclusion 
hardly satisfies us. Literature, he points out, 
is wrongly regarded by the multitude as a 
thing apart from life (p. 19) ; it is really, how- 
ever (p. 22), a thing of immense value to 
everyone. So far, there is nothing to dispute ; 
but why is poetry, literature, art, of value to 
everyone? Because, says Mr. Warner, it is 
" not merely the comfort of the refined and

the delight of the educated ; it is the alleviator 
of poverty, the pleasure-ground of the igno- 
rant, the bright spot in the most dreary pil- 
grimage " (p. 28) : it is a matter " of present 
enjoyment " (p. 49) or of future, its main ob- 
ject is to entertain (p. 151), to lift the burdens 
of life by taking us for a time out of our hum- 
drum and perhaps sordid condition : it is the 
help and solace of the many (p. 117). This 
seems to be Mr. Warner's main opinion : as 
will be noticed, it is expressed in several places. 
We regard it as rather a commonplace idea ; 
it has long been familiar, and it does not in 
itself settle anything. For the fact is that 
some people enjoy good literature and more 
enjoy bad literature. What is really needed is 
something that will show why good literature 
is a better solace than bad. But if art be a 
solace in the hardships of life, how can we be 
satisfied to say that the value of any genuine 
piece of literature is in " the enlargement of 
the mind to a conception of the life and devel- 
opment of the race " (p. 293) ? Is " enlarge- 
ment of the mind " necessarily " a solace " 
amid the hardships of life ? Is it not the next 
step which is the step really worth while ? Why 
not get at the real difficulty ? Why content 
oneself with illustrating views that have already 
been often illustrated ? We do not think that 
Mr. Warner solves the question when he ad- 
vises that a taste for good literature be incul- 
cated in the common schools. The trouble is 
that the youthful mind does not always take 
naturally to good literature, and the average 
common-school teacher is not always able to 
show that good literature is something really to 
be desired. Take it all in all, although we 
have only touched the central point, Mr. War- 
ner does not do much toward making clear 
what part literature must have in life : what he 
says has been said before, and does not touch 
the really difficult point. 

Colonel Higginson does not give us even as 
much help as Mr. Warner, the reason being, as 
we have indicated, that he has not anywhere 
made any effort to deal with the subject indi- 
cated by the title of his book. He has merely 
collected a number of his recent essays and 
given them a title which seemed to include 
them all, as it would include almost every- 
thing else. The essays are rather like good 
mellow winter apples ; and we have enjoyed 
them. We disagree with Colonel Higginson's 
apparent view that literature is chiefly valuable 
as a mine of unfamiliar quotations ; but that is 
a minor detail. We think that everybody will 



like to read the book, and that no one will gain 
from it many ideas on the connection between 
literature and life. 

It is a pity, but neither of these books really 
addresses itself to what is an important matter, 
and a matter which they seem to affect to deal 
with. They bring us no farther on the way. 
They will be read with interest, and soon for- 
gotten ; for though each is the work of a man 
of great talent, neither is a book to be taken 
seriously. Being lightly written, they will be 
lightly read. EDWARD E. HALE, JR.

since accumulated, many must be passed over with- 
out mention, but there remain a score or more that 
shall receive some attention. By virtue of both 
its subject and its excellence, "The Builders and 
Other Poems," by the Rev. Henry Van Dyke, is 
entitled to the first place in the American section 
of the present survey. Mr. Van Dyke can lay no 
claim to great distinction among the host of our 
minor poets, but a great occasion sometimes lifts a 
man above his natural height, and the sesquicen- 
tennial celebration of Princeton University proved 
such an occasion for this sincere and large-souled 
divine. The " Ode " which he recited upon that 
occasion is a fine example of this academic sort of 
composition, and has a considerable inherent value. 
One of its noblest passages is the following : 

"Softly, my harp, and let me lay the touch 
Of silence on these rudely clanging strings ; 

For he who sings 
Even of noble conflicts overmuch. 
Loses the inward sense of better things ; 

And he who makes a boast 

Of knowledge, darkens that which counts the most, 
The insight of a wise humility 
That reverently adores what none can see. 

The glory of our life below 
Comes not from what we do, or what we know, 
But dwells forevermore in what we are. 
There is an architecture grander far 
Than all the fortresses of war, 
More inextinguishably bright 
Than learning's lonely towers of light, 
Framing its walls of faith and hope and love 
In deathless souls of men, it lifts above 
The frailty of our earthly home 

An everlasting dome ; 
The sanctuary of the human host, 
The living triumph of the Holy Ghost." 

The publication of this poem has given the author 
occasion also to collect some half-hundred pages 
of random verse, obviously written with no set pur- 
pose of becoming a poet, but merely as the expres- 
sion of some insistent mood or striking phase of 
natural beauty. It is all very pleasing and in perfect 
good taste, although it never becomes particularly 
impressive. It is such verse as almost any cultured 
thinker of sincere life and high ideals may pro- 
duce from time to time, and for which life is at 
least none the worse, either for the writer or his 
audience. 

Mr. Gilder's new volume is entitled " For the 
Country," and includes poems (some old and some 
new) written for patriotic occasions and in memory 
of our great soldiers. It "is devoted to the idea 
of a vital nationality, and a citizenship as self- 
sacrificing and courageous in peace as in war." 
The American public knows well how unflinchingly 
Mr. Gilder has stood for these civic ideals, and his 
verse is the refined expression of a life that has 
been in the best sense one of service. We some- 
times wish that Mr. Gilder's metres were less un- 
tamed, and that he would not try so many experi- 
ments in stanzaic form, but he always has some- 
thing to say, and his voice is urged by a genuine 
lyrical impulse. That when far from home he is not 



forgetful of his native land is evidenced by these 
verses from " A Winter Twilight in Provence," a 
poem written at the beginning of last year. 

" Dear country mine ! far in that viewless west, 
And ocean-warded, strife thou too hast known ; 
But may thy sun hereafter bloodless shine, 
And may thy way be onward without wrath, 
And upward on no carcase of the slain ; 
And if thou smitest, let it be for peace 
And justice not in hate, or pride, or lust 
Of empire. Mayst thou ever be, O land ! 
Noble and pure as thou art free and strong : 
So shalt thon lift a light for all the world 
And for all time, and bring the Age of Peace." 

It is not difficult to read between the lines of this 
poem dated just at the time of the amazing out- 
burst of jingoism that seemed for a moment to 
threaten a fratricidal war between the two nations 
that, of all nations in the world, have the deepest 
reasons for living in amity and in the common 
possession of a great historical past. 

The widow of the late Timothy Otis Paine has 
published a thin volume of selections from his 
poems which, by their unaffected simplicity and 
their closeness to the heart of nature, at once dis- 
arm criticism and make to their readers an appeal 
of which more elaborate verse often fails. There 
is something very winsome about this description 
of "The Evening Primrose," for example. 
"The primrose blooms at eventide. 
And, where I go, the highway side 
It lights up with its yellow blow : 
What else it does I do not know, 
Except, all day, and, until blowed, 
The bud is gray, with slight perfume, 
Till eve unfold a clean sweet bloom." 

That keenness of observation which, as the prefa- 
tory memoir tells us, " caught the reflection of a 
violet in the clear eyes of a grazing cow," is re- 
vealed in many a pretty versicle of this collection. 
We are sometimes reminded of Emily Dickinson, 
as in the two quatrains called " Good Work." 

" Who praised when sun, moon, star, 
Great earth, and sea spread far 
Were made ? But yet what worth 
From laboring sun, sea, earth ! 

" Put work enough in all 
Thon doest, great or small, 
And let the ages tell 
How much thou didst, and well." 

Still more frequent are the suggestions of Emer- 
son, with whom the author had no slight spiritual 
kinship on the mystical or "transcendental" side. 
His life was that of a Swedenborgian minister and 
a scholar in the ancient tongues. The study of 
Solomon's Temple and the Egyptian " Book of the 
Dead" were to him more serious preoccupations 
than the phenomena of modern life could afford, 
and he once wrote that if he knew anything, it was 
' Ezekiel's heart." He was born in 1824, lived his 
adult life as a pastor in East Bridgewater, Massa- 
chusetts, and died a year or two ago. 

Mr. John James Piatt's volume of verse, mostly 
occasional, has for its leading features two odes, 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

one for the Cleveland Centennial, the other for the 
dedication of the Cincinnati Music Hall. We make 
an extract from the latter : 

" Look, what high guests attend our happy rite, 
With earth-woven wreaths but sphere-enchanted faces, 
The Masters of Delight ! 

First he, of the elder days, 

Whom the great organ owns 

With its vast-bosomed, earth shaking, heaven-reaching tones 
(Let the proud servant throb his loftiest praise !). 
Next he, who built the mighty symphonies, 
One for each muse, who, chaunting joy and peace, 
Thrills us with awe and yearning infinite, 
Picturing divine repose, love's world- embracing height ! 

Then he, whose noblest strain 
Brings Orpheus back to quicken earth again, 
To conquer darkness and the dread under-powers, 
Charming lost love from the deep doors of hell, 
And lo, the choral master, highest in fame 
( A thousand voices lift to greet him well), 
Who breathes sure faith through these frail hearts of ours ! 

And many another well- beloved name, 

Ay, many another, comes with these, 

Star-like, with spheral harmonies : 
Welcome each and all, 
To our festal Hall, 

Long be its music- lifted dome 
For their abiding souls the transient home." 

Mr. Buckham's " The Heart of Life " is a volume 
of the tasteful " Oaten Stops " series. It is a collec- 
tion of simple lyrics of nature, and of the everyday 
moods of life, pretty and facile, but not striking. 
The following is a favorable example : 

" Out of the bosom of God comes the day, 
Flood of the tenderness nothing can stay ; 
Love that up-springing sets the world singing, 
Steeples a- shine and the silver bells ringing. 
Infinite motion of infinite ocean, 
Light but the symbol that broadens for aye, 
Out of the bosom of God comes the day." 

The above remarks may be repeated in the case 

of Mr. Urmy's " Vintage of Verse," except that his 

nature-lyrics are given the local coloring of the 

Pacific coast. One stanza will do as well as a score. 

" The sun has set, and evening skies 

Begin, like rosebuds, to unfold, 
While on the distant mountain-tops 

Still linger faint, stray gleams of gold, 
Like kisses pressed by angel lips 
Or touches of God's finger-tips." 

There is no offense in such verse, and likewise no 
strength. It is merely the echo of a great voice 
reflected a hundred times or more. 

There is some measure of strength, albeit fitfully 
displayed, and some command of the deeper harmo- 
nies of rythmical utterance in the poems modestly 
entitled " Fugitive Lines," by Mr. Henry Jerome 
Stockard. The finer qualities of his verse are dis- 
played in the sonnets, as well as in such a lyric as 
" Fallida Mors," from which we quote a stanza. 

" For thon dost come a friend, 

Or if thou shudder in with cerements stoled, 
Or sweep swart as a Memphian King, or bend 

An angel fair as Titian e'er did feign, 
For thou dost come a friend, since thou wilt hold 

Nepenthe for life's pain 
Unto my lips, and round me fold, 

Like some rich garment, peace that shall not end, 
While days and months and years be onward rolled." 



Mr. Robert W. Chambers has written some rol- 
licking songs " With the Band," so suggestive of 
Mr. Kipling's barrack-room echoes that the reader 
did not need to be reminded of the source of inspi- 
ration by a piece directly inscribed to the English 
poet. Since this piece is one of the best in the 
volume, we must quote from it. 

" May that blessed day come early, 

Tommy A., 

When the British nation learns 
That it's silly to be surly. 
Not a Boy in Blue but yearns, 

Tommy A., 

Tommy A., 

For the good old family fashion, 
Arm in arm, for all in age ; 
And if others want a thrashin', 
Why we 'd never say 'em nay ; 
With our helmets on our head, 
An' our tunics, blue or red, 
An' our jolly bugles playin' 
All the way from New York bay to Bombay ! 

So 
Go it ! you are game. 

Tommy A., 

Tommy A., 
For our pride is in your fame, 

Tommy A. 

Half a million Boys in Blue 
Drink a health, my lad, to you, 
An' they '11 cheer you from Bombay to Mandelay, 

Tommy A. 

Half a million Boys in Bine 
Stand to back you through and through, 
An' perhaps they '11 prove it too, 
If there ever comes a day 

When a brother needs a brother for to help him on his way, 
Anywhere betwixt Berlin an' Mandelay, 

Tommy A." 

Other pieces are more suggestive of Mr. Bret Harte 
(from whom Mr. Kipling himself really derives), 
and the famous ballad of the " Heathen Chinee " is 
provided with a not unworthy counterpart in the tale 
of " A Man from Noo York," who was about as 
guileless as Ah Sin. 
" Sa-ay, 

He said that he did n't know poker, 
An' he swore that he did n't drink rum ; 
Which, stranger, I '11 state I'm no soaker, 
Leastways, I 'in no all-around-bum. 
An' he said that he did n't like ladies, 
Yet I seen him smile twice at my Anne ; 
He was young so he said and afraid his 
Simplicity shocked me ! Oh, damn 1 
An' he feared some nefarious man 
Might play him a game of flim-flam, 
If be pushed the door, 
An' walked on the floor, 
Where the wicked men rush the can." 

The rest of this moving tale may easily be imagined. 
We should like to quote from u The Texas Rangers," 
which is in the same vein, but space forbids. " The 
Visit to West Point " gives a barrack-room view of 
the meddlesome legislator much like the inside views 
of Parliamentary commissions which Mr. Kipling 
has given us with such telling effect. A second sec- 
tion of this volume is more serious, and has touches 
of an art not unlike Mr. Dobson's. Its prevailing 
note, however, is less restrained, being well illus- 
trated by the stanzas entitled "The Worm Turns."

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



"While I 'ra tugging my mustache, 
Leaning on the window-sash, 
In the garden, you, below, 
Decked in ribbon, lace, and bow, 
Promenade, six men in tow. 

" Men who hang upon your lips, 
Bend above your finger-tips ; 
Each his humble tribute pays, 
Litts to you his ardent gaze, 
Turning your small head with praise. 

" You are pleased to treat with scorn 
Men, as though beneath you born. 
You believe it when we say : 

' Man is born but to obey ! 
You are made of finer clay.' 

" ' Man is built from common dirt, 
Scarcely fit to touch your skirt ! 
Woman is his better half, 
Better angel ! queen ! his staff ! ' 
Pray excuse me while I laugh. 

"If we call you 'angel,' 'queen,' 
Take it simply that we mean 
WE are KINGS ! Oh, do n't yon know, 
You 're not really angels though, 
Till Saint Peter tells you so? " 

"At the Gates of Song," by Mr. Lloyd Mifflin, 
is a collection of one hundred and fifty sonnets, 
selected, so the author tells us, from about twice 
that number. Mr. Mifflin is evidently a facile ver- 
sifier, for the present volume is accompanied by a 
notice of three other books of poems " now in course 
of publication." Although these sonnets bear a 
modest title, it is evident that their author takes 
himself very seriously. He presents the public with 
his portrait as well as his poems, and, after remark- 
ing upon the difficulties of the sonnet-form, adds 
that " he is proud in the consciousness that if he has 
added nothing to the lustre of that narrow and 
intricate domain of literature, at least he has not 
tarnished it with anything indecorous and unseemly." 
Both of the foregoing claims may well enough be 
allowed, for the sonnets (except for an occasional 
liberty taken of set purpose with the structure) are 
conspicuously correct in form, well-balanced, smooth- 
sounding, and each the expression of a definite 
thought. But with all this technical correctness, 
they are somehow lacking in the power to thrill or 
even deeply to stir the reader. A good typical ex- 
ample is " Build Thou Thy Temples." 
" Reward lies in the work, not in the eye 

Nor voice of critic. Whether in the mart, 
Or on the Heliconian hills apart. 
Toil at thy temples builded in the sky. 
Dreams are, in sooth, the only verity. 
The world with scorn may lacerate thy heart 
Insult with praise too late. . . . Delve at thine Art : 
Beauty shall never unremembered die. 
"The sculptor, unillustrious and alone, 
Pent in the still seclusion of his room, 
Carves, through the vexed vicissitude of years, 
Some marvel in Carrara, but the stone 

Men heed not till it stand above his tomb 
The cold commemoration of his tears." 

One may find no fault with such work as this. It 
is truly noble in sentiment, and excellently put. 
Only and this is the feeling with which we have 
read Mr. Mifllin's work throughout it lacks the 



imaginative vision ; its ideas have long been stereo- 
typed ; and its phrasing rarely escapes from the 
conventional mould. 

Mr. Henry Hanby Hay, whose " Created Gold," 
published some time ago, we were able to greet with 
a qualified kind of praise, now approaches the 
public with a new volume, " Trumpets and Shawms." 
Trumpets we know, but we are a little uncertain 
about shawms. The author calls them " dulcet," 
and compares them with gentle bells and tinkling 
rills. We have not found much that is dulcet in 
the volume, but the blaring quality is very evident. 
Mr. Hay is a Manxman, it seems, and has persuaded 
that other Manxman, Mr. Hall Caine, to write an 
introduction for the volume. We are told that the 
poet " has given us the very color and scent of our 
lovely and beloved little island." A judgment 
passed by so competent an authority must be allowed, 
although the Manx influence is less noticeable than 
the influence of the man Robert Browning, who has 
evidently been Mr. Hay's model. Sometimes he 
succeeds in giving us a very fair imitation of the 
sort of dramatic idyl or monologue that Browning 
produced so readily. "The Court Awards It," 
being Shylock's soliloquy the day after the trial, is 
a case in point. 

"Oh, dog! the opportunity was thine 
To face the crowd, which, though it hated, feared ; 
And take the guilty flesh with even hand, 
And show their justice what their justice is ! 
Wail not for that, but rather tell thyself 
The cavilling court had birthed one cavil more, 
A hundred hands had plucked away thy steel ; 
Thou might'st not. Never Jew found Christian just. 
Oh, had I dared to dash the court aside. 
Under the fifth rib strike, and end it all ! 
And do as they do, say the man was cursed, 
And then proceed to execute the curse." 

Mr. Hay's qualities, and their defects, may be well 
illustrated by the closing lines of " A Vestal." The 
climax of the gladiatorial combat has been reached, 
and, 

" Dread stillness the horror entrances, 
All pause for the signal of death, 
While a Vestal, with dead, pallid glances 

Looks down and indraws her calm breath : 
Death broods o'er the ebony ocean, 

Men gazing and fearing, but dumb ; 
Till the Vestal, sans warmth or emotion, 

Points down to the earth with her thumb. 
All are gone (and the carcass is somewhere), 

The Csesar to revel and shame, 
While the Virgin, slow pallid and dumb fair, 
Preserves the perpetual flame." 

Mr. Lessor's " Echoes of Halcyon Days," we 
learn, date from ten or more years ago, when the 
author, too, dwelt in Arcadia. Their belated pub- 
lication is influenced " partly by the promptings of 
perhaps over-zealous friends, partly by the author's 
parental desire to congregate the mental offspring 
of a period antedating his embarkation on the 
' bubble, toil, and trouble ' of a professional career." 
That career, he takes pains to inform us, has borne 
" literary fruit in the form of a treatise on ' The 
Historical Development of the Jury System.' " We

do not know that treatise, but we trust that it is 
lucid and worthy of its high theme. The " Echoes," 
however, have been wafted to our ears, and the 
author's confession of " long addiction to the philos- 
ophy of stoicism " emboldens us to say that they 
are not remarkable. We quote from the touching 
and tragic tale of " Lucian and Lydia." 

" As his blood was ebbing fast and faster, 

Lucian oped his glazing: eyes once more, 
Turned a mute curse on the cruel master 

Angels to the seat of judgment bore : 
Then one long look on his loving maiden 

Of eternal hope that one look said : 
And his soul, of earthly woes unladen, 

From his mangled body upward fled." 

If any more " echoes of halcyon days " yet linger 
in Mr. Lessor's memory, we trust that he will sup- 
press them. The law is an excellent profession, 
and, without knowing anything of Mr. Lessor's 
professional career, we have no hesitation in saying 
that his chances of shining as a legal luminary are 
considerably greater than his chances of success in 
wooing the fickle muse. 

We get back into the domain of true poetry when 
we turn to the exquisite volume which bears the 
honored name of Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford. 
Here is imagination and to spare; here also are 
chastened thought and melodious utterance. We 
should like to quote at length from the varied con- 
tents of this collection, but must remain content 
with a single sonnet. 

" When in the dark of some despairing dream 
Sorrow has all her will with me, and ease 
Is full forgotten, through her dear degrees 
Steals Music, beckoning with a hand supreme 
For me to follow. Straight I see the gleam 
Where the winds dip them in the far bright seas 
That roll and break about the Hebrides, 
See white wings flash and hear the sea-birds scream. 

" Or it may be in palace gardens falls 

The moonlight on white roses, where the swell 
Of one great lover's heart in passion calls 

To deeps in other hearts. And, listening, well 
I know, while sink my slow dissolving walls, 
So Music lured Eurydice from hell." 

This poem is peculiarly typical of Mrs. Spofford's 
work, because it is one of several that show her to 
be no stranger to the message that music bears to 
the soul. Her apprehension of the divinest of the 
arts is something deeper than the merely conven- 
tional appreciation of most poets. They use musical 
terminology as a rhetorical adornment merely ; the 
present writer seeks to give it a real verbal inter- 
pretation. 

Miss Ruth Lawrence's sheaf of " Colonial 
Verses " consists of short poems written to accom- 
pany a series of photographs taken at Mount Ver- 
non. The verses are correct and pretty, embodying 
a graceful sentiment, but in no way remarkable. 
" Beneath the Trees " is a good example. 

" Beneath the trees at even-glow 
I wander, meditative, slow, 
Where courtiers brave with gold and lace 
Befitting well the stately place, 
Once gayly sauntered to and fro. 



" On velvet turf by green hedge-row 
I picture statesman, scholar, beau, 
And dainty damsel fair of face, 
Beneath the trees. 

' ' The rays upon the dial show 
How swift the deepening shadows grow. 
The noble fathers of our race 
Are gone, with all their wit and grace, 
They laid their ashes long ago 
Beneath the trees." 

In Mr. John Stuart Thomson, we must welcome 
a worthy accession to the growing choir of Cana- 
dian singers. His " Estabelle and Other Verse " is 
a noteworthy production, and gives him an un- 
doubted right to a place in the group of poets headed 
by Professor Roberts, Mr. Lampmann, and Mr. 
W. W. Campbell. Our extract may be no more than 
a single stanza the closing one from the long 
and beautiful *' Ode Written in Autumn." 
" Strange suns begin to light the shorter days ; 
The Indian summer and the harvest moon 
Give way before the banks of purple haze ; 

Cicadas pipe at eve their shrilly tune, 
Bucolics of the melancholy time ; 

The mower now surveys the low-laid grain, 
And picks a last belated berry red ; 

The corn-ricks' shadows lengthen on the plain ; 
Soft on the breeze I hear a distant chime 
Tolling a requiem for th' untimely dead." 

It is remarkable how close to the heart of nature 
these young Canadian poets contrive to keep. 
They have the faculty of observation minute, 
accurate, and at the same time sympathetic in a 
degree quite extraordinary even to-day, and almost 
unknown in English poetry before Tennyson opened 
our eyes. Mr. Thomson's poems are nearly all lyrics 
of nature, and many of them strike a note of pure 
and singular beauty. 

By way of interlude between the American and 
the English section of this survey, we may at this 
point say a word about a modest booklet of French 
verse, written by M. Rene* de Poyen-Bellisle, of the 
University of Chicago, and entitled "Journe'es 
d' Avril. ' Je n ,^ cris plua de vergi > 
says the author, 

" Ce sont mes peche's de jeunesse, 
Que pour rechauffer mes hivers 
En vieux grandpere je caresse." 

We take the liberty of doubting the exact truth of 
this observation, and hope to read many more 
verses by M. de Poyen-Bellisle before he reaches 
grandfatherly years. There are some charming 
things in the present collection, cameos in the man- 
ner of Gautier, musings in the manner of Musset, 
and sonnets of skilful construction. One of the 
shorter pieces is this " Enigme." 

" II avait dpuise" tout le possible humain ; 

Les Empires s'e'taient e'branle's sons sa main, 

L' Art s'dtait enrichi de ses efforts utiles ; 

Gi See a lui les deserts 4taient beaux et fertiles ; 

Mais il restait toujonrs petit et me'content ; 

Et sans pouvoir trouver, cherchait ; sombre, haletant ! 

Puis U n jour il comprit ! et courbant bas la tSte, 

Joyeux il murmura : ' Ta volonte" soit faite ' ! " 

One of the best things to be found in this volume is 



188 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



the really remarkable translation of Shakespeare's 
" When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes." 
The closing verses are as follows : 

"Soudain je pense a toi ; tout rit dans ma pensee 
Et coimne 1'alouette au ciel bleu s'^langant 
Chante un hyrune d'amour avec le jour naissant ; 
J'ai bientot oublie ma misere passe*e, 
C'est que, je t'ainie tant, que quand je pense a toi 
Je ne changerai pas mon sort avec un roi ! " 

Of all the verse evoked by the jubilee of Queen 
Victoria, Mr. Kipling's '' Recessional " has made the 
deepest impression, and best deserves to be long 
remembered. Probably next in importance to that 
noble poem is the " Jubilee Greeting at Spithead to 
the Men of Greater Britain," written by Mr. Theo- 
dore Watts-Dunton. This work, albeit only a thin 
pamphlet, is also noteworthy as being the first pub- 
lication of its author in anything that may be called 
book form. The foremost of living English critics, 
and one of the most notable of living English poets, 
Mr. Watts-Dunton has thus far been content with 
the suffrages of the few who have found him out, 
who have learned to detect his personality in un- 
signed pages of "The Athenaeum," or who have 
treasured up in scrap-book his furtively-appearing 
sonnets. A volume of his " Poems " has now been 
promised us for more than two years past, but we 
shall not believe in it until it actually lies upon our 
table. The " Jubilee Greeting " now published is a 
poem in twenty-two stanzas, one of which we have 
selected, not without difficulty, as representative of 
the whole. 

" They fought with England long ago ; 
They strove with her whose gate the billows keep ; 

On Channel chalk they sleep below 
In caverns of the great North Sea they sleep. 

' Thus soldier, priest, and mariner,' 
He said, our guardian angel said, 'shall perish ; 
My deeps have still a sepulchre 
For all whom envy or hate shall stir 
To strike across them strike at England, her 
The billows cherish.' " 

The grave austere note of the above excerpt char- 
acterizes this fine poem throughout. The work is 
fittingly dedicated " to our great contemporary 
writer of patriotic poetry, Algernon Charles Swin- 
burne." 

Mr. Francis Thompson's volume of " New Poems " 
is, like its two predecessors, a very Klondike for 
the gold-hunters of song, and its treasures are almost 
as difficult of access. The public is fairly well 
informed by this time of Mr. Thompson's distressing 
mannerisms, verbal perversities, and wanton obscu- 
rities of thought. It knows also that whoever is 
prepared to brave hardships in the quest of beauty 
may often find it, imbedded nugget-like in the rough 
matrix of Mr. Thompson's verse. Here, for exam- 
ple, is treasure-trove such as shall reward the dili- 
gent seeker. 

" Happiness is the shadow of things past, 
Which fools still take for that which is to be I 
And not all foolishly : 
For all the past, read true, is prophecy, 
And all the firsts are hauntings of some Last, 



And all the springs are flash-lights of one Spring. 

Then leaf, and flower, and falless fruit 

Shall hang together on the unyellowing bough ; 

And silence shall be Music mute 

For her surcharged heart." 

But to reach this passage he must make his way 
through a " discinct nature," and over " coerule 
pampas of the heavens," where " reel the swift 
spheres intemperably," besides witnessing many 
other strange sights and sounds. 

Mr. Watson's " The Year of Shame " has been 
on our shelves so long that it has lost something of 
its timeliness. It consists mainly of sonnets on the 
Armenian question, including those previously pub- 
lished in " The Purple East." The Bishop of Here- 
ford contributes an introduction, in which he assures 
us that " it is the spirit of Isaiah that is represented 
in this book of poems." This is flattering to Mr. 
Watson, if not to the prophet. But the poet has suf- 
fered before this from the praises of his injudicious 
admirers. There is real fire in his work, although 
it blazes up with too furious a rhetoric to produce 
the deepest impression. For example, he calls the 
Sultan " Abdul the Damned." Most poets would 
have let it go at that, but Mr. Watson's wrath is 
unsatisfied, and he continues : 

" In a world where cruel deeds abound, 
The merely damned are legion : with such souls 
Is not each hollow and cranny of Tophet crammed ? 
Thou with the brightest of hell's aureoles 
Dost shine supreme, incomparably crowned, 
Immortally, beyond all mortals, damned." 

This is the mere impotence of wrath. Compare 
these " Dirffl " with those of Mr. Swinburne, for 
example, and one gets the difference between froth 
and freshet, between fire and flame. " So soon is 
dead indifference come?" asks Mr. Watson. Yes, 
and with indifference to the theme of his out- 
pourings a greatly abated interest in the sonnets 
themselves. Vehemence is one thing, and deep- 
seated indignation another. Mr. Watson may have 
had the latter, but he has put only the former into 
his verse. He has written neither Swinburnian 
" Dirse " nor " Chatiments " after the manner of 
Hugo, but merely a set of turgid and overwrought 
sonnets. We should not speak so severely were 
Mr. Watson a poet of less pretensions, but he has 
been so clamorously belauded that it becomes the 
evident duty of criticism to speak the exact truth 
about his work. He must be measured by higher 
standards than those usually set for minor poets, 
since comparison with the greatest has been chal- 
lenged, if not by him, at least for him by his friends 
and admirers. 

" A Shropshire Lad," by Mr. A. E. Housman, is 
a collection of short poems, extremely simple in 
diction, which strike a thin but pure lyric note. 
Here is one of them : 

" From far, from eve and morning 

And yon twelve-winded sky, 
The stuif of life to knit me 
Blew hither : here am I. 



1897.]

" Now for a breath I tarry 

Nor yet disperse apart. 
Take my hand quick and tell me, 

What have you in your heart. 
"Speak now, and I will answer ; 

How shall I help you, say ; 
Ere to the wind's twelve quarters 
I take my endless way." 

Almost equally simple, but now more animated, 
now informed with a deeper passion, are the poems 
contained in Mr. A. C. Benson's new volume. Here 
the author shall be his own critic, and a part of his 
" Envoi " at once illustrate and describe his verse. 
" I cannot sing: as sings the nightingale 

Frenzied with rapture, big with rich delight, 
Till lovers lean together, passion-pale, 

And chide the awestruck silence of the night. 
"I cannot sing as sings the brooding dove, 

At windless noon, in her high towers of green, 
A song of deep content, untroubled love, 

With many a meditative pause between. 
" But I can sing as sings the prudent bee, 

As hour by patient hour he goes and comes, 
Bearing the golden dust from tree to tree, 
Labours in hope, and as he labours, hums." 

Mr. Benson's poetry is very genuine, and impresses 
the reader with its sincerity and artistic restraint. 

Mr. Hilaire Belloc's " Verses and Sonnets " are 
by turns quaint, musical, and passionate. The son- 
nets exhibit his best work, although some of them 
take great liberties with the form. We quote the 
sestet from " The Poor of London," an invocation 
to the justice of God. 

" The Poor of Jesus Christ whom no man hears 

Have called upon your vengeance much too long. 

Wipe out not tears but blood our eyes bleed tears : 
Come, smite our damned sophistries so strong, 

That thy rude hammer battering this rude wrong 
Ring down the abyss of twice ten thousand years." 

Mr. J. S. Fletcher's " Ballads of Revolt " are six 
in number, and make up a very small book indeed. 
They mark with deep irony the contrast between 
what life really is and what the idealist would have 
it to be, between the mechanical observance of 
religion and its innermost spirit. Perhaps the 
most impressive of the ballads is " The Scapegoat," 
which has for its theme the life of Christ. 
" Then woke the world with sudden stir, 
(Whence came this power our hearts to draw ? 
Call ye this man a carpenter ? 
He is a God ! ) they cried in awe. 
" Ah me, it was no god they hailed, 
No arbiter of life and death, 
But a poor man who dared and failed, 
A carpenter of Nazareth. 
" Failed ? Aye, for still the nations bend 
To their false gods a servile knee, 
And still the scapegoat finds his end 
On the dark heights of Calvary. 
" But here and there upon the sun 
Some man still fixes dauntless eyes, 
And says ' Amen ! It is begun ; 
Let the new life in me arise ! ' " 

The similarity of this work to that of Mr. John 
Davidson is obvious, and it may be said that Mr. 
Fletcher does not suffer in the comparison.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

An Englishman's We nave *>& Mr. G. W. Steevens's 
instructive studies little book entitled " The Land of 
the Dollar" (Dodd) with pleasure 
and, we trust, some profit. The author is a wide- 
awake, open-minded Englishman who visited our 
shores during the progress of the recent president- 
ial campaign, and his book is a reprint of letters 
written by him while on the wing through the 
States, to the London " Daily Mail." The mental 
attitude of the average English traveller to America 
is one of amused curiosity. He comes to America 
predisposed first of all to laugh ; and he usually 
laughs his fill at least so long as he remains on 
this side of the line that divides us from Canada. 
Mr. Steevens brought to our shores an abundant 
stock of curiosity, and a sense of humor by no means 
deficient. But as a traveller he is not primarily 
the man who laughs. His liking for " Max 'Rell " 
is evident ; but he can hardly be said to have taken 
the Frenchman as his model. He came to this 
country chiefly to study us at close range during 
the bustle of an exciting political campaign. To 
this end he attended conventions, large and small, 
local and general; he watched miles upon miles of 
political parades, and endured hours upon hours of 
political oratory ; he heard both candidates speak ; 
he saw the arrival at Canton of one of those aston- 
ishing "delegations" this time one from Portage 
County, " the finest county in the country," as Mr. 
McKinley took care to point out with great force in 
his address; he witnessed the placarding of the 
returns, and the subsequent frenzied jubilation of 
the victors. Mr. Steevens describes all this with 
some humor, but with an ever-present sense of the 
real gravity and dignity of the main situation. He 
endeavors to outline clearly for the benefit of his 
English readers the trend of the looming political, 
social, and economical issues which must from now 
on, even at the best of times, haunt the consciousness 
of the people of this country, and which it only needs 
a period of "hard times " like the one now waning 
to bring to light with startling distinctness. " Good 
times " are now setting in ; and we shall probably 
go on in the old way for another decade or so mak- 
ing hay prosperously while the sun shines and 
taking little or no thought for the morrow. But 
"hard times" will recur; discontent will recur; the 
cry for change will recur. There will again be 
(who can doubt it?) the ominous confrontation at 
the polls of candidates representing respectively 
the class whose interest it is to conserve, and the 
class whose only seeming chance of salvation it is 
to pull down. The crisis may again be tided over ; 
but, speaking in the light of current indications, 
one may fairly say that he would be an optimistic 
prophet indeed who should predict that it will be 
averted or its asperities softened by the wise antic- 
ipatory reforms and concessions of those now in a 
position to make them. Mr. Steevens is no such 
prophet, nor indeed does he venture much into

direct vaticination. His view of our national future 
is not on the whole a sombre one that is, of our 
ultimate luture. If there are storms ahead for us, 
they will at least purify the air. Growing class an- 
tagonisms, and a widespread conviction that to get 
dollars is the one end of life these, Mr. Steevens 
concludes, are the twin sources of our national peril. 
The lighter topics usually touched upon by the 
tourist are not neglected in the volume, which is, 
all in all, much the best of its kind that has come 
to our notice of late. 



Sophia V. Bompiani's brief " His- 
The Waldentet. tory of the Waldenses " (A.. S. 

Barnes & Co.) is an excellent essay 
upon the characteristics, chief personages, and 
events in the history of that most ancient body of 
religious reformers whose descendants to-day oc- 
cupy a small part, not more than three hundred 
square miles, of the Cottian Alps. Historians have 
usually ascribed the organization and faith of the 
Waldenses to Peter Waldo, a distinguished preach- 
er of the twelfth century, but the author accepts 
rather the traditions of the people themselves, 
quoting many authorities in support of a much 
earlier origin. It is shown that when the Paul- 
icians of Armenia, fleeing from the persecutions 
of the eastern emperors, emigrated to France in 
the eighth century, and there established the sect 
known as the Albigenses, they found in the Wal- 
denses, just across the Italian border, a people of 
similar religious beliefs. The traditions of the 
Waldenses assert that they were driven from 
southern Italy, in the time of the second and 
third centuries, to the Alpine valleys, where they 
have since lived. About one-third of the book is 
devoted to this contention for the antiquity of the 
people, while the remainder, written with unfailing 
interest, treats of their innumerable persecutions 
by the Papacy, their ministers, their heroes, their 
martyrs, and their final attainment of religious 
freedom in 1848. 

In '* The Novels of Charles Dickens," 
recently issued in the " Book- Lover's 
Library " (Armstrong), Mr. Fred- 
eric G. Kitton has collected a fund of interesting 
and valuable information concerning the works of 
a writer whose wonderful popularity seems ever on 
the increase. The growth and development of each 
of the great novels, the circumstances under which 
it was produced, the terms of publication, facts re- 
lating to the illustrators and to famous prototypes 
of characters in the novels, present whereabouts 
of the original MSS., present value of fii>t editions, 
all this and much more is here set forth in a f re-h 
and entertaining way. The work is interesting alike 
to the book-collector and to the lover of Dickens--, 
and forms a welcome addition to Mr. Kitton's nu- 
merous volumes of Diekensiana. " My Father as I 
Recall Him," by Miss Mamie Dickens (Westmin- 
ster, England : The Roxburghe Press), is a simple 



and unpretentious account of the home life of the 
great novelist, written by his youngest daughter. 
No attempt is made at an elaborate or connected 
biography, and little that is not already known may 
be found in the volume. But these few slight 
sketches give us such a charming and intimate pic- 
ture of Dickens the man that the lover of his works 
who does not read the little book will have missed 
a distinct pleasure. 



A manual of 
our common 

wild flowers. 



To those who wish to become ac- 
quainted with our common flowers 
by an easier method than that pre- 
sented in the ordinary text-books of botany, the vol- 
ume by Mrs. Caroline A. Creevy, entitled " Flowers 
of Field, Hill, and Swamp" (Harpers), may be cor- 
dially commended. The author is an adept in the 
science she illustrates, and while devising a simple 
way by which lovers of wild flowers may learn their 
names and relationships, she has not neglected to 
dignify her work with an array of curious and well- 
digested information. The plants are classed in 
groups according to their habitat in low meadows, 
dry fields, cool woods, or in and near the water. 
About a thousand species belonging to the Atlantic 
States from New England to Florida, and for the 
most part to the Middle States also, are described. 
The volume is a pleasant supplement to the man- 
uals of Grey, Bessey, and others of their rank. 

Roadside .ketches Mr ; F - Schuyler Mathews's Fa- 
withpen miliar Features of the Roadside " 

andpenai. (Appleton) is a volume made doubly 

attractive by its wealth of illustrations, the work of 
the author's clever hand. The chapters describe 
the varied wild life to be met with in tramps along 
a country road, including flowers, birds, insects, and 
amphibious. The author appears to be interested 
in the different tribes alike, and to be equally appre- 
ciative of their respective traits. In treating the 
birds, he makes an attempt to reduce their songs 
within the limits of our musical scale. Such at- 
tempts are interesting, but as a rule not entirely 
satisfactory. As each bird has some peculiar fashion 
in the delivery of his song, so each listener seems 
to have a peculiar experience in hearing it. For 
example, on page 119 Mr. Mathews states that the 
phoabe's strain comprises only two notes, and he 
writes them with a falling inflection. Every phoabe 
which we have ever heard lisped his several notes 
with both rising and falling inflection, and his song 
is so described by most authorities. 



Tfie Dungeons 
of Old Paris. 



Mr. Tighe Hopkins has given us, in 
a presentably made volume of 265 
pages, a rather interesting account, 
interspersed with more or less familiar historical 
episodes in point, of "The Dungeons of Old 
Paris " (Putnam). His endeavor has been to restore 
to such storied edifices as the Prison d'Etat, the 
Conciergerie, the Maison de Justice, etc., their 
special and distinctive character at the most import-

ant dates in their respective careers, and thus to 
bring home to the reader the full force and signifi- 
cance of the old French proverb, " Triste comme 
les portes d 'une prison" The author seems to be 
somewhat of an enthusiast on his dismal subject 
an amateur of historic prisons, as it were; and he 
goes into the harrowing details of the architecture 
of his favorite edifices with evident zest and no 
little learning. " I have undone," he assures us, 
" the bolts of nearly all the more celebrated pris- 
ons of historic Paris, few of which are standing at 
this day." Vincennes, the Temple, the Concier- 
gerie, the Abbaye, Sainte-Pelagie, the Bastille 
these are certainly names around which cluster 
memories of dramatic scenes and striking figures. 
Of the narrative and romantic possibilities of his 
theme Mr. Hopkins makes fair use. The book is 
liberally sprinkled with illustrations, some of them 
after curious old plates. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The seventh edition of Mr. George Haven Putnam 's 
"Authors and Publishers" presents a revised text and 
considerable additional material. For those not already 
familiar with this useful book, we quote from the title- 
page a description of the contents of this " manual of 
suggestions for beginners in literature." The work 
comprises, in brief, "a description of publishing meth- 
ods and arrangements, directions for the prepara- 
tion of MSS. for the press, explanations of the details 
of book-manufacturing, instructions for proof-reading, 
specimens of typography, the text of the United States 
copyright law, and information concerning interna- 
tional copyrights, together with general bints for au- 
thors." This handsomely printed volume is published 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sous. 

Among the many attractive editions of standard 
English literature published this season by Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co., we note with particular approval 
the reprints of Matthew Arnold s poems and Brown- 
ing 's " The Ring and the Book." The Arnold volume 
includes a number of early poems hitherto uncollected, 
and has an introduction by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole. 
But why, oh why, does Mr. Dole say that Arnold con- 
demned the American people as a race that knew not 
Obermann, " as a knowledge of Obermann was in his 
eyes a test of civilization " ? The special features of the 
Browning volume are the biography, introduction, and 
explanatory notes contributed by the editors, Miss Char- 
lotte Porter and Miss Hi-len A. Clarke, whose zeal for 
their chosen poet is well known to readers of " Poet- 
Lore," and whose fitness for the present task no one 
may question. 

"The Works of Francois Rabelais," in the famous 
old translation of Urqtihart and Motteux, are republished 
in a tasteful five-volume edition by Messrs. Gibbings 
& Co. of London. The J. B. Lippincott Co. are the 
American agents for this work. Mr. Alfred Wallis 
has revised the text and provided an introduction, and 
the volumes are charmingly illustrated by photogravure 
reproductions of the plates in Picart's Amsterdam 
edition of 1741. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Gautier's ever-delightful " Captain Fracasse," trans- 
lated by Miss Ellen Murray Beam, is published in an 
attractive illustrated edition by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. 

Mr. Henri Pene du Bois has made a translation of 
Prosper MerimeVs " Letters to an Unknown," and the 
work is published by the Messrs. Brentano in very 
tasteful and pleasing form. 

The 1897 volume of " The Pageant," a literary and 
art annual, will be published shortly by Mr. M. F. Mans- 
field of New York, and will contain contributions from 
many of the best-known writers and artists of the day. 

A translation of Diderot's immortal " Rameau's 
Nephew," made by Miss Sylvia Margaret Hill, is pub- 
lished by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The trans- 
lation is from the autographic text of the author, undis- 
covered until 1890. 

A new edition of the Waverley novels, in forty-eight 
volumes, and similar in form and make-up to the popu- 
lar " Temple Classics," will be published in this country 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons, in connection with 
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. of London. 

"Clever Tales," selected and edited by Miss Char- 
lotte Porter and Miss Helen A. Clarke, is a volume of 
translations from Villiers de 1'Isle Adam, Strindberg, 
Hale*vy, Garshin, Kielland, and Arbes, most if not all of 
the tales having previously appeared in " Poet-Lore." 
Messrs. Copeland & Day are the publishers. 

" A Manual of Physical Drill," by Lieut. Edmund L. 
Butts, is published by Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. The 
object of the work is to systematize physical training in 
the army, and to furnish a practical guide that will en- 
able any officer to give regular and beneficial instruction 
to his command. The volume is well illustrated with 
reproductions of photographs. 

The Doubleday & McClure Co., a new publishing firm, 
have sent us some interesting announcements which 
reached us too late for inclusion in the " List of Fall 
Announcements " in our last issue. Among the title* 
on their list may be mentioned Mark Twain's new book, 
" Following the Equator"; "The Open Boat, and Other 
Tales of Adventure," by Mr. Stephen Crane ; an eighteen- 
volume edition of Shakespeare, edited by Prof. Henry 
Morley; "Tales from McClure's," in three volumes; 
"Bird Neighbors," with fifty colored illustrations; a 
volume by Colonel Waring, of the New York street- 
cleaning department; and a half-dozen other equally 
interesting books. 

Mr. Richard Holt Button, who died on the 10th of 
September, was best known to the world as the editor 
of the "Spectator." His personality was so merged 
in that review that he found little opportunity for out- 
side literary work, and the list of his books is a brief 
one, including only the " Scott " in the " English Men 
of Letters" and a few volumes of miscellaneous essays 
in criticism. He was a strong and serious writer (if 
anything over-serious), and the chief bent of his mind 
was in the direction of religious and philosophical prob- 
lems. His temper was conservative, the concession* 
to liberalism that he could not help making in this age 
of the world were made grudgingly, and he did not 
always display the candor that we had the right to ex- 
pect of a writer occupying his position. His best crit- 
ical writing is probably to be found in his essays on. 
Arnold and Newman.

ST. IVES. 

The Adventures of a French Prisoner in England. 

By ROBERT Louis STEVENSON. 12mo, $1.50. 

St. Ives is a story of action and adventure in the author's most 
buoyant and stirring manner. One does not expect to find common- 
places in Stevenson, but even his most ardent admirers may well be 
surprised at the grim tragedy in the opening chapters of St. Ives. 
The delicate task of completing the few unfinished chapters from Mr. 
Stevenson's notes has been entrusted to Mr. Quiller-Couch, whose 
work begins with Chapter XXXI. 

SELECTED POEMS. 

By GEORGE MEREDITH. Arranged by the author and 

including all his most popular works. With portrait.

THOMAS AND MATTHEW ARNOLD, 

And their Influence on English Education. (The 

Great Educators.) By SIR JOSHUA G. FITCH, LL.D., 
late Inspector of Training Colleges in England, and 
Lecturer on Education at the University of Cambridge. 
12mo, $1.00 net. 

The great service rendered by the Master of Rugby to the youth 
of several generations in inspiring a love of study, and the faithful 
work of his even more distinguished son in broadening the character 
of primary and secondary education, are here pointed out with pre- 
cision, while the discussion of Matthew Arnold's less special literary 
work appeals to a wider than the educational public. 

THE HISTORY OF THE LADY BETTY 
STAIR. 

By MOLLY ELLIOT SEA WELL. Illustrated by Thule de 
Thulstrup. In an original binding similar to "The 
Sprightly Romance of Marsac." 12mo, $1.25. 
Miss Seawell's " Sprightly Romance of Marsac " will be remem- 
bered by all as one of the deftest and most entertaining stories of the 
past year. The author's lightness of touch is just as apparent in the 
present tale, a bit of pure romance whose scene shifts from Versailles 
to Edinburgh and Algiers.

AMERICAN NOBILITY. 

A Novel. By PIERRE DE COULEVAIN. 12mo, $1.50. 

The burning question of " international " marriages has never 
been so ably handled in fiction as in the present story. The novel 
opens with the courtship of a rich American girl by an impecunious 
French marquis, and the succeeding developments, with the striking 
pictures of French life in the Faubourg St. Germain, at the chateau 
en province, and at the seaside, are of intense interest. 

THE BIBLE AND ISLAM; 

Or, The Influence of the Old and New Testaments 
on the Religion of Mohammed. (Being the Ely lect- 
ures for 1897.) By HENRY PRESERVED SMITH, D.D. 
12mo, $1.50. 
A special timeliness attaches to this book, the purpose of which 

is to explain the tenacity of Islam and the wonderful hold it has upon 

its disciples. 



THIS COUNTRY OF OURS. 

By BENJAMIN HARRISON, Ex-President of the United 

States. 12mo, $1.50. 

This is essentially a unique volume. In it General Harrison has 
described, so simply and directly that the most uninformed person 
cannot fail of enlightenment, the way in which this vast country of 
ours is governed. The various departments of our National Govern- 
ment, with their functions and their individual peculiarities, are thus 
characterized and described by an author who has himself occupied 
the chief place and the most responsible position in this tremendous 
and complex machinery ; and the result is a book which for the first 
time presents an adequate view of a subject that is of prime interest 
to every American. 

CATHERINE SCHUYLER. 

By MARY GAY HUMPHREYS. ( Women of Colonial and 
Revolutionary Times.) With photogravure portrait, 
12mo, $1.25. 

Miss Humphreys's volume on the wife of Major-General Philip 
Bchuyler completes this interesting series of volumes. Mrs. Schuy- 
ler's biography carries with it life in Albany, in the old Hudson 
River manor houses and in New York City a hundred years or more ago. 

THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN. 

By Hon. JACOB D. Cox, ex-Governor of Ohio. With 

maps, 8vo, $2.00. 

General Cox speaks with authoritiveness on matters connected 
with the civil war, and he has now produced a final summing up of 
the much discussed and crucial engagement at Franklin on which 
the March to the Sea depended, and which was the "beginning of 
the end " of the war. 

A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE 
APOSTOLIC AGE. 

By ARTHUR C. McGiFFERT, D.D., Ph.D., Professor of 
Church History, Union Theological Seminary. New 
York. Crown 8vo, $2.50 net. (International Theological 
Library.) \ 

Dr. McGiffert has here traced luminously the tendencies and 
development of the Church during this most important period. His 
view is comprehensive and broad and he throws light upon many 
mooted questions in the early history of Christianity. 

for previous and forthcoming volumes, see complete catalogue. 

THE EXPRESS MESSENGER 

And Other Tales of the Rail. By CY WARMAN. 

12mo, $1.25. 

Mr. Wai-man's new book contains a group of stories relating to 
the great social and industrial community that centres about the 
modern railway. Himself an engineer for many years and in many 
lands, the author writes " from the inside," and his tales of character- 
istic incident and adventure are told with the utmost zest and raciness.

ENGLISH LANDS, LETTERS, AND KINGS. 

The Later Georges to Queen Victoria. By DONALD 

G. MITCHELL. 12mo, $1.50. 

Mr. Mitchell continues with this volume his survey of the field 
of English literature. It is written with the invincible charm that 
characterizes everything from his pen, and his account of Byron, 
Scott, Landor, Southey, De Quincey, Wilson, Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, 
Hallam, and so on, is as ever comprehensive in general view yet 
achieving its effect by its affectionate interest in characteristic detail.

THE CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY. 

The four great libraries of Chicago have 
gained for this city of late years the reputa- 
tion of being the chief treasure-house of books 
for public use in the United States. The 
statistics of the large collections in the Public 
Library and the University Library, and of 
the magnificent endowments of the Newberry 
and Crerar Libraries, have been published 
abroad, and made many students wish that 
they had access to such vast stores of printed 
material. This has, however, been distinctly 
a case of distance lending enchantment to the 
view ; for those who have actually sought to 
pursue their studies in the Chicago collections 
have had a tale of their own to tell widely at 
variance with the preconceptions of the out- 
sider. They have learned from sad experience 
that the library advantages of Chicago were 
mostly advantages in posse, and that many a 
less famous library centre offered opportuni- 
ties of greater practical value. The Univer- 
sity Library, even by those who could get 
access to it, was found to be a great mass of 
undigested material, the contents of which no 
one seemed to know with any degree of exact- 
ness. The Newberry Library was found to be 
housed in a magnificent building, but in itself 
a meagre and unsymmetrical collection, strong 
in books for show, and in two or three of 
the many departments of knowledge, but so 
crippled by its extravagant expenditure for 
building purposes as to be debarred forever 
from the power to increase its stores at any- 
thing like the rate which its original endow- 
ment would have seemed to warrant. The 
Crerar Library was found to be but a begin- 
ning, of interest only to students of science, 
and inaugurated upon a plan which, although 
wise and full of promise for the future, could 
offer little for the needs of the present investi- 
gator. The Public Library, finally, although 
in possession of the most generally useful col- 
lection of books, was so cramped for space, and 
so ill equipped for the purposes of the student, 
that it was simply impossible to make any seri- 
ous use of its resources. 

A way of escape from this rather cheerless 
condition of affairs has at last been provided 



208 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



by the completion of the Public Library build- 
ing, which is now ready for use, and which was 
formally dedicated to the public a few days ago, 
on the twenty-sixth anniversary of the Great 
Fire. As far as one, at least, of the four libra- 
ries of Chicago is concerned, promise has 
become fulfilment, and the student may enter 
into his long-awaited heritage of opportunity. 
Within the walls of this building there are now 
gathered a quarter of a million volumes, repre- 
senting all the departments of literature ; and 
every conceivable means for the facilitation of 
their use, whether by the casual reader or the 
serious student, has been provided by the lib- 
erality of a City Council which, whatever its 
shortcomings, has nearly always been willing 
to make appropriations commensurate with the 
needs of the institution, and may be trusted 
to provide as adequate support in the future 
as it has provided in the past. Chicago has 
nothing more entirely creditable to show the 
stranger than this Library, and may point to 
it with just pride as an evidence that the 
higher needs of civilization have not been lost 
sight of amid all the jostling material interests 
of the community. 

The Chicago building is one of the three 
costliest structures devoted to library purposes 
in the United States. The two millions of 
dollars expended upon it have brought their 
full architectural and decorative equivalent, 
and if the buildings at Washington and Boston 
have cost more money it may safely be said that 
neither of them represents an expenditure as 
judicious, or applied as closely to the special 
purposes for which a library building should be 
designed. When such a building is to be 
erected, there is always a conflict between two 
theories. One of these theories is held by 
architects ; the other by professional librarians. 
It is unnecessary to say which of these theories 
is right, and which wrong, and it is pleasant to 
state that the right theory has prevailed in the 
plans of the Chicago edifice. In consequence 
of the above fact, this latest of great library 
buildings is not a pile of masonry built for 
external show, nor is it a gallery for the exhi- 
bition of pictured and sculptured masterpieces. 
It is simply a dignified structure, somewhat 
severe in design, provided with decorative 
adornments that please the eye but do not tend 
to attract gaping throngs of visitors who care 
nothing for books and only get in the way of 
the quiet student. The theory that library 
buildings should be planned for library pur- 
poses never had a stouter champion than the 



late Dr. Poole, and it is a happy eventuation 
that has made the Library which he organized 
the best existing exemplification of the ideas 
for which he so insistently contended. 

The history of this Library is familiar to all 
who are Chicagoans, and to many who are not. 
We need not retell at any length how it sprang 
from the ruins of the burned city, how the grace- 
ful act of Thomas Hughes provided a nucleus 
for the collection, how the books were for a 
time stored in a disused water-tank, how an 
emergency law for the establishment of public 
libraries was passed by the Illinois Legisla- 
ture, how the services of the greatest of Amer- 
ican librarians were secured, how the books 
grew in number and have sojourned in three 
sets of temporary quarters before finding their 
permanent home, or how the support of the 
public, at first somewhat grudgingly given to 
the enterprise, has grown steadily more and 
more cordial and generous, until there is at last 
upon all hands abundant evidence that the city 
not of the few, but of the masses is thor- 
oughly in sympathy with the aims of the insti- 
tution, and determined to keep it in the front 
rank of public collections of books. All of 
these things are an old story ; but what is per- 
haps not generally understood outside of Chi- 
cago is the wise policy by which the directors of 
the institution have kept it all the time in close 
touch with all ages and conditions of readers. 
While it has never catered to the tastes of de- 
praved or vicious persons, it has to a consid- 
erable extent supplied the public with what it 
wants rather than what in the minds of superior 
persons it ought to want. This delicate ques- 
tion is necessarily one of degree. The aim of 
a library should be, first, to attract readers, 
because the reading habit is a good thing in 
itself, and, second, to improve the tastes of 
readers, not by forcing culture upon them, but 
by leading them in the direction of culture 
without their being conscious of the guidance. 
The extent to which this aim has been realized 
is best shown by the simple statement that the 
percentage of fiction among the books read is 
only about one-half what it was in the early 
days of the Library. And it must be remem- 
bered that this statement concerns the institu- 
tion which has a larger home circulation than 
any other public library in the world. So 
remarkable a degree of practical usefulness is 
accounted for by the system of delivery stations 
scattered all over the city, which bring the books 
within easy reach of every household. It is by 
such methods and policies that the Chicago

Public Library has won its place in the affec- 
tions of a vast community, and has set an ex- 
ample that the rest of the country may profit- 
ably follow. We may almost say that it has 
followed the example, for the Illinois Library 
Act has furnished a model for similar legisla- 
tion in many other States, and the city which 
chiefly illustrates the direct operation of that 
act has long been one of the principal foci of 
ideas about library management made so in 
large degree by the fact that it was for twenty 
years the home of William Frederick Poole. 



WEEN DOCTORS DISAGREE. 

" Now who shall arbitrate ? 
Ten men love what I hate, 
Shun what I follow, slight what I receive ; 
Ten, who in ears and eyes 
Match me : we all surmise, 
They this thing, and I that : whom shall my 
soul believe?" 

Well may the general student ask this same 
pertinent question when he finds himself, as he cer- 
tainly will if he reads the critics, fairly in confusion 
amid the various opposing dicta on current expres- 
sion in thought and literature. The poet finds an 
answer to his searching inquiry in the suggestion, 
"Let age speak the truth and give us peace at 
last ! " To be sure, it is within the realm of ethics 
and psychology that Rabbi Ben Ezra leads the 
young disciple thus afield; but is it any the less 
true that in the domain of logic and aesthetics the 
same theory should be applied, the same principle 
be dominant? A series of articles appearing in 
a prominent magazine, which, under the general 
title " Revaluations of Literature," open afresh the 
discussion of reputations and estimates commonly 
looked upon as established and unimpeachable, sug- 
gests the necessity of a general verification of our 
positions concerning the classics of a generation 
ago, with the entire propriety of an occasional "re- 
valuation " of the sages and prophets of the imme- 
diate past. Concerning the fallibility of contem- 
porary judgment, all remark is trite ; we long ago 
admitted that age is the only certain test although 
there is a natural impatience of the event. Very 
good, meanwhile let those who assume authority 
speak: amid the various voices the tones of truth 
will eventually be recognized ; criticism is progres- 
sive, and literary discussions supply the process by 
which the world's judgment will finally be evolved. 
Contemporary criticism may be correct, it may be 
wrong ; but age will speak the truth, posterity will 
know. 

Debate, discussion, controversy, such has been 
the habit of human thought, and thus have the great 
institutions of humanity been developed. There is 
blasting in the quarry before the granite blocks can 
be piled up to build the capitol. In rolling-mills 



and foundries there is melting with fervent heat, 
and thunder of ponderous hammers, before steel 
plates can be riveted or iron girders be trussed into 
place. With heat and explosion has man wrought 
his way through the perplexities of speculation and 
science : is it not to be expected that in literary 
criticism his judgments will evolve as they have 
already evolved in philosophy and dogma? Let 
literary partisans have their say, and let no one in 
the court be shocked that counsel grows emphatic. 
The jury is intelligent, albeit slow ; the judge is 
qualified to try the case ; in the end, verdict and 
judgment will be found in accordance with the law ; 
there will be no exceptions and no appeal. 

In plain words, why shun controversy ? is there 
any disposition so to do? Oh, yes, Mr. Mealy- 
mouth dreads discussion. He is so modest that he 
jumps if someone contradicts him, and straightway 
sees the object in his vision from his opponent's 
view-point. Rarely does he hazard a downright 
affirmation : " I think," or " it seems to me," or 
" me judice" or " now possibly this is so." There 
are some who repeat the same expressions, not 
because of diffidence, but because of affectation. 
Neither they nor Mr. Mealymouth can be accounted 
helpers of mankind. The cry is for authority, 
which means knowledge, more of knowledge than 
the general ; not absolute, but approximating, ap- 
proaching the truth. What the world demands of 
the scholar is, not what he thinks he thinks, but 
what he thinks he knows. Gradually, honestly, 
inevitably, the world ponders, weighs his dictum. 
The thinking world will fix its value in time. 

There is, however, an old distinction not yet to 
be ignored : the distinction between opinion and 
conviction. The scientists discriminate better than 
the critics ; perhaps in the nature of materials it is 
easier for the former so to do. " What is your 
opinion with reference to thought transference?" 
asked an inquirer of Doctor Bose, the Hindoo scien- 
tist. " I must decline to express it. There is no 
experimental basis upon which to make a satisfac- 
tory statement," was the reply. Signer Marconi, 
the electrician, was asked if he believed that in a 
certain experiment waves of energy were actually 
sent through a hill. " That is my present belief, 
but I do not wish to state it as a fact. I am not 
certain," was his answer. Which might lead one 
to assert that the scholar's attitude is that of learner 
as well as teacher, always ; and, furthermore, that 
because the scholar thinks a thing is so, his thought 
does not make it so ; nor will his wish that a certain 
thing be true, of itself make his theory a fact. 

The literary world has made some progress in its 
ability to deal with candor and to reason temper- 
ately on differences of moment. " What an over- 
worn and bed-ridden argument is this ! the last 
refuge ever of old falsehood . . . this was the plea 
of Judaism and idolatry against Christ and his 
Apostles . . . these rotten principles," etc. Thus 
John Milton, in one of those mild confutations and 
animadversions wherein seventeenth-century schol-

arship delighted. And yet, in that age of intoler- 
ance, as in other ages when the fires have burned 
more fiercely, it is not difficult now to see that the 
fiery tongues that shot out and over and around 
were but the writhings of a single blaze, tongues of 
one great surging flame, of that purifying fire that 
tries the truth. They leaped a myriad ways, they 
divided, they flashed, they stung ; yet out of the 
flame walked Truth, unharmed, triumphant. 

Of course, to-day such burnings are incongruous 
and ought to be impossible ; yet there are occasions 
when the literary controversialist needs to be re- 
minded sharply that tolerance and calmness are not 
so much virtues as evidences of common sense ; and 
that gentlemen in debate allow intelligence and 
some freedom in deduction, even, to honorable 
opponents who have had the floor. Because he 
knows, or thinks he knows, the scholar need not 
expect everyone else to know in the self-same way ; 
still less need he expect praise from all quarters 
because he has published his knowledge to the world. 
The scholar, then, must keep his heart sweet and 
happy ; this is the great lesson, the hardest lesson 
of all. To be right, and not to lose one's temper ; 
to teach truth, and not turn cynic when the world 
does n't see it that way. Ruskin said of Albert 
Diirer, that someone found fault with his engraving. 
The artist replied, " It can 't be better done " 
" but," adds Ruskin, " he did n't get huffy ! " We 
wish the same statement might be true, by the way, 
concerning our vigorous and autocratic essayist 
himself. Who can read without amusement the 
trenchant footnotes with which Ruskin has peppered 
the pages of his earlier writings in the Brantwood 
edition of his works ! Here is a good example of 
modern testiness, somewhat in the old Miltonic style, 
which we find attached to a paragraph in " Stones 
of Venice," with reference to the architecture of 
Verona : " Alas, the noblest example of it, Fra 
Giocondo's exquisite loggia, has been daubed and 
damned, by the modern restorer, into a caricature 
worse than a Christmas clown's. The exquisite 
colors of the Renaissance fresco, pure as rose-leaves 
and dark laurel the modern Italian decorator 
thinks 'sporco,' and replaces by buff-color of oil- 
cloth, and Prussian green spluttering his gold 
about wherever the devil prompts him, to enrich the 
whole." Yet this is not so much humor as irasci- 
bility, and would hardly do, even for John Ruskin, 
did we not consider the sensitiveness and impatience 
of old age. Since the days of the great essayists 
and reviewers who, by the way, won their title 
because of something more than mere arrogance of 
style an " intelligent public " has not cared much 
for that sort of thing. The critic is clearly right in 
giving forcible expression to his mind ; but it is quite 
essential that he have a mind of some weight to ex- 
press, and that he utter his convictions with becom- 
ing respect for the convictions of those who differ. 
In the pages of " The Ettrick Shepherd " one may 
find this happy picture of the scholar asserting his 
own authority all the more admirable as coming 



from one who had submitted to extreme tests in the 
school of experience and adversity. " Gin I thocht 
Papistry a fause thing, which I do, I wadna scruple 
to say sae in sic terms as were consistent wi' gude 
manners, and wi' charity and humility of heart. But 
I wad ca' nae man a leear ! " If such amenity can 
be conceived as tempering theological debate, is it 
too much to hope for human nature that this genial 
spirit may pervade the field of criticism ?

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

MR. GRANT ALLEN AND COLLEGE EDUCATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The " Cosmopolitan " for October prosecutes Mr. 
Walker's holy war against existing educational methods 
and ideals, in somewhat bewildering fashion. It is not 
very hazardous to predict that many thoughtful readers 
of Mr. Grant Allen's article will draw from Mr. Allen's 
facts conclusions by no means identical with his. Mr. 
Allen is eager to see boys dispatched to foreign lands, 
to seek their education in travel, and gives a glowing 
account of the stimulus he himself received from such 
an experience. Just such an educational experiment as 
Mr. Allen suggests occurs to me; and it will illustrate 
Mr. Allen's theory perhaps quite as well as his own 
experience does. The subject of it, a young man of 
eighteen, informed me in our second talk that he had 
spent much of the previous year at a small place in Italy, 
adding, with evident reluctance at its obscurity, that it 
was called Verona: he supposed I had never heard of it. 
Perhaps this will be thought an extreme case to cite 
against Mr. Allen's theory of the educational sufficiency 
of travel; but it seems much more in point for the article 
in question than Mr. Allen's own experience, which is 
there cited. Mr. Allen came to his travels, as he him- 
self says, after years of bondage to the existing educa- 
tional system, and found historic scenes inexpressibly 
rich in significance and interest, and full of delightful 
stimulus. Are we therefore to conclude with Mr. Allen 
that his early servitude to Latin and Greek was a lament- 
able blunder ? Does not Mr. Allen's story rather seem 
a telling vindication of the value of just such studies, 
while his testimony is not less noteworthy for being 
unintentional ? 

We should doubtless strive to view the attitude or 
may we say the pose ? of the " Cosmopolitan " as the 
iconoclast in education, unprejudiced by other phases of 
its work. Yet it seems hardly accidental that the mag- 
azine which sometimes is on the verge of advocating 
educational nihilism is the one which lately outraged 
its readers by thrusting before them photographic repre- 
sentations of the distorted corpses of a battlefield, and 
which just now illustrates its superiority to traditional 
methods by spelling the divine immanence without an a.

SCIENTIFIC WORK IN RHETORIC. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The communication entitled " The Lack of Scientific 
Work in Rhetoric," which appeared in THE DIAL for 
September 16, left unsaid, it seems to me, some things

that are pertinent to the subject under discussion. 
There are, doubtless, few who would take exception to 
your contributor's arraignment of much that passes cur- 
rent in our schools and colleges as the science of rhetoric, 
the lifeless and deadening applications of an outworn 
philosophy, formulas whose chief virtue is, perhaps, that 
they are furthest removed from anything that could be 
called " rhetorical " in an objectionable sense; or, on the 
other hand, the more or less unpremeditated effusions 
that rest on no conscious philosophy at all. There can 
be no question as to the present vital need of a rhetoric 
whose methods shall be the methods of modern scientific 
investigation, and whose relations to the kindred social 
and psychological sciences shall be made explicit. But 
it does behoove us, when we have arrived at this view 
of the situation, to look about us with some concern to 
see whether there are any tendencies at work pressing 
forward in the right direction and only waiting for due 
encouragement. 

If the colleges are largely responsible for the unfruit- 
ful condition of rhetoric to-day and this seems to be 

the charge of the writer of the communication it is 

surely to them that we must look for aid, provided it is 
not unwarrantable to assume that they are endowed 
with a sense of moral responsibility. Upon them rests 
the obligation of answering for the kind of rhetoric they 
have been teaching and are teaching, when called to 
account. And the obligation is already being faced in 
the graduate departments of some of the larger univer- 
sities in a scientific way, as in the case of the University 
of Michigan, the first to offer graduate courses in rhe- 
toric, where for some years past graduate research 
work has been carried on with reference to various 
problems in rhetoric, involving the social sciences on the 
one side, and the laboratory methods of experimental 
psychology on the other. Just how far such researches 
as these have gone toward making for a truly scientific 
theory of rhetoric, it is difficult to say, because of the 
absence of any organ of communication between groups 
of investigators. It is one of the paradoxes of history 
that the science which is concerned primarily with com- 
munication, with the economics of the exchange and 
transportation of spiritual commodities, should have no 
organ of communication itself, no common carrier. This 
lack of a suitable medium of publication is enough to 
make one think that " the science of rhetoric is fifty to 
a hundred years behind economics and psychology." It 
explains, in a measure, why " the work of each writer 
is generally unadvantageously individual in some re- 
spects each author usually attempting to cover the 
whole field of the subject"; for such a state of affairs 
as this is due not merely to " the comparative absence 
of scientific methods," but also, and perhaps first of all, 
to the absence of an opportunity for comparing results 
attained, and so furthering " division of labor and intel- 
ligent cooperation." Some attempts have been made, 
I believe, toward satisfying this need of an organ of 
communication, as, for example, the publication, in con- 
nection with the courses already referred to, of the 
series entitled " Contributions to Rhetorical Theory." 
It will be through the encouragement of such attempts 
as these that a very immediate and practical rhetorical 
problem will be solved. 

If in working to bring about any reform, it is wisest 
to league with those elements that have begun, spon- 
taneously it may seem, to right the wrong and bring 
order out of lawlessness, so in the case of the present 
chaotic, and at the same time scholastic, condition of 



rhetorical theory, it may be well to seek out and try 
to further those tendencies which have begun to shape 
things anew for the better. WILLARD C. GORE.

A TEXT FROM TEXT-BOOKS. 

(To the Editor of THB DIAL.) 

It has been my fortune, as a teacher in a secondary 
school of some prominence, to receive from a dozen or 
more competing publishers a variety of editions of the 
English classics that are now required for admission to 
most American colleges. As fast as I have received 
these books I have placed them side by side in my 
library, until they now fill two or three shelves. In 
their motley array they present anything but a uniform 
appearance. They are bound in all sorts of colors, 
printed on all sorts of paper, and their original portions 
written in all sorts of styles, that is, when they are 
written at all, for some of them do not seem even to 
have been written, but simply put together. And while 
the ways of their editors are as varied as the colors in 
which the books themselves are bound, in one respect 
they are very much alike. Nearly all of them have a 
remarkable tendency (which they in nowise overcome) 
to fill their books with masses of unassimilated material 
with introductions which do not introduce, with notes 
which do not explain, and with suggestions which do 
not suggest. On the whole, these books, while they 
evidence the general awakening of interest in the study 
of English, appear also to emphasise the maze of meth- 
ods in which we are just now floundering. 

It has seemed to me that many of the sins commit- 
ted in these books may be laid to the fact that most of 
them are edited by men who have had no actual con- 
tact with secondary school work. Having taught in both 
college and high school, I maintain that it is not a suffi- 
cient qualification for a text- book editor merely to have 
observed " carefully the needs of students who present 
themselves for admission to college," as one prospectus 
puts it, but that some teaching experience in either the 
high school or the academy is essential to an apprecia- 
tion of the real needs of the secondary school student. 
I am further convinced of this when I observe one col- 
lege editor quoting in the introduction to his book some- 
thing like fifty pages of critical comment on his author 
and work, the most of which is bound to prove dry and 
hard reading for the average high-school student, and 
another printing more than one hundred pages of notes 
to less than half that number of text. A third, who 
crowds his pages with a multitude of questions that 
would occur at once to any live teacher, is no better. 

Is not the cause worthy of something better ? May 
we not have an edition of the English classics which 
will be the result of the united efforts of such of the 
secondary school teachers of the country as combine the 
necessary scholarship with some degree of literary abil- 
ity, sufficient, at any rate, to eliminate the unessen- 
tials which overload the books we now have, and to 
arrange the material used with a view to artistic effect ?

THE TEXNYSOX MEMOIRS.* 



" Old ghosts whose day was done ere mine began, 
If earth be seen from your conjectured heaven, 
Ye know that History is half-dream ay even 
The man's life in the letters of the man. 
There lies the letter, but it is not he 
As he retires into himself and is : 
Sender and sent-to go to make up this, 
Their offspring of this union. And on me 
Frown not old ghosts, if I be one of those 
Who make you utter things you did not say, 
And mould you all awry and mar your worth ; 
For whatsoever knows us truly, knows 
That none can truly write his single day, 
And none can write it for him upon earth." f 

In the foregoing Sonnet (written originally 
as a preface to " Becket," and first published 
in the work now before us) the late Lord 
Tennyson expressed incidentally his conviction 
of the essential insufficiency of all biography. 
Letters the most intimate, being unavoidably 
tinged by the personality of " sent-to " as well 
as "sender," but partially or fitfully reveal 
the writer "as he retires into himself and is " ; 
while if it is given to no man to " truly write 
his single day," then surely " none can write 
it for him upon earth." Lord Tennyson, as 
we learn, disliked the notion of a long, formal 
biography. For those who cared to know the 
spiritual side of his literary history, he wrote 
"Merlin and the Gleam." That figurative 
account of his poetic progress he seems to have 
thought "would probably be enough of bio- 
graphy for those friends who urged him to 
write about himself." But however modest his 
estimate of the biographical demands of these 
friends, he can scarcely have thought for a mo- 
ment that the veiled, mystical intimations of 
" Merlin," dim adumbrations of spiritual pro- 
cesses which the poet himself but imperfectly 
divined, would satisfy the curiosity of the gen- 
eral public, or indeed meet the questions which 
that public would be most likly to ask. Most 
men look to biography solely for the sort of 
personal information in which the prince of 
biographers, James Boswell, chiefly dealt ; and 
a biography of the Boswellian type, Lord Ten- 
nyson must have known was inevitable. From 
the disclosures of such a biography, were it ever 
so candid, he had little reason to shrink. Here, 
the unflinching pen of a Froude could point out 
no jarring discrepancies between the man and 
bis work. What Tennyson seemed to be to the

multitude, who viewed him solely through the 
transfiguring medium of his verse, he really was, 
to a quite exceptional degree. His life and his 
message were nobly of a piece. 

As we have already said, Tennyson disliked 
the idea of a long, formal biography. But as 
his life must inevitably be written, he was 
anxious that it be written once and for all 
that it be so written as to preclude the chance 
of further and unauthentic biographies. His 
wish in this regard seems to us to be met, as 
fully as it was possible to meet it, in the noble 
volumes now before us, the pious work of his 
son, the present Lord Tennyson. Some future 
aftermath of Tennysonian memories there will 
probably be ; but Lord Tennyson has given 
us what must remain for all time the one full 
and authoritative Life of his father. Touching 
his method, Lord Tennyson says : 

"According to my father's wish, throughout the 
memoir my hand will be as seldom seen as may be, and 
this accounts for the occasionally fragmentary charac- 
ter of my work. The anecdotes and sayings here 
related have been mostly taken down as soon as spoken, 
and are hence, I trust, not marred or mended by mem- 
ory, which, judging from some anecdotes of him 
recently published, is wont to be a register not wholly 
accurate." 

The foregoing paragraph fairly indicates 
the general form and character of the work, 
which is essentially a rich storehouse of Tenny- 
soniana, to which the best minds in England 
have lavishly contributed, rather than an 
attempt at a set recital and formal biography 
of the sort the poet himself would have disap- 
proved of. Regular narrative is not, of course, 
wholly wanting. Such facts as people natur- 
ally wish to know concerning the poet's ances- 
try, birth, homes, schools, college life, friend- 
ships, travels, etc., are given in order. As to 
manuscripts left by his father, Lord Tenny- 
son says : 

" The most interesting to me are my father's unpub- 
lished poems and letters, and notes on his own life and 
work left me for publication after his death, Arthur 
Hallam's letters, Edward Fitzgerald's private MS. notes, 
and the journal of our home life." 

As to the " unpublished poems," it is 
pleasant to say that the volumes are enriched 
with them to a degree more likely to surpass 
than to fall short of the hopes of the most san- 
guine Tennysonian. Lavish quotation of these 
belated treasures of song would be obviously 
unfair ; but we may venture on an extract or 
two, with the certainty of whetting, rather than 
appeasing, the reader's appetite. The follow- 
ing stanzas, entitled- " The Mother's Ghost," 
belong to the period 1832-35.

" Not a whisper stirs the gloom, 

It will be the dawning soon, 
We may glide from room to room, 

In the glimmer of the moon : 
Every heart is lain to rest, 

All the house is fast in sleep, 
Were I not a spirit blest, 

Sisters, I could almost weep ! 

" In that cradle sleeps my child, 

She whose birth brought on my bliss ; 
On her forehead undefiled 

I will print an airy kiss : 
See, she dreameth happy dreams, 

Her hands are folded quietly, 
Like to one of us she seems, 

One of us my child will be." * 

Of a later date than the foregoing verses are 
the indignant lines, written in the poet's under- 
graduate days, on " Cambridge of 1830 " 
the narrow and lethargic Cambridge of which 
Macaulay said : " We see men of four and five 
and twenty, loaded with academical honors and 
rewards scholarships, fellowships, whole cab- 
inets of medals, whole shelves of prize-books, 
enter into life with their education still to 
begin ; unacquainted with the first principles of 
the laws under which they live, unacquainted 
with the very rudiments of moral and political 
science." Cambridge was, in the eyes of the 
more practical and progressive, then an insti- 
tution consecrated by prejudice and immemorial 
usage to the business of launching upon the 
world a yearly batch of mediaeval-minded young 
gentlemen, who, so far as the training of their 
Venerable Mother went, were about as well 
fitted as so many Kaspar Hausers to grapple 
with the realities of practical life. The young 
Tennyson expressed his opinion of the prevail- 
ing regime in a sonnet which is perhaps more 
vigorous and biographically suggestive than 
poetic. 

" Therefore your Halls, your ancient Colleges, 
Your portals statued with old kings and queens, 
Your gardens, myriad-volumed libraries, 
Wax-lighted chapels, and rich-carven screens, 
Your doctors, and your proctors, and your deans, 
Shall not avail you when the Day-beam sports 
New-risen o'er awakened Albion. No ! 
Nor yet your organ-pipes that blow 
Melodious thunders thro' your vacant courts 
At noon and eve, because your manner sorts 
Not with this age wherefrom ye stand apart, 
Because the lips of little children preach 
Against you, you that do profess to teach 
And teach us nothing, feeding not the heart." * 

The voices of the new age, indeed, early 
awakened a responsive echo in the spirit of 
Tennyson. To the political issues that stirred 
England in his youth he was keenly alive. It 
is pleasantly related that when the news of the 
passing of the Reform Bill for England and 
Wales reached Somersby, the young Tenny-

sons, headed by the poet, rushed out into the 
darkness to the neighboring church, and rang 
the bells as madly as the " inspired tinker " 
himself might have rung them in the days of 
his unregenerate youth. Whereat, says the 
author of the Memoir, 

" The new parson, horrified at hearing his bells rung, 
and not merely rung but furiously clashed, without his 
leave, came rushing into his church, and in the pitch 
blackness laid hold of the first thing which he could 
clap hand to, and this happened to be my aunt Cecilia's 
little dog which forthwith tried to bite. The Tenny- 
sons then disclosed themselves amid much laughter; 
and the parson, who I suppose was a Tory of the old 
school, was with difficulty pacified. More than once 
my father thought of turning this scene into verse as an 
interesting picture of the times." 

An extremely interesting and valuable fea- 
ture of the work are the letters to and from 
Tennyson, with which both volumes are thickly 
studded. One of the earlier ones, from John 
Sterling, hits pleasantly at Carlyle. 

"Carlyle was here yesterday evening, growled at 
having missed you, and said more in your praise than 
in anyone's except Cromwell and an American back- 
woodsman who has killed thirty or forty people with a 
bowie-knife and since run away to Texas." 

A letter to Dean Bradley (1855) acknowl- 
edges the receipt of a volume of Matthew 
Arnold. 

" Many thanks for the Arnold : nobody can deny that 
he is a poet. ' The Merman ' was an old favorite of 
mine, and I like him as well as ever. ' The Scholar 
Gipsy ' is quite new to me, and I have an affection for 
him, which I think will increase." 

Apropos of the foregoing letter, it may be 
noted that the author was entrusted years later 
by his father with the following message for 
Mr. Arnold : " Tell Mat not to write any more 
of those prose things like ' Literature and 
Dogma,' but to give us something like his 
'Thyrsis,' 'Scholar Gipsy,' or 'Forsaken 
Merman.' " Mr. Arnold naturally took the 
monition in good part, and told the story glee- 
fully " all over London." 

In a note from Mr. Herbert Spencer, the 
reader may possibly discern a tinge of uncon- 
scious humor. 

" I happened recently to be re-reading your Poem 
' The Two Voices,' and coming to the verse 
' Or if thro' lower lives I came 
Tho' all experience past became 
Consolidate in mind and frame ' 

it occurred to me that you might like to glance through 
a book which applies to the elucidation of mental 
science the hypothesis to which you refer. I therefore 
beg your acceptance of ' Psychology,' which I send by 
this post." 

Whether or no the laureate " glanced through " 
Mr. Spencer's formidable chef-d'oeuvre is not

recorded. Touching the philosophical content 
of Tennyson's work, Professor Jowett (a, fre- 
quently recurring name in the " Life ") once 
observed : 

" Your poetry has an element of philosophy more to be 
considered than any regular philosophy in England. It 
is almost too much impregnated with philosophy, yet 
this to some minds will be its greatest charm. I 
believe that your ' In Memoriam ' and ' Crossing the 
Bar ' will live forever in men's hearts." 

One may venture to suggest here, in all defer- 
ence, that Tennyson's poetry, especially the 
pieces cited by the Master of Balliol, may be 
said to be impregnated with the " breath and 
finer spirit " of the current " regular phil- 
osophy in England," rather than to be remark- 
able for any such element of their own distinct 
from that philosophy. Do not, for instance, 
the groups of stanzas in " In Memoriam " 
numbered LIV., LV., and LVL, really sum 
up and nobly transfigure what may be termed 
the " Gospel of Modern Thought " ? Having 
cited Professor Jowett, we may fitly quote 
here from a letter by him to Lady Tennyson 
(1858), in which he incidentally appraises 
criticism as a form of literature. 

"You asked me whether I could suggest any sub- 
jects for poetry. I have been so presumptuous as to 
think of some. I don't believe that poetical feelings 
and imagery can ever be exhausted. That is only a 
fancy which comes over us when our minds are dry or 
in moments of depression. This generation is certainly 
more poetical and imaginative than the last, and per- 
haps, in spite of the critics, the next may be more poet- 
ical than our own. And as to the critics, their power 
is not really great. Wagon-loads of them are lighting 
fires every week or on their way to the grocers. I often 
fancy that the critical form of modern literature is like 
the rhetorical one which overlaid ancient literature, and 
will be regarded as that is, at its true worth in after 
times. One drop of natural feeling in poetry or the 
true statement of a single new fact is already felt to be 
of more value than all the critics put together." 

Tennyson's allusions to America and Amer- 
icans are throughout generally in a kindly 
spirit enough though we find him, in a letter 
to Mr. Gladstone (1872), threatening that "If 
you let those Yankees get anything like their 
way of you in the Alabama claims, I wont pay 
my ' ship-money ' any more than old Hamp- 
den." A letter of later date, however (to Dr. 
Van Dyke), contains the assurance that " The 
report (which you quote) that I dislike Amer- 
icans is wholly without foundation, though it is 
true that I have protested against the manner 
in which some of the American publishers have 
pilfered my work." 

Lord Tennyson, of course, had the penalties 
as well as the rewards of his popularity on this 



side the water. He was long one of the stock 
" objects of interest " for the transatlantic 
tourist. It is recorded that one misguided en- 
thusiast descended upon Aldworth with the 
staggering announcement that he had worked 
his way across the Atlantic in a cattle ship, 
solely in order to recite " Maud " to its author 
which he forthwith proceeded to do. " Hav- 
ing pity on the man," says the narrator, " my 
father allowed him to do so, but suffered from 
the recitation. We paid the reciter's passage 
back to America, but never heard of him 
again." 

Lord Tennyson's Life of his father is un- 
unquestionably a book that permanently and 
appreciably enriches English literature. It is 
hardly possible to conceive of a generation to 
come that it will not deeply interest, contain- 
ing as it does the best and truest that could be 
said of Alfred Lord Tennyson, as man and as 
poet, by those of his contemporaries who were 
best qualified to speak of him. It is a book 
eloquent of pious toil, of modest self-repres- 
sion, of filial solicitude lest the bounds of a 
somewhat difficult prescribed standard be over- 
stepped, of anxiety to leave no source untried 
whence a ray of real biographical light was to 
be looked for. Lord Tennyson has been 
liberally and directly assisted in his work by 
his father's more intimate and eminent friends. 
Tennyson's letters to and from the Queen are 
piously enshrined by his son in a separate 
chapter. The opening volume is prefixed by a 
Chronology of the Books of Poems ; and the 
Index, we are glad to say, is a notably full and 
helpful one. In their material features the 
volumes are impeccable. The superb series 
of portraits fitly crowns a work which is a 
veritable literary feast from cover to cover. 
One more example of the generous aftermath 
of Tennysonian song we shall venture to give 
in closing an unpublished version of " Sweet 
and Low." 

" Bright is the moon on the deep, 
Bright are the cliffs in her beam, 
Sleep, my little one, sleep ! 
Look, he smiles and opens his hands, 
He sees his father in distant lands, 
And kisses him there in a dream, 
Sleep, sleep. 

" Father is over the deep, 
Father will come to thee soon, 
Sleep my pretty one, sleep ! 
Father will come to his babe in the nest, 
Silver sails all out of the west, 
Under the silver moon, 
Sleep, sleep!"*

THE FOUNDATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE.* 
Somewhat more than two hundred years ago, 
a company of gentlemen were engaged in the 
discussion of a problem of metaphysics. The 
longer they considered the question, the more 
completely they found themselves at sea. 
Finally it occurred to one of their number, a 
Mr. John Locke, that their difficulties were 
caused by their failure to raise a fundamental 
question, namely, What are the powers of the 
human mind ; how much can we know, and 
how much from the very nature of our faculties 
must remain forever unknown ? Locke under- 
took to jot down a few thoughts on this subject 
for the benefit of his friends, and out of these 
detached notes grew the famous " Essay Con- 
cerning Human Understanding." Thus was 
launched a new science, which to-day is known 
by the name of epistemology, or theory of 
knowledge. Not that Locke is entitled to be 
considered its founder, in any other sense than 
that in which Stevenson may be called the 
inventor of the locomotive. What he did was 
to so demonstrate the utility of this new discip- 
line by his own contributions as to assure it a 
permanent place in the world of philosophic 
thought. 

It cannot be truthfully said that epistemology 
has always enjoyed a great share of popular 
favor. Its problems seem at first sight too 
remote from the interests of every-day life to 
be worth the effort and time necessary for their 
study. But the past generation has witnessed 
something of a revolution in this respect. The 
term agnosticism, introduced into the language 
by Professor Huxley, has called the attention 
of the public to a theory which if true is felt 
to be of the greatest importance to every human 
being. Following Hume, whose interpreter 
he has made himself, Huxley declares that our 
only source of knowledge of the world without 
us is sensation. But all sensations, even those 
of sight and touch, are mere feelings which tell 
us nothing of the real nature of anything out- 
side of ourselves. Hence it is concluded that 
the world conceived to lie behind these sub- 
jective phenomena as their cause is absolutely 
inaccessible to human reason ; wherefore the 
theologian and the metaphysician, since they 
attempt to penetrate into this region, are on 
the same intellectual plane as the would-be 
inventor of the perpetual-motion machine. 



* THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE. A Contribution to some 
Problems of Logic and Metaphysics. By L. T. Hobhouse, 
Fellow and Assistant-Tutor at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. 
New York : The Macmillan Co. 



Within very recent years, Mr. Balfour has 
given new life to the popular discussion of epis- 
temological questions. He has striven to show 
that there is evidence for the existence of God, 
the immortality of the soul, and the ultimate 
triumph of right over wrong, of equal validity 
with that for the accepted results of physical 
science. Scientific theories are never matters 
of experience in the strict sense of the term. 
They simply represent the way in which cer- 
tain observed facts must be put together if 
any explanation for them exists. Thus at the 
foundation of science lies the faith that all 
experience is ultimately explainable ; and the 
sole warrant for this faith, it is claimed, is 
the felt need of such explanation. But if this 
craving carries with it its own warrant of satis- 
faction, the same claim may be urged for all 
the other deeper cravings of our nature. If 
this be true, our belief in the existence of 
Providence may have exactly the same foun- 
dation as that in the uniformity of nature which 
is the basis of all generalization in science. 
Most readers will be familiar with the form 
which Browning has given to this doctrine. 
Other thinkers as, notably, Coleridge, Car- 
lyle, and Emerson have sought a different 
way out of agnosticism. They maintained the 
existence of certain intuitions which give us a 
direct knowledge of the invisible world, and 
acquaint us with those truths which are of 
most concern to our deeper life. Sometimes 
these intuitions are described as if they were 
revelations vouchsafed by a higher power to 
those whose lives render them worthy recip- 
ients of the message. Others have assimilated 
them to mathematical axioms, the truth of 
which the mind perceives as soon as they are 
presented. In one form or another, the doc- 
trine that what is non-existent for sense may 
thus be clear to the eye of reason, has been a 
favorite tenet from the time of Plato to the 
present day. 

It is the office of epistemology to examine 
these various conflicting contentions. It en- 
quires what we may know, how we gain our 
knowledge, and by what touchstone we may 
distinguish false beliefs from true. Its prov- 
ince is not confined to the question of the pos- 
sibility of knowing the supersensible world, 
but extends to all branches of human inquiry. 
It investigates, among other things, the condi- 
tions of that great body of knowledge upon 
which our so-called practical activity depends, 
and the grounds and justification of our gen- 
eralizations from what has happened in the

past to what will happen in the future ; it asks 
what is to be understood by the terms sub- 
stance, cause, and many others which we use 
confidently enough in daily life with but vague 
notions of their exact significance. No de- 
partment of the subject lies remote from the 
stir and hum of modern intellectual life. The 
nature of the relation of mind and body, for 
instance, can be discussed intelligently only 
when we understand the meaning of the word 
cause ; while the controversy which Professor 
Ostwald has recently started * proves that the 
final interpretation of the facts brought to light 
by chemistry and physics requires an answer 
to the previous question, What is matter, and 
where do we get the evidence of its existence ? 
Of the treatises dealing with the theory of 
knowledge, that which Mr. Hobhouse has re- 
cently given us is the most complete, as it is 
one of the ablest and most satisfactory, in the 
English language. No other English work 
covers the field so thoroughly. This fact, taken 
in connection with the keenness of analysis, 
sanity of judgment, and clearness of exposition 
exhibited throughout, make the work indispen- 
sable to the specialist, and at the same time 
admirably suited to the needs of the beginner. 
In his doctrine of matter, the author shows 
himself quite out of sympathy with the views 
held by the great majority of students of the 
subject, and the arguments advanced in sup- 
port of his position will probably strike most 
readers as more ingenious than convincing ; but 
even here the hall-mark of a great work is not 
wanting we learn as much from a chapter 
whose final conclusions we reject as from one 
whose reasoning carries with it complete con- 
viction. In general we seem to be reading a 
book which Locke might have written after the 
work of Hume and Kant, Mill and Green. 

The ultimate source of all the knowledge we 
as yet, at any rate, possess, is, we are told, the 
direct experience of a given content of con- 
sciousness. This represents the same thought 
which Locke intended to express when he laid 
down his famous proposition that the source of 
all knowledge is experience, as given in sensa- 
tion on the one hand, and the consciousness of 
the operations of our own minds on the other. 
These contents may be remembered and ana- 
lyzed ; they may be subjected to the process of 
construction (or synthesis) by which wholes 
arise which have never before been given in 
their entirety (one example of this is the work 
of the imagination) ; and, finally, under certain 
*See " Popular Science Monthly," March, 1896. 



conditions which it is the office of inductive 
logic to point out, the relations which obtain 
between the different elements of a content of 
consciousness may be generalized, so that we 
may affirm that what is perceived to be con- 
joined here and now will be found together 
everywhere and always. The axioms of mathe- 
matics are shown to be special cases under this 
principle, and so by implication the existence 
of a separate faculty to account for them is 
denied. 

Such, according to Mr. Hobhouse, are the 
processes by which knowledge is gained. But 
now, what grounds have we for supposing that 
they terminate in truth? Of course, we all 
know how one judgment may be corrected by 
comparison with another, and one observation 
by others more carefully conducted ; but the 
question is, what right have we to believe that 
our faculties, even when working in their per- 
fection, lead us to truth at all ? The reply is 
that when the deliverances of our various "fac- 
ulties " form a completely consistent system 
one from which all contradictions have been 
eliminated no motive and no rational justifi- 
cation remain for distrusting them. We begin, 
and we must end, with assuming that the work- 
ings of the mind are such that where har- 
monious they reveal to us reality. Any other 
assurance it would be senseless to demand. We 
thus find our questions answered as follows : 
We may know whatever is given in immediate 
experience, or is remembered, or may be in- 
ferred from the data supplied by experience ; 
the conditions of knowledge are the working of 
the processes already enumerated ; the justifica- 
tion for any confidence we may feel in them is 
the fact that their reports are consistent and 
mutually support each other. 

With reference to Mr. Balfour's contention, 
Mr. Hobhouse admits that the wants and crav- 
ings of our ethical and religious nature are 
capable of creating their own beliefs, or at 
least of influencing us in the selection of our 
creeds. Moreover, he thinks this procedure 
may ultimately be able to justify itself before 
the bar of reason. But, as against Mr. Balfour, 
he urges that as yet there is no agreement as 
to just what these needs are, and what is neces- 
sary for their satisfaction. Until the partisans 
of this view are at one on these points, he re- 
gards their claims as not worth the considera- 
tion of a serious thinker. In this attenuated 
form, the doctrine that you may believe what 
you very much want to believe (for, notwith- 
standing all disclaimers, this is what it comes

to) will probably do no harm. Of course, the 
possession of truth ordinarily yields a satis- 
faction of its own, and is often pursued for 
the sake of this satisfaction. But the " logical 
Pharisee " can point out that there must be, 
and is, other justification for the trust in our 
intellectual processes beyond the satisfaction 
they yield ; and if so, the entire argument of 
Mr. Balfour falls to the ground. This by no 
means cuts us off from all access to the world 
of ultimate reality. The complete explanation 
of experience compels us to transcend expe- 
rience, as even agnosticism will be found to 
admit. Here, then, is a legitimate sphere for 
a scientific metaphysics, permanent contribu- 
tions to which may be found in the works of all 
the great masters of philosophy.

THE STUDY OF ENGLISH WORDS.* 

The growing interest in the study of En- 
glish in our universities and secondary schools 
is especially encouraging to those who realize 
how absolutely human progress is dependent on 
the ability to record and to communicate facts 
and ideas. The impatience of " practical peo- 
ple " with the study of language would be an 
insoluble puzzle to the thoughtful observer, if 
the ungrateful tendency of human nature to 
take for granted the most important elements in 
well-being were not too familiar to need more 
than a passing mention. " Practical people " 
above all others ought to recognize the value of 
words. The idealist may imagine, in some 
vague way, that thought can communicate itself 
without expression ; but to those who deal with 
the visible and tangible, the embodiment of the 
thought should be scarcely less important than 
the thought itself. That its importance is not 
more generally realized is due to the fact that 
a fit medium of expression is, like air and sun- 
shine, usually taken for granted. When the 
public can be made to understand that discrim- 
ination is as necessary in the choice of words 
as in the selection of materials for a bicycle or 
a bridge or for a durable garment, a great step 
will have been taken in popular education. 

In these democratic days the educational ten- 
dency is, as has been often pointed out, to level 
down rather than to level up. The humanities 
are sacrificed to the sciences ; studies that ele- 
vate and refine are subordinated to the so-called

utilities of life. Under these circumstances, 
those who believe that " man does not live by 
bread alone " find ample ground for encourage- 
ment in the rapidly growing interest in that 
great English literature which, in addition to 
its native vigor, has shown a remarkable power 
of absorbing what is best in other literatures. 
The study of English as language has not 
hitherto kept pace with the study of English 
as literature ; yet the appreciation of English 
as literature is inevitably dependent on the 
understanding of English as language, an 
axiomatic truth that is obscured by the habit 
of taking the understanding of English for 
granted. Every other art must be taught; but 
one of the most difficult and most vitally im- 
portant of all the arts, the art of expression, 
is supposed to be acquired instinctively. It is 
acquired, to a certain extent, not instinctively, 
but unconsciously, by a few highly-favored in- 
dividuals those who are born into families 
where words are carefully chosen, where nice 
distinctions are made, where books of the high- 
est type are intimate companions ; yet in order 
that the choice of words may be intelligent, 
these unconscious influences must be, and in 
such families generally are, supplemented by 
systematic training. The old custom of teach- 
ing children Latin at an early age, and the con- 
sequent discovery, in childhood, that ideas do 
not necessarily arise with the words to fit them, 
and that the selection of the right word is a 
matter requiring care and thought, gave the 
needed stimulus to the sense of discrimination. 
Now that the study of Latin is postponed to a 
later period in school life, or more frequently 
omitted altogether, while teachers in the grade 
schools are often familiar with no language but 
their own, and in many cases not intelligently 
familiar with that, indications that the scientific 
study of English is working down from the uni- 
versities to the secondary schools, with a conse- 
quent improvement in the methods of the pri- 
mary schools, cannot be too heartily welcomed. 
In connection with these indications, the 
appearance of a text-book of English words, 
that is written on scientific principles, is of 
peculiar interest to all who believe that an in- 
telligent use and understanding of the English 
language is the fundamental requisite of a 
good education ; and that, in the last analysis, 
that use and understanding must be conditioned 
on a keen sense of the value of words. " A 
Study of English Words," by Miss Jessie Mac- 
millan Anderson, is evidently the work of one 
who combines with an unusual appreciation of 



218 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



the English language, and a scientific training 
in its principles, a rare power of imparting her 
own interest and knowledge to the untrained 
and unscientific mind. Many valuable books 
have been written to give information on this 
subject to those already interested in it ; this 
little book is one to awaken an interest where 
none has yet been felt. The ideal method of 
teaching English is undoubtedly by means of 
good literature in the hands of a competent 
teacher; but competent teachers of English 
are scarce in the places where they are most 
needed. A careful study of such a book as 
this in our grammar schools would do much to 
prepare those who in a few years will be the 
teachers in our grade schools to guide their 
pupils into an intelligent interest in words and 
language. 

Perhaps Miss Anderson's book may be best 
described by saying that it is organic, not 
mechanical, as most books are that deal with 
stems and prefixes and suffixes for school use. 
Her method insures for words and language 
the same vital interest that school children feel 
in natural history and botany when properly 
taught. Beginning with language as a living, 
growing thing, having its periods of childhood, 
youth, maturity, and old age, with its family 
relationships and family resemblances, and 
going on to trace specifically the growth of the 
English language, with its various possibilities 
of combination and modification and their ac- 
tual outcome, the reader is brought to the 
difficult and technical matter of roots and 
stems with a sufficiently living interest to vivify 
even those dry bones ; much as the student of 
botany, in tracing processes of plant life and 
growth, becomes sufficiently enthusiastic to 
carry over his enthusiasm into the pursuit of 
botanical names. Following the study of deri- 
vations, which embodies the results of the lat- 
est linguistic research, are chapters on the 
growth and change in the meaning of words, 
on the relative merits of Saxon and Latin 
English, on the artist's and scientist's use of 
words, on synonyms and on prose rhythms, 
which will be welcomed by those teachers who 
believe, with Miss Anderson, that the best 
methods are not too good for our boys and 
girls, and that the unconscious choice of one 
word rather than another should be developed 
at the earliest possible age into intelligent se- 
lection. The result is that while the book is 
precisely what is needed to supplement the in- 
dividual work of teachers, it is safe to say that 
many educated men and women would find in 



it much to heighten their appreciation of the 
literature that they now read with pleasure and 
profit, without knowing why. Nowhere else 
can we find, in as convenient a form, so much 
that we all ought to know, but that few of us, 
except special students, do know, about our 
language. And it is all told with a freshness 
of treatment that will attract the student, and 
at the same time with a vividness and sympa- 
thetic appeal that will awaken and hold the 
interest of any intelligent school boy or girl. 
Miss Anderson evidently remembers what too 
many writers for young people forget, that a 
great many books that we call classics are the 
favorite books of boys and girls. Her " hope 
that this elementary work may help toward the 
time when our boys and girls shall know more 
of their English tongue, and shall feel increas- 
ingly the charm and worth of their language 
inheritance," will be echoed with firm assurance 
by those who see clearly just where this book 
would have helped them in their own school 
days. The important thing in education is, 
not to be carried along, but to be started on the 
right track ; and this interesting and sugges- 
tive book is admirably planned to start boys 
and girls, as well as older persons, on the right 
track in the study of words and literature.

ESSAYS ON MAN AND DESTINY.* 

One of the striking features of Mr. Karl 
Pearson's new volume of " Studies in Evolu- 
tion " is the varied character of the " stud- 
ies." It is not lessened by reading the author's 
preface. In it he says : " To some readers a 
few words of explanation on the apparent want 
of unity in the contents of this book may seem 
desirable." The unity which he himself be- 
lieves exists in them is, " the endeavour to see 
all phenomena, physical and social, as a con- 
nected growth, and describe them as such in 
the briefest formula possible." Fully recog- 
nizing this, and being in hearty sympathy with 
the author, we still find his matter extremely 
varied. 

Of a certain series of these essays, mathe- 
matical in character, " The Chances of Death " 
may be selected as typical. It is a study of 
the mathematical curve of mortality. In an 
ingenious and remarkably readable way, Mr.

LUTION. By Karl Pearson. In two volumes. New York :

Pearson calls attention to the peculiarities and 
components of this curve. It is really a com- 
pound, the resultant of several simple curves, 
each with its influence. The mortality from 
birth to death does not tell the whole story : 
the curve extends back of the point of birth, 
taking in pre-natal death. The famous me- 
diaeval " dance of death " is inexact. 

" Artistically we no longer think of death as striking 
chaotically: we regard his aim as perfectly regular 
in the mass, if unpredicable in the individual instance. 
It is no longer the Dance of Death which pictures for us 
Death carrying off indiscriminately the old and the 
young, the rich and the poor, the toiler and the idler, 
the babe and its grandsire. We see something quite 
different: the cohort of a thousand tiny mites starting 
across the Bridge of Life, and growing in stature as 
they advance, till at the far end of the bridge we see 
only the graybeard and the ' lean and slippered panta- 
loon.' As they pass along the causeway the throng is 
more and more thinned. Five Deaths are posted at 
different stages of the route alongside the bridge, and, 
with different skewness of aim and different weapons of 
precision, they fire at the human target, till none remain 
to reach the end of the causeway the limit of life." 

To illustrate his conception, the author has 
caused a quaint and striking picture of the 
bridge of life to be drawn. 

Of the other purely mathematical essays, 
"Variation in Man and Woman" is most 
valuable. It is commonly stated in anthropo- 
logical writings that man is more variable than 
woman. Mr. Havelock Ellis, in "Man and 
Woman," makes the statement direct and un- 
qualified, and considers it a matter of prime 
importance. Mr. Pearson " lays the axe to the 
root of this pseudo-scientific superstition." He 
presents the most carefully treated mass of 
data ever dealt with, and outlines a proper 
mode of examining it. Seventeen anthropo- 
logical characters are investigated, and in 
eleven of these woman appears to present 
the greater variation. In the important mat- 
ters of weight, stature, girth, grip, and skull 
capacity, woman is the more variable. This 
greater variability of woman is attributed to 
" her relatively less severe struggle for exist- 
ence." In his final conclusion the author 
makes a fairly vigorous thrust at Mr. Ellis, 
saying : " Those writers who find in this prin- 
ciple [man's greater variability], not only 
' social and practical consequences of the wid- 
est significance,' but also an explanation of the 
peculiar characteristics 'of the whole of our 
human civilization,' are scarcely to be trusted 
when they deal with the problems of sex." 
Whatever the final verdict of science in the 
matter for our author does not consider his 
paper exhaustive, the essay is one of the most 



important that has, for a long time past, ap- 
peared in physical anthropology. 

The rigid application of mathematics to the 
theory of natural selection in society and the 
important discussions of the present anti-science 
drift of thought, while both interesting and 
important, may not detain us. The clever 
studies in the second volume, " Woman as 
Witch," " Ashiepattle, or Hans Seeks His 
Luck," "Kindred Group Marriages," "The 
German Passion Play," demand notice. They 
deal more or less directly with the marvellously 
instructive mediaevalism of Europe. The first 
three are studies in customs and words to se- 
cure survival data of the old " mother-right." 
The last is a study of the matter, spirit, and 
significance of the great religious drama, " A 
Study in the Evolution of Western Christian- 
ity." In them all the author shows a wealth 
of accumulated material and marked originality 
in treatment. His style is terse, clear, and 
vigorous : himself a radical, a materialist, a 
socialist, his work is always candid, his treat- 
ment sympathetic. His application of mathe- 
matics in some fields where it has hitherto been 
omitted is bound to stop much loose thinking 
and indefinite statement. His work, curious 
and interesting in its range and varied char- 
acter, must stimulate workers, for it bears the 
stamp of honesty and independence.

RECENT STUDIES IN EDUCATION.* 

One of the most interesting and important books 
in recent pedagogical literature is Mrs. Mary R. 
Ailing- Aber's " An Experiment in Education." The 
experiment described in this book was made in a 
primary department in Boston, in 1881, and the 
aim of the experiment was " to see if the child may 
not be introduced at once to the foundations of all 
learning the natural and physical sciences, mathe- 
matics, literature including language, and history 
and at the same time be given a mastery of such 
elements of reading, writing, and number as usually 
constitute primary education." On another page

[Oct. 16, 



the similar experiment at Englewood, Illinois, is 
briefly set forth. Bat the bulk of the book is given 
up to general ideas which these experiments sug- 
gested, and to remarks on their special application 
to the teaching of science, history, literature, and so 
forth. The writer believes in giving to children 
two years old and upward the same mental nourish- 
ment as to adults, and in doing this " fearlessly "; 
and her observations and reflections on this matter 
are of great interest. The special value of the book 
is that it brings out the new ideas on education 
clearly and definitely on the basis of actual experi- 
ment; but the work would have been doubly valu- 
able if it had been more fully illustrated by example 
and incident. We commend this very original, 
sound, and suggestive little book to all teachers, and 
especially to all those in kindergarten and primary 
grades. 

Another book which ought to be very useful to 
teachers in every department is " FroebeFs Educa- 
tional Laws for all Teachers," by Mr. James L. 
Hughes. The main object of this book is to show 
that Froebel's ideas and methods are significant for 
the whole scheme of education from kindergarten to 
university. This work consists of quotations from 
Froebel giving his general ideas on education, with 
a running exposition and comment partly original 
with Mr. Hughes and partly selected. There are 
interesting chapters on Unity, Self-Activity, Play, 
Apperception, Evolution, and so forth. The work 
is uncritical, and perhaps over-eulogistic. Though 
very enthusiastic, it is always sane. While Mr. 
Hughes has given a serviceable and careful presen- 
tation of the subject, the book is too scrappy and 
general ; and there is still need of a very simple 
work which from abundant examples shall set forth 
clearly, without any manifold quotations, the Froe- 
belian principles. 

" School Management and School Methods," by 
Professor Joseph Baldwin, is an outline manual 
designed especially for classes of teachers. It em- 
phasises the direct teaching of morals and religion, 
and is opposed to " rewards, per-cent marking, 
formal examinations, and corporal punishment ! " 
The author discusses educational conditions, facili- 
ties, school-government, class management, school 
and college organization, and methods of teaching. 
In the main it is up to date, though under the ac- 
count of school libraries we do not find any descrip- 
tion of the traveling-library scheme. The style is 
oral, and very jerky in its repetition of short, abrupt 
sentences. The tone is very enthusiastic, but rather 
crudely so. While as a syllabus the book has some 
merit, yet there is so much vague and general treat- 
ment that it will hardly be of the highest value to 
teachers. Further, for such a work the references 
to the literature of the subject should be far more 
full and explicit than we find here. 

In Mr. J. C. Tarver's " Observations of a Foster 
Parent " we have a pleasantly written book whose 
object is the very praiseworthy one of mediating 
between the parent and the foster parent or teacher, 



of making their relation more intelligent and sym- 
pathetic. Mr. Tarver avows that he has written this 
book " chiefly for the sake of earnest and anxious 
persons who have no means of knowing what is the 
best thing to do for their children, or of measuring 
what is being done for them by others." To this 
end he has put together some thirty short discursive 
chapters on studies, methods, pupil's mind and char- 
acter, schools, etc. The book is very readable, and 
contains some shrewd observations. But the point 
of view is ultra-English and conservative, and it 
would hardly be of much use to the American 
reader. There is certainly room for a first- rate 
book which shall address the American parent from 
the most advanced point of American educational 
progress. 

A book which fulfils this aim in one way with 
reference to young women is Mrs. Kate Holliday 
Claghorn's " College Training for Women." This 
book, by a college woman, on collegiate instruction 
for women, will be of especial service to parents and 
intending students, but will also have a considerable 
interest for the public at large. There is sound dis- 
cussion and advice on such subjects as " Choosing a 
College," Life at College," " The Graduate Stu- 
dent," "The College-Trained Mother," "The Col- 
lege-Woman as a Social Influence" and "College 
Training for the Wage-Earner." While not very 
mature in thought or expression, the writer is intel- 
ligent, earnest, and enthusiastic, and her little book 
will be of real service in its field. Though she does 
not discuss directly the problem of co-education, 
her remarks apply both to colleges exclusively for 
women and to co-educational institutions.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



English history 
down to date. 



Mr. Justin McCarthy has become his 
own continuator ; and to his " His- 
tory of Our Own Times," published 
in 1878, he has added a concluding volume (Har- 
per), bringing the narrative down to the Diamond 
Jubilee. It is a delightful book, even if it is not 
history. As might be expected, it is chiefly made 
up of Mr. McCarthy's recollections and reflections. 
A man who has been a large part of the events he 
describes can hardly be asked to encumber himself 
with the paraphernalia of the scientific historian 
when he means to write a good-humored description 
of the recent past. If one wishes to make oneself 
conversant with English affairs of the day, there 
can be no pleasanter method than the reading of so 
charming a book. Perhaps upon occasion one might 
desire a little more boldness in putting in the darker 
lines of the picture. For example, Mr. McCarthy, 
in describing the Queen's Jubilee of 1887, is com- 
pelled to record the fact that Ireland had no share 
in the festivities. There is a note of hesitancy and 
apology in each succeeding sentence, as if he desired 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

to minimize the effect of what he is obliged to say. 
Finally, however, his opinion appears, when to the 
statement that O'Connell aroused much enthusiasm 
for the young Queen, he adds : " The enthusiasm 
inspired by O'Connell soon began to chill and die. 
To Ireland, the Sovereign became a mere name or 
a mere myth, for the Crown was only represented 
by a partisan viceroy, who was changed with each 
succeeding change of partisan government." The 
story of the schism in the Nationalist party after 
Mr. Parnell was dragged into the divorce court 
is managed with equal delicacy or deftness, 
and this is not a little significant, since Mr. Mc- 
Carthy himself was the leader of the men opposed 
to Mr. Parnell. He speaks of the quarrel only in- 
cidentally, in stating the time of Mr. Parnell's 
death, and does not mention his own connection 
with the matter ; he merely says : " The great ma- 
jority elected a new chairman." This same quality 
of charitableness Mr. McCarthy carries into the 
discussion of England's foreign entanglements in 
Egypt, in the Transvaal, and with the United States 
about the Venezuela boundary line. He intimates 
that " we cannot know what was the real occasion, 
or inspiration, or purpose of President Cleveland's 
sudden burst of aggressive eloquence." But the 
"eloquence" was soon over, and Mr. Cleveland 
became " cool, sensible, and conciliatory." Quite 
characteristic of Mr. McCarthy's volume are the 
quiet pauses in the narrative to comment upon 
poets, orators, scientists, and statesmen, dead since 
1878. The estimates are unusually discriminating. 
They are written in the spirit of one to whom his 
own life seems a completed work, completed in the 
days when these men were the companions of his 
thoughts and his actions. Such a writer is not a 
historian : he has an advantage over the historian. 
Each fact is not something the relations of which 
he is professionally bound to elucidate : each fact 
is a part of his own life. And yet, unlike the man 
with an autobiography on his mind, he is able to 
ignore himself and to pass through his life again 
incognito. 

A continuation of Th . e second volume of Prof. Moses 
the literary history Coit Tyler's ' ' Literary History of the 
of the Revolution. American Revolution" (Putnam) 
has quickly followed the first one. The whole work 
covers the period 1763-1783, the dividing line be- 
tween the two volumes falling in 1776. " The chief 
aim of the first volume," says the author, " is to 
trace the development of political discontent in the 
Anglo- American colonies from about the year 1763 
until the year when that discontent culminated in the 
resolve for American Independence ; while the chief 
aim of the second volume is to trace the develop- 
ment of the Revolutionary struggle under the altered 
conditions produced by this change in its object and 
in its character, and to go on with the tale until the 
year when American Independence was formally 
acknowledged by the British government." The 
first period is longer than the second one, and is 



more abundant in matter; and the first volume, 
upon the whole, is more interesting than the second. 
Still, the author has not rigidly observed the line of 
bisection. In the treatment of a few great topics, 
he has given himself, as he explains, larger room 
and freer movement than would be possible under 
a rigorous conformity to the time limits imposed by 
his general plan. Sometimes, no doubt, there are 
advantages in departing from the rule, as in the 
cases of Samuel Adams and Dr. Franklin ; but there 
is no apparent reason why Thomas Paine should be 
bisected, especially as he did not appear on the scene 
until 1774. Professor Tyler still treats the Loyalists 
liberally, both in space and judgment. We miss the 
compendious statement of his view of the Revolu- 
tion, which we did not find in the first volume, and 
which we hoped to find in the present one. We still 
regard its absence as a defect in the work. While 
the new volume is inferior in interest, as a whole, to 
the first one, it still deals with some of the foremost 
writers of the time, as Samuel Adams, Dr. Franklin, 
John Dickinson, Thomas Paine, and others. The 
chapter on Franklin is particularly satisfactory. 
The author discovers a likeness between the Amer- 
ican philosopher and Socrates, which he insists is 
more than superficial. " Besides the plebeian origin 
of both, and some trace of plebeian manners which 
clung to both, and the strain of animal coarseness 
from which neither was ever entirely purified, they 
both had an amazing insight into human nature in 
all its grades and phases, they were both indifferent 
to literary fame, they were both humorists, they 
both applied their great intellectual gifts in a dis- 
ciplinary but genial way to the improvement of their 
fellow-men, and in dealing controversially with the 
opinions of others they both understood and prac- 
ticed the strategy of coolness, playfulness, an unas- 
suming manner, moderation of statement, the log- 
ical parallel, and irony." The carefully prepared 
bibliography found in the present volume fills fifty- 
five pages and contains six hundred titles. It is 
intended to be exhaustive of the printed materials 
cited in the course of the whole work. There is 
also a good index, while the mechanical execution 
of the two volumes is worthy of the scholarship and 
literary merit of their contents. 

The second volume of Mr. W. J.Court- 
oetry and h > g History of English Poetry " 

houht. *" * j t 

(Macmillan) covers the period from 
Wyatt to Marlowe. It deepens the impression 
made by the earlier volume, for it is equally a 
work of much industry, learning, and philosophical 
grasp. In his endeavor " to trace the course of 
our Poetry rather by the stream of the national 
thought and imagination than by that of the 
national language," the author has dragged in a 
great deal of matter that seems at first sight en- 
tirely extraneous, and that even reflection cannot 
force into any very direct relation with literary his- 
tory. Before taking up the thread of the history 
proper, it is found necessary to discuss such subjects 



English thought.

[Oct. 16, 



as the Diet of Augsburg, the decay of chivalry, the 
" Prince " of Machiavelli, and the " Colloquies " of 
Erasmus. These matters, and the extensive quo- 
tations everywhere introduced, make a very stout 
volume, although a period of only about seventy- 
five years is covered. Upon such a scale as this, 
the work should require eight or ten more volumes 
for its completion. We regret to say that Mr. 
Courthope is more solid than readable. Whether 
it be from native defect, or from professionalism 
prepense, his work is lacking in animation, and re- 
mains, for the most part, upon a rather low level of 
expression. Occasionally, however, the reader is 
rewarded by such a bit of impassioned rhetoric as 
we find in the following noble passage : " The his- 
tory of ideas has in it something of the solemnity 
of tragic action. As the chant of the monks on the 
Capitol called up in the imagination of the historian 
the long drama of the Decline and Fall of the 
Roman Empire, so the monuments of architecture, 
painting, sculpture, and poetry record the dynastic 
revolutions in the march of human thought. Hu- 
miliating in many respects to our pride is the scene 
of waste, change, and decay that such a retrospect 
discloses. Conceits and affectations elevated into 
the chief aims of poetry ; the idols of beauty con- 
founded with its true forms ; experiments in lan- 
guage conducted at the expense of thought ; vain 
though noble attempts made to reanimate exhausted 
ideals ; admiration lavished on the shadows rather 
than the substance of art such are the ruins that 
will encounter us in this period of our history, like 
the fallen temples, tombs, and aqueducts that sad- 
den the memories of the traveller in the Roman 
Campagna." 

The literature of criminology rap- 

Studies of crime .11 . i..i i 11 c 

and criminal*. ldl 7 increases. A little book before 
us, "Crime and Criminals," by Dr. 
J. Sanderson Christison (Chicago : W. T. Keener 
Co.), is composed, as we are told in the preface, 
largely of a series of articles contributed to the 
"Chicago Tribune" under the caption of "Jail 
Types." The literary style of the book is that of 
the daily newspaper. The author's design seems 
to be to present the criminal in the light of study 
and modern science. A number of cases, repre- 
senting a wide range of criminal types, are briefly 
described and illustrated by portraits reproduced 
from photographs. It is frequently assumed that 
the reader is fully informed regarding the crime 
and criminal discussed, and thus the description 
given is too incomplete and scrappy to be of value. 
The author's wording is often obscure and some- 
times incorrect. It is not clear that he plainly un- 
derstands the use of the words so fundamental 
heredity, degeneration, environment. It is certain 
that he does not understand the use of the word 
specie. The real value of the book lies in the 
fact that it presents cases of Chicago criminals, of 
many or most of whom the local public has heard. 
A scientific verdict upon these cases cannot fail to 



be suggestive to thinking men. Dr. Christison has 
apparently collected a good deal of material ; it is 
a pity that he has not more carefully presented it. 
Apart from the portraits, the illustrations in the 
book have no great value. Thus, the plates of jaw 
forms recognized by Dr. Talbot, of brains brutes, 
normal human beings, and criminals and of the 
degenerate ear, would have value if they had been 
adequately discussed and described. Readers are 
of two classes : they are beginners who need first 
principles, or more advanced students who have al- 
ready gained them. To the former these plates are 
worthless because not discussed ; to the latter they 
are unnecessary because already known. 

According to Mr. Charles Dudley 
* Warner, more insight into Shakes- 

peare's plays is to be gained by 
studying the England of Shakespeare's day than 
from the whole race of commentators and critics of 
the text. In the light of contemporary English life, 
its visions of empire, its spirit of adventure, its 
piracy, exploration, and warlike turmoil, its credu- 
lity and superstitions, its wonder at natural phe- 
nomena, its implicit belief in the supernatural, its 
faith, its daring, its coarseness of speech, bluntness 
of manner, luxury of apparel, and ostentation of 
wealth, the mobility of its shifting society, in such 
a light the dramas glow with a new meaning, and 
awaken a profounder admiration of the poet's 
knowledge of human life. To these matters, there- 
fore, Mr. Warner devotes his little book on " The 
People for Whom Shakespeare Wrote" (Harper). 
His authorities are such old and not commonly 
available writers as Harrison, Stubbes, Stowe, and 
Holinshed ; and it must be granted that he has used 
their musty pages to great advantage in making his 
breezy and picturesque summary. The reproduc- 
tions of such quaint old pictures as " A Puritan 
Family," "A Supper Party," "A Family Group," 
and " William Kemp Dancing " add not a little to 
the charm of the narrative. A drawing of the 
Swan Theatre, made in 1596, gives one an exact 
idea of the places where our ancestors contrived to 
spend so much of their time, on various pretexts. 
Not only was it their resort for pleasure, but also 
their resource in sorrow. As the Italians sleep 
away grief, the French sing, and the Germans 
drink, so the English of the sixteenth century went 
to plays to be rid of it. If only this play-going 
crowd had had the foresight to leave us some au- 
thentic account of their greatest playwright, how 
much guess-work we should have been spared ! 

The right kind of Miss Margaret Warner Morley has 
Nature-studies presented to child-students some de- 
for children. Hghtful studies of " A Few Familiar 

Flowers " (Ginn). There are only five of the flow- 
ers the morning-glory, jewel weed, nasturtium, 
geranium, and hyacinth. We all presume that we 
have known these everyday flowers for a lifetime. 
Many of us have gone through the botanies in our

school-days and analyzed hundreds of wild flowers, 
dried them perhaps, and mounted them in the 
herbarium. Yet there are curious facts in the 
structure of these " familiar flowers " culled by Miss 
Morley which few of us have ever dreamed of. 
She takes her little people to the spot where the 
flower grows, and teaches them how to look at it, 
how to view it in all its aspects, and how to search 
for the meaning and the cause of each peculiarity. 
When they have finished their study, they know 
their plant in every external feature ; and, more 
than that, they have acquired the art of clear and 
accurate observation. Miss Morley has a charming 
gift for talking with children, in language apt and 
elegant, yet simple and natural as that of the child 
she addresses. In " Flowers and Their Friends " 
(Ginn) Miss Morley continues the study of plant- 
life along the same lines pursued in the work above 
mentioned. The same flowers are treated, with 
added information regarding their peculiar features. 
In a second division of the book, under the head of 
" Stories about all Sorts of Things," a simple ac- 
count is given of the structure and uses of cells, 
pollen, nectar, and other vital parts of the flower. 
In all Miss Morley's books the illustrations are a 
notable attraction, the graceful way in which they 
are thrown around and across the text arresting the 
eye with pleasing effects. 

When two writers of marked ability 

in both to 6 *" and natural his- 
tory unite to produce a work giving 
scope to their special talents, the public has reason 
to expect a masterpiece of its kind. In the " Citi- 
zen Bird" (Macmillan), by Mrs. Mabel Osgood 
Wright and Dr. Elliott Coues, this expectation is real- 
ized. Seldom is the plan of a book so admirably 
conceived and in every detail so excellently ful- 
filled. The volume is designed to win young 
people to a love of the birds, and presents its mat- 
ter in the form of a story, which from beginning to 
end never falters in interest. One knows not 
whether most to applaud the ingenuity manifest in 
the varied scenes, the wit that enlivens them all, or 
the enticing manner in which information of a 
solid character is inserted in the narrative. Over 
a hundred birds are introduced, and their portraits 
are given in black and white by Mr. Louis Agassiz 
Fuertes, a young artist whose original and striking 
transcripts of bird-life are exciting mingled wonder 
and delight among ornithologists. 



The Spanish 
Mission* of 
California. 



Catching a glimpse of a book with 
the title " The Missions of California : 
Their Establishment, Progress, and 
Decay" (William Doxey, San Francisco), the re- 
viewer who knows anything of the possibilities of 
that subject is apt to drop everything else and reach 
out after that book, with the thought that the one 
long waited for has come at last. For full justice 
has never yet been done to the religious settlements 
along the Pacific coast, which colonized and evan- 



gelized that portion of our land while furnishing a 
barrier to the inroads of foreigners from the west, 
and which grafted some Spanish institutions upon 
our Anglo-Saxon civilization. The author of the 
small book before us, Miss Laura Bride Powers, 
had access to the materials for such a history, 
"manuscripts, including diaries, mission registers, 
and personal letters "; and there can be no doubt 
of her sympathy with the subject a sympathy 
rising, in fact, to an enthusiasm. We are debarred 
from feeling disappointment that she has not given 
us just the book we want, by her motives in writing 
what she has written. This book " might well have 
gone forth to its destiny known as ' A Plea for the 
Missions, 1 " so says the preface ; and the author lias 
told the tale of their ascendancy and ruin, " hoping 
thereby to enlist sympathy in the cause of their 
restoration and preservation." The book contains 
very brief accounts of the several Missions, is beau- 
tifully printed, admirably illustrated with half-tone 
views, and is appropriately bound ; and we hope it 
may result, as its author so fondly trusts, in awaken- 
ing an increased interest in those monuments along 
our western coast that mark one of the most pictur- 
esque phases of the colonization of our land. 

The study of "English Lyric Poetry, 1500-1700," 
English lyric edited by Dr. Frederick Ives Car- 
P etr y- penter, is the latest volume in the 
"Warwick Library" (Scribner), and the only vol- 
ume thus far contributed to the series by an Amer- 
ican scholar. Dr. Carpenter's introduction of nearly 
fifty pages traces the development of the English 
lyric from the earliest times to the close of the 
Restoration period, and is a study both subtle and 
scholarly. The selections, which run from Skelton 
to Dryden, are made with unfailing taste ; the edi- 
tor has ransacked the abundant modern literature 
of the subject, and set side by side with the familiar 
songs many unfamiliar but almost equally beautiful 
pieces. We can never agree with him in attributing 
" Roses, their sharp spines being gone" to Fletcher, 
but this is our only quarrel with an editor whose 
taste and whose thorough knowledge of the subject 
alike command respect. Dr. Carpenter has also 
published, at the University of Chicago Press, an 
"Outline Guide to the Study of English Lyric 
Poetry," which every teacher of English literature 
will be glad to have. It covers the entire history 
of the subject, and provides thousands of references 
for the student, besides a helpful body of sugges- 
tions for the use of the instructor. Dr. Carpenter 
has made the subject of the English lyric peculiarly 
his own, and his work is a distinct credit to Ameri- 
can scholarship.

scholars have contributed so much to our knowl-

would seem, in this instance, to indicate ignorance 
of the principal authorities on the subject of the 
essay. The many and accurate references to Latin, 
French, and English authorities show, however, that 
the author has written with scholarly care. A fine 
presentation of conditions existing in Rome and in 
Carthage, just previous to Hannibal's campaigns, 
is followed by a clear account of the various battles 
and military movements, so far as it is possible to 
know them. The author's language is well chosen, 
and were it not for the repetition of certain forms 
of expression the descriptive bits of writing would 
be very good reading. The book has a good index

Classes," by Mr. C. G. Knott, is published by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. It is a stout volume of three hundred 
and fifty pages. A book that is elementary in a far 
more literal sense is Mr. C. L. Harrington's " Physics 
for Grammar Schools," issued by the American Book 
Co. In this connection we may also mention Professor 
A. E. Dolbear's "Modes of Motion," published by 
Messrs. Lee & Shepard, and the " Elements of Chem- 
istry," by Mr. Rufus P. Williams, published by Messrs. 
Ginn & Co. 

" A First Book in Writing English " (Macmillan), by 
Dr. Edwin Herbert Lewis, is an elementary text-book 
of rhetoric and composition, the direct outcome of prac- 
tical teaching in the class-room. The author states that 
he has "tried to present a large number of definite 
situations to be faced for constructive practice both in 
organization and in diction ; and to give in simple, even 
colloquial language, all the larger generalizations which 
a boy presenting himself at college might reasonably be 
expected to have been using for two or three years as 
touchstones of his own work." The book is one of the 
best for high-school use that we have seen, clear in its 
statements, logical in its arrangement of material, and 
provided with great numbers of practical exercises and 
apt illustrative quotations. 

" The Age of Milton," by the Rev. J. Howard B. 
Masterman (Macmillan), is the fourth volume thus far 
published in the series of " Handbooks of English Lit- 
erature " edited by Professor J. W. Hales. The period 
covered is that from 1632 to the Restoration, although 
in the case of a few writers the history is projected into 
the period already covered by Dr. Garnett's " Age of 
Dryden." Milton alone fills about one-third of the 
book, Browne and Fuller being the only other writers to 
have whole chapters to themselves. 



LITERARY NOTES. 



Moser's " Der Bibliothekar," edited by Professor B. 
W. Wells, is published by Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. 

Messrs. Truslove and Comba, of New York, publish 
a " Compendium of Italian Pronunciation," by Mr. T. E. 
Comba. 

M. Zola's " Lourdes " is issued by the Maemillan Co. 
in a neat two-volume edition, uniform with the author's 
Rome." 

A second edition, considerably enlarged, of " Chris- 
tianity and Idealism," by Dr. John Watson, of Kingston, 
Canada, is published by the Macmillan Co. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers publish a new edition of 
" Georgia Scenes," by " a native Georgian," a work that 
made its first appearance as long ago as 1840.

Crowell & Co.

published by the American Book Co?, and completes 
the course in French prepared by the author for pre- 
paratory school use. 

The latest of Mr. G. P. Humphrey's " American 
Colonial Tracts " is a reprint of " Nova Britannia," 
dated 1609, and "offering most excellent fruits by 
planting in Virginia." 

Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co. are the publishers 
of " Maude," a juvenile production of that precocious 
child of genius, Christina Rossetti. It was written in 
1850, before the author was twenty years of age. 

Mr. S. E. Cassino, of Boston, is to publish " Little 
Folks," a new magazine for children. Mr. and Mrs. 
Charles Stuart Pratt are to be the editors, and the 
periodical will make its first appearance some time 
during this month. 

" The Librarian of the Sunday School," by Miss 
Elizabeth Louise Foote (Eaton & Mains) is a small 
manual of library practice as it relates to Sunday-school 
work, and may be commended as both sensible and 
helpful in its suggestions. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. have published a hand- 
some library edition of "John Halifax, Gentleman," 
with illustrations by Miss Alice Barber Stephens, at a 
moderate price. The book would make an appropriate 
and inexpensive holiday gift. 

Recent text-books published by the Macmillan Co. 
are a " French Practical Course," by M. Jules Magne- 
nat; an " Analytic Geometry for Technical Schools and 
Colleges," by Mr. P. A. Lambert; and the "Outlines 
of Elementary Economics," by Mr. Herbert J. Daven- 
port. 

Messrs. Maynard, Merrill & Co. publish " The Young 
American," a " civic reader," by Professor Harry Pratt 
Judson. It is an elementary survey of American his- 
tory and politics, interspersed with selections in verse 
and prose, and illustrated with a number of gaudy 
colored plates. The same publishers send us a volume 



1897.]

University; " The Second Book of Caesar's Gallic War,"

Their Friends," a book for children, by Miss Margaret 
W. Morley. 

One of the most interesting of the lists of autumn 
announcements sent out by the English publishers is 
that of Mr. T. Fisher Unwin of London. In addition 
to the many books on his list that will be re-published

228 THE DIAL [Oct. 16, 



THIS WEEK ANNOUNCES THE A NEW NOVEL 

EDWARD ARNOLD PUBLICATION OF By H. Q. WELLS 



THE INVISIBLE MAN By H. G. WELLS, author of "The Time Machine," "Thirty Strange Stories," 
etc. 12mo, cloth. Price, $1.25. 

Mr. Wells has done no better work than this. In its conception the story is original to the verge of boldness. Yet 
so secure is the author in his knowledge of the possibilities of science, and so nice his skill in marshalling the facts in 
evidence, that he has achieved a triumph in making the impossible not only probable but convincingly real. It is a 
book of profound human interest, and not the least of its charms is its humor. 



Also a new novel by GEANT ALLEN: 

AN AFRICAN MILLIONAIRE (6000 already sold in England.) By GRANT ALLEN, author of 
" A Woman Who Did," etc. Cloth, handsomely illustrated, large 12mo. Price, $1.50. 



OLD ENGLISH GLASSES An Account of Glass Drinking- Vessels in England from Early Times to 
the End of the Eighteenth Century. With Introductory Notices of Continental Glasses during the same Period, 
Original Documents, etc. By ALBERT HARTSHORNE, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Illustrated by nearly 
seventy full-page tinted or colored plates in the best style of lithography, and several hundred outline illustrations in 
the text. Super royal 4to. Price, $25.00. 



RECOLLECTIONS OF AUBREY DE VERB In one volume, with portrait. 8vo. Price, $4.00. 

It is not often that we have the privilege of publishing the reminiscences of a man who, a distinguished poet him- 
self, can look back upon a personal acquaintance with Wordsworth. Mr. Aubrey de Vere was born and bred in a 
literary atmosphere, and has known nearly all the greatest thinkers and writers of our time, not merely from casual 
meetings in society, but as friends enjoying a sympathetic communion of intellectual tastes. But Mr. de Vere's 
reminiscences are not confined to literary circles. As a Catholic he was on terms of intimacy with Cardinal Newman 
and Cardinal Manning. As an Irishman he witnessed many exciting political changes, and has numerous anecdotes 
and good stories to tell, pervaded with the racy humor characteristic of the country. 



A new, revised, and cheaper edition of a famous work: 

FIRE AND SWORD IN THE SUDAN By SLATIN PASHA. Translated and edited by Colonel 
WINGATE, C.B., Chief of the Intelligence Department, Egyptian Army. Illustrated. Price, 82.00.

" Robert Louis Stevenson," etc. One volume. Crown 8vo. Price, $1.50. 



"A JUVENILE GIBBON": 

ROME : THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD By ALICE GARDNER, Lecturer in History at Newnham 
College ; author of " Friends of the Olden Time," etc. With illustrations and map. Crown 8vo. Price, $1.25. 



PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS A Text- Book for the use of Teachers and Students in Normal 
Schools, Colleges, and Universities. By C. LLOYD MORGAN, Lowell Lecturer 1895-1896, etc.; author of " Animal Life 
and Intelligence," "The Springs of Conduct," etc. 12mo, cloth. Price, $1.25 net. 

This book has been adopted by most of the schools of pedagogy throughout the United States. 



EDWARD ARNOLD - PUBLISHER - 70 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK

::;::;: LITE RAT u RE JiS J 

c/7 Weekly Gazette of 
LITERARY CRITICISM, COMMENT, AND CHRONICLE. 

Price: 10 cents a copy, $4.00 a year. 

THE admirable distinctness and singleness of purpose that mark this new periodical find 
expression in its title. Literature, and literature alone, is to be its theme. The aim of its 
publishers will be to make it essentially the organ of the literary classes in the widest sense 
of the term, impartial and authoritative in its literary criticism, and a comprehensive and trust- 
worthy medium of literary intelligence. An earnest and an honest attempt will be made to deal 
with the best literature of every country on its literary merits alone, without prejudice, without 
national prepossessions. To English and to American works a certain prominence will almost inevi- 
tably be given ; but this natural preference will not exclude reviews of the more important of the 
volumes issuing from the publishing centres on the continent of Europe. 

Though Literature will consist mainly of reviews of books, it will invite correspondence on and 
will itself deal with any literary subject of permanent or of current interest to the writing, publish- 
ing, or reading world. The rule of anonymity will be generally observed in its reviews, though not 
with unvarying strictness ; and a refreshing novelty is suggested in the statement that every 
endeavor will be made to find room for the proper expression of adverse views over the signature of 
any correspondent. It is proposed to publish weekly, or as often as the occasion may arise, a bibliog- 
raphy of some topic of the time, in order to furnish the reader with a list of all the works which 
can be consulted on the subject. The record of new publications will be made as complete as 
possible, but in the selection of books for review the editor will be guided solely by his judgment of 
their literary value. This seems to be, or should seem to be, a matter of course, but, in point of 
fact, it is a noteworthy innovation, for the practice of indiscriminately reviewing, or, at any rate, 
noticing, every book which issues from the press is one which, by the stimulus it affoids to the pro- 
duction of worthless work, is tending seriously to the degradation of literary standards and to the 
confusion and disgust of readers. Instead of giving to books which are unworthy of any notice at 
all the help of even a scathing criticism, Literature will apply to them the far more effective treat- 
ment of neglect. On the other hand, it is hoped that every important work may be reviewed within 
three weeks after its publication. 

Evidently Literature, by virtue of its definite and undeviating aim, has a field all its own a 
very useful arid a liberal field to work in and to prosper in. And not less evidently it has that 
indispensable thing the positive character which appears to be a prime condition of success in the 
equipment of a publication not less, or scarcely less, than in the career of an individual. 

The selection of Mr. H. D. TKAILL as editor of Literature finds its warrant in the broad critical 
faculty and masculine sanity of judgment which characterize that well-known writer. 

Mr. BARRETT WENDELL, Assistant Professor of English at Harvard College, will contribute a 
weekly letter upon topics of literary interest in America.

The General's Double. 

By Captain CHARLES KING, U.S.A., author of " Captain Blake," etc. With illustrations by 
J. STEEPLE DAVIS. 12 mo, cloth, 81.25. 

For several years Captain King has written no long story. His readers will therefore greet with especial 
welcome this important novel of kindred length and interest with " A Colonel's Daughter " and " Marion's Faith." 

King Washington. 

A Romance of the Hudson. By ADELAIDE SKEEL and WILLIAM H. BKEARLET. 12 mo, 

cloth, $1.25. 

Washington is at the present time the foremost figure in literary interest; as Napoleon was a year or two 
ago. Two startling incidents ia his career enter into the plot of this story, which is, at the same time, a charming 
love-tale. 

The Hermit of Nottingham. 

A Novel. By CHARLES CONRAD ABBOTT, author of " A Colonial Wooing," etc. 12mo, buck- 
ram, ornamental, $1.25.

Portrait. Binding by the Author. Imperial 8vo, cloth

As the title indicates, this volume is not

tastes of English-speaking peoples during the

8vo. Price, $5.00. 

Mr. McCarthy's long experience in the House 
of Commons and his researches preparatory to 
writing his " History of Our Own Times " have 
given him an amount of knowledge, first hand

the development of intelligence and the sense of civic responsibility. 



The Old Santa Fe Trail. 

The History of a Great Highway.

With a Map of the Trail, and eight full-page 
photogravures of Illustrations by Frederic 
Remington, and other illustrations in the form 
of initials and tail-pieces. Portraits of Kit 
Carson and other famous plainsmen. 

The work is full of action from the start, for 
almost from the time Coronado with his Span- 
iards discovered it, it has been a frequently 
travelled way, until the railroad following 
almost along its very track destroyed the need 
of it forever. Along it passed, one after the 
other, the mule train, the wagon caravan, the 
troops on their way to Mexico, the scouts and 
guards of emigrant trains, the beaver trapper 
and buffalo hunter ; and from hunter, scout, 
guide, and trapper, Col. Inman has gathered 
of their best and given us in this book.

THE YERKES OBSERVATORY. 

The characteristic ambition of Chicago to do 
whatever it attempts upon a bigger scale than 
it has ever been done before has just been grati- 
fied in a very conspicuous way. That ambition 
has often been ignoble enough as to its aims, 
and accompanied by self-laudation of an amount 
and a quality calculated to excite the derision 
rather than the respect of the outside world. 
When, through the medium of its blatant news- 
paper press or the windy outpourings of its 
public speakers, it has cackled over such things 
as its Great Fire, or the number of square miles 
covered by its territory, or the census of its 
inhabitants, or the millions of its slaughtered 
hogs, its more judicious citizens have hung 
their heads, and felt that such things should 
rather be taken for granted than expressed, and 
that the consciousness of their truth were most 
fitly accompanied by an eloquent silence. But 
when the chorus of self-congratulation has for 
its theme the largest library circulation in the 
world or the most generous American expendi- 
ture for public schools, the richest of university 
endowments or the most magnificent of interna- 
tional exhibitions, something may be pardoned 
the effusiveness which is so eager to proclaim 
these facts to the rest of mankind, and the 
worthiness of the aims thus realized may partly 
justify the spirit in which they are heralded. 
Certainly, if Chicago ever had adequate cause 
for blowing its own trumpet in the old ear- 
piercing fashion, such cause is provided by 
the superb astronomical observatory, equipped 
with the largest refracting telescope thus far 
made, and manned by a corps of the most bril- 
liant investigators in the country, which has 
been given to the University of Chicago by the 
munificence of Mr. Charles T. Yerkes, and 
which was dedicated to the uses of research by 
the elaborate ceremonies of week before last. 
Few such gatherings of distinguished men of 
science as then assembled at Chicago and Lake 
Geneva have ever been brought together in this 
country, and none has ever taken part in the 
inauguration of a more auspicious scientific 
enterprise. 

The great telescope which was the real hero 
of this occasion represents several years of the

most expert mechanical workmanship. At the 
World's Fair of 1893, the giant tube, tempo- 
rarily mounted, was one of the most conspicu- 
ous of the exhibits, while the lenses had already 
been cast and were being ground in the Alvan 
Clark establishment whence have issued most 
of the objectives for the great telescopes of the 
world. During the past two or three years the 
Romanesque observatory with its imposing 
dome, the design of Mr. Henry Ives Cobb, has 
been rearing its massive walls upon the hilly 
shore of the picturesque Wisconsin lake. Sit- 
uated within a two- hours' railway journey from 
the city, the Yerkes Observatory is now an 
integral part of the University of Chicago, and 
has entered upon its career as a factor in as- 
tronomical research. A quarter of a century 
ago, the old Chicago University owned the 
largest telescope objective that had then been 
produced the eighteen and one-half inch 
Clark lens of the Dearborn Observatory. Since 
then, the scale of achievement in this delicate 
field of the art mechanical has risen, almost 
inch by inch, until a new landmark of progress 
has been set by the clear forty inches of aper- 
ture disclosed by the new instrument. As com- 
pared with the thirty-six inch lens of the Lick 
instrument, the Yerkes telescope has a light- 
gathering power nearly twenty-five per cent 
greater, while the astronomers in charge make 
the gratifying statement that the site proves 
better than had been anticipated. This highly 
important consideration is stated by President 
Harper in the following terms : 

" The atmospheric conditions at night are frequently 
very fine indeed. The best seeing here is not surpassed 
by the best seeing at the Lick Observatory, though in 
the course of a year there would be more good nights 
at Mount Hamilton. The atmospheric conditions dur- 
ing the day are much superior to those of the Lick 
Observatory. The conditions for solar work, consider- 
ing both instruments and atmosphere, are probably 
much better than those enjoyed by any other observa- 
tory." 

At the new observatory, then, all the essen- 
tial conditions for investigation of the most 
fruitful kind seem to be met. But the wonder- 
loving public cannot be too frequently warned 
that no discoveries of a sensational character 
are to be expected even from such an astro- 
nomical equipment as that now provided. Ele- 
phants in the moon will be seen in the future, 
as in the past, by the eyes of humorous poets 
alone, and the doings of the Martians will still 
remain to be chronicled exclusively by the ro- 
mancers. As a member of the staff remarked 
the other day, science does not take kindly to 



that sort of thing. What the observatory shall 
accomplish will fall within certain well-defined 
lines of research, and its work will be uninspir- 
ing save to those in close touch with the pro- 
gress of astronomical science. There will be 
many additions to the catalogue of double stars, 
many new companions of familiar luminaries 
detected, many delicate micrometrical measure- 
ments recorded, and many spectra photographed 
for examination. It is possible that one or two 
new satellites may be found somewhere at the 
outposts of our planetary system, that certain 
vexatious problems of rotation may be solved, 
and that we may considerably increase our 
knowledge of the sun's physical constitution. 
The accumulation of these kinds of facts does 
not appeal to the popular imagination, but, on 
the other hand, such facts appeal with the 
greatest force to the trained astronomer, be- 
cause it is by their means that he hopes, at 
some time in the dim future, to arrive at some 
sort of solution of the vastest of all scientific 
problems that of the constitution of the 
physical universe. 

Truth is, that the real astronomy of to-day 
is so unlike the notion of astronomy as it exists 
in the popular consciousness that the layman 
and the professional hardly speak the same 
language, and that conversation between them 
upon the subject is largely a game of cross- 
purposes. The older astronomy, as popular- 
ized by such men as Mitchell and Proctor, is 
well-nigh a closed chapter in the history of the 
science, and with it the modern observatory has 
little concern. In the old observatory the tele- 
scope was everything ; in the new, the spectro- 
scope and the photographic camera are at least 
its rivals. But it was the old astronomy that 
made possible the new, and that in more ways 
than the obvious one of providing the science 
with its framework of gross facts. The appeal 
of the old astronomy to the popular imagina- 
tion was, and continues to be, very great, and 
it is precisely through the force of that appeal 
that national observatories have been estab- 
lished and private endowments like that which 
now engages our attention have been made. 
In this respect, indeed, astronomy has been the 
favored child in the household of the sciences. 
And if its returns to knowledge have not been 
in the kind for which its benefactors have 
vaguely hoped, they have been of a value far 
exceeding anything that could have been antici- 
pated a generation ago.

Simon Newcomb closed the ceremonies of the

week devoted to the dedication of the Yerkes 
Observatory, he said, among other things : 

" Gentlemen of the trustees, allow me to commend 
to your fostering care the men at the end of the tele- 
scope. The constitution of the astronomer shows curious 
and interesting features. If he is destined to advance 
the science of works of real genius he must, like the 
poet, be born, not made. The born astronomer, when 
placed in command of a telescope, goes about using it 
as naturally and effectively as the babe avails itself of 
its mother's breast. He sees intuitively what less gifted 
men have to learn by long study and tedious experi- 
ment. He is moved to celestial knowledge by a passion 
which dominates his nature. He can no more avoid 
doing astronomical work, whether in the line of obser- 
vations or research, than the poet can chain his Pegasus 
to earth. I do not mean by this that education and 
training will be of no use to him. They will certainly 
accelerate his early progress. If he is to become great 
on the mathematical side, not only must his genius 
have a bend in that direction, but he must have the 
means of pursuing his studies. And yet I have seen so 
many failures of men who had the best instruction, and 
so many successes of men who scarcely learned anything 
of their teachers, that I sometimes ask whether the 
great American celestial mechanician of the twentieth 
century will be a graduate of a university or of the 
backwoods." 

These remarks have a peculiar fitness upon the 
present occasion, for the three men at the head 
of the new observatory are born astronomers, 
if such there ever were. Professor Barnard, 
when at Mount Hamilton, showed how " natur- 
ally and effectively " he could use a great tele- 
scope, and his discovery of the fifth satellite of 
Jupiter made his fame secure for the coming 
centuries. Professor Hale was " moved to 
celestial knowledge by a passion which domi- 
nates his nature," for he was hardly more than 
a boy when, in his own private observatory, he 
made discoveries and perfected methods that 
attracted the attention of astrophysicists all 
over the world. And Professor Burn ham is a 
shining example of the " successes of men who 
scarcely learned anything of their teachers," 
for, with no other means of investigation than 
a modest six- inch glass, and no other time than 
the hours left him from his duties as a law 
reporter, he made for himself a score of years 
ago an international reputation in his chosen 
field of work the investigation of double 
stars. The observatory that has at its com- 
mand the services of three such men as these 
may well face the future with hopeful eyes. 
And when to the men the equipment is added, 
the prospects of the institution are indeed en- 
viable, and justify the eagerness with which 
astronomers everywhere are awaiting the re- 
ports that the coming years are to bring from 
the shores of the Wisconsin lake. 



MAGIC LINES. 

Among the uncollected curiosities of our national 
literature might be found a fragment by an un- 
printed poet of our vanished Bohemia. As nearly 
as I can remember, the effusion was as follows : 
"Oh, I'd weave some mystic, magic line of scriven, 
Whose meaning, when unriven, 
Would be like words from Heaven 
A clue to millions driven 
In this tangled maze of woe. 
Ah, would I might do this, before I go ! " 

And a brother Bohemian of Pfaff's exclaimed : 
" Scriven ? What 's scriven ? " I shall not be so 
fastidious as regards my poet's diction, for I hold 
myself indebted to him for a text ; and I think the 
entire race of verse-makers owes him an obligation 
for voicing the pathetic ambition of their guild 
to leave behind at least one " mystic magic " line 
that the world cannot forget, even if its meaning be 
never wholly unriven. 

I wish here to refer briefly to sundry famous 
lines, in our own language chiefly, whose signifi- 
cance to the world at large would seem to transcend 
the author's conscious intention. The poet Camp- 
bell, in a burst of confidential candor, assures us, 
while lauding another art, that 

" 111 can poetry express 
Fall many a tone of thought sublime." 
I am inclined to think he builded better than he 
knew, in making this admission, since in the order 
of verse under consideration there is imparted to 
expressions, apparently simple in themselves, a gla- 
mour as potent, as inexplicable, as that implied by 
him who asks 

" Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star ? " 
There are lines like the one just quoted, whose effect 
is not to be accounted for by any known laws of 
construction. 

Not only does poetry ill express certain tones of 
thought, but in many instances it does not express 
them at all : it merely suggests a state of mind, 
which, on being induced, weaves a sorcerer's web of 
mystery, all the more sensible because it is invisible. 
We are, as it were, spirited away to Milton's realm, 
" Of forests and enchantments drear, 

Where more is meant than meets the ear." 
But the few lines imbued with this ultra significance 
come so seldom in the course of ordinary reading, that 
one would be tempted to attribute them to accident, 
were it not that it is the privilege of poetry to claim 
for itself a scheme of predestination, a true poet 
resenting the mastership of chance as utterly as does 
the theologian. And yet we are in many cases left 
to conjecture whether the author himself was aware 
of the wizard quality of his own work, especially as 
these magic utterances are seldom found ornament- 
ing a production of transcendent merit or one that 
evinces great ambition on the part of the author. 
Such, and thus undistinguished by position, are the 
following " mystic magic lines of scriven ": 
" The desire of the moth for the star, 
Of the night for the morrow." 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



These form part of a fugitive poem which but for 
them would pass unnoticed. Indeed, Shelley may be 
considered the arch-seer of such lyric necromancy, 
and more than once has his muse veiled herself in 
a garment of woven wind, like the lady in " Alastor," 
and more than once hath his Pegasus " trod the dim 
winds." The latter phrase has always seemed to 
me to induce this feeling of glamour, to which all 
Shelley's translucent metaphors, in more or less 
degree, lend themselves. It is as though in some 
other life we should attain to such exquisiteness of 
vision and sensibility, that the air, which to our mortal 
perception is invisible, should be merely " dim." 
Take another instance, the line from Wordsworth: 

" The light that never was on sea or land." 
This collection of words hints to us vaguely of some- 
thing whereof we know but vaguely to wit, genius. 
Yet this beautiful line, which has sunk into the 
hearts of millions, and which is quoted as one of the 
evidences of that factor which it hesitates to define, 
occurs in a sonnet " On a Picture of Peel Castle in 
a Storm," neither the subject, the artist's treat- 
ment, nor the occasion, having been regarded as of 
especial consequence. 

Mr. Swinburne has contributed his quota of magic 
lines ; but they, though just as mysterious as those 
of Shelley, are less veiled in tender imagery. What 
nameless splendors of the illimitable and the un- 
known are conjured up by the opening line of 
" Hesperia ": 

" Out of the golden, remote, wild West, where the sea without 
shore is." 

What sense of the deadly mystery of fate is em- 
bodied in that other line : 

" Who swims in sight of the great ninth wave, which never a 
swimmer shall cross or climb." 

A strong line, even though it were mere words carry- 
ing no clear-cut significance to the mind. Again, 
how rich in mysterious suggestion the passage de- 
scriptive of Proserpina : 

"Pale, beyond porch and portal, 
Crowned with calm leaves she stands." 

After deducting all the influence of alliteration, and 
allowing for the sombre grandeur of movement, how 
much that is wholly inexplicable in magic effect 
remains ! 

Of an order less vast and comprehensive, yet still 
gloomily picturesque, may be cited the lines from 
Campbell : 

"And heard across the wave's tumultuous roar, 
The wolf's long howl from Oonalaska's shore." 

Lockhart says of this couplet, that many of the 
music-lovers of his day were wont to repeat these 
lines often, just to fill the ear with the mere mel- 
ody thereof; but we contend that there is in the 
effect of these verses something more than music, 
something more than picture, some magic of the 
supersense. 

There is now and then found, among the occa- 
sional verse of the day, a stray lyric possessing no 
plan or purpose commensurate with the effect pro- 
duced, which is one of weird fascination. The whole 



poem might be considered as a continuous "magic 
line." One such has become widely known and is fre- 
quently copied, Bourdillon's enchanting fragment, 

"The night has a thousand eyes." 

A yet more eminent example in the same line is 
Tennyson's " Break, break, break "; constructed of 
the commonest words, embodying a common senti- 
ment, all thrown loosely together like the storm- 
tossed rocks the poet describes, yet the total effect 
is one of infinite tenderness and vague regret, a 
very mirage of the soul. There is heard in it the 
wail of the deep sea, such as ages ago Sophocles 
heard in the .ZEgean, and later was heard on Dover 
Beach by Matthew Arnold. 

There are many of us who know nothing of some 
foreign language save one masterly phrase or line 
which filters into our consciousness half unaware, 
and conveys to us some hint of the miracle of Pen- 
tecost (with all reverence be it said) whereby the 
gift of alien tongues avails for a single instance. 
A very scant knowledge of German suffices to fill 
the mind with a sense of weird revery, on reading 
such poems as, say, "The Lorelei" of Heine, or that 
darker measure, " The Erl King " of Goethe. Of 
the latter poem, the force of the last four syl- 
lables, " Das Kind war todt," is as of four magic 
words used as an incantation. It is a trick of some 
German reciters to drop these four words with a 
solemn death-like emphasis ; and this effect was 
more than reproduced by the conjurer's forefinger 
of Rubinstein, in playing the music. Take one 
more instance the sorrowful burden of poor 
Gretchen's lament, " Nimmer mehr.'' The spell of 
immortal melancholy, cast by this haunting refrain, 
meets us again in Shelley's " No more, oh never- 
more ! " in Byron's 

" No more, no more, oh nevermore on me 

The freshness of the heart can fall like dew," 
and again in " The Raven " of Poe. 

Turning to the poetry of the ancients, that classic 
period just preceding the Christian era, we find one of 
the most celebrated passages in all literature the 
reference to Marcellus in the ".3Cneid" of Virgil: 

"Manibus date lilia plenis, 
Purpnreos spargam flores, " 

Wet with the dew of a pitying heaven and a mourn- 
ing maternity, the odor of those purpureos flores has 
passed down the centuries, and the source of its 
weird intoxication has never been divined. But, 
notwithstanding many passages of exquisite beauty, 
the Latin tongue does lend itself rather to the clear- 
cut definiteness of epigram than to lines of illusive 
magic. The Greek, however, abounds in instances 
illustrative of our subject. For nearly thirty cen- 
turies there have dwelt in the minds and hearts of 
men a few lines from the surviving work of Sappho. 
During all those centuries her poetry has been ac- 
cepted without question or comment save of delight 
and wonder. We need only refer to the Hesperus : 
for sweet as is the hour she celebrates, never, in all 
the years since, have the wistful witcheries of sound 
and the yearning penumbra of sight been so brought

home to the sensitive soul. Yet who can say how 
this is accomplished? 

Anyone familiar with the theory of isomeric 
compounds will have noted the extraordinary fact 
that many substances exactly identical in chemical 
composition display, in their effect, results the most 
dissimilar. Take the most exquisite of all perfumes, 
that which has given poetry to Araby the Blest, 
the atar-gul of Turkey : the attar of roses. Careful 
analysis shows this substance to be precisely iden- 
tical with turpentine. The cause of the difference 
in result remains one of the mysteries of science. 
If accounted for at all, it is by methods as fantastic 
as the assumption of unlikeness in the adjustment 
of molecular atoms. Turpentine is one of the 
cheapest and most abundant of substances known 
to the manufacturer, attar of rose one of the most 
costly and difficult to obtain of all merchandise. 
Could some second-sight espy the cause of difference 
between the two substances, the happy discoverer 
would master a transmutation more profitable than 
was ever dreamed of by alembic. And the same 
might be said of word-magic, as compared with mere 

words - S. R. ELLIOTT. 



OUT OF A THOUSAND. 



As at Cremona, home of chorded sound, 
Some master-workman, plying his loved trade, 
When he a thousand violins hath made, 
Makes one that shall be heard the world around: 
Nor knows he how his wonted toil was crowned; 
For if that wizard instrument be weighed, 
By every test of sight and touch assayed 
Not other than its congeners 't is found. 

So is it with the work that thou dost frame, 
O Bard! Among ten thousand fading lines, 
Thou shalt, perchance (but not through studious zeal, 
Nor lust for current praise or future fame) 
Achieve a single peerless verse that shines 
Emblazoned with a translunary seal !

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE CRERAR LIBRARY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As a former resident of Chicago, I desire to express 
my appreciation of your tribute to the Chicago Public 
Library in your issue of October 16. It is eminently 
just and well deserved. 

Your remarks in the same article concerning the 
other libraries of Chicago also seem to me to be most 
discriminating. Your incidental mention, however, of 
the fact that the Crerar Library is now " of interest 
only to students of science " suggests a point in that 
connection that concerns many of your readers and the 
people of Chicago generally. It is that Mr. Crerar 
unquestionably intended that the contents of the library 
should consist mainly and primarily of literature spe- 
cially fitted to create and sustain high moral sentiment 



in the community, to diffuse an atmosphere of refine- 
ment, and to build up character. No intelligent and 
unbiased person reading the provisions of Mr. Crerar's 
will on that point, as on record and published, can escape 
that conclusion. His declarations and directions to that 
effect are clear and unmistakable. 

Now, unless it can be shown that a library of purely 
scientific literature is better calculated than any other 
to impart this moral and aesthetic culture, and build up 
character, it must be acknowledged that to establish 
such a library exclusively on the Crerar foundation 
would be to proceed directly contrary to the require- 
ments of the instrument from which every atom of au- 
thority to act in the matter is derived. No attempt, so 
far as the writer knows, has ever been made to show 
that an exclusively scientific library will in this case best 
accomplish the objects mentioned. Such an attempt 
would be, at least, interesting to observe. 

But, whether such endeavor be made or not, I think 
that most persons who are fitted to judge will continue 
to believe that the proper material with which to pro- 
duce the results desired by Mr. Crerar is literature of 
the highest and best kind; "the best that has been 
thought and said in the world"; such literature as 
refines and elevates the taste, holds lofty ideals before 
the imagination, and fires the heart with high enthu- 
siasms; "the literature of power" rather than the 
" literature of information " which seeks merely to 
communicate bare cold facts. 

May it not be hoped that the trustees of the Crerar 
Library will yet decide to add to the library a good 
proportion of literature of this kind sooner or later ? 

T. V. V. 

Brooklyn, N.Y., October 20, 1897. 

[At the time when the plans of the Crerar Library- 
were under discussion, we were of the opinion 
expressed in the above communication, and urged 
that opinion upon the trustees. But while we con- 
sider their decision to have been an unfortunate 
one, we have no doubt that they acted conscien- 
tiously, taking into account both what they believed 
to be the best interests of the public and what they 
thought were the intentions of the testator. The- 
situation was, moreover, made more complex than 
it would otherwise have been by the existence of 
two other large public libraries, and the consequent 
importance of such a division of the field of activity 
as should reduce duplication and waste of effort to 
a minimum. At any rate the question is no longer 
open for discussion, since the Crerar Library has 
already gone so far in its chosen direction as to make 
reconsideration impossible. EDB. THE DIAL.] 



" ART AND LIFE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Hale touches an all-important question in THE 
DIAL of October 1, but except for the hint in the phrase 
" that literature may be the breath of life to the spirit," 
does not answer it let us hope, because he intends to 
do so elsewhere. 

It will be worth while to turn to page 177 of the same 
number of THE DIAL, and consider these words from 
the pen of Mr. Charles Leonard Moore, making no 
mental change except to amplify the word " think " by 
the phrase "think and absorb": 



242 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



" Man must think, or sink to the level of the animals. . . . 
Granted that the problems that rise about us are insolvable by 
any system of speculation, yet by facing them man will at 
least realize his soul, which by forgetting them will die out of 
him." 

This, when read in the light of Professor L. A. Sher- 
man's definition of literature, " Anything deemed worth 
thinking again, or experiencing again, and preserved, no 
matter how, with such intention or expectation," suggests 
a theory of "the relation of art to life"; for it must 
have been a character so shaped that Ben Jonson had 
in mind when he wrote: 

" I judge him of a rectified spirit, 
By many revolutions of discourse 
(In his bright reason's influence) refined 
From all the tartarous moods of common men ; 
Bearing the nature and similitude 
Of a right heavenly bodie ; most severe 
In fashion and collection of himself e, 
And then as cleare and confident as Jove." 
An old farmer, broken down by rheumatism, once 
said to me: " The only reading a young man needs is 
the reading of his Bible on Sundays, after working hard 
from daybreak to dark six days in the week." Extreme 
and exceptional, no doubt; but the spirit is not. " Faith, 
attainment, realization," or " Success, the measure of 
achievement," these are the cries, according as one 
is exclusively religious or exclusively worldly. Being 
a positive people, we are generally either one or the 
other. The latter position needs no discussion here. 
For an illustration of the former, turn again to the same 
number of THE DIAL, page 187, the last poetical quo- 
tation. Absolute faith being so commonly held up as 
the ideal, it is not strange that things called by other 
names, though they constitute the soul itself, should be 
considered of secondary worth. Not that the quotation 
does not contain a truth; but ninety-nine out of every 
hundred will read into it the moral " Tu volont^ soit 
faite," before, instead of after, " le possible humain,"and 
will rejoice to look down upon " L'Art . . . enrichi de 
ses efforts utiles," in other words, will view with con- 
tempt the bridge that enables them to cross the stream. 
It is equally necessary to accompany the souls of 
former days through The City of Dreadful Night and 
The Realm of Glorious Day; otherwise we may, for 
lack of preparation, be overwhelmed when the shadows 
come, as come they will, or when the horizon is widened 
or narrowed in spite of the inclination. Faith with eyes 
open is to be opposed to faith with eyes closed. What 
else will strengthen us so to do but art, with its moral 
truth and human passion " touched with a certain large- 
ness, sanity, and attraction of form " ? The problem of its 
relation to life disappears when we realize that art is life 
itself, merely concentrated; none the less true because 

" Calm pleasures there abide, majestic pains ; 

. . . more pellucid streams, 
An ampler ether, a diviner air, 
And fields invested with purpureal gleams," 

or because at times it presents 

" Shadows and shoals that edge eternity," 

"Loco d'ogni luce muto, 
Che mngghia come fa mar per tempesta 
Se da contrarii venti e combattuto,"; 

for these things constitute our living, when we look 
beyond the intervening periods of apathy. 

So far as may be, art is the sole substitute for per- 
sonal experience, making up in largeness and depth what 
it lacks in peculiar application. j 1 L. THOMPSON.

RICHARD WAGNER AND THE BAYRETJTH 
IDEA.* 



" With the exception of two or three smaller 
works, every complete and thoroughly trust- 
worthy treatise on Wagner from whatever 
standpoint it may have been written has been 
the work of a non-musician." This quotation 
from the important work which we are about to 
review is the statement of a fact striking in itself, 
and of the deepest significance as regards the 
position of Richard Wagner in the history of cul- 
ture. Its interpretation must be that the art of 
the composer is so great, its bearings upon the 
spiritual life of mankind so varied, that it may 
not be measured or appraised by the technical 
standards of the musician. Exemplifying as it 
does an aesthetic, a philosophical theory, and a 
social ideal of its own, it demands for its compre- 
hension the widest knowledge and the highest 
analytical power. To estimate such a genius 
in the terms of musical art alone is as impos- 
sible as it would be to estimate Shakespeare in 
the terms of stage technology. In other words, 
the intellectual and emotional power of such 
men as Shakespeare and Wagner so transcends 
the limitations of the arts in which they respec- 
tively wrought their creative work that the mere 
study of their technique is relegated to a sub- 
ordinate place, and the real problem presented 
by them is that of an interpretation which shall 
bring their work into relation with the deepest 
currents of human thought and feeling. Fur- 
thermore, if in the consideration of the phe- 
nomenon presented by the life of Wagner the 
critic who is a musician and nothing more must 
stand aside, so also the German has hardly a 
stronger claim upon that great personality than 
has the Frenchman or the Englishman. 

"Shakespeare is not our poet, but the world's," 

says Landor ; and we may likewise say of Wag- 
ner that in his strenuous endeavor to create for 
Germany a strictly national art he builded bet- 
ter than he knew, and that the art which he 
fashioned grew to a thing of beauty world-wide 
in its power, and destined to do as much for 
the spiritual life of other nations as it accom- 
plished for his own. 

It is not surprising, then, that, in the first 
place, the most important books that have been 
written about Wagner have not come from

musicians, and, in the second place, that his 
fellow-countrymen are not the only ones who 
have worthily attempted to portray his life and 
work. Although it has been left for a German, 
Herr Glasenapp, to produce the most minute 
and laborious biography of the composer, it has 
been to a Frenchman, M. Jullien, that we have 
hitherto been indebted for the most attractive 
illustrated work upon Wagner's art ; and it is 
now to an Englishman, Mr. Houston Stewart 
Chamberlain, that our thanks are due for a 
publication even more sumptuous in execution, 
and far more sympathetic and penetrating as a 
work of interpretation and exposition. Mr. 
Chamberlain has long been known as a Wag- 
nerian of the most painstaking accuracy, and 
some such work as the present has been ex- 
pected from him. His little treatise "Das 
Drama Richard Wagner's," published five 
years ago, promised the larger work which has 
now appeared, although it has not taken exactly 
the form then anticipated. What we have is a 
stout quarto of some four hundred pages, orig- 
inally written in German, and translated into 
English, under the author's supervision, by Mr. 
G. Ainslie Hight. Considered mechanically, 
the work, which bears the London imprint of 
the Messrs. Dent, is a beautiful example of 
book-making. The covers, the paper, the pro- 
portions, and the typography, are all in excel- 
lent taste, while the illustrations are simply 
superb. They include, in addition to some- 
thing like a hundred pictures imbedded in the 
text, nearly forty full-page plates. Some of 
these plates are facsimiles of manuscript, but 
most of them are either portraits or reproduc- 
tions of original paintings made for the work 
by Herr Hendrich. There are five of these 
paintings, having for their subjects " Der Flie- 
gende Hollander," " Siegfried und Fafner," 
" Briinnhilde's Rock," "Siegfried's Death," 
and the " Funeral Procession with Siegfried's 
Body." The artist, in Mr. Chamberlain's words, 
41 is one of the few painters whose imagination 
is not misled by the picture on the stage, who 
are able to grasp the central poetic idea, and 
to reproduce it freely in accordance with the 
character of their own art." These statements 
are certainly justified by the character of Herr 
Hendrich's work as is evident enough from 
the monochrome reproductions here given 
and we must add that the designs display imag- 
ination of a very high sort, the " Briinnhilde's 
Rock," for example, which would be utterly 
impossible as a stage picture, being one of the 
most striking things we have ever seen. It 



needs for a text some such verses as may be 
found in Mr. Swinburne's " Ave atque Vale " 

" Her fair vast head, 
The deep division of prodigious breasts, 
The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep, 
The weight of awful tresses that still keep 
The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests 
Where the wet hill-winds weep." 

As for the portraits in this volume, they in- 
clude no less than ten of Wagner himself 
(among them three by Lenbach and the Her- 
komer gouache), and ten of other persons in 
some way associated with the composer. No- 
ticeable among them are Waldmiiller's Beet- 
hoven and Lenbach's Schopenhauer, the latter 
one of the most extraordinary portraits ever 
painted. The reproductions of these works 
are in photogravure and collotype. 

We have now cleared the way for a dis- 
cussion of Mr. Chamberlain's text. What he 
has aimed to do is set forth in the following 
passages, which stand well in the forefront of 
the volume. " Here I have been led, from 
first to last, by the wish to view Wagner from 
within, to represent him and the world as he 
saw them both. ... I have been guided rather 
by a desire to bring the character and whole 
personality of the hero of my book, Richard 
Wagner, gradually nearer to [the reader], than 
by any notion of assisting him to understand 
the dramas, which are much better able to 
speak for themselves." The plan of the book 
is simple and symmetrical. There is a " Gen- 
eral Introduction," and then there are four 
main sections, or chapters, each provided with 
an appendix. These chapters are concerned, 
respectively, with the life of the composer, his 
writings, his music-dramas, and with " the 
Bayreuth idea," which finally united the three 
threads of his career, "the struggle, the thought, 
the art." 

We cannot do better than follow Mr. Cham- 
berlain in the arrangement of his material. His 
biographical chapter aims to present " not as 
many, but as few facts as possible," and thus 
becomes little more than a skeleton life. The 
primary source of information is the body of 
Wagner's own writings, which are made pecu- 
liarly available by his " absolute and uncom- 
promising love of truth." The author lays 
much stress upon this fact. " Nobody can 
doubt the extraordinary tenacity of Wagner's 
memory ; no person competent to form an 
opinion would question his unswerving integ- 
rity." The secondary source of information is 
principally in the testimony of five men : Liszt, 
the loyal champion and friend ; Stein, the

young poet and aesthetic philosopher, whose 
untimely death was a serious loss to German 
literature and thought ; Herr Glasenapp, the 
industrious biographer ; Herr von Wolzogen, 
the devoted commentator ; and Herr Nietzsche, 
who must be judged by his classical " Richard 
Wagner in Bayreuth," which was "written 
shortly before the first signs appeared of the 
fearful malady which shattered this splendid 
intellect," rather than by " the silly pamphlets, 
full of nauseous trivialities, published later," in 
which evidence of the breaking-up of a great 
mind is all too evident. Mr. Chamberlain out- 
lines Wagner's life in about seventy-five pages 
of biography, noting particularly that the scrip- 
tural seventy years of its duration is broken 
into two almost exactly equal parts by the Revo- 
lution of 1849, which made the composer an 
exile, and threw him upon the resources of his 
own spirit. " Outlawed and persecuted, I was 
now bound by no ties to any sort of lie," 
Wagner wrote of this event, which may justly 
be regarded as epochal for his career. The 
other event upon which stress is placed is that 
of Wagner's becoming acquainted with the 
philosophy of Schopenhauer in 1854 for 
nothing less than an event it was, the most 
important of his whole life, thinks Mr. Cham- 
berlain. " He has come to me in my solitude 
like a gift from Heaven," Wagner wrote to 
Liszt, and no account of his intellectual de- 
velopment can ignore the deep influence ex- 
erted upon him by " Die Welt als Wille und 
Vorstellung." In accordance with the author's 
purpose to present only the essential facts, this 
sketch of Wagner's life omits altogether many 
matters that fill a large space in other biog- 
raphies, thus concentrating the attention upon 
what is really significant or decisive in his 
career. 

The chapter devoted to Wagner's writings is 
about one hundred pages in length, discusses 
successively the three topics, politics, philoso- 
phy, and regeneration, and closes with a section 
on " art teaching," which " embraces equally 
all writings and all periods of Wagner's life, 
for with Wagner art is as the sun : from it all 
light is radiated ; round it every star revolves." 
The author rightly conceives that Wagner's 
creative work needs for its comprehension a 
thorough study of his mental make-up as re- 
vealed by his voluminous prose writings, for, 
as Goethe says : 

" Die Kunst bleibt Kunst ! Wer sie nicht durchgedaeht 
Der darf sich keinen Kiinstler nennen." 

Wagner's political ideas were far removed from 



those which men of the world regard as "prac- 
tical." It is true that he took an active part 
in the Revolution of 1849, that he all but re- 
ceived the baptism of fire upon that occasion, 
and that his generous devotion entailed upon 
him many years of exile, with all their attend- 
ant hardships. But he soon reached a stage in 
which politics of the ordinary sort seemed to 
him "quite fruitless," in which he aspired to- 
ward a far more fundamental reconstruction of 
society than was to be accomplished by any sub- 
stitution of one kind of machinery for another. 
Dr. Ibsen's ideas underwent a similar develop- 
ment at about the same age, and he wrote in 
18701 : " Our concepts call for new meanings 
and new explanations. . . . Men still call for 
special revolutions for revolutions in politics, 
in externals. But all that sort of thing is trum- 
pery. It is the human soul that must revolt. 
. . . The state is the curse of the individual. 
How has the strength of Prussia been bought? 
By the sacrifice of the individual to the politi- 
cal and geographical idea. The Kdlner is the 
best soldier. The state must away ! That rev- 
olution shall find me on its side. Undermine 
the conception of the state ; proclaim free will 
and spiritual kinship as the leading elements 
in the final settlement, and we shall be on the 
way to a freedom that will be worth something." 
Taking the term "state" in its modern sense of 
constitutional monarchy, or of democracy sup- 
porting the divine right of majorities to do what 
they please, these words of the great Norwegian 
are the exact embodiment of at least a part of 
Wagner's thought. But the latter still cher- 
ished the notion that the state, in the sense of 
a racial aggregation and an absolute monarchy, 
might prove compatible with the most insistent 
individualism. This paradoxical idea, which 
may also take the reverse form of " free sover- 
eign absolute people," may be taken as the 
kernel of Wagner's speculative thought in the 
political field. Recurring for a moment to the 
comparison with the Norwegian individualist, it 
is instructive to note the later divergence of 
their respective methods. Dr. Ibsen, after 
presenting to the world " Brand " and " Peer 
Gynt," those superb products of the positive 
ethical imagination, declined to the merely neg- 
ative task of putting his finger upon the sore 
places of modern society, and saying : thou ail- 
est here and here. Wagner, on the other hand, 
pursued to the end his passionate positive ideal 
of a society to be regenerated by self-sacrifice 
and sympathy and art, an ideal which united 
in its service the noblest aspirations of both

the religious and the artistic consciousness. 
Still, it must be said of both these men that 
their political ideas were never really thought 
out, that when scrutinized with the lens of 
largest light-gathering capacity they remain in 
considerable part nebulous. 

Wagner's philosophical development offers a 
curiously interesting study. "It is the mark 
of the poet," he says, "to be riper in the inner 
perception of things than in conscious abstract 
knowledge." Kant could not satisfy a nature 
thus constituted, and to it the Hegelian dialectic 
was the abomination of desolation. The phil- 
osophy of the latter " succeeded in making the 
minds of the Germans so completely incapable 
of apprehending the problem of philosophy, 
that ever since it has been considered the only 
true philosophy to have no philosophy at all." 
It was in Feuerbach that Wagner first found 
the help that he needed for the classification of 
his philosophical concepts, but that essentially 
shallow thinker provided only a temporary ref- 
uge for his restless mind. It was Schopenhauer, 
as has already been stated, who removed the 
scales from his eyes, and provided him with a 
philosophy that satisfied the deep inner cravings 
of his nature. We should say that Wagner did 
not assimilate or even understand the whole of 
Schopenhauer's thought, and it is probable 
that the philosopher would have looked much 
askance at the later music-dramas if told that 
they were the outcome and embodiment of his 
theory of art, but his influence upon the com- 
poser remains nevertheless unquestionable. Mr. 
Chamberlain admits that "the personal equation 
may have to be applied," that " between Wagner 
and Schopenhauer were incisive divergences," 
and then goes on to speak as follows : " He who 
builds upon Schopenhauer builds upon a rock ; 
that Wagner clearly saw, and remained true to 
him from 1854 until his death. Feuerbach was 
a passing episode, the last echo of the dumme 
Streiche of the revolution. The acquaintance 
with Schopenhauer 'the most genial of man- 
kind,' as Graf Leo Tolstoi calls him, is the 
most important event in Wagner's whole life. 
Now for the first time his metaphysical yearning 
was provided with an efficient receptacle in this 
all-embracing view of the world ; now at last 
the marvellously ramified elements of his own 
being, as thinker and poet, were united again 
in his breast to a harmonious personality, con- 
scious in every detail the thinker meditated 
more deeply, the artist gained strength, the 
views of the politician became clearer, the 
Christian spirit, that of sympathy, of longing 



for redemption, of steadfastness till death, of 
resignation to the will of a higher Power, re- 
turned to the heart, from which many years be- 
fore had issued 'Tannhauser,' 'Lohengrin,' and 
'Der Hollander.' Over the Meister's work-table 
there hung only the picture of the great seer, 
and in 1868 he wrote to Lenbach, the painter 
of the magnificent portrait : ' I have one hope 
for German culture, that the time will come 
when Schopenhauer will be the law-giver for all 
our thought and cognition.' " Many others be- 
sides Wagner have been similarly influenced by 
Schopenhauer, even while rejecting much of his 
doctrine. The secret of that influence seems 
to be, in the words of Professor Caldwell, the 
philosopher's latest commentator, that he com- 
bined " to a more wonderful extent than any 
other man who ever lived the power for abstract 
speculation with an enormous vitality of force 
and feeling," and that " a clear and pure and 
direct intuition into life, a whole sense for 
reality, always weighed with Schopenhauer far 
more than the greatest power of abstract 
thought." Much the most interesting part of 
Mr. Chamberlain's chapter upon this subject 
is found in the pages which show, by quotations 
from the writings published before Wagner had 
even heard the name of Schopenhauer, how the 
mind of the artist was ripe for contact with the 
thought of the philosopher, how curiously the 
one had anticipated some of the most charac- 
teristic thoughts and expressions that he was 
afterwards to find in the pages of the other. 

Wagner's departure from the teaching of 
the philosopher by whom he was so deeply in- 
fluenced is most distinctly marked in what may 
be called his doctrine of regeneration. It cer- 
tainly gives " a surprising turn " to the phil- 
osophy of Schopenhauer to recommend it as 
the only one from which we may " set out in- 
dependently on the paths of true hope." Yet 
Wagner did nothing less than this, and in a 
very pregnant passage asserts that the Scho- 
penhauerian negation of the will to live, how- 
ever brought about, " must always appear as the 
highest energy of the will itself." It is through 
the influence of art that regeneration must be 
sought; and art then, which Schopenhauer 
thought to offer but a temporary escape from 
the misery of existence, seemed to Wagner to 
promise a way out of pessimism altogether. 
Now regeneration implies degeneration, and 
long before Dr. Nordau's superficial and sen- 
sational discussion of degeneration it had been 
recognized by Wagner in a far deeper sense. 
According to him this is the very beginning of 



246 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



wisdom, for " the will's assurance of victory is 
achieved by the recognition of the decadence." 
The chief causes of this degeneration, which 
Wagner believed to be the condition of all 
modern civilization, are to be found in the in- 
stitution of inherited property, the deteriora- 
tion of blood resulting from animal food, the 
weakening of racial stocks through intermar- 
riage with inferior peoples, and the moral in- 
fluence of Judaism. The statement of this 
latter cause may provoke a smile, but Wagner 
took the subject very seriously, and it may be 
added that the spirit in which he considers it 
is as far removed from the spirit of the Juden- 
Jietze as it is from the spirit of personal jeal- 
ousy by which small minds have sought to 
account for that extraordinary book, " Das 
Judenthum in der Musik." As for the work 
of regeneration, it has three aspects, " the 
empiric and historical, the abstract philosophi- 
cal, and the religious." But it is in art alone 
that these " three worlds become conscious of 
their oneness," for art " possesses the magic 
power of showing man to himself, and herewith 
pointing out the way to regeneration." This 
is a hard saying for those who regard art as an 
elevated form of amusement, or as the provider 
of delicate sensuous gratifications, but it must 
be grasped in its full meaning before anyone 
may hope to penetrate the inner significance of 
the work of Richard Wagner. 

If we have devoted a disproportionate amount 
of attention to the ideas of the composer as 
distinguished from his art-works, it is because 
few, even among the most devoted students of 
his music, know very much about the philo- 
sophical theories upon which that music is 
based, or of the social ideals to which dramatic 
embodiment is given : it must be remembered 
that Wagner was a man of scholarship and 
culture as few, if any, of his predecessors had 
been, and that with him the creative instinct 
was under the most complete control of the in- 
telligence. Mr. Chamberlain's discussion of 
the art-works, therefore, while of great value, 
demands less of our attention than what he has 
to say about their underlying system of thought. 
A few remarks should be made, however, on 
the subject of Wagner's poetic powers. Most 
Wagnerian enthusiasts (and the author offers 
no exception) try to claim for the Master the 
title of poet to a degree unwarranted by the 
facts and unnecessary for his fame. It is mere 
juggling with words to call Wagner a great 
poet simply because he created certain great 
dramatic figures " which belong henceforward 



and for all time as completely and inalienably 
to the living consciousness of the entire human 
race as an Achilleus, an QEdipus, a Hamlet, or 
a Faust." We may admit all this and we 
firmly believe it to be true without thinking 
it necessary to call the creator of these figures 
a great poet. The simple truth is that Wagner 
was enough of a poet for the purposes of the 
complex art for which he stands. It is not the 
greatness of his texts, considered as literature, 
that compels our admiration, but their absolute 
adequacy. Poetry that is great on its own 
account would be out of place in such works as 
" Siegfried " and " Parsifal " because it would 
demand too large a share of the attention. It 
is absolutely necessary that the poetry em- 
ployed for such a purpose should be reduced 
to its lowest terms, so to speak, a fact which 
Wagner's own artistic instincts led him to real- 
ize, but which few of his followers have been 
willing to admit. What Wagner accomplished 
was to fulfil the prophecy of Herder, who 
looked for the advent of the man who should 
" upset the whole abode of scrappy operatic 
sing-song, and erect an Odeum, a complete 
lyric building, in which poetry, music, action, 
and scenery are one." 

The Odeum of this prophecy was erected in 
1876, set upon a hill, and for more than twenty 
years now have pilgrims from all parts of the 
world sought it out. What they have found 
there is more than words have yet availed to 
say. There are thousands of persons now living 
for whom the tone-poems of Wagner have been 
an influence profoundly shaping both thought 
and character, and a century from now they 
will be numbered by hundreds of thousands. 
Yet these very persons, although they know 
what the influence has been, find it utterly in- 
explicable in terms of the intellect. They can 
tell just how and why they have been influenced 
by Plato, or Shakespeare, or Goethe, but they 
cannot thus explain the power of Bach, or 
Beethoven, or Wagner. Mr. Chamberlain 
comes as near as anyone else to offering such 
an explanation, but after all his reasoning, we 
are left with a feeling that the secret is still 
uncommunicated and is probably incommuni- 
cable. Perhaps we may hope to do nothing 
more than take for our final stand the position 
of Schopenhauer, who held that, whereas the 
other arts represent to the intelligence the 
various ideal objectifications of the world-will, 
the art of music is the immediate expression 
of the will itself, and as such incapable of in- 
terpretation because in need of none. The

more deeply we consider the subject, the more 
are we forced to the opinion that all explana- 
tions of the appeal of music to the conscious- 
ness are but rhetorical devices to veil the real 
problem in a network of figurative speech and 
more or less fanciful analogy. ;. .,,

THE VICTORIAN DRAMA.* 

A French writer, M. Augustin Filon, has 
given us a very readable account of the Victo- 
rian drama, with the avowed object of proving 
that there exists at this time a living English 
drama, that is to say, a drama expressing 
" the ideas and passions of the time " and re- 
producing " a complete synthesis of all the 
elements of the national character." Such a 
drama, the author thinks, did not exist thirty 
years ago. Then there were various forces at 
work which prevented it from being developed 
along original lines. Among these forces were 
" the timidity resulting from excessive severity 
of manners," " the dramatist's lack of oppor- 
tunity for the study of social life," and " the 
Shakespeare cult, which paralyzed the imagina- 
tion by offering it a model that was too big for 
it, and forms that had become antiquated." 
One after another these forces have been dis- 
sipated ; and along with them has gone much 
of the English playwrights' dependence on 
French dramatists of the Sardou stamp, a 
dependence which M. Filon confesses was alto- 
gether harmful to the English stage. Now that 
these clouds have blown over, he is of the opinion 
that to-morrow will be even brighter than to- 
day, and in a concluding paragraph he goes so 
far as to suggest the probable trend of the 
present movement. 

" What the English drama is in search of, what it is 
about to create, ... is a new form in which to repro- 
duce that dualism which has struck and disconcerted 
every observer, native or foreign, Matthew Arnold, 
Emerson, Taine. ... A race of heroes who are also 
buccaneers, a race of poets and shopkeepers, a race fear- 
less of death and devoted to money, calculating but 
passionate, dreamers yet men of action, capable of the 
charges of Balaklava and the deal in the Suez shares, 
cannot possibly find its literary expression either in pure 
idealism or in realism undiluted. The 'bleeding slice of 
life ' awakes in it no appetite ; ' Art for art's sake ' 
leaves it wonderfully indifferent; of moralising, it is 
tired for the time being: it is passing through a stage 
of sensuous torpor which is not without charm, and it

Drama. By Augustin Filon. Translated from the French by

waits, open-eyed and, as it were, hesitatingly, before the 
labour of creating society afresh, of building up a new 
civilization. It does not wish, and is not able, to forget 
those problems that terrible To-morrow by which 
we are everywhere threatened. Hence its sensuousness 
is tempered, refined, saddened by philosophy. And in 
this mood, what it asks of the drama is, not to be amused, 
or to be excited, but to be made to think." 

It may be that not all, or even a majority, 
of M. Filon's readers will adopt this thesis, or 
accept the extremely hopeful view he takes of 
the present dramatic movement in England ; 
but none will deny that he has written an en- 
tertaining and instructive account of a literary 
type and period which have heretofore wanted 
an impartial historian. In his treatment of 
this period, M. Filon has attempted to trace 
the origin of the Victorian drama ; he has dis- 
cussed the influences from within and from 
without which have helped to mould and shape 
its course ; and he has analyzed its most rep- 
resentative plays. He has also considered such 
salient features of acting and dramatic criticism 
as seemed most noteworthy. He has thus 
worked out a threefold treatment of a period 
which extends, roughly speaking, all the way 
from Sheridan Knowles to Grundy, Jones, and 
Pinero ; from Edmund Kean to Sir Henry 
Irving ; and from Leigh Hunt to Edmund 
Gosse and William Archer. In this moving 
throng of dramatists, actors, and dramatic 
critics, precedence is always given to the dra 
matist ; and by this means the author has been 
able to secure variety by scattering through his 
pages anecdotes about players, scraps from 
published and unpublished plays, little pastels 
of dramatists living and dead, stray bits of 
reminiscence, and so on, without materially 
marring, in either conception or treatment, the 
essential unity of his work. 

One does not have to go far in this book to 
find pictures which recall vividly old-life scenes. 
One of the best of these is that of the strolling 
player whose custom it was to go on circuit 
through the country towns of England. 

" Just as the English judges make the round at cer- 
tain dates of all the important towns within a certain 
district, holding assizes at each, and accompanied by an 
army of barristers, solicitors, and legal officials of all 
kinds, so the travelling companies of actors would cater 
for a whole county, or group of counties, giving a series 
of performances in the theatre of every town at certain 
fixed dates, in addition to fete-days and market-days. 
Communication was slow and costly in those days, and 
trips to London infinitely rarer than they are now. The 
country folk had to look to their travelling company to 
keep them in touch with the success of the moment. 

" On arriving in a new town, the manager's wife 
would go about soliciting respectfully the patronage of 
the ladies of the place. The manager busied himself

over everything, played minor roles, presided over the 
box-office, undertook the scene painting, and would even 
take off his coat and turn up his sleeves and lend a hand 
to the machinist. His life, and the life of all his com- 
pany, was half bourgois, half Bohemian; always en route, 
but always on the same beat, always coming upon familiar 
and friendly faces, a beat on which his father and 
grandfather before him had followed the same career. 
He had friends living in every city, dead friends in 
every churchyard. Children were born to him on his 
travels, and when four or five years old made their 
appearance upon the stage. These comings and goings, 
the journeyings over green fields, the stoppages and 
ample breakfastings at little hillside inns, while the 
horses browsed at large along the hedges, the fresh- 
ness and peaceful rusticity of all these things, alternating 
with the tinsel of the theatre and the applause of the 
audiences, with the artificiality and feverishness of 
theatrical life, must have been a constant entertain- 
ment to the little actors and actresses of eight or nine. 
For the adults, however, the life was a hard one, and 
only too often their roman comique was a roman tragique 
in reality." 

Here is an account of a pilgrimage which 
M. Filon made to a deserted theatre : 

" I took it into my head not long ago to pay a visit 
to the little theatre in which Fre'de'ric Lemaitre ap- 
peared, in which Napoleon and Count d'Orsay rubbed 
shoulders with Dickens and Thackeray, in which there 
was difficulty once in finding a seat for Gladstone, and 
in which Beaconsfield received a memorable ovation. 
The Salvationists have succeeded to the comedians, and, 
whether or not it be that their trumpets have the virtue 
of those of Jericho, these historic walls are crumbling 
to ruin. The place is empty, cold, and desolate. It 
was on an evening of last winter that I stood pensively 
under the porch the porch through which had flowed 
like a stream all the elegance and talent of a whole 
generation. The light of a gas jet shone mournfully on 
the notice, mouldy already, To be let or sold '; and the 
rain trickled down on me from a gaping hole whence 
the electric light used once to glare upon pretty women 
issuing in all their finery from their carriages." 

As almost two-thirds of M. Filon's book is 
concerned with the generation still living, and 
as contemporary criticism must ever be more 
or less modified by time, many of the individual 
judgments expressed here will not be those of 
twenty-five, or even ten, years hence. Nearness 
to the period criticised has in some cases de- 
prived the author of that independence of judg- 
ment so essential to enduring criticism. An 
example of this is his attempt to compromise 
between the two schools of dramatic criticism 
now at odds in England, an attempt that 
reminds us more than anything else of the 
endeavors of George Eliot's conciliatory land- 
lord in " Silas Marner," or of the worthy old 
umbrella-maker in the double chin whom Irving 
humorously describes in " Little Britain." 
Much of M. Filon's criticism, however, has 
lasting merit ; of this sort is nearly all that he 
has to say of Bulwer Lytton, Irving, Tennyson, 



and Ibsen's influence on the English drama. 
That easy, familiar style, so characteristic of 
French men of letters, has not been lost in the 
translation. And, in concluding, it may be 
added that Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, under the 
guise of introducing M. Filon to his English 
readers, has some good, and many bad, things 
to say about a dramatic movement in which his 
own works have exerted no inconsiderable in- 
fluence. TULEY FRANCIS HUNTINGTON. 



MR. AUBREY DE VERB'S RECOLLECTIONS.* 



In his preface to his " Recollections " Mr. 
De Vere makes a distinction between " Recollec- 
tions " and " Autobiographies." " This book," 
he says, " belongs to the former class, not to 
the latter. We have seen persons and places 
which have amused or interested us, and it 
occurs to us that if accurately described they 
might amuse or interest others also ; but this 
is a very different thing from writing one's 
biography, with which the world has little con- 
cern." The book before us is itself a refuta- 
tion of this modest theory ; with its notable 
men and their own interpretations of their lives 
the world has a large and serious concern, and 
a memory whose limits are practically those of 
the Victorian Era can do us no better service 
than to render up its important and accumu- 
lated treasures. 

We remember the distaste which Hawthorne 
and Tennyson had for biographies, and the 
appalling disclosures which so many writers of 
them have deemed a necessary part of the task 
which had been set for them ; but now that the 
Tennyson memoirs have been written, and we 
have learned from them once more how a bio- 
graphical work should be done, we may con- 
sider ourselves recovered from the dismay with 
which some exemplars filled us. 

Mr. De Vere's Recollections date back to the 
earlier years of the century. In an Irish home 
of wealth and refinement he enjoyed those op- 
portunities which a mind like his needs for the 
due unfolding of its powers. He has, however, 
some curious anecdotes to relate of a grand- 
father who was a typical man of the place and 
period. He was early brought into relation 
with the varied life of the time, and his inter- 
ests always have been far-reaching and many- 
sided. Religion and politics have occupied his 
attention as well as literature, and the struggle

of his country for genuine subsistence and 
recognition has been, as was right, a master 
influence in his career. 

Authors are very apt to narrow their inter- 
ests to the subjects with which they are specially 
occupied. The maker of verses is very prone 
to believe that the production of a new lyric is 
the end toward which the forces of the century 
have been toiling. Literature is no doubt a 
great field which requires assiduous tillage, but 
there are others in which the laborers reap 
abundant harvests and manifold honors. Mr. 
De Vere's intimacies with the important men 
in diverse regions of intellectual activity give 
to his book a value which no merely literary 
preoccupation could possess. The figures that 
cross these pages are as differenced as the labors 
of the period, Wordsworth, Sir William R. 
Hamilton the mathematician, O'Connell, Car- 
dinals Newman and Manning. Some anec- 
dotes of Sir William Rowan Hamilton may be 
repeated here. 

" Sir W. R. Hamilton kept a headstrong horse, to 
which he had given the name of ' Comet,' and used to 
gallop it in circles, or perhaps in ellipses, around the 
lawn. On one occasion he mounted him in Dublin, just 
after a curious mathematical problem had suggested 
itself to him. The horse took a mean advantage of his 
abstraction, and ran away. When I found it impossible 
to stop him,' he said, I gave him his head and returned 
to the problem. He ran for four miles, and stood still 
at my gate just as the problem was solved.' " 

" The Royal Astronomer [Hamilton] did not look 
through his telescope more than once or twice a year! 
He used to say, ' That is my deputy's business. The stars 
move all night; but what interests me is the high 
mathesis that accounts for their movements.' " 

The observation sounds strange in this day of 
the accumulation of data and so-called facts. 

Mr. Aubrey De Vere began to write poetry 
when he was about eighteen years old, although 
without thought of publication. It was to his 
father that he owed his introduction to Words- 
worth, the influence that was to dominate so 
much of his thought and aspiration. 

" I had happened to say to my father, I suppose 
everyone knows that Byron is the greatest modern poet.' 
He answered, very quietly, ' I do not know it.' Then 
who is ? ' He replied, I should say Wordsworth.' 
' And, pray, what are his chief merits ? ' He answered, 
' I should say, majesty and pathos, as for instance in 
" Laodamia." ' I read ' Laodamia ' standing, to the last 
line, and was converted. I seemed to have got upon a 
new and larger planet, with 

' An ampler ether, a diviner air, 
And fields invested with purpureal gleams.' " 

In 1841 our author passed several days under 
Wordsworth's roof, which he considers the 
greatest honor of his life. The old poet took 
him out walking. 



" He showed me the scenes to which he was most 
attached, and recorded many incidents connected with 
them. In the presence of Nature he seemed to be 
always either conversing with her as a friend, and watch- 
ing her changeful moods, or sometimes rapt, like a 
prophet, in mystic attention to her oracles. It was by no 
means the picturesque aspects of Nature which affected 
him most it was something far more serious and 
absorbing. For him it was in her deeper meanings that 
the inspiring influences of Nature chiefly resided. If one 
had demanded of him what were those deeper meanings, 
it would have been as if one had demanded of Beethoven 
what were the deeper meanings of his grandest sym- 
phonies, which are often his obscurest." 

In 1843-4 he travelled in Italy with Sir 
Henry Taylor. The friendship with the author 
of " Philip Van Artevelde " extended over a 
period of forty years. The tribute which he 
pays to Sir Henry Taylor is extreme. It may 
perhaps be said of the Wordsworthians that 
they have dwelt too close to the splendor of 
their chief. The poetry of Sir Henry Taylor, 
and of Mr. De Vere himself, would have had 
better chances of the recognition which was 
undeniably their due if they had moved out of 
the charmed circle in which they seemed con- 
tent to remain. There could be but one Words- 
worth, and emancipation from him was a simple 
necessity. 

While travelling to England in the spring of 
1841, Mr. De Vere met O'Connell. They went 
together from Liverpool to London. The potent 
eye, the large and crafty mouth, the broad 
strong forehead, the confident bearing of the 
" Liberator," made their due impression. As 
was intimated before, what may be called the 
political recollections of the author make a fair 
share of his volume, and the chapters devoted 
to them have a value proportioned to the impor- 
tance of their subjects. There is a long account 
of the great Irish Famine (1846-50), with the 
various forms of attempted amelioration. It is 
a dark interlude in a book which is full of sun- 
shine, simple humor, generous hopefulness of 
all kinds. 

An account of the " Recollections " which 
omitted the reminiscences of Cardinal New- 
man and Cardinal Manning would indeed be 
incomplete. Those portions would no doubt 
be regarded of prime value by the author, and 
in them there is a subdued enthusiasm which 
does not so fully appear elsewhere. Newman 
and Wordsworth are the two men for whom 
Mr. De Vere has the deepest admiration, and 
he has in himself an abundance of the material 
from which hero-worshippers are made. His 
admirations, however, are invariably reasoned 
ones ; they are not expressed without the 



250

grounds on which they are based. Indeed, the 
chapters dealing with Newman and Manning 
are rather portraits than recollections, and have 
the vividness which comes from personal friend- 
ship. It will interest the reader to learn that 
the " Dream of Gerontius " on the information 
of Newman " owed its preservation to an acci- 
dent. Newman had written it on a sudden 
impulse, put it aside, and forgotten it. The 
editor of a magazine wrote to him asking for a 
contribution. He looked into all his pigeon- 
holes, and found nothing theological ; but, in 
answering his correspondent, he added that he 
had come upon some verses, which, if as editor 
he cared to have, were at his command. The 
wise editor did care, and they were published 
at once. I well remember the delight with 
which many of them were read aloud by the 
Bishop of Gibraltar, Dr. Charles Harris, who 
was then on a visit with us, and the ardor with 
which we all shared his enjoyment." 

So these memories take their course, the 
records of a life devoted to noble purposes and 
accomplishing high results. We are admitted 
into intimacy with those who played great parts 
in the drama of Victorian life ; we see them in 
their habit as they moved, and learn much of 
their thought from a listener who was generous 
and sympathetic ; and above all we carry away 
with us a picture of the poet and thinker and 
toiler for whom we can only have much of that 
admiration which he so freely lavishes on 
others. 

The publisher of the work has done his part 
of the task well ; the volume is a pleasure to 
the eye, as its contents are to the mind and 
heart of the reader. Lomg j BLOCK. 



PRINCE BISMARCK AND THE GERMAN 
EMPIRE.* 

In the new volume of his great work on 
" The Founding of the German Empire," Pro- 
fessor von Sybel carries along the story only a 
little more than a year, but it is so important 
a year that it is well worth the careful atten- 
tion that is bestowed upon it. With the vic- 
tory of Prussia over Austria, the exclusion of 
the latter power from the new Germany, and 
the consequent dissolution of the old Confeder- 
ation, a general readjustment of both internal 
and foreign relations was made necessary ; and

IAM I. By Heinrich von Sybel. Volume VI. New York :

this was accomplished during the year 1867. 
A new national spirit had been growing up in 
Germany as in the other parts of Europe dur- 
ing the middle part of the century, had reached 
the stage of enthusiasm in 1848, and after the 
inevitable reaction following that excitement 
had become solidified into a practical working 
principle. Prussia's victory gave it its oppor- 
tunity, and now a real state was to be created 
to replace the shadowy affair that had repre- 
sented German particularism. This same year 
was also a preparation for the struggle that was 
inevitable before a jealous France could be in- 
duced to accept the changes in the map of 
Europe and the fancied humiliation of being 
shoved aside from her position as the self- 
constituted arbiter of Europe. This volume 
describes the irritation in France at Prussia'* 
successes, and the efforts, constantly becoming 
more frantic, to win from Prussia some com- 
pensation for the latter's increase of power that 
would salve the wounded vanity of Frenchmen 
and restore the declining prestige of the Empire ; 
and how each of these efforts was thwarted by 
an outburst of national feeling in Germany and 
by the shrewdness of Bismarck's management. 
But Professor von Sybel shows that Bismarck 
did not thwart poor Napoleon's schemes with 
malignant satisfaction, as many writers have 
declared, but that he was ready to make con- 
cessions that might have prevented the war of 
1870, had he not been held in check by the 
military party or by these patriotic outburst* 
that he did not dare to disregard. The outcome 
of this international game is left for a later 
volume. 

These things, however, are almost incidental 
to the main matter of the volume, which is 
taken up with a description of the political 
struggles incident to the formation of the new 
constitution, and to the establishment of definite 
relations with the South German states. The 
reader is forcibly reminded of the struggles of 
our own Critical Period and the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787. There was the same nar- 
row particularism, the same jealousy of state 
against state, the same unpractical idealism. 
But in the German Reichstag the national 
spirit was reinforced by the overwhelming in- 
fluence of Prussia and her great statesman, by 
the powerful Customs-Union upon which the 
material prosperity of the smaller states de- 
pended, and by the pressure of outside nations. 
On the other hand, German idealism tended 
naturally to increase the difficulty of reaching 
a satisfactory result as against the practical

Anglo-Saxon tendencies of our Fathers. With 
due pressure judiciously applied by Bismarck 
at critical times, a good working constitution 
was framed and promptly ratified. 

The matter of the relations of the South 
German States to the new German nation was 
difficult to handle, but was handled with con- 
summate shrewdness. Their accession to the 
Confederation in time was inevitable, for they 
could not stand alone, they could not go back 
to Austria, and they could not be dependent 
upon France, the German national spirit 
would work out the union in due time. But 
Bismarck recognized that to hurry the process 
would be to retard it, and so, to the astonish- 
ment of the surrounding nations, who could 
hardly understand such self-restraint, he dis- 
couraged all premature attempts to bring them 
in. Their relations to the Confederation were 
fixed on a comfortable working basis, they 
entered the reorganized Customs-Union, they 
bound themselves to the Confederation by close 
alliances, and then were left to themselves. 
Later events showed how thoroughly German 
they were at heart, and how readily they would 
join their northern brothers when a common 
patriotic endeavor should break down the tra- 
ditional barriers between them. 

The author states in his preface that after 
Prince Bismarck's retirement he was refused 
access to the documents of the Foreign Office, 
and for a time gave up his project. But being 
pushed by his publisher to continue the work 
and fulfil his contract, he found that the litera- 
ture already in print, written records made at 
the time, diaries, journals, and correspondence, 
and his own recollections as a leading actor in 
the parliamentary life that he describes, would 
in a measure supply the place of official docu- 
ments. " The documents denied me would 
probably have afforded a greater knowledge 
of detail, but in so far as a correct conception 
of the essential course of events is concerned, 
their place was fully supplied."

WITH the death of Newton Bateman, of Galesburg, an 
interesting figure disappears from educational Illinois. 
Dr. Bateman was for fourteen years superintendent of 
the public schools of the State, and for nearly twenty 
years following was President of Knox College. He 
belonged to the generation of Mann and Barnard, and 
his influence as a public educator was at least compar- 
able with theirs. Of late he has been engaged in editing, 
together with Mr. Paul Selby, a " Historical Encyclo- 
pedia of Illinois," and the work is practically ready for 
publication. Dr. Bateman died October 21, at the age 
of seventy-five. 



STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.* 

The interest shown by New Testament scholars 
in the life of Jesus is repeatedly evidenced in pub- 
lishers' lists. Here, quite as much as in any biblical 
works, the historical spirit is capable of producing 
studies in which doctrine is treated so objectively 
as to lose much of the metaphysical character from 
which it has so long suffered. 

In his " Student's Life of Jesus," Professor Gil- 
bert has given teachers an excellent help for the 
conduct of both seminary and college classes. It is 
written in simple style, and with considerable criti- 
cal liberality. Now biographers who deal with the 
Gospels in anything like a conservative spirit are 
altogether too prone to regard as separate episodes 
any accounts which are not strikingly similar, ob- 
livious of the fact that the same event may appear 
in very different guise in different families of 
sources. In the case of the three gospels, it is alto- 
gether probable that this is true of several accounts 
in which details are variant. Professor Gilbert has 
recognized this to a considerable extent, and has 
not fallen into the common fault of over-identifica- 
tion. Another excellence of the book is its Intro- 
duction, in which, despite the author's rejection of 
what seems to most authorities the most probable 
explanation of the origin of the Synoptics, he has 
given sufficient data to enable the student to get a 
very fair general conception of the synoptic prob- 
lems. And this is no small service. One may per- 
haps not always agree with some of the author's 
conclusions, and at times it is disappointing to find 
hesitancy in the treatment of questions ; but, after 
all, the book is admirably adapted for use by those 
persons who really want to begin the study of the 
life of Jesus according to modern methods. 

Very similar is the work of Professor Bruce. 
Though a sort of by-product of the study, it is written 
with soberness, and its conclusions, if not novel, are 
at least so simply stated as to give it a certain inde- 
pendent value. Here we find the critical spirit pro-

ducing something more than conjecture and destruc- 
tion. Professor Bruce, in popularizing the positive 
conclusions of a life of scholarship, has rendered no 
small service to the great number of intelligent men 
who do not care for processes, hut wish to study the 
character and teachings of Jesus in the same spirit 
as that with which they approach other men. As 
an elementary study of the chief peculiarities of each 
of the three synoptists it will be found of great aid 
by those who care more for rapid description than 
for the minutiae of criticism. Perhaps the most 
striking certainly the most novel portion of the 
work is the addition of a catechism by the use of which 
it is hoped that young minds may be early indoctri- 
nated with the proper conceptions of Jesus. It is 
to be feared that few except Scotchmen will feel 
deeply the need of such an instrument, but none the 
less is it suggestive and valuable as a sort of epitome 
of Professor Bruce's own position. 

There has been a great lack of good commentaries 
upon the Third Gospel, and for this reason, if for 
no other, the new volume by Professor Plummer is 
welcome. As a book to be used, it has the excellence 
of the other volumes of the " International Critical 
Commentary Series " admirable paragraphing, 
suggestive variation in style, clear analyses. It is 
evidently the fruit of great reading and study. The 
Introduction contains an exhaustive treatment of the 
literary peculiarities of Luke, as well as an admir- 
able discussion of his point of view. Professor 
Plummer rejects the allegation that Luke wrote 
under Ebinistic influences, and has admirably 
summed up the whole susceptibility of Luke to social 
problems in declaring that he is opposed to worldli- 
ness but not to wealth. As to the sources whence 
Luke drew his materials, the author seems to hold, 
though with some hesitation, the current view of 
two main and several supplementary groups of 
material. He does not, however, very often make 
use of such a critical position as a means of solving 
some of the questions suggested by a comparison of 
Luke and Matthew, but seems to prefer to regard 
Jesus as having repeated many of his sayings a 
position that becomes somewhat difficult when 
applied to the relations of the " Sermon on the 
Plain " and the " Sermon on the Mount." Indeed, 
one cannot escape a feeling of disappointment in 
seeing how little bearing the whole critical position 
of the Introduction has upon the main portion of the 
Commentary. English (not Scotch) scholar ship seems 
far more conservative one is tempted to say cautious 
than American in grappling with the critical ques- 
tions of the New Testament. The exegesis (despite 
the absence of word-studies and the preference of a 
known Cremer and Trench to an unknown Vincent 
and Thayer) is sober and scholarly. It is most satis- 
factory to see Jesus freed of the amiable prodigality in 
charity given him by the Authorized Version through 
the mistranslation of the Greek. Altogether, the work 
bears out the promise given by the volume of Sanday 
and Headlam on Romans, and is easily the best com- 
mentary on Luke produced in English. 



The latest addition to the same series is much 
smaller in compass, and deals with matters of much 
less difficulty. Yet among the numerous commen- 
taries in Phillippians, this of Professor Vincent is 
bound to be ranked more highly than his Preface 
modestly hopes. The work is characterized by the 
same thoroughness that one has learned to expect 
from its author, and although we shall be slow to 
forget the work of Lightfoot, it will be difficult to 
find as equally compact and complete an Introduc- 
tion as that furnished in the present volume. Very 
sensibly Professor Vincent has not attempted to pad 
his volume up to a regulation number of pages, but 
has been content to explain that alone that needed 
explanation. Yet on the great doctrinal passage, 
2:6-10, he has given a most exhaustive study of 
the words employed. Other special studies, though 
naturally not as numerous as those in some of the 
other volumes of the series, are equally good. It is 
also gratifying to see that in the discussion of these 
strongly rhetorical passages, Professor Vincent holds 
fast to his conception of the informal, untheological 
character of the letter as a whole. His discussion 
of Philemon is marked by sympathy and apprecia- 
tion, and his full discussion of the relations of Paul- 
ine Christianity to slavery are interesting, both his- 
torically and sociologically. 

It is perhaps not altogether without significance 
that the most notable contributions during the past 
few months to New Testament study have been 
made in connection with the two series in each of 
which Professor Briggs is co-editor, for such results 
point to the increasing fruitf ulness of the critical 
method of which he has become one of the chief 
representatives. Of them all we are tempted to 
regard the work of Professor McGiffert as on the 
whole worthy of the most consideration, both for 
the sweep of its treatment and use of historical 
criticism. Persons familiar only with the older 
English and American literature on the Apostolic 
Age will be especially impressed with this radical 
departure in method, and will perhaps also be dis- 
appointed to find that the neutral attitude of the 
historian has so largely replaced religious sympathy 
and fervor. But at the same time they will be com- 
pelled to admit the book's worth. Professor Mc- 
Giffert's positions on the chief questions at present 
undergoing investigation are in most instances revo- 
lutionary, not only of a received chronology of the 
Apostolic Age, but also in one instance at least (the 
date of the Epistle to the Galatians) of the current 
order of the events in Paul's life. To discuss these 
questions is here impossible, but one cannot alto- 
gether agree with (1) the identification of Paul's 
visits to Jerusalem, mentioned Acts 11, 15, and 
Galatians 2:1-10; (2) with the date of Galatians; 
(3) with the date of the accession of Felix, although 
in the latter case the author's position or one 
approximating it can claim the support of such 
names as Harnack and Oskar Holtzmann. Professor 
McGiffert's discussion of the Pastoral Epistles

Paul, though based upon and comprising genuine 
letters of the Apostle is especially strong. The 
other epistles of Paul, in common with the present 
semi-conservative tendency of criticism he regards 
as genuine. 1 Peter he ingeniously suggests was 
written by Barnabas, 2 Peter being the single pseu- 
donymous letter of the canon. In his criticism of 
Acts, Professor McGiffert, although giving no com- 
prehensive statement as to his position, is yet con- 
sistent, although at times his omission to set forth 
fully his critical position makes his decisions appear 
arbitrary. But taking the volume as a whole, we 
are impressed with its importance as a contribution 
to the literature of its subject, and may well con- 
gratulate American scholarship that it has produced 
a work conceived in the modern spirit, which, though 
perhaps less original than that work, cannot unfairly 
be classed with that of Weizsacker. 

SHAILER MATHEWS. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

" The Comprehensive Subject-Index 
to Universal Prose Fiction," by Mrs. 
Zella Allen Dixson (Dodd), is a 
bibliographical work for the guidance of novel- 
readers who wish to derive something more than 
amusement from works of fiction. " Only novels 
with a purpose, those which are sent out into the 
world with a definite lesson to teach mankind," are 
included in this list. The idea is an excellent one, 
and has before been embodied in the annotated 
catalogues of some of our larger public libraries, as 
well as in the special lists published from time to 
time by Mr. W. M. Griswold. The present volume 
is the most ambitious attempt that has yet been made 
in this direction, and gives the titles of many 
thousands of books, including novels in the chief 
continental languages. It would, perhaps, be a little 
unfair to criticise such a compilation for its omis- 
sions, which are many, or even for the fact that it 
includes a vast amount of rubbishy literature whose 
" definite lesson to teach mankind " is at least 
questionable. But the positive inaccuracies of the 
work are so glaring that they cannot be allowed to 
pass unnoticed. On the very first page the subject 
of Abbeys appears, and the classification runs after 
this fashion : MELBOSE. Monastery. Sir Walter 
Scott. NIGHTMARE. Nightmare Abbey. Thomas 
Love Peacock. NORTHANGER. Northanger Abbey. 
Jane Austen. It makes a queer sort of catalogue, 
but stranger things are to follow. When we find 
Boyesen's " Gunnar " under the head of " Vikings," 
and Franzos's "Ein Kampf urn's Recht" under 
" Galicia, Spain," we rub our eyes, but the climax 
is reached when we find Mr. Kenneth Grahame's 
" Golden Age " catalogued under " Lives of Christ." 
A book is frequently entered under several heads, 
as is proper, but it was hardly necessary, for the sake 
of Mr. Hall Caine, to provide lists under both 



" Isle of Man " and " Manx Life." And lest no 
searcher for instruction in the guise of fiction should 
miss M. Zola's " Lourdes," we find that work classi- 
fied under " Christian Science," " Ghost Stories," 
and " Medical Novels." As for the minor inaccu- 
racies, they are legion. It took us only about five 
minutes to spot the following : " Civil War, England, 
1625 " ; " Meimhold," for the author of " Die Bern- 
steinhexe " ; " Naulahke," for Mr. Kipling's novel ; 
" Valentius," f or Mr. Astor's "Valentino"; "Tollo," 
for " Tolla " ; J<Su Thoroddsen," for Jon of that 
ilk ; and " Olaf Trygg Veson," for the famous Norse 
King. 

A few years ago, when Browning 
rownin f g Society. Societies were something new under 

the sun, they were characterized as 
" fads," and described as " adult parsing societies 
for the working out of literary conundrums, puz- 
zles, and rebuses." How far these statements fail 
of the truth, in some cases, is shown by the con- 
tinued existence of the Boston Browning Society 
after twelve years, and by the publication of twenty- 
four of its papers as representative of its work dur- 
ing that time. The fact is that there are here no 
evidences of the verbal interpretation and gram- 
matical quibbling sometimes supposed to make up 
the proceedings of a Browning Club. On the con- 
trary, the papers deal with such themes as Brown- 
ing's thought, art, and philosophy, in a manner at 
once so sympathetic and so judicial that all lovers of 
good literary criticism, whether Browning students 
or not, must delight in them. Long ago somebody 
dubbed Browning " the poet of the opaques," and in 
the popular mind this has served to account for the 
clubs devoted to the study of his writings. But the 
popular mind mistakes. Browning societies were 
started, as Shakespeare societies are started, in order 
to read and re-read, to study and to know, a great 
poet, and in the belief that Browning, like every 
other, would be better enjoyed by repeated reading, 
more appreciated in proportion as better known. 
The work of the Boston Browning Society has been 
conducted in this spirit, and, numbering in its mem- 
bership such thinkers and writers as Col. Thomas 
Wentworth Higginson, Mr. Josiah Royce, Mr. 
George Willis Cooke, Dr. William J. Rolfe, Mr. 
Charles Carroll Everett, Miss Vida D. Scudder, and 
many others as able, though perhaps less known to 
fame, the result reflects no small glory upon con- 
temporary literary criticism in America. In this 
praise it is only fair to include the admirable and 
full Index made by Miss Dame, and the handsome 
setting given the volume by the Macmillan Company.

attention of students of comparative

dozen works written by Egyptian scholars, who have

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



" The Religion of the Ancient Egyptians " (Put- 
nam), a Professor in the University of Bonn, Ger- 
many, now gives us his translations and interpre- 
tation of the religious texts of Egypt. Though 
containing much that is technical, the book is ad- 
mirably adapted for the popular, if somewhat 
scholarly, thinker and reader. The chapters of the 
book are discussions of these among other topics : 
Sun worship, solar myths, the passage of the sun 
through the under world, chief deities, foreign 
deities, worship of animals, Osiris and his cycle, the 
Osirian doctrine of immortality, magic and sorcery, 
and amulets. By means of translations of the texts 
and of seventy-three illustrations, the author puts 
his theme in a clear-cut, concise, and attractive 
form. The point of view of Dr. Wiedemann is not 
always in agreement with that of his co-workers in 
the field of Egyptian lore, but he wisely presents, 
without wearisome and long-drawn-out discussion, 
the view most acceptable to his own mind. One of 
the chief points where universal agreement has not 
been reached is wisely handled by him in the fol- 
lowing statement (pp. 109, 110): "It is vain to 
draw far-reaching conclusions as to the fundamen- 
tal ideas of the ancient Egyptian religion. ... It 
cannot be proved from the inscriptions that no such 
conception [as monotheism] existed in Ancient 
Egypt. In view of the repeated attempts to bring 
the Egyptian religion forward in evidence, now on 
the one side and now on the other, in the discussion 
concerning an early monotheism, the fact must be 
emphasized again and again that no trustworthy 
evidence whatever is as yet afforded to either side 
by our knowledge of that religion. Among the 
chapters of the volume there is none of more inter- 
est than that on " The Osirian Doctrine of Immor- 
tality," also that on " The Worship of Animals." 
The whole volume presents many correctives of cur- 
rent erroneous views of Egyptian worship and de- 
serves the most careful consideration of every stu- 
dent of comparative religion. 

In Professor Carl C. Plehn's " Intro- 
duc tf<>n t Pablic Finance" (Mac- 
millan), we welcome the first Ameri- 
can work which attempts to treat the entire subject. 
We have many valuable monographs by American 
authors, covering different phases, but until the ap- 
pearance of this little treatise we were obliged to 
seek for scientific treatment of the whole field in 
other countries than ours. The attempt has here 
been made to present the fundamental principles of 
the science in a condensed form suitable for class- 
room use. The author gives in his preface the 
purpose of the book. " There can be no doubt that 
the most pressing reforms of the close of the nine- 
teenth century are tax reforms. The rapid exten- 
sion of governmental functions, the invasion by 
the government of fields of activity that lie near to 
the welfare of the people, has given rise to great 
interest in the financial side of these activities. It 
is hoped that this work may be helpful in the accom- 



plishment of these needed reforms." Public expen- 
ditures, public revenues, public indebtedness, and 
financial administration, are the main divisions of 
the subject. The author endeavors to remedy de- 
fects in previous treatises on the subject, and to es- 
tablish a uniformity of classification which shall 
hold through his entire work. The method adopted 
is that suggested by Professor Cohn for all public 
charges, the relation of contributions demanded to 
benefits conferred. The author follows his classifi- 
cation consistently, though laboring under evident 
difficulty at times in making his topic fit the classi- 
fication. The comparative study of financial systems 
is carried only so far as to include those of the 
United States, Germany, France, and England. 
We can hardly look for exhaustive treatment of any 
phase of the subject in a book of this size, the 
sections devoted to the various kinds of taxes are 
especially disappointing. Yet the book fills an 
urgent want, and is admirable for its intended 
purpose. 

An analysis of the forces controlling 
the g rowth a nd * he differentiation of 
the developing organism, and of the 
laws under which they operate, has been sought by 
the method of experiment upon the living egg. The 
salient achievements of this rising science of experi- 
mental embryology are set forth in Professor T. H. 
Morgan's " The Development of the Frog's Egg " 
(Macmillan). A full outline of the normal devel- 
opment is given, from the formation of the sex-cells 
to the hatching of the tadpole. The main emphasis 
of the work is laid, however, upon those alterations 
in the usual course of development which attend 
the introduction of new factors into the environ- 
ment of the egg. Rotation in a centrifugal ma- 
chine, pressure, inversion, mutilation, a weak salt 
solution, all result in characteristic abnormalities. 
Even the individuality of the organism is a toy in 
the hands of the experimenter ; from half-eggs 
half-embryos can be produced, but if the half-egg 
be inverted a whole embryo of half-size results. 
Subdivision of the egg (of the sea-urchin) gives 
several embryos, where normal development would 
have produced but one. A suggestive discussion of 
the results thus far attained is placed before the 
intending student, but he must still look to the orig- 
inal sources for an adequate account of the methods 
employed. 

HOW wealth is Dr - Spahr's recent work entitled "An 
distributed in the Essay on the Present Distribution 
United states. of Wealth in the United States" 
(Crowell) is a valuable contribution to the study of ex- 
isting society, and is suggestive and stimulating in its 
clear and forceful presentation of facts and figures. 
Statistical and dry are not synonymous terms as far 
as this volume is concerned. The subject is treated 
under the three heads of Distribution of Property, 
Distribution of Incomes, and Distribution of Taxes. 
It begins with a retrospect of English conditions 
since the Middle Ages, and reaches the startling 



1897.]

conclusion " that less than 2 per cent of the families 
of the United Kingdom hold about as much private 
property as all the remainder, and that 93 per cent 
of the people hold less than 8 per cent of the accu- 
mulated wealth." In the United States, the line of 
cleavage on questions of property is not between 
East and "West, as is usually thought, but between 
city and country, the natural result of the rapid in- 
dustrial concentration in business centres. Here, 
again, 1 per cent of the families of the United 
States receive one-quarter of its entire income. The 
author's conclusions lead naturally to a consideration 
of our much-deplored system of taxation, with its 
inequalities and consequent injustices. A remedy 
is not to be found, the author insists, in equal taxa- 
tion of property, even could that be secured. The 
public will demand, as a cure for its ills, a progres- 
sive property tax. " The public welfare is the 
supreme law, and the heart and conscience of the 
nation are bound to give effect to measures which 
shall make the wealth of the nation synonymous 
with the national well-being." 

To the story of the Indian and of the 

MIne ' in the " Stor y of the West " 

series (Appleton), Mr. E. Hough has 
added the " Story of the Cowboy." In the rapidly 
passing panorama of the development of the great 
West, the cowboy has always stood for the extreme 
of picturesqueness. Mr. Hough has not shorn him 
of any glamour or romance, but in addition gives a 
realization of the extent of his kingdom, the magni- 
tude of the interests entrusted to him, and the 
courage and hardihood necessary to his daily work. 
The reader of this most interesting book is brought 
into vivid touch with daily life on the plains, 
participates in " round-ups," chases the predatory 
41 rustler," and anathematizes " strays " and " Maver- 
icks." The last chapter is a plea for the cowboy to 
be regarded in history, not as an eccentric driver of 
horned cattle, but as a man suited to the times. He 
disappeared because of the small landholder, the 
sheep-herder, the fence-builder, and especially the 
irrigator. The mind's eye is aided in forming these 
pictures of the past by the page illustrations in the 
book from the brush of Mr. Russell, himself a 
dweller on a Montana ranch. 



A students conception of literature as a fit 

handbook of subject for systematic study in the 

literary art. schools is comparatively so new that 

each person, student or teacher, has been obliged 
largely to form his own methods of examining its 
contents and of defining the principles of its art. 
Neither the rhetorics nor the outlines of the his- 
tory of literature have thrown much light upon 
the principles which each critic must apply, at one 
point or another, whenever he writes a review, or 
in any way discusses a written composition. Miss 
Harriet Noble, in offering " A Handbook for the 
Study of Literary Art" (Inland Publishing Co.), 
has done a real service to students, whether in school 



or out. The purpose of the book is to lead the stu- 
dent to recognize literary work as art ; to collect 
and define all the more essential properties of this 
art connectedly, and to exemplify their application 
in systematic analysis. Schedules are presented 
intended to cover the essential characteristics of 
the three great classes of writing poems, dramas, 
novels. Themes, plans, amplification, versification, 
style, are the subjects of chapters containing much 
direct and suggestive material for the inexperienced 
lover of good literature. The concluding chapter, 
" Final Verdicts," is an up-to-date discussion of such 
modern literary forms as the compound tale, made 
up of a number of single poems, after the manner 
of Tennyson ; the dramatic monologue, Browning's 
favorite form ; symbolism, as practised by Ibsen, 
Maeterlinck, William Sharp, and others. The book 
is to be highly commended for doing well something 
that much needed doing. 

When the Dean of Norwich projected 

Lectures on * i i_ j i j 

the Fathers. a course * lectures to be delivered 

in Norwich Cathedral, presumably in 
1895 or 1896, and with the evident intention of 
having the lectures subsequently published in book 
form, he selected for the general subject "The 
Fathers." It is somewhat curious to find these lec- 
tures now collected and published under the title 
" Lectures on Ecclesiastical History " (Thomas 
Whittaker). It is also curious to find sandwiched 
in between a lecture on the life and times of St. 
Ambrose and one on Jerome, an essay (evidently 
not a lecture) on the Church in the Catacombs. 
Books thus prepared are more apt to exhibit a 
variety of literary styles than any other character- 
istic. And books on Church history thus produced 
are apt to present divergent views on some subjects 
of minor importance. This has been avoided in the 
present case by the care exercised by the Dean to 
select his lectures among Churchmen of the grade 
established by Dean Farrar, who delivered the first 
lecture in the course, upon Ignatius and Polycarp.

were but captains in the great line-up of sympathy 
or condemnation, the old against the new, the

fore gone constantly to every source which would 
indicate contemporary feeling on this subject, and 
especially to Gouverneur Morris, Thomas Jefferson, 
and James Monroe, who were capable eye-witnesses 
to many scenes of that great drama. But pressure 
upon the time of the student and reader has caused 
a compilation to be made, not alone of the sources 
indicated above, but of all " Contemporary Ameri- 
can Opinion of the French Revolution," by Professor 
Hazen of Smith College. It is scarcely just to speak 
of the work as a compilation, since the author has,

especially in the opinion of contemporaries at home, 
traced a connecting line and formed a concluding 
opinion which enables him to present his own views. 
But as a short cut to scattered matter the work will 
prove most useful. It comes as an " extra volume " 
in the " Johns Hopkins University Studies." 



Another 
Jubilee Boole. 



One of the more noteworthy of the 
hundred and one books about the 
Queen and her reign, brought out on 
the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee, is " The Pri- 
vate Life of the Queen, by a Member of the Royal 
Household," published in this country by the Messrs. 
Appleton. The book is sufficiently characterized 
by one sentence in the author's preface : " My con- 
cern is merely with the petty personal details of the 
greatest woman of her time. . . ." The writer is 
evidently a woman, and, we conjecture, a former 
maid-of-honor. The minuteness of her information 
will give pleasure to the curious, while her refuta- 
tion of a number of false reports and correction of 
wrong impressions concerning her sovereign will 
gratify the latter 's admirers. Eleven good half- 
tone illustrations enliven the text. But why could 
not the author have eulogized the Queen without 
murdering the Queen's English? Too frequent for 
the entire enjoyment of the reader are such inele- 
gant constructions as the following : " To the right 
are a magnificent line of fourteen vineries, broken 
only in the centre by Mr. Owen Thomas's, the head 
gardener, picturesque house." 

The fourth volume of Mr. Donald G. 
, el Mitchell's " English Lands, Letters, 

and Kings" (Scribner) deals with 
the period of the Later Georges to Victoria. It 
opens upon that always delightful country of hills 
and waters known as the Lake District of England, 
and pictures the interesting lives of its illustrious 
brotherhood of poets and essayists, passes on to Scott 
at Abbotsford, to Edinboro' and its famous " Re- 
view," full of power and pyrotechnics, to London 
and Walter Savage Landor, " master of classicism, 
master of language, but never quite master of him- 
self," and so on to the great names of the beginning 
of the century, Byron, Shelley, Keats. Only the 
very early days of Victoria's reign come into view, 
and thus we may look forward to at least one more 
volume in this delightful series the sooner the 
better, for these little books have a certain charm 
distinct from any others, one which age cannot wither 
nor custom stale for those who read and loved " Ik 
Marvel " when both they and he were young. 

Some resurrected Between the years 1820 and 1823, 
pot-Miing work Thomas Carlyle did much "pot- 
oj Carlyle. boiling " work for " Brewster's Ed- 

inburgh Encyclopaedia," in the shape of biograph- 
ical essays. " Wretched lives," he himself called 
them in his atrabiliary moments ; at other times, 
he confessed that he was seldom happier than when 
writing them. Brief as most of these writings are, 



and hardly to be ranked with his greater efforts,, 
they are yet fragments of honest, clear-lined work- 
manship, and certainly worth rescuing from the 
densely piled, double-columned debris of the ency- 
clopaedia. There are seventeen of these sketches in 
all; and being prefaced by a sympathetic intro- 
duction from the author's fellow-Scotsman, Mr. S. R. 
Crockett, and given a handsome dress by the pub- 
lishers (Lippincott), the book, which bears the title 
"Montaigne and Other Essays," will be welcomed 
by all lovers of Carlyle. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Professor L. Oscar Kuhns is the author of a little 
treatise on " The Treatment of Nature in Dante's 
' Divine Comedy ' " (Arnold), which proves to be a very 
creditable piece of work. " Nature " is, of course, 
taken in the modern sense of the term, rather than the 
metaphysical sense in which Dante himself used it. 
The quotations and parallel passages of which the book 
largely consists are grouped under such heads as Italy, 
the Flora, the Fauna, Atmospheric Phenomena, and the 
Heavenly Bodies. Professor Kuhns has also published 
(Crowell) an edition of Gary's translation of the " Divine 
Comedy," together with Rossetti's translation of " The 
New Life." Some of Gary's notes are retained, others 
are provided by the editor, and a good introduction 
prefaces the text. It remains to be said that the volume 
is a handsome one, and illustrated by an extensive series 
of well-chosen photographs. 

The volumes in the Dent-Macmillan series of "Temple 
Classics " and " Temple Dramatists " continue to multi- 
ply. In the first-named series the latest to reach us are 
Vols. II. and III. of Boswell's Johnson, and Vols. IV. 
and V. of Montaigne's essays (both works to be com- 
pleted in six volumes) ; and Chapman's translation of 
the " Odyssey " in two volumes. In the series of 
" Dramatists " we have lately had four new volumes, 
comprising : " Edward III.," edited by Mr. G. C. Moore 
Smith ; Sheridan's " The Rivals " and The Critic," 
both edited by Mr. G. A. Aitken ; and Fletcher's The 
Faithful Shepherdess," edited by Mr. F. W. Moorman. 
From the same publishers we have received " Bon- 
Mots of the Eighteenth Century," issued in their dainty 
series of " Bon-Mots," of which Mr. Walter Jerrold is 
the editor. Miss Alice B. Woodward's numerous little 
" grotesques " scattered throughout this volume add 
greatly to its attractiveness. 

" The Story of Jean Valjean " (Ginn), edited by Miss 
Sara E. Wiltse, is a volume in the series of " Classics 
for Children." It amounts to a translation of "Les 
Mise*rables," without some of the digressions of the 
original. As there are over a thousand pages in this 
version, it will be seen that the excisions are not con- 
siderable. 

The famous " Confessions " of Jean Jacques Rous- 
seau, in the English translation published anonymously 
a century ago, comes to us in the prettiest of reprints, 
with an introduction by Mr. S. W. Orson. There are 
four volumes, with illustrations after the designs made 
by M. Maurice Leloir. The imprint is that of Messrs. 
Gibbings & Co., London, and the work is sold in this 
country by the J. B. Lippincott Co.

LITERARY NOTES. 



The Century Co. has just published a new edition of 
Mr. John La Farge's " An Artist's Letters from Japan." 

"Seraphita," "The Seamy Side of History," and 
" Cousin Betty," are three new volumes in the Dent- 
Macmillau edition of Balzac. 

" Tom Moore in Bermuda " is the title of a brochure 
written and published by Mr. J. C. Lawrence Clark, of 
Lancaster, Mass. It is " a bit of literary gossip," attract- 
ively written and illustrated. 

" How to Build a Home " is the title of an excellent 
little book of Mr. Francis C. Moore, just published by 
the Doubleday & McClure Co. 

The Story of Germ Life," by Professor H. W. Conn, 
is published by the Messrs. Appleton in their series of 
little books of popular science called " The Library of 
Useful Stories." 

Volume IV. of " Cromwell," the life of Sterling, and 
" Past and Present," are the three latest volumes in the 
" Centenary " edition of Carlyle, published by Messrs. 
Charles Scribner's Sons. 

We are pleased to hear that Dr. H. H. Furness has 
finished editing " A Winter's Tale," which will soon 
appear as a new volume of the " Variorum " Shakes- 
peare, published by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

It is interesting to know that the Oxford University 
Press, in establishing an American branch, has incor- 
porated it under the laws of New York, its business 
being carried on by a staff of American citizens, with 
Mr. Henry Frowde as president. 

" Tales of Humor," " Romance," and " Little Master- 
pieces " are the titles of three small volumes of short 
stories just issued by the new publishing house, the 
Doubleday & McClure Co. The latter of the three 
contains tales from Poe, edited by Mr. Bliss Perry. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. are the publishers of a 
" Natural History," the work of Mr. R. Lydekker and 
other specialists, which provides, in a compact volume 
of nearly eight hundred pages, a trustworthy survey of 
the animal kingdom as at present known to science. 

" The Dictionary of the Bible," planned by Robertson 
Smith, and since his death carried on by Professor 
Cheyne and Dr. Sutherland Black, is making steady 
progress, and five-sixths of the whole material is now 
in the editors' hands. The work will form a single very 
large volume, and be published by the Macmillan Co. 

One would hardly look for "literature" in the 
annual " Report of the Commissioner of Education," 
but the first volume of that valuable work for 1895-96 
contains at least one paper of high literary value. It 
is the account of " Early Educational Life in Middle 
Georgia," prepared for the Bureau of Education by 
Colonel Richard Malcolm Johnston, and quite as enter- 
taining as the fiction of that genial writer. 

A volume of "Selected Masterpieces of Biblical 
Literature " has been edited by Professor R. G. Moulton 
for The Modern Reader's Bible," and is published by 
the Macmillan Co. From the same publishers we have, 
in their series of " Economic Classics," a reprint of 
Augustin Cournot's " Researches into the Mathematical 
Principles of the Theory of Wealth," which appeared 
in 1838. The translation of the latter work is by Mr. 
Nathaniel T. Bacon. 

Francis Turner Palgrave, known to all readers as the 
editor of the best anthology of English lyrics ever com- 



piled, died on the twenty-fourth of October, at the age 
of seventy-three. A student of Balliol, a fellow of 
Exeter, and Professor of Poetry to the University, Pal- 
grave was all his life long an Oxford man and little else. 
He was an original poet of considerable merit, and a 
critic of no mean achievement, but it is as the editor of 
" The Golden Treasury " that he will be best remem- 
bered. 

Justin Winsor, for many years Librarian of Harvard 
University, died at his home in Cambridge on the 
twenty-second of last month. He was born in Boston, 
January 2, 1831, and obtained his education first at 
Harvard, then in Heidelberg and Paris. In 1868, he 
became Superintendent of the Boston Public Library, 
leaving that institution for Harvard in 1877. Besides 
being one of the leaders in his profession for a quarter 
of a century, he was one of the foremost of American 
historians. His ungraceful style will always debar him 
from taking rank with Parkman and Motley in popular 
favor, but his work has qualities of solid scholarship 
that insure it the esteem of them that know. His 
most important works are the " Memorial History of 
Boston " and the " Life of Christopher Columbus," while 
the great " Narrative and Critical History of America " 
was edited by him with such discerning judgment and 
range of scholarship that his fame will rest upon that 
work quite as much as upon his original contributions 
to historical and cartographical knowledge. 

The death of Charles Anderson Dana, on the seven- 
teenth of October, removed from American journalism 
one of its most conspicuous figures. Mr. Dana was 
born August 8, 1819, in New Hampshire, and spent his 
boyhood in Buffalo. He entered Harvard in 1839, but 
was compelled by defective eyesight to give up his 
studies for the time, and soon thereafter attached him- 
self for a brief period to the Brook Farm community, 
which accident, rather than serious significance, has 
made so famous an episode in New England history. 
After a few years of miscellaneous journalism, he became 
managing editor of the New York " Tribune," retaining 
that connection until 1862. He was then employed by 
the War department at Washington for several years, 
then embarked upon a short-lived newspaper enterprise 
in Chicago, and finally, in 1867, became the proprietor 
and editor of the New York " Sun." It is as the editor 
of that journal that he is best known, although he did 
a certain amount of fairly creditable literary work. In 
spite of its excellence in make-up, in the use of language, 
and in the collection of news (or rather, perhaps, because 
of those qualities, so admirable in themselves), the 
" Sun " has exercised a deeply demoralizing effect upon 
American journalism, and the remarkable abilities of 
its editor have usually been put to the worst possible 
use. There has hardly been a scoundrel in public life 
during the past generation whom the " Sun " has not 
championed, hardly a vicious measure of government 
that it has not espoused. On the other hand, it has 
waged persistent warfare upon men whom the nation 
has delighted to honor, and upon reforms that have 
enlisted in their behalf the best elements of the entire 
community, and all this with a malignity, a vindictive- 
ness, and an unscrupulous mendacity that have rarely 
been approached even in American journalism. In thus 
outraging both the intelligence and the moral sentiment 
of the public, the paper has gone so far as to defeat its 
own purposes, and in this fact must be sought whatever 
compensation there is for the degradation of its thirty 
years' presence among us.

OLD VIRGINIA AND HER NEIGHBOURS. 

By JOHN FISKE. 2 vols., crown 8vo, gilt top, $4.00. 

These volumes cover the settlement and growth of Vir- 
ginia, Maryland, the Garolinas, and Georgia, nearly to the 
Revolution. It is a most interesting story, and has never 
before been told with the critical insight, the philosophic 
grasp, and the distinct literary charm with which it is here 
told by Mr. Fiske. 

THE CRITICAL PERIOD OF AMERICAN 
HISTORY, 1783-1789. 

With about 170 illustrations, comprising Portraits, 

Maps, Facsimiles, Contemporary Views, Prints, and 

other Historical Materials. 8vo, $4.00; half calf, 

gilt top, or half polished morocco, $6.25. 

This edition follows the same lines of illustration which 

were adopted in the Illustrated Edition of " The American 

Revolution." Nothing is done merely for decoration, and 

every illustration has a positive historic character and value. 

THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT. 

The Colonies and the Republic West of the Alleghanies, 
1763-1798. With full Cartographical Illustrations 
from Contemporary Sources. By JUSTIN WiNSOR. 
8vo, gilt top, $4.00. 

This volume completes the story begun by Dr. Winsor in 
" Cartier to Frontenac " (1534-1700), and continued in " The 
Mississippi Basin " (1697-1763), illustrating American History 
in its Geographical Relations from the time of Columbus to 
the beginning of this century. The three volumes are eloquent 
witnesses to Dr. Winsor's tireless research ; they are very 
rich in old maps ; and they form a repository of historic 
material of great and permanent value. 

THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST: 

&n Interpretation. 

By ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS, author of " A Singular 

Life," " Chapters from a Life," " The Gates Ajar," 

etc. With many illustrations selected from the works 

of modern masters. Crown 8vo, $2.00. 

Mrs. Ward has had in her heart for many years one purpose, 

which at last is in this book accomplished. By heredity, by 

environment, by training, by study, and by consecration, she 

is peculiarly fitted to illumine the central figure in history. 

And her "Story of Jesus Christ," written with the fullest 

consent and power of her intellect and soul, promises to be 

her greatest work and one of the most notable books of our 

time. 

EVANGELINE. 

By HENRY W. LONGFELLOW. New Holiday Edition.

10 full-page illustrations in color and 12 head and

CAMBRIDGE BURNS. 

THE COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS OF 
ROBERT BURNS. 

With a Biographical and Critical Essay by W. E. HEN- 
LEY, Notes and Indexes to Titles and First Lines, 
Glossary, etc. With a floe portrait of Burns, and an 
engraved title-page containing a view of Burns's 
home. 1 vol., 8vo, gilt top, $2.00 ; half calf, gilt top, 
$3.50 ; tree calf, or full levant, $5.50. 
This edition of Burns's complete Poetical Works has been 
edited with the utmost care, on the same plan which has 
proved so acceptable in the Cambridge Editions of Longfellow, 
Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, and Browning. The very ample 
and unusually judicious equipment of Notes, furnished to the 
Centenary Edition of Burns by Mr. T. F. Henderson, has been 
incorporated, and everything has been done to render this the 
most complete, the most accurate, the most judiciously anno- 
tated, the best edited, of all the editions of Burns yet produced. 

THE THEOLOGY OF AN EVOLUTIONIST. 

By LYMAN ABBOTT, D.D., author of " Evolution and 
Christianity," "Christianity and Social Problems," 
etc. 16mo, $1.25. 
In this striking book Dr. Abbott's object is not to convince 

orthodox believers that Evolution is true, but to convince 

believers that they need not give up their Christian faith 

because they have become evolutionists. 

SEVEN PUZZLING BIBLE BOOKS. 

A Supplement to "Who Wrote the Bible?" By 
WASHINGTON GLADDEN, D.D., author of "Applied 
Christianity," " Tools and the Man," " The Lord's 
Prayer," etc. 16mo, $1.25. 

Familiar and very luminous lectures on certain books of 
the Bible which in various ways puzzle their readers Judges, 
Esther, Job, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Songs, Daniel, and 
Jonah. 

INEQUALITY AND PROGRESS. 

By GEORGE HARRIS, D.D., author of " Moral Evolu- 
tion." 16mo, $1.25. 

Dr. Harris sustains with great force the thesis that inequal- 
ity is an indispensable condition of human progress. Mr. 
Bellamy's " Equality" is inferentially, and to some extent 
directly, criticised. 

BEING A BOY. 

By CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER. Holiday Edition. With 
an Introduction and 32 full-page illustrations from 
photographs by CLIFTON JOHNSON. 12mo, gilt top, 
$2.00. 
Mr. Warner's charming book is supplemented with many 

capital pictures of rural boy-life. 

GONDOLA DAYS. 

By F. HOPKINSON SMITH, author of " Tom Grogan," 
" Colonel Carter of Cartersville," " A Day at La- 
guerre's," " A. White Umbrella in Mexico," etc. With 
illustrations by the author. 12mo, $1.50. 
Those who are familiar with Mr. Smith's writings will need 

no assurance of the freshness, vigor, pictnresqueness, and 

charm of this book on Venice. Several illustrations by the 

author add to its value and attraction.

PRIZE WINNERS. 

We have been publishing each year as a holiday gift a book 
of merit and beauty, surpassing anything ever offered for 
the purpose by others. Of these books, " Titus " and " The 
Wrestler of Philippi" are too well known to need comment. 
Desiring to secure an exceptionally choice book for this year, 
we published an offer to writers of $1000 for the best book 
that should be submitted to us. In response two hundred 
and sixty-three manuscripts were received. From these 
" The Days of Mohammed" was selected by the judges as 
being the best. 

$1000 PRIZE STORY. 

The Days of Mohammed. 

By ANNA MAT WILSON. 

Yusaf, a Persian, of the Guebre, or fire-worshipping sect, 
has, at his first sacrifice of a human life, revolted against the 
horror of his religion. He conceives a vague idea of a different 
God, his whole soul calls out for light in his darkness, and he 
decides to leave Persia in search of Truth. 

In his travels he hears of the famous Caaba, or temple, at 
Mecca, and, in the hope that he may find what he seeks, he 
sets out for that city. There he meets that strangest char- 
acter of ancient or mediaeval times, Mohammed. 

In " The Days of Mohammed " the author attempts to 
show the manner and result of the priest's quest, and endeavors 
to exemplify, in the career of Yusuf and that of his contem- 
poraries, the change which the realization of a companionship 
with God brings into each life. 

The scene of the story is confined almost entirely to Arabia, 
and the plot is based upon the early Mohammedan war, in 
which, for the first time, was raised the cry, " The sword of 
God and the prophet ! " that dread cry which has been re- 
echoed through the centuries, and has, in our own time, been 
brought home with such heart-piercing force to all who have 
looked upon the terrible atrocities but lately committed in 
Armenia.

OLD CREOLE DAYS. e y GEORGE w. CABLE. 

With 8 full-page Illustrations and 14 head and tail pieces by ALBERT HERTER, all reproduced in photogravure, and with 

an original cover design by the same artist. 8vo, $6.00. 

A few copies still left of the Special Limited Edition on Japan paper. Each $12.00 net. 

This edition of Mr. Cable's masterpiece is a most remarkable achievement. Mr. Herter's illustrations, while charmingly in key with the 
stories, are exquisite in their firmness, grace, and feeling. Indeed, they have probably never been equalled in these qualities by any American 
illustrator. The volume, with its wide margins, fine paper, and beautiful printing, really marks an epoch in the art of bookmaking on this 
side of the water, and forms an ideal gift-book. It is as unique in its mechanical perfection as the stories themselves are in our literature. 

THE FIRST CHRISTMAS TREE. By HENRY VAN DYKE. 

With full-page illustrations by HOWARD PYLE, reproduced in photogravure, decorative borders, illuminated title, and a 

striking cover design. 8vo, $1.50. 

Dr. Van Dyke is here in his happiest vein, for his keen feeling for nature and his deep religious sense have combined to render this story, 
dealing as it does with the transition to Christianity from primitive savagery, vivid and moving in the extreme. The illustrations by 
Mr. Howard Pyle are noteworthy examples of that artist's sterling and satisfactory work. 

THIS COUNTRY OF OURS. By BENJAMIN HARRISON, Ex-President of the United States. 

12mo, $1.50. 

" The purpose of the book is to give a better knowledge of things thai have been too near and familiar to be well known. I hope it may also 
tend to prumote an intelligent patriotism and a faithful discharge of the duties of citizenship." AUTHOE'S PBBFACK. 

CONTENTS: The Constitution The Congress The President The State Department The Treasury Department Departments of 
War and Justice The Post Office Department The Navy Department Departments of the Interior and Agriculture Independent 
Boards and Commissions The Judiciary. 

"Nowhere could there be found a volume better adapted to popular use than this compendium of one of the wisest of our Presidents." 
New York Tribune. 



SONG BIRDS AND WATERFOWL. 

By H. E. PARKHURST. With 18 full-page illustrations by 

Louis Agassiz Fuertes. 12mo, $1.50 net. 

The author has already shown in his " Bird's Calendar " that the 
amateur ornithologist need not go far afield to pursue his study of 
our birds. In the present volume he tells of the land and water birds 
easily found, and his pleasant descriptions are charmingly supple- 
mented by Mr. Fuertes' illustrations, which are fresh evidences of 
this artist's great ability. 

THE STEVENSON SONG BOOK.

STEVENSON, with music by various composers. (A com- 
panion volume to the " Field deKoven Song Book "

Little Rivers. With an etched frontispiece by GUSTAV MEBCIEB.

word. " Saturday Review. 
The Poetry of Tennyson. With an etched portrait by GUSTAV 

MBRCIBB. EDMUND CLARENCE STEDHAN has declared of this work : 

" No truer and more sympathetic analysis has yet been made of our 
greatest living poet." In the present edition the author has added 
an introduction and a thoughtful essay on " In Memoriam." 

MRS. KNOLLYS, AND OTHER STORIES. 

By F. J. STIMSON ( " J. S. of Dale ") . Author of " Guern- 
dale." "First Harvests," "King Noanett," etc. 12mo, 
$1.50. 

There is a flavor about Mr. Stimson's stories that is all his own. 
"First Harvests," "The Residuary Legatee," "Guerndale," "The 
Crime of Henry Vane," "In the Three Zones," etc., could have been 
written by no one but " J. 8. of Dale," and the present volume con- 
tains some of his best work, including two new stories. 

TWO NEW VOLUMES IN THE "IVORY 
SERIES." 

Literary Love Letters and Other Stories. By ROBERT 

HERRICK, author of " The Man Who Wins." 16mo, 75c. 

Mr. Herrick's present volume, containing seven short stories,

tinction. His stories are notable alike for their admirable literary 
quality and their vivid presentation of the subtler phases of character.

A NEW IDEAL IN AMERICAN FICTION. 

No student of American life and literature, 
however slight his claim to the title, can have 
failed to observe that in the past few years a 
marked if not vital change has come over 
American fiction. As the century draws to a 
close, it becomes evident that the fiction of its 
last decade is to be chronicled as presenting 
almost a contrast to that of the decade preced- 
ing it, and this even more in the radical 
matters of spirit and choice of subject than in 
the matter of art. 

In the eighties, the American ideal of fiction 
was summed up in the magical and much- 
abused word " realism," by which was meant, 
sometimes the analysis of character, sometimes 
the delicate and subtle setting forth of episode, 
and sometimes the portrayal of life as it ap- 
pears on the surface, with only floating hints 
as to its great undercurrents of motive and 
passion. It was generally thought that " in 
some way or other, the stories had all been 
told"; and it was thought, too, that the history 
of a soul, to be artistically rendered, should 
be written as by one who stood without and 
guessed, rather than as by one who stood within 
and knew. Life, it was argued, has such and 
such an appearance therefore, paint it so, 
and leave the picture to be interpreted as it 
may be ; in like manner, the greater passions 
and emotions are generally hidden under a 
mask of conventionality, and the artist should 
show the mask, letting the secret things be 
guessed at. 

That this ideal has been followed by some 
of our rarest talent, and that the work it 
necessitated was often of great artistic beauty, 
is not to be denied ; and we remember, also, 
that its followers have at times overstepped 
their own prescribed bounds, to deal with the 
openly sublime, magnificent, or beautiful. But 
it was too limited an ideal to compel any long 
period of service, save from a scattered few ; 
it was not realism in the larger sense, but only 
a phase of it ; and as a popular ideal of fiction 
(one says " popular " with an inward surety of 
contradiction) it has given way to another, 
limited itself, but of greater stature and richer 
life-blood. 

But while the fiction of the former ideal 



270 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



gave us life highly individualized, and falls 
therefore into the realm of realistic art, the 
fiction of the present day does not belong en- 
tirely to the realm of ideal art; it strives, indeed, 
to give " life essential," but it would also pre- 
sent the individual life. It differs from the 
other insomuch as its tendency is toward the 
typical rather than the single ; insomuch as it 
is apt to show the growth of a soul rather than 
to analyze a given character ; insomuch as it 
chooses, not the commonplace, in which realism 
found its best material, but the high, the heroic, 
the confessedly great or tragic or pathetic ele- 
ments of human life. We are reading as 
in " Hugh Wynne " stories of the Revolu- 
tion, where, not so many years ago, we read 
analyses of modern society ; we are reading 
as in the work of Mr. Gilbert Parker and Mrs. 
Catherwood of men who, in peril and daring 
and conquest, renew for us the youth of our 
race ; we are reading as in " The Choir 
Invisible " of great spirits, fighting their way 
upward to peace through the hardships and 
mistakes of earth. 

We speak of this fiction as belonging to the 
present decade ; but immediately comes the 
correction that the new note was at least set 
vibrating in the latter part of the eighties, by 
such pieces of fiction as " Marse Chan," " The 
White Cowl," and " The Romance of Dollard," 
stories that seized upon naked pathos, pas- 
sion, and splendor, and presented them with no 
affectation of indifference. But these and a 
few like them were only the heralds of the 
changed order. At this time American fiction 
is almost entirely occupied with the heroic 
affairs of life with bold self-sacrifices, with 
magnificent fidelities, with the signal passions 
of love and hate and war, with man's sin and 
penitence and expiation. Even our short 
stories deal with these high matters ; and the 
writer who has won the most immediate popu- 
larity of his day, and has set a style for the 
emulation of others, is a young man who dared 
to take a youth of New York fashion-dom, put 
a forsaken child in his arms, and send him out 
at midnight to deliver a speech of quiet but 
intense appeal to the child's unloving father. 
The public critical and uncritical, sensitive 
and dull was ready at that very time for such 
expressions of feeling ; so ready that it would 
accept even sentimentalities from one who had 
proved his power over genuine emotion. 

That this fiction should be considered " ro- 
mantic " is not at all strange ; and if by 
* romanticism" is meant the revival of wonder 



at the mystery and the greatness of life, the 
adjective is well applied. There has been such 
a revival, the second in our century, and it has 
struck out two broad avenues of expression 
the one, fiction ; the other, the historical essay. 
Our interest in our own history, in the splendid 
makings of our nation, in those stirring scenes 
of which our near fathers were the protagonists, 
is as much a part of this romanticism as our 
most romantic fiction which, indeed, is fath- 
ered by historical research. And the argument 
from all this is greatly in our favor. Despite the 
mock-heroics and sentimentalities which are 
foisted on us in its name, despite the invitation 
which it extends to a lower order of talent, to 
a weak or flamboyant art, it is a movement 
which " means intensely and means good." 
When it takes the form of history, it signifies 
a deepening of our national consciousness and 
a desire to be worthy of the courage from which 
we sprang ; when it takes the form of fiction, 
it is a sign that we are thinking of the majestic 
proportions of humanity, of the nobler possi- 
bilities of our nature. It is well for us, both 
as public and as individuals, to have a day of 
such great things ; their effect upon us is, in 
some measure, the effect of the sublime epics 
of the world, of the beautiful sculpture and 
painting and architecture and music, under the 
spell of which our pettiness falls away from us 
like a garment, and we are raptured by the 
glory of life. This new fiction has faults and 
shortcomings, but at its best it can stir the 
blood, it can rouse the larger emotions, it can 
cheer the soul. For it is based on this truth : 
that, though our more ordinary affairs may 
furnish a great part of the gamut of tragedy 
and comedy, the things which appeal to all 
men as great or brave or lovely or pathetic are 
also, and as deeply, the verities of our existence. 
MARGARET STEELE ANDERSON. 



TEACHING ENGLISH FOR A LIVE- 
LIHOOD. 

One factor in the recent notable and somewhat 
unwieldy development of the English Department 
in our American universities has been, probably, the 
necessity for a livelihood for college men. The 
field was attractive, but offered accommodations for 
few. The influx of settlers necessitated the staking 
of new claims. English teachers in ten years have 
multiplied like a Klondike census ; English courses 
like mining enterprises in Alaska. Prospecting has 
crossed all bounds and got clear out of touch from 



1897.]

reason and tradition. Under the name of English 
go on all manner of destructive practices, and soon 
we shall not recognize our classics under the rubbish- 
heaps of the new camps. 

The ranks of all professions contain those who 
have had (as it is said in the case of the ministry) 
no " call "; who have entered where the least resist- 
ance was. The English teaching profession, as 
everyone knows, is no exception. We can all count 
the " uncalled " of our professional acquaintance in 
multiples of the " called "; and if in the end we are 
all found somewhere in the first list, we may wink 
at the joke and still be very sure that the difference 
is there with the distinction, nevertheless. 

The new impetus given to the study a dozen years 
ago affected at first only the writing side of English. 
The reforms, once started, soon ran headlong. 
From increased attention to writing we went on to 
enlarge the field of literary study. Colleges that 
had employed one man to teach the entire subject 
began to appoint instructors for particular subdi- 
visions of the work. Literature and linguistics were 
early drawn apart, the chair in the larger universities 
being divided into two. Rhetoric and composition 
were set off as a third chair. This line of division 
complete, a new tack was taken. Literature was 
divided, and we got in some cases a chair of Ameri- 
can Literature. This was not enough, and soon we 
saw chairs of the history of English literature and 
of mere literature, of Elizabethan literature and of 
Restoration literature, of Eighteenth Century and of 
Nineteenth Century literature. And where separate 
departments were not thus created, the work of in- 
struction was distributed to assistants specially pre- 
pared in the respective subdivisions. But the end 
was not yet. Each teacher must offer many courses. 
Periods were subdivided indefinitely, and individual 
authors began to receive microscopic attention. 
Entire courses in a single writer became the vogue, 
and almost any literary figure, irrespective of his 
importance, was put down in one announcement or 
another as the subject of a semester's work. So 
minute is this subdivision of the subject at last, that 
twenty representative American universities average 
twenty courses each. Some offer fifty courses and 
have half as many instructors.* 

This multitude of courses in English that has 
come to string out our university catalogues, to allure 
the " snap "-seeking student, and to keep busy a 
surplusage of instructors, is in itself evidence that 
something has overreached itself. For the most 
part, the abuses resulting from the attempt to make 
too much of one author are so familiar as to require 
only passing reference. To this class belongs the 
sort of course that attempts to blend literary with 
philological study, with the invariable result that the 
literary is swamped by the philological from the 
start. A favorite victim for this sacrifice is Chaucer. 
If as much as twelve weeks be allotted to this poet 
in a reading course, one is obliged to resort to linguis- 

*See "English in American Universities." 



tics to fill out the time. The result always, by a 
kind of Gresham's Law, is that the technical drives 
out the aesthetic. " The Canterbury Tales " in most 
universities is a word-chasing course of the worst 
type ; students get no notion of Chaucer's charm, 
nor often any notion at all about him save that he 
is a great bore and a fine fellow to cut. 

The drawing out of poetical studies by drills in 
versification, and of prose studies by mechanical 
examination of the rhetoric ; the still inextinct bar- 
barism of attending more to the man or to what 
criticism has to say of him than to the man's work, 
one hurries over these to notice the most curious 
perversion of all. This is the " counting " fad. It 
is research work, and prevails chiefly in graduate 
schools. A subject is chosen for investigation, say 
a certain poet's " use of color." The student goes 
to work with notebook and pencil, rather with many 
notebooks and many pencils, to get up statistics that 
will show what colors and shades the poet mentions 
most and least. The process is simple : all the reds, 
oranges, yellows, and so forth, are counted ; in the 
end, totals are compared, and Whittier, let us say, 
is declared to incline to green, blue, indigo, or vio- 
let, or to bright tints rather than sombre ; or perhaps 
Whittier makes very little or very great use of color 
in general. This color study is a popular one among 
student specialists in English, and, sad to say, it is 
not undertaken by women alone. The men, how- 
ever, mainly attack topics seemingly less mild. A 
poet's " treatment of nature " is often the subject of 
investigation. Here, as before, we get columns of 
figures, only more of them. The counting is given 
a wider scope. The animals and vegetables (even 
the minerals sometimes) are listed and carefully 
assorted, the wild species being separated from the 
domestic. Again, a poet's use of figures of speech 
is the subject. A friend spent the whole of last 
winter counting the metaphors and similes, and cases 
of personification and Natur-beseelung in Keats, 
with the view of determining if there were more of 
one than of another. Other friends in other universi- 
ties are spending best years counting Browning ! 
Wordsworth's employment of the pathetic fallacy 
has been reduced to a mathematical statement, and 
no great poet is permitted to rest in peace. The 
" cahtter about Shelley " has been succeeded by a 
very perfect analysis and census in detail of Shel- 
ley's poetical anatomy. And this sort of thing is 
spreading. If we could overhear it, there is in too 
many colleges the statistical and the chemical talk 
about books ; and even in high-schools one may hear 
to a fine point of Spenser's greens and Tennyson's 
grays, till one knows not but he has got into a dye- 
house by mistake. 

" There is a way of killing truth by truths : under 
the pretense that we want to study it more in detail, 
we pulverize the statue." Amiel might almost have 
had some of the current methods in English imme- 
diately in mind. The pretense is usually present in 
these labored studies. The color census finds its 
origin and a modicum of justification in the desire

to verify or correct, for example, a quite general 
impression that Shelley employs many blues and 
akyey effects, or Swinburne sea effects and greens. 
But it has yet to be announced if such efforts have 
brought to light any worthy facts unapparent to 
observing readers on the surface. The effect of the 
October meadow yonder is brown : you need not 
count me the brown spears of grass to prove it ; the 
driving wind and the flakes in the face are proof 
enough of the blizzard : you may spare to measure 
us the snow-drifts. To be sure, there is one ex- 
tremely practical final cause of the counting, namely, 
the making of a thesis and the achievement of an 
advanced degree. If " Paradise Lost " is taken 
apart beyond possibility of ever being put together 
again, yea, and ground up past recognition into very 
powder, there is at least this to show for it : the 
particles make quite effective ammunition for the 
loading of masters' and doctors' theses. The papers 
on Milton that look like census tables may strike us 
as doubtful reading, but we may be very sure they 
are all " good stuff " for degrees. Aside from this, 
there is no excuse for much that is done in the name 
of English. It is scholasticism pure and simple; it 
is the attempt to make something out of nothing. 

The fact is, many American universities, perhaps 
American universities as a class, are trying to get 
too much out of literature. " Well," one says, " we 
are only trying to get out of it what there is in it."* 
But it is hard to believe that we get so much more 
out of English literature than the English universi- 
ties themselves, and the Scottish and the Irish. 
Professor Dowden is thought to be enough to teach 
all the English at Dublin, Professor Gollancz at 
Cambridge, Saintsbury at Edinburgh, Bradley at 
Glasgow, Andrew Lang at Aberdeen. And, an ex- 
ception in this country, Professor Gorson continues 
to constitute a pretty good department by himself 
at Cornell. These are all men of proved literary 
ability, of actual literary achievement. English teach- 
ing should stimulate to production. The method, 
if method there must be, should cry with Carlyle, 
Produce ! produce ! in God's name, produce ! By 
the British plan, immediate contact with a successful 
man of letters insures this stimulation. Professor 
Saintsbury passing the examination hour working 
on his next book is an object-lesson that teaches as 
no " method " has ever taught. 

English Literature, above all the other Humani- 
ties, is a subject that demands the services of the 
illuminated man of Thomas a Kempis, as against 
those of the learned and studious scholar. Ten of 
the latter will not cover the lack of the one. We 
have gone too far in our so-called " modern " En- 
glish teaching, and it will be well when we reverse 
the lever and allow play to a healthy reaction that 
will reduce the number while scrutinizing the fitness 
of both courses and men.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 

THE CRERAR LIBRARY AND THE WISHES 

OP ITS FOUNDER. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I knew the late John Crerar well, and I think the 
point made by T.V.V. in his letter printed in your last 
issue is properly taken. It seems to me that the use of 
the Crerar Bequest for the formation of an " exclusively 
scientific library " is a violation of a sacred memorial 
trust. 

When I first knew Mr. Crerar he was the president 
of a Library Association in New York City, and I was 
an assistant in the library. Some years after, when I 
had become the librarian of another institution, whose 
library had been formed by me, he called upon me and 
was much interested in my work and plans. He was a 
reticent man, and he told me nothing of his intentions, 
but I somehow formed a notion that he intended to found 
a great library, and I felt at the time that I should like, 
above all things, to be in a library of which he was the 
founder. We talked, among other matters, at this last 
meeting that I had with him, of the relative importance 
of history and literature and of science as means of the 
highest culture and of human improvement. I remem- 
ber showing him some opinions of eminent men in regard 
to the subject of our conversation. Dr. Samuel Johnson 
was one of these writers in whose views Mr. Crerar was 
particularly interested. 

It is extraordinary that a sacred public trust, like that 
founded by John Crerar, established, or intended by him 
to be established, for a specified beneficent purpose, to 
benefit a certain community, can be used for a purpose 
widely different from that clearly set forth in the testa- 
tor's will and in conversations with his friends. Books 
relating to engineering, chemistry, medical science, and 
all useful arts, would properly form part of a great 
library such as the Crerar Library was designed to be ; 
but Mr. Crerar was strenuously desirous that his library 
should be composed largely, if not mainly, of books re- 
lating to religious and moral subjects, the literature and 
history of all nations, with " examples that embody truth 
and prove by events the reasonableness of opinions." 
Human life and the formation of character were matters 
of far more importance, in Mr. Crerar's judgment, than 
the history of plants and animals, though incidentally 
these might be proper objects of interest, but only in a 
very subordinate degree to the study of human history 
and of literature. 

It is deplorable that boards of trustees, at their pleas- 
ure or discretion, can violate the terms of beneficent 
public trusts. The Crerar Library of Chicago and the 
Lenox Library of New York are conspicuous instances of 
such violations; and the communities most concerned 
should have the power to prevent such misuse of funds 
generously bequeathed for specific and wise purposes.

PROFESSOR FISKE AND FRANCIS BACON. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Professor John Fiske, in an interesting article in the 
November " Atlantic," opens his discussion of the Bacon- 
Shakespeare question with the "knock-down" argument 
that the whole matter is " the silliest mare's nest ever 
devised by human dulness." But in the zeal of his 
contest with this "windmill," he goes further, and assails 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



273 



Bacon directly, both in regard to his abilities and his 
services in the cause of science. He pronounces Bacon 
" one of the most overrated men of modern times," 
deprecates the current opinion that he " inaugurated a 
most beneficial revolution in the aims and methods of 
scientific inquiry," and places him " among intellects of 
the second order." He cites Whewell and Mr. Jevons 
as his authorities for this conclusion. 

In my " Francis Bacon and his Shakespeare " (1895), 
the original inquiry, in its deeper significance, broadens 
out into the vastly more important subject of the develop- 
ment of the Baconian spirit in Literature and Art. In 
outlining the essential antagonism and the struggle 
between the Platonic and the Baconian spirit tending 
also to a clearer comprehension of Bacon's services to 
mankind, I touch upon the point now in question ; and, 
in defense of Bacon, it is perhaps permissible to quote 
here the following passage, which seems pertinent: 

" And finally, he put this Induction to a crucial test, in the 
discovery of the then unknown nature of Heat, a discovery 
so true, so far in advance of his age, that it has given rise to 
one of the profound misconceptions regarding Bacon which 
this generation has inherited. Some of us doubtless remember 
studying in our youth Professor Comstock's * Natural Philos- 
ophy,' where we were taught that ' Heat is an imponderable 
substance called caloric.' And while the scientific world was 
under the sway of such a philosophy, Bacon's conclusion could 
only be regarded as visionary and preposterous. Whewell, in 
his 'Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,' [1840], says : 

" ' But we cannot be surprised, that in attempting to exem- 
plify the method which he recommended, he should have 
failed. For the method could be exemplified only by some 
important discovery in physical science ; and great discoveries, 
even with the most perfect methods, do not come at command. 
. . . Accordingly, Bacon's ' Inquisition into the Nature of 
Heat,' which is given in the Second Book of the ' Novum 
Organum' as an example of the mode of interrogating na- 
ture, cannot be looked upon otherwise than as a complete 
failure.' 

" Devey and Spedding, editors of Bacon's works, take the 
same view. And as late as 1886, Richard A. Proctor, the 
eminent astronomer, accepting the traditional opinion, in a 
letter published in the ' Arena ' of Nov., 1893, speaks of Bacon 
as ' failing egregiously in his attempt on the sole detail to 
which he applied his own method.' 

" But was it an egregious failure ? Turning to his ' Novum 
Organum,' we find that Bacon, at the end of his orderly In- 
duction, arrives at this conclusion : 

" ' From a survey of the instances, all and each, the nature 
of which heat is a particular case, appears to be Motion. . . . 
When I say of Motion that it is the genus of which heat is a 
species, I would be understood to mean, not that heat gener- 
ates motion or that motion generates heat ( thongh both are 
true in certain cases) , but that Heat itself, its essence and quid- 
dity, is Motion and nothing else. . . . Heat is an expansive 
motion, whereby a body strives to dilate and stretch itself to a 
larger sphere or dimension than it had previously occupied . . . 
that heat is a motion of expansion, not uniformly of the whole 
body together, but in the smaller parts of it ; and at the same 
time checked, repelled, and beaten back, so that the body 
acquires a motion alternative, perpetually quivering, striving 
and struggling, and irritated by repercussion, whence springs 
the fury of fire and heat. . . . Now from this our First Vintage 
it follows that the Form or true definition of heat (heat, that 
is, in relation to the universe, not simply in its relation to man ) 
is in few words as follows : Heat is a motion, expansive, re- 
strained, and acting in its strife upon the smaller particles of 
bodies, 1 ( Bacon's italics. ) 

" Professor George F. Barker, of the University of Penn- 
sylvania, in his able work on ' Physics,' recently published, 
states the present view of the nature of heat in these words : 

" ' Heat the Energy of Molecular Motion. Is heat-energy in 
the kinetic or in the potential form ? Davy said in 1812 : 



" The immediate cause of the phenomenon of heat, then, is 
motion; and the laws of its communication are precisely the 
same as the laws of the communication of motion." This 
in modern language is equivalent to the statement that heat is 
kinetic energy ; not evidently of the mass, since the hot body 
may be at rest ; but of the molecules. We know that one 
of the ways in which a hot body cools is by transferring its 
energy to another and a colder body not in contact with it ; 
and we shall study later the mechanism of this radiating pro- 
cess. One thing about it is certain, however, and that is that 
it consists in a motion of the intervening medium. The hot 
body communicates motion to the medium, and the cold body 
receives motion from this medium. We conclude, therefore, 
that the surface of a hot body must be in motion ; and because 
radiation may take place as well from the interior of a body 
as from its exterior, we also conclude that the body must be 
in motion throughout its entire mass. This view of the case 
is in entire accord with the kinetic theory of matter already 
discussed, which supposes the molecules of matter to be 
actively in motion. The motion to which heat- energy is due 
must therefore be a motion of parts too small to be observed 
separately ; the motions of different parts at the same instant 
must be in different directions ; and the motion of any one 
part must, at least in solid bodies, be such that however fast 
it moves it never reaches a sensible distance from the point 
from which it started. (Maxwell.) ' 

" As we carefully compare the foregoing statements, we can 
hardly realize that the one is a conclusion put forth three 
centuries ago, when there were comparatively no science or 
scientific instruments, and wrought out from the necessarily 
crude observations of the unaided senses ; and that the other 
is the expression of the latest conclusion of science, the pro- 
duct of a century of special research, conducted with the 
most delicate instruments, and by the brightest men of the 
time." 

In 1874, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, in the same para- 
graph from which Professor Fiske quotes, also wrote : 

" Francis Bacon held that science should be founded on ex- 
perience, but he mistook the true mode of using experience, 
and in attempting to apply his method ludicrously failed. 11 

Such was the discriminating power of the writer by 
whom Bacon's scientific reputation was " completely ex- 
ploded." Indeed, it is doubtful if Professor Fiske can 
cite a single adverse critic who has even suspected that 
Bacon's own avowed test of his Induction was other than 
a " complete," " egregious " and " ludicrous " failure. 
Limits forbid a discussion of the oft mooted question of 
the precise range and extent of Bacon's services to sci- 
ence; but it is apparent, from the foregoing, that his 
intellectual powers, instead of being " overrated," have, 
in reality, been appreciably undervalued, and that 
Macaulay's estimate, which Professor Fiske quotes 
almost contemptuously, will yet continue to command 
our respect. THERON S. E. DIXOK.

A gift of the Immortals, welling through

Bathe arid channels with their healing dew.

Unlocks the currents held in darkness there 

And song sweeps through with cadences divine!

THE LETTERS OF ELIZABETH BARRETT 
BROWNING.* 

Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman, who has 
just been delighting his readers with his vol- 
ume of " Poems now first Collected," in his 
" Victorian Poets " speaks of Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning as " the most inspired woman, so far 
as known, of all who have composed in ancient 
or modern tongues, or flourished in any land or 
time." Further on he quotes the well-known 
passage in which she gives expression to her 
feeling about poets and poetry. To her, poets 
were 

" The only truth- tellers now left to God ; 
The only speakers of essential truth, 
Opposed to relative, comparative, 
And temporal truths." 

The significance of poetry has never received 
finer expression ; the value of its idealizing 
tendencies has never been more certainly 
insisted on. The devotion of a lifetime to lit- 
erature could only be justified by the great 
good which would thereby accrue to mankind ; 
otherwise one ran the risk of losing oneself in 
empty frivolities or vain vagaries or rhetorical 
insincerities. The circumstances of her life 
emphasized for Mrs. Browning her deep appre- 
ciation of the real meaning of a literary career. 
Shut out by long-continued ill-health from the 
usual communications with the world, she was 
thrown back upon her own thought and the writ- 
ten record of the thought of others. Shielded 
as far as possible from every conflict which 
might do violence to her susceptibilities, she 
was saved from those depressing defeats which 
so often lame effort and dull enthusiasm. If 
thus some of her evident faults suffered exag- 
geration, yet ample room was given for the free 
development of her powers and the undimmed 
maintenance of the largeness of the work she 
felt called to do. When, later, she was brought 
into active connection with men and things, her 
mind was already matured, her art securely on 
its way, her determinations fixed. 

We already have the record of some phases 
of this unique life in poetical form ; for the 
Letters give renewed assurance to the auto- 
biographical character of " Aurora Leigh." In 
them, however, the self-revelation has that 
familiarity which belongs among friends, and it 
will not be easy to find an autobiography which

matches this collection of intimate outpourings 
of thought and sentiment. These are letters, 
indeed, written under the pressure of the mo- 
ment, and vital with the need or purpose of the 
day and hour. They cover the entire period of 
her life from her young womanhood to her 
latest years, and the editor has left them most 
judiciously to tell their own tale. 

Mr. Frederic G. Kenyon has brought to his 
task qualities which, unfortunately, not all ed- 
itors possess : a simple style, a profound sym- 
pathy for his subject, an unerring capacity for 
discerning where his explanatory introductions 
and notes and paragraphs are necessary. His 
share of the work deserves the praise and thanks 
of the reader, and he renews the generous rela- 
tions in which the Kenyons have always stood 
to the Brownings. One passage from his inter- 
esting and sensible preface should properly be 
reproduced here. 

" The duties of the editor have been mainly those of 
selection and arrangement. With regard to the former 
task one word is necessary. It may be thought that the 
almost entire absence of bitterness (except on certain 
political topics), of controversy, of personal ill-feeling of 
any kind, is due to editorial excisions. This is not the 
case. The number of passages that have been removed 
for fear of hurting the feelings of persons still living is 
almost infinitesimal; and in these the cause of offence is 
always something inherent in the facts recorded, not in 
the spirit in which they are mentioned. No person had 
less animosity than Mrs. Browning ; it seems as though she 
could hardly bring herself to speak harshly of anyone." 

We have here, therefore, a singularly com- 
plete reproduction of the life of Mrs. Browning, 
made by her own hand, and frequently supple- 
menting the utterances which we find in her 
poems. We follow her throughout her career, 
and listen to the comments which she makes 
upon the events into contact with which her 
widening and varying experiences bring her. 
The frail recluse is brought from her sick 
chamber, and it is not long before the whole 
world reverberates in her thought and words. 
Her interests constantly deepen and enlarge ; 
the realm of books releases its occupant into 
the realm of deeds ; the figures, great and small, 
who cross the scene, are the ones who fashion 
history as well as literature ; statesmen as well 
as poets, humanitarians as well as novelists. 
Poetry is seen to be only great when it so 
touches life that it becomes the voice of large 
intents and uplifting purposes. 

The early years of Mrs. Browning's life were 
spent in the country amid the sights and sounds 
which are so dear to the poet's heart. In a 
letter written to Mr. R. H. Home, the author 
of the epic " Orion," for which Edgar Allan

Poe had so pronounced an admiration, she gives 
an account of these youthful days. 

" All this time, and indeed the greater part of my life, 
we lived at Hope End, a few miles from Malvern, in a 
retirement scarcely broken to me except by books and 
my own thoughts; and it is a beautiful country, and was 
a retirement happy in many ways, although the very 
peace of it troubles the heart as it looks back. There I 
had my fits of Pope, and Byron, and Coleridge, and read 
Greek as hard under the trees as some of your Oxonians 
in the Bodleian; gathered visions from Plato and the 
dramatists, and ate and drank Greek and made my head 
ache with it. Do you know the Malvern Hills ? The 
hills of Piers Plowman's Visions ? They seem to me my 
native hills; for, although I was born in the county of 
Durham, I was an infant when I went first into their 
neighborhood, and lived there until I had passed twenty 
by several years. Beautiful, beautiful hills they are ! 
And yet, not for the whole world's beauty would I stand 
in the sunshine and the shadow of them any more. It 
would be a mockery, like the taking back of a broken 
flower to its stalk." 

The translation of this passage into elaborate 
verse may be read in " Aurora Leigh." She 
studied Greek assiduously, and read the Greek 
Christian Fathers with the blind scholar, Hugh 
Stuart Boyd, whose friendship she commemo- 
rates in her poem, " Wine of Cyprus." The 
poems published during this period were purely 
tentative, and received scant recognition from 
her in her after years. Of her translation of 
the "Prometheus," published in 1832, she says 
that it was written " in twelve days and 
should have been thrown into the fire after- 
wards the only means of giving it a little 
warmth." The translation to be found in her 
works is a later and more mature version. 

In 1835 the family moved to London, and 
although the health of the poetess was at first 
extremely precarious, and the London atmos- 
phere was never favorable to her physical well- 
being, yet the genuine career of Mrs. Browning 
dates from this time. Her life-long friendship 
with Mr. John Kenyon and Miss Mitford of 
41 Our Village " and " Rienzi " fame begins ; her 
poems appear in the magazines, her debut being 
made with the " Romaunt of Margaret " in the 
"New Monthly Magazine," then edited by Bul- 
wer Lytton ; and she is preparing for the pub- 
lication of her first important volume. She is 
brought into relation with the distinguished men 
and women of the day. Here is her account of 
her meeting with Wordsworth : 

" No ! I was not at all disappointed in Wordsworth, 
although perhaps I should not have singled him from 
the multitude as a great man. There is a reserve even 
in his countenance, which does not lighten as Landor's 
does, whom I saw the same evening. His eyes have 
more meekness than brilliancy; and in his slow even 
articulation there is rather the solemnity and calmness 



of truth itself, than the animation and energy of those 
who seek for it. As to my being quite at my ease when 
I spoke to him, why, how could you ask such a question ? 
I trembled both in my soul and body." 

At length her volume, " The Seraphim and 
other Poems," appears. Its reception did credit 
to its own merits and the critics who reviewed 
it. The charges of obscurity, mysticism, and 
affectation were brought against her, and in one 
of her letters to Miss Mitford is found the fol- 
lowing allusion to them : 

" But don't believe him no! don't believe even 
Mr. Kenyon whenever he says that I am perversely 
obscure. Unfortunately obscure, not perversely that 
is quite a wrong word. And the last time he used it to 
me (and then, I assure you, another word still worse 
was with it) I begged him to confine them for the 
future to his jesting moods. Because, indeed, I am not 
in the very least degree perverse in this fault of mine, 
which is my destiny rather than my choice, and comes 
upon me, I think, just where I would eschew it most. 
So little has perversity to do with its occurrence, that 
my fear of it makes me sometimes feel quite nervous 
and thought-tied in composition. . . ." 

During the immediately succeeding years, 
her creative faculty is greatly stimulated, and 
some of her noblest poems are produced. Her 
papers on the Greek Christian poets and En- 
glish poets saw the light in the " Athena3um." 
Then in 1844 came her two volumes of "Poems" 
and her place among the foremost of living 
writers was assured. Tennyson had already 
published the best of his earlier poems ; Brown- 
ing had issued his " Bells and Pomegranates "; 
a new generation of poets had fairly won their 
recognition and right to be heard. " Lady 
Geraldine's Courtship " proved the popular 
poem in these volumes. Of it Mrs. Browning 
says: 

" Oh, and I think I told you, when giving you the 
history of ' Lady Geraldine's Courtship,' that I wrote 
the thirteen last pages of it in one day. I ought to have 
said nineteen pages instead. But don't tell anybody; 
only keep the circumstance in your mind when you read 
it and see the faults." 

It is now also that the friendship with Mrs. 
Jameson commences. 

There is little need of repeating the circum- 
stances attendant upon the acquaintance of 
Robert Browning with the woman who subse- 
quently took her destiny into her own hands 
and became his wife. The father of Mrs. 
Browning could not, it appears, contemplate 
with equanimity auy separation from his chil- 
dren, and he objected as strenuously to the later 
marriages of Mrs. Browning's sister and brother 
as he did to her own. Mrs. Browning's health, 
however, imperatively called for a change of 
climate, and the journey to Italy proceeded,.

and the residence in Florence began. The 
change for Mrs. Browning meant everything, 
release from nunlike seclusion, renewed physi- 
cal health, incomparable companionship, mix- 
ture with the great life of the world. Her 
mind and heart take on a more healthful tone ; 
her mysticism, while never relinquishing its 
elevation, becomes a deep sympathy with the 
struggle for liberty which she beholds around 
her ; her poetry gains in breadth, in simplicity, 
in humanity. In the letters of this time we 
find the prose version of the " Sonnets from 
the Portuguese." 

It is five years before the Brownings see 
England again. In the meantime Casa Guidi 
becomes a place to which visitors look with 
eager eyes. It was there that the son was born 
who made a new light in his mother's eyes. 
The letters are full of accounts of guests from 
England, from France, from America. Mrs. 
Browning is drawn to Margaret Fuller, already 
the Countess D'Ossoli. America and the 
Brownings recognized their kinship from the 
first. Powers, Story, Ware, Hillard, Harriet 
Hosmer, Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, 
belong of right to this circle. 

In 1851 they are back in Paris. Mr. Brown- 
ing's view of Louis Napoleon we have in his 
full-length portrait of " Prince Hohenstheil- 
Schwangau "; Mrs. Browning's we know from 
her resounding ode, " Napoleon III. in Italy." 
The comment of Mr. Swinburne in one of his 
poems may be remembered : 

" How shall the spirit be loyal 

To the shell of a spiritless thing? 
Erred once in only a word, 
The sweet great song that we heard 
Poured npon Tuscany, erred, 
Galling a crowned man royal 

That was no more than a King." 

She had not as yet placed Napoleon III. on 
the pinnacle to which she afterwards raised 
him, but she always put a favorable construc- 
tion upon his actions. Thus, she says of the 
coup d'etat: 

" For my own part I have not only more hope in the 
situation but more faith in the French people than is 
ordinary among the English, who really try to exceed 
one another in discoloration and distortion of the cir- 
cumstances. The government was in a dead lock 
what was to be done ? Yes, all parties cried out, 
' What was to be done ? ' and felt that we were waist 
deep a fortnight ago in a state of crisis. In throwing 
back the sovereignty from a ' representative assembly ' 
which had virtually ceased to represent, into the hands 
of the people, I think that Louis Napoleon did well. 
The talk about ' military despotism ' is absolute non- 
sense." 

Here is an account of her meeting with 



George Sand. The account is too long to be 
given entire, and we have room only for a few 
sentences. 

" She received us very kindly, with hand stretched out, 
which I, with a natural emotion (I assure you), stooped 
and kissed, when she said quickly, " Mais non, je ne veux 
pas," and kissed my lips. She is large for her height 
not tall. . . . There is no sweetness in the face, but 
great moral as well as intellectual capacities only it 
never could have been a beautiful face, which a good deal 
surprised me. . . . She seemed to be, in fact, the man 
in that company, and the profound respect with which 
she was listened to a good deal impressed me." 

This is what she says of Carlyle : 
" Carlyle, for instance, I liked infinitely more in his 
personality than I expected to like him, and I saw a 
great deal of him, for he travelled with us to Paris and 
spent several evenings with us, we three together. He 
is one of the most interesting men I could imagine even, 
deeply interesting to me; and you come to understand 
perfectly, when you know him, that his bitterness is only 
melancholy, and his scorn sensibility. Highly pictur- 
esque too he is in conversation. The talk of writing men 
is very seldom as good." 

The circle of her life constantly widens and 
deepens ; the interest in the European ferment 
intensifies. The letters reflect it all : her burn- 
ing sympathies with those whom she feels to be 
wronged ; her hopes and aspirations ; her en- 
larging intimacies. All Europe is represented : 
Lamartine, Cavour, Mazzini, D'Azeglio, De 
Musset, Kingsley, Landor, George Eliot, Rus- 
kin, the catalogue can be indefinitely extended. 

As early as the publication of the volume con- 
taining " Lady Geraldine's Courtship" she had 
been contemplating the writing of what she 
called a " novel in verse." She considered the 
" Courtship " an effort of that kind. At length 
in the maturity of her powers she accomplished 
her self-ordained task and gives to the world her 
" Aurora Leigh." With much of that book 
these letters should be read : the poetry and the 
prose of her life may be set side by side ; and 
sometimes the latter exceeds the former. 

The last years added little to the poems pre- 
viously published. The roar of our Civil Con- 
flict came to her across the waters ; she heard 
it with dismay, but hoped for the best. The 
frail strand of her life had been growing thinner 
and thinner ; it parted, and the end came. We 
gave near the beginning of this article a quota- 
tion from " Aurora Leigh " relating to poetry; 
we close with another on a kindred theme taken 
from a letter to Mr. Chorley : "Art is not 
either all beauty or all use, it is essential truth 
which makes its way through beauty into use." 
It was in the light of this conception that the 
days of Elizabeth Barrett Browning were passed, 
and that her work was done.

FRANCE PREPARING FOR THE 
REVOLUTION.* 



The most striking fact in the history of 
France in the eighteenth century is the antag- 
onism that existed between the institutions of 
the Ancient Regime and new ideas ; although 
nothing was essentially changed from 1715 to 
1789. The crown owed its force not to any 
constitution or contract with the nation, but to 
the survival of Roman ideas and a long series 
of encroachments. It was absolute in law, 
though practically hampered by privilege and 
custom. The administrative confusion was 
prodigious, the administrative organization 
being derived from three different sources : the 
feudal epoch, of which a heterogeneous array 
of institutions remained ; the fifteenth and 
sixteenth centuries, in which period the great 
offices were created ; the seventeenth century, 
which saw the formation of a vast bureau- 
cracy of ministers and agents. These three 
regimes, instead of succeeding each other, had 
been superimposed. As a result, the system 
was a complex crisscross of conflicting and 
concurrent jurisdictions, ecclesiastical, feudal, 
royal. At the head of the government were 
the councils, dating from the time of Louis 
XIV.; the chancellor, the contrbtteur- general, 
and four secretaries of state, each of whom had 
charge not only of the special matters of his 
office but also had general supervision of cer- 
tain provinces. Thus the minister of war con- 
trolled Dauphine ; the minister of foreign affairs 
regulated pensions. The oldest administrative 
divisions were those of the Church. Over these 
had developed the grand historic provinces like 
Burgundy and Anjou, which were divided into 
two sorts pays d'etat, provinces that retained 
a measure of local life and pays Selection 
provinces that were at the mercy of the crown. 
Then there were thirty-eight military govern- 
ments, besides those of Lorraine and Corsica, 
and four generalites under intendants ; thirty- 
four recruiting districts, and numerous judicial 
districts. All this complicated machinery looked

to the central government for its mechanical 
direction, with the result that local life was 
stifled. The third estate bore almost the whole 
expense of the government. Direct taxes were 
levied, but the wealthy and noble evaded them. 
The taille, a direct tax, fell upon the masses of 
the people. Both clergy and nobles evaded the 
capitation tax, which was permanent after 1701. 
The most hated indirect tax was that upon salt. 
Certain others, like the corvee, did not involve 
the privileged classes. The system of collec- 
tion was the old and detestable Roman system 
of farming the taxes. In spite of the great 
effort at codification during the reign of Louis 
XIV., the variety of law was very great. The 
mediaeval distinction between the written or 
Roman Law and customary law still prevailed. 
The penal code was very rigorous, the procedure 
complicated and costly ; individual liberty was 
continually menaced by arbitrary imprison- 
ment. The social inequality, probably inevita- 
ble with every highly civilized people, in France 
was excessive. The privileged classes were the 
clergy and the nobility. The clergy were pos- 
sessed of immense wealth, and its high repre- 
sentatives, archbishops and bishops, were veri- 
table princes in the cloth. On the other hand, 
the lesser clergy, like the country cures, were 
extremely miserable ; and it is not surprising 
that the Revolution enjoyed the support of this 
class. The nobles were second only to the clergy 
in point of wealth, and surpassed them in the 
possession of sinecures. Instead of forming in 
the centre of the state an enlightened aristocracy 
like the English nobility, they were completely 
useless. The third estate was practically divided 
into two classes, the wealthy bourgeois of the 
cities and the peasant of the fields. The former 
by commerce and industry had raised them- 
selves to place if not to privilege, in spite of 
the fact that they had to pay exorbitant taxes 
and that commerce was impaired by special 
duties and internal tariffs, and industry was 
embarrassed by the guild system, an organiza- 
tion which, while good and useful in the middle 
age, was in the eighteenth century a positive 
detriment to free production. But the vast 
mass of the people were far below this more 
fortunate few. The peasants were overwhelmed 
by taxes of the government, the church, and 
the noble. 

It was this condition of France that led 
Michelet to declare that the absolute monarchy 
of France, which supplanted the violence and 
private war of the feudal epoch, was attended 
with more injury to humanity than the feudal

regime itself, but a more modern scholarship 
has learned to avoid such generalizations and 
to distrust absolute values in history. Mr. 
James Breck Perkins's latest work, " France 
under Louis XV.," is an example of this cau- 
tious, scholarly spirit. Carlyle's Louis XV., 
" whose whole existence seems one hideous abor- 
tion and mistake of nature," when reduced even 
to his lowest terms, appears not as an error of 
nature, but as the product of a wrong civiliza- 
tion. Louis XV. was originally a man of easy 
temperament and naturally good judgment, but 
he was indolent and weak-willed, a fact that 
led him to follow the line of least resistance. 
Birth and training made him unable to distin- 
guish between will and self-will, between the 
right of his wishes and the privilege of another. 
Indolence made him indifferent to the vice of a 
highly-wrought and artificial civilization, and 
created an eager craving for new sensations which 
led him into depths of vileness that parallelled 
the declining days of the Roman Empire. The 
end of the reign of Louis XIV. seemed the utter 
prostration of France ; and yet industry and 
commerce under his successor experienced a 
revival. The latter, in spite of absurd regula- 
tions, was prosperous down to the Revolution. 
The peasant, however, remained very miserable. 
The barriers to the free circulation of grain, 
which Turgot attempted in vain to break down, 
stifled agriculture and produced famine. Never- 
theless France managed to live, and even to 
improve, in the time of Louis XV. Under 
Fleury, there was actually a surplus of fifteen 
millions. Mr. Perkins has warm words of 
praise for Fleury, whose real work for France 
seems to have been lost sight of in the splendor 
of Versailles. 

" The improved condition of the national finances 
under Fleury had a beneficial effect on business, but the 
country owed to him a still greater boon. The coinage 
was at last established on an immovable basis, and this 
measure did more to accelerate the increase of wealth 
and the development of industry than all the commercial 
codes at which Colbert so earnestly labored. For the 
first time in French history, the country enjoyed during 
a long period an unchanged standard of value. As it 
had been fixed, so it remained. . . . By the end of 
Fleury's long administration, the financial principles 
adopted by him had taken root. Business had improved 
and national income increased. . . . Freed from the 
uncertainties which had threatened them, French trade 
and commerce developed with greater rapidity than at 
any time in the history of the past." (Vol. I., pp. 91-3.) 

Just at this point comes in the exceeding 
value of Mr. Perkins's work. The occasion 
of the French Revolution, it is admitted, was 
the great and ever increasing deficit ; but the 
cause of that increase Mr. Perkins attributes 



not so much to the drain of the court, as Taine 
would have us believe, but to the enormous 
treasure expended in unsuccessful war, which 
ruined the state and diminished its prestige. 
In the two years prior to the war of the Austrian 
Succession there was an annual surplus of 
fifteen millions, " a phenomenon which was not 
again witnessed under the old regime" (p. 91). 
Mr. Perkins looks at facts with level eyes ; and 
his judgment of conditions that prevailed in 
France under the old regime, as compared with 
contemporary history, will arrest attention. 

" The embarrassed condition of the national finances 
was not altogether due to excessive expenditure. Cer- 
tainly there was great opportunity for retrenchment, yet 
the expenses of the government under the old re'gime 
were not greater than the country was able to bear ; it 
is doubtful whether the monarchical establishment was 
any more costly than the democratic institutions by which 
it has been succeeded. Wars were more frequent in the 
last century than in this, but while they lasted longer 
they cost less, and the expense of the army in times of 
peace was small in comparison with the sums now ex- 
pended by most European nations. Two million livres 
a year would perhaps represent the sums annually paid 
in pensions to the aristocracy. . . . Such extravagance 
can justly be condemned, yet it is equaled by the salaries 
of an excessive number of minor officials in the present 
French government and is far exceeded by the pension 
list of the United States.* It may, indeed, be said that 
the sums thus expended in our own day benefit larger 
numbers, while those paid out under the old re'gime 
profited only a small class ; and yet, considered as a 
burden on the national wealth, it is questionable if the 
cost of government absorbed any larger proportion of 
the resources of the government." (Vol. L, pp. 32-3, 
cf. p. 41.) 

The truth is that the conditions that pre- 
vailed in France in the eighteenth century were 
not so hard as those in other states of Europe. 
How, then, is the revolutionary tendency that 
was so strong in France to be explained? 
French intellect then led Europe. In the 
eighteenth century France was the centre of 
thought. But its literature had experienced a 
change. The transition from the classic liter- 
ature of Louis XIV.'s time to the philosophic 
literature of Louis XV. 's time was fraught 
with significance for France. This philosophic 
thought became especially vital after the junc- 
tion of the French and English intellects. The 
principles of tolerance and political liberty de- 
rived from England were made known to the 
French with marvellous clearness by Voltaire 
and Montesquieu, who were, however, reformers, 
and not revolutionists like Rousseau. At the 
same time, the economists demanded liberty for 
labor and the abolition of the guilds. These 
ideas penetrated all classes. They were taken

up with applause by a society highly wrought, 
sentimental, and seeking excitement. Their 
seed took root in the breasts of the third estate, 
where they were nourished by the wrongs under 
which they suffered, to become at last the symp- 
toms of a revolution unique in history. For the 
enthusiasm of the reformers was parallelled only 
by the unpractical character of their teachings. 
Moreover, the bent of thought in the eighteenth 
century was wholly negative. At first directed 
against the church, about 1750 its point of 
attack changed to the state. Absolutism was 
reaping its reward. Since the government 
monopolized all rights, it was held responsible 
for everything, and every opposition to the 
government was considered laudable. This 
negative character ultimately penetrated into 
purely scientific thought as well. Condillac 
deduced pure sensationalism in mental philoso- 
phy ; Helvetius followed the idea into the moral 
sphere and denied immortality to the soul and 
belief in God. 

But Mr. Perkins has not confined his re- 
searches entirely to a study of the structure and 
character of the old regime, but has endeav- 
ored to unravel the tangled thread of European 
politics in the eighteenth century. The following 
of that thread, however, is a matter of greater 
interest to the professional historian than to the 
casual reader. Mr. Perkins's volumes are the 
most authoritative attempt yet made to present to 
English readers the history of the reign of Louis 
XV. and the Pompadour. In matter of style, 
some of the author's sentences are cameo-like in 
definiteness and precision. Take this sentence, 
illustrating the distinction between the great 
and the small nobility : 

" The country gentlemen were embarrassed because 
their receipts were so small, and the great nobles were 
bankrupt because their expenditures were so large." 

And could any antithesis be more pointed than 
this ? 

" Louis XIV. never abandoned the endeavor to rule 
his kingdom himself; but Louis XV. did not even make 
the attempt." 

No reader agrees with his author in every 
opinion, and one is inclined to take exception 
to the statement that " It neeeded no prophet 
to discern that institutions which seemed as 
firmly rooted as those of theMedes and Persians 
when Louis XIV. was proclaimed the Great, 
were nearing their end when Louis XV. lay on 
his death-bed " (Vol. I., p. 1), since even so 
keen a statesman as Frederick the Great, who 
died in 1786, did not foresee the Revolution. 
And parenthetically, apropos of the oriental 



illusion in the quotation above, may we not pro- 
test against a whole procession of ancient and 
oriental dynasties ? Is there a cumulative force 
in comparing the French Monarchy to that of 
the Medes and Persians, the czar of Russia, the 
sultan of Morocco, " Assyrian and Babylonian 
kings," and " an Assyrian or Egyptian sove- 
reign," all in the space of nine pages ? Else- 
where Mr. Perkins, in speaking of the fact that 
the French have never succeeded in giving 
coincident and due expression to central and 
local constitutional forces, says of the provincial 
states prior to '89 : 

" They might have furnished a nucleus for the develop- 
ment of legislative bodies, somewhat akin to the legisla- 
tures of the American States, but the tendency of politi- 
cal change in France was not in that direction; in the 
discussions of the eighteenth century there was little 
demand for any local subdivision of political action; the 
most ardent republican of the Convention was as eager 
an advocate of centralization as Richelieu or Louis XlV." 
(Vol. I., p. 21.) 

The statement is too strong. The reform ideas 
of Turgot looked to the development of local 
life ; exaggerated local power in the hands of 
44,000 communes was one of the defects of the 
constitution of 1791 ; moreover, Brissot, who 
had been in America, and his following in the 
Girondist party, were French federalists. 

Finally, however, be it said of Mr. Perkins 
that few writers could so successfully have 
avoided the errors and pitfalls for the historian 
of so complex politics and civilization as that of 
France in the eighteenth century, or carried 
the work to such successful completion.

THE SCHOLAR AND THE STATE.* 

One of the most marked features of the pro- 
gress of the last twenty years has been the socializ- 
ing of the Christian ministry. A generation ago 
the normal clergyman was not more noticeable 
by reason of his garb and his phraseology than 
by reason of his peculiar outlook upon the 
affairs of the society in which he lived. His 
teaching was theological and doctrinal ; his 
atmosphere was traditional and conservative ; 
and his exegesis was largely by way of com- 
mentary on what had already been said by 
fathers, reformers, and more recent divines. 
Authority to him was paramount, and his City 
of God stood, like the ark of Noah, somewhat

apart from the larger world of struggling mor- 
tals. He did not mix himself up with the secu- 
lar questions of the day, and if he did cast his 
vote at elections he had at any rate forgotten 
that his ecclesiastical ancestors a hundred years 
earlier preached election sermons and shaped 
affairs of state. 

The present generation has seen this clerical 
character move into a larger field in two direc- 
tions. On the one hand he has broken some- 
what with the authority that he once held to be 
an adequate reason, and with " Ian Maclaren " 
has harked back to " the Mind of the Master." 
The famous " Scotch Sermons of 1880 " showed 
that he had awakened to his own individuality. 
Dr. Newman Smyth had the year before re- 
vealed to him " Old Faiths in New Lights." 
On the other hand, in 1889 that noblest prelate 
of the most unprogressive church in Christen- 
dom, Cardinal Gibbons, had set a grand example 
in that great work on " Our Christian Herit- 
age " which breathes not one word of denomi- 
national teaching, but only the spirit of Christ 
the Savior of society ; and about the same time 
his suffragan bishop of our own state Bishop 
Spalding of Peoria had brought together as 
co-workers for humanity " Culture and the 
Higher Life." 

The enfranchisement of clerical thought from 
the too dominant rule of pure dogmatic and 
polemic was thus begun, and the social duty of 
the ministry was reemphasized ; and just now 
we have had along the one line Dr. Watson's 
" Mind of the Master," Dr. Amory H. Brad- 
ford's " The Growing Revelation," and Presi- 
dent Hyde's " Social Theology." In the other 
line we place the book which is the subject 
of this review " The Scholar and the State," 
by the Episcopalian bishop of New York. Dr. 
Potter has been a man of affairs, and has 
shown himself to be imbued with the largest and 
most generous statesmanship for many years. 
He has done well to collect under one cover 
these essays and orations of the past ten years, 
through all of which runs the thought of the 
responsibility of Christian and educated man- 
hood to our country and our people. A bishop 
was intended to be " an overlooker " for the 
lives and souls of men ; and the author of these 
papers has not come short of his calling, either 
in his life or in his utterances. In his essays 
concerning the scholar and the Christian in his 
relation to the state, to service, to the criminal, to 
statesmanship, to American life, the keynote of 
his thought is insight and illumination rather 
than knowledge and mere culture as the goal of 



all acquisition. Learning, attainment, accom- 
plishment, riches, material and mental, are a 
trust for the society which has made all acqui- 
sition possible, and which needs its upper 
classes of mind and of capital as much as it 
needs its humbler workers. 

In the discussion of " Christianity and the 
Criminal," " A Phase of Social Science," and 
"The Gospel for Wealth," Bishop Potter speaks 
strong words on the failure of our Christian 
society to do its duty by the delinquent and de- 
fective classes, swinging as it does from namby- 
pamby sentimentalism to unconscious, but none 
the less pagan, brutality. The absurdity, to 
say nothing of the inhumanity, of our apology 
for a corrective system is not more severely 
characterized than is the immorality of our 
ostrich-like method of obliterating suffering by 
bribing it to take its countenance away from 
our doorstep, or the anti-Christian attitude of 
a civilization that turns its back and shuts its 
door forever upon a woman who has fallen 
fallen by the grace of man. 

In "The Higher Uses of an Exposition," 
published in " The Forum " just before the 
opening of our World's Fair, a fearless word 
is spoken for the beneficent and refining and 
sanctifying influences of art and of all the 
products of man's genius, and a solid middle 
ground is taken between the extremists who 
would that all others might be made to do as 
they do on the one hand, and those on the other 
who would run a wide-open Sunday for the 
benefit of all the sins of the flesh. Along the 
same line of the educative value of the beautiful 
is the plea for the symbolism of religion in 
"The Significance of the American Cathedral," 
and the protest against that growing conception 
of the Church as consisting " mainly of a huge 
auditorium with a platform and a more or less 
dramatic performer and a congregational par- 
lor, and a parish kitchen." For it is well to 
recognize " that religion has never survived 
anywhere without the due recognition and con- 
servation of the instinct of worship." Finally, 
in the memorial sermon occasioned by the death 
of Phillips Brooks, entitled " The Life-Giving 
Word," is summed up the character of man 
that must make the life which the Master re- 
vealed eighteen hundred years ago the basis of 
modern society." 

" There is a life nobler and diviner than any that 
we have dreamed of. To the poorest and meanest of us, 
as to the best and most richly dowered, it is alike open. 
To turn toward it, to long for it, to reach up after it, 
to believe in its ever-recurring nearness, and to glorify 
God in attaining it, this is the calling of a human soul !

NIPPTJR, AXD ITS OLD BRICKS.* 

The large-hearted and benevolent members 
of the Archaeological Association of Philadel- 
phia have won the gratitude and admiration of 
the scientific world. Their inspiration and 
offerings have opened the treasure-tombs of 
Babylonia and transferred to the museums of 
oriental antiquities some of the choicest relics 
of primitive civilizations. Under the auspices 
of this Association, Dr. Peters organized and 
prosecuted, in the face of untold difficulties, 
two campaigns into the heart of old Babylonia. 
In June of 1888 he set out on his first expedi- 
tion with a staff of helpers, assyriologists, inter- 
preter, surveyor, etc., to search for remains of 
old Babylonian empires. He paints in vivid 
colors the extreme annoyances and embarrass- 
ments faced in the organization of the expedi- 
tion, in the securing of a firman from the 
Turkish authorities, and after being granted 
the concession, the continuous and perplexing 
and treacherous chicanery of the local author- 
ities in trying to thwart his plans. Some 
months of time were lost in the aggravating 
delays caused by the Sultan's too-well-trained 
officials. On December 1, 1888, about six 
months after leaving New York, the Director 
left Constantinople. The members of the ex- 
pedition soon met, and proceeded, almost as an 
ancient oriental caravan, across Syria to the 
Euphrates, thence down that old stream to 
Baghdad. Aside from a few mishaps, the only 
notable discovery was what the Director calls

"Tiphsah" (Chapter IV.). From Baghdad 
through devious ways they wend their march to 
Nippur, the site which had been selected for 
excavation. This mound is located about one 
hundred miles east of south from Baghdad, and 
is adjacent to the bed of the old Shatt-en-Nil 
canal. Only the most refined patience and the 
best-trained self-control could have endured 
the contemptible parasitic demands of local 
officials and their subalterns. 

On February 1, the expedition began to erect 
a permanent camp on the summit of Nippur. 
About thirty diggers were soon set to work, 
and these gradually increased, through the de- 
mand of local sheikhs, to a hundred and fifty. 
Trenches were cut in several places, and work 
was carried on simultaneously in the different 
localities. There was anything, however, but 
peace in the camp. Bands of wandering Arabs 
loitered about, begged, stole, and kept the camp 
in a sort of smoking-volcano condition. The 
antiquities discovered were meagre, some of 
them of great value for their age, others of 
slight importance for their modernness. Enough 
had been done to demonstrate that the mound 
covered old and valuable ruins. But the jar- 
ring and jangling and thieving of the Arabs 
grew more and more daring and violent, until 
at 2 A. M. of Monday, April 15, 1889, the bomb 
was lighted by a guard shooting a thief. This 
aroused tribe after tribe for blood revenge, 
until by Thursday, April 18, as the expedition 
was preparing to retreat, treachery set fire to 
their camp, and in five minutes it lay in ruins, 
including three fine horses. Many small val- 
uables, including a bag of gold, had been pur- 
loined by the omnipresent thieves. Only by 
shrewdness and agility were the members of the 
expedition able to escape to boats which carried 
them to Hillah, thence to Baghdad. The Direc- 
tor at this point says (p. 288) : 

" Our first year at Nippur had ended in failure and 
disaster. I had failed to win the confidence of my com- 
rades. None of them agreed with me in my belief in 
the importance of Nippur, and the desirability of exca- 
vating down to the foundations. The Arabs had proved 
treacherous. The Turkish authorities disbelieved our 
story of Arab treachery, and suspected us of plotting 
with our Turkish commissioner to carry away antiqui- 
ties. I was sick and nervous, having suffered for two 
months almost incessantly from severe facial neuralgia 
and consequent sleeplessness." 

To add another weight to the scale, all the mem- 
bers of the expedition resigned before Baghdad 
was reached. Thus apparently the first cam- 
paign terminated in a disaster and a catastrophe.

of 1889-90, which was conducted with fewer 
experts, under less difficulties, and with the 
benefit of the varied experiences of the first 
year. The superstition of the natives was used 
by the Director to a fine advantage in showing 
them that their (the natives') ill fate in the face 
of the late cholera scourge was due to their ill 
treatment of the first campaign. This secured 
almost unmolested continuity in carrying on 
excavations. Three-quarters of this volume 
sets forth the marvellous areha3ological signifi- 
cance of this campaign. Instead of four boxes 
of antiquities secured in 1889, this campaign 
packed and shipped thirty-six, besides a coffin 
and a half-dozen door sockets. These boxes 
contained eight to ten thousand inscribed tablets 
or fragments of tablets, and several hundred 
inscribed stones and stone fragments, among 
which were the oldest inscriptions theretofore 
discovered in Babylonia. The foundations of 
what they termed " the oldest temple in the 
world " were laid bare. The complete plan 
and character of this is fully described, and the 
inscriptions found in and about its walls tell us 
that it was a powerful institution at about 
4000 B.C. The bricks of Ur-Gur and Bur-Sin 
2800 B.C. were found in its upper walls. The 
court of columns was another precious archi- 
tectural find, where they discovered round col- 
umns resting on square bases. Many important 
inscriptions from the Gossan dynasty of the 
thirteenth century B.C. were brought to light. 
In fact, the entire campaign seems to have been 
conducted on a shrewd, wise basis, and to have 
yielded large results for times antedating 
Abraham by 1,500 to 2,000 years. 

The story is told in a simple, clear, and vivid 
manner, much of it giving us the day and often 
the hour of the occurrence of the events. The 
volumes are admirably illustrated with half- 
tones of the monuments, of mounds, and of 
personages connected with the campaigns. The 
vividness of delineation is greatly enhanced 
by detailed plans of the hill Nippur, and of the 
foundations which were uncovered. Volume I. 
has a valuable appendix from Dr. William 
Hayes Ward's diary of the Wolfe expedition 
in 1885 ; and Volume II. has another of twelve 
plates of objects found, which will be of unusual 
interest to scholars. 

The Director of the expedition is to be con- 
gratulated on the persistency and pluck with 
which he has executed his plans, and on the 
issuance of these beautiful and valuable vol- 
umes. They are gems of the bookmaker's art.

THE DIAL

a mere narrative of exciting adventure. In point 
of style, both fragments are in the rich manner of 
the author's later years, and each of them may be 
read with lingering delight. " St. Ives," moreover, 
turns out to be much more of a book than we had 
expected, for Stevenson's work does not break off 
until the three-hundredth page is well passed, and 
the pattern of the whole so well marked out that 
one might imagine most of what was left untold, 
without the friendly offices of Mr. Quiller-Couch, 
who has undertaken the delicate task of supplying 
the closing six chapters. The romance is of thrill- 
ing interest, combining, as it does, the adventures 
of a French prisoner escaped from the Castle of 
Edinburgh with a highly satisfactory sort of love- 
story. Those who are fanatical in their devotion 
to Stevenson's memory will probably resent the in- 
trusion of an alien hand at the close, but for our 
part, we must express our gratitude to the distin- 
guished writer upon whom has devolved the some- 
what thankless labor of working out the author's 
conception. Mr. Quiller-Couch has a very pretty 
style of his own, and if he indulge at times in a 
certain extravagance or whimsicality of invention, 
he has on the whole done his work admirably, and 
we have no quarrel with him for having failed to 
attain the impossible. 

One approaches " The Christian " with a certain 
prejudice against it, based partly upon the self- 
advertising methods of its author, and partly upon 
the morbid sentimentalism and tawdry rhetoric that 
are sure to be found in his work. It is something 
of a relief, then, to discover that the book is not 
nearly as bad as might have been expected, and that 
its very obvious defects do not deprive it of the 
power both to interest and to stir its readers. This 
power belongs to the theme quite as much as to the 
execution, for the professional moralist, whether in 
orders or not, can always make an effective appeal 
to his hearers by contrasting the Christianity of 
the New Testament with the parody that mostly 
takes its place in modern society. Now Mr. Caine 
writes primarily as a moralist, and there is no mis- 
taking the fervor of his conviction that modern 
society is rotten to the core. The unfortunate thing 
about his performance is that it knows not the virtue 
of restraint ; that it becomes vehement and even 
hysterical, and thus half defeats its purpose. Think 
of Dr. Ibsen's Brand, from which all such figures 
as Mr. Caine's Christian derive, and the difference 
between art and journeyman-work becomes apparent 
enough. And then Mr. Caine's hero is only a Brand 
manqu6, which makes another big difference. But 
in spite of his vacillation, he interests us, and we 
follow his tempestuous career with a certain amount 
of sympathy, although not as much as the author 
would evidently have us accord the subject. To run 
amuck through society, as John Storm sees fit to do, 
is not likely to result in reforming the world, and 
the way of Erasmus is usually better than the way 
of Luther. As for Glory, the heroine, she would 
be a nice girl if she had another name, and could 



have cultivated a less affected style of letter-writing. 

Books in the new-old fashion of romantic histor- 
ical fiction are so much of a piece that when we 
have stated the period and the chief historical char- 
acters with which such a work is concerned there 
seems little or nothing more to say, as the machinery 
and the trappings may easily be left for granted. 
Mr. S. Levett Yeats, in " The Chevalier d'Auriac," 
writes of the last stand of the League, of Henry of 
Navarre, and the Duke of Sully. He has a love 
story of the approved conventional type, a series of 
desperate adventures and escapes, and the usual 
swaggering hero. In the authorship of such a ro- 
mance there is hardly a trace of individuality. It is 
all done to pattern, and the name on the titlepage 
might be that of Mr. Weyman, or Dr. Doyle, just 
about as well as the name that we actually find there. 

" The Fall of a Star " is the story of a crime, of 
the criminal's ingenious efforts for concealment, and 
of the clever way in which it is brought home to 
him by a couple of amateur detectives. The hero 
is a very wicked villain indeed, who is also a rising 
English statesman, the hope of a great party. He is 
both a Jekyll and a Hyde, although the two char- 
acters are blended (except in one scene) instead of 
being sharply differentiated. The story is not ex- 
actly brilliant, although not without entertaining 
qualities and reasonably exciting chapters. 

"In the Days of Drake" is a short historical 
novel by Mr. J. S. Fletcher, who has done good 
work in this field before, and who has a very pleas- 
ant way of telling his tales. The hero is an English 
lad, kidnapped by a Spaniard, taken to Mexico, and 
given into the tender hands of the Inquisition. He 
is condemned to the galleys, and lives in a floating 
hell until rescued by an English ship, which proves 
to be no other than that in which Drake is making 
the first circumnavigation of the globe. Thus our 
youth becomes a part of that glorious emprise, and 
when he returns to the home that had long mourned 
him for dead, soon sets matters to right, both with 
his sweetheart and with the villain who had sought 
to compass his destruction. 

" His Majesty's Greatest Subject " is a historical 
romance of the future instead of the past. It pre- 
tends to be the story, revealed after his death, of 
the man who, early in the twentieth century, saves 
a revolted British India to the Empire. He does 
it by taking the place and character of his twin- 
brother the Viceroy (who has died suddenly), cut- 
ting off cable communication with the rest of the 
world, and then proceeding to suppress the revolt 
in his own way, at the same time pacifying the na- 
tives by a series of administrative reforms. The 
story has a real lesson for the English statesman, 
the lesson that Mr. Kipling has done so much to 
emphasize. It is that the government of India 
should be left to deal with its own problems in its 
own way, unhampered by cabinets and parliament- 
ary commissions. And the merit of the book lies 
in the force with which this message is conveyed, 
and the evident wide acquaintance of the author 



284 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



with Indian affairs. The book is hardly literature 
in the most catholic sense of that term, and the 
puerilities of its sentimental passages are such as to 
excite the derision of even the uncritical. 

Mr. Howells has appeared to much better advan- 
tage of late in his shorter stories than in his more 
pretentious novels. There is so much sameness in 
his minutely photographic descriptions of our con- 
temporary society, that, in spite of their shrewd 
humor and sure sympathy, they become wearisome 
after the first hundred pages or so. But an " idyl " 
having the dimensions of " An Open- Eyed Conspi- 
racy," which may be read at one short sitting, 
affords the pleasantest of entertainment, and, despite 
the fact that even when treated within such limits 
the material for the sketch seems scanty, the reader 
is on the whole well rewarded for his attention. 
This story of Saratoga is a very pretty piece of work, 
and we are glad that it has been added to the author's 
studies of commonplace humanity. 

Mr. Bret Harte's new novel does not offer any- 
thing strikingly new either in character or incident. 
He has often entertained us with stories of "strikes " 
in mining-camps, and frontier ruffians of various 
types, and belles of the village developed into fine 
(and faithless) ladies. Jack Hamlin, too, is nearly 
always with us in Mr. Harte's pages, and we are 
seldom deprived of some striking contrast between 
the early privations and the later opulence of the 
principal characters. All these cliches, and others 
equally familiar, reappear in the " form " of " Three 
Partners," and we find them all welcome and of 
perennial interest. The plot of this novel is exceed- 
ingly complicated, and the reader grows breathless 
in his attempt to keep up with the development of 
the narrative ; but the author must be accepted 
upon his own terms, and, with all his obvious faults, 
he remains as fascinating as of old. 

Mr. Samuel Harden Church, the author of a 
popular biography of Cromwell, has essayed to bring 
his hero into a work of fiction, and has produced a 
very readable historical romance of the invasion of 
Ireland by the Parliamentary army in 1649. The 
incidents are all of the stereotyped sort ; the hero 
falls in love with a fair enemy, achieves the difficult 
task of protecting her without failing in his duty 
to the Parliamentary cause, wins her love and is 
duly united to her in wedlock, suffers disgrace in 
the eyes of his General and regains favor by an act 
of bravery, finally passing through the wars un- 
scathed and settling down to his hardly won happi- 
ness. We have read it all many times before, and 
expect to read it many times again with the same 
unflagging interest. The author is a staunch be- 
liever in Cromwell, and stoutly defends the Irish 
campaign and the horrors of Drogheda as justified 
by the circumstances of the war. He is clearly in 
full sympathy with his hero when he represents him 
as speaking in these terms : " Men are already call- 
ing this campaign the Curse of Cromwell. We shall 
have much abuse on that score. The day may come 
when academic statesmen in England will refer 



to this policy as a blunder and a crime. But the 
Lord commanded His captains of old to smite His 
enemies and to slay whole nations ; and verily now, 
even now, Jehovah hath directed our progress to 
the castigation of this people, that they may be re- 
claimed from their errors and their fair land res- 
cued from its disorders." 

The theme of " The Stand-By " is a fine one, but 
the author has elected to treat of it in a spirit which 
goes far to repel sympathy. That the law should 
be both respected and enforced, and that even a bad 
law demands no less consideration than a good law, 
are general propositions to which every candid and 
intelligent mind must assent. But when, as in the 
case of the present novel, an attempt is made to 
enlist our sympathies in behalf of the sanctity of 
law, it is surely a wanton sacrifice of effectiveness 
to make the conflict between law and lawlessness 
centre about a piece of legislation that is offensive 
to all healthy political and social instincts. What 
Mr. Dole has really done in this novel is to merge 
his defence of a great principle into a mere brief 
for the prohibitionist, and our admiration for the 
fine fighting qualities of his hero has all the time to 
contend with a feeling that he might have found a 
far worthier employment for his energies than to 
enlist them on the side of the fanaticism that usually 
characterizes what are oddly enough known as 
"temperance" movements. The narrow attitude 
of the author, in spite of his show of fairness in 
argumentation, is revealed when we find him de- 
fending, not only the enforcement of a bad law (in 
which his position is impregnable), but also the 
retention of the law upon the statute-book. We 
believe firmly in what the surprised New Yorkers of 
a year or two ago learned to call " Eooseveltism," 
but we believe also that the true mission of " Roose- 
veltism " is to open men's eyes to the ill-advised and 
reckless character of a great deal of our meddle- 
some law-making. 

The fabrication of a novel has come to be a very 
easy task for Mr. Marion Crawford. By long years 
of practice at the art, he has provided himself with 
a collection of puppets, characteristically labelled 
and costumed, and standing in orderly array upon 
the shelves of his private cabinet. To produce a 
new book, all that he has to do is to make a judicious 
selection from these figures, touch them up a little, 
perhaps hastily shaping two or three others of the 
same general sort, and arrange the group in some 
pleasing new combination. The result is such a 
book as " Corleone," now before us, or any of the 
other books that are sure to follow as long as the 
industry of the craftsman and the patience of his 
public hold out. We have always thought Mr. 
Crawford's " Saracinesca " books the best of his 
entire output, for, while their characters may hardly 
be called creations, they are faithful studies of an 
interesting series of types, and, what is more to the 
point, of types which no one before Mr. Crawford 
has presented with so much skill, sympathy, and 
inventive resource. The hero of this new book is a 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



Saracinesca, the oldest son of Corona and Sant' 
Ilario, and its theme is the story of his love for a 
Sicilian girl, who is supposed, until the very end of 
the novel, to have come from the Corleone stock 
" the worst blood in all Italy," as we are told with 
somewhat wearisome iteration. It is all the time 
difficult to believe that so pure-souled a heroine 
should have sprung from so corrupt a race, although 
water-lilies do blossom upon the bosom of the 
swamp, and we learn with much relief that she had 
been stolen in infancy, and that her real family is 
above reproach. The story is surprisingly interesting 
in its main episodes, and even the hackneyed tale of 
the priest accused of murder, and unable to defend 
himself because the confessional seals his lips, is 
treated in a fashion at once fresh and dramatic. 
Finally, if one would know the real meaning of the 
sinister word mafia, we cannot do better than refer 
him to this book by a writer who knows the Sicilian 
character as intimately as if to the manner born. 

The surprising versatility of Mr. Paul Leicester 
Ford is once more illustrated by his " Story of an 
Untold Love," which surely has nothing about it to 
suggest his story of " The Great K. and A. Eob- 
bery " or his learned edition of " The New England 
Primer," and little to suggest " The Honorable Peter 
Stirling." It proves to be a very charming and 
delicate piece of fiction, in the form of a diary pri- 
vately kept by the hero, and triumphing so com- 
pletely over the difficulties inherent in that form 
that its choice is amply justified. We cannot, how- 
ever, accept as a probability the central situation of 
the book, for it is impossible to believe that the 
heroine, who had known her lover so intimately in 
childhood, could have failed to recognize him when 
their intercourse was renewed later in life. But 
without this assumption, the story could not have 
existed, so we must be content to take the exception, 
and think no more about it. A more serious prob- 
lem is offered by the conduct of the hero in lending 
his literary talents to his employer, and thereby 
deceiving his friends and the public. The fact 
that this is done for the praiseworthy purpose of 
obtaining money for the payment of a debt of honor 
makes the question one of a delicate casuistry, but 
we cannot hold the hero quite blameless. Nothing 
remains to be said except that the diary in which 
these things are set forth falls by accident into the 
hands of the heroine, and that the untold love is 
thus all told at last, receiving its due reward. 

Several novels dealing with the history of the 
colonial and revolutionary periods have recently 
been published, affording a pleasant indication that 
our writers of fiction are becoming more and more 
cognizant of the fact that they need not leave home 
in search of effective themes. While these books 
(with a single exception) are not remarkable, they 
provide agreeable reading, and should not go un- 
mentioned in such a summary as the present. Colonel 
H. E. Gordon's " Pontiac, Chief of the Ottawas," is 
a tale of the siege of Detroit by that famous leader 
in the year 1763. It is a story of the sort that 



Cooper loved to tell, and has all the incidents and 
characters the scout, the captive maiden, the 
ambush, and the rescue that so appealed to our 
youth. While a story of a somewhat amateurish 
sort, it is not without both interest and excitement. 

Miss Augusta Campbell Watson's " Beyond the 
City Gates " has also something of the amateurish 
quality, although the writer has set her name to 
several earlier books. It is a romance of New York 
in the last days of the seventeenth century, when 
the English government had just replaced the Dutch, 
and Captain Kidd was the terror of the worthy 
burghers. The redoubtable pirate, although he does 
not make a personal appearance in these pages, has 
a good deal of indirect influence upon the plot, 
which concerns a pretty Dutch maiden and her two 
lovers the one a dissolute associate of buccaneers 
and cutthroats, the other a worthy young giant of 
sober mercantile pursuits. The story is a pretty one, 
and virtue properly triumphs in the end, although 
the heroine has some dark hours before the clouds 
roll away from her life. 

" A Soldier of Manhattan " is a romance of the 
war which ended in the capture of Quebec and the 
triumph of England in the New World. Its chief 
excellence is in its depiction of the feelings of rivalry 
between the colonial and British forces, a rivalry 
which, although it did not prevent them from fight- 
ing side by side in opposition to the common enemy, 
foreshadowed clearly enough the time when they 
should be arrayed against one another. This par- 
ticular aspect of the temper of the time seems to be 
presented more clearly than we have hitherto viewed 
it in the romantic fiction dealing with the period in 
question. The book is full of exciting adventure, 
tolerably good fighting, and fairly acceptable ro- 
mantic sentiment. But the author has not risen to 
the occasion offered by the memorable exploit of 
Wolfe, and his description of that epochal engage- 
ment is tame in comparison with what other writers 
notably Mr. Gilbert Parker have made out of it. 

" In Buff and Blue " is a story of the Revolu- 
tionary War, and calls for no further comment than 
the statement that it tells pleasantly enough, but 
with slight spirit or vividness of description, the 
familiar story of the operations about Philadelphia. 
The usual love story is interwoven with the tale of 
battle, and a happy conclusion is in due time reached. 

" A Colonial Free Lance " is a far better book 
than any of the historical novels thus far discussed, 
and in reading it we feel for the first time that the 
trick of such writers as Mr. Stanley Weyman and 
their congeners has been successfully caught, and 
its application transferred to the field of American 
history. Here are indeed a spirited style (although 
far from perfect), a variety of invention, a rapidity of 
movement, and a general brilliancy of execution that 
hold the reader from beginning to end, and give him to 
the American revolutionary struggle the same sort of 
romantic interest that attaches to the story of the 
English Commonwealth or the Napoleonic wars. 

A work of larger dimensions, both material and 



286 



[Nov. 16, 



moral, is offered us in Dr. Mitchell's " Hugh Wynne, 
Free Quaker," which we are inclined to think the 
most important novel of the American Revolution 
thus far written, and which adds a bright spray to 
the author's already considerable collection of lau- 
rels. Dr. Mitchell's literary work always commands 
respect, and this particular work may claim a con- 
siderable measure of admiration as well. The hero 
of the book is a young Philadelphia!! of Quaker 
family, carried away by the hot temper of the time 
from the restraints imposed by his training, and 
finding in active service for his country a finer ideal 
than could be provided by the tradition of non- 
resistance. He becomes estranged from his father, 
achieves for himself an honorable career as a soldier, 
and wins the woman of his love. The historical 
material imbedded in this romance embraces all the 
important happenings from the Stamp Act to York- 
town and the treaty of peace, and is handled in a 
way that evinces both sound scholarship and the 
artistic instinct. Perhaps the finest thing in the 
book is the characterization of the hero's father 
a Quaker of stern and almost fanatical type, and 
a creation of the most unquestionable vigor and vi- 
tality. Although the narrative is without exciting 
effects, and never even verges upon the sensational, 
it is possessed of absorbing interest, and will always 
have an honorable place in American fiction. 

The familiar statement that history repeats itself 
is well illustrated by the author of " Captain Shays," 
a novel of the " critical period " of our history. In 
styling the leader of Shays's Rebellion " a populist 
of 1786," Mr. Rivers has emphasized the fact that 
social discontent is much the same thing in one age 
as in another, and that the demagogue uses in about 
the same way the opportunity offered him by a pe- 
riod of " hard times." As he remarks, " the spirit 
of Daniel Shays still lives in the hearts of some of 
those leaders who are showing the farmers the wrong 
path, and who have nothing in view but their own 
selfish ends." 

Last in this group of historical novels comes " A 
Loyal Traitor," which is a sea story of the War of 
1812. The surprising adventures of the hero will 
appeal to boys of all ages, and, if our credulity is 
sometimes taxed overmuch, we are hardly allowed 
to realize the fact, so swiftly does the narrative move 
from excitement to excitement. The element of fem- 
inine interest is lacking, although the author works 
in a commonplace young woman upon two or three 
occasions, and pretends that she is the heroine. This 
is merely a concession to a conventional demand, 
and must not be taken seriously. The book would 
be no whit less interesting were the fair Mary left 
entirely out of its pages. The author can tell a capital 
story of naval adventure, but there is no sentiment 
in him, and he bungles the love-story sadly. 

A group of novels by Chicago writers calls for a 
few words of comment, perhaps the most noticeable 
thing about these books being the fact that no one 
of them is concerned with the city with which its 
author is identified. Mr. Opie Read takes us to 



Mississippi for a scene and Mr. Chatfield-Taylor to 
Washington, while Mr. Larned is satisfied with 
nothing less remote than the Pyrenees, and Mr. 
Horton bids his readers set sail for " the isles of 
Greece." Mr. Read's " Bolanyo " is the story of 
an actor, landed in a Mississippi town as the result 
of an explosion in a river steamer, cared for by the 
leading politician of those parts, persuaded to under- 
take the management of a local playhouse, and 
nearly lynched as the result of an unfortunate mis- 
understanding. The real interest of the book is 
supplied by neither the hero nor the story of his 
love for Senator Talcom's married daughter, but 
rather by the picturesque figure of the Senator him- 
self, who is a distinct type, delineated with consider- 
able skill. In spite of a certain stiffness of dialogue 
and a lack of the finer graces of literary art, the 
story is an entertaining one, and exhibits construc- 
tive talent in a marked degree. 

Pride, according to Pope and Mr. Chatfield-Tay- 
lor, is " The Vice of Fools " which pointed a moral 
for the former and provided the latter with a title. 
Mr. Chatfield-Taylor has been cultivating the epi- 
gram more assiduously than ever, and his novel 
fairly bristles with the shafts of wit and wisdom 
that go to make up the preternaturally clever con- 
versation of his characters. The thing is neatly 
done, but it does not seem altogether worth doing. 
Strip the book of these verbal trappings, and nothing 
worth considering remains. The author has here- 
tofore shown some ability to deal effectively with 
life, yet he now gives us nothing but the chatter of 
a few puppets, and would have it pass for a picture 
of Washington society. Even so impossible a volte- 
face as is executed by his General Lloyd in the 
closing chapters does not arouse a protest, for there 
is nothing real about the General anyway except 
his clothes and his manners or about any other 
figure in the book. And all the while the nerves 
are being rasped by an endless string of epigrams 
that make one long for relief in the form of some 
display of genuine human feeling. 

Mr. Larned, in his " Arnaud's Masterpiece," can 
hardly be credited with a hold upon life, any more 
than can the author of the book just before men- 
tioned, but he gives us at least tender sentiment and 
the vision of beauty in nature and in art. His 
charming tale is of the simplest in theme and dic- 
tion. It has caught something of the spirit of me- 
diaeval romance, and suggests to the reader, now 
the story of Aucassin and his love, now the wonder- 
imaginings of William Morris. While the author 
has not succeeded altogether in excluding modern 
modes of feeling from his work, he has nevertheless 
woven a web of delicate and graceful fancy about 
his painter-hero and the two maidens whose fates 
are entangled with his own. 

Mr. George Horton, although he has been serving 
his country in the Athenian consulate for several 
years past, may be reckoned a Chicagoan, and his 
" Constantino " given a place in this section of our 
review. The book gives us some interesting bits of

description, and a considerable quantity of quaint 
Greek ceremonial and folk-lore. Incidentally, it 
tells a moderately interesting story of the reign of 
King Otho, a story not very well constructed, but 
saved by its pretty style and somewhat novel ma- 
terial. The tragic outcome rather jars upon the 
reader in view of the cheerful tenor of what has 
gone before, although fair warning of what may be 
expected is provided in the opening chapter. 

The young writers of the hour who affect " style " 
and write story after story without having anything 
worth relating would probably dismiss with a very 
superior sort of sneer such a collection of tales as 
" Susan's Escort and Others," recently brought to- 
gether from various periodicals by Dr. Edward 
Everett Hale. But the larger-minded critics who, 
while appreciative of the virtue of literary form, 
think a story none the worse for displaying some 
inventive skill, or for reflecting a wholesome and 
genial personality, will not be disposed to scorn the 
entertainment offered by such a volume as this. 
There are nearly a score of pieces altogether, some 
based upon very slender conceits, others elaborating 
a more substantial idea, and all attractive in more 
ways than one. Their homeliness makes no demand 
upon high-wrought emotions, and their whimsicality 
keeps the reader alert for the fresh surprises that 
await him at every turn. We are frequently re- 
minded of the odd fancies of Mr. Stockton, but with 
the difference that the matter-of-fact manner is here 
not assumed as a literary device, but is rather the 
most natural form of the author's expression. 

Colonel Johnston's new volume, " Old Times in 
Middle Georgia," is a collection of a dozen or more 
tales and sketches of life in the State which he 
knows so well, and of the bygone period of which 
he retains so mellow yet vivid a memory. It is a 
phase of life which we should hardly know at all if 
it were not for this writer's happy and genial tran- 
scriptions from the book of his recollections. The 
stories are largely in dialect, but it is both accurate 
and inevitable, and our old quarrel with dialect 
writing does not extend to such a case as this. 
Colonel Johnston is facile princeps among the story- 
tellers who have kept alive in literature the memory 
of the old South ; his sketches have a tenderness of 
sentiment and a persuasive charm that bring his 
books close to our affections, for there somehow 
shines through them the light of a gracious and large- 
hearted personality, and reading them we learn to 
know the writer almost as well as we do the people 
who inhabit the old time world that he restores for us. 

The name of M. Jules Claretie is one that does 
not suggest the writer of fiction, yet the brilliant 
ritic and playwright has recently made two ventures 
in the field of romance, and both of them have found 
English translators. " The Crime of the Boulevard " 
might, indeed, have found a better one, for the 
version in which it is offered to the English-reading 
public is very slovenly, the work of a person who has 
neither accurate knowledge nor the least sense of 
style. The book is a detective novel of considerable 



ingenuity, although its denouement is made to result 
from an utterly impossible occurrence the retention 
of a photographic image upon the retina of a dead 
man's eye. The detective methods by which the 
murderer is tracked and trapped differ from those 
of Sherlock Holmes and Monsieur Lecocq in their 
reliance upon what we may call psychological indi- 
cations, the start of the guilty person at the artfully 
contrived speech, the unconscious admission made in 
the unguarded moment. The book has a vein of senti- 
ment which relieves the grewsomeness of its theme, 
and brings it into touch with ordinary human life. 
The sentimental element is even more marked in 
" Brichanteau, Actor," M. Claretie's other book, 
which has the good fortune to be translated into 
graceful and idiomatic English. We may hardly 
call it a novel, for it tells no connected narrative, 
but is rather an autobiographical series of episodes 
in the life of a professional comedian. If delinea- 
tion of character be the chief test of excellence in a 
work of fiction, this book must be given a high rank. 
The character of Brichanteau is thoroughly genuine, 
in its drawing so shaded as to bring out the most 
delicate nuance ; he compels both our admiration 
as an artistic creation and our affection as a fellow- 
creature. M. Sarcey, in a cordial introduction to 
the volume, describes its hero as " the actor en- 
amoured of his art, but who, for one reason or 
another, has not achieved success ... a failure 
without melancholy or envy, an optimist failure. 
. . . Brichanteau is charming because he is always 
treading the boards, because he believes in good 
faith that his life is a drama in which he plays the 
principal part." M. Claretie has described with 
delightful irony this ridiculous side of the character 
of his hero, " who wears in ordinary life the nod- 
ding plumes of the stage." We need say no more 
to show that Brichanteau is a charming companion, 
and that M. Claretie's book is a human document of 
the most genial and enjoyable kind.

In these two handy little volumes, which may be 
slipped within the pocket, he has given the results 
of three years' labor. The first volume contains 
over fifty geological and topographical maps a 
superb presentation of the physical characteristics 
of the land, based upon the researches of the Pales- 
tine Exploration Fund. These are accompanied by 
a descriptive text. The second volume contains 
some sixty general historical maps, and upwards of 
thirty plans of towns and environs. This volume

the earliest days to the close of the Crusades in the

thirteenth century. While the author in this sketch 
has assumed the integrity of the Biblical account as 
against the school of destructive criticism, he has 
availed himself of the whole literature of his sub- 
ject, from Ewald to Edersheim, Graetz to Hilprecht 
and Fetrie, and has made a most satisfactory sum- 
mary. The large collection of maps is an admir- 
able feature, in which every device of the engraver 
and the colorist has been employed to enable the 
student to realize the land of the Bible. A few 
points are open to criticism. It would have been 
better, in citing the authorities, to give volume and 
page. In two of the maps Nos. 59 and 94 
Alexandria and Persepolis are allowed to appear 
long before they were founded. In all other cases 
modern names and places are italicized, or else are 
distinguished by different coloring. The map of the 
beginning of the fifth century should divide Phoe- 
nicia into Maritima and Libanensis, as is done on 
the map following ; and Syria in both maps should 
be divided into Prima and Secunda. On the first 
of these maps Scythopolis (not Scythapolis) is placed 
too far from the Jordan. Schtirer is frequently 
spelled without the umlaut mark ; and we note in 
one case Lenormand for Lenormant. These are, 
however, but small flaws in a work so generally 
commendable. 

New guesses at Jt *** Goethe who said, All my 
the meaning of writings are fragments of a great 
Shakespeare, confession," and the critics, as a rule, 
have assumed the same thing of Shakespeare, espe- 
cially of his Sonnets. But so great has been the 
divergence of opinion with respect to the nature of 
this confession that the controversy gathering about 
them has become one of the most voluminous in 
all literature. The latest addition is by Mr. Edwin 
James Dunning in " The Genesis of Shakespeare's 
Art " (Lee & Shepard) ; and it must be granted 
that he has made a new furrow in this much- 
ploughed field. Mr. Dunning believes the Sonnets 
to be autobiographical, but in a less material sense 
than is commonly supposed. The supreme expres- 
sions of devoted love in the first series are not ad- 
dressed to William Herbert or any other, but refer 
symbolically to his own Muse or guiding genius ; his 
admonitions to the youth to marry express the poet's 
desire to spur his own fancy to invention. In the 
series expressing his jealousy of others, especially 
of some rival poet, he confesses his early dependence 
upon models, his imitation of the " fine filed phrase " 
of earlier poets. The " dark lady " is not Mary 
Fitton or any other person in the flesh, but under 
this figure Shakespeare records his own struggles 
between idealistic art, false in its very perfectness, 
toward a more realistic art, ugly of aspect but in- 
wardly alluring. Thus, in Mr. Dunning's opinion, 
the Sonnets as a whole are the outpouring of Shakes- 
peare's art-consciousness, and the record of his 
growth in finish, understanding and power as an 
artist. This is something quite new in the aesthetic 
interpretation of these poems, and makes of them a

Civil War. 



self-revealing sequence in a more exalted sense than 
any previous critic has suggested. It will not, of 
course, appeal with equal force to all readers ; many 
have already come to conclusions too fixed for change ; 
yet every new theory tends to increase the never- 
abated interest of three hundred years in these 
wonderful poems of " infinite variety," charm, and 
mystery. 

General Jacob D. Cox, once com- 
mander of the twenty-third army 
corps, has already given proof of his 
ability as a military historian in his two books for 
the " Campaigns of the Civil War " series, on " The 
Campaign of Atlanta" and " The March to the Sea," 
published some fifteen years ago. He has now taken 
up his pen again to give a more detailed account of 
a portion of the subject of his second work in a new 
book entitled " The Battle of Franklin " (Scribner). 
He says, in his justification, that " when a battle 
proves to be a turning-point in a decisive campaign, 
when it marks the beginning of the end in such 
a contest as our Civil War, when it justifies the 
strategy of such a leader as Sherman in his division 
of his forces in Georgia and making the March to 
the Sea, when in addition to this the combat may 
be fairly said to be a crucial experiment in the prob- 
lem of attack and defence of fieldworks in an open 
country, we can hardly place a limit to the desira- 
bility of detailed knowledge." The author has had 
the advantage of the completed publication of the 
"Official Records of the Union and Confederate 
Armies," and it is the completion of this great record 
which has induced General Cox to tell again the oft- 
told tale of the battle of Franklin. His work is a 
valuable contribution to our military history, and the 
narrative is told in a style that combines the knowl- 
edge of the warrior with the skill of the literary 
artist. The value of the book is enhanced by several 
maps from the official records. The work is thor- 
oughly well done, and will hardly require to be done 
again, despite the little controversy as to leadership 
between Generals Cox and Stanley, which is a side- 



issue. 



To see one's people yield before the 
invader; to see one's ancestral cus- 
toms supplanted by those of the hated 
conqueror ; to see one's religion replaced by a for- 
eign creed, these things are hard to bear. Yet 
these things have been borne all through our own 
land, through Mexico, and through Central America. 
The native populations have been reduced, their 
whole mode of life has been changed, their religions 
have been replaced. Few of the stories of these 
changes have been preserved ; all would be of thrill- 
ing, though sad, interest. Sometimes the Indian 
turned, in a vain effort to resist the new-comer. The 
story of one of these fruitless resistances is told in 
dramatic form, by Dr. D. G. Brinton, in the little 
book entitled " Maria Candelaria " (David McKay). 
The Tzentals lived in Chiapas, now the southern- 
most state of Mexico. In culture they were the

equals of almost any people in the Isthmian region. 
Reduced by the Spaniards in 1523 or 1524, they 
revolted in 1528, but were quickly resubjugated. 
They remained under Spanish control quietly until 
1712, when a stroke for freedom was made under 
the leadership of an Indian girl Maria Candelaria. 
An attempt was made to restore the old government, 
revive the ancient customs, and rethrone the ances- 
tral religion. For a time everything seemed to be 
in her favor ; but troubles arose, misunderstandings 
and treachery appeared, and the cause was lost. It 
is the closing scenes in this insurrection that Dr. 
Brinton dramatises. His book is at once interesting 
and a study, which reveals Indian thought and life 
with considerable probable accuracy. 






A pretty book which anticipates the 
^^Y *<on " that on Ely Ca- 
thedral," by the Dean of Ely (im- 
ported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons). One 
of the most beautiful of English minsters is here 
chronicled by one who is able to speak with author- 
ity, and full justice is done to the matchless octagon 
tower, and its noble artist Alan de Walsingham. 
Here are most interesting details as to the construc- 
tion of this famous octagon. Wonderful oak timber 
Old England produced in the fourteenth century ! 
The angle posts are each 53 feet long and 3 feet 4 
inches by 2 feet 8 inches in their other dimensions. 
Alan took much trouble to find trees sufficiently 
large and sound, " searching far and wide, and with 
the greatest difficulty finding them at last, paying a 
great price for them, and by land and sea trans- 
porting them to Ely." While the book is in sub- 
stance made up of two " Extension " lectures deliv- 
ered by the Dean, and is therefore popular in treat- 
ment, lovers of old Ely and its shrine will here find 
much to stir their recollection pleasantly, and the 
scholar may find in the appended notes valuable 
contributions on " Liber Elieusis " and the monas- 
tery rolls. _ 

Two charming volumes fresh from the 

Hamilton Gibson's < * TT T ^i 

farewell volumes. P ress of Messrs. Harper & Brothers 
bear the name of William Hamilton 
Gibson. They are a parting gift from a hand stilled 
in death ; and it is with a sense of personal bereave- 
ment one turns over their fascinating pages. Facing 
the title-page of " Eye Spy," a portrait of the author 
is presented in a characteristic attitude, gazing in- 
tently into the heart of a flower to read some ex- 
quisite mystery folded away from the view of the 
casual observer. In " My Studio Neighbors " he 
is seen again in the secluded spot where he painted 
his pictures and wrote his pen-sketches, or found 
inspiration for both in the myriad phases of ani- 
mate or inanimate nature surrounding him. It is, 
perhaps, our farewell interview with one who never 
failed to delight and instruct with his ingenious and 
picturesque portrayal of the wonders he discovered 
in the structure and behavior of bird and insect and 
their near allies in the floral world. Both volumes 



are made up of short papers, each an interesting 
and valuable story illustrated with drawings of deli- 
cate beauty. The instinct of the poet and the sin- 
cere feeling of the nature-student are apparent in 
every bit of work that bore the signature of this 
lamented author. 

The nature-lover'* "Nature's Diary " (Houghton), com- 
caiendar and piled by Mr. Francis H. Allen, will 
attract the eye by its tasteful exterior. 
It is done up in green, the cover and the smooth- 
cut edges of the leaves wearing the pleasing tints 
of earth's drapery in the summer season. The right- 
hand pages of the volume are left vacant for notes 
by the reader ; those on the left contain extracts 
arranged in the order of a calendar, one or two for 
each day in the year. All speak of some aspect of 
nature, chiefly of the landscape in the varying sea- 
sons. Nearly three hundred of the selections are 
from Thoreau ; the remainder are taken from a 
dozen well-known authors. A sameness results 
from this narrow range, which detracts from the 
interest of the compilation. Thoreau has written 
upon nature with fervor and beauty; but many 
others have equalled or surpassed him in imagery 
and diction, as, for example, Mrs. Celia Thaxter and 
Col. T. W. Higginson, both of whom the compiler 
has wholly left out of his account. 

Popular lecture* Mr - Bertram C. A. Windle's handy 
on English little book entitled " Life in Early 

archeology. Britain" (Putnam), covering in a 

popular way the whole field of English Archaeology, 
has grown out of a series of familiar lectures. The 
style is attractive throughout ; the material and its 
treatment are variable. Some chapters are capital, 
others are poor. The worst is that dealing with the 
Palaeolithic Period, in which the subject is poorly 
presented and the British material sadly neglected. 
The work deserves on the whole high praise. It 
will be a great help to the traveller. A brief out- 
line history of the succession of peoples on Britain's 
soil such as this is will render much that is seen 
in museums comprehensible and interesting. Not 
the least valuable part of the book is an appendix 
wherein is a list of places, geographically arranged, 
where British antiquities may be studied either in 
the field or in museums.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



Mr. John Morley's Rede lecture on " Machiavelli," 
published by the Macmillan Co. in a thin volume, revives 
the old regret that the author should have found so lit- 
tle time of recent years for literary production. Were 
it not for politics, we might have had a long series of 
just such essays as this graceful, ripe, scholarly pro- 
ductions and English literature would have been so 
much the richer. How happy was the writer's choice 
of a subject in the present instance is shown by the 
amount of discussion that has been provoked by the 
essay. Most of our modern statesmen have gone to 
Machiavelli's school, and some of them have bettered 
the instruction ; nothing could well be more timely, 
then, than an analysis of the Machiavellian theory of 
government, made by a man who has himself for many 
years been in the thick of modern political life. 

"The Yersin Phono-Rhythmic Method of French 
Pronunciation, Accent, and Diction " (Lippincott) is 
the work of two young women, Miles. M. and J. Yersin, 
who have had much practical experience as teachers of 
the French language, and who have now sought to im- 
part (as far as it is possible for the printed page to do 
so) the method by which they instruct their pupils in 
French phonetics. The work is eminently practical, 
and is provided with a very sensible introduction. Two 
other text-books in this language are the " first year " 
of Mr. C. F. Kroeh's " Three- Year Preparatory Course 
in French" (Macmillan), and Mr. Francis Tarver's 
" French Stumbling - Blocks and English Stepping- 
Stones " (Appleton), a helpful book for beginners. 

Recent texts for teachers of English include the fol- 
lowing : " Cymbeline," edited by Mr. A. J. Wyatt, 
and " The Tempest," edited by Mr. F. S. Boas, both 
published in " Heath's English Classics "; also, issued 
by the same publishers, " The Ancient Mariner," edited 
by Mr. A. J. George; "The Flight of a Tartar Tribe," 
edited by Mr. G. A.Wauchope; and" Enoch Arden" with 
the two " Locksley Hall " poems, edited by Mr. Calvin 
S. Brown. From Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. we have 
"The Revolt of the Tartars," edited by Mr. A. S. 
Twombly; and a thin volume of "Reading Courses in 
American Literature," by Mr. Fred L. Pattee. " The 
Expository Paragraph and Sentence " is an elementary 
manual of composition by Mr. Charles Sears Baldwin 
(Longmans). 

The inventor of " Love's Messages " (Crowell) has 
added a new terror to life. This publication takes the 
form of a cheque-book, and upon each leaf are printed 
a text and a stanza of pious verse. The purchaser of 
the booklet is supposed to detach the cheques and send 
them to his friends, recording upon the stubs the names 
of the victims of his impertinence. It would not be so 
bad if only the verses chosen had any poetical value, 
but with the exception of a (misquoted) stanza from 
Christine Rossetti and one or two other selections, they 
are of the most commonplace and uninspiring character. 



IiITERARY NOTES. 



The Whitaker & Ray Co. of San Francisco announce 
for early publication a one-volume edition of the com- 
plete poetical works of Mr. Joaquin Miller. 

The Macmillan Co. now publish in a single volume 
the two parts (which have hitherto appeared separately) 
of Mr. Ernest Arthur Gardner's " Handbook of Greek 
Sculpture." 

A fifth edition of Mr. Saintsbury's " Short History of 
French Literature," with the section on the nineteenth 
century practically rewritten, is about to issue from the 
Clarendon Press. 

The Rev. Henry Van Dyke's " Little Rivers " and 
" The Poetry of Tennyson " are two new volumes of the 
charming " Cameo Edition " of favorite books, published 
by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

Volume V. of Miss Wormeley's translation of Molie're, 
just published by Messrs. Roberts Brothers, includes 
three plays " L'Ecole des Femmes," " L'Ecole des. 
Maris," and " Monsieur de Pourceaugnac." 

" Rome," by Miss Mary Ford ; " France," by Miss 
Mary C. Rowsell; and "Old Tales from Greece," by 
Miss Alice Zimmern, are three history books for chil- 
dren just published by Mr. Thomas Whittaker. 

"Voices of Doubt and Trust" (Brentano's) is a com- 
pilation of selections (mostly good ones) in prose and 
verse from a wide range of modern writers who have 
touched upon the fundamental problem of religious 
belief. Mr. Volney Streamer is the editor, and his 
book is pleasant to handle and to read. 

Colonel F. R. Wiugate's translation of Slatin Pasha's 
" Fire and Sword in the Soudan " has just been reissued 
in a popular edition by Mr. Edward Arnold. The book 
has been shortened for the present purpose, and made 
more strictly personal than before, and the illustrations 
are retained. 

We have received from the Art Association of Port- 
land, Oregon, a neat " Catalogue of the Corbett Collec- 
tion of Casts from Greek and Roman Sculpture " 
owned by that institution. The book is a compilation 
from the similar catalogue of the Boston Museum, with 
some additional matter contributed by Mr. Richard 
Norton. 

Dr. Fridtjof Nansen is to be given a reception by the 
Twentieth Century Club on the afternoon of November 
17, and will deliver his first public lecture in Chicago on 
the evening of that day. The next reception of the club 
is set for December 6, upon which occasion Mr. Anthony 
Hope Hawkins will discourse on the subject of " Ro- 
mance." 

Bulwer-Lytton's "The Last Days of Pompeii" and 
Lever's " Charles O'Malley " have been issued in the 
" Illustrated English Library," of which Messrs. G. P. 
Putnam's Sons are the American importers. In regard 
to illustrations, mechanical make-up, and cheapness of 
price, this series compares favorably with any other line 
of reprints of standard fiction now on the market. 

Recently published text-books in science include the 
following works : " Practical Electrics " (Spon and 
Chamberlain), " a universal handy-book of everyday

The Alumni Association of Franklin and Marshall 
College have begun the publication of an " Obituary 
Record " for that century-old institution. The first 
number, a volume of nearly two hundred and fifty 
pages, brings the record up to the present year, and 
hereafter annual supplements are promised. One may 
become a life subscriber to this publication for the sum 
of two dollars. 

" The Students' American History," by Mr. D. H. 
Montgomery (Ginn), is a more extensive work than 
the author's " Leading Facts of American History," 
and designed for students of somewhat maturer growth. 
It is an admirable text-book, the product of wide ex- 
perience in both teaching and writing, amply illustrated 
with the right sort of material, supplied with helps for 
further study, and altogether deserving of the highest 
commendation. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the publishers of the following

Brunnanburh," edited by Dr. Charles Langley Crow; 
and " The Science of Discourse," a rhetoric for high 
schools and colleges, by Mr. Arnold Tompkins. The 
latter is a new edition of a work first published eight 
years ago.

Mr. John Osborne Austin, of Providence, has com- 
piled a " Roger Williams Calendar," in the form of a

has a pithy extract from the great apostle of liberty of

dropped into poetry, and the following is one of several 
curious examples: 

" If nature's sons, both wild and tame, 

Humane and courteous be,

To want humanity." 

Precisely what the Stanhope Essay is, or how it

in a duodecimo of seventy-eight pages. It is not a bio- 
graphy, but, as its name implies, an essay ; and it seeks 
to sketch Sir Walter's character " roughly and crudely ; 
to trace the war of motives which at all times beset 
him ; to find, in short, in his temper and talents some 
explanation of the cruel circumstances of his fate." 
And it does all this in a manner with which the reader 
can find no fault.

Mrs. Latimer has achieved a signal success in this 
the latest (and probably the last) of her very popular 
XIX. Century Histories. The book gives information

in any other one volume now accessible. The history 
is brought down to the present day, and a chapter is 
devoted to the Spanish colonies in South America and 
a chapter to Cuba.

trated and otherwise uniform with "Spain," previously 
published are :

without thoughts of criticism." The Bookman.

HARPER'S MAGAZINE 

- : For 1898 r3SrtS$j 

A NEW NOVEL BY HENRY SETON MERRIMAN 

Author of " THE SOWERS," will begin in the January number. It will be entitled 



RODEN'S CORNER 



And is located for the most part in The Hague, but has also picturesque and noteworthy glimpses of London society. It 
is itself, in its primary motive, a keen satire upon the pharisaic aspects of modern altruism. The theme is developed with 
wonderful dramatic power ; the local color and the characterization are vivid ; and the thoughtful critic will he as much 
impressed by the writer's subtle reflections as by his fine artistic temper, which is shown especially in the reserve which 
veils the passionate movement of the story. The novel will be illustrated by T. DE THULSTRUP from actual studies of the 
life presented by the author in England and Holland.

"In a country unsurpassed for magazines, 'The Century' stands unsurpassed." Chicago Tribune. 

THE CENTURY 

For the Coming Year. 

""THE Boston Herald recently said, " So adequate a combination of ability and of interest, of timeliness and of 
* permanency, of criticism and description, of fiction and of history, and, finally, of literature and of art, is 
not attained by any other magazine." In the pages of THE CENTURY appear the articles that people talk most 
about, those which attract the most attention in the world of letters. Its editorials make for good citizen- 
ship; as has been aptly said, "THE CENTURY stands for something." 

The plans for the coming year justify the publishers in the belief that not only will all of the cherished 
traditions of the past be preserved, but that the magazine will make a distinct advance, winning new friends 
and adding many new subscribers. The great success of Dr. Weir Mitchell's novel of the American Revolu- 
tion, " Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker," will make of special interest the announcement of 

A New Novel by Dr. Mitchell,

Revolutionary, and modern miniature painters. Ornamental buckram, gilt top, deckel edges, $3.00; three- 
quarters levant, $6.00. 

Anne Hollingsworth Wharton has produced a volume on Miniatures, their painters, and the distinguished old families 
who possessed them, -which will fascinate readers who have hitherto dealt only with the more homely side of the Colonial and 
Revolutionary eras. The volume is full of effective reproductions of miniature likenesses of the past generations, and it is 
rendered of present value to the many now engaged in this exquisite art by a chapter on the technique of miniature painting 
by Emily D. Taylor, whose lovely work has recently been crowned by appearance in the Paris Salon.

By SYDNEY GEORGE FISHER. Illustrated with four photogravures and numerous head and tail sketches in each 
volume. Two volumes. Satine, in a box, $3.00; half calf or half morocco, $6.00. 
How many of us realize what the life of our forefathers was really like ? How many know of the sharp contrasts between 

the various colonies ? How much of our character was given us by our ancestors ? What do we know of them their hopes, 

their fears, their lives, their deaths ? The fullest study and the most entertaining volumes on the subject are these by Mr. 

Fisher. He has delved into original sources of information, and has given it to us in a style of vivid interest.

box. Buckram, extra, $3.00; half calf or half morocco, $6.00. Sold separately or in sets. 
"Mr. Abbott is a kindred spirit with Burroughs and Maurice Thompson and, we might add, Thoreau in his love for wild 

nature, and with Olive Thorne Miller in his love for the birds. He writes without a trace of affectation, and his simple, 

compact, yet polished style breathes of out-of-doors in every line." N. Y. Churchman. 

WITH FEET TO THE EARTH. 

By CHARLES M. SKINNER, author of "Myths and Legends of Our Own Land," etc. Buckram, ornamental, gilt 

top, deckel edges, $1.25. 

Nature books there are galore, but Mr. Skinner has opened a new field. Never has so much human interest and amuse- 
ment been packed between the covers of the book of the rambler as here. As Mr. Skinner, with feet to the earth, has 
wandered over its surface, his keen observation, genial humor, and thoughtful mind have been quite as much awake to what 
is entertaining in its human inhabitants as in nature itself.

etc. Royal octavo. Handsomely bound, $7.50. Published in connection with Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.,

"Mr. Chamberlain's book is written with a pen burning with enthusiastic adoration of Wagner's genius. He gives us a 

vivid picture of the master's life, his aims, his worldly failures and spiritual achievements. Existing biographies, records, and 

letters have been carefully and intelligently read and sifted, and a certain simplicity of style will make the book popular in 

the best sense of the word." WALTER DAMROSCH.

PRINCIPLES OF VOCAL EXPRESSION 
AND MENTAL TECHNIQUE AND LITERARY INTERPRETATION. 

By W. B. CHAMBERLAIN, A.M., of the Chicago Theological Seminary; and 
S. H. CLARK, Ph.B., of the University of Chicago. 

The principles of vocal expression lie not in any mechanical rules, but in the last analysis in the thoughts and feelings 
of the speaker. Whoever would understand the philosophy of expression and the rules which govern it, must, therefore, 
first learn how to think and feel with the author whom he would interpret. The speaker must KNOW the mind and heart 
of the writer in order to give vocal expression to his literary creations ; and must be so far master of the art of expression as 
to make his own thoughts and feelings most forceful to another. This theory has produced the new book on the methods or 
principles of expression by Professors Chamberlain and Clark. The authors do not claim that they are in everything original, 
but they believe that they have suggested certain principles of study and certain methods of practice for public speakers and 
readers, which have not heretofore been stated in the form here given them.

a unique experiment in fiction the volume 
containing the man's side of a story, the wom- 
an's side of which has been already told.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE 
: FOR 1898 :'""''"' 

This is a Partial* Announcement for Next Year: 



" Tbe Story of the Revolution," 

By SENATOR HENRY CABOT LODGE, will run 
throughout 1898 as one of the leading features. 
The author of " The Life of Washington " under- 
took this large work with two ideas in view : (1) 
To present the fight for American independence 
not as a dry history but a vivid picture of vital 
struggle reproducing the atmosphere and feeling 
of the time. (2) To make clear the historical 
significance and proportion of the events described. 
(For the first time all the modern art forces and 
resources will be brought to bear upon the Revo- 
lution. Howard Pyle and a corps of artists began 
work upon it last summer.) 

CAPTAIN A. T. MAHAN'S 

" Tbe American &[avy in the 
Revolution" 

Will be a group of articles written to complement 
'The Story of the Revolution." They will deal 
largely with the romantic side of our sea-fighting. 
(They will be illustrated by Carlton T. Chapman, 
Harry Fenn, and some of the same artists that 
are at work on " The Revolution.") 

ROBERT GRANT'S 

" Search- Light Letters" 

Are his replies to various letters that were brought 
in to him in consequence of his " Reflections of a 
Married Man " and " The Opinions of a Philoso- 
pher." They are written with his characteristic 
humor combined with uncommon sense. 

"Life at Girls' Colleges" 

Like the articles on " Undergraduate Life at Har- 
vard, Princeton, and Yale," will tell of the manners, 
customs, and life of various American college girls. 
(Richly illustrated.) 



THOMAS NELSON PAGE'S FIRST LONG 
NOVEL, 

"Red Rock A Chronicle of 
Reconstruction" 

Will be Scribner's leading fiction serial during '98. 
Mr. Page has hitherto written of the Old South or 
the New South ; he now writes, with all the rich- 
ness of color that has gained him so much affec- 
tion, the novel of the era when the Old South 
was lost forever and the New South had not yet 
found itself. Mr. Page has devoted four years to 
the story, and he considers it his best work. (It 
will be illustrated by B. West Clinedinst). 

" The Workers." 

WALTER A. WYCKOFF, the college graduate who 
became a day-laborer in order to learn the truth 
about the working classes, will continue the story 
of his two years' experiment. In '98 he will tell 
about his experience with laborers and anarchists 
in Chicago and the problems of organized labor. 
(Fully illustrated by W. R. Leigh.) 

Senator Hoar's Political Reminiscences. 

SENATOR HOAR is a shrewd observer and a witty 
writer, and he has been in public life for forty-five 
years. 

"Bits of Europe in America." 

The three most typical European settlements in 
this country have been studied by three women 
writers, Octave Thanet, Cornelia Atwood Pratt, 
and Elia W. Peattie. (Fully illustrated.) 

Short Fiction. 

RUDYARD KIPLING, GEORGE W. CABLE, KENNETH 
GRAHAME, and others, are under engagement to 
contribute short stories during 1898. 



* The full prospectus in tmall book form, printed in colors, with illustrations (cover and decorations by Maxfield Parrish), 
will be sent upon application.

A PHILISTINE WATCHWORD. 

Readers of " The International Journal of 
Ethics " must have rubbed their eyes when they 
received the last number of that earnest and 
valuable review, and found its first score of 
pages devoted to the great achievement of Dr. 
Nansen in Arctic exploration. What has such 
a matter to do with ethics ? they may well have 
asked, and why should our attention be diverted 
to the deeds of this hardy Norseman when all 
our intellectual energies are needed for the 
examination of such engaging subjects as " the 
relation of pessimism to ultimate philosophy," 
and " our social and ethical solidarity," and 
" the history and spirit of Chinese ethics," to 
instance a few of the themes discussed within 
the same covers. The fact that Mr. Leslie 
Stephen was responsible for this diversion gave 
promise, indeed, of a high degree of intellectual 
entertainment ; but one had to get well along 
into the essay before discovering what Dr. 
Nansen was really doing in this galley. The 
name of the writer was, of course, sufficient to 
warrant the conclusion that the choice of sub- 
ject would prove to be justified, even for the 
purposes of a " journal of ethics "; and the 
event showed that some of the deepest matters 
underlying the general problem of conduct 
might be involved in the story of the explorer 
and the stanch ship that drifted with the

northern ice-cap across the circumpolar seas. 

There is, to put it bluntly, no ethical prob- 
lem of greater importance than that which 
emerges from the consideration of just such 
activities as were so magnificently displayed 
by the expedition of Dr. Nansen. It is the 
fundamental problem of utilitarianism, and the 
most searching analysis is needed before we 
can hope to straighten it out. Into all discus- 
sions of this problem the philistine shibboleth 
of the "practical" forces its way, and puts such 
questions as these : " Is it not wrong to admire 
men whose fine qualities run more or less to 
waste ; or, if that cannot be said, that might 
have been applied to some purpose of more 
importance to the welfare of mankind? To 
admire simplicity, daring, vigor, and good com- 
radeship, is of course right ; but ought we not, 
it may be asked, to regret all the more their 
devotion of these virtues to inadequate ends?" 

Mr. Stephen finds no difficulty in answer- 
ing these questions to the confutation of their 
philistine proponent. " You admit," he says 
to the short-sighted utilitarian who can see 
nothing beyond the immediate consequences of 
a given display of effort, " you admit in some 
sense that the main end of conduct should be 
to promote the greatest happiness of the great- 
est number ; and yet the precepts which you 
deduce from your principles seem to imply a 
colorless monotony and a life uncheered by any 
pursuits enjoyable in themselves." Grouping 
the work of Arctic expeditions with other sci- 
entific work, and with art and literature, as con- 
stituting all together a sort of "play," he says: 
" The justification for play, if we may call that 
play which involves most strenuous labor, must 
take a different ground. One ground is that 
the energy which has had no directly utilitarian 
aim has been of most essential service to man- 
kind ; that, if the world has improved even in 
the sense of being able to support a larger popu- 
lation in moderate comfort, the improvement 
has been owing not simply nor perhaps chiefly 
to those who have consciously labored to redress 
grievances and remove causes of misery, but to 
men who have pursued intellectual aims, scien- 
tific or artistic, for the pure love of art or 
science." And he concludes by saying that 
" the true doctrine seems to be that it is an 
imperative duty for a man to devote his intel- 
lect to those purposes, whatever they may be, 
to which it is most fitted." 

The spokesmen of the " practical " have 
done so much in all ages, and are still doing 
so much, to chill enthusiasms and to narrow 



the scope of life, that we make no apology for 
recurring to this well-worn theme, and pointing 
out once more the essential misconception of 
those well-intentioned but purblind persons. 
" Why was this waste of the ointment made?" 
is a question that we hear repeated, in vari- 
ous disguises, every day of our lives. Now 
there are two satisfactory answers to the ques- 
tion in all of its forms : one of them faces the 
utilitarian critic upon his own plane and leaves 
him no ground upon which to stand, while the 
other makes the radical demand that he broaden 
his conception of utility and rearrange his no- 
tions of conduct in accordance with a far finer 
envisagement of the purpose of human life. 

The first answer is the one more commonly 
made. Mr. Stephen, for example, makes it in 
these words : " Knowledge can scarcely be ad- 
vanced in any direction without throwing light 
upon knowledge in general ; and the devotion 
of some men of great powers to minute and 
apparently remote interests is really to be ad- 
mired because it constantly leads to unforeseen 
and important results." The history of science 
is so filled with illustrations of this truth that 
we hardly know where to begin in making a 
selection. Take almost any of the achieve- 
ments of applied science and trace the under- 
lying ideas back to their genesis in the brain 
of some devoted investigator, or, reversing the 
process, take from the annals of the history of 
science any idea that has proved fertile and 
show what extremely practical results have 
grown out of it, and, in whichever way we 
construct the genealogy of our chosen idea, we 
shall be filled with wonder at its consequences, 
and made to realize that such consequences 
must, in the very nature of things, be largely 
or wholly unforeseen when the idea first springs 
to birth. How useless, to all seeming, were 
the early studies of micro-organisms, and 
yet these studies laid the foundation for the 
vast benefactions of Pasteur and made a reality 
of the long-cherished dream of a rational theory 
of disease. Or how could Oersted, or the most 
keen-sighted of his contemporaries, have fore- 
seen that his discovery of the deflection of the 
magnetic needle by the galvanic current was 
to make possible all the countless applications 
of electricity to our modern life ? In view of 
such facts as these, how childish it is to ask of 
every new contribution to knowledge that it at 
once justify its existence by doing something 
for man's material comfort, and how benighted 
must be his mental condition who scorns every 
new scientific truth that may not at once be put 



1897.]

to some practical use. And, to return to the 
immediate theme of this discourse, the man 
stands intellectually self-condemned who is rash 
enough to assert that the deep-sea soundings or 
the magnetic and meteorological observations 
made by the Nansen expedition may not in the 
future prove to have furnished a necessary link 
in the chain of reasoning whereby some vast 
new gift shall be bestowed by science upon 
human life. 

Strong as appears, however, the argument 
above outlined, and amply sufficient as it is to 
answer the cui bono ? of the philistine critic, 
we are not content to rest upon it the case for 
science. For there always underlies the dis- 
cussion of this subject a source of misunder- 
standing that is rarely probed. The respective 
champions of science and of utilitarianism may 
be using the same words, but they are not speak- 
ing the same language. In employing the terms 
which they bandy about so freely such terms, 
for example, as use," " benefit," and practical 
value" they are nearly always playing at 
<3ross-purposes, and the one seldom understands 
what the other really means. Why is one 
thing more practical than another ? The only 
possible answer is that it contributes more 
directly to the satisfaction of some desire. But 
how great is the arrogance of those who single 
out certain desires of a sort relating almost 
wholly to matters of material comfort, and 
assume that those desires alone are worthy of 
being gratified at the cost of any effort. Is a 
desire to be scorned because it does not happen 
to be entertained by the majority of unthinking 
people, and is the quality of a desire to count 
for nothing in this calculus of ethical values ? 
And if we take quality into the reckoning, does 
not the advancement of knowledge minister to 
the best of all desires ? The search after truth 
is an end in itself, and nothing can be more 
practical, in any sense of the term worth con- 
sidering, than the prosecution of that high 
quest. To think God's thoughts seemed to 
Kepler a worthy employment for his best in- 
tellectual energies, and 

" To follow knowledge like a sinking star 
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought," 

seemed to the master-singer of our own age the 
noblest of all aims. It is by just the extent to 
which man is capable of entertaining such ideal 
ambitions that he is lifted above the beast of 
the fields, and the humanity is in pitiable case 
that can scorn any sincere effort to strengthen 
the foundations of the temple of human knowl- 
edge or bear its dome still further skyward. 



THE ANXALS OF A FAMOUS PUBLISHING 
HOUSE.* 

Mrs. Oliphant's delightful book, The An- 
nals of a Publishing House " (a posthumous 
book, alas), embodies a favorite scheme of the 
late John Blackwood, a son of the founder of 
the famous Edinburgh house, so long and hon- 
orably known to the world of letters. It had 
been the intention of Mr. Blackwood, as we 
learn in his nephew's prefatory note, to utilize 
the firm's copious records in the preparation of 
a work that should serve as a memorial of his 
father and brothers, and as a history of the 
firm and the magazine that William Blackwood 
founded, and which should at the same time 
furnish some account of the brilliant band of 
writers whom the energy, discrimination, and 
very genuine love of letters of the first Black- 
wood, as we may venture to style him, rallied 
to his support. John Blackwood died without 
setting his scheme on foot. But his idea bore 
fruit in a subsequent proposal to Mrs. Oli- 
phant to carry out his project and to become 
the historian of the firm in whose service she 
was an honored veteran. Mrs. Oliphant ac- 
cepted the trust with the ready zeal of a loyal 
retainer, but with the pathetic prescience that 
the projected work was destined to mark the 
termination of her long and strenuous literary 
career. This prevision, as we know, proved 
true, and in a sense even overtrue, two volumes 
of the intended three being all that this gifted 
and amiable writer lived to complete. It is 
grateful to add that these valedictory volumes 
betray no symptom of flagging powers or cool- 
ing sympathies, no abatement of that even and 
ample flow of thought characteristic of the 
writer. All in all, we have had no more de- 
lightful book from Mrs. Oliphant than this, 
her last. It was clearly, with her, something 
of a labor of love to render justice to the ster- 
ling character of the founder of the house with 
which her own relations had been so cordial, 
and she found a congenial theme in the humors 
of the somewhat Shandean circle of writers 
who aided the rise, spread the fame, and too 
often sorely taxed the purse and patience, of 
kind and sensible William Blackwood. To the 
racy story of his dealings with those dashing 
condottieri of the pen, Lockhart, Wilson, Hogg,

[Dec. 1, 



Maginn, Gait, and so on, her opening volume 
is largely devoted. 

In beginning her history of the house of 
Blackwood, Mrs. Oliphant spares the grateful 
reader the usual Scotch " ell of genealogy." For 
us, William Blackwood is large enough to stand 
as first of his line and father of his own for- 
tunes, though doubtless with him, as with 
most Scotchmen, research would disclose an 
" ancestor " or so, were it only some sixpenny 
laird of a kailyard or notable Highland cattle- 
thief. It was in 1804 that this first Blackwood, 
after a fourteen years' novitiate at Edinburgh, 
Glasgow, and London, returned finally to Edin- 
burgh and " set up for himself " as bookseller 
and possible publisher on the South Bridge. 
The business throve apace. In 1811 was 
formed the important connection with John 
Murray of London, who threw over the Ballan- 
tynes on their failure to offer him a share in 
the publication of " The Lady of the Lake." 
Mr. Blackwood's first notably successful publi- 
cation was Dr. McCrie's " Life of John Knox." 
In 1816 he secured, through Ballantyne and 
jointly with Murray, Scott's "Tales of My 
Landlord." The squabble (if we may call it 
so) which marked this transaction, and which 
perhaps led up eventually to Scott's ill-starred 
return to Constable, has been variously stated. 
Mrs. Oliphant tries to show that Murray, more 
than Blackwood, was at fault; but it is pretty 
plain that the latter, too, " put his foot in it." 
It seems that after long negotiations with the 
agent of the still unknown author of "Waver- 
ley," the first instalment of the " Tales " was 
submitted to the publishers. Murray showed 
the manuscript to Gifford, who sagely suggested 
some " improvements " which were approved by 
Mr. Blackwood, who in his turn forwarded the 
suggestions and strictures through Ballantyne 
to the author. Scott, stung at the presumption 
of the trio of wiseacres, flamed into wrath, and 
wrote to Ballautyne in the vein of one of his 
own moss-troopers: 

"Dear James: I have received Blackwood's impu- 
dent letter. G d his soul! Tell him and his 
coadjutor that I belong to the Black Hussars of Litera- 
ture, who neither give nor receive criticism. I '11 be 
cursed but this is the most impudent proposal that ever 
was made." 

Plausible James, more suo, sent a sugared ver- 
sion of this robust missive to Blackwood; but 
the offense was given, as the sequel seems to 
show; and it only remained for the chagrined 
men of business to settle the balance of account- 
ability between them. Probably they joined 
forces in rating the sagacious Gifford. 



At this period, Edinburgh was at the zenith 
of its fame as a mart and centre of letters. The 
blaze of more than one great reputation gilded 
the haze of "auld Reekie" with sunrise splen- 
dors ; and the conditions in the publishing world 
were such as to greatly invite and stimulate lit- 
erary activity. The marvellous success of the 
books of Scott and Byron disclosed a new El- 
dorado; and the dazzled publisher, south as 
well as north of Tweed, was delightfully pre- 
disposed to see in each strange young gentle- 
man who came to him with a manuscript in his 
pocket a possible rival of those popular bards. 
Speculation was rife ; and a strange spirit of 
equity, even liberality, warmed the hearts and 
loosened the purse-strings of the Bacons and 
Bungays of the trade. Authorship, even of the 
Grub Street sort, suddenly lifted its head, and 
claimed kindred with the liberal professions. 
The days when Otways and Chattertons starved 
in garrets, and scholarly Boyces were reduced 
in winter to composing in bed, with the pen 
hand thrust through a slit in the blankets, were 
gone indeed. Manuscripts from obscure sources 
were usually acknowledged courteously, and even 
deferentially ; and when rejected, it was in terms 
that carried balm to the soul of the sender. 
Beautiful day, when the haughtiest publisher 
recognized between himself and the humblest 
brother of the craft by which he too lived, the 
bond of a common humanity! As for the 
prices paid, they were sometimes simply fabu- 
lous. Lord Cockburn says of Constable " the 
crafty" Constable: 

" Abandoning the old timid and grudging system, he 
stood out as the general patron and payer of all promis- 
ing publications, and confounded not only his rivals in 
trade but his very authors by his unheard of pieces. 
Ten, even twenty guineas a sheet for a review, 2000 
or 3000 for a single poem, and 1000 for two philo- 
sophical dissertations, drew authors out of their dens, 
and made Edinburgh a literary market famous with 
strangers, and the pride of its own citizens." 

The fate of this open-handed publisher the 
world knows ; but such was not always the re- 
ward of the more prodigal members of the 
trade. Some of them (we rejoice to know) 
perversely grew rich, in spite of Adam Smith 
and the penny-wisdom of their faint-hearted 
competitors. Murray too, for instance, was a 
publisher in the grand style, as the following 
letter shows: 

" Lord Byron is a curious man. He gave me, as I 
told you, the copyright of his two new poems, to be 
printed only in his works. I was so delighted with it 
that even as I read it I sent him a draught for 1000 
guineas. . . . But he returned the draught, saying it 
was very liberal much more than they were worth ; 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



327 



that I was perfectly welcome to both poems to print in 
his (collected) works without cost or expectation, but 
that he did not think them equal to what they ought to 
be. I went yesterday, and he was rallying me upon my 
folly in offering so much, that he dared to say I thought 
now I had a most lucky escape. To prove how much 
I think so, my lord,' said I, do me the favor to accept 
this pocket-book ' in which I had brought with me my 
draught changed into two bank-notes of 1000 and 
50; but he would not take it." 

Could anything be finer or more magnanimous 
than that? The publisher's almost pathetic 
anxiety to part with his money ; the author's 
firm, though playful, refusal to take it; the 
resolution of each not to be outdone by the 
other in indifference to pelf ; the fine Castilian 
flavor of the whole transaction. Shade of Ja- 
cob Tonson ! Nor was William Blackwood a 
whit behind his regal London correspondent as 
a patron of letters. His reply, in 1817, to an 
unknown writer who had timidly sent him a 
specimen, is a magnificent thing. Let the 
reader note that in it Mr. Blackwood lauds to 
the skies a production which he clearly in- 
tended to buy actually puffs it in advance, to 
his own manifest loss and diminution of profit. 
Could there possibly be a more undiplomatic, 
a more hopelessly unbusinesslike, letter than 
this? 

"Mr. Blackwood now returns to the author the en- 
closed manuscript, which he has perused oftener than 
once with the highest delight. He feels not a little 
proud that such a writer should express a wish to re- 
ceive any suggestion from him. The whole construction 
and execution of the work appear to him so admirable 
that it would almost be presumption in anyone to offer 
corrections to such a writer. . . . Mr. B. will not allow 
himself to think for one moment that there can be any 
uncertainty as to the work being completed. Not to 
mention his own deep disappointment, Mr. B. would 
almost consider it a crime if a work possessing so much 
interest and instruction were not given to the world." 

The unknown writer proved to be Miss Susan 
Ferrier, and the book under discussion her suc- 
cessful novel, " Marriage," issued by Black- 
wood in 1818. 

It need not be inferred, however, that so 
shrewd a judge of what he dealt in as was 
William Blackwood could not say " no " to the 
literary aspirant whose wares were not to his 
taste. He does not seem to have troubled 
himself to say even that much to poor Bran- 
well Bronte, whose frantic appeals to his judg- 
ment, and even his mercy, would be ridiculous 
enough were they not so grimly pathetic. Per- 
haps he thought the petitioner crazy. In one 
letter the poor fellow ("who aspired to admis- 
sion to the staff of " Maga ") declares that 
the idea of writing for any other periodical is 
" horribly repulsive " to him. He goes on to 



say to a publisher who, it seems, had never 
even replied to his effusions: 

"My resolution is to devote my ability to you; and 
for God's sake, till you see whether or not I can serve 
you, do not coldly refuse my aid. All, sir, that I de- 
sire of you is : that in answer to this letter you would 
request a specimen or specimens of my writing, and I even 
wish that you would name the subject on which you would 
wish me to write. ... I know that I am not one 
of the wretched writers of the day. . . . Now, 
sir, do not act like a commonplace person, but like a 
man willing to examine for himself. Do not turn from 
the native truth of my letters, but prove me; and if I 
do not stand the proof I will not further press myself 
on you. If I do stand it why you have lost an 
able writer in James Hogg, and God grant you may get 
PATRICK BRANWELL BRONTE." 



one 111 



That this appeal also elicited no reply appears 
from the fact that there is a letter dated four 
months later, endorsed, in very large printed 
characters, '* SIR, READ NOW AT LAST." It en- 
closed a poem (entitled "Misery, Scene 1st"!) 
and ends with : 

" I send it because it is soon read and comes from 
the heart. If it goes to yours, print it, and write to 
me on the subject of contribution. Then I will send 
prose. But if what I now send is worthless, what I 
have said has only been conceit and folly. Yet CON- 
DEMN NOT UNHEARD." 

The last letter quoted from this writer begs 
for an interview, and hints temptingly at some- 
thing (in the prose way) in the writer's pos- 
session, " the design of which, whatever might 
be its execution, would be superior to that of 
any series of articles which has yet appeared 
in ' Blackwood's Magazine.' ' " Now, sir," 
concludes this unhappy foil of his brilliant 
sisters, " is the trouble of writing a single line 
to outweigh the certainty of doing good to a 
fellow-creature and the possibility of doing 
good to yourself? Is it pride which actuates 
you or custom or prejudice ? Be a Man, 
sir! " etc., etc. Poor Bran well ! no leaf of the 
Bronte laurels grew for him. 

The crowning achievement of William Black- 
wood's earlier career was, of course, the starting 
of " Blackwood's Magazine." Of this event, 
as of the corps of clever scribblers (we had al- 
most said scamps) who rallied to " Maga" and 
gleefully proceeded to run amuck at all Edin- 
burgh and half London, Mrs. Oliphant gives a 
lively account. The initial " Blackwood " scored 
a tremendous success. Why ? Chiefly, so far as 
we can perceive, by reason of its scurrillity. 
We rejoice to think that a publisher who 
should father such a thing nowadays would be 
a lost man. We would no more tolerate him 
than we would tolerate Theodore Hook that 
precious " wit " who used to pour melted butter

into people's coat-pockets, and distribute medi- 
cated sweets at evening parties. But tastes 
and standards were otherwise in Mr. Black- 
wood's days ; and " Auld Reekie " rose to the 
new magazine with joyful plaudits. Mingled 
ominously, however, with the roar of Homeric 
laughter came a deepening wail of angry dis- 
content from the victims. Those who were 
hardest hit or thinnest skinned talked of the 
law ; and presently writs and threats of writs 
fell in at the Princes Street office like leaves 
in Vallombrosa. Wilson and Lockhart fled to 
the lakes ; and the owner of " Ebony " stayed 
to brave the storm. The most generally offend- 
ing (though not the most offensive) paper in 
the magazine was of course the " Chaldee 
Manuscript." Everybody has heard of this 
jeu d* esprit ; few of our own day have read it. 
Those who do read it will marvel at the tempest 
it raised in the Edinburgh teapot. Compared 
with the airy raillery of a moquer of genius 
like Heine, it seems a rather Boeotian perform- 
ance a piece of literary horse- play that old 
Burton might have relished as he relished the 
banter of the Oxford bargees. Briefly de- 
scribed, it was a local satire, bristling with 
thinly-veiled personalities, some of them merely 
playful, others malicious enough, and couched 
in Biblical language. Mrs. Oliphant furnishes 
some specimens of it (presumably favorable 
ones), one of which, an elegant " drive " at Sir 
John G. Dalyell, we subjoin : 

" Now the other beast [Sir John] was a beast that he 
[Constable] loved not : a beast of burden which he had 
in his courts to hew wood and to draw water and to do 
all manner of unclean things. His face was like unto 
the face of an ape, and he chattered continually, and 
his nether parts were uncomely. Nevertheless his thighs 
were hairy, and the hair was as the shining of a satin 
raiment, and he skipped with the branch of a tree in his 
hand, and he chewed a snail between his teeth. ... If 
thou lookest upon him and observest his ways, behold 
he was born of his mother before the months were ful- 
filled, and the substance of a living thing is not in him, 
and his horns are like the potsherd which is broken 
against any tree." 

But we must now take leave of Mrs. Oli- 
phant's sprightly book one of the best, we 
repeat, that she has given us. The second vol- 
ume deals largely with celebrities of a some- 
what later date than that of those we have men- 
tioned, and whets the appetite for a third and 
final volume, from another hand, which Mr. 
William Blackwood in his prefatory note en- 
courages us to look for. The work is hand- 
somely printed by Messrs. William Blackwood 
& Sons, and contains portraits of the successive 
chiefs of that sterling house. E. G. J. 



A GLIMPSE OF PURITAN NEW ENGLAND.* 

If one should open at random the diary of 
Samuel Sewall, recently published in three large 
volumes by the Massachusetts Historical Society, 
his eye would be very likely to fall on some 
such passage as the following, under date of 
Nov. 6, 1692 : 

" Joseph threw a knob of brass and hit his little sister 
Betty on the forehead so as to make it bleed and swell; 
upon which and for playing at prayer-time and eating 
when return thanks I whipped him pretty smartly. 
When I first went in (called by his grandmother) he 
sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind the 
head of the cradle; which gave me the sorrowful re- 
membrance of Adam's carriage." 

Inferior in literary merit to Evelyn and 
Pepys, Sewall may yet be classed with his two 
contemporary diarists ; resembling the former 
in the piety which tinges his journal, and the 
latter in the variety of his scope and the per- 
sonal, even trivial, nature of much that he 
records. The author of " Samuel Sewall and 
the World He Lived In," with an enthusiasm 
for his theme without which, indeed, his book 
would not be the very readable book it is, claims 
that " with these two Englishmen, in due time, 
by a well-weighed and just verdict, Samuel 
Sewall will be associated in the same lasting 
fame." 

Sewall's life, mostly spent in or near Boston, 
and chiefly in the public capacities of judge and 
of chief justice of the supreme court of Massa- 
chusetts, cannot fail, when carefully recorded, 
to be of interest ; and when the record is based 
largely on his voluminous diary, which covers 
the period from 1673 to 1729, it must needs 
give us many a peep into Puritan family, social, 
and public life, through the eyes of one who 
saw them in person. Letters and writings of 
the Winthrops and the Mathers, with other 
sources of information, are freely drawn upon, 
and the whole has been compiled with such 
scholarly care and loving zeal that one more is 
now added to the useful series of studies in 
Puritan life and history which have, in recent 
years, appeared from the pens of Dr. George 
E. Ellis, Mrs. Alice Morse Earle, Mr. Frank 
Samuel Child, Mr. Douglas Campbell, and 
other workers in this ever-fruitful field. In 
passing, it is worth while to note the totally 
different point of view and conclusions of Mr. 
Chamberlain's book and the once much-lauded 
" Puritan in Holland, England, and America."

country at the time of the Puritan exodus con- 
tains many a quaint and curious touch. A poor 
widow, asking the parish clerk the price of a 
funeral sermon for her husband, is told that 
some are 10s., and one is as low as 7s. 6^., 
which last, however, no one would ever know 
to be a funeral sermon ; but that if she pays 
for one of the guinea sermons, there will not be 
a dry eye in the house. In those good old days 
of abundant leisure the post coach would some- 
times agree with its passengers beforehand to 
stop over at any town on the way where a cock- 
fight was in progress. It was nineteen days 
after Cromwell had been made Protector before 
the bells were rung in Bridgewater. Trades- 
men from the Provinces commonly made their 
wills before going up to London, and then often 
walked the entire distance in that same solemn 
frame of mind in which Sewall describes him- 
self as returning through vivid perils from a 
trip to Cambridge or Roxbury Neck, noting his 
safe home-coming with a devout " Laus Deo " 
in his diary. 

Chapters on " The Puritan Exodus," " Sewall 
and the Puritan Church," and " Sewall and 
the Commonwealth," are followed by one on 
" Sewall as a Business Man," which shows 
him to have been shrewd and cautious in all 
commercial dealings. His education at Har- 
vard naturally marked him for the ministry, 
and he did preach a few times, on one occasion 
delivering a sermon of two and one-half hours' 
duration good measure even for those times. 

The pictures of Indian warfare disclose many 
harrowing scenes. Mrs. Rowlandson, wife of 
the minister of Lancaster, shows us what man- 
ner of men they were who settled New England, 
when she speaks of some little children who, 
on being captured with their mother by the 
Indians, " did not shed one tear, but prayed all 
the while when their mother was killed and 
burnt before them." In his views on the treat- 
ment of both Indians and negroes, Judge 
Sewall was far in advance of his times, and 
many of his words of warning ring with a singu- 
larly prophetic note. The author, by a curious 
argument in the appendix, claims that " neither 
the Puritans of New England nor their descend- 
ants are responsible for the gradual extinction 
of the New England Indians." The introduc- 
tion of disease, " the importation of civilized 
microbes into heathen lands," is made to bear 
the blame : for further particulars see Darwin's 
" Voyage of the Beagle " and Koch's researches 
on microbes. And yet it will not be at once 
admitted that the importation of gunpowder 



and whiskey did not play a large part in the 
extermination of Poor Lo. It would be inter- 
esting, if space permitted, to compare the totally 
different methods and degrees of success of 
the Puritan missionary movement among the 
Indians and that of the French Jesuits, both 
representing the same great church. The Jesuit 
fathers shared the life and hardships of their 
converts, living in the same wigwams, eating 
the same coarse fare, and paddling in the same 
canoes with them ; but even so generous a soul 
as the apostle Eliot, when he spent the Sabbath 
in Natick, took with him food prepared by his 
wife and dwelt apart in a chamber fitted up in 
his meeting-house. 

The chapter on the Salem Witchcraft shows 
Sewall in an unfavorable light, although he 
afterward sorrowfully acknowledged his error 
in subscribing to a foolish superstition. 

In reading those portions of the work devoted 
to the Puritan domestic and social life, with all 
its dreary asceticism, one is reminded of Macau- 
lay's well-known utterance to the effect that 
the Puritans " hated bear-baiting, not because 
it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave 
pleasure to the spectators." Dancing, cards, 
music, were all forbidden ; while their few books 
were so dull that conversation with a cow would 
have been a refreshing stimulant in comparison. 

But in the chapter on " Betty Sewall and 
Puritan Marriages," human nature or at 
least woman nature is seen to have been much 
the same then as now ; while the account, as 
taken from his diary, of Se wall's flirtations, 
marriages, and other amatory escapades, after 
the death of his first wife in 1717 when he 
himself was sixty- five years old demonstrates 
the traditional superiority of an old fool's folly 
over that of a young one. Like many people 
who have launched into autobiography, this 
aged charmer does not know when to close his 
diary, and his biographer thinks it only right 
to punish him for his indiscretion by giving to 
the world some of his later entries along with 
the rest. Shall we regard his autumnal frivol- 
ity as one more proof that human nature will 
not be denied its rights, and, if forced to con- 
form to a strait-laced Puritanism in its spring- 
time, will kick up its heels in old age? 

The book is well illustrated with portraits 
and other cuts, and provided with an appendix 
of interesting matter, but has no index, which 
is really demanded by its 319 pages of miscel- 
laneous material, nor any list of authorities, 
which would have been welcome to the student.

TRAVEL.S VARIOUS.* 

In the middle Orient lies idyllic and pictur- 
esque Burma, a paradisaic land, where winter 
and want never invade. Thus we may sum- 
marize the impression we gain from the sumpt- 
uous volume by Mrs. Ernest Hart, entitled " Pic- 
turesque Burma." This is the first general work 
of importance on Burma since Scott's " Burma 
as it Was, Is, and Will Be " (1886), a useful 
book, though not quoted in Mrs. Hart's rather 
meagre list of authorities. " Picturesque Bur- 
ma " gives a clear summary account of the coun- 
try and the people, their customs, religion, and 
history. Mrs. Hart's travels were not exten- 
sive, and in her description of the country, as 
elsewhere, she relies much on Yule and other 
writers. She describes from report, but in 
apparent good faith, "the deadly pangu spider " 
as striking " the serpent with its poison fang, 
and outvenoming the most venomous in hate," 
sucking " the brains of its victim." As a 
sample of the book, we quote Mrs. Hart's ac- 
count of Burmese women. 

" Women in Burma are probably freer and happier 
than they are anywhere else in the world. Though 
Burma is bordered on one side by China, where women 
are held in contempt, and on the other by India, where 
they are kept in the strictest seclusion, Burmese women 
have achieved for themselves and have been permitted 
by their men to attain a freedom of life and action that 
has no parallel among Oriental peoples. The secret 
lies, perhaps, in the fact that the Burmese woman is 
active and industrious, while the Burmese man is indo- 
lent and often a recluse. Becoming, therefore, both 
by taste and by habit the money-earner, the bargainer 
and the financier of the household, she has asserted and 
obtained for herself the right to hold what she wins and 
the respect due to one who can and does direct and con- 
trol. Things are strangely reversed in Burma, for here 
we see man as the religious soul of the nation and 
woman its brain. Burmese women are born traders, 
and it is more often the wife than the husband who

drives the bargain with the English buyer for the paddy 
harvest, or, at any rate, she is present on the occasion 
and helps her easy-going husband to stand firm. So 
highly is trading esteemed, that a daughter of well-to- 
do parents, and even a young married woman, will set 
up a booth in the bazaar, and, dressed in a bright silk 
tamein (skirt) and white jacket, with a flower jauntily 
stuck into her coiled black tresses, she will start every 
morning with a tray of sweetmeats, fruit, or toys on 
her head, and, with a gaiety and grace born of the sun- 
shine and the bounteousness of the land, will push a 
brisk trade all through the short and sunny day. The 
earnings thus made are the woman's own, and cannot 
be touched by her husband." 

The author concludes her very optimistic book 
with these remarks : 

" The long independence of the Burmese nation, the 
absence of caste, the free position of the women, the 
ethical and non-idolatrous character of the Buddhist 
religion, the freedom from the thraldom of a priest- 
hood, have combined to make Burma as distinctive in 
character from Hindu nationalities as is Japan. To be 
passed under the rule of the English, to be freed from 
tyranny, to be taught good government, is a happy fate 
for Burma. As the country improves in population, in 
wealth, and in education, it may in the far future re- 
cover its lost nationality, and, freed from ancient Bur- 
mese tyranny and cruelty, give the world the example 
of a people who know how to be happy without caring 
incessantly to toil, and to be joyous without desiring 
insatiably to possess." 

But it will certainly occur to many readers 
of even this book that the Burmese are so weak 
a people that they are destined to be absorbed 
and obliterated lay the Chinese and English. 
Mrs. Hart does not regard missionary work 
with great favor, though the work of the 
American Baptists among the Karens is highly 
praised. On the whole Mrs. Hart's work can 
be commended as a popular and pleasant sketch, 
although she gives little that is really new, and 
her treatment is not very thorough. The book 
is provided with good maps and illustrated with 
excellent photogravures and woodcuts. 

" The New Africa " is the ambitious title of 
the next volume on our list of travels. How- 
ever, the really new Africa explored by the 
writers, Messrs. Aurel Schulz and August Ham- 
mar, was only a small section of the Chobe and 
Okovanga rivers in the central part of South 
Africa ; and the real interest in this work does 
not lie in its rather meagre scientific results, but 
rather in its excellence as a narrative of adven- 
ture and sport. The authors' many adventures 
with savage beasts and men are detailed in a 
simple, direct, unassuming way, without any pre- 
tentious and strained literary art, and yet with 
a natural spontaneous vividness which is very 
attractive. Mr. Schulz fell in with a tribe of 
giants where he had " the most novel experi- 
ence " of being " a small man in a crowd, as the

six foot two inches I stand in my socks generally 
reverses the position in other society." The 
men of this tribe were all nearly seven feet 
tall. Again, he describes the very strange and 
amusing method by which some naked savages 
keep warm. 

" They build themselves little oblong frameworks of 
green wood, sixteen inches high, on top of which they 
made fires. Sleeping under this for warmth, the burn- 
ing embers often fell through the framework on their 
naked skins, raising blisters, which, when healed, left the 
affected part white or grey. It is from this circum- 
stance, widely spread in South Africa, that the Boers 
have humorously nicknamed the tribes living west of the 
Transvaal ' Vaalpense,' or ' grey bellies.' " 

The authors give a very interesting account 
of Victoria Falls, which has " at least four times 
the volume of water and over three times the 
height " of Niagara, and which " burst on one's 
sensibilities immediately with appalling grand- 
eur." Altogether, despite some inelegancies of 
style, this work is quite the best book of adven- 
ture and sport we have met for some time. The 
volume contains a route map, which will mean 
little to general readers, and should be supple- 
mented by a complete map of South Africa. 
The illustrations are for the most part fairly 
good. One illustration with accompanying re- 
marks, and also some later remarks on a mal- 
formation, are more suited to a medical work 
than to one intended for popular circulation. 

Another book on South Africa, but of quite 
a different order, is Mr. James Bryce's " Im- 
pressions of South Africa," of which the readers 
of the " Century Magazine " have already had 
a taste. This book is of the same kind as the 
author's famous " American Commonwealth," 
though on a much smaller scale, and shows the 
same acuteness and care, the same judicious 
temper and comprehensiveness of view, the 
same clear and luminous style. The work on 
South Africa consists of a short account of the 
country and people, a historical summary, and 
some notes of travel, the whole forming much 
the most reliable and useful general account 
that has yet appeared. Mr. Bryce finds in 
the mining and ranch country a frontier life 
which he contrasts favorably with frontier life 
in the United States, and he looks in the near 
future to great prosperity for a South African 
Confederation under the suzerainty of Great 
Britain. Mr. Bryce's studies were made in 
1895, but the book has been brought down to 
date. The maps, physical and political, are 
very useful features. 

Mr. Poultney Bigelow's "White Man's 
Africa " is made up of papers that have ap- 



peared in " Harper's Magazine," and gives in 
pleasant form the result of the author's personal 
observations in a brief trip through English, 
Portuguese, and Boer South Africa. The Boer 
question is treated at some length. Mr. Bige- 
low made the acquaintance of President Kruger, 
whom he characterizes thus : 

" Kruger is the incarnation of local self-government 
in its purest form. He is president among his burghers 
by the same title that he is elder in his church. He 
makes no pretention to rule them by invoking the law, 
but he does rule them by reasoning with them until they 
yield to his superiority in argument. He rules among 
free burghers because he knows them well and they 
know him well. He knows no red-tape nor pigeon-holes. 
His door is open to every comer; his memory recalls 
every face; he listens to every complaint, and sits in 
patriarchal court from six o'clock in the morning until 
bedtime. He is a magnificent anachronism. He alone 
is equal to the task of holding his singular country to- 
gether in its present state. His life is the history of 
that state. Already we hear the rumblings that indicate 
for the Transvaal an earthquake of some sort. We pray 
they may not disturb the declining years of that coun- 
try's hero the patient, courageous, forgiving, loyal, 
and sagacious Paul Kruger." 

Mr. Bigelow speaks severely of Portuguese 
misgovernment, but he has much praise for 
Orange Free State, Cape of Good Hope, and for 
Natal, "the Colonial Paradise." The book con- 
tains historical matter of value, and two folk- 
lore stories that will interest the anthropologist. 
The chief criticism that we have to offer is that 
the book is too obviously a rather hasty "write- 
up," and too journalistic in quality. The 
numerous illustrations are well drawn and very 
interesting. 

The well-known English archaeologist, Mr. 
W. M. Ramsay, modestly entitles his latest vol- 
ume " Impressions of Turkey "; but, as a m atter of 
fact, we find here, not what many readers might 
expect, superficial and rapid notes, but close and 
careful studies of Turkish life and character, 
which are the fruit of twelve years of observa- 
tion in manifold wanderings through Asia 
Minor. In a suggestive, thoughtful, impartial, 
yet sympathetic way, he describes and discusses 
the Turk and other Mohammedan races, the 
Armenian, the Greek, and the American mis- 
sionary and his adherents. As to the latter, we 
may well quote a sentence or two from the pre- 
face to the American edition of Mr. Ramsay's 
work : 

" My hope is that this book may do something to pro- 
duce in America an adequate conception of the great 
educational organization which the American mission- 
aries have built up in Turkey with admirable foresight 
and skill. Beginning with a prejudice against their 
work, I was driven by the force of facts and experience 
to the opinion that the mission has been the strongest,

as well as the most beneficent, influence in causing the 
movement toward civilization which has been percept- 
ible in varying degrees among all the peoples of Turkey, 
but which has been zealously opposed and almost arrested 
by the present Sultan with the support of the Six Euro- 
pean Powers." 

As to the Armenian massacres, Mr. Ramsay 
writes : 

" There has been no exaggeration in the worst ac- 
counts of the horrors of Armenia. A writer with the 
vivid imagination 'of Dumas, and the knowledge of evil 
that Zola possesses, could not attain, by any description, 
the effect that the sight of one massacre in the Kurdish 
part of Armenia would produce on any spectator. The 
Kurdish part of Armenia is the ' black country.' It has 
been a charnal house. One dare not enter it. One can- 
not think about it. One knows not how many maimed, 
mutilated, outraged Armenians are still starving there." 

Mr. Ramsay's book is clearly and pleasantly 
written. He is a man of very careful and 
catholic observation and judgment, and he 
comes, perhaps, nearer than any recent writer 
to the truth about Turkey. 

The American publishers of Taine's works, 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., have issued, in uni- 
form style with their previous edition, a volume 
by him entitled "Journeys through France." 
This book consists of notes evidently made by 
M. Taine, while on his journeys as examiner 
in law for the provinces. Such provincial cities 
as Douai, Rennes, Bourdeaux, Toulouse, Mar- 
seilles, are sharply and clearly characterized 
from the Tainesque point of view, that is, as 
influenced by environment. Thus on Douai 
and its vicinity he remarks: " These are verita- 
ble low countries, and that implies everything, 
morally and physically." Among many acute 
and suggestive remarks on art we quote this : 

" Nowadays, painters recognize the violent, strange, 
or poetic side of nature; but their peasants are no more 
than physiological studies. The future in every art is 
for such as select or meet with subjects which all suc- 
ceeding generations will approve. Happiness is one of 
these themes, but nervous disorders and psychological 
peculiarities are not amongst them. I could not perceive 
the beauty of happiness until I was well advanced in life. 
In the early days this did not come home to me, or I 
thought it stale." 

While this book is not one of Taine's best, 
yet it is of considerable interest as a series of 
literary etchings of French provincialism. Yet 
in this work, as in others by him, we often feel 
that he is over analytic and over reflective in 
his positive type of mind ; and yet again we 
often feel that he is only a high type of dilet- 
tante, seeking experience for its own sake, and 
revelling in a soft and sad sensuousness. The 
woodcuts in this volume are of the old-fashioned 
picturesque style, and in some cases, as that of 
Rennes, scarcely illustrate the text. 



M. Rene Bazin, a French litterateur of note, 
has written an agreeable and instructive little 
book on "The Italians of To-day." These 
notes show a Frenchman's keenness of percep- 
tion and clearness of expression, touching 
luminously and freshly on the condition of in- 
dustry, politics, literature, and art, in various 
parts of Italy. M. Bazin's sympathetic sociality 
and urbanity, and his artistic appreciation, are 
everywhere apparent. A delicate impressionism 
and graceful sentimentality abound ; though 
sometimes the former is too sketchy, and the 
latter too effusive. And yet the author is quite 
able to deal with plain facts in a prosaic and 
scientific way, as we see, for instance, in his 
account of Italian taxation. Perhaps the best 
thing in the book is the quite full and interesting 
description of the little-visited Roman Cam- 
pagna, from which we extract this pretty etch- 
ing as a sample of the author's description : 

" On my way back to the city I saw a splendid sight. 
In a field which was axe-shaped, broadening in the dis- 
tance, fifteen pair of gray oxen were ploughing in line. 
The fifteen ploughs were exactly aligned, opening and 
throwing out earth which was a reddish-purple color. 
These are the same implements of husbandry that Ver- 
gil saw, an iron wedge, two wooden wings in front of 
a joist, a round platform behind, traversed by an upright 
stick. On the platform stands the laborer, with one 
hand holding by the upright, with the other using the 
goad. And these beautiful, primitive forms of labor, 
the immense oxen, the small plough, the man, motion- 
less and stately, were moving slowly forward, leaving 
half the field furrowed and steaming behind them." 

While this book does not pretend to a com- 
plete discussion of its subject, it will yet be of 
service, and by reason of its style it cannot fail 
to amuse and interest. 

Miss Eliza Scidmore, in " Java, the Garden 
of the East," the contents of which have in part 
appeared in the " Century Magazine," gives a 
facile and agreeable though not especially note- 
worthy sketch of the Java of to-day. Her travel 
was confined to a trip over the line of railway 
which the Dutch have constructed through the 
center of Java, and much of the volume is of 
the guide-book order a general description 
with little personal flavor. However, her pic- 
ture of Java is clear, and seems correct as far 
as it goes. The island is about the size of the 
state of New York, and yet contains 24,000,000 
inhabitants, who have made its whole country 
a veritable garden. " All Java is in a way as 
finished as little Holland itself, the whole island 
cultivated from edge to edge like a tulip-garden, 
and connected throughout its length with post- 
roads smooth and perfect as park drives, all 
arched with waringen, kanari, tamarind, or teak

trees. The rank and tangled jungle is invisible, 
save by long journeys ; and great snakes, wild 
tigers, and rhinoceroses are almost unknown 
now. One must go to Borneo and the farther 
islands to see them, too." In short we see " the 
tropics tamed, combed, and curbed, hitched to 
the cart of commerce and made mart's abject 
servant." Miss Scidmore's descriptions of the 
ruins at Boro Boeder and Brambanam are per- 
haps the most valuable portion of the book. 
The photographic illustrations are quite suc- 
sessful. 

The volume called " In Journeyings Oft " 
is distinctly a missionary book, recording the 
travels, in 1894, of Mrs. Mary C. Nind, as an 
officer of the Woman's Methodist Missionary 
Society, visiting mission stations in Japan, 
China, Burma, and India. It is well written 
and illustrated, and will be of special service 
to missionary societies. The book is introduced 
to the public by Mrs. Nind's kinsman the well- 
known Bishop Nind. 

" With a Pessimist in Spain " is the playful 
title, referring to a companion in a tour through 
Spain, which Miss Mary F. Nixon has chosen 
for a brief and agreeable book of travels. The 
story of a commonplace tour is told in a famil- 
iar, humorous vein, and in a brisk conversa- 
tional form, whereby the author adroitly pops 
instructive pills from the guide-book into the 
unsuspecting reader's mind. Bright, pleasant, 
lively as it is, we feel sometimes that it is too 
strenuously entertaining. The style is some- 
times a bit careless in a feminine way, as when 
she informs us that " the Pessimist is a dear, 
but she is not built for dignity." The illus- 
trations are good, and the book as a whole will 
serve as a popular account of the regions visited.

A MONUMENTAL, BIRD BOOK.* 



The past two or three years have been pro- 
lific of works on Ornithology meriting unre- 
served approval. The student in this branch of 
natural history need have no future difficulty 
in selecting a treatise suited to his needs. From 
a varied and admirable series, the novice and 
the expert may now make his choice. 

At the head of the list, for purposes of refer- 
ence, stands the recently completed " Diction-

Hans Qadow. With contributions from Richard Lydekker, 
Charles S. Roy, and Robert W. Shufeldt, M.D. New York :

ary of Birds," by Dr. Alfred Newton, Professor 
of Zoology and Biology in Magdalene College, 
Cambridge. The work has been in process of 
publication at the press of Messrs. Adam and 
Charles Black of Edinburgh, since 1889, four 
several parts being issued at varying intervals, 
the final one bearing the date of 1897. In its 
completed form, the book, a large octavo, com- 
prises nearly 1100 pages. The Introduction, 
extending through 120 pages, is in itself worth 
the price of the volume, presenting as it does 
a detailed account of the growth of ornithology 
from its obscure beginnings in the time of Aris- 
totle to its present stage of active development. 
The reader is impressed by the author's firm 
grasp of his subject, and by the calm and im- 
partial judgment manifest in handling it. No 
point is left untouched in the delineation, and 
in each instance due acknowledgment is made 
of the services of the contributor who has lent 
appreciable aid to the advance of the science. 
This masterly Introduction compresses into a 
clear and comprehensive view the whole history 
of ornithology down to the latest date. 

The body of the dictionary is composed 
mainly of the articles prepared by Professor 
Newton originally for the British Encyclopedia. 
These have been, where necessary, enlarged and 
re-shaped to admit the latest facts and conclu- 
sions pertaining to their respective topics. The 
special department of ornithic anatomy has been 
given into the hands of Dr. Hans Gadow, whose 
name certifies to the ability with which it has 
been managed. Other collaborators who have 
added value and variety of interest to the work 
are Mr. Lydekker and Professor Ray, the 
one a pupil, the other a colleague of Professor 
Newton, and Dr. Shufeldt, formerly of the 
United States Army. The articles, arranged 
in alphabetical order, are uniformly concise, 
crowding into the smallest space the largest 
amount of information allowed by the dimen- 
sions of the work. It is fair to say that not a 
bird which may reasonably claim mention has 
been omitted from the catalogue of definitions, 
while the myriad names used early or late in 
the classification of species will be found each 
in its proper place. The extent of the infor- 
mation conveyed may be inferred without fur- 
ther detail. A map accompanying the long 
and able essay on the geographical distribution 
of birds, and a considerable number of engrav- 
ings interspersed through the text, complete 
the usefulness of what may be justly denomi- 
nated a monumental work.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



THE TOUCHSTONE OF FACT IN MATTERS OF 
STYLE.* 

Like the contests of Homeric heroes are the 
word-battles of Dr. Fitzedward Hall and Mr. R. 
O. Williams. Ordinary persons stand amazed 
as they lightly handle weapons which ten com- 
mon men could hardly lift, and sustain the 
most brain-stunning shocks with result only of 
the most annihilating ripostes. We think of 
no equals to them since the days of Dr. John- 
son and Home Tooke, or perhaps we should 
go back to Socrates and Cratylus, and even of 
these we must gain a notion at second-hand 
from the photographs of Landor and Plato. 
Our modern method is to preserve such en- 
counters in the kinetoscope ; Mr. Williams's 
publication of some of his letters, with Dr. 
Hall's replies, makes us absolute spectators. 

The range of this interesting book is not very 
great : some half a dozen questions only are 
exploited, and these are of a minor character. 
Known to, none but they, the imperfect passive, 
in or at with place names, to part with, every and 
each, these, and " the American dialect," are 
the chief topics. Knowledge on them is pleas- 
ant, but it is not too much to say that we could 
live, write, and speak happily without discom- 
forting ourselves very much on their account. 

But, actually, a book like this has a far 
greater import than might appear at first sight. 
It marks a point well worth noting in the 
speaking and writing of correct English. Some 
nations have definite authorities that can be 
appealed to in disputed cases ; we have none. 
Our principle of leaving to private enterprise 
all that government is not compelled to assume 
as a charge, has left the regulating our speech 
to the private effort of grammarians and lexi- 
cographers, and no one of these powers being, 
as such, of any especial authority (despite the 
most vigorous advertisement and commenda- 
tion), one and all take their stand on the rock 
of " good usage." Other considerations may 
enter into discussion, but this is the great 
foundation stone, or, more accurately, touch- 
stone. Hence the importance in any given 
case of knowing what good usage is. In many 
cases the fact (carefully hidden from sight) is 
that "good usage" is a kind of Mrs. Harris: 
" there's no sich person." But often it would 
seem that there is a sort of instinct among 
good writers which leads them in any particu- 
lar case to follow one mode of expression 

* SOME QUESTIONS OF GOOD ENGLISH. By Ralph Olm- 
sted Williams. New York: Henry Holt & Co. 



rather than another. Now, curiously enough, 
in disputed cases, not only are the disputants 
very often ignorant of what good usage is, but 
they usually make no serious effort to find it 
out. This, however, is just what Mr. Williams 
and Dr. Hall do, in as many cases as a good 
God gives them strength to compass. Mr. 
Williams gives twenty-four citations from as 
many authors to show the use of each, thirty- 
three citations to illustrate misplacement of 
only. Dr. Hall mentions fifty-nine respecta- 
ble writers since 1820, in discussing the imper- 
fect passive. Such work certainly gives an 
example of thoroughness. It shows how men 
ought to read if they would know how good 
writers express themselves ; it shows the basis 
upon which opinions as to correct diction 
should rest; it shows what "good usage" 
ought to mean. We are far too apt to fancy 
that two or three examples will settle the mat- 
ter enough for our purposes. 

From this point of view Mr. Williams's book 
is valuable. Interesting it is, too, and often 
amusing* (neither of these gladiators is with- 
out a sense of humor), and certainly a book 
that one likes to have. But beyond this, it is 
a noteworthy book, for it gives a better idea 
than the average reader has of what is meant, 
or should be meant, by " good usage."

HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS. 

i. 

Herr Sienkiewicz's highly successful novel " Quo 
Vadis " comes to us from Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. in two shapely octavo volumes resplendent 
in the Holiday pomp of rich purple-and-gold bind- 
ings, and liberally strewn with full-page illustra- 
tions in photogravure. The artists are Messrs. 
Howard Pyle, E. H. Garrett, and Evert Van Muy- 
den. Of these gentlemen the one last named seems 
to us to have done the best work. His drawings 
have a strength which Mr. Garrett's nearly always 
lack, and they are superior to Mr. Pyle's as pic- 
torial efforts of the historic imagination. Old Rome 
seems to live again in such plates of Mr. Van Muy- 
den's as "The Rescue of Lygia" and "Nero's 
Chained Lions and Tigers." Mr. Garrett's draw- 
ings are pretty and graceful, as they usually are, 
and Mr. Pyle's show a lively, if not at all times a 
sound, fancy. Some of Mr. Pyle's work is so good 
that one is impelled to wonder the more at such 
aberrations, for example, as the central figure of his 
"The Conversion of Chilo." Besides the drawings 
of the artists just named there are several plates 



1897.] 



THE DIAL,

from photographs of ancient busts and edifices, 
famous historical paintings, etc. The pictorial aver- 
age is good, and we are glad to note the inclusion 
of several maps and architectural plans that will 
greatly assist intelligent reading. Altogether the 
edition is a very attractive and tasteful one, and 
should prove one of the successes of the season. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers issue in a fine tall 
folio volume entitled "All Hands," the series of 
pictures of life in the United States Navy, hy Mr. 
R. F. Zogbaum, which have during the past year 
or so formed a striking feature of some of the firm's 
serial publications. Everybody is more or less fa- 
miliar with Mr. Zogbaum's realistic and spirited 
work, which is as distinctly sui generis and as easily 
recognizable as is that of Mr. Remington or Mr. 
Gibson. It is evident throughout the present series 
of plates that the artist has a very warm place in- 
deed in his heart for " Jack " who is, he thinks, 
despite the fact that he goes down to sea nowadays, 
not in ships, but in floating forts or colossal tanks 
("tea-kettles," Farragut called them), very much 
the same sort of jovial, free-handed chap that he 
was " in Rodney's day." We should say that " Jack " 
of to-day is much more of a mechanic and rather 
less of a sailor than were the pig-tailed " Tom Bowl- 
ings " and " long Tom Coffins " of yore. But if he 
can't " reef, furl, and handle," and " sailorize " gen- 
erally, as well as his salter predecessors could, he 
hasn't forgotten the art of " splicing the main-brace," 
as some of Mr. Zogbaum's pictures indicate. The 
series is both instructive and entertaining. It deals 
with every phase of life aboard the modern man-of- 
war, ranging from grave to gay, from peace to war, 
from cabin to forecastle. It shows us Jack afloat 
and Jack ashore ; Jack at work and Jack at play ; 
Jack "sky-larking" in the Dog Watch, and Jack 
standing at the gangway beside the bier of a mess- 
mate who has slipped his cable for the other world ; 
it shows us Jack dining, bathing, boat-racing, hig- 
gling with the "bumboat women," and what not. 
There is no text save a brief general introduction 
on the modern battle-ship and the American naval 
question in general. Mr. Zogbaum is naturally of 
opinion that if we are going to have a navy at all, 
we ought to have an effective one one in fact as 
well as in name, and one to be proud of rather than 
ashamed of. A cheap navy breeds contempt and 
insult in time of peace, and disaster in time of war. 
Washington's maxim, "To be prepared for war is 
the most effectual means to promote peace," is 
worth weighing ; and the greatly improved condi- 
tion of our navy to-day ought to be a source of satis- 
faction to every American. Mr. Zogbaum's lively 
pictures afford us an excellent means of studying 
the life on board of "Uncle Sam's" new ironclads, 
and the publishers have grouped them conveniently 
in one of the season's handsomest gift-books. 

In his preface to " Drawings by Frederic Rem- 
ington" (R. H. Russell), Mr. Owen Wister tries to 
analyze the charm of the far West. It eludes him, 
as he knew it would, except so much as he expresses 



in the phrase, " escaped back to nature." " The 
silence of that world," he says, " seems to have 
come unbroken from behind Genesis, to have been 
earlier than the beginning, to make one with the 
planets, to have known mysteries that dwindle Rome 
to a show." It is perhaps only to the initiated that 
such phrases are not hyperbole ; one must have 
been thrilled by the plains themselves to realize 
their profound significance. But those who have 
known the life of the ranches are always com- 
rades, as Mr. Wister points out ; and to them this 
book of Mr. Remington's will appeal with peculiar 
force. Interest in it may be languid for others, but 
not for them. And they know that the artist, also, 
has felt "the nameless magic of the plains." 
There is something more than realism in many of 
these pictures ; there is an imaginative grasp of the 
situation. Behind the poverty and loneliness, the 
activity and daring of this life, Mr. Remington sees 
its color, its poetry. Upon him, too, " the wilder- 
ness has set its spell." In such drawings as " The 
Pony War-Dance " and " The Coming Storm " he 
expresses something of the mystery, the primitive 
Titanic grandeur, of the race that is passing away. 
In these, and in " Hostiles Watching the Column " 
and " The Missionary and the Medicine Man," he 
unites man with the elements, and he seems to 
bring the pitiful solitude into conjunction with the 
rest of the world. Yet there are other drawings in 
which the realism is almost photographic, and it is 
not in them that we find the many evidences of 
growth. Mr. Remington has done much, also, for 
the ranchman and the soldier, and in both he gives 
us the real thing. These are no play cowboys, 
prettily decked out in sombreros and chaparreros. 
Like the soldiers, they have seen hard service, and 
one feels absolute confidence in their ability to rope 
a steer or break a broncho. When all this wild pic- 
turesque life shall have passed away, this record of 
Mr. Remington's will have enormous historical value. 
Professor W. M. Sloane's elaborately mounted 
" Life of Napoleon Bonaparte " (Century Co.) 
comes to an end with Volume IV., now before us. 
With the general style and quality of the work our 
readers are doubtless already tolerably familiar. 
Without displaying any marked force or grace of 
narration, it maintains a respectable level of literary 
merit throughout. The chief value of the work 
springs from the author's intimate knowledge of his 
theme in all its details. He tells his story directly, 
without rhetorical flourish, and with a constant view 
to the tastes and capacities of the average magazine 
reader. The Life is, therefore, an excellent one for 
popular reading ; and as such we cordially recom- 
mend it. Its sumptuous setting makes it a desirable 
gift-book of the more expensive sort. Professor 
Sloane's conception of Napoleon is rational and im- 
partial, he having plainly divested his mind of the 
stock exaggerations of the Napoleonic legend. The 
present volume, opening with the retreat from Mos- 
cow and closing with the final scene at St. Helena, 
treats in full detail such events as the crossing of

the Beresina, the rise of the nations, the end of the 
Grand Army, the invasion of France, the fall of 
Paris, Elba, Ligny, Quatre Bras, Waterloo. A list 
of historical sources is appended. The illustrations 
comprise nineteen full-page plates in color after his- 
torical paintings by Orchardson, Flameng, Geri- 
cault, Berne-Bellecour, Vernet, Meissohier, etc., to- 
gether with plates prepared especially for the work 
by Myrbach. The volume is well supplied with 
maps. While the pictures (serving the end of em- 
bellishment rather than instruction) do not exactly 
meet our views of the proper illustration of history, 
they are generally beautiful and striking in them- 
selves, and lend the work a distinct character and 
attractiveness as a Holiday publication. Messrs. 
McDonnell Bros., of Chicago, are the general agents 
for the work. 

Among the many well-known works that appear 
this season in a holiday edition, Irving's " Astoria " 
is given a conspicuous place. It is presented in the 
elaborate style of decoration and embellishment 
adopted by its publishers (Putnam) for their an- 
nual holiday selection from Irving's works, the num- 
ber for this year being appropriately called the " Ta- 
coma " edition. It is published in two volumes, with 
a good cover in red brown and gold on white, and 
is illustrated with numerous photogravures based 
chiefly on photographs and representing the work 
of Messrs. Church, Beard, Zogbaum, Eaton, and 
other artists. Each page of text is framed in a col- 
ored decorative border, the work of Miss Margaret 
Armstrong. The result is a striking presentation of 
the famous " anecdotes of an enterprise beyond the 
Rocky Mountains." 

Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons have chosen for 
their leading holiday work this year Mr. Cable's 
"Old Creole Days." The volume is clearly and 
tastefully printed, and is given an effective cover 
in grays. Its greatest charm, however, is in the 
drawings, by Mr. Albert Herter, which have marked 
individuality and character. Except in the frontis- 
piece, the rich beauty of the Creole type almost 
eludes the artist. His drawings are delightful, but they 
might represent the North as well as the South. The 
delicacy of the author's differentiation is not quite 
aught. In spite of this, however, the work is one 
of the most beautiful and satisfactory of the holiday 
books of the year. 

Thoreau's " Walden " is republished by Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. in two volumes, with an 
introduction by Mr. Bradford Torrey, himself a 
familiar of the woods. He proclaims at the begin- 
ning that in spite of itself the world likes eccentric 
people. " Its Wisdom is prudence," he says. " Its 
rule of life is to keep on the safe side. Follow the 
path, it says ; take no risks. Yet it admires au- 
dacity, independence, originality, and, after the 
event, applauds nothing so much as a violation of 
its own maxims." In a spirit of sympathy and ad- 
miration Mr. Torrey writes of Thoreau and his work, 
defending him, unnecessarily perhaps, from un- 
worthy attacks, but feeling that " Time, the ultimate 



critic, has taken his part, and is very unlikely to 
forget him in the day of final award." The books 
are well printed, and illustrated with many good 
photogravures, portraits of Thoreau and his 
friends, their homes and his, and landscapes show- 
ing the places he loved and made the world love. 

A new edition of " The Critical Period of Amer- 
ican History, 1783-1789 " (Houghton), by Profes- 
sor John Fiske, is enriched with numerous illustra- 
tions and maps. The text has been carefully revised, 
and the illustrations selected by the author with 
special regard to their historical value. There are 
many portraits, some of which, like the very indi- 
vidual one of James Madison, are quite unfamiliar; 
and many interesting facsimiles of early documents 
and engravings. In addition to these, Mr. Fiske 
has resurrected some curious old caricatures, which 
are eloquent of popular feeling at the time. The 
book is very well printed and bound, and the 
illustrations add greatly to the value of a work 
which without them had no rival. 

Mrs. Maud Wilder Goodwin's historical stories, 
"The Head of a Hundred" and "White Aprons," 
come to us boxed together as a set and in dainty 
Holiday dress, under the joint title "Romances of 
Colonial Virginia" (Little, Brown, & Co.). We 
have had occasion before to praise these wholesome 
and tenderly imaginative tales of the Old Dominion. 
Mrs. Goodwin has done well to turn her serious his- 
torical studies, directly embodied in her capital little 
study of " The Colonial Cavalier," to artistic account. 
The action of the stories is well thought out, the sit- 
uations are effective, and the love-scenes duly tender 
and genuine. The dialogue is fairly animated, and 
just touched with a due degree of archaism 
though here, it must be noted, Mrs. Goodwin's 
little fishes do incline at times to talk like whales 
and just a trifle in the style of the superfine heroes 
and heroines of the eighteenth-century novel. But 
where the whole is so good, critical flaw-picking is 
ungracious ; and we gladly welcome Mrs. Good- 
win's popular tales in their new and seasonable set- 
ting. The volumes are tastily bound in light-green 
ornately stamped in gilt, and' each contains five 
photogravure plates, together with decorative head- 
ings and an ornamental title-page. Altogether the 
little set is most enticing, and should find its way 
to many a Holiday table this season. 

Of the making of books on themes colonial there 
seems now to be no end. The latest writer to ex- 
ploit this prolific field is " Marion Harland," and 
her book, "Some Colonial Homesteads and their 
Stories" (Putnam), is in form and content one of 
the most attractive of its kind. The more or less 
romantic stories that cluster like ancestral ivy round 
the picturesque old houses described by Mrs. Ter- 
hune are told by her with evident gusto and a cer- 
tain old-fashioned preciosity of style that is appro- 
priate enough and not at all unpleasant. The tales 
were gathered during the narrator's visits at the 
houses described ("historical shrines," she calls 
them) ; and she testifies to the " gracious readiness "

of the present representatives of the ancient Van 
Cortlandts, Morrises, Schuylers, Smiths, and so on, 
to place their ancestral parchments and muniments 
of nobility at her disposal even, we presume, with 
the full knowledge that not only was she " amang " 
them with the express purpose of " takin' notes," 
but that, like Captain Grose, she was eke going to 
"prent it." Family records, manuscript letters, old 
portraits, were freely turned over for her inspection ; 
and she is even able to gratify her readers with an 
occasional peep at an interesting ancestral family 
skeleton, in itself no bad title to social distinction ; 
the next best thing socially, as we know, to having 
a particularly good ancestor to point to, being to 
have a particularly bad one. Though the historical 
interest of the book is of course rather slight, Mrs. 
Terhune makes good her claim to the due degree 
of historical accuracy in the framework of recorded 
fact that surrounds her sketches. Among the co- 
lonial homesteads described are the Virginian seats 
of Brandon, Westover, Shirley, etc., the Morris 
House at Germantown, the Schuyler and Colfax 
Houses of New Jersey, the New York manor houses 
of the Van Cortlandts, Livingstones, Philipses, the 
Jumel Mansion, the Pierce House and the " Parson 
Williams" House of Massachusetts, and the Smith 
House of Connecticut. The illustrations comprise 
a great number of views of historic sites and homes, 
architectural details, coats-of-arms, portraits, etc. 
The volume is clearly printed on lightly glazed paper, 
and forms a dainty and acceptable gift-book. 

A book about our own country, which Mr. Edmund 
H. Garrett has written and illustrated, bears the 
rather ponderous title of " Romance and Reality 
of the Puritan Coast " (Little, Brown, & Co.). It 
was written avowedly around the pictures, which are 
certainly the charm of the book ; but it describes in 
the idlest fashion the " north shore " of the Massa- 
chusetts coast, and encourages the art of " strolling 
a-wheel." A little history and a little romance are 
mixed up with the modern wheeling and bathing and 
yachting, and there are occasional delightful pictures 
of the dames and squires of other days. The text 
is very light and very rambling, but it forms an 
appropriate setting for the pretty pictures. 

"Historic New York" (Putnam) is amore serious 
treatment of the lives of our ancestors. It is edited 
by Mrs. Maud Wilder Goodwin, Mrs. Alice Car- 
rington Royce, and Miss Ruth Putnam, and contains 
essays by several other writers who have studied the 
subject. An effort has been made to give an accurate 
and vivid picture of the city of New Amsterdam and 
its people. The idea is an excellent one, and it is 
carried out by the essayists with knowledge and 
skill. There are papers on the State-House, by Mrs. 
Alice Morse Earle ; on the " Early History of Wall 
Street," by Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard ; on " Old 
Greenwich," by Miss Elizabeth Bisland ; on " The 
Fourteen Miles Round," by Mr. Alfred B. Mason 
and Mrs. Mary Murdoch Mason ; and on the Bowery, 
King's College (now Columbia), Governor's Island, 
and several other subjects of interest. The book is 



a useful and timely one, for we are in danger of for- 
getting our Dutch ancestry in our absorption in the 
omniverous Puritan. 

Modestly ornate in form and freshly sweet in 
content are the brace of twin duodecimos severally 
entitled " Travels in a Tree-Top " and " The Free- 
dom of the Fields," and boxed together under the 
joint style, " Fireside and Forest Library " (Lip- 
pincott). The author is Mr. Charles C. Abbott, a 
pleasant writer of the Thoreau-Jefferies-Burroughs 
school, and the volumes contain respectively seven- 
teen and fifteen crisp little papers, largely on sylvan 
scenes and pleasures. Mr. Abbott is by no means 
a mere echo of his perhaps more widely read co- 
laborers, his work having a distinct savor of its 
own, a tang, as it were, like that of wild fruit. To 
read him is to retrace in fancy, and with sharpened 
zest and eyesight, the half-remembered delicious path 
of many a bygone summer or springtide ramble, 
no bad occupation for a winter's night, when the 
lamp is alit and the fire glowing, and the driving 
sleet is drumming at the window-pane, like Winter 
tapping for admission. The volumes are made up 
in the best of taste, and each contains four accept- 
able illustrations by Mrs. Alice Barber Stephens. 

Redolent throughout of the true spirit and signifi- 
cance of the great Christian festival is Dr. Henry 
Van Dyke's sweet and tender old-time story of " The 
First Christmas-Tree " (Scribner). It opens with 
the day before Christmas, in the year of our Lord 
722 ; and is divided into four main scenes or phases : 
The Call of the Woodsman," " The Trail of the 
Forest," "The Shadow of the Thunder - Oak," 
" The Felling of the Tree." In the first scene we 
are shown the peaceful cloister of Pfalzel, on the 
banks of the Moselle. . It is Christmas-eve ; and the 
pious nuns are making holiday, and awaiting with 
fluttered anticipation a famous visitor Winif ried 
of England, called Boniface, the Apostle of Ger- 
many. The chapter closes with the resolve of young 
Prince Gregor, a visitor at the convent and the son 
of the royal Abbess of Pfalzel, to quit the princely 
pomps and vanities of the life then opening out 
before him, and to share the lonely apostolate of 
Winifried among the heathen Germans. In the 
final chapter Winifried and Gregor in the forest fall 
in with a heathen tribe who are about to sacrifice 
(on Christmas-eve) the son of their chief to Thor 
at the foot of the mystic thunder-oak. The arm of 
the Apostle interposes to stay the sacrificial axe in 
its descent ; the boy is saved ; the thunder-oak is 
felled by the missionaries ; the chief and his follow- 
ers accept the sign ; a stately fir is felled at the bid- 
ding of Winifried and borne in triumph to the great 
hall, where it is raised all glittering with tapers to 
serve as " The First Christmas-Tree," while Gregor 
and his companions chant their Christmas hymn : 
" All glory be to God on high, 
And to the earth be peace ! 
Good-will henceforth from heaven to man 
Begin and never cease." 
The book contains four beautiful photogravures

[Dec. 1, 



from designs by Mr. Howard Pyle, which are among 
the best things we remember to have seen from his 
pencil. The volume is prettily bound and well 
printed, and the scroll of oak-leaves and acorns en- 
closing the text on each page has a good effect. 

The special features of Messrs. Fords, Howard 
& Hulbert's pretty Holiday edition of Tennyson's 
"In Memoriam" are Dr. Henry Van Dyke's criti- 
cal and descriptive preface and the profuse deco- 
rative and illustrative drawings by Mr. Harry Fenn. 
The poem lends itself fairly well to illustration, 
and Mr. Fenn has acquitted himself creditably, 
especially in the bits of landscape thrown in here 
and there in accordance with the suggestions of the 
text. The merely decorative drawings, initial letters, 
tail-pieces, and so on, are perhaps a little stiff, and 
hint sometimes at a jaded or a spurred fancy; but 
the effect of the ensemble is pleasing enough, and 
the edition may be commended to readers whose 
enjoyment of " In Memoriam " can be enhanced by 
pictorial aids. Dr. Van Dyke's preface gives a brief 
analysis of the poem in its broader aspects, and re- 
counts the touching story of its origin. The text is 
fairly printed on lightly glazed paper, and the bind- 
ing is dainty and suggestive of the gift-book. 

Two new and sumptuous editions of " The Faerie 
Queene" are encouraging signs that we are not ab- 
sorbed in the modern and the eccentric to the entire 
exclusion of the great poets of old. The more 
beautiful of these editions is illustrated by Mr. 
Walter Crane, and published in London by Mr. 
George Allen, and in New York by the Macmillan 
Co. The work is edited by Mr. Thomas J. Wise, 
who has attempted merely to furnish an accurate 
text. His work has been carefully done, and in his 
preface, besides naming his authorities, he describes 
with many valuable details the various early editions 
of the poem in such a way that collectors may easily 
verify their copies. He prints also the seventeen 
sonnets which were appended to the first edition, 
together with the five stanzas at the end of the 
twelfth canto of Book III., which were suppressed 
in the edition of 1596. The title-pages of the early 
editions are here reproduced in facsimile. The 
selection of an illustrator was particularly happy, 
as Mr. Crane's style is admirably adapted to the 
presentation of Spenser's thought. Mr. Crane him- 
self seems the product of another century than ours ; 
there is something primitive and archaic in his very 
subtlety. He too has the love of fairies and alle- 
gories and of decorative pageantry, which is requisite 
to a true interpretation. It was a great opportunity 
for an artist, and probably no man living could have 
risen to it so sympathetically as Mr. Crane. The 
borders for his pictures are rich in decorative sym- 
bolism, assisting and completing the allegory, and 
forming, with their conventionalized trees and fig- 
ures, an exquisitely beautiful frame. In the designs 
themselves there is great beauty of line and an ad- 
mirable adjustment of contrasts in the blacks and 
whites. Such drawings as the Dance of the Graces, 
Diana's Bath, and Nature and Mutability, possess 



also originality and a rich imaginative grace. They 
are in harmony with the lovely poem they ornament ; 
and if occasionally they seem too sophisticated for 
its simplicity, it is, after all, a subtlety appropriate 
to the poet's imagination. They are serious and 
sincere in feeling, and exquisitely decorative in 
treatment. The edition is limited to one thousand 
copies on unbleached hand-made paper, and twenty- 
eight on Japanese vellum. It has been issued in 
sections, all of which are now out. The edition of 
the same poem published in London by J. M. Dent 
& Co., and imported by the Macmillan Co., is also 
sumptuous, but it has not the rare harmonious 
beauty of the other. The two bulky volumes are of 
an awkward size, and are yet too small for decora- 
tions so elaborate. The artist is Mr. Louis Fairfax 
Muckley ; but his work resembles that of William 
Morris, much coarsened and weakened. The books 
from the Kelmscott press have a beauty of their 
own, but it will not bear imitation. Without sin- 
cerity and appropriateness, without originality of 
thought and fertility of invention, such work is a 
dim and meaningless echo. The decorative use of 
contrasts, the effective balance of light and shade, 
are problems unsolved by this draftsman. In his 
effort to be decorative, he is merely empty and 
stilted, and his simplicity is not the lovely and joy- 
ous simplicity of Spenser. There is a blatant quality 
in the work which is foreign to the poet's sponta- 
neity, which the occasional bad drawing and the 
complicated decorative motives do not help to con- 
ceal. The book is furnished with a critical Intro- 
duction, the English of which is itself open to 
criticism, by Mr. John W. Hales, M.A., professor 
of English literature at King's College, London. 
The edition is limited to 1,350 copies. 

William Morris has much to answer for in these 
holiday books. Mr. W. B. Macdougall, the artist 
who decorated " The Fall of the Nibelungs " (Dent- 
Macmillan), has studied his work too superficially. 
That kind of illustration is only justified by being 
done extremely well ; and no such excuse can be 
offered for the pictures in this book. It seems as 
though one page of William Morris would have 
given a designer more ideas than are displayed in 
all these drawings. The fine old myths are " done 
into English " by Miss Margaret Armour, who calls 
her work a " plain prose rendering." Nevertheless 
her prose is elaborately archaic, her effort to bring 
it close to the original resulting in much that is 
artificial and stilted. Such English cannot be natural 
to us moderns, and sincerity and simplicity, even a 
certain naivete, are its necessary ingredients. A 
rendering in modern English, if it were written with 
ability, with a kind of poetic sympathy, would be 
much nearer the original than these archaisms. But 
one could forgive the writer if her prose were beau- 
tiful. It has no music, no rhythm. She has used 
Simrock's arrangement of the text, and the stories 
themselves are always interesting. They differ 
much, however, from the familiar Wagnerian ver- 
sion. The paper and print of the book are excellent.

The Arthurian legends, also, are given a new 
interpretation. In " King Arthur and the Table 
Bound " (Houghton), the tales are taken chiefly from 
the old French of Crestien of Troyes, whose fame 
has only recently been resurrected. They are trans- 
lated and edited with notes by Mr. William Wells 
Newell, who has written also an introduction deal- 
ing with the history of Arthurian romance and the 
variations it has undergone in passing from hand to 
hand. He finds it to be, " not only in style and decora- 
tion, but also in idea and outline," of French con- 
struction. " Their virtues," he says, " are nearly 
the opposites of qualities which would have found 
favor in British antiquity." To Crestien of Troyes 
he ascribes the merit of largely inventing these ro- 
mances and of giving them color and beauty. In 
comparison with his version, he thinks that all others 
have their points of weakness and ineffectiveness. 
He regrets that Tennyson did not have access to it, 
and shows where he has altered the matter of the 
original legends and their spirit. One of the most 
conspicuous changes was in the character of Gawain, 
who in the old romance was the very essence of 
chivalry. The end of the story of Launcelot and 
Guinevere is also very different in the " Idylls of the 
King," and Arthur's prophetic knowledge of his fate 
and his moralizing over it were unknown to the 
earlier version. Tennyson, however, made no pre- 
tense of accuracy, and any interpretation of such 
stories is inevitably colored by the personality of the 
poet. As Mr. Newell relates them, they are extremely 
interesting. His prose is simple and dignified, and, 
except for an occasional brusqueness, interprets the 
beauty of the old stories sufficiently well. He uses 
no flourishes nor ornament, leaving the poetry that 
lies in the structure of the tales to speak for itself. 
The two volumes are well printed and effectively 
bound in gray and white. 

A third edition, embellished with twenty-four 
finely executed photogravure illustrations, of Herr 
Bernhard Berenson's admirable book on " The 
Venetian Painters of the Renaissance " is published 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons. Herr Berenson's 
appreciations of the great Venetians and the beau- 
ties and peculiarities of their school are luminous 
and penetrating, and altogether worthy of their 
present sumptuous setting. A useful feature is the 
well compiled Index to the paintings of the leading 
Venetian artists, wherein, we are glad to note, doubt- 
ful attributions are clearly and unsparingly indicated. 
The text is handsomely printed on high-class paper, 
and the work forms altogether one of the most 
elegant and substantial gift-books on our list. 

It is nearly fifty years since Mrs. Jonathan Fos- 
ter's translation of Vasari's " Lives of the Painters " 
was published ; and though a volume of notes was 
added to it by Dr. Richter in 1885, the new edition 
of the work issued by Messrs. Charles Scribner's 
Sons is the first attempt to annotate the lives with 
the results of modern criticism. The past twenty 
years have seen a remarkable revival of interest in 
Italian art, and the many critics it has evoked have 



made important changes in our knowledge of the 
lives and works of the artists. The editors, Messrs. 
E. H. and E. W. Blashfield and A. A. Hopkins, in 
their admirable preface, say that " art literature has 
passed through its ages of faith, of personal inspira- 
tion, and has now entered into its age of inquiry." 
Their summary of the method and results of mod- 
ern research is concise and lucid, showing the revo- 
lutionary theories of the " detective school " of 
criticism and the changes it has made in the repu- 
tations of several painters. Nothing that Morelli 
has touched remains quite the same. We may object 
to his intensely material system of identification, 
but we are obliged to accept its results nevertheless. 
This preface indicates, also, the mistakes that Vasari 
has been discovered to have made in the characters 
of certain painters, and it shows especially how much 
Filippo Lippi, Andrea del Sarto and Perugino have 
gained in honor through the single-minded, devoted 
work of scholars. All of these changes are empha- 
sized and elaborated in the copious and well-written 
notes, which also identify some " lost " pictures and 
give much information in regard to the present 
location of works of art described by Vasari. The 
work has been done in the most careful and thor- 
ough manner consistent with an untechnical com- 
mentary upon the text. In order that the material 
might be compressed into four volumes without 
abbreviating the notes, seventy of the most interest- 
ing and important of the biographies were selected, 
those less valuable to the public, and even to the 
student, being omitted. 

There are other books for other art enthusiasts. 
"Sunlight and Shadow" (Baker & Taylor Co.) is 
designed for photographers. Those who have passed 
their novitiate and wish to do serious work with the 
camera are expected to profit by it. The editor, 
Mr. W. I. Lincoln Adams, has collected, from vari- 
ous journals of photography, papers on such ad- 
vanced subjects as lighting, grouping, the choice of 
subject, marines, and night pictures. They are 
written by different experts, who thus give the ama- 
teur the benefit of their special experiences. Beauty 
of style, however, was not considered in making the 
selection, and photographers must be guiltless of a 
sense of humor. It is interesting to learn, for ex- 
ample, that " the introduction of appropriate skies is 
of prime importance in landscape "; and we rather 
like to be assured that "for a rugged mountain 
scene we do not want the calm and serene." The 
book is a little too advanced for the beginner and 
too elementary for the expert. The artist will not 
learn much from suggestions which are either ob- 
vious or too cut-and-dried. The technical informa- 
tion about the camera itself and its relation to its 
subject are useful; but for anything beyond that, 
the student should study rather the great princi- 
ples of art. The book is a quarto, illustrated with 
many good photographs, some of which are also 
artistic.

the Macmillan Co., with illustrations and decorative

designs by Miss Rosie M. M. Pitman. They are charm- 
ing, these drawings, very decorative and very fanci- 
ful. In many of them the artist's imagination seems 
to have entered into that of the writer, so sympathet- 
ically does she express the weird loveliness of the 
story. Even in her handling of line in the exquisite 
little head-pieces, one finds a touch of the unearthly. 
There is much symbolism in the pictures, so much, 
indeed, that the artist prints descriptions of them in 
the index. They are unnecessary, however, for most 
of the drawings have a beauty of their own, inde- 
pendent of such hidden meaning. And symbolism, 
to be justified, should explain itself without literary 
assistance. But the artist does suggest the delicate 
beauty of the allegory. 

An odd little book that is likely to arrest the 
attention of those in quest of a simple gift for a 
young friend is Mr. H. J. Burlingame's "Herrmann 
the Magician" (Laird & Lee). Besides a lively 
sketch of the two Herrmanns, Carl and Alexander, 
and a well written introductory chapter on the 
"Psychology of the Art of Conjuring," it contains 
a clear explanation, with cuts, of the best tricks per- 
formed by the Herrmanns and some other noted 
"wizards." As the author of this portion of the 
book is himself an inventor and maker of conjuring 
apparatus, he may be presumed to know intimately 
whereof he speaks. It may be noted that while 
some of the feats described are very difficult and 
only to be accomplished with the aid of expensive 
and cumbersome apparatus, there are many others 
that, while astounding enough to spectators, are 
comparatively easy of execution and therefore suited 
to parlor entertainments. The explanations of 
such famous stage illusions as the " Rabbit Trick," 
the "Vanishing Lady," the "Magi's Wand," the 
"Decapitation Trick" and so on, should prove in- 
teresting to the thousands who have been mystified 
by them. The sketch of the Herrmanns, especially 
of Alexander Herrmann, whose Mephistophelian 
look greatly belied his genial and singularly chari- 
table heart, is very racy and well leavened with 
stories of the half-impromptu tricks which the con- 
jurers were so fond of playing off at odd times and 
places at the expense of all sorts of people. The 
book is prettily bound in canary-colored Holliston 
cloth, and contains a number of plates, including a 
late portrait of Alexander Herrmann. 

In his "Gondola Days" (Houghton), Mr. F. 
Hopkinson Smith rhapsodizes acceptably, albeit 
much in the old familar vein, about Venice and the 
Venetians. If the somewhat pass&e Queen of the 
Adriatic showed herself to Mr. Smith precisely as 
he depicts her, he is certainly an enviable travel- 
ler. To own a pair of eyes like his, capable of 
transforming so much squalor into splendor, of see- 
ing a worthy relative of the "tuneful gondolier" 
of yore in the swart tatterdemalion who nowadays 
sculls you about in his aquatic hearse, and so on, 
would be worth while. Mr. Smith makes no attempt 
to review the glories of Venetian history or to probe 
present problems. His treatment of his theme is 



picturesque and sentimental, and there is a due 
leaven of humor. For one sojourning for a time 
in Venice the book would form an entertaining and 
a suggestive, and in a small way an informing, com- 
panion. There are a dozen slight but effective 
drawings, and the volume is neatly made. 

The Putnams issue, in attractive holiday garb, 
Edmondo de Amicis' lively and piquant account of 
his experiences on an Italian liner, entitled " On Blue 
Water." The volume contains some 300 pages, and 
there are 60 drawings, full-page and vignette, of 
good quality. In the text, the witty and eloquent 
Italian traveller exploits the humors of his fellow- 
passengers on the " Galileo" in a very amusing way, 
and introduces to his American readers some very 
unfamiliar, not to say grotesque, types. The des- 
criptions are so graphic that the reader begins to 
feel after a chapter or so quite as if he were " on 
blue water " himself, and listening to the chat of this 
most delightful of literary compagnons du voyage. 

One of the most substantial of the season's books 
is " Bird Neighbors " (Doubleday & McClure Co.), 
by Miss Neltje Blanchan. It is furnished with an 
introduction by Mr. John Burroughs, who vouches 
for the accuracy of the work in this science in which 
his word is final. The author has not attempted a 
profound study of the subject ; her object is rather 
to furnish a guide for the uninitiated and the ama- 
teur. She writes of one hundred and fifty of our 
most frequent feathery visitors, classifying them first 
by color, and describing clearly and briefly their 
tricks and manners. Her talk about them has 
vivacity and charm, and shows that she knows her 
world not only with the head, but with the heart. 
To each little life she gives character and individu- 
ality. The value of the book is greatly heightened 
by the colored plates, many of which are surpris- 
ingly beautiful. With their help it would be easy to 
identify most of the flying creatures we see about us. 

To a friend of pronounced "bibliomaniacal" ten- 
dencies, no Christmas gift could be more acceptable 
than a copy of Mr. Irving Browne's " In the Track 
of the Book- Worm," published by the Roycroft 
Printing Shop, of East Aurora, N. Y. Mr. Browne 
is a veteran book-collector and extra-illustrator, and 
his pleasantly-written volume of " thoughts, fancies, 
and gentle gibes on collecting and collectors " makes 
interesting reading. The numerous verses on "book- 
ish" subjects scattered throughout the volume are 
especially good. Like all previous products of the 
Roycroft Press, the volume is mechanically a beauti- 
ful specimen of book-making, and we predict that 
the limited edition in which it is issued will soon be 
exhausted. 

A new edition of " Irish Idylls " (Dodd) is illus- 
trated with many reproductions of photographs and 
drawings by Mr. Clifton Johnson, which serve to 
prove the accuracy of Miss Jane Barlow's descrip- 
tions of the desolate life of the Connemara boglands. 
The pictures have some of the quaint charm of the 
stories, and they give definiteness to our ideas of the 
bogs and the villages that " forbidding environ-

ment " of an unhappy people, which has yet a beauty 
of its own. The cover, by Mr. George Wharton 
Edwards, is good, though the names of the separate 
stories seem an unnecessary and unimaginative 
adornment. 

There is also a well-printed new edition of " The 
Maiden and Married Life of Mary Powell " (after- 
wards Mistress Milton), and the sequel thereto, 
" Deborah's Diary " (imported by Scribner). The 
volume is prettily illustrated by Mr. John Jellicoe 
and Mr. Herbert Railton, and the drawings give 
charming glimpses of the picturesqueness of old 
London. An introduction by the Rev. W. H. Hutton, 
B.D., tells something about the personality of Miss 
Manning, who wrote the book, and reviews briefly 
the historical facts upon which it is based. Mr. 
Hutton would have been wiser to confine himself to 
such facts, for when he launches into criticism he 
compares Milton as a religious poet, much to his 
disadvantage, with Christina Rossetti. The novel 
itself is a plausible and charming explanation of the 
vagaries of the poet's domestic life. 

Another attractive reprint is " Pomona's Travels " 
(Scribner), by Mr. Frank R. Stockton, whose name 
alone carries a laugh with it. There is humor, also, 
in the delightful pictures by Mr. A. B. Frost, which 
have almost as much character as the story. The 
cover, in buff and green, relieved with a touch of 
black, is very attractive ; and as the work itself is 
one of the happiest things that even Mr. Stockton's 
fancy has conceived, everything makes for its success. 

A popular addition of " The Adventures of Mr. 
Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.), by Mr. Cuthbert Bede, B.A., will 
appeal to collegians of the past and the future. 
There are innumerable illustrations by the author, 
badly drawn but clever and amusing nevertheless. 
They are colloquial, like the text, and very English. 

Miss Anna Fuller's " Pratt Portraits " (Putnam) 
is also given a new setting. It is characterized by 
wide margins, good paper and print, a common- 
place cover, and a series of portrait drawings by 
Mr. George Sloane, which show some cleverness and 
much appreciation of the significance of the text. 

Other reprints are two in the pretty " Thumb-Nail 
Series " (Century Co.) Cicero's " De Amicitia," 
translated by Benjamin E. Smith, and Dickens's 
"Christmas Carol," each well bound in stamped 
leather and illustrated with a good frontispiece in tint ; 
and one of an essay by Mrs. Anna Robertson Brown, 
" What is Worth While? " (Crowell), effectively 
printed in heavy black type on excellent paper. 

Music lovers and students will be interested in 
The Story of the Harp " (Lyon & Healy, Chicago), 
which gives a history of that instrument from an- 
cient times to the present, illustrated with pictures 
of the harp at the various stages of its development, 
and with half-tone portraits of famous harpists. 

Several books of selections are on the holiday 
tables, and the finest of them is emphatically the 
volume of Wordsworth edited by Mr. Andrew 
Lang (Longmans). It is neatly bound in blue 



cloth, stamped with a good design in gold ; and the 
illustrations and delicate initials by Mr. Alfred Par- 
sons are charming. The selections are from the 
shorter and more familiar of the poems, the most 
spontaneous and least didactic of the poet's work. 
The introduction emphasizes the fact that "what is 
truly great in his poetry is independent of his theory, 
and may almost be called independent of his con- 
scious reasoning self." The editor's attitude is not 
one of sympathy with his author's theories, nor even 
tolerance of them, but this does not blind him to the 
beauty of some of his work. "The Lovers' Shak- 
spere" (McClurg), compiled by Mrs. Chloe Blake- 
man Jones, is what the title indicates, a collection 
of quotations pertaining to the various phases of 
love. They are carefully selected, adroitly grouped, 
and daintily decorated. Mrs. Helen Kendrick 
Johnson has collected some " Short Sayings of 
Famous Men" and published them in two small 
volumes (Putnam). The sayings are grouped in 
a rather hap-hazard fashion under various head- 
ings. The title of one of these sections, " Wis- 
dom," is scarcely complimentary to the authors of 
selections outside of it. " The Ayrshire Homes 
and Haunts of Burns" (Putnam), by Mr. Henry 
C. Shelley, is bound in a charming thistle-deco- 
rated cover, and contains a number of interesting 
photographic illustrations. There is also the "Ian 
Maclaren Year- Book" (Dodd), with a quotation for 
each day in the year, thus giving one a fine oppor- 
tunity to duly consider and repent of any undue 
fondness for this Scotchman. " The Chatelaine " 
(Peter Paul Book Co.), by G. E. X., is a collection 
of small observations upon large topics, printed 
each upon a separate page; but even in this rivulet 
of text, words are more plentiful than ideas. One 
feels too much the struggle for an originality which 
is achieved neither in thought nor expression. 
"An Alphabet" (R. H. Russell), by Mr. William 
Nicholson, is too original and too clever to be given 
up entirely to children, much as they will enjoy it. 
It is a series of delightful character-studies, drawn 
in masses of black on light brown, with an occasional 
dash of color. The artist expresses a great deal 
with very few and very broad strokes of the brush ; 
and a grim sort of humor is everywhere evident. 

A number of calendars have been issued for the 
coming year. The " Frederic Remington Calendar" 
(Russell) is made up of a few selections, less care- 
fully printed, from a book already reviewed. "A 
Coon Calendar" (Russell) contains some of Mr. 
Kemble's clever drawings of pickaninnies, printed 
in color. The "Sports and Seasons Calendar" 
(Russell) also printed in color, illustrates golfing, 
driving, and kindred subjects, with a good deal of 
cleverness. In addition, we find a "Shakespeare 
Kalendar" (Dodd), printed on large sheets with a 
quotation for every day, "Ian Maclaren Calen- 
dar" (Dodd) for thooe who wish to be sentimental 
all the year round, and a pretty " Calendar of 
Purple Flowers" (Stokes), from designs by Paul 
de Longpre".

BOOKS FOB THE YOUNG. 

L 

The supply of children's books shows no diminution 
from year to year, and the quality of them changes but 
little. Occasionally there is an encouraging sign of 
progress in the direction of wholesomeness aiid vigor, 
but it does not conceal the many evidences of weakness, 
of snobbishness, of the worship of false gods. The fate 
of the little children who have to walk through a world 
so commonplace or so perverted is enough to excite 
sympathy. The joy of filling out the incomplete old 
nursery rhymes, of dreaming over the labyrinthine 
paths to fairyland, is never theirs. Out of these scores 
of books, barely half a dozen give the imagination a 
chance to grow. Most of them ignore the existence of 
such a quality of the mind. There is a mad search for 
facts, when impossibilities, if they have but a spark of 
humanity in them, are much more beneficial. Facts, as 
they are dressed up for children, are apt to be entirely 
false. Stories of good little school-girls and bad little 
boys who run away and join the Indians cannot make up 
for the absence of the good old fairy tales, which con- 
tain something true and genuine, something which has 
answered to the needs of generations of happy children. 
Mr. Harry Thurston Peck, in a recent essay, looks for- 
ward to a " Renaissance of the Natural, when they will 
no more be fed with formulas and made to learn so many 
improving things." We are not in need of formulas 
here in America; even brought up as we have been on 
" Jack and the Beanstalk," and the others, an excess of 
fancy is not one of our faults. So that if we are given 
only practical commonplaces to digest, the imagination 
is in danger of death from inanition. 

The Juvenile book of the year, one of the most original 
and beautiful of many years, is that in which M. Boutet 
de Monvel, in a series of colored pictures, gives his con- 
ception of the personality of " Joan of Arc " (Century 
Co.) The text is a brief and simple story of the life of 
this " humble peasant girl who is the Patroness of France, 
who is the Saint of her country as she was its Martyr." 
It is told without flourishes, which could only injure 
its exalted beauty. But the pictures are eloquent of 
the child's simplicity, her singleness of purpose, her 
self-sacrificing devotion and loyalty, and the purity of 
her exaltation. With all these qualities the artist 
shows the most exquisite and tender sympathy. From 
the first drawing, where she is merely the simple, ignor- 
ant, industrious peasant-girl, to that one where she 
stands, clear-sighted and ennobled, the accuser of her 
worldly judges, he understands her and he makes us 
understand her. The simplicity and spirituality of this 
slender little creature, as we see her in these pictures, 
are never open to question. Around her, the color and 
movement are shown with rare and wonderful art. 
Every line, every harmony of tint, is made to help in 
the expression of the emotion of the moment. The 
color reaches its climax of brilliancy in the sumptuous 
scene of the coronation, and darkens into sombreness 
as the tragedy advances. There is fine decorative 
feeling in the arrangement of line and color, and the 
characterization is admirable. It would be difficult to 
say too much in praise of these beautiful drawings, 
which the artists at the last Salon of the Champs de 
Mars were wise enough to honor with a separate room. 

For this Christmas, the department of history receives 
more than the usual attention, and the prevailing res- 
pect for facts requires that it be given due consideration. 



Such stories are among the most useful and interesting, 
though the writers too often confound fact with truth. 
The composition of a fine true story requires as much 
imagination as the writing of fiction. And in the one 
case, as in the other, the real value depends upon the 
way it is done. Nevertheless, an inferior historical tale 
is more tolerable than a weak invented one. Among 
these books, dealing more or less directly with history, 
there are some very good stories. " The Century Book 
of the American Revolution " (Century Co.), by Mr. 
Elbridge S. Brooks, adopts an ingenious method of con- 
necting the events of other days with our own life. Mr. 
Brooks carries a party of boys and girls over the ground 
made historic by the great war, telling the noble story 
of its conflicts almost entirely in dialogue. It is not an 
easy task to keep freedom and sparkle and crispness 
through such conversation between a friendly and well- 
informed uncle and several lively boys and girls. And 
Mr. Brooks succeeds in it fairly well. Occasionally the 
talk is stiff and unnatural, but he manages to give it 
variety and light-heartedness and to save the uncle from 
pedantry. The plan enables him also to tell many of the 
intimate little stories of the war, which would come in 
less naturally in a more ambitious narrative. And he 
awakens a keen interest in the places where the battles 
were fought and their character and development. It 
brings one in touch a little with the ideas and emotions 
which served to arouse a nation. The book is illustrated 
with innumerable drawings and photographs which 
greatly increase its value. It is not the only one which 
deals with the Revolution. " Washington's Young Aids " 
(W. A. Wilde & Co.), by Mr. Everett T. Tomlinson, 
centres in the New Jersey campaign. It is the story of 
two boys who render effective service as scouts and mes- 
sengers. The author tries to be accurate, but the prob- 
abilities are not always considered. It is not the brains 
of his heroes which help them out of their adventures. 
It is a tame recital of stirring events; and the author 
has so little knowledge of character that one seems to be 
looking on at a puppet-play " The Boys of Fort Schuy- 
ler " (Estes), by Mr. James Otis, is the same kind of 
tale about a different part of the same war; but the 
workmanship is much better. Here too, however, the 
situations are not always convincing, and commanders 
seem to take foolish and unnecessary risks. But there 
is some spirit in the book, and the characters are indi- 
vidualized and differentiated. The young hero carries 
important messages through the enemy's lines and issues 
triumphant from many a dangerous exploit. His is 
courage in a good cause, and will be stimulating to the 
boys of our quieter days. The pictures are mediocre, 
but the cover has originality. The same writer is res- 
ponsible for a story of Boston during the siege, which is 
called " The Signal Boys of '75 " (Estes). In this he 
has a more unusual subject, and one in which the work 
of boys seems more appropriate. It is a simple little 
story of terror and treachery contrasted with bravery 
and devotion, and the writer has told it without flourishes 
or unnecessary ornamentation. He makes one feel the 
beauty of the stanch little characters. The pictures also 
have individuality More stirring, more full of action, 
is the contribution to the story of the Revolution made 
by Mr. William O. Stoddard, one of the most interest- 
ing of the writers for boys. Its title, " The Red Patriot," 
(Appleton), indicates the important part played by an 
Indian in the thrilling drama. But the real heroes are, 
nevertheless, a boy and a horse. The one is as brave as 
the other, and together they do good service for the

great cause. Better than that, too, they are both very 
much alive; we are made to believe in them and sym- 
pathize with them. The story moves and the interest is 
skilfully maintained. A boy who carries important des- 
patches through ominous dangers, and yet abhors shoes 
and stockings, will not appeal in vain to the heart of the 
American youth. 

Mr. James Barnes carries one down to the War of 
1812, in his latest book. Its hero is " Commodore 
Bainbridge " (Appleton), and the author has had special 
opportunities of learning the facts of this commander's 
successful career. He tells the spirited story with dash 
and brilliancy, vivifying the personality of a vigorous 
and able seaman and a born commander. His is a suc- 
cess won by fearlessness, readiness, and persistence, 
a success in which character meant even more than 
ability. The story has variety, morever, and pictur- 
esqueness, for the Commodore's adventures are of many 
kinds and his ships sail in many waters. 

The War of the Rebellion is also given a share of 
attention by our historians for the young. With this 
conflict as a basis, Mr. William Henry Shelton devises 
a curious plot in " The Last Three Soldiers " (Century 
Co.). This remnant of the great army is a signal-corps 
stationed at the top of a lonely mountain. The next 
signal-station is captured by the Confederates, who send 
false messages about the defeat of the Union forces. 
Deceived by this information, the three soldiers volun- 
tarily exile themselves in their retreat, and for seven 
years they remain in ignorance of the issue of the war. 
Their life is not without incident, however, and bears 
and precipices and buried gold are conspicuous factors 
in the story. Impossible situations are given a certain 
color of probability, but the author goes far to seek his 
adventure. He has no imagination to give it life and 
charm. Mr. W. J. Henderson shows rather more of 
this quality in " The Last Cruise of the Mohawk " 
(Scribner), enough to give his seamen a little individu- 
ality. But the school-life at the beginning is most un- 
promising, and there is more than a touch of absurdity 
in the strained and obvious characterization. The vil- 
lains have a curious tendency to reform in the last 
chapter. Some of the descriptions of sea-fights with 
Farragut, however, move swiftly and excitedly. The 
same subject and period are dealt with in " Midshipman 
Jack " (W. A. Wilde & Co.), by Mr. Charles Ledyard 
Norton; and the same battle, where Admiral Farragut 
dauntlessly led his ships over the terrible torpedo line, 
forms the centre and climax of the story. It is told more 
soberly, but more clearly, than the last. There is less 
fighting in this book than in the other, and it drags 
more. 

Mr. William O. Stoddard has gone back to the begin- 
ning of the conflict with Mexico for his war-story, " The 
Lost Gold of the Montezumas" (Lippincott); and he 
could hardly find a more picturesque subject than the 
defense of the Alamo. The story has Davy Crockett 
and Colonel Bowie for its heroes, and the fall of the 
Alamo, so superbly defended, for its climax. The 
writer does not make the most of his fine opportunity; 
he does not make the siege a real, living, vital, stir- 
ring thing. But even a part of such a truth is worth 
having. 

Two other American history books antedate the Revo- 
lution. " The Young Puritans of Old Hadley " (Roberts) , 
by Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith, is an attempt to describe 
the life of Puritan children in one of the early Massa- 
chusetts settlements. The author has studied her sub- 



ject carefully, and the picture of this life, extinct yet 
still blood of our blood and bone of our bone, has un- 
usual interest. The work is well done, with many de- 
tails which increase its vividness, and it makes one rejoice 
that the difficulties and fears of the rigid little Puritans 
are not bothering the children of to-day. Mr. Hezekiah 
Butterworth's new book, "True to his Home" (Apple- 
ton), is also founded on colonial life. It relates 
to the boyhood of Franklin, and carries on the story 
of his life to the end. It is a great life, in its sim- 
plicity and sincerity as well as in its achievements, and 
it is a good thing for the American youth to know of 
it. In Mr. Butterworth's way of describing it, there is 
nothing pedantic or labored, and the moralizing is not 
too much in evidence. He has made it interesting to 
boys and girls, this story which is so much quieter and 
so much finer than that of warriors. 

Only four of these semi-historical books deal with 
other countries, which indicates the extent of patriotism 
among our youth. Two of these relate to England, one 
to Germany, and the other goes back to the fall of Carth- 
age. The Rev. Alfred J. Church writes the latter, and 
calls it " Lords of the World " (Scribner). The author's 
style is rather stiff, and the story does not move with 
the swiftness which seems necessary to the subject. Yet 
it is handled with dignity and with some ingenuity, and 
the narrative is interesting enough to overcome some 
heaviness in the method. No history is more romantic 
than that of Carthage, and one only wishes that the im- 
agination which can resurrect dead cities and peoples 
could also vivify them. The illustrations, by Ralph 
Peacock, are good. The German story is one of Mr. 
Henty's, and is called "With Frederick the Great" 
(Scribner). Mr. Henty is the one of these writers who 
best understands his world, and can handle his material 
in such a way as to keep the absorbed attention of his 
boys. His descriptions of battles have spontaneity and 
dash about them, which bring his readers into the fight- 
ing army. In this book he tries to give an impression 
of the course of the Seven Years' War, and his youthful 
hero rises, through many distinguished exploits, to the 
rank of colonel in the service of Frederick the Great. 
Another story of war (on the sea this time, and the sea 
seems to be popular this year) is " The Golden Gal- 
leon " (Scribner), by Mr. Robert Leighton. In his pre- 
face the author says that he has " tried to represent some 
of the conditions of life ashore and afloat in the glorious 
days of Queen Elizabeth." His historical basis is Lord 
Thomas Howard's expedition against the West Indian 
treasure-ships, and upon it he builds a lively and exciting 
story. Mr. Leighton has a good and spirited style, which 
does not allow the story to grow tame or the interest to 
flag. Drusilla's letter is a pretty bit of courtly writing. 
The other English book deals with " The Knights of the 
Round Table " (Scribner), a subject always attractive 
and romantic. This version is written by Mr. William 
Henry Frost, who professes himself an admirer of Ma- 
lory, and yet does not hesitate to reduce Malory's tales 
to dull prose. Any boy intelligent enough to enjoy these 
tales at all would like them infinitely better as Malory 
tells them; and the idea that such stories must be speci- 
ally written out in a b c language to suit the childish 
taste is nonsense. Children have as much feeling for 
the beauty of words as their elders; and Malory's rhyth- 
mic, sonorous phrases appeal to their imagination. Such 
sumptuous raiment is necessary to clothe these stately 
tales, and an appreciation of its appropriateness is not 
reserved for us alone. We believe too little in the in-

telligence of children, and we continue too long giving 
them food for babes. 

Those are quieter stories which Mr. W. H. Rideing 
has to offer in the new edition of "The Boyhood of 
Famous Authors " (Crowell). But it must be confessed 
that the little he has found to say about the boyhood of 
such men as Holmes, Trowbridge, Howells and Whittier 
makes rather dull reading. Aldrich and Stevenson have 
told their own stories with infinitely better effect, as Mr. 
Rideing would be the first to recognize. Stockton and 
Stedman, Boyesen and Kipling, furnish some picturesque 
material; but if their entire lives were embraced in the 
sketches, even children would find them more interesting. 

Two good examples of the happy use of the historic 
imagination in re-creating the life of a by-gone time 
are Miss Imogen Clark's " Will Shakespeare's Little 
Lad " (Scribner) and Mr. John Bennett's " Master Sky- 
lark " (Century Co.). The " little lad " of Miss Clark's 
story is of course Shakespeare's son Hamnet, twin 
brother of the Judith whose delightful picture has been 
given us by Mr. William Black in his " Judith Shakes- 
peare," one of the best historical novels ever written. 
Although this story of Hamnet is designed for younger 
readers, and the author's art is inferior to the older 
writer's, it is nevertheless a pleasant " all feigned though 
true " representation of the home life of the Arden, 
Hathaway, and Shakespeare families. Master Skylark 
of Mr. Bennett's story is a Stratford boy of the six- 
teenth century, who, falling upon hard places in London, 
seeks the aid of bis fellow-townsman, and finds him 
true to Ben Jonson's description, the " gentle Shakes- 
peare." Books of this nature are enjoyable in propor- 
tion to previous knowledge of the atmosphere and 
situation; hence the elders of the household will in 
some cases like them even more than the children, while 
the illustrations of both volumes are artistic enough to 
attract eyes of whatever age. 

Among the writers of pure fiction for children, there 
is one who has only to speak to be eagerly and affection- 
ately listened to. " Once the White-Haired Master " 
in his latest book "said to Little Crochet, They all love 
you because you are good, my son.' But Little Crotchet 
was quick to reply : Oh, no, father; it isn't that. It's 
because I am fond of them! ' " And this is also the ex- 
planation of Mr. Joel Chandler Harris's hold upon the 
children. For every living thing he has a kindness, and 
his sympathy is intuitive and exquisitely delicate. One 
feels it from the first page to the last of " Aaron in the 
Wildwoods " (Houghton), this deep understanding of 
life, and the deeper reverence for its beauty and even 
for its imperfections. In him the love of things fine 
and noble never implies harshness or cruelty to those 
creatures that are themselves harsh and cruel. Nothing 
is uninteresting to him; no character is too trivial for 
him to illuminate it. His books are too fine to be re- 
served entirely for children, yet they are never raised 
above a child's intelligence. It is only that their sim- 
plicity is subtle and their subtlety is given the color of 
simplicity. This latest book tells us the story of Aaron 
the runaway negro and Little Crochet, the cripple who 
dashes through the woods and swamps on his Gray Pony. 
We can afford to throw aside the histories for a time 
for the sake of the good honest truth and beauty which 
lie deep in the heart of such a book as this. 

In " Captains Courageous " (Century Co.), Mr. Rud- 
yard Kipling has written a fresh, breezy, bracing sort 
of story of the Grand Banks. Its hero is the spoiled and 
conceited son of a California millionaire, who in a sudden 



fit of illness falls off the deck of an ocean liner. He is 
picked up by one of the crew of the fishing schooner 
" We're Here "; and on that little boat he receives his 
first lessons in hard work and in manliness. His stories 
about his father's drags and private cars are looked upon 
as fairy tales, and for several months during the fishing 
on the banks he is one of the crew. He adjusts himself 
to the situation with boyish alacrity and a boyish love 
of novelty, and it gives him a new attitude towards life. 
It is easy to justify Mr. Kipling in his theory that such 
a revolutionary experience would be a permanently 
healthful influence in a boy's career. He fell in with good 
fellows, he worked hard, and he came into close contact 
with the elements: three things that make for righteous- 
ness. Yet the hero is his least successful character, 
much less alive than the fishermen, whose life is pre- 
sented with extraordinary vividness. The breath of 
the sea is in the book, and the men who live upon it are 
individualized sharply, but on simple lines, without in- 
tricacy or subtlety. We know them through and through, 
as we listen with a kind of amused unconcern to their 
idle talk. We lose sight at once of the author; he seems 
to be no part of his book, so completely do the characters 
act out their own story. It is a remarkable imagination 
that can so absorb itself in unfamiliar surroundings. 
Yet the story drags at times; and at the end, though the 
author is wise enough to keep the millionaire from act- 
ing as special providence when he finds his son, there is 
rather too much talk about money and the things that 
money can do. If it were not for the latter defect, 
however, we would miss the fine description of the race 
of the " lightning special " across the continent, and the 
interesting commentary upon the American man of 
affairs. This sketch indicates that Mr. Kipling should 
give us a more serious and complete picture of this type, 
that " story of the New West, whose story is yet to be 
written." There are brilliant, illuminating phrases and 
paragraphs here and there in the book, but they make 
one wish that the author would spend his time upon less 
transitory work. 

A new edition of Mr. Charles Dudley Warner's 
" Being a Boy " (Houghton) is welcome for the holi- 
days, though it is the kind of book which boys enjoy 
most after they are grown. It is half reminiscence and 
half biography, but it is wholly charming. It represents 
the life of the New England boy before the middle of 
the century, his pleasures and troubles being very much 
like those of the boy of to-day. It leaves one with the 
impression that the life of a country boy is a singularly 
happy one, in spite of the fact that he must " work for 
his independence." Mr. Warner carries one into this 
life with a delightful sympathy. He is still a boy at 
heart, and can still chuckle over his natural shortcom- 
ings and subterfuges. He good-naturedly lets one into 
the secrets of his life, but they are not very wicked 
secrets, and it might make the sternest parent more 
tolerant to read of them. This new edition after twenty 
years is illustrated with many charming realistic photo- 
graphs by Mr. Clifton Johnson, photographs that 
show the real boy, wholesome and happy, at work and 
at play. 

In " The Young Mountaineers " (Houghton), by 
Charles Egbert Craddock, there is a good deal of human 
nature. But here, too, it is of the kind that appeals to 
adults rather than to the young. The fact that " Old 
Daddy " rode three miles on a bad horse to tell his 
cronies of the great achievement of his son in seeing a 
" harnt " is delightful to us who are more or less sophisti- 



1897.] 



THE DIAL 



845 



cated, but it would have no special charm for boys. And 
the clever analysis of boy-nature in " Among the Cliffs " 
is open to the same criticism. Yet this story is so 
original and so amusing that one does not care whether 
the boys like it or not. " Way Down in Poor Valley " 
is less convincing, and its hero seems unnaturally and 
too consciously heroic. The book has caught something 
of the spirit of the mountains, though some of the de- 
scriptions are a little strident. 

Ground even more unfamiliar is covered by Mr. Hez- 
ekiah Butterworth in " Over the Andes " (Wilde). The 
author takes two boys and a girl, guided by the inevita- 
ble uncle, to Buenos Ayres, and then across country and 
over the Andes to the western coast. It is a fine oppor- 
tunity to describe a rich and beautiful region, which, to 
the American youth, is much less familiar than the 
nations of Europe. The place is a mine of romantic 
material, but Mr. Butterworth only suggests its possi- 
bilities. The beauty of the region and its poetry are 
beyond his stilted style. Yet there is much information 
that may make the boys realize that the great countries 
to the south of us are not to be ignored. And the nar- 
rative is given variety by introducing certain stories 
connected with the history and heroes of Brazil and 
Peru. 

" Paul Travers's Adventures " (Way & Williams), by 
Mr. Sam T. Clover, embrace even a larger territory. 
In his search for experience, the boy-hero of the story 
starts off on a journey around the world, determined to 
pay his way. It is a story of the kind of pluck that 
is regarded as peculiarly American, but the boy's meth- 
ods of securing money and transportation do not always 
indicate the highest sense of honor. He is a cheery, 
generous fellow, however, and his story is told crisply 
and in a vigorous style. The shipwreck, especially, is 
well done. 

There is a similar scene in " The Beach Patrol " 
(Wilde), by Mr. William Drysdale, but it is written 
from the point of view of a boy in the life-saving ser- 
vice instead of one on the wreck. The rescue of the 
passengers makes an exciting narrative, and gives one 
an insight into the dangers of the service and the dar- 
ing required to meet them. The story has a dash and 
swing that will hold the attention of all boys who love 
courage. 

One is not encouraged to read a book for its style on 
learning in the opening sentence that " one of the most 
wonderful landscapes of the world was outspread in 
every direction." Nevertheless, a description of " The 
Painted Desert " (Harper) is no easy thing to write, 
and when Mr. Kirk Munroe gets beyond this and fairly 
into his story, his style improves. Todd Chalmers, his 
hero, accompanies a scientific expedition into Arizona, 
and in the course of a deer-hunt loses his companions 
and finds himself alone in the Painted Desert. His en- 
counter there with some Quaker hermits, and their 
subsequent exposure of two swindlers who attempt to 
" salt " the valley with diamonds, form the basis of a vig- 
orous and interesting story. The background, which is 
always kept in evidence, has a charm of its own; and 
Mr. Lungren's admirable drawings make it vivid where 
Mr. Munroe's descriptions do not. We have a glimpse, 
though, of curious Indian customs, like the snake-dance. 
The work is cleverly constructed, and the author is 
ingenious in devising original and striking situations. 

Life in the far west attracts the authors of two other 
books. " The Big-Horn Treasure " (McClurg), by Cap- 
tain John F. Cargill, goes to the Rocky Mountains for 



a story of mining. In this, the hero (and it is curious 
that heroes always should be born fortunate) discovers, 
through the chance of an accidental fall, a rich vein of 
gold. Like all heroes, he at once appreciates the value 
of his discovery, and knows how to make the most of it 
and defend it from his enemies. He ultimately secures 
his millions, travels around the world, and lives happily 
ever after. The constant, complete, and overwhelming 
success of heroes becomes, however, a somewhat painful 
mystery after one has read a score or more of children's 
books. One begins to long for an unlucky and improvi- 
dent hero, and to understand why boys should take to 
smoke and girls to tempers in order to escape the deadly 
monotony. 

It is rather a relief to come upon the quieter adven- 
tures of "The King of the Park" (Crowell), by Mr. 
Marshall Saunders. The action takes place in civilized 
Boston, and " King Boozy " is a cat. The conspicuous 
place in the story, however, is occupied by a French 
boy, who is an interesting little aristocrat. The study 
of his character is neither consistent nor profound, but 
it is effective nevertheless, and it has some originality. 
Democratic ideas are developed in his obstinate little 
head at last, but his French notions produce some curi- 
ous situations. And the scene in which he demands the 
hand of a playmate from her father is amusing even if 
it is false. 

There is a suggestion of Little Lord Fauntleroy about 
the book just named, as there is also in " A Little House 
in Pimlico" (McClurg), by Miss Marguerite Bon vet. 
But in spite of this, the latter is an attractive little story, 
very daintily written. The characters are exaggerated, 
sentimentalized a little; the mother and son are almost 
too good and gentle, and the uncle is much too crotch- 
etty. But there is a certain delicate grace in the man- 
ner of telling the simple story, which has its charm. 
The leading character of the book is Beckie the maid, 
who has a good deal of individuality. The pictures, by 
Miss Helen Maitland Armstrong, are excellent. 

The hero of "The Wreck of the Circus" (Crowell), 
by Mr. James Otis, is not a model of goodness, but he 
is heavily punished for his faults. His parents, how- 
ever, are not punished at all for their inconsiderate 
cruelty in ordering a healthy boy to stay at home and 
take care of the baby on the one day when the circus 
is in possession of the town. His revolt is as natural 
as the terror which assails him when he thinks the baby 
crushed under the fallen tent. The narrative is well 
bandied, and has a wholesome moral for boys and for the 
mothers of boys. 

Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champney has written a delightful 
little French story in " Pierre and his Poodle " ( Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). Its heroes are two French poodles, one 
of whom is an aristocrat and the other the property of 
a travelling show-wagon. But love levels all ranks, 
and the two join forces and pass through many interest- 
ing adventures together. Incidentally the life of the 
travelling showman is depicted, with many a French 
custom, strange to us. There is an exciting scene where 
Pierre rescues Popotte as they are about to feed her to 
the serpent, and is himself almost killed in the effort. 
Mrs. Cbampney has written many children's stories, 
but none so good as this. She has given individuality 
and charm to her characters, including her dogs. The 
pictures, by Mr. F. D. Steele, are as clever as the 
story. 

"Derick" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), by Miss Barbara 
Yechton, is a pretty story, rather too pretty. It con- 



846

[Dec. 1, 



tains a good deal of superfluous talk about dress, and the 
city life it describes is not particularly bracing. But 
Derick's purchase of a silver butter-dish surmounted by 
a resplendent cow, and his presentation of it to his rich 
friend, is a clever bit of description. 

It would require a self-sacrificing boy to withstand 
so alluring a title-page as that of " The Rover's Quest " 
(Lippincott), by Mr. Hugh St. Leger. It is described 
as " a story of foam, fire, and fight," and the author 
does his best to live up to this thrilling characteriza- 
tion. 

A new edition of two of the perennial Hollo books, 
Rollo at Work " and " Hollo at Play " (Crowell), is 
published, after forty years since their first appearance, 
and they are supplied with a preface in which parents 
are informed that the books will do good service in 
"cultivating the thinking powers, in promoting the 
progress of children, and in cultivating the amiable and 
gentle qualities of the heart." With such advantages 
it would be a stony-hearted parent who could resist 
the inclination to put these favorites of his own youth 
into the hands of his boys and girls. 

A new translation of " Cuore," by Edmondo de Ami- 
cis, is published under the title of " The Heart of a 
Boy" (Laird & Lee). The translation is the work of 
Prof. G. Mantellini, and is well done in spite of occa- 
sional roughnesses. The book deserves to be as well 
known in America as in Italy, for there is nothing 
special or exceptional in its application. It goes to the 
root of things, touching the fundamental emotions of 
youth. And though it is a quiet story of school-life, it 
has an absorbing interest, and is in many ways one of 
the best books that have ever been written for boys. 

Three new volumes in the " Bound to Win " series 
(W. L. Allison Co.) tell of different kinds of adven- 
ture. In " Poor but Plucky," by Arthur M. Winfield, 
the hero finds his enemies in floods and robbers and 
conspirators. But he lives up to the title with remark- 
able and rather amusing consistency The same author's 
" Schooldays of Fred Harley " is occupied with games 
rather than with books, baseball being especially prom- 
inent. The nature of the adventures and the way they 
are described are rather different from the fine serenity 
of de Amicis' school-life. Hunting is the special fea- 
ture of " Gun and Sled," by Captain Ralph Bonehill, 
and it enables him to tell many a hair-raising story of 
fights with wild-cats and wolves, which even a boy could 
hardly take very seriously. 

Two stories by " Oliver Optic " are contributed to 
the holiday pleasures of boys. "At the Front" (Lee 
& Shepard) is the fifth of the land series of " The Blue 
and the Gray," the battle of Stone River being its cen- 
tre and climax " Pacific Shores " is the last volume 
of the "All-over- the- World Library " (Lee & Shepard). 
The voyage includes Japan, Australia, New Zealand, 
and the Fiji Islands, and brings the boy traveller home 
a "model hero." 

The Rev. Louis Albert Banks in his "An Oregon 
Boyhood " (Lee & Shepard), tells a story of western 
pioneering. He does it rather heavily, but his book 
contains much interesting information regarding the 
life of the adventurous men who first crossed the conti- 
nent The same publishers reprint in the small books 
of the " Hearthstone series " three good stories for 
boys, "The Man who Stole a Meeting- House," by 
J. T. Trowbridge; "Getting an Indorser," by Oliver 
Optic; and "Exiled from Two Lands," by E. T. Tom- 
linson.

The period of "Let Us Follow Him" is that of the death of Christ, and it was this story

FROM THE AUTHOR TO MR. CURTIN. 

I have read with diligent attention all the volumes of my works sent me (American edition). I under- 
stand how great the difficulties were which you had to overcome, especially in translating the historical 
novels, the language of which is somewhat archaic in character. 

I admire not only the sincere conscientiousness and accuracy, but also the skill, with which you did 
the work. Your countrymen will establish your merit better than I as to me, I can only desire that 
you and no one else should translate all that I write. 

With respect and friendship, HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ.

" Let DIARIES be Brought into Use," 

SAID THE WISE LORD BACON 300 YEARS AGO. 

The regular systematic use of a Diary economizes time, 
teaches method, and in the use of its Cash Account saves 
money. Even the briefest notes made in a Diary are easily 
referred to, and give a reliable and chronological history of 
one's acts, while if entered in a memorandum book they are 
soon lost.

A New Book by Mrs. Latimer. 

Spain in the Nineteenth Century. 

By ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER. With many por- 
traits. 8vo. $2.50. 

Those who have read Mrs. Latimer's former histories 
of the 19th century, as they have successively appeared 
during the past six years, will welcome this latest (and 
probably the last) of the series. It can confidently be 
stated that the author has achieved a distinct success in 
her new book, which gives information about the recent 
history of Spain that cannot be found in any other one 
volume now accessible. The history is brought down 
to the present day, and a chapter is devoted to the 
Spanish Colonies, and a chapter to Cuba.

Two Important New Books by Dr. Barrows. 

Christianity, the WorId=Religion. 

By the Rev. JOHN HKNRY BARROWS. 8vo. $1.50. 

Dr. Barrows, the President of the Parliament of Religions 
during the World's Fair, was appointed to deliver in India 
and Japan a series of seven lectures on Christianity. This 
was the initial of a course of lectures, established by the be- 
quest of Mrs. Caroline E Haskell, and to be conducted under 
the auspices of the University of Chicago. Dr. Barrows de- 
livered these in l!S9f>-7, and the present .volume is the full 
text, with notes, of those lectures. 

The Indian Witness, of Calcutta, said: "We very much 
doubt whether India has ever been favored with so worthy a 
presentation of the Christian faith. . . . The lectures are a 
magnificent contribution to the Christian Evidences, well 
worthy of a permanent place in literature." 

A World=Pilgrimage. 

By the Rev. JOHN HENRY BARROWS. Illustrated. 
8vo. $2.00. 

In this book Dr. Barrows describes the main incidents and 
observations of his recent journey around the globe. In these 
pages pass before us eminent men of many faiths, patriarchs, 
high-priests, pundits, noted divines, statesmen, literary mag- 
nates and maharajahs. The scenes of nature both in Europe 
and Asia, university life in Germany, the brilliant society in 
Paris, the art of Italy and Greece, the present unrest in the 
Ottoman Empire, the ancient life of Egypt, the restless, suffer- 
ing life of India, and the strange and varied life of the Far East ; 
all these things are touched upon, or elaborately described.

A HINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS. 



FOR THE PRESENT HOLIDAY SEASON, Book-lovers have the chance to 
procure for gift purposes such a literary treasure as was never before seen. To Mr. Charles 
Dudley Warner, as its editor-in-chief, belongs the palm of victory for this achievement in book 
production. The " Library of the World's Best Literature," as it has been happily named, 
might also fitly be termed the world's crowning effort in the creation of books. 

Either praise or minute description of this magnificent work would seem almost needless 
to a public that has read its eulogy, since the appearance of the very first volume, in all the 
chief literary periodicals of the country. Just here may be noted briefly the principal features 
that constitute the Library a work of surpassing excellence for profit and enjoyment : 

CRITICAL ESSAYS. About a thousand graphic essays, by living scholars and 
writers of eminence, furnish in popular style their critical, interpretative, biographical, and 
historical comments on the world's great authors and their principal works, alike of ancient and 
modern times. In every one of these the critic is also a specialist in relation to his subject. 

SELECTED LITERATURE. Following the interpretative studies are presented 
the master productions of the most famous writers of all ages and countries. The collection 
includes Poetry, History, Romance, Oratory, Biography, Science and Philosophy, Theology, 
Letters, Drama, Wit and Humor, and every other form of literary expression. 

HISTORY OF LITERATURE. The Library contains histories of all the world's 
literatures, ancient and modern, written in each case by a specialist who is recognized as author- 
ity on the subject. The sacred books of the nations also form special studies. 

SYNOPSIS OF BEST BOOKS. Three thousand of the world's best books are 
separately analyzed and given in clear synopsis of narrative, plot, and characters. Refreshes 
our past reading and guides to that of the future. 

BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY. The most complete and accurate dictionary of 
the lives of great authors ever made. It embraces 12,000 names and gives under each all 
essential facts and literary successes. 

INDEX. The most elaborate and careful ever yet compiled for a work of magnitude. 
It indexes by reference and cross-reference every name, event, book, selection, topic and senti- 
ment treated of on any page of the Library. An immense boon to literary workers. Such 
are the chief features that distinguish the "Library of the World's Best Literature." But 
they are not all. There are others that serve to make it as helpful to the student and scholar 
as it is bright and entertaining for mere intellectual recreation. 



Not for those of next year or the years to follow, can the LIBRARY be obtained at the excep- 
tionally low price now made available through the Harper's Weekly Club. This was only 
established as an introductory figure to enable the public to learn the merits and value of the 
work. THE PRICE is TO BE ADVANCED AFTER NEW YEAR'S DAT. None should miss the 
present opportunity to secure full particulars under the exceptionally advantageous offer made 
for the month of December to all who become members of the Harper's Weekly Club.

CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS 

HAVE NOW READY: 

AUDUBON AND HIS JOURNALS. By Maria R. Audubon. 

With Notes by ELLIOTT COUES. With many portraits and other illustrations. Two volumes, 8vo, $7.50. 
CONTENTS: Biography The European Journals, 1826-29 The Labrador Journal, 1833 The Missouri 
Journals, 1843 The Episodes. 

In these volumes appears for the first time not only an adequate and correct biography of Audubon, but the full text of his famous 
" Journals " and " Episodes." Now we have " the living man in place of the death-mask " which has for thirty years passed as a true repre- 
sentation. The entire publication is virtually new. The Missouri Journals are almost wholly new ; the Labrador and European ones largely 
so, and the Episodes never before collectively printed in English. For the benefit of the scientific readers Dr. Elliott Coues has supplied 
abundant zoological notes, but the work is really one which appeals in the widest manner to the general public. Among the many illustrations 
are three fine examples of bird drawings by Audubon never before published, and there are also ten portraits of him. 

THE DECORATION OF HOUSES. 

By EDITH WHABTON and ODGEN CODMAN, Jr. With 56 full-page illustrations. Small 4to, $4.00. 
There are few subjects the literature of which is more deficient than is the case with house decoration, and the present volume will appeal 
to all who are confronted by the many problems that arise in the arrangement and decoration of the home. The suggestive descriptions are 
reinforced by a series of photographic illustrations showing what good taste and ingenuity have already devised for various conditions. 

MRS. BURNETT'S GREAT STORIES 

THE WOMAN'S SIDE. 

A LADY OF QUALITY. 

By FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT. 12mo, $1.50. 

THIRTIETH THOUSAND. 

"The plot is excellent, and an unflagging interest is maintained 
from the first page to the very last. The character of Clorinda the 
wild artful child, the beautiful Mistress Wildairs, the comparatively 
excellent Countess of Dunstanwolde, the superlatively noble Duchess 
of Osmonde is drawn with great originality and wonderful vigor." 
The Critic. 

LULLABY LAND. Songs of Childhood. By Eugene Field. 

Selected and with an Introduction by KENNETH GRAHAMS. With about two hundred illustrations by CHARLES ROBINSON. 

12mo, $1.50. 

'* Mr. Charles Robinson is a draughtsman who seems to have been born to make drawings of babies and children. He illustrated to 
perfection Stevenson's book, " A Child's Garden of Verses," and now the Scribners publish a selection from Eugene Field's poems, made 
by Kenneth Grahame and illustrated by Mr. Robinson, which is wholly irresistible. 'Lullaby Land : Songs of Childhood,' as the book is 
called, is packed with droll ideas expressed in engaging form. Field was at his best in such rhymes. Mr. Grahame's tribute is that of a man 
peculiarly qualified to speak on the subject, and to him and Mr. Robinson we owe a debt of gratitude. It is a songbook to be put beside the 
Stevenson collection and there regarded with affection." New York Tribune. 



THE MAN'S SIDE. 

HIS GRACE OF OSMONDE. 

By FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT. 12mo, $1.50. 
Just Published. 

TWENTIETH THOUSAND. 

" Not many writers live who could have drawn this man so finely 
and made him so real. His character alone gives the book a valid 
excuse for existence, but the story is so interesting and so artistically 
written that even the readers of ' A Lady of Quality ' will be held to 
the end." Botton Herald. 



SOCIAL LIFE IN OLD VIRGINIA. 

By THOMAS NELSON PAGE. With illustrations by the 

Misses COWLES. 12mo, $1.50. 

A vivid picture, in Mr. Paige's usual fascinating style, of the con- 
ditions and manners that existed among the ante-bellum gentlefolk of 
Virginia, which is admirably supplemented by the illustrations, imag- 
inative and realistic. The latter form a very unusually artistic and 
striking series, and help one greatly in obtaining an idea of the people 
and things described. 

GLORIA VICTIS. 

By J. A. MITCHELL, Editor of Life. 12mo, 81.25. 
A new book by the author of the popular " Amos Judd," now in its 
seventh edition. It represents his most important literary work thus 
far and presents more sharply etched views of certain aspects of New 
York life than have ever before appeared. 



THIS COUNTRY OF OURS. 

By BENJAMIN HARRISON, ex-President of the United States. 

12mo, $1.50. 

" The most lucid and entertaining exposition yet put in print of a 
subject of which we will venture the opinion three-fourths of the peo- 
ple in this country have only an indefinite understanding." PAi/o- 
delphia Evening Bulletin. 

OLD CREOLE DAYS. 

By GEORGE W. CABLE. With 8 full-page illustrations and 
14 head and tail pieces by ALBERT HERTER, all repro- 
duced in photogravure, and with an original cover design 
by the same artist. 8vo, $6.00. 
" A gift book for the holidays, in which a piece of real literature is 

really illustrated in a manner that leaves nothing to be desired. "

THE GREAT LITERARY SENSATION OF THE 

"QUO VADIS" 

By HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ. 

AUTHORIZED UNABRIDGED COPYRIGHT TRANSLATION BY JEREMIAH CURTIN. 

IN VARIOUS EDITIONS. 

AN ILLUSTRATED HOLIDAY EDITION, with pictures by HOWARD PYLE, EVERT VAN MUYDEN, 
and EDMUND H. GARRETT. Two volumes. 8vo. Cloth, gilt, in box. JUST READY. 

FROM THE AUTHOR TO MR. CURTIN. 

I have read with diligent attention all the volumes of my work sent me (American edition). I understand how 
great the difficulties were which you had to overcome, especially in translating the historical works, the language of 
which is somewhat archaic in character. 

I admire not only the sincere conscientiousness and accuracy, but also the skill, with which you did the work. Your 
countrymen will establish your merit better than I. As to me, I can only desire that you, and no one else, should trans- 
late all that I write. With respect and friendship, HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ. 



MANIA 



Translated from the Polish of HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ by JEREMIAH CURTIN. With portrait of the author 

and his daughter. Crown 8vo. Cloth, $2.00. 

The new volume by the author of " Quo Vadis " comprises over 550 pages, about one-third being occupied by 
the story which gives the book its title, " Hania." It is a romance of strength and tenderness and powerful char- 
acterization, its scene being laid in Poland. In addition to " Hania," the volume includes the author's latest 
story "On the Bright Shore," a romance of Monte Carlo; a philosophical religious story of the crucifixion, en- 
titled " Let Us Follow Him," which suggested to Sienkiewicz the idea of writing " Quo Vadis "; a sketch entitled 
"Tartar Captivity"; the germ of " With Fire and Sword," and the other volumes of the great trilogy; a humor- 
ous novelette, entitled " That Third Woman," etc.

COPELAND AND DAY 



FREE TO SERVE 



A tale of Colonial New York. By E. RA.YNER. Cloth, octavo, $1.50. 

CLINTON ROSS says : " The proof of a long book is in the reading of it. . . . The author, an artist, never once obtrudes 
her personality. . . . The life of the actors is cleverly real. It 's a notable book, so much better than Hugh Wynne that, if 
the publisher's claim of that book be true, this novel is greater. It is certainly one of the American novels of the year. Dutch 
America has had no better presentation than E. RAYNER'S in FREE TO SERVE." 

MRS. LOUISE CHANDLER MOULTON says : " It is a great book, and one of the few great books of 1897. It combines 
a most thrilling story with the most consistent, admirable character drawing, a combination one seems seldom to find in 
these days." 

" ' Free to Serve ' is fully as interesting and as well written as Dr. Mitchell's ' Hugh Wynne.' " Rochester Post Express, 

THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT says : " The book is not the work of a novice ; it is fascinating, strong, and of the highest 
moral tone. . . . The characters are finely delineated, the varied and rapidly shifting scenes are pictured with the skill of an 
artist, and the pure moral tone is carried through the whole like a golden thread. We advise all to read the book." 

" It does for the life and fashions of old New York what Weir Mitchell's ' Hugh Wynne ' did for Philadelphia. . . . There 
is plenty of action in the transitions from chapter to chapter, some strongly drawn character-etching and an intense vein of 
human interest. Few will pick up the tale without feeling the charm of its style and the subtle fascination of its subject 
matter." Philadelphia Call. 

" The book is praiseworthy for its wholesome interest." Buffalo Express. 

" Here is a work that can but leave a strong impression upon any into whose hands it shall come." Boston Courier. 

" One of the very best stories of the colonial period yet written." Philadelphia Bulletin. 

HARVARD EPISODES 

By CHARLES MACOMB FLANDRAU, '95. Cloth, octavo, $1.25. Second Edition in Press. 

In this book Mr. Flandrau has departed widely from the usual college story. He has, in a series of short, vivid sketches, 
drawn the modern " Harvard Man " as he is, not as he has been or as he ought to be, but truthfully as he is. The book does 
not, naturally, detail all sides of the present complex Harvard life ; but for the side which it does treat, the typical prosper- 
ous, happy side, it does the best thing tells the truth, and tells it in a most delightful fashion. We feel sure that so accurate 
a picture of modern college life has not yet been drawn, and that all college men will appreciate this and heartily welcome 
the book.

THE FRENCH COURT AND SOCIETY. REIGN OF Louis XVI. AND FIRST EMPIRE. 2 vols. 
THE COURT OF TUILERIES, FROM THE RESTORATION TO THE FLIGHT OF Louis PHILIPPE. 2 vols. 

The titles of this celebrated series indicate the scope of Lady Jackson's writings, which touch on different periods of 
French history from the time of Catherine de Medici to that of Louis Philippe, and deal with the manners and customs of the 
times, with chatty personal gossip taken from the memoirs of the brilliant men and women who flourished in this famous 
court. The writer has done her work most carefully, and is at all times historically accurate. 

A new font of type has been used in setting the volumes, and the utmost care has been given to the presswork. 
The size of page and size of volume (crown octavo) have been decided upon after careful comparison with the best 
models, and it has been the aim of the publishers to make, as nearly as possible, an ideal set of books. An English paper, 
smooth, without gloss, soft and flexible, and pure in color, made at Dickinson's Croxley Mills, has been selected. 

Each volume is illustrated with eight photogravures or etchings, careful reproductions of celebrated engraved portraits, 
printed with the plate mark ; and is bound with gilt tops and uncut edges, in new English silk- ribbed cloth, with a striking 
original die stamped in gold on side and back.

A GARDEN OF 
ROMANCE. 

Edited by 

ERNEST RHYS. 

Price, $2.00. 



This superb volume was made especially for us in England and is beautifully printed (by 
Ballantine ) , daintily bound in large foolscap quarto, white cloth, gold pattern, and is boxed. 
It contains a collection of the best romantic short stories of all time. 

NOTE WHAT THE Two GREATEST ENGLISH REVIEWS SAY OF THEM : 

The Athenaeum : " No one can read these masterpieces without feeling glad to have them in their present 
form of good pi int, wide margins, and pretty binding. . . . All such books are landmarks in literary history." 

The Speaker (London) : " Imagination and fancy have their perfect work in these pages and in reading 
them we feel ourselves to be with the immortals." 



OPALS FROM 

A MEXICAN 

MINE. 

By GEORGE DEVALLIERE 
Price, $1.25. 



This richly bound volume contains a number of tales of Mexican life so beautiful as to be 
welcomed with enthusiasm by every critic of repute who has read them. 

NOTE THESE SPECIMEN REVIEWS FROM THE BEST PAPERS. 

The Boston Times: "Are indeed literary gems. . . . We are glad to have found these Mexican opals; 
they are to us gems of value and we thank the author." 

The Bookman (New York) : " Now and then a tale flames like a field of poppies in windless sunshine." 

The Critic (New York) :" The like hardly happens twice in a decade. . . . Are unmistakably interesting. " 



THE LURE 
FAME. 

By 



OF 



CLIVE HOLLAND. 
Price, $1.00. 



Every reader of The Dial is familiar with Clive Holland's "My Japanese Wife," which 
had such a wonderful success when published by the Macmillan Company two years ago. This 
volume is a worthy successor, is large square llimo in size, contains a drawing and decoration 
by George Wharton Edwards, and is handsomely bound. 

NOTE WHAT CHARLES DEXTEK ALLEN SAYS OF IT IN "THE HARTFORD POST." 

" Before one gets to the story itself he must stop and admire the handsome setting the book has received. 
... Its title will suggest something of the thread of the story, but one is not thereby prepared for so tender 
and sympathetic a picture as those pages reveal, or so close an analysis of human feelings and experiences." 



Don't miss this opportunity of getting a beautiful Christmas gift at a reasonable figure. You take 
no chances. The authorities we quote show you the value of what you are getting.

a meteor in the Northern world. Into the framework of this historical

THE ACADEMY GAME. 

When subjects of a timely or sensational 
nature fail him, the resourceful literary editor 
always has the satisfaction of knowing that he 
can fall back upon a discussion of some such 
well-worn subject as the ten greatest poems, or 
the hundred best books, or the forty living 
writers most deserving of academic immortality. 
These diversions characterize the " silly season " 
of literary journalism, and always provide both 
amusement and edification to the philosophical 
student of critical opinion. The last of the 
subjects above mentioned is the one just now 
upon the tapis, and the ball of discussion has 
been set rolling, with a fair amount of impetus, 
by our English contemporary, "The Academy," 
in a praiseworthy effort to live up to the obli- 
gations of its name. 

The thing is done in the old familiar way. 
A list of forty names is printed, and the public 
is invited to take a hand in the melee, while 
participation is further stimulated by the per- 
sonal appeal of the editor to as many well- 
known writers as he thinks are likely to fall

posed upon anyone except Mr. Swinburne, who 
comments upon the plan with his customary 
suavity. " The notion of an English academy 
is too seriously stupid for a farce, and too es- 
sentially vulgar for a comedy," he remarks, 
and adds: "It seems to me that the full and 
proper definition of so preposterous an imper- 
tinence must be left to others than the bearer 
of a name selected for the adulation of such an 
insult." Mr. Swinburne always gets excited 
about things that he doesn't like, and his sense 
of humor, elsewhere so richly displayed, deserts 
him upon such occasions. Most of the con- 
tributors to the "Academy" symposium, how- 
ever, write in a vein of good humor, and their 
opinions, although couched in sober terms, are 
mostly suggestive of a suppressed chuckle. It 
is only a game, after all, and the object of 
games is to provide entertainment for those 
who participate in them. We cannot resist 
the temptation to take a hand ourselves, and 
trust that our observations, however serious they 
may seem, will not be taken as expressing the 
opinion that an English academy, thus created 
de novo, is either desirable or even possible. 

The list presented is not a bad one, as such 
lists go, and the names are all of people whose 
intellectual standing is such as to justify their 
consideration all, that is, except the Rev. 
Aidan Gasquet, of whose achievements we are 
bound to confess entire ignorance. " Who is 
the Rev. Aidan Gasquet?" asks Mr. H. G. 
Wells, and we cannot refrain from adding 



his other question : " Why does the Duke of 
Argyll always figure in this sort of thing?" It 
is a little puzzling to find Mr. Henry James in 
this galley, and if his name be not promptly 
withdrawn we shall insist upon making Mr. 
Rudyard Kipling a member of the American 
academy as soon as we get around to the organ- 
ization of that equally-to-be-desired body. A 
fair exchange is no robbery. And it is surely 
unkind to ask, as one correspondent does, " If 
you admit an American (in the person of Mr. 
Henry James), why not admit Captain Mahan, 
and so exhaust American literature ? " Ex- 
haust, indeed ! Such sayings do not further 
the great cause of international amenity. Have 
we not recently produced a " Library of the 
World's Best Literature " in which, upon our 
own showing, there may be found American 
immortals to the number of several times the 
beggarly forty of our English contemporary ? 
A few of the comments made upon the 
" Academy " list are too interesting to be 
missed. Sir Herbert Maxwell writes: "I have 
no confidence whatever in Mr. W. E. Glad- 
stone's literary judgment; he is omnivorous, 
and writes as enthusiastically about 'The Chris- 
tian' as about 'The Odyssey.' Greatly as I 
admire his faculties in his own sphere, he is no 
more than a peregrine in literature." The same 
writer futher remarks : " I am sorry that I can- 
not restrain a shudder at the prospect of Mr. 
Meredith having a hand in moulding style." 
Perhaps the boldest of the correspondents is the 
one who carps at the two women on the list ; but 
his misogyny is counterbalanced by the other 
writer who sends a list of forty women proposed 
for a parallel academy of the downtrodden sex. 
Some names included in the " Academy " 
forty are certainly astonishing, when we consider 
the names that do not appear. Here are a score 
of candidates for the " forty-first armchair." 

James Martineau. Henry Sidgwick. 

Sir Frederick Pollock. Robert Bridges. 

Lord Acton. Professor Mahaffy. 

Theodore Watts-Dunton. J. H. Shorthouse. 

Professor Dowden. 



Edward Caird. 
William Watson. 
Stopford Brooke. 
Lloyd Morgan. 
Professor Tyrrell. 
A. J. Balfour. 



Sir Walter Besant. 
Goldwin Smith.

Frederick Harrison. 
Augustus Jessopp. 

A list that leaves out the best of these, and yet 
finds places for Mr. J. M. Barrie, Mr. W. S. 
Gilbert, Mr. William Archer, and Mr. W. B. 
Yeats, is certainly not a list controlled by the 
sort of critical judgment that commands re- 
spect. Take Mr. Watts-Dunton, for example,

undoubtedly the first of living critics, and per- 
haps the first of all English critics. No one

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE. 

LONDON, Dec. 5, 1897. 

The rush and stress of the publishing season of 1897 
is over, and publishers as well as authors are breathing 
a space, or speculating as to how the public will receive 
the many things, good and bad, which have been pre- 
pared for it. Meanwhile, all the work falls on the 
shoulders of the hard-worked and ill-paid bookseller, 
who is just now groaning that he can't make a " living 
wage." Much has been argued, more written, and more 
will be written, on this everlasting question the rela- 
tions of the publisher, bookseller, and author; but of 
this, another time. 

Without a doubt, the success of the season has been 
Lord Tennyson's " Life " of his father. On all sides, 
from high and low, from great and small, the work has 
been accorded a welcome quite unique in the annals of 
the past ten years of literature. Tbat it would receive 
a cordial greeting was expected, for the " Life " of 
Alfred Tennyson suggested much that was interesting; 



but what was not anticipated was the unstinted praise 
it has obtained as a piece of literary biography. Apart 
from the subject matter of the two volumes, it seems 
that we must accept the " Life of Tennyson " as among 
the few great biographies in our language; otherwise, 
the critics must be wrong. Of course, that critics should 
err, cannot for a moment be granted; since the mark of 
the modern critic is his capacity for anticipating the 
verdict of posterity. Fortunately, however, for this 
" Life," it has not been appraised by the " common or 
garden " critic; so that we may take the opinion passed 
as the outcome of judicious thinking and scholarly ap- 
preciation. At any rate, it has sold remarkably well ; so 
well, indeed, that the English publisher who said, "the 
selling power of a book is in inverse ratio to its intrinsic 
value," must surely now remodel bis law. 

Our English critics have, for some time now, been 
having a bad time of it. It all began with Marie Corelli, 
when she stopped sending them her novels for review, 
and so deprived them of a legitimate source of income. 
In all probability, we shall now hear of another lady 
novelist emulating Miss Corelli in this respect. The 
reviewer of Mrs. Sarah Grand's "The Beth Book," in 
the London " Daily Telegraph," had occasion, after 
praising the first part of that good dame's story, to 
animadvert on the "sexuality " of the second part. The 
animadversion has evidently touched Mrs. Grand, for 
she writes the following letter to the " Telegraph." I 
give it in extenso, as illustrating how to write "in the 
grand manner." The lady writes from the Pyrenees. 

" SIR. My distance from home makes the receipt of papers 
a somewhat fitful event, and this must be my excuse for the 
delay in answering your delicate apostrophe to me. That you 
should insult Scott and Thackeray and Dickens with your 
approval p-tins me but little, since they will never hear of it ; 
that you are so much cleverer than I am I must modestly 
accept your word for ; that you strain yourself to be facetious 
and but prove yourself a dnnce, I must attribute to your acad- 
emic degree, and a course of the blighting wit of the common- 
room ; that yon should attack me with base misrepresentation, 
I set down to some rag of chivalry that still clings to you ; that 
you are of ancient lineage I am willing to admit, since your 
putting into my mouth words and sentiments which are not 
mine shows you infected with the blood of Ananias ; that you 
should take yourself as a serious judge of art is a crime for 
which it is painful to think you must one day settle between 
yon and your God ; but that you should write yourself down 
an admirer of mine is the ugliest blow that my art has dealt 
me, and I take this opportunity to publicly apologise for it. 
Believe me, yours in sorrow for your insincerity, 

SARAH GRAND." 

All this does not mean that the lady is angry ; quite the 
contrary. She is just her sweetly angelical self, even 
as one of her heavenly twins would be. Let the 
" Academy " note, and fail not to give its 100 reward 
to the fortunate and discriminating judge who shall 
choose Mrs. Sarah Grand as one whom a possible 
" Academy " would delight to honor. Well may 
' Punch " make her say, " I have written the beth 
book in the world; I know no better." 

Our new great " literary weekly " is progressing 
apace. From all that one hears, and by all that one 
may judge, " Literature " is likely to become an im- 
portant influence in the development of those conditions 
which make literature possible. Its reviews and articles 
are distinguished by original thought and scholarly 
treatment. We are hoping, sincerely, that it may never 
descend to academic " dryasdustery," and that it will 
give us just a little more for our money. 

With the new year, the Kelmscott Press will cease

to exist. Its last publication is to be a " Note," by the 
late Mr. William Morris, on his aims in starting the 
Press. The type is to remain in the hands of the trus- 
tees " for future use," but the " special ornament will 
be discontinued, and the wood-blocks deposited in the 
British Museum." This is as it should be. However 
excellently well intentioned the trustees and their help- 
ers may have been, it must, long ago, have been made 
evident to them that the Press without Mr. Morris 
was, after all, not the same thing as the Press with Mr. 
Morris. Some day, this will be better appreciated, when 
we find collectors confining their purchases to those books 
only which had the benefit of the supervision and orna- 
mentation of the printer himself. 

Much is in the air as to future publications. The novel- 
ists are always busy, and we are to have, next year, 
stories by Mr. Conan Doyle, Mr. Henry Seton Merri- 
man, Mr. Stanley Weyman, Mr. Anthony Hope, Mr. 
Crockett, and Mr. Grant Allen, in addition to a shoal 
from the smaller fry. Mr. Doyle's book will be issued 
in February, and is the story which ran as a serial in 
the " Strand Magazine." Its title is to be " The Tragedy 
of the Korosko." I believe it will be issued, in America, 
by the J. 6. Lippincott Co. Mr. Merrimau's tale has 
to run a preliminary serial course in the " Cornhill," 
with the title, "Roden's Corner"; while Mr. Weyman's 
" Shrewsbury " is already being passed through the press 
by the house of Longmans. Mr. Grant Allen's story is 
to be called " The Incidental Bishop," and Mr. Crockett's 
" The Standard Bearer." This last is half way towards 
completion in the columns of a popular religious " week- 
ly." Mr. Hope's book has, as yet, no title, and it will 
not be ready before next autumn. Publications in other 
departments of literature must wait further develop- 
ments. The novelist generally arranges his work several 
years ahead, and one hears of it everywhere. 

I do not know if you have heard of the new illustrated 
edition-de-luxe of the novels of Charles Lever; it is a 
sumptuous publication, and when completed in its thirty- 
seven volumes, octavo, should transfigure the walls of a 
library. It is printed by Messrs. Constable & Co., of 
Edinburgh, on hand-made paper, and contains repro- 
ductions of all the original illustrations by " Phiz " 
and Cruikshank. Apparently, the publishers, Messrs. 
Downey & Co., have followed the style of the " Edin- 
burgh" Stevenson; certainly they deserve the success 
which attended that publication. 

We have been amused here by the statement made 
by the London correspondent of the New York " Book 
Buyer " that the editor of the " Athenaeum " was Mr. 
Theodore Watts-Dunton. Of course, as everyone knows, 
the editor is Mr. McColl; but the amusement comes 
home to the regular reader of the " Athenaeum " who 
would be prepared to admit, from internal evidence, 
that Mr. Bullock is not far out. If Mr. Bullock 
intended a joke, he made an excellent hit.

LIFE AND LETTERS OF MRS. STOWE.* 

Mrs. Fields's succinct Life of Mrs. Stowe 
contains so much that came originally from the 
lips or the pen of the heroine herself that it 
may not unfairly be termed an autobiography. 
The narrative of her early life is given mainly 
as she gave it to her son and biographer, the 
Rev. C. E. Stowe ; while her full and very 
frank letters to her friends supply the ground- 
work and substance of the rest of the story. 
Mrs. Fields's task has thus been mainly edi- 
torial. Her book is essentially and professedly 
a compilation of biographical material, rather 
than a biography proper ; but it is a compact 
and workmanlike production, full of pith and 
guiltless of padding ; and these are no small 
merits in a day when the mistaken liberality 
of most biographers insists upon giving us two 
fat volumes when one lean one would have 
sufficed. 

It is in the letters that the interest of Mrs. 
Fields's book chiefly lies, and it is to them that 
we shall confine our quotations. The later ones 
indicate clearly how genuine and deep-seated 
was Mrs. Stowe's devotion to the great cause 
with which her name is inseparably connected. 
The embers of the old wrath against the oppres- 
sor smouldered to the last. In a letter from 
Boston in 1882 to her married daughter the 
flame leaps up again. 

"... It [the Diary of John Quincy Adams] is a 
history of our own country through all the period of 
slavery usurpation that led to the war. The industry 
of the man in writing is wonderful. Every day's doings 
in the House are faithfully daguerreotyped, all the 
mean tricks, contrivances of the slave-power, and the 
pusillanimity of the Northern members from day to 
day recorded. Calhoun was then Secretary of State. 
Under bis connivance even the United States census 
was falsified, to prove that freedom was bad for negroes. 
Records of deaf, dumb, and blind, and insane colored 
people, were distributed in the Northern States, and in 
places where John Quincy Adams had means of proving 
there were no negroes. When he found that these fal- 
sified figures had been used with the English ambassador 
as reasons for admitting Texas as a slave State, the old 
man called on Calboun, and showed him the indus- 
triously collected proofs of the falsity of this census. 
He says: 'He writhed like a trodden rattlesnake, but 
said the census was full of mistakes; but one part bal- 
anced another it was not worth while to correct them.' 
His whole life was an incessant warfare with the rapidly 
advancing spirit of slavery, that was coiling like a ser- 
pent around everything. ... I cannot but love the

old man. He died without even seeing the dawn of 
liberty which God has brought; but oh ! I am sure he 
sees it from above. He died in the Capitol, in the 
midst of his labors, and the last words he said were, 
<This is the last of earth; I am content.' And now, I 
trust, he is with God. . . . All, all are gone. All that 
raged; all that threatened; all the cowards that yielded; 
truckled, sold their country for a mess of pottage; all 
the men that stood and bore infamy and scorn for the 
truth; all are silent in dust; the fight is over, but eter- 
nity will never efface from their souls whether they did 
well or ill whether they, fought bravely or failed like 
cowards. In a sense, our lives are irreparable. If we 
shrink, if we fail, if we choose the fleeting instead of 
the eternal, God may forgive us; but there must be an 
eternal regret! This man lived for humanity when 
hardest bestead; for truth when truth was unpopular; 
for Christ when Christ stood chained and scourged in 
the person of the slave." 

A letter to Dr. Holmes in 1876 gives us an 
inkling of Mrs. Stowe's later views on spiritual- 
ism a subject upon which, as her closer 
friends knew, she had at one time bestowed 
much thought. 

"... I remember a remark you once made on 
spiritualism. I cannot recall the words, but you spoke 
of it as modifying the sharp angles of Calvinistic belief, 
as a fog does those of a landscape. I would like to talk 
with you some time on spiritualism, and show you a col- 
lection of very curious facts that I have acquired through 
mediums not professional. I have long since come to 
the conclusion that the marvels of spiritualism are natural, 
and not supernatural, phenomena, an uncommon work- 
ing of natural laws. I believe that the door between 
those in the body and those out has never in any age 
been entirely closed, and that occasional perceptions 
within the veil are a part of the course of nature, and 
therefore not miraculous." 

A letter to Dr. Holmes of earlier date than 
the foregoing one refers interestingly to "Elsie 
Venner," which was then running its course in 
the " Atlantic." 

"... I know not what others may think of it, since 
I have seen nobody since my return; but to me it is of 
deeper and broader interest than anything you have done 
yet, and I feel an intense curiosity concerning that 
underworld of thought from which like bubbles your 
incidents and remarks often seem to burst up. The 
foundations of moral responsibility, the interlacing laws 
of nature and spirit, and their relation to us here and here- 
after, are topics which I ponder more and more, and on 
which only one medically educated can write well" 

A letter of Mrs. Stowe's to George Eliot, in 
which she seems to have expressed some mis- 
givings as to the reception of " Oldtown Folks " 
in England, elicited the following reply : 

" I have good hopes that your fears are groundless 
as to the obstacles your new book may find here from 
its thorough American character. Most readers who are 
likely to be really influenced by writing above the com- 
mon order will find that special aspect an added reason 
for interest and study; and I dare say you have long 
seen, as I am beginning to see with new clearness, that 
if a book which has any sort of exquisiteness happens 



also to be a popular, widely circulated book, the power 
over the social mind for any good is, after all, due to its 
reception by a few appreciative natures, and is the slow 
result of radiation from that narrow circle. I mean that 
you can affect a few souls, and that each of these in turn 
may affect a few more, but that no exquisite book tells 
properly and directly on a multitude, however largely it 
may be spread by type and paper. Witness the things the 
multitude will say about it, if one is so unhappy as to be 
obliged to hear their sayings. I do not write this cyn- 
ically, but in pure sadness and pity. Both travelling 
abroad and staying at home among our English sights 
and sports, one must continually feel how slowly the 
centuries work toward the moral good of man, and that 
thought lies very close to what you say concerning my 
religious point of view. I believe that religion, too, has 
to be modified according to the dominant phases; that 
a religion more perfect than any yet prevalent must 
express less care of personal consolation, and the more 
deeply awing sense of responsibility to man springing 
from sympathy with that which of all things is most cer- 
tainly known to us, the difficulty of the human lot." 

An amusing note to George Eliot from Mrs. 
Stowe, in 1872, contains a veiled personal allu- 
sion that may set the reader a-guessing. 

"... Yesterday we were both out of our senses with 
mingled pity and indignation at that dreadful stick of a 
Casaubon, and think of poor Dorothea dashing like a 
warm, sunny wave against so cold and repulsive a rock! 
He is a little too dreadful for anything; there does not 
seem to be a drop of warm blood in him, and so, as it 
is his misfortune and not his fault to be cold-blooded, 
one must not get angry with him. It is the scene in the 
garden, after the interview with the doctor, that rests 
on our mind at this present. There was such a man as 
he over in Boston, high in literary circles, but I fancy 
his wife was n't like Dorothea, and a vastly proper time 
they had of it, treating each other with mutual rever- 
ence, like two Chinese mandarins." 

James Russell Lowell's ardent admiration of 
Mrs. Stowe's work is eloquently expressed in a 
letter to her in regard to " The Minister's Woo- 

ing": 

"... Let your moral take care of itself, and remem- 
ber that an author's writing-desk is something infinitely 
higher than a pulpit. What I call care of itself ' is 
shown in that noble passage in the February number 
about the ladder up to heaven. That is grand preach- 
ing and in the right way. I am sure that ' The Minister's 
Wooing ' is going to be the best of your products hith- 
erto, and I am sure of it because you show so thorough 
a mastery of your material, so true a perception of re- 
alities, without which the ideality is impossible. . . . 
Woman charms a higher faculty in us than reason, God 
be praised, and nothing has delighted me more in your 
new story than the happy instinct with which you develop 
this incapacity of the lover's logic in your female char- 
acters. Go on just as you have begun, and make it ap- 
pear in as many ways as you like that, whatever creed 
may be true, it is not true, and never will be, that man 
can be saved by machinery. I can speak with some 
chance of being right, for I confess a deep sympathy 
with many parts of Calvanistic theology, and, . . . for 
one thing believe in hell with all my might, and in the 
goodness of God for all that ... 1 have not said any-

yourself go without regard to this, that, or t'other.

it. The native sod sends up the best inspiration to the 
brain, and you are as sure of immortality as we all are 
of dying, if you only go on with entire faith in your- 
self." 

Mrs. Fields's little book is brimful of good 
reading, and we earnestly recommend it to the 
younger generation especially, to whom the au- 
thor of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is already an his- 
toric figure and fading into the shadow-land 
of the nation's storied past. It contains the 
essence of a life- story that every American 
should be familiar with ; for the name of Harriet 
Beecher Stowe is writ large and bright on that 
page of our history of which we as a nation have 
the clearest reason to be proud. In our gratitude 
to the statesmen and soldiers of that great day 
let us not forget the part this fragile New En- 
gland woman bore in erasing from our national 
scutcheon its chief blot. Of all the moral forces 
that made for the right when the issue of slav- 
ery or no slavery was still a living one, there 
was certainly none more potent than her great 
book great in that it so marvellously wrung 
the heart and stung the conscience of a genera- 
tion grown apathetic in the sight of wrong, and 
because it carried with it from our shores a tidal 
wave of human feeling and loving-kindness, of 
sympathy with the oppressed and wrath against 
the oppressor, that rolled around the world. Har- 
riet Beecher Stowe was indubitably of the stuff 
of which the world's moral heroes are made. She 
loved the truth for its own sake, and clung to it 
the more when she found it unpopular; she pro- 
claimed it to all the world from the house- tops, at 
a time when even to whisper it in secret places 
meant obloquy. It is related that when Mrs. 
Stowe first called upon President Lincoln, in 
1862, he seized her hand, saying, " Is this the 
little woman who made this great war?" That 
was, of course, a kindly and half- playful exag- 
geration of the truth. Mrs. Stowe did not 
make the war; the social wrong it righted and 
the constitutional question it settled made it, 
and it must have come in the fulness of time 
had her book never been written. But that it 
came the sooner, and was the more welcome to 



those who waged it for humanity's sake, because 
of that book, there is no doubt. Through its 
winged words and moving pictures it keyed 
men's minds up to the heroic pitch and steeled 
the long-faltering heart of the North for the 
irrepressible conflict. As long as the history 
of our country continues to be read, the name 
of the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" will re- 
main one that all high spirits delight to honor. 

Mrs. Stowe's life was not lacking in the 
elements of storm and stress, and at one period 
of it she had more than a passing acquaintance 
with something very like poverty. But the 
end was tranquil a serene and slowly waning 
eventide of rest, after the toil and bustle of the 
day. Her pen, once so restlessly busy, was 
laid aside latterly, save for a brief, exceptional 
note to her closer friends. These missives are 
often tinged with a pathetic consciousness of 
failing powers and fading interests. Toward 
the end she wrote to Mrs. Howard : 

"... My mind wanders like a running brook, and 
I do not think of my friends as I used to, unless they 
recall themselves to me by some kind action. ... I 
think I am in something of the condition of the silk- 
worm who has spun out all his silk, and can spin no 
more, unless he has some fresh mulberry leaves. When 
I reach ' the golden shores ' where grow the trees of 
life, there I may be able to renew the happy friendships 
with those who have gone before and may come after 
me to that happy land. . . . My sun has set. The time 
of work for me is over. I have written all my words 
and thought all my thoughts, and now I rest me in the 
flickering light of the dying embers, in a rest so profound 
that the voice of an old friend arouses me but momen- 
tarily, and I drop back again into repose." 

Mrs. Fields has not thought fit to weave into 
the narrative much in the way of historical fact 
or comment, or of literary exposition and ap- 
preciation. She has given us a delightful and 
inspiring book, rich in biographical essentials, 
and it is likely to hold its place as the standard 
" Life " of Mrs. Stowe, until the time comes 
when a really critical and definitive one can be 
written. E. G. J. 



EX-PRESIDENT'S VIEWS or HIS 
COUNTRY.* 

It is interesting to learn what it is that an 
ex-president of the United States regards as 
" This Country of Ours." An inspection of 
Mr. Harrison's volume bearing that title shows 
that he considers it to be substantially the 
Executive branch of the Federal Government. 
He devotes 16 pages to the Constitution, 51

pages to Congress, 232 pages to the Executive, 
31 pages to the Judiciary, and no pages to 
state or municipal institutions. 

Of course this is hardly a balanced scheme, 
or one that gives an adequate view of the polit- 
ical life of the Republic. Congress and the 
courts play a larger part in the national drama 
than would appear from Mr. Harrison's sketch. 
Under our dual system of government, no ac- 
count is complete which omits the States. With 
the present tendencies of social development, 
any treatment is defective which omits muni- 
cipal structure and problems. So " This Coun- 
try of Ours " turns out to be a fragment. 
Perhaps an instructive collaboration would 
combine Ex-President Harrison, Speaker Reed, 
Justice Field, Ex-Governor Grover Cleveland, 
and Ex-Mayor Seth Low. Each of these could 
speak from wide knowledge, large views of 
things, unquestioned patriotism, and profound 
public confidence. A book which they would 
make would be a most unique and valuable 
contribution to political science. 

But if Mr. Harrison's little book is a frag- 
ment, nevertheless it is an interesting one. 
Besides being clear and accurate in its presen- 
tation of facts, it is interspersed with striking 
comments on the actual workings of govern- 
ment comments especially worthy of atten- 
tion as coming from one who knows, and whose 
judgment is so sane as is that of Mr. Harrison. 
A few of these comments may as well be quoted 
bodily. 

" The close of the Congress and the beginning of the 
President's term should be changed to May 4. This 
would make the ' short session ' available for something 
besides the appropriation bills, would diminish the 
chances of a Vice- Presidential succession, and save many 
useful lives for I do not doubt that the exposure and 
suffering endured by the parading organizations and by 
the spectators in 1881, 1889, and 1893, carried many 
people to premature graves " (page 94). 

This suggestion has been frequently made. It 
would seem eminently sensible and unobjec- 
tionable. SenatoB Mason of Illinois is inter- 
ested in the reform of Senate procedure. Will 
he undertake this reform also ? 

The Ex-President's comments on the ap- 
pointing power are worthy of note. 

" There can be no doubt that the participation of the 
Senate in the matter of appointments is larger than the 
Constitution contemplates. But as the President can, 
in the nature of things, know but little about the appli- 
cants for local offices, and must depend upon someone 
better informed than he to give him the necessary in- 
formation, it is quite natural that he should give weight 
to the advice of the Senator or Representative. It 
ought, however, to be admitted that as the responsibility 
rests upon the President he must be satisfied of the 



fitness of the appointment. That being satisfactorily 
established, the public interests are saved, for the choice 
between fit men is not very important. If there is any 
objection to the appointment, growing out of the char- 
acter or habits of the applicant, it is pretty sure to be 
brought out; and on the whole, considering the number 
of appointments the President is required to make with- 
out any personal knowledge of the appointees, the public 
service is well and honestly conducted. 

" The Civil Service Law has removed a large number 
of minor offices in the departments at Washington, and 
in the postal and other services, from the scramble of 
politics, and has given the President, the Cabinet officers, 
and the Members of Congress great relief; but it still 
remains true that in the power of appointment to office 
the President finds the most exacting, unrelenting, and 
distracting of his duties. In the nature of things he 
begins to make enemies from the start, and has no way 
of escape it is fate ; and to a sensitive man involves 
much distress of mind. His only support is in the good 
opinion of those who chiefly care that the public busi- 
ness shall be well done, and are not disturbed by the 
consideration whether this man or that man is doing it; 
but he hears very little directly from this class. No 
President can conduct a successful administration with- 
out the support of Congress, and this matter of appoint- 
ments, do what he will, often weakens that support. It 
is for him always a sort of compromise between his 
ideal and the best attainable thing" (pp. 109 sqq.~). 

It is clear that the independence of depart- 
ments, which was the dream of the framers, 
does not exist while the appointing power is 
in practice joint and not exclusive. There 
have been times when the President has been 
able to use his appointments as a strong lever 
for good legislation, as was the case in the extra 
session of 1893. Indeed, the prevailing ten- 
dency on the part of the people to trust the 
President more than the Congress, seems per- 
haps a sufficient reason for the fact that there 
is any substantial opposition to civil service 
reform. Many who have no liking for the 
spoils system are yet reluctant to deprive the 
President of an important means of control. 

On page 32, Mr. Harrison calls attention to 
another defect in the Federal Constitution, 
whereby the President is unable to veto items 
in an appropriation bill. Should such power 
be given, as has been done in several States, 
legislative log-rolling would at onee disappear. 
It is not to be expected that a reform like this 
could be carried easily. It is the converse of 
the President's means of controlling Congress- 
men by means of the appointing power, and 
Congress would not readily abandon it. But 
the Constitution ought to be amended in this 
sense. 

A very suggestive remark is made on page 
226. Our means of national defense have 
been discussed. Mr. Harrison then adds : 
" All these preparations and conditions will promote

arbitration, and, better still, the direct adjustment of 
international differences. What is won in a lawsuit is 
neither given with grace nor accepted with gratitude. 
A voluntary surrender of the brutal privilege of killing 
pregnant and nursing seals for their skins would be a 
better evidence of good-will than the most touching 
banquet utterances." 

The remark is commended to Great Britain. 

Mr. Harrison's book does not rank with that 
of Mr. James Bryce it is much simpler in 
scope. But it is a useful discussion, in a brief 
way, of matters which are worth discussing in 
many ways and from many points of view.

MR. ANDREW LANG'S BOUT WITH 
PROF. MAX MTJLLER.* 

In Professor Max Miiller's " Contributions 
to the Science of Mythology" (reviewed in 
THE DIAL for June 1, 1897), the great Ox- 
ford scholar made defense of the Etymologi- 
cal school of study, and battled against the 
Ethnopsychical or Anthropological school. 
While keeping his temper fairly well, the old 
man eloquent was polemic in attitude and made 
many thrusts at his enemies. His book has 
drawn out a reply in the volume before us 
" Modern Mythology," by Mr. Andrew Lang. 

Mr. Lang himself says of his book that it 
is "wandering and desultory," for Mr. Max 
Miiller's " attack is of a skirmishing character. 
Through more than eight hundred pages the 
learned author keeps up an irregular fire at 
the ideas and methods of the Anthropological 
school of mythologists. The reply must follow 
the lines of attack." The attitude of the An- 
thropological school is well known. It studies 
the mythologies of modern peoples, either lower 
races or the peasantry in higher peoples, in 
order to understand by comparison the myth- 
ology of ancient nations. In a sense, we find 
mythology in the making, among savages, bar- 
barians, and peasants. Customs and survivals 
may cast much light upon the past. Mr. Lang 
brings forth a good deal of argument in favor 
of the material, methods, and conclusions of 
the Anthropological school. It is incoherent 
to a degree, because the book is a "reply." 
The plan pursued is to select those passages of 
his opponent wherein direct assault is made, to 
present them, and then to answer them. Not 
content with a simple defense, Mr. Lang him-

self makes an occasional attack. Thus, in the 
Introduction, he says: 

"In agreement with Curtiusand many other scholars, 
we very sincerely doubt almost all etymologies of old 
proper names, even in Greek or Sanskrit. We find 
among philologists, as a rule, the widest discrepancies 
of interpretation. Moreover, every name must mean 
something. Now, whatever the meaning of a name (sup- 
posing it to be really ascertained), very little ingenuity 
is needed to make it indicate one or other aspect of 
Dawn or Night, of Lightning or Storm, just as the 
philologist pleases. Then he explains the divine or 
heroic being denoted by the name as Dawn or Storm, 
or Fire or Night, or Twilight or Wind in accordance 
with his private taste, easily accommodating the facts 
of the myth, whatever they may be, to his favorite 
solution. We rebel against this kind of logic, and per- 
sist in studying the myth in itself and in comparison 
with analogous myths in every accessible language." 

The topics of our author's chapters are nat- 
urally diverse. "Recent Mythology," "The 
Story of Daphne," " The Question of Allies," 
"Mannhardt," "Philology and Demeter Erin- 
nys," " Totemism," " The Validity of Anthro- 
pological Evidence," "The Philological Method 
in Anthropology," " Criticism of Fetichism," 
" The Eiddle Theory," "Artemis," these are 
all directed to meet Professor Miiller's criti- 
cisms and arguments. They take up, and in 
most cases satisfactorily deal with, the objec- 
tions. Two other chapters " The Fire Walk " 
and "Origin of Death" are apparently in- 
serted as illustrations of the Anthropological 
method. Both have appeared, at least in part, 
as essays in reviews. " The Fire Walk " pre- 
sents some particularly interesting material, 
though the treatment leads to no definite or 
clear result. The fire rite of the Hirpi on 
Mount Soracte is described. Striking parallels 
to it are found in Fiji, Malabar, New Zealand, 
Bulgaria, Trinidad, and in India. These also 
are described with some detail. In all these 
cases, human beings deliberately walk through 
fire, unharmed, usually with the purpose of se- 
curing some desired result. Curiously, Mr. 
Lang has overlooked one of the clearest and 
most striking cases of the "Fire Walk as it 
occurs in Japan, admirably described by Mr. 
Percival Lowell. FREDERICK STARR.

THE PRE-SHAKESPEARIAN DRAMA.* 

Perhaps the most important literary monu- 
ments of mediaeval England, outside of Chau- 
cer, are the ballads and the religious and moral 
plays. Professor Gummere's admirable vol- 
ume of " Old English Ballads," in the "Athen- 
aeum Press Series," is by far the best handbook 
for the study of the ballads ; though one might 
wish that the Appendices had been made into 
an Introduction and the present learned Intro- 
duction into an Appendix. The existing manual 
for the study of the English religious drama, 
Professor Pollard's " English Miracle Plays," 
was not a satisfactory book when it first ap- 
peared, in spite of its valuable prefatory essay ; 
while the work of a number of investigators 
during the past seven years, and especially the 
publication of Band I. of Creizenach's "Ges- 
chichte des Neueren Dramas " (Halle, 1893), 
have made a more adequate survey of the older 
English drama a necessity. 

The " Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean 
Drama," edited by Professor John M. Manly, 
of Brown University, Volumes I. and II. of 
which have just appeared in the " Athenaum 
Press Series," will therefore have no rival as a 
guide to the study of the early English drama. 
The general Introduction and the Notes and 
Glossary are reserved for Volume III.; but no 
one can note the wise system that has governed 
the selection of the texts in the present volumes, 
and read Professor Manly's careful Preface, 
without feeling convinced that the work is to be 
a most scholarly and an adequate presentation 
and interpretation of the beginnings of the En- 
glish drama. " The Introduction will trace the 
history of the drama on the Continent as well 
as in England from the beginning of the tenth 
century to the formation of the Scripture cy- 
cles, and then in England alone from that time 
to the end of the sixteenth century." 

Volume I., which contains about 650 pages, 
begins with certain liturgical plays in Latin. 
These were presented in English churches dur- 
ing the tenth century, although the accepted 
text- books are ignorant of the fact. With these 
are associated some fragments in English, with 
occasional bits of Latin, first published by Pro- 
fessor Skeat in 1890. That scholar conjectured 
that these scraps are a part of the lost Beverley 
cycle of biblical plays ; but Professor Manly is 
the first person to declare that they are some- 
thing far more precious : he believes them to be

Press Series). Boston : Ginn & Co. 



the only traces that have been found of the ver- 
nacular liturgical plays which existed within the 
churches in England while the Scripture cycles 
of the guilds flourished without. A miniature 
cycle of these guild plays is given by combining 
specimen scenes from all the extant cycles and 
the best of the isolated plays. This is a wise 
device. It is to be regretted, however, since it 
is so important in medieval religious thought, 
that " The Harrowing of Hell " has been en- 
tirely omitted. One play here given, the 
"Morality of Mankind," has never before been 
printed ; and several others have been either 
little known or practically inaccessible. Stu- 
dents will feel especially grateful for "The 
Play of the Sacrament." 

Volume I. ends with " The Four P's," by 
John Heywood, and Bale's " King John." Vol- 
ume II. contains "Roister Doister," " Gorbo- 
duc," and some later predecessors of the plays 
of Shakespeare. The editor prefers to discuss 
emendations in foot-notes, and not to admit 
them into the text ; and he never looks upon 
himself as a " literary adviser to the authors." 
All who are interested in the early history of 
the English drama will hope for the speedy 
appearance of Volume III.

Sealed " in the prologue which introduces the story. 
The advice is accepted, and the heroine proceeds to 
tell her story, all in the first person, and a story of 
strange and absorbing interest it turns out to be 
one of the best, in fact, that Sir Walter Besant has 
ever given us. Viewed in the retrospect of twenty 
years, the story of the heroine's life or rather of 
the few weeks of happiness that seem to her the 
whole of her life loses something of its tragic 
aspect in the soft embrace of a memory that has 
kept the tenderness rather than the pity of it all. 
For she tells us, speaking in the year 1780, how 
twenty years before she had been wooed and won 
by a youth who was all gentleness and devotion, 
and how the cup of happiness was snatched from 
her on the wedding morn. For the youth was no 
other than the Prince of Wales (albeit his rank had 
remained unknown to her), and the death of his 
grandfather called him to a throne that he would 
gladly have renounced for her sake, had it been 
possible. To accept this story at all, we must, of 
course, accept all the necessary attendant improba- 
bilities. That the lover should have concealed his 
rank from his sweetheart when it was known to all 
the world about her, and that George III. was ever 
such a youth as is here depicted, are things that 
strain the credulity, and will doubtless make earnest 
realists sniff with indignation. But the true lover 
of romance cares little for such considerations, and 
will be satisfied to find the story sweet in sentiment 
and skilfully contrived to sustain his interest. And 
then there undoubtedly is a certain amount of realism 
of the best sort in the book (for Sir Walter knows 
his eighteenth century England as few others know 
it), and there is much verisimiltude in the details 
of the narrative, however improbable be the central 
situation. 

Mr. Blackmore's new novel is described as " a 
romance of Surrey," but a just sense of proportion 
would have made the description run <4 a romance 
of Surrey and Daghestan." For the author has 
introduced into the peaceful vales of the English 
county an exiled Caucasian chieftain and his train 
(including one fair daughter), and about half the 
book is an account of the intrigues and blood-feuds 
of these wild tribesmen of the Caucasus, whether 
carried on in England or in their native mountains. 
We do not think that Mr. Blackmore has been well- 
advised in his choice of so fantastic a motive for 
his story, and have no idea that he really knows 
anything about Daghestan and its inhabitants. 
Neither the old chieftain nor his daughter is pre- 
sented with anything like convincing art, and the 
honest English squire who falls in love with Dariel 
seems much out of place in that galley. In the 
delineation of his English figures, of course, and in 
his descriptions of English country life, Mr. Black- 
more is here, as always, unsurpassable for shrewd- 
ness and accuracy of observation, while it need 
hardly be added that his style has a " body " which 
is grateful to the educated literary palate, for it is 
both rich and distinctive. 



The peculiar vain of fantastic romance based 
upon scientific conceptions, which has been cultiva- 
ted of late so successfully by Mr. H. G. Wells, 
reaches what is perhaps a climax of daring in his 
story of " The Invisible Man." The idea of the 
story is by no means new, but the treatment is dis- 
tinctly novel, for Mr. Wells's hero is no magician 
with the gift of fernseed, but a practical student of 
physics and physiology, who has hit upon a course 
of treatment whereby the refractive index of the 
human tissues may be equalized with that of the 
atmosphere, thus making the body invisible, just as 
certain jelly-fishes are practically invisible in the 
medium which they inhabit. Mr. Wells has not 
hesitated to think out his problem, and to face 
squarely all the minor details incident to this fan- 
tastic conception, which makes his treatment totally 
different from the hazy method of his predecessors 
who have attempted the same subject. For example, 
his invisible man must eat, and the food remains 
grotesquely visible until it is assimilated, thus neces- 
sitating his retirement from the neighborhood of men 
for some hours after a meal. Again, his blood, 
although invisible when in vital circulation, turns 
red when it is spilt and allowed to coagulate, as his 
entire body becomes visible at the end after he has 
been hunted down and killed. For the hero of this 
story is a monster as devoid of moral sentiment 
as the one created by Frankenstein, and he robs 
and slays without compunction until his career is 
rudely brought to an end. The whole thing is ex- 
tremely well managed, and all the probability 
possible is given to a situation which is inherently 
impossible. 

Mr. A. E. W. Mason, having recently made a 
rather unsuccessful venture in the fiction of modern 
English society, in " Lawrence Clavering " returns 
to the historical romance of his first love. The 
element of historical fact is somewhat slighter in 
this book than in most of its class, but we have 
sketches, such as they are, of such men as the Old 
Pretender, Bolingbroke, and Lord Derwentwater, 
for the story is of the year 1715, that witnessed the 
Stuart rising in England and the death of the Great 
Monarch in France. When, however, the author 
reaches the one historical occurrence that belongs to 
the immediate scheme of his narrative, the battle of 
Preston, he balks at the description, and leaves his 
readers to furbish it up for themselves. His story 
has a most adorable heroine, but a hero who takes 
so morbid and unnatural a view of his own conduct 
that he belongs rather to the introspective modern 
age than to the stirring period of Jacobite plot and 
intrigue in which he is set. Indeed, the " sin " for 
which he suffers such remorse and makes so great a 
sacrifice exists so wholly in his own imagination 
that the reader is a good deal puzzled to understand 
what all the fuss is about, and the bewilderment 
remains to the end of the novel. 

The by-ways of history afford so many oppor- 
tunities for the practitioner of historical romance 
that we are surprised to find so much attention con- 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

centrated upon a few favorite themes. Mr. Bloun- 
delle- Burton, at least, in his new novel, " The Clash 
of Arms," has got so far away from the beaten 
track as to write of the early campaigns of Marl- 
borough and Turenne and of the French conquest 
of Lorraine. The romance is one of sustained 
and singular interest, ingeniously planned, and well- 
proportioned in all its parts. It is one of the best 
books of its sort that we have read of recent years, 
and should do much to help its writer to the kind of 
popularity enjoyed by Mr. Stanley Weyman and Dr. 
Conan Doyle. 

There is something suggestive of good cabinet 
workmanship in the novels of Mr. Henry Seton 
Merriman. The nice adjustment of their parts, and 
the general polish of the works as wholes, are praise- 
worthy qualities, and go far to atone for the lack 
of anything like deep feeling or the vital delineation 
of character. These novels have, moreover, as a 
basis some carefully studied phase of recent history 
or social development that contributes considerably 
to their interest. "In Kedar's Tents," for example, 
has for its main theme the first Carlist rebellion in 
Spain, and incidentally, and by way of prologue, the 
Chartist agitation in England. It is a story that 
holds the attention, and is worked out to a satisfac- 
tory conclusion, although the exigencies of a pre- 
liminary serial publication forced a certain jerkiness 
into its development. 

Some time ago we reviewed a story of an imagin- 
ary fourth French empire, by a writer who evidently 
supposed that France had already lived through 
three actual empires. A variation upon this theme 
is now provided by Mr. Charles Benham's bulky 
and prolix romance entitled "The Fourth Napo- 
leon." We approached this book with pleasurable 
anticipations. It seemed attractive in appearance 
and theme, besides being of soul-satisfying length. 
But it turned out a very dull story after all, writ- 
ten in execrable English and with hardly a trace 
of the verisimilitude that must be the first and 
the last thing demanded of any such prospective 
exercise of the historical imagination. Besides, we 
have a right to expect a " fourth Napoleon " to 
accomplish stirring things and be a good deal of a 
hero in a cheap melodramatic way, instead of being 
the unspeakable cad and incredibly abject coward 
here presented to us. One might imagine a really 
thrilling story of the coup d'etat of some imperialist 
pretender, and of a war for the restoration of the 
lost French provinces, but Mr. Benham's story is 
incapable of producing a thrill, and meanders from 
episode to episode without display of dramatic en- 
ergy or grasp of any of the brilliant possibilities in- 
volved in such a plot as he has framed. 

" By Right of Sword " is just a story. It has no 
psychology, no pretence of delineative art, no waste 
of rhetoric upon descriptive setting, no subtlety of 
repartee, and hardly a tincture of historical basis. 
It is a story about Nihilist intrigue, but beyond the 
fact that it includes the assassination of a chief of 
police and an attempt upon the life of the Tsar, 



there is nothing in it that ever happened or would 
be likely to happen to anybody. It is, moreover, a 
piece of sensational melodrama, with the crudest of 
coloring, and founded upon an impersonation so 
utterly impossible that such stories as " The Pris- 
oner of Zenda" become absolutely convincing in 
the comparison. It is just a story, designed to en- 
tertain and not to instruct, and it accomplishes its 
purpose with more than reasonable completeness. 

"Queen of the Jesters " is the title given by Mr. 
Max Pernberton to a collection of eight imaginary 
episodes in the career of one Mademoiselle de Mon- 
tesson, described as " a famous figure in the Paris 
of Louis XV." She was, we are told, a beautiful 
and accomplished woman who " established herself 
in an old house in Hue St. Paul, and there, sur- 
rounded by a little band of wits, scientists, and ad- 
venturers, she made it her ambition to become 
acquainted with the dens of the city. To which end 
she practised a generous charity, and rescued more 
than one notorious rogue from the gibbet." Mr. 
Pemberton's stories introduce to our acquaintance 
a number of most engaging scoundrels, but they 
take us so very far into the region of the extrava- 
gant that they lose almost all semblance of contact 
with actual life, and prove but mildly exciting after 
all. 

Ingenuity is the most striking characteristic of 
Mr. Grant Allen's "An African Millionaire," which 
might almost be described as an inverted series of 
Sherlock Holmes stories. In other words, the in- 
genuity in this case is that displayed by a scamp 
who devises various ways of swindling a wealthy 
English speculator, instead of being the detective 
ingenuity displayed by the professional tracker of 
criminals. In consequence, the several episodes of 
this narration, although distinct stories, derive a 
certain unity from the rascal who figures in every 
one of them, just as the Sherlock Holmes episodes 
derived their unity from their detective hero. The 
Colonel Clay of this sheaf of stories is certainly a 
most attractive swindler, although it taxes the imag- 
ination to accept the various disguises in which he 
operates, and although the probabilities are severely 
strained in more ways than one. What we should 
like to read now would be a story in which Colonel 
Clay should be pitted against Sherlock Holmes in 
a desperate struggle of wits, and we confess that 
we do not know which of the two would come out 
ahead, which is perhaps the best tribute we can pay 
to the entertaining qualities of Mr. Allen's book.

From the novelty of its subject and its genuine 
importance to the experience of the race, " A His-

our Holiday books ; as, from its mechanical form and 
the variety and beauty of its illustrations, it is the 
most sumptuous. The text is translated from the 
French of Gaston Vuillier, and covers the subject 
from the earliest ages to the present moment. It 
begins with the dances of the Egyptians and Hebrews, 
illustrating them from old reliefs and the conceptions 
of modern painters, and ends with Loie Fuller and 
the modern ballet. In the Greek and Roman vases, 
reliefs, and figurines, and in the comments of con- 
temporaneous writers, the author finds ample mate- 
rial for his descriptions. It is a history of grace 
which we follow, and the variety and charm of its 
manifestations increase as the book proceeds. The 
Middle Ages and the Renaissance were prolific of 
ingenious devices to enhance the beauty of the dance, 
and many old manuscripts and engravings are 
drawn upon. There are descriptions of the Volte, 
the Parane, and the grand ballets in which Louis 
XIV. himself took part ; and these too are copiously 
and admirably illustrated. It is France that is con- 
sidered most carefully ; although the pastoral dances 
take one often to the land of Teniers, and the im- 
portance and influence of the Spanish dances is 
readily acknowledged. A chapter is given to these 
fascinating, langorous, seductive figures of Spain, 
a chapter epitomized in the reproduction of Sar- 
gent's commanding and irresistible " Carmencita." 
Modern Greek dances, the Italian Tarantella, and 
the movement of the Bayaderes, are each described 
in turn. The American Indian, even, is not entirely 
neglected, though little is made of his curious rites. 
But the dances of civilization are primarily the 
theme of the book. The modern dances of society 
and of the theatre occupy much space, and are illus- 
trated in the most alluring manner by such men as 
Whistler, Degas, Carrier- Bellense, Renouard, and 
Che'ret. In addition to those mentioned, there are 
plates in the book after Carpeaux, Aime', Morot, 
Watteau, Roybet, Stewart, and others; and near the 
beginning it is pleasant to find the little MacMonnies 
Bacchante. The volume as a whole has infinite 
variety and inexhaustible charm. 

The large oblong folio volume entitled " London 
as Seen by Charles Dana Gibson " (Scribner) strikes 
us as in one respect a little disappointing. A Lon- 
don flavor the book certainly has, but not a very 
pronounced one. Perhaps Mr. Gibson was not 
long enough within the sound of Bow Bells to quite 
catch the true note either of " Mayf air " or the 
purlieus ; perhaps his peculiar manner has so fixed 
and stereotyped itself that he cannot vary it mate- 
rially. At any rate, his London " types " show no 
marked departure from his familiar American ones. 
His London " swell " is his New York one, save for 
a slight Du Maurieresque touch superadded ; while 



his street characters have, in the same way, a differ- 
entiating savor of Phil May. But his pictures are 
nevertheless as delightful and entertaining as ever, 
and show that Mr. Gibson has lost none of his 
peculiar charm and verve. They are classified 
under such heads as " London Streets," " Parks," 
" Audiences," " Salons " and so on ; and they show 
us in a very graphic and spirited way at least the 
artist's impressions and fancies of contemporary 
life let us say London life " Gibsonized." And 
that is all that the title of the book warrants us in 
expecting. The volume is well made, and is easily 
one of the most striking of the season's publications. 

The fiftieth year of Longfellow's " Evangeline " 
is fitly signalized by the appearance of an extremely 
pretty and attractive edition of the poem (Hough- 
ton), with an introduction by Miss Alice Longfellow, 
and pictures and decorations by Miss Jessie Wilcox 
Smith and Miss Violet Oakley. One wishes the 
poet himself could see this captivating little volume, 
than which there is no more dainty or artistic gift- 
book on our list. The illustrations comprise ten 
full-page drawings in color, and a generous number 
of quaintly fancied headpieces in red and black. 
The artists are pupils of Mr. Howard Pyle, who 
has good reason to plume himself on their work, 
and does so in a brief introductory note. It is a 
long time since we have seen anything prettier in 
its way than Miss Smith's drawing of Evangeline, 
in the frontispiece illustrative of the line, " Fair in 
sooth was the maiden." The delicate face suggests 
a miniature on ivory, and the very slightly conven- 
tionalized landscape has a pleasingly poetical effect. 
No less meritorious artistically is the final plate 
showing Evangeline as a Sister of Mercy kneeling 
at the bedside of the dying Gabriel. The entire 
pictorial series leaves an agreeable impression of 
feminine delicacy and refinement, and one does not 
regret the absence of realism or the striving after 
the literal fact in the treatment. Mr. Longfellow's 
Evangeline and Gabriel are certainly not French- 
Canadian rustics or " Habitant " farm-folks as we 
know them ; and we see no good reason why his 
illustrators should give us plain prose where he has 
given us poetry. Miss Oakley's headpieces are 
nicely done, and are unmistakably in the manner 
of Mr. Pyle without being mere imitations. In her 
foreword, Miss Longfellow sketches the history of 
the poem, and chats pleasantly of her father. The 
cover is in dark-green and gold scarcely delicate 
enough in design, we think, to match harmoniously 
the pictorial ensemble. 

Mr. Walter Crane's graceful pencil has been em- 
ployed to advantage in the lavish decoration of 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers' dainty Holiday edition 
of Spenser's "The Shepheard's Calender." There 
are twelve quaint full-page plates, one to each " Aeg- 
logue "; and the text on each page is set in a frame 
of conventionalized vines and foliage gracefully in- 
tertwined. Besides the Eclogues, the volume con- 
tains E. K.'s Epistle to Gabriel Harvey, the "Gen- 
eral Argument," two pages of Notes, and a Glossary.

THE DIAL 



The text is printed on rather thick hand-made paper 
just touched with a creamy parchment tint that 
strengthens the pleasantly archaic impression of the 
whole. The cover is of sea-green linen stamped 
with a charming design in colors, that shows us some 
"vacant shepherd of the dale" piping to his flock, 
while his dog stands at his side and a pair of white 
doves are cooing and courting in the branches over- 
head. Mr. Crane's designs are instinct with the 
spirit of the sweet and quaint old verses, and his 
" Cuddies " and " Perigots " and " Colin Clouts " are 
true shepherds of the ancient pastoral, and such as 
old Spenser himself might have conceived. The little 
volume is in flawless taste throughout, and has all the 
essentials of the specific gift-book. 

In a handsome volume of 490 pages, Colonel 
Henry Inman, a veteran officer of our Regular 
Army, tells the story of " The Old Santa Fe" Trail " 
(Macmillan). It can scarcely fail to occur to the 
thoughtful reader of this engrossing book that the 
current conception of American history, as gained 
from the text-books and manuals in common use, 
is singularly narrow and one-sided. The story of 
the magnificent pioneering exploits of the Spaniards, 
and of our own subsequent conquest and develop- 
ment of the vast Western and Southwestern territory 
which they were the first to enter and to settle, has 
been curiously neglected. There is no chapter in 
this story that is richer in the essential elements of 
romance, or of greater and more absorbing interest 
to the American reader, than the one contained in 
Colonel Inman's book. The Old Santa F<5 Trail 
was once the great highway from the lower Mis- 
souri River to New Mexico. The first European 
to traverse it was De Vaca, a Spanish explorer of 
the sixteenth century. De Vaca was the precursor 
of the later caravans of pack-mules and " prairie- 
schooners," which in their turn gave way to the swift 
trains of the great Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe* 
Railway, which now spans the continent, and for 
nigh a thousand miles of its romantic course par- 
allels and often coincides with the Old Trail. Thus 
the tourist who is whirled in a palace car over this 
route is traversing storied ground, where nearly 
every stream and hill and dale has its tale of peril 
or adventure. The thrilling story of the Old Trail 
and its doughty heroes, " Kit " Carson, Beckwourth, 
Wooton, Maxwell, etc., is told sympathetically and 
in full detail by Colonel Inman. His book has a 
distinct historical value, and it is as readable as a 
romance of Scott or Stevenson. It is a book wherein 
American patriotism and national pride may find 
true nourishment ; and therefore it is a book that 
every American youth ought to read. Print and 
paper are notably good, and the eight full-page 
photogravure plates from drawings by Mr. Frederick 
Remington are in some respects the best work that 
we have seen from his truth-telling pencil. Besides 
these plates there are many illustrative initials and 
tail-pieces by Mr. Thomson Willing. A good map 
of the Old Trail greatly aids the imagination of the 
reader. We heartily commend this book as a speci- 



ally useful and acceptable gift to a well-grown boy. 
We venture to say that he will read it and re-read 
it, and acquire thereby an indelible impression of 
an important phase of his country's history. 

The rich exterior, liberal pictorial attractions, 
and universally engaging theme of Mr. Justin Mc- 
Carthy's "Life of Gladstone" (Macmillan) have 
led us to include it in the present category, though 
it calls for much fuller treatment than can be ac- 
corded it here. To our thinking, Mr. McCarthy's 
facile pen has never been employed better than in 
this engaging volume. The theme was eminently 
one to his taste, and one that he was in some respects 
exceptionally qualified to handle. He had studied 
Mr. Gladstone's career as it progressed, step by step, 
ever since he was old enough to take an interest in 
public affairs ; he had sat by his side in the House 
of Commons for many years; he had borne an active 
part in some of the great parliamentary battles with 
which Mr. Gladstone's name is most intimately asso- 
ciated; he had advised with him frequently, and 
been admitted to his friendship. To those who have 
read Mr. McCarthy's histories of our own times, we 
may say that his life of Gladstone is very similar 
in treatment to those pleasantly informing books. 
There is the same rapid yet discriminating touch, 
the same reminiscential, almost chatty, tone. The 
book is rich in brief and pithy characterizations of 
men and measures, and abounds in those striking 
turns of thought and phrase that fix the attention 
and stamp themselves on the memory. We heartily 
commend this spirited account of the greatest En- 
glish statesman perhaps one may say Englishman 
of Victorian times to those in quest of a gift- 
book of the more substantial sort. There are a 
great variety of portraits and other illustrations, 
full-page and vignette. 

" The Madonna in Art" (L. C. Page & Co.), by 
Miss Estelle M. Hurll, is a condensed review of the 
varying methods of treating this enduring subject. 
The work does not pretend to be either critical or 
technical ; it is merely a popular treatise on a pop- 
ular subject. The material is interesting and the 
author is well-informed, these are the merits of 
the book ; but if she had the courage of her opin- 
ions it would have more individuality. In a way, 
everything is reduced to a level ; and the conven- 
tional and traditional judgments are the ones usually 
expressed. It is not a subject which easily calls 
forth originality, yet it has been so profoundly 
studied that a new consideration of it needs to be 
justified by a very personal point of view. The 
author's classification of the pictures is curious and 
a little distracting. Instead of grouping them by 
periods or by schools, she divides them by certain 
characteristics of the pictures themselves, devoting 
one chapter to the Madonna enthroned, another to 
the pastoral Madonna, and grouping the others by 
similar schemes. In the second part of the book, 
the classification is a little more spiritual. But it 
is a confusing system, which leaves one with no very 
definite impression of anything. The book is not a

study, it is familiar description; and some of it is 
well written. It is illustrated with many inferior 
reproductions of masterpieces, and adorned with a 
cover in the Virgin's colors. 

Mr. William Nicholson is to the fore this year, 
following up rapidly the great success of his jubilee 
portrait of the Queen. In addition to his clever 
" Alphabet " mentioned in our last issue, he pub- 
lishes "An Almanac " (Russell), with words by Mr. 
Rudyard Kipling. The twelve drawings are bril- 
liantly individual, for Mr. Nicholson's style is all 
his own ; the character in his figures is expressed 
as no one else would express it. They are drawn 
in broad sweeps of the brush, with a bit of color to 
enliven the blacks and browns, but with few lines, 
and those very expressive. The personality is be- 
fore one, convincingly, vividly, the impression of 
it, within as well as without. You are made to 
understand what manner of man is before you. 
There is action in the figures, or the repose after 
action, and the dogs and horses are alive and in 
full cry. The originality of the work is extraordi- 
nary and delightful. Mr. Kipling's verses are, 
most of them, pleasant nonsense, but the one on 
" Boxing " goes deeper. 

" Read here the Moral roundly writ 

For him that into battle goes 
Each soul that, hitting hard and hit, 

Encounters gross or ghostly foes : 

Prince, blown by many overthrows 
Half blind with shame, half choked with dirt 

Man cannot tell but Allah knows 
How much the other side was hurt ! " 

A fitting gift-book for a friend of sportsmanlike 
proclivities may be found in " The Gallinaceous 
Game Birds of North America " (Francis P. Har- 
per). Forty-four species are included, beginning 
with " Bob White " and ending with the wild turkey; 
and each is illustrated in an admirable engraving 
executed by Mr. Edwin Sheppard. A color-chart 
and a key for the identification of the species are 
also given. The text is by Dr. Daniel G. Elliot, and 
is all that we might expect from the hand of one 
distinguished by a lifetime of wide and careful re- 
search in various departments of ornithology. It 
is intended primarily for the advantage of the 
sportsman, and the author writes with keen enthu- 
siasm of the qualities that constitute a noble game- 
bird. Chiefly on account of the traits which give 
zest to the pastime of the hunter, Dr. Elliot assigns 
to the gallinaceous birds the first and most import- 
ant place among the feathered tribes. None can 
dispute their value in the history of mankind. Dr. 
Coues lends credence to the statement that " the 
total output of the poultry industry, in the shape of 
hens' eggs alone, exceeds annually that of all the 
mines of gold, silver, and other precious metals." 
The annual crop of feathers derived from the gal- 
linaceous birds forms no inconsiderable item in the 
commerce of the world. The race can boast like- 
wise of varied and extreme beauty of attire, and of 
many intelligent and attractive characteristics ; and 
yet the genuine lover of the "tribes of burning- 



plumage and of choral voice," who is content to 
follow them with an opera-glass instead of a fowling- 
piece, will experience a shock of surprise that one 
who has known them long and intimately can pre- 
fer such a fall before the gun to those that delight the 
artistic sense alone with their grace of bearing and 
charm of song. Dr. Elliot treats his theme in an 
easy, masterful manner, keeping it at every point 
within the comprehension of the average reader. 

Eight full-page drawings by Mr. Louis Agassiz 
Fuertes, the artist who seems to be a genuine suc- 
cessor to Audubon in the use of the pencil, embel- 
lish the series of studies made by Mr. H. E. Park- 
hurst of "Song Birds and Water Fowl" (Scribner). 
The author has been a persistent and keen observer 
of bird-life, as this work and his " Birds' Calendar," 
produced several years ago, attest. Several chap- 
ters in the present work are devoted to water birds; 
one is occupied with birds' nests, another with " Mis- 
tress Cuckoo," and one with a big "bouquet of song 
birds." 

Fresh and racy in flavor, and deftly rhymed, are 
the verses in the pretty book entitled "The Habit- 
ant, and Other French-Canadian Poems" (Putnam), 
by Dr. Henry Drummond. Our readers are not 
unfamiliar with the pleasant qualities of Dr. Drum- 
mond's verse and the selections in the present vol- 
ume show him at his best. The queer French- 
Canadian dialect is capitally reproduced, with an 
effect sometimes comic and sometimes extremely 
pleasing and poetical, owing mainly, perhaps, to the 
frequent use of pretty French words in place of 
their harsher English equivalents. The following 
stanzas, descriptive of Spring, may serve as samples 
of Dr. Drummond's verse, and of " English as she 
is spoke" by the " Habitants " in the lower Province : 

" Dat 's very nice tarn for wake upon de morning 
An' lissen de rossignol sing ev 'ry place, 
Fal sout' win' a-blowin' see clover a-growin' 
An' all de worl' laughin' itself on de face. 

" Mos' ev'ry raf ' it is pass on de rapide 
De voyageurs singin' some ole chanson 

' Bout girl down de reever too bad dey mus' leave her, 
But comiu' back soon wit' beaucoup d'argent." 

The volume contains an Introduction by Mr. Louis 
Frechette, the French- Canadian poet-laureate ; and 
the eleven full-page plates in photogravure and 
illustrative vignettes, one for each poem, serve to 
rank it well up among the prettier gift-books of the 
season. 

A careful work upon "Portrait Miniatures" 
(Macmillan) is written by Mr. George C. William- 
son, Litt.D. The subject is studied from the time 
of Holbein, 1531, to that of Sir William Ross, 1860. 
Yet the author does not pretend to compete with 
Dr. Propert's work on the same subject, but appeals 
to a class for which the latter is too sumptuous to 
be accessible. Without pretending to be final or 
infallible, he has prepared his treatise carefully on 
a basis of sound knowledge and wide experience. 
It is addressed to the collector who is still something 
of a novice, and it contains much special and even 
technical information which he would find invalua-

ble. It has an attraction, too, even for the indif- 
ferent, and the unwary may be led into temptation 
by a perusal of its absorbing pages, in which nothing 
is of so much importance as the correct identifica- 
tion of a miniature. It is largely a history of English 
miniaturists, only one brief chapter being devoted to 
continental painters. But the author's researches 
have been so extensive that some new material has 
been brought to light, and he is able to give in- 
teresting descriptions of the careers of the early 
painters. We find that the successful miniaturist of 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a man 
of mark who held his own with, the distinguished 
men of the day. Not only the great ladies of the 
land, but the courtiers and statesmen, sat for Rich- 
ard Cosway and Andrew Plimer. Their studios 
were filled with the importunate great, and the for- 
tunes they gained enabled them to live in luxury. 
Cosway, however, in spite of his success, was much 
ridiculed by the wits of the day because of " his 
luxurious habits, his dandified and elaborate costume, 
and his fondness for wearing a sword." Mr. Wil- 
liamson tells these stories gaily, and his clear simple 
style is excellent. The work of the different paint- 
ers is differentiated with lucidity and justice. We 
feel that he knows his subject and is impatient of 
any degradation. The book is illustrated with in- 
numerable reproductions of miniatures in the most 
famous collections, a still more tangible suggestion 
of the beauty and delicacy of this exquisite art. 

There are doubtless more sumptuous books for 
the holidays than those published by Mr. Thomas 
B. Mosher, of Portland, but assuredly there are none 
that are in the strictest sense more choice, more 
satisfactory to the instincts of refined lovers of books, 
or more ideally adapted for use as Christmas remem- 
brances. Mr. Mosher's list for the present season 
includes ten new numbers. The " Old World " series 
is represented by the sonnets of Michael Angelo, in the 
translation of the late John Addington Symonds ; 
Mr. Andrew Lang's " Helen of Troy," including the 
author's essay on the myth of Helen, omitted from 
the earlier American reprint; Mr. Swinburne's 
" Atalanta in Calydon," which needs no word of 
comment or praise ; and the " Sonnets from the 
Portuguese," of which we cannot have too many 
editions. Mr. Gosse's essay, reprinted from " Critical 
Kit-Kats," serves a& a preface to this edition of Mrs. 
Browning's sonnets. To the " Bibelot " series, two 
additions are made. One of them is the " Long 
Ago " of the two ladies who write under the name of 
" Michael Field." This exquisite book, heretofore 
printed in an edition limited to one hundred copies, 
is an attempt to extend the Sapphic fragments into 
complete lyrics : a bold undertaking, certainly, but 
not without a certain measure of relative success in 
the performance. The other " Bibelot " is " An 
Italian Garden," a book of lyrics by Madame James 
Darmesteter (A. Mary F. Robinson). In the 
" Brocade " series, we have three new booklets 
printed on Japan vellum. The first is Walter Pater's 
version of the Cupid and Psyche story from Apuleius, 



known to all readers of " Marius the Epicurean," 
and particularly deserving of this detachment from 
its setting. The second is " The Story without an 
End," translated from the German of F. W. Carove 
by Sarah Austin, and first published in London in 
1834. The third is a translation, by Miss Lucie 
Page, of the two famous prose poems, " The 
Centaur " and " The Bacchante," by Maurice de 
Gue"rin. The last of Mr. Mosher's publications to 
be mentioned is the most important of all. It begins 
a new series called " Reprints of Privately Printed 
Books," and gives us the nine essays in literary 
criticism contributed anonymously by Walter Pater 
to " The Guardian." These were rescued about a 
year ago from the files of the periodical for which they 
were written, and, at the instance of Mr. Gosse, were 
printed in a private edition of one hundred copies. 
Mr. Mosher's present reprint of the book is as close 
a facsimile as it is possible to produce without the 
aid of photography. It is an exquisite book, and 
will be cherished by all who are fortunate enough 
to secure it. 

Mr. W. G. Colesworthy, a Boston publisher, has 
followed rather closely the example set by Mr. 
Mosher, and put forth a very pretty volume of 
poems by Rossetti. " The White Ship : A Little 
Book of Poems " is the title of this charming pub- 
lication, which is printed in italic type on hand- 
made paper, and bound in boards with white back 
and blue sides. The margins are wider than those 
affected by Mr. Mosher, but the book is otherwise 
very similar to the familiar " Bibelot " and " Old 
World " publications. 

What could be more appropriate for a Christmas 
book than a study of the great epic of the Christian 
life? Such a study is offered us in " Dante's Vision 
of God" (Scott, Foresman & Co.), an essay by Mrs. 
Caroline K. Sherman, published in a pretty brochure, 
with an exquisitely designed rose for adornment of 
the board cover. Mrs. Sherman's paper is a sym- 
pathetic and gracefully-written interpretative study 
of that revelation of the divine which Dante clothed 
with such splendor of imaginative and harmonious 
diction, and which is essentially one with the ulti- 
mate message of all the great philosophers, from 
Plato to Spinoza. " Blessed are the pure in heart 
for they shall see God," so runs the deepest of the 
Beatitudes, and the "Paradiso" shows us what the 
promise meant to that poet whose intensity of spir- 
itual vision has never been equalled in literature. 
From the consideration of this *' vision," the writer 
is led, in conclusion, to a fine statement of the mes- 
sage which Dante has for all ages, and most of all 
for our own. " It is the message of an age, poor 
in science, but wonderfully rich in spiritual worth, 
to an age rich in science, but too often forgetful of 
the fact that material good has its highest value only 
as it is transmuted into spiritual power." The illus- 
trative extracts included in this booklet are taken 
from Gary and Longfellow, and (for the original) 
from what is essentially the text of the Oxford 
Dante. Our only quarrel is with the essayist's spell-

ing of Virgil with an " e," a vagary against which 
we always feel bound to protest. There are a few 
vexatious misprints in the Italian text. 

" A Book of Old English Love Songs " (Mac- 
millan) is one of the more artistic and charming of 
the holiday gift-books. It is enriched with an 
ornate gilt cover and many decorative drawings by 
Mr. George Wharton Edwards. They have grace 
and beauty, these designs, and they adjust them- 
selves admirably to the rich and exquisite loveliness 
of the fine old songs. The familiar ones are printed 
from Shakespeare, Jonson, Waller, Herrick, and 
others, and they are the more welcome because we 
know them. The list includes also some songs less 
familiar, but too fine to merit our forgetfulness. 
Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie has written a grace- 
ful introduction. 

The elegantly ornate setting bestowed by its pub- 
lishers on Mr. Archer M. Huntington's "A Note- 
Book in Northern Spain" (Putnam) seems to war- 
rant the inclusion of the work in the present cate- 
gory. Mr. Huntington is a good observer, and his 
book rises in style as well as substance above the 
average of its class. His view of Spain is tinged 
with sentiment, and is rather favorable on the whole. 
Her decline from her ancient high estate to her pres- 
sent low rating among European nations he attrib- 
utes to her lack of the trading spirit. For seven 
centuries she was a battlefield, employing the flower 
of her manhood and draining her resources in bar- 
ring the gate of the Christian fold against the Mo- 
hammedan wolf. While she was fighting, the more 
fortunately situated nations to the north of her were 
trading and intermingling and gradually evolving 
the modern form of industrial civilization, with its 
corollaries, political freedom, tolerance, a recogni- 
tion of the dignity and worth of labor. Spain fell 
far behind in the race of national development ; and 
she stands to-day a belated mediaeval figure strangely 
tricked out in certain ill-worn odds and ends of mod- 
ern political bravery, rich in nothing save in that 
inextinguishable pride 

" which she to all the earth 

May largely give, nor fear herself a dearth." 

Up to the beginning of the present Cuban war, as 
Mr. Huntington thinks, a somewhat better condition 
of things seemed likely to prevail. A tendency to 
develope on certain modern lines was growingly 
manifest ; and even now, in perhaps the darkest hour 
that Spain has known, there is that in the essential 
character of her people that fosters a faith in her 
ultimate progress. The volume is clearly printed 
on calendered paper, and contains one hundred illus- 
trations of good quality. 

One of the interesting features of the Holiday 
publishing season for many years has been the an- 
nual selection of Christmas cards and calendars 
issued by Messrs. L. Prang & Co. of Boston. Their 
productions for this season are even more attractive 
than usual, consisting of about a score of new Christ- 
mas cards, each with appropriate floral design in 
colors, and an equal number of artistic calendars. 



Among the latter may be mentioned, as especially 
pleasing, " Dream Roses," designed by Miss Laura 
C. Hills ; " Daisies Dear," " Dream Pansies," and 
"Forget-me-not," by Miss Bessie Gray; and " Queenly 
Roses," " The Sea Shore Calendar," and " My Lady 
Pansy," by various other artists. It is interesting 
to note that all of Messrs. Prang & Co.'s publica- 
tions are designed, lithographed, and printed in this 
country. 

Mr. John Corbin's articles in " Harper's Round 
Table " on " School Boy Life in England " are now 
issued by the same firm in book form. Mr. Corbin 
describes in an interesting way life at the great public 
schools of Winchester, Eton, and Rugby, and draws 
some instructive comparisons between the English 
system and our own. A public school in England 
is not, of course, as with us, a school to which any- 
one is free to go without paying. Such a school is 
there termed a national school, our own nearest 
equivalent to the English public school being the big 
preparatory school, such as Andover, Exeter, St. 
Paul's, Groton, etc. Mr. Corbin prepared himself 
for his task by going to live for a short period at 
Winchester, Eton, and Rugby, where he lost no 
opportunity of associating and conversing with the 
masters and boys and of getting as near to their 
actual life as possible. The book deals less with the 
strictly scholastic than with the social side of this 
life ; and we need scarcely say that the formative 
influence of the latter side upon the character of the 
English public-school boy is as potent as that of the 
former. Dr. Arnold of Rugby saw this fact very 
clearly ; and it was in the " houses " and on the 
playground, even more than in the class-room, that 
his gracious and elevating influence was felt. Besides 
giving us the fruit of his own observations, Mr. 
Corbin has consulted the authorities ; and he has 
revised and somewhat enlarged his " Round Table " 
articles to fit them for book form. His treat- 
ment is critical as well as descriptive ; and his little 
book should interest and amuse young readers as 
well as adults. It is tastefully gotten up, and the 
eighteen photographic plates are well chosen and 
well made. 

In " Social Life in Old Virginia " (Scribner), 
Mr. Thomas Nelson Page has tried to give a picture 
of the lovely side of the Southern civilization before 
the War. His preface deplores the fact that so 
much of our conception of the South at that time 
is derived from Mrs. Stowe ; and the descriptions 
that follow are naturally far more genial. It is 
well to have this plantation life which has passed 
away the most picturesque and courtly that our 
country has ever known thus portrayed for us 
by one who was born to its traditions. The illus- 
trations, by the Misses Cowles, admirably suggest 
the grace and beauty of the Southern life and its 
strange contrasts. 

Miss H. A. Guerber, author of the popular little 
book on the "Stories of the Wagner Opera," now 
offers a kindred one entitled "Stories of Famous 
Operas" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), briefly outlining the

plots of the favorite French, German, and Italian 
operas. The narratives are taken from the orig- 
inal librettos, and are so written as to enable the 
reader to follow in fancy the action of the piece in 
all its details precisely as it is given on the stage. 
The titles comprise Faust, Carmen, A'ida, The 
Huguenots, Don Giovanni, Fidelio, Mignon, Le 
Cid, Martha, Norma, Cavalleria Busticana, etc. 
Besides outlining the dramatic action, the author 
gives a few leading facts as to composers. The 
publishers have mounted the book attractively, the 
illustrations comprising portraits, striking dramatic 
scenes, views of famous theatres, etc. The volume 
is pleasantly written, and its uses are obvious. 

Miss Mary E. Phillips has prepared a volume of 
" Reminiscences of William Wetmore Story " (Rand, 
McNally & Co.) which, without pretending to be a 
biography, provides an outline sketch of the life of 
the famous sculptor and man of letters. " Incidents 
and anecdotes chronologically arranged," is the 
author's modest description of her work. The let- 
ters and reminiscences of Story's contemporaries, 
both published and unpublished, have been liberally 
drawn upon for material, and both Browning and 
Lowell figure conspicuously among the friends upon 
whom tribute is levied. The book is handsomely 
illustrated, and made attractive both by its mechan- 
ical execution and the loyalty of friendship that 
informs its contents. 

We have testified more than once to the merits 
of New York's sprightly little periodical, " Life," 
which is, in this country certainly, without a rival 
in its peculiar field. Its pictures are artistic, and 
often charming ; its tone is refined ; it bubbles over 
with fun that is never coarse or offensive ; in short, 
it is a paper that ladies and gentlemen may read, 
and no one need shun. It bears much the same rela- 
tion to its respectable London prototype, " Punch," 
that a glass of champagne does to a pot of rather 
flat porter. The Scribners now issue a " second 
series" of selected pictures from "Life," under the 
title " Life's Comedy." There are 150 pictures in 
all, and they are divided into four groups, " Belles 
and Beaux," " In Cupid's Realm," " Fads and Fan- 
cies," " Out of Doors." They are worthy of their 
new setting; and the comely volume containing 
them forms a capital means of enlivening an even- 
ing and diverting a group of one's friends. 

"Flying Leaves" (E. R. Herrick & Co.) is the 
title of a thin oblong quarto volume containing char- 
acteristic selections from that sometimes really artist- 
ic and usually excruciatingly funny German weekly, 
" Fliegende JBlaetter." The specimens given are 
fairly representative ones, but they are rather coarse- 
ly reproduced. The volume will form an acceptable 
present for those who enjoy the humorous side of 
things. 

Mr. Elbert Hubbard's " Little Journeys to the 
Homes of Famous Women" (Putnam) give some 
interesting accounts of the homes of Mrs. Brown- 
ing, Jane Austen, Miss Martineau, Mary Lamb, 
Christina Rossetti, Madame de Stae*!, Empress 



Josephine, and other famous women ; and to each 
paper is prefixed a portrait of its heroine. These 
portraits are well made and interesting especially 
those in the quaint plate showing Charles and Mary 
Lamb. Besides the local descriptions, the papers 
contain much pleasant biographical chat and anec- 
dote, and literary and general criticisms. 

The Stokes Company publish a second and 
modified edition of Professor AtwelFs selected 
" Pensees of Joubert." This time the original 
French is omitted, and the volume is reduced in 
size to a pocketable booklet of 135 tiny pages, ex- 
clusive of the brief biographical and appreciative 
Introduction. It has a portrait and an index. The 
dainty pages fairly sparkle with felicities of thought 
and diction, and amply warrant the saying of Mr. 
Ludlow, who introduced the author to English read- 
ers, that " to glance over Joubert's Pensbes is like 
uncovering a tray of diamonds." 

Mrs. Lucia A. Palmer's "Oriental Days " (Baker 
and Taylor Co.) is a book of travels in Egypt and 
the Holy Land, wherein the writer recounts her 
own rather slender experiences, and ekes out the 
recital with Various remnants of information, histor- 
ical, political, and archaeological, culled from various 
authorities. The volume is a royal octavo, well 
printed and ornately bound, and enriched with full- 
page photographic plates. 

Mr. H. C. Christy has been ambitious enough to 
illustrate "Hamlet" (Dodd), but he has nothing 
new to say upon the subject. The drawings are 
not without cleverness, but they are not Hamlet. 
And one shrinks from the touch of any but the 
greatest hands upon that masterpiece. The Ophelia 
of this artist is almost ludicrous, and the Prince 
nearly as bad. It is much better to imagine them. 
The King, in the frontispiece and on page 149, is 
conceived much more effectively. 

It was a happy idea to have Madeleine Lemaire 
illustrate " Lucile " (Stokes), if the idea of re- 
printing the poem can be said to be happy, for 
her pretty sentimentality is well adapted to the 
false emotions and sing-song rhythm of Owen 
Meredith's great effort. The water-colors are well 
reproduced in color, and the drawings in black-and- 
white, by Mr. C. McCormick Rogers, are fairly 
good. 

Anew edition of Sterne's " Sentimental Journey " 
(Longmans) is decorated with many clever designs 
by Mr. T. H. Robinson, which are almost as charm- 
ingly beguiling as the text. This edition will doubt- 
less prove a favorite with the lovers of this genial 
classic. It is fastidiously printed, and has the 
bibliographical merit of being an exact reprint of 
the first edition (that of 1768, in two volumes), the 
only changes or alterations being the correction of a 
few obvious errors of the printer. 

A book of photographic views of " Central Berk- 
shire" (Pittsfield: George Blatchford) gives an 
idea of the beauty of these Massachusetts hills and 
villages. The pictures are admirably taken, and 
suggest the peaceful loveliness of that rare country.

BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 

u. 

The fairies are sadly neglected by this year's writers, 
who should therefore live in fear of their revenge. For 
the fairies can endure neglect much better than the 
writers can; they are perennial, they are eternally lov- 
able, while the poor author is but the creature of a day. 
If he wishes to lengthen his short span of life, he must 
invoke their aid, he must ingratiate himself with them. 
Yet only a few out of the crowd have been wise enough 
to appreciate this truth. The real thing reaches us this 
year from the far north, as it did once before when 
Andersen led the enchanted children into a beautiful 
new country. These " Fairy Tales from the Far North " 
(A. C. Armstrong & Son) were written by P. C. Asbjorn- 
sen, and translated from the Norwegian by Mr. H. L. 
Brakstad, who has given us other folk-stories by this 
writer. The original illustrations by Sinding and Weren- 
skiold are reproduced, and they translate the spirit of 
the stories much more sympathetically than foreigners 
could have done. The ever-present troll would have 
been a difficult subject to one who was not familiar with 
him from childhood. The author's invention never flags; 
his plots are extraordinarily rich in incident, too varied 
sometimes, too abrupt in their changes. Yet they do 
not allow one's interest to abate, and they are told with 
unusual vivacity. Though they have some of the delight- 
ful old characters common to all folk-lore, they are in- 
tensely, almost aggressively, original. Children would be 
continually diverted by their surprises. Their directness 
is sometimes harsh and their simplicity curt, yet it is 
extraordinary work. We know of nothing quite like it. 
There is much humor, sometimes rather grim, in the 
tales, but they have not the tenderness of Andersen's, 
nor his occasional sentimentality, nor his large-hearted 
human sympathy. 

" The Pink Fairy Book " (Longmans), edited by the 
indefatigable Mr. Andrew Lang, has a pretty cover, and 
excellent illustrations by Mr. H. J. Ford. The Japanese 
stories in the book are a new and pleasant element, and 
there are many Sicilian tales and some from the Spanish, 
the Danish, and the French. Mr. Lang draws also upon 
Andersen and the brothers Grimm; and he makes a very 
readable book. 

"The Flame-Flower, and other Stories" (Dent-Lip- 
pincott) is attractive at first glance, because of the orig- 
inality, the humor, and the decorative ingenuity of the 
illustrations. And as the artist, Mr. James F. Sullivan, is 
also the writer, one looks for the same qualities in the 
stories and finds them. Their presence makes the 
strange tales even more interesting to adults than to 
children, but there is much in them also to appeal to 
the latter. Even though it would be difficult to make 
the story of " Bob Robinson's Baby " as clever as its 
illustrations, it will delight them. The parody of Mr. 
H. G. Wells will be funny only to maturer children, per- 
haps, but everyone can appreciate the cleverness of " The 
Lost Idea," if not its delicate satire. " Here They Are!" 
(Longmans), by the same author, is less captivating, but 
no less ingenious. The story of " The Blue Thing with 
White Dots," from Noah's Ark, is particularly funny in 
its description of the wooden Noah's perplexity in re- 
gard to his own identity. And the history of " Snit," the 
mouse, together with the drawings for it, is delightful. 

In " Prince Uno " (Doubleday & McClure), Uncle 
Frank, who is only an ordinary mortal, takes a journey 
into Fairyland. The things he sees there, the people he 



meets, the adventures in which he participates, are de- 
scribed simply and gracefully ; and it is a pleasant, happy, 
gay little place he makes of it. The story was told orig- 
inally to help a small boy through the critical stage of 
an illness, and one follows it with a kind of eager inter- 
est in its power of diverting the invalid. This makes 
one impatient when it drags, and happy when it is gay 
and entertaining. The cover and illustrations, by Mr. 
W. D. Stevens, are daintily pretty. 

The first story in " The Slambangaree and Other 
Stories " (Russell) is literally a nightmare, for it relates 
the experiences of a little boy who ate too much plum- 
pudding and saw strange things in consequence. It is 
written by Mr. R. K. Munkittrick, who has a lively 
fancy and a quaint sense of humor. The other stories 
are much less terrifying, as they have no connection with 
plum-pudding; and they contain a good deal of human 
nature, pleasantly disguised as impossibility. The in- 
genuity of the plots is as extraordinary as the delight- 
fully direct manner in which they are elaborated. " The 
Peasant King " is an artistic tale, but it is not the only 
charming one in the clever little book. 

"The Adventures of Mabel " (Dodd), by Mr. Raf- 
ford Pyke, are chiefly with animals. The green lizard 
gives her a charm with which she can intimidate the 
fiercest wild creature and make him her friend. The 
originality lies in Mabel's oddly familiar intercourse 
with beasts and giants that would make other little 
girls tremble. The pictures by Miss M. E. Norton are 
in broad masses of blacks and white, and have a good 
deal of character. 

Mr. G. E. Farrow, the author of " The Wallypug of 
Why," published last year, is less fortunate in the title 
of this year's book, though anything would seem com- 
monplace after such an inspiration. " The Missing 
Prince" (Dodd) begins with a toy wedding and ends 
with an experiment in flying; and there are all sorts of 
idiosyncracies in between. One of the drollest charac- 
ters is the Advertiser-General, whose original ideas in 
his profession may be commended to those who are in- 
terested. There is plenty of fun, too, in the verses of 
the Public Rhymster; and the entire book shows a large 
fund of ingenuity and humor. The drawings, by Mr. 
Harry Furniss, fully carry out the drollery of the 
story. 

" The Cruikshank Fairy-Book " (Putnam) ought to 
be one of the most popular of the year, for it contains 
four of the good old stories told in the good old way. 
" Puss in Boots," " Jack and the Beanstalk," " Hop-o'- 
my-Thumb," and "Cinderella" are always new; and 
when the fine old Cruikshank illustrations are printed 
with them, they become irresistible. The drawings 
have a delightful amount of action and character, and 
yet they are adroitly kept in harmony with the tales. 
This is much the most important of the year's reprints. 
Two others are Hawthorne's " Tanglewood Tales " 
and " Tales from Hans Andersen " (Crowell), each with 
a colored frontispiece and several illustrations. 

" The Muses up to Date " (Way & Williams), a series 
of whimsical and actable plays for children by Mrs. 
Henrietta Dexter Field and Mr. Roswell Martin Field, 
might also be called a fairy-book. The plays are written 
partly in verse, and are designed to afford many oppor- 
tunities for artistic effects in costuming and grouping. 
Tableaux and dances are frequently introduced, and 
some of the situations would require very dexterous 
management. In the first play the Muses, discontented 
over the neglect of mortals, descend to earth and be-

come desperately modern, too vulgarly modern, in fact. 
The talk is slangy and very ridiculous, but except for 
the originality of the situation, its gay airiness is not 
particularly clever. The other plays are more interest- 
ing. The story of Cinderella is made into a charming 
drama, and later the same story is turned topsy turvy 
in an absurd little way, and our dear lady of the cinders 
made most disagreeable. There are clever things in 
" Trouble in the Garden," which would make a pretty 
series of pictures. The book is well printed and rejoices 
in a charming cover by Mrs. Alice Kellogg Tyler. 

There are two books still which have some connec- 
tion with fairyland. " The Story of the Rhinegold " 
(Harper) is told for young people by Miss Anna Alice 
Chapin. It is Wagner's version which she narrates, and 
she connects it directly with the operas by printing the 
chief musical motifs. The style is good, and though 
the story is a little intricate for very young children, it 
is admirably adapted for the initiation of older ones into 
the Wagnerian mysteries. The cover and illustrations 
have a dignity in keeping with the majesty of the stories. 
"In Indian Tents" (Roberts) contains stories collected 
by Miss Abby L. Alger, from the Penobscot, Passama- 
quoddy, and Micmac Indians. As stories they will in- 
terest children, and as folk-lore they will delight adults. 
They have peculiar quaintness and originality and direct- 
ness. They have even a certain majesty. There is 
something superbly elemental about " The Creation," 
and in all of them we go back to nature and to the 
emotions common to all humanity. 

Many good picture-books will enliven the holiday 
tables this year; and of these, three are musical. " The 
Stevenson Song-Book " (Scribner) is a little outside of 
that category, as it is decorated with pretty convention- 
alized designs in black and white, and a charming cover 
in delicate colors. The poems are selected from the 
" Child's Garden of Verses," and the music is written by 
such well-known composers as Mr. G. W. Chadwick, 
Mr. Arthur Foote, Mr. Reginald de Koven, Mr. W. W. 
Gilchrist, and Dr. C. Villiers Stanford. The simple 
lyrical verses are the most charming things that ever a 
child could sing. 

The late H. C. Bunner's " Three Operettas " (Harper) 
contains gay little musical plays, designed to be acted 
and sung by children. " The Three Little Kittens of 
the Land of Pie " relates ingeniously the adventures of 
those unfortunate pussies who lost their mittens and 
therefore could have no pie. It is bright and amusing 
and would be pretty in action. The plot is absurd, but 
not too absurd to be diverting. And the verses in this, 
as in the others, have a decided swing to them. The little 
songs are gay and catchy. " Bobby Shaftoe " is the 
centre of one of the operettas, and the third weaves an 
ingenious plot around " The Seven Old Ladies of Laven- 
der Town." The music is by Mr. Oscar Weil, and the 
illustrations are drawn by Mr. C. D. Weldon and Mr. 
C. J. Taylor. The cover is strikingly clever. 

" Singing Verses for Children " (Macmillan) is a 
product of Chicago, as the simple pretty verses were 
written by Mrs. Lydia Avery Coonley, the music by Miss 
Eleanor Smith, Miss Jessie L. Gaynor, Mr. Frederic W. 
Root, and Mr. Frank H. Atkinson, Jr. ; and the illustra- 
tions are the work of Mrs. Alice Kellogg Tyler. It 
is easy to see that the entire book is made by lovers 
of children, so gentle and sweet is the conception, so 
tenderly sympathetic the execution. Some of the verses 
are charmingly naive, and the composers have tried to 
maintain the spirit of fresh simplicity. But the most 



delightful thing about the book is Mrs. Tyler's decora- 
tion in color. The pictures are simple, but they are also 
imaginative, and they show an exquisite understanding 
of child life. In addition, they are the work of an 
artist, so that in color and design they are admirable. 
The decorative borders for the music are even lovelier 
than the pictures. The designs for the sunshine, wind, 
and dancing songs, for " My Pegasus " and " Clouds," 
are particularly happy. And there is character in all of 
them, and beauty. 

Mr. Frank Dempster Sherman's " Little-Folk Lyrics " 
(Houghton) are not set to music, though some of them 
sing themselves naturally. The ."Lullaby," with its 
pretty refrain, is exquisitely musical, and others besides 
this have a pleasant lilt and melody. A delicate fancy 
has woven pretty conceits in their meshes, yet they 
rarely have the simplicity and spontaneity necessary to 
an effective appeal to childhood. "The Shadows," 
Wizard Frost," " Clouds," The Dewdrop," and " In 
the Orchard " are the most charming in the imaginative 
freshness of their ideas. The present edition is decor- 
ated with drawings by Misses Maude and Genevieve 
Cowles, which greatly enrich it. They are both original 
and artistic, and have a delightful imaginative grace. 
Some of the drawings, like the fine frontispiece, show a 
rare tenderness. 

The verses in " Red Apple and Silver Bells " (Put- 
nam), by Mr. Hamish Hendry, are more childish; they 
have a more spontaneous naivete. Children might have 
conceived them ; they might almost have written them. 
Yet their conceits are often forced, and sometimes bad 
grammar is made to take the place of inspiration. A bit 
of genuine truth is dropped down into some of them, as 
in the verses called "Friendship"; and others, like 
u White Horses," are richly imaginative. Many of them 
have a lyrical swing, and their ideas are of the kind that 
children like. The illustrations, by Miss Alice B. Wood- 
ward, are thoroughly charming, as fresh and fanciful 
as the poems, and more artistic. 

It is odd to have a book of Eugene Field's come to us 
from England. But the selections for " Lullaby- Land " 
(Scribner) were made by Mr. Kenneth Grahame and 
the pictures by Mr. Charles Robinson. Mr. Grahame 
writes also, in his exquisite imaginative way, an appre- 
ciative preface. The illustrations, except in the case of 
"Little Boy Blue," are also sympathetic. They are charm- 
ing, often decorative, often cleverly pictorial. And the 
diminutive figures which serve as head and tail pieces 
are delightful. The poems themselves are above our 
approbation. They are the real thing, they belong to 
the great company. This poet is one of the few to whom 
Nonsense-Land is true and visible. " As soon as he set 
himself to narrate the goings-on there," says Mr. Gra- 
hame, and no one knows this country better than he, 
" those of us who had been tourists in by-gone days, but 
had lost our return-tickets, pricked up our ears, and 
listened, and remembered, and knew. The Dinkey-Bird, 
we recollected at once, had been singing the day we left, 
in the amf alula- tree; and there, of course, he must have 
been singing ever since, only we had forgotten the way 
to listen. Eugene Field gently reminded us, and the 
Dinkey-Bird was vocal once more, to be silent never 
again." 

Perhaps the most alluring of the picture-books, one 
that will go to the very heart of the children, is " Mother 
Goose in Prose " (Way & Williams), by Mr. L. Frank 
Baum. Here they will find the old familiar favorites 
set forth in new and diverting guise ; here they can f ol-

low the author in weaving strange fancies into the old 
rhymes, or the artist in imagining new figures to fit the 
immortal descriptions. The pictures, by Mr. Maxfield 
Parrisb, are brilliant in their originality, their fitness, 
their expressiveness, and their decorative adjustment of 
lines and masses. They are intensely individual, the 
expression of a peculiar personality ; yet they are adapted 
with sympathetic art to the subject in hand. From a 
decorative standpoint the most successful drawings are 
for Little Boy Blue, the Black Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, 
and Tom the Piper's Son. In these and in some others 
Mr. Parrish artfully leads the imagination down wind- 
ing paths and trailing into fascinating villages and such 
turretted castles as the fancy yearns to play about. In 
this he shows that he understands children and can fol- 
low them to the enchanted lands they love. Some of 
the same comprehension is shown by the author, who 
makes charming stories out of the old lines. He is not 
too definite nor too exact, and he does not prevent the 
child from spinning his own tales. He uses the verses 
merely as a text for delightful little stories, and he 
would be a very practical and stony-hearted child indeed 
who could not enjoy them. 

Several of the picture-books take to poetry this year. 
In " The Vege-Men's Revenge " (Longmans) the verses 
are written by Miss Bertha Upton, and form a non- 
sensical but rather heavy accompaniment to the pictures 
by Miss Florence K. Upton. They are printed in color, 
and give character and varied emotions to a number of 
our commonest and least sensitive vegetables. Potatoes, 
tomatoes, and carrots take on a new interest and excite 
a. new sympathy. The work is therefore cleverly done. 
" The Autobiography of a Monkey " (Russell) tells 
in fluent verse, by Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, the story 
of a beast who passes from the jungle to the hands of 
an organ-grinder and through many subsequent adven- 
tures in the role of a man. He returns at last to the 
jungle to teach his race that " man did not spring from 
the monkey, but monkey descended from man! " The 
pictures, by Mr. Hy. Mayer, are clever and amusing, 
and combine the characters of monkey and man with 
grim adroitness For unadulterated fun one must turn 
to The Bad Child's Book of Beasts " (Arnold), with 
verses by H. B. and pictures by B. T. B. Author and 
artist have happily combined to make a book of de- 
lightful nonsense. One comes upon such unexpected 
rhymes as this: 

" The Whale that wanders round the pole 

Is not a table fish. 
You cannot bake or boil him whole, 

Nor serve him in a dish." 

And the pictures contain as many surprises as the text. 
The amount of character which the artist manages to 
put into the learned fish, the elephant, and even the 
callous hippopotamus will please children of all ages. 
The same authors publish " More Beasts for Worse 
Children " (Arnold), but they make it much less quaintly 
diverting than the smaller book. It has its points 
though, and its surprises. 

A good book of nonsense is as difficult to write as it 
is delightful to read. And Blown Away " (L. C. Page 
& Co.) is a veritable triumph which Mr. Richard Mans- 
field has achieved in a new art. It is pure nonsense, 
absurdly inconsequent nonsense, but it will provoke 
more laughter than any amount of rhyme or reason. 
The author rattles on, jumping in the most surprising 
way from one subject to another, and never for a 
moment losing his hold upon his audience. The book 



is infinite variety, and the variety is infinitely diverting. 
As the author says in his preface, " it relates no story. 
It has no point, policy, or purpose." It is merely fun, 
unadulterated fun, and the man who could read a page 
of it without laughing would be hardened indeed. It is 
the most delicious thing of the kind that has been 
printed since " Alice in Wonderland." The illustrations 
are also delightful, those by Miss Margaret Jones being 
very pretty, and those by the author extremely ludicrous. 
The cover is unfortunately so bad as to be prejudicial 
to the book's success. 

" The Dumpies " (Russell) were discovered by Mr. 
Frank Ver-Beek, and their strange history is now nar- 
rated by Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine. They are very 
short and fat, the Dumpies, and King Dumpling is the 
shortest and fattest of them all ; and all the beasts of the 
field who inhabit their country become like unto them. 
Their history is nonsense, rather prolonged and dry, but 
their pictures are clever and will captivate the little 
people who like little things. Miss Alice B. Woodward 
has illustrated " Adventures in Toyland " (Scribner), by 
Miss Edith King Hall; and the toys become animated 
and emotional without in the least losing their character 
as toys. The drawings are very ingenious, and the 
stories told by a marionette are cleverly contrived to 
show that the lives of these apparently quiet toys are 

really full of exciting incident The story of " The 

Blackberries and their Adventures" (Russell) is told 
and pictured by Mr. E. W. Kemble, who makes his 
amusing pickaninnies indulge in various sports. Miss 
S. Rosamond Praeger is both author and illustrator 
of "The Adventures of the Three Bold Babes" 
(Longmans). It is an absurd little story, which, with 
the aid of its absurd big pictures, may amuse very lit- 
tle people. But it is decidedly a book of an hour only. 
Miss Maud Humphrey's sentimental, over-dressed 
" Little Grown-Ups " (Stokes) will be popular doubt- 
less, as this particular doll-like prettiness finds too ready 
a welcome. The decorative borders, by Miss E. S. 
Tucker, are better, but the text has as little character 
as the colored pictures "A New Baby World " (Century 
Co.) is a collection of stories, rhymes, and pictures for 
little folks, compiled from the pages of " St. Nicholas " 
by Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge. They are of all kinds, 
from gay to pathetic, and any child's mood might be 
satisfied here. The cover is charming in color. 
" Little Hearts " (Routledge) appeals to the same au- 
dience. The verses, by Miss Bertha Upton, are rather 
insipid, but the pictures, by Miss Florence K. Upton, 
have a good deal of character. " Chatterbox " (Estes) 
makes its annual appearance, but both pictures and text 
are pretty far behind the times. The same thing might 
be said of " Sunday Reading for the Young " (Young), 
though some of the pictures here are much better. 

Two nature books are in the children's list. And 
the stories in " Among the Meadow People " (Dutton), 
by Mrs. Clara Dillingham Pierson, are as fascinating 
as fairy-tales. They are fairy-tales, in fact, for the 
insects talk to the flowers of the field and the flowers 
graciously reply. They are prettily told, with the de- 
sign of fixing the habits of these little creatures in the 
child's memory ; and to that end the writer gives them 
life and individuality. The drawings, by Mr. F. C. 
Gordon, help to make this one of the most useful and 
delightful books of the year. "The Plant Baby and 
its Friends" (Silver, Burdett, & Co.), by Mrs. Kate 
Louise Brown, is iu the form of a reader for small 
children. It aims to teach the first principles of botany

in a gay and attractive story-telling manner. But the 
dialogue is often forced and the stories are not imag- 
inative enough. The illustrations are good. 

Fortunately for the girls of the present generation, 
they do not confine themselves to the books ostensibly 
written for them, for if they did we might rear a weak 
and flabby set of women. Of the least of the boys' 
books a certain vigor is required, which raises them 
above inanity. And it is much easier to endure their 
defects than the species of snobbishness and sentiment- 
ality so familiar in the books for girls. There are only 
a few which escape these snags; there are only a few, 
in fact, which try to escape them. But, happily, the 
girl of the present day is fast growing away from such 
reading; her out-of-door games make her too healthy 
in body and mind to care for trash. 

" Three Margarets " (Estes), by Mrs. Laura E. 
Richards, is conceived on a new plan. The Margarets 
are three cousins of the same name, one from the East, 
ne from a ranch in the West, and one from a Cuban 
plantation, who come together for a summer's visit to 
an uncle whom they have never seen. There is here 
an opportunity for contrast in character, which Mrs. 
Richards skilfully, but somewhat melodramatically, im- 
proves. It is on the whole a charming little story, 
with a good deal of human nature in it; but it has not 
the beauty which the author herself achieved in " Cap- 
tain January." The pictures, by Miss Ethelred B. 
Barry, are pretty, though a trifle insipid, and the cover 
is clever. 

Two books by Miss Ellen Douglas Deland appear in 
the holiday list. In spite of its masculine title, " Alan 
Ransford " (Harper) is distinctly of the type called 
feminine. It has more cleverness and virility than 
most of the books of its kind, but a love-story with an 
excess of sentiment in it is not the most healthful read- 
ing for growing girls. For that kind of thing, however, 
it is exceptionally well done " A Successful Venture " 
(W. A. Wilde & Co.) is more sane, but this also is 
marred by premature and ill-timed love-makings. It 
is the story of a family of girls, who, to avoid living 
with an aunt they do not like, start in to make their 
own way in the world. They succeed in spite of dis- 
appointments, and have a good deal of pleasure in the 
process. Miss Deland's style is good, and her dialogue 
is generally free and natural. The pictures, by Mrs. 
Alice Barber Stephens, are excellent. 

The " Ten Little Comedies " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
by Miss Gertrude Smith, author of the " Arabella and 
Aramiuta Stories," are not written in the form of come- 
dies. They are described as " tales of the troubles of 
ten little girls whose tears were turned into smiles"; 
and they are pretty, healthful, graceful little stories of 
the sorrows and joys which are so important in the 
lives of children. There is no eccentricity in them, but 
they have some character and a good deal of human 
nature. The moral tone is excellent, though the lessons 
are not all one way, and the author's heart is obviously 
with the children. The plots have originality, and they 
are handled with a kind of delicate tact. 

There is moral enough and to spare in the story of 
" Miss Nina Barrow " (Century Co.), by Miss Frances 
Conrtenay Baylor. The girl who is its centre and cir- 
cumference is a disagreeable, spoiled, self-willed child, 
who is supposed to be entirely changed by the influence 
of a thoughtful cousin and contact with a well-regulated 
English family where the children are not tyrants. The 
reform is a rather tedious one, and a little difficult to 



believe in. And the moral lectures and good examples 
are too obvious and extended to be interesting to the 
normal girl. 

" Marion Harland " has written an attractive and 
human story of the life of a girl fifty years ago, when 
the schoolmaster had the power to be a master indeed. 
As set forth in " An Old-Field School-Girl " (Scribner), 
Flea's experience with such an instructor is a particularly 
unhappy one. But it is told vigorously and sympatheti- 
cally, and without sentimentality. The girl is very 
much alive, and she has intelligence and spirit, qualities 
in which the characters in girls' books are too often 
conspicuously lacking. There is a charm, too, about the 
Virginia life of the middle-century, and the pictures, 
partly from photographs, help to make it vivid. 

Miss Amanda M. Douglas has been industrious 
enough to write three girls' books this season. The first 
of them, " The Children at Sherburne House " (Dodd), 
continues the series familiar to her readers. The story 
is very mature, and ends, in the approved fashion, with 
wedding-bells. The girl who is old enough to read it is 

old enough to read something much better Upon 

" Her Place in the World " (Lee & Shepard), it is neces- 
sary to make the same comment, for the sort of love- 
making it contains is not particularly edifying " Han- 
nah Ann " (Dodd) is a sequel to " A Little Girl in Old 
New York" and begins in 1846. Its subject therefore 
has an interest of its own in the contrast in manners 
and customs. Miss Douglas's style is flexible, and her 
stories are sweet and unaffected. 

In reading " Miss Mouse and her Boys " (Macmillan), 
one can understand the perennial charm which Mrs. 
Molesworth has for the young, and rejoice that it is a 
wholesome one. Her gentleness, her sympathy, her 
real knowledge of child-life, are all in evidence, and 
there is quiet forcefulness in the book which is pleasant 
to encounter. The illustrations, by Miss L. Leslie 
Brooke, are clever. The charm is much less evident 
in this author's book for older girls, " Meg Langholme " 
(Lippincott). Here the style grows stilted and takes 
on the faults which young women are supposed to ad- 
mire. Still, there is heartiness in the descriptions, and 
a certain vigor in the exciting but unnatural situations. 

Miss Yonge's girls' book for the season is called 
" Founded on Paper " (Thomas Whittaker), and begins 
with one of Queen Victoria's jubilees, and ends with 
the other. It contains a little excitement and a good 
deal of preaching, which would be more effective if it 
were more condensed. It is a rather goody-goody little 
book, but Miss Yonge's admirers know what to expect. 

Mrs. Champney's " Witch Winnie in Venice " (Dodd) 
is quite different from her charming story of " Pierre 
and his Poodle." It is too instructive to be artistic, 
but it contains a large amount of information put up in 
sugar. Mrs. Champney writes briskly and well, and she 
mixes history and biography and romance in a bright and 
effective way. Many photographs illustrate the book. 

Miss Evelyn Raymond presents a study of country 
schools and country boys and girls in " The Little Red 
Schoolhouse " (Roberts) . She has done it cleverly, too, 
and has given an interesting picture of school-boy pranks 
and failures and successes. And there is a touch of 
school-boy devotion and self-sacrifice and heroism. The 
points are occasionally strained, but they have some 
human nature in them, nevertheless. The pictures are 
wooden. 

It is hardly possible to do much more than enumerate 
the remaining girls' books upon our table. " Sue Orcutt "

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



cutt" (Wilde), by Mrs. Charlotte M. Vaile, is a sequel 
to " The Orcutt Girls." It carries Sue on through the 
training she had so ardently desired, and shows how, 
after the academy was left behind, she worked her way 
through college. " Queer Janet " (Lee & Shepard) 
has for its heroine a girl who has the commoner fault 
(in books) of being too good. Miss Grace Le Baron is 

the author " Rich Enough " (Roberts), by Miss Leigh 

Webster, is a story for older girls. Its theme is found 
in the removal to the country of a family which is too 
poor to maintain its social position in town. The change 
proves fortunate, and everything winds up in happiness. 
In " Wanolasset, The Little-One- Who-Laughs " 
(Roberts), Miss A. G. Plympton goes back to Puritan 
days. The story has a sweet and gentle flavor; it is 
prettily written, and prettily illustrated by the author. 
"A Girl's Ordeal" (Coates), by Mrs. Lucy C. Lillie, 
is of the nature of a novel, and much too sensational for 
either young or old The " Hearthstone Series " (Lee 
& Shepard) contains a story by Miss Sophie May called 
" The Campion Diamonds," and one by Ellen H. Cooley 
called " The Boom of a Western City." Miss Martha 
Finlay continues the " Elsie books " (Dodd) with " Elsie 
At Home"; and "Penn Shirley" adds "The Happy 
Six" to the "Silver Gate Series" (Lee & Shepard). 
" Three Pretty Maids " (Lippincott), by Miss Amy E. 
Blanchard, contains some good illustrations by Alice 
Barber Stephens. " A Lonely Little Lady" (Dodd), by 
Miss Dolf Wyllarde, is also enriched with clever draw- 
ings. But in addition it is enriched too much with fine 

feathers and love-making to be wholesome Miss E. 

Everett-Green makes a contribution to girls' literature 
in " Sister " (Nelson). This too is rather sentimental 

for young readers, and rather old and complicated A 

pretty, graceful tale, with a bit of the negro element 
in it, is "Little Homespun" (Stokes), by Ruth Ogden 
(Mrs. Charles W. Ide). It is a sequel to "Courage," 
which has already achieved some popularity. " A Dear 
Little Girl" (Jacobs), written and illustrated by Miss 
Amy E. Blanchard, is a pleasant little story for pleasant 
little girls. 

We hail it as a healthy sign that so many popular 
books on outdoor subjects are now appearing. Certainly 
one of the best of these is "Wild Neighbors " (Macmillan), 
by the well-known writer, Ernest Ingersoll. This 
book consists of very pleasantly written sketches of such 
common American mammals as the woodchuck, porcu- 
pine, raccoon, gray squirrel, and skunk, and also chap- 
ters on the puma, the coyote, the badger, and on animal 
intelligence. The homelier the theme, the happier seems 
to be the author's vein ; and the masterpiece of the vol- 
ume is the chapter entitled " The Skunk Calmly Con- 
sidered," which is an extremely pleasant and interesting 
account of that mephitic being. While his work is 
mainly a skilful compilation from such writers as 
Thoreau, Burroughs, Abbott, and others, Mr. Ingersoll 
yet records many of his own observations and conclusions. 
Some of these latter the reader may well question, as 
that the gray squirrel smells nuts hidden under several 
feet of snow. The illustrations in this book are not well 
selected nor of a high order of merit. The numerous 
pictures of bones have little meaning in a work of this 
kind. But the volume as a whole is a capital one for 
boys, and for all of larger growth who have or should 
have a real interest in animals. 

Several historical books must be added to the long 
list given in our last number. Miss Beatrice Harraden 
contributes one called " Untold Tales of the Past " 



(Dodd). They are slight, forgotten episodes which she 
describes and elaborates. She does it prettily but with 
a certain air of condescension, writing down unnecessa- 
rily to the children's level. Joan of Arc, Caxton, Csesar, 
and Phidias are some of the heroes who form the centres 
of these stories, which show them always iu contact 
with the young. There is a tendency to sentimentality 
in the author's method. The drawings by Mr. H. R. 
Millar are variable, but some of them are excellent. 
"The King's Story Book" (Longmans) is constructed 
after an entirely new pattern by Mr. George Laurence 
Gomme. It contains a series of historical studies deal- 
ing with English kings from the Conquest to the reign 
of William IV.; but these are extracted entirely from 
romantic literature. Shakespeare furnishes the accounts 
of John, Henry IV., Prince Hal, and Edward V.; Sir 
Walter Scott those of Henry II., Richard of the Lion 
Heart, Edward I., James I., Charles I., and the Com- 
monwealth; Thackeray supplies those of Anne and 
George IV.; Dickens that of George III.; and Lord 
Lytton, Charlotte Bront^, and Leigh Hunt are among 
the others drawn upon. It will readily be seen that the 
book is readable for young and old. The drawings by 
Harrison Miller are only tolerable. The title of " An 
Emperor's Doom " (Nelson), by Mr. Herbert Hayens, 
refers to Maximilian of Mexico. His is a tragic story, 
but well worth the telling, and the book gives one some 
idea of the mistakes that were made and the pitif ulness 
of it all. The author's style is good, and the story 
moves swiftly and excitedly. The cover and illustra- 
tions are excellent. The same author is responsible for 
" Soldiers of the Legion " (Nelson). This too is a 
story of conspiracy and war, but the scene is changed to 
Spain, and the Carlists are the principal actors. There 
is a briskness about Mr. Hayens's style which will appeal 

to boys Mrs. E. Everett-Green writes of " A Clerk of 

Oxford " (Nelson) and tells of his adventures in the 
Barons' War. The archaic English of the dialogue is 
rather forced, and the style throughout the book a little 
heavy, so that the long and complicated story is not 
carried off with spirit. 

America is treated bountifully this year, as several 
additional books will testify. " The Exploits of Myles 
Standish" (Appleton) are narrated by Mr. Henry 
Johnson (Muirhead Robertson). His material for the 
first thirty-six years is avowedly imaginary, but after 
the Mayflower set sail the story is based upon the records. 
It is vigorously told, but the author cannot make his 
characters live. And the description of the famous 
Staudish courtship is stiff and unconvincing. The same 
period, picturesque in contrasts, in character and cour- 
age, is treated in " On Plymouth Rock " (Lee & 
Shepard), by Mr. Samuel Adams Drake. His is a sim- 
ple, straightforward account, written primarily for 
schools, of the manners and customs of the early Puri- 
tans. The style is good and the little book is interest- 
ing and valuable. The Revolution, however, is still in 
the lead, for the most charming of these books is " An 
Unwilling Maid" (Houghton), in which Miss Jeanie 
Gould Lincoln tells a graceful story in a graceful way. 
There is something refreshingly attractive about the 
book, and the characters have individuality and charm. 
Betty is human and alive, and her little sister Moppet 

is a true child and delightful Dr. Everett T. Tomlinson 

contributes another book to the story of 1812. The 
scene of action in "Guarding the Border" (Lee & 
Shepard) is largely the Great Lakes, and the author 
gives an idea of the task of building a navy and learn- 



1897.] 



THE DIAL

ing to make it effective. General Scott makes an ap- 
pearance in this book. Mr. James Barnes also makes 
another contribution to the history of this war in " Yan- 
kee Ships and Yankee Sailors " (Macmillan). Mr. 
Barnes's style is admirable, and the stories he has taken 
from history and tradition are stirring narratives of 
valiant deeds. Many of them are of the kind which 
the new navy and the new system of warfare have made 
impossible, and it is well to preserve thus the memory 
of them to our boys and girls. The illustrations by 
Zogbaum and Chapman are excellent. Mrs. Molly 
Elliot Seawell also deals with the water in " Twelve 
Naval Captains " (Scribner). Her style is more care- 
less than were her investigations, for she gives accurate 
and interesting biographies of the most important of our 
early commanders. The book is illustrated with repro- 
ductions of old portraits. 

In taking up " The Vanished Yacht " (Nelson), one 
leaves the region of history, but remains with the sea. 
*Mr. E. Harcourt Burrage has written a spirited and 
exciting tale with a most unusual plot, and he makes the 
extraordinary incidents seem real. Its theme is the 
chase of a yacht stolen by a Spanish adventurer, and 
its capture after many difficulties are surmounted. The 
illustrations are good, and the style of the narrative is 

well calculated to sustain interest " The Island of 

Gold " (Nelson) is another " sailor's yarn," written this 
time by Dr. Gordon Stables of the Royal Navy. It des- 
cribes many dangers, but always some miraculous release 
from them. The improbabilities are rather too numer- 
ous even for a boy's insatiable appetite, and the men 
and women who figure in them have no independent life. 
A few good illustrations are by Allan Stewart. Mr. 
S. R. Crockett appears as the narrator of " The Surpris- 
ing Adventures of Sir Toady Lion " (Stokes), and de- 
scribes it as " an improving history for old boys, young 
boys, good boys, bad boys, big boys, little boys, cow-boys, 
and torn-boys." The story is charming, thoroughly 
fresh and childish and natural, and enlivened with 
a whimsical, delightful humor. There is a bit of 
sentiment in it, but it is not unwholesome sentiment. 
Mr. Gordon Browne's pictures are a fit accompaniment, 
for they have character, too. " The Enchanted Burro " 
(Way & Williams) and " The King of the Broncos " 
(Scribner), both by Mr. Charles F. Lummis, are not ex- 
clusively books for boys, yet they will derive much instruc- 
tion and entertainment from them. They contain stories 
of New Mexico and South America, countries too little 
known to our youth, written by a man who is familiar 
with every foot of the ground. His style, too, pictur- 
esquely suits his subject, and reveals some of the charm 
of the Spanish and Indian mixture of races. There are 
rather too many Spanish phrases, with superfluous expla- 
nations of them in the notes, but it is not these which 
gives us the spirit of this strange civilization. In the 
first-mentioned book the pictures by Charles Abel Corwin 
are capital, and the very original cover suggests the 
mystery of the Southwestern plains. 

It should be possible to satisfy the most exacting 
child from this long list, for though the struggle for 
novelty is often too evident and many fall by the way- 
side, some of these writers understand their world and 
can adjust the desirable to the acceptable. Their books 
will last longer than the season, for children are quick 
to know their friends; but one wonders where the bad 
books go to, whether there is a special heaven and 
hell for the hundreds of volumes that die before the 
year is out. 



LITERARY NOTES. 

Mr. W. R. Jenkins has just published " A Brief 
Italian Grammar with Exercises," the work of Dr. 
Hjalmar Edgren, favorably known as the author of 
elementary French and Spanish grammars. 

The tenth annual meeting of the American Economic 
Association will be held December 29-31, at Cleveland, 
Ohio. Professors F. H. Giddings, Carroll D. Wright, 
Arthur T. Hadley, Richmond Mayo-Smith, F. W. Taus- 
sig, and J. L. Laughlin, and Secretary Gage are among 
the speakers announced. 

Mrs. Alice Wellington Rollins, a member of the little 
colony of artists and literary folk who live in Lawrence 
Park, Bronxville, a few miles out of New York, died on 
the fifth of this month. She was born in Boston about 
fifty years ago, and was well known as a writer of poetry, 
criticism, and sketches of travel. 

We have received the first numbers of " L'Echo de la 
Semaine," a weekly " revue litte'raire et mondaine " 
published in Boston. It is an eight-page sheet, agree- 
ably diversified in contents, and promises, among other 
things, to reprint M. Brunetiere's impressions of America 
au fur et a mesure qu'elles paralront, 

The Central Division of the Modern Language Asso- 
ciation of America will hold its third annual meeting at 
the Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, the 
last two days of this year and the first of the next. 
Papers are announced by many well-known philologists, 
among them being Professors D. K. Dodge, Julius 
Goebel, C. F. McClumpha, J. E. Matzke, Georg Hempl, 
J. T. Hatfield, and Ewald Fluegel. 

Messrs. Scott, Foresman & Co. are the publishers of 
" Principles of Vocal Expression," by Messrs. W. B. 
Chamberlain and S. H. Clark. It is a practical treatise, 
the outcome of classroom work, upon " the rhetoric of 
vocal expression " and " mental technique and literary 
interpretation." The same publishers send us Dr. W. L. 
Burdick's " Topical Outlines of Roman History," a 
small book for preparatory students. 

A proposition to levy tribute upon authors and pub- 
lishers for the benefit of libraries wouliseem too absurd 
to be treated seriously, and yet we are advised that a 
bill for this purpose is actually to be introduced into the 
Senate of the United States, the doubtful honor falling 
to Senator Perkins of California, in which State the 
movement appears to have originated. By this bill, 
four copies of " the best edition " of every copyright 
book published in the United States (in addition to the 
two copies required to be sent to the Librarian of Con- 
gress) are to be distributed among certain libraries 
designated, at San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and 
New Orleans. Publishers of " every subsequent edition " 
having " any substantial changes " are to be similarly 
mulcted. It is urged, by the Committee of California 
Librarians having the plan in charge, that " there is a 
widespread feeling that copies of copyrighted works 
should be available, so far as possible, for general 
reference," and that this applies especially to residents 
of the Pacific Coast. But why not buy the books that 
are so much to be desired ? Or, if they can be got 
without buying, simply by Act of Congress, why limit 
the number of involuntary donations to four copies ? 
Why not make it fourteen, or forty, copies, and thus 
extend the benefits of the act to other deserving regions 
where there is a widespread feeling that books " should 
be available for general reference " ?

Two Beautiful Gift Books. 

THROUGH THE INVISIBLE. 

A Love Story. 
By PAUL TYNER. 

WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY ELLA F. PELL. 

In a simple story of love in springtime; the author 
pictures the awakening of soul in a man of the world. 
The story is dramatic in action and setting, while the 
characters are intensely real and modern. Miss Pell's 
pictures for Sir Edwin Arnold's " Song Celestial " won 
wide recognition for her talent. In the present story, 
the underlying thought and spirit find artistic interpre- 
tation at her hands. 

16tno, cloth, gilt top, pp. 196 ; price, 75 cents. 

THE LIVING CHRIST: 

*AN EXPOSITION OF THE IMMORTALITY OF MAN IN 
SOUL AND BODY. 

By PAUL TYNER. 

This work is designed to show that the perpetuation 

of life in ever-increasing strength, fulness, and beauty 

of manifestation is entirely within the powers of man. 

Much new light is shed on the problem of Christ's resur- 

rection, and the book has special and vital interest for all 

religious teachers, physicians, and students of sociology.

CULTURED PEOPLE 

Who are particular as to the class of reading 
matter that goes into their homes, and realize 
the importance of admitting only such publica- 
tions as maintain a high standard and elevated 
tone, are invited to try for 1898 the three pub- 
lications which, in a city where commercial and 
material affairs have long held sway, are working 
in the interests of higher intelligence and culture, 
and have won a position in their respective fields 
second to none in America. These papers are : 

THE CHICAGO EVENING POST. 

" THE CHICAGO EVENING POST bears the same rela- 
tion to the Chicago press that The New York Evening 
Post bears to the press of that city that is to say, it 
is a daily paper of the highest class, and appeals for its 
constituency to the best classes of people, and is there- 
fore free from sensationalism and from any pandering 
to ignorance, prejudice, or vice." The Interior, Chicago. 

THE CHAP=BOOK. 

" Chicago's handsome CHAP-BOOK . . . has estab- 
lished itself as the most amusing, the most readable, of 
American literary periodicals. . . . THE CHAP-BOOK 
is to be congratulated on the intelligence, the freedom 
from prejudice, which marks its literary judgments, and 
on the fact that it can hold itself uninfluenced even before 
the greatest names in fiction." Kansas City Star. 

THE DIAL. 

" THE DIAL is the best and ablest literary paper in 
the country." John G. Whittier. 

" From every point of view, THE DIAL is unsurpassed 
by any other literary journal in England or America." 
Sir Walter Besant. 

To put these three papers within the reach 
of all who appreciate the desirability of seeing 
them regularly, the publishers have arranged

A HINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS. 



FOR THE PRESENT HOLIDAY SEASON, Book lovers have the chance to 
procure for gift purposes such a literary treasure as was never before seen. To Mr. Charles 
Dudley Warner, as its editor-in-chief, belongs the palm of victory for this achievement in book 
production. The " Library of the World's Best Literature," as it has been happily named, 
might also fitly be termed the world's crowning effort in the creation of books. 

Either praise or minute description of this magnificent work would seem almost needless 
to a public that has read its eulogy, since the appearance of the very first volume, in all the 
chief literary periodicals of the country. Just here may be noted briefly the principal features 
that constitute the Library a work of surpassing excellence for profit and enjoyment : 

CRITICAL ESSAYS. About a thousand graphic essays, by living scholars and 
writers of eminence, furnish in popular style their critical, interpretative, biographical, and 
historical comments on the world's great authors and their principal works, alike of ancient and 
modern times. In every one of these the critic is also a specialist in relation to his subject. 

SELECTED LITERATURE. Following the interpretative studies are presented 
the master productions of the most famous writers of all ages and countries. The collection 
includes Poetry, History, Romance, Oratory, Biography, Science and Philosophy, Theology, 
Letters, Drama, Wit and Humor, and every other form of literary expression. 

HISTORY OF LITERATURE. The Library contains histories of all the world's 
literatures, ancient and modern, written in each case by a specialist who is recognized as author- 
ity on the subject. The sacred books of the nations also form special studies. 

SYNOPSIS OF BEST BOOKS. Three thousand of the world's best books are 
separately analyzed and given in clear synopsis of narrative, plot, and characters. Refreshes 
our past reading and guides to that of the future. 

BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY. The most complete and accurate dictionary of 
the lives of great authors ever made. It embraces 12,000 names and gives under each all 
essential facts and literary successes. 

INDEX. The most elaborate and careful ever yet compiled for a work of magnitude. 
It indexes by reference and cross-reference every name, event, book, selection, topic and senti- 
ment treated of on any page of the Library. An immense boon to literary workers. Such 
are the chief features that distinguish the "Library of the World's Best Literature." But 
they are not all. There are others that serve to make it as helpful to the student and scholar 
as it is bright and entertaining for mere intellectual recreation. 



Not for those of next year or the years to follow, can the LIBRARY be obtained at the excep- 
tionally low price now made available through the Harper's Weekly Club. This was only 
established as an introductory figure to enable the public to learn the merits and value of the 
work. THE PRICE is TO BE ADVANCED AFTER NEW YEAR'S DAY. None should miss the 
present opportunity to secure full particulars under the exceptionally advantageous offer made 
for the month of December to all who become members of the Harper's Weekly Club.

THE STORY OF AB 

A Tale of the Time of the Cave Man. 

By STANLEY WATERLOO, author of A Man and 

a Woman," " An Odd Situation," etc. 

In appearance one of the most striking and attractive 
of the year, printed on the best paper, with a cover by 
Bradley, the well-known designer. The work itself is 
one of the most fascinating and popular novels, illus- 
trating faithfully the life of the ancient men who were 
our own ancestors. A story of wild adventure, love, 
and war when men lived in caves, defended them- 
selves against each other, and against the monster wild 
beasts of the time. It is published simultaneously here 
and in England, and is the book of the present season. 

The book cannot fail to be read with absorbing interest, 
and no such representation of prehistoric life, so far as I know, 
has ever been given in any language. President C. K. 
ADAMS, University of Wisconsin, and Ex-President of Cornell 
University. 

The book will be one of the classics of this country, and 
will give its author high rank among American scholars. 
Professor RASMUS B. ANDERSON. 

What Ebers's novels have done to familiarize readers with 
the life and history of the Ancient Egyptians, " The Story of 
Ab" will do for prehistoric man. FRED H. HILD, Esq., 
Librarian, Chicago Public Library.
