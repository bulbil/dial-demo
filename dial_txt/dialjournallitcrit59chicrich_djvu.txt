Edited with an Introduction 

By G. A. JOHNSTON. M. A., University of Glasgow 
Pp. 268, cloth; price $1.25 

The historical significance of the Philosophy of Common 
Sense is considerable. 

For half a century the Philosophy of Common Sense 
was the dominant philosophy in American universities; and 
it is to the Scottish president of an American college (James 
McCosh of Princeton) that we owe the most comprehensive 
study of it. 

In England and Germany it has never been much 
appreciated, but in France it exercised a great influence 
through Victor Cousin (1792-1867), who made it the 
greatest power in French philosophy of the period. In 
recent years, in France, there has been a recrudescence of 
interest in the Scottish philosophy through the writings of 
Professor T. T. Laurie, who attempted, in several able 
works, a critical reconstruction of the traditional Scottish 
Natural Realism. 

The Scottish Philosophy of Common Sense originated 
as a protest against the skeptical conclusions of Hume, and 
the hypotheses found in Locke and Descartes. Thomas 
Reid was the first man to see clearly the genesis of Hume's 
skepticism, and in this little volume he gives an admirable 
account of his investigations of the principles upon which 
this skeptical system was built.

OPINIONS OF EARLY REVIEWERS: 



-N. Y. Times: 



"No one can afford to miss 
reading 'A Far Country,' or 

reading it, can fail to be in- 
terested. The themes Mr. 
Churchill handles are the big 
themes confronting all America, 
and in the fortunes and mis- 
fortunes of his characters he in- 
dicates energies and develop- 
ments that are nation-wide. It 
touches on what is vital . . 
and it will help in no small degree 
to broaden our thpught and 
clarify our vision. Many people 
read ' The Inside of the Cup, ' but 
'A Far Country* should reach 
a wider audience." 



-Boston Globe:- 



"A powerfully written story, 
displaying wonderful scope and 
clarity of vision. Presents a 
wonderful study of American 
emotions and character analy- 
sis. " 

N. Y. World: 

"A story worthily complete 
vastly encouraging. 
The kind of a book that points 
to a hope and a right road." 

Chicago Post: 

"Mr. Churchill has done 
a difficult thing well. 
We congratulate him on an- 
achievement well worthwhile." 



Chicago Herald:- 



"A great piece of art, com- 
prising admirable humanization, 
plot, and sympathy, diverse as 
intrinsic . . . and many 
interesting side issues. Any 
author might well be proud of 
such achievement. " 

Chicago Tribune: 
" 4 A Far Country' is an 

American novel in all that that 
term implies. " 

Philadelphia Ledger : 

" 'A Far Country' is a strong 
story that is vital and com- 
pelling. . . . Adds one 
more leaf to Mr. Churchill's 
literary laurels."

THE PITY OF IT! 



The passion aroused in the German breast 
last August, when it became evident that En- 
gland, the old-time champion of the menaced 
liberties of Europe, had no intention of evad- 
ing its honorable obligations toward Belgium 
and France, and viewed treaties as being dis- 
tinctly something more than scraps of paper, 
was characterized by a peculiar form of petu- 
lance. We read with sorrowful amusement of 
the Kaiser's actions in casting off the various 
honorary distinctions bestowed upon him in 
happier times by the English government, and 
in thus reducing to a considerable extent the 
number of costumes in his wardrobe. A more 
serious matter was offered by the many Ger- 
man scholars who forthwith disclaimed any 
further membership in the scientific and lit- 
erary associations of the enemy nations, and 
flung back upon the donors their medals and 
degrees and official titles. While this act, also, 
was so childish as to be amusing, it had besides 
a very serious and ominous aspect, for it be- 
tokened a rupture in the intellectual common- 
wealth that was bound to work much mischief 
long after the warring peoples should have 
come to terms upon the battlefield. To many 
of us, this was the most harrowing thought of 
the war the thought that the world's comity 
of intercourse in things spiritual, the strongest 
bond of brotherhood that civilization has estab- 
lished among men, was likely to be shattered as 
regarded the nation to which the rest of the 
world is in so many fields of achievement so 
heavily indebted. The thought weighed intol- 
erably upon those whom culture had broad- 
ened to world-mindedness, and who were 
brought by it to a more poignant sense of the 
meaning of warfare than is possible to the 
homme sensuel moyen who eggs on the com- 
batants from narrow motives of pelf or mis- 
guided patriotism. 

The thing was not without precedent. We 
recall the similar amenities which were a by- 
product of the Franco-Prussian War. We 
recall, for example, the case of Pasteur, who 
returned his diploma to the University of 
Bonn, saying : " Now the sight of that parch- 
ment is odious to me, and I feel offended at

seeing my name, with the qualification of 
Virum clarissimum that you have given it, 
placed under a name which is henceforth an 
object of execration to my country, that of 
Rex Gulielmus." The counter was neat and 
emphatic : " The undersigned, now Principal 
of the Faculty of Medicine at Bonn, is re- 
quested to answer the insult which you have 
dared to offer to the German nation in the 
sacred person of its august Emperor, King 
Wilhelm of Prussia, by sending you the expres- 
sion of its entire contempt. P. S. Desiring 
to keep its papers free from taint, the Faculty 
herewith returns your screed." 

It was Renan, however, rather than Pas- 
teur, who carried off the honors in these 
exchanges of diplomatic notes between the 
great powers of European scholarship. His 
correspondence with D. F. Strauss offers a 
masterpiece of the delicate and deadly satire, 
or caustic irony, which no stylist but a French- 
man could possibly have at his command. 
Commenting, nearly a year later, upon the fact 
that Strauss had published the correspondence 
in a pamphlet, Renan said : 

" It is true that you have done me an honor which 
I am bound to appreciate. You yourself have 
translated my reply and included it with your two 
letters in a pamphlet. You have had this pamphlet 
sold for the benefit of an establishment for wounded 
German soldiers. God forbid that I should quibble 
upon a point of literary property ! The charity to 
which you have made me contribute is a work of 
humanity, and if my feeble prose has been instru- 
mental in bestowing a few cigars upon the men who 
looted my little house at Sevres, I thank you for 
having given me the opportunity to conform my 
conduct with certain of the principles of Jesus that 
I believe to be the most authentic. But I must call 
your attention to a delicate distinction. Assuredly, 
if you had permitted me to publish one of your 
writings, it would never have occurred to me, never 
in the world, to do it for the benefit of our Hotel 
des Invalides." 

How profoundly Kenan's nature was stirred 
by the Franco-Prussian War, and how poig- 
nantly he felt the disruption of intellectual 
comity that it inevitably entailed, may be seen 
on many a page of his " Reforme Intellectuelle 
et Morale," from which the above passage has 
been translated. This is indeed a volume for 
the present times, replete with wisdom, and 
infused w r ith the noblest of feeling. We read 
in the preface : 

" It had been the dream of my life to labor, to 
the extent of my feeble powers, for the intellectual, 
moral, and political alliance of France with Ger- 
many, an alliance that should bring England in its 



train, and constitute a force capable of ruling the 
world, directing it in the ways of liberal civilization, 
equally apart from the naively blind impulses of 
democracy and from the puerile velleities that 
would have it retrace its steps toward a past that is 
definitely dead. My dream, I admit, is destroyed 
forever. An abyss is dug between France and Ger- 
many; centuries will not avail to fill it. The vio- 
lence done to Alsace and Lorraine will long remain 
a gaping wound ; the guaranties of peace dreamed 
by German journalists and statesmen will be guar- 
anties of wars without end. . . What we loved in 
Germany, its breadth of view, its lofty conception 
of humanity, exists no longer. Germany is now 
nothing more than a nation; she is at present the 
most powerful of nations ; but we know how endur- 
ing are these hegemonies and what they leave 
behind them." 

At the close of Kenan's correspondence with 
Strauss comes this melancholy refrain : 

" France is about to say with your Herwegh : 
' Enough of that sort of love ; let us try hatred for 
a change.' I shall not follow her in this new course, 
the success of which may be doubted. France holds 
to a resolve of hatred less than to any other. In 
any case, life is too short for it to be wise to waste 
time and dissipate energy in so wretched a sport. 
I have toiled in my humble sphere to bring about 
friendship between France and Germany; if now 
the ' time to refrain from embracing ' has come, as 
the Preacher says, I will withdraw. I will not 
counsel hatred after having counselled love; I will 
keep silent." 

How closely all these old matters are par- 
alleled in the present tragic hour is apparent 
to every reader of the history that is now being 
made from day to day. The correspondence 
between Strauss and Renan finds its counter- 
part in the letters exchanged last autumn 
between Herr Gerhart Hauptmann and M. 
Romain Rolland. The petulant attitude of 
German scholarship is once more illustrated by 
Professor Kuno Meyer, who has recently taken 
such offence at some poor verses of anti- 
German tenor contributed by an undergradu- 
ate to the " Harvard Advocate " that he has 
held the University responsible for the " vile 
poem," and indignantly repudiated the plan 
to make him an " exchange professor " in that 
institution for the coming year. His screed 
addressed to President Lowell speaks of " this 
gratuitous and shameful insult to the honor 
and fair fame of a friendly nation," declares 
Harvard and its President to be " branded 
before the world and posterity as abettors of 
international animosity, as traitors to the 
sacred cause of humanity," expresses the hope 
that " no German will again be found to accept 
the post of exchange professor at Harvard," 
and voices his regret that he himself was ever

THE DIAL 



induced " to set foot in the defiled precincts of 
a once noble university." And the occasion for 
this outpouring of emotion is nothing more 
than the fact that an irresponsible student, in 
a publication entirely controlled by students, 
has written in a sense antagonistic to the Ger- 
man cause ! Hinc illce lachrymcc. Was there 
ever so amazing an exhibition of childishness 
on the part of a man supposed to stand for 
light and leading ! 

Such matters are symptomatic of a breach 
which is not so much a rift within the lute as 
an unbridgeable abyss and the gulf has been, 
if possible, widened by the attitude of the Ger- 
man nation toward the "Lusitania" crime, 
frankly adopting and defending the Black 
Hand method of warfare, and openly exulting 
in its ghastly outcome. The intensity of the 
feeling engendered between Germany and the 
powers she has made her foes finds so many 
illustrations that it is disheartening to think 
of the legacy which her aggression will be- 
queath to the coming generation. What hope 
can there be of a resumption of friendly rela- 
tions either in the political or the intellectual 
sphere when such a man as Professor von Ley- 
den of Berlin can utter such sentiments as 
these : 

" No self-respecting German will ever consent to 
remain in any room of which an Englishman is the 
occupant. If the German can not eject the English- 
man he will himself leave the room. We can not be 
expected to breathe the same polluted air as our 
deadliest foes, who fell upon us from the rear and 
in the dark. There can be no compromise on this 
point. We have to swear a national vendetta 
against the English never to rest, never to cease our 
preparations for another war, never to spare an 
effort until the last semblance of English power is 
destroyed, and there will be no rest or repose for 
any honest German till the British Empire has been 
swept into the oblivion of past history." 

The virulence of hatred found in 'this utter- 
ance and in the famous Hassgesang is typical 
of the German attitude in its present aberra- 
tion. While opinion in the opposing camps 
does not go to such extremes, it is nevertheless 
determined on the question of future relations 
with the enemy. The French attitude is re- 
ported by Mr. Stoddard Dewey, who knows the 
contemporary French mind in all its workings, 
in the following words: "Whatever may be 
the terms which France will have to accept or 
which will be imposed on Germany, all human 
relations of Frenchmen with Germans have 
ceased indefinitely. . . Every French con- 
sciousness, erroneously or not, is filled with 



too keen a sense of intolerable wrong for 
human intercourse until Time the Healer has 
passed." 

Viewed sub specie ceternitatis } this is clearly 
an impossible situation, but it is one that will 
prolong the tragedy of the present clash of 
arms long beyond the date of the formal treaty 
of peace. It will take many years to bind up 
these wounds, and bring either of the com- 
batants to the standpoint of "malice toward 
none and charity for all." But the intellec- 
tual severance, we feel assured, cannot last 
forever ; to believe that it will so last is to take 
counsel of despair and to reject utterly the 
unifying ministry of idealism to the over- 
wrought mind. Perplexed in the extreme 
though the issue now be, the future, if far dis- 
tant, must bring a return to acceptance of the 
faith that in matters of the spirit all the races 
of mankind have a commonwealth of which the 
franchise is offered to every sincere seeker 
after goodness and truth and beauty. Every 
indication of a return to the sanity of outlook 
in this vitally important matter should be re- 
ceived with generous hospitality as a welcome 
harbinger of the reconciliation that the future 
must bring as an atonement for the distraught 
present. Some such indications are already at 
hand, significantly from German sources, and 
we trust that they may be multiplied before 
too grievous a period of estrangement shall 
have intervened. It is the socialist deputy 
Herr Haenisch from whom these hopeful 
words come: " There has been some talk that 
in future German science and art must lead 
their own life and that foreign scientific work 
should not be reviewed in German periodicals. 
This is sheer rubbish. After the war the 
nations will be still more dependent upon one 
another than before, and without the fructify- 
ing influence of foreign countries our national 
culture will wither." And it is the "Frank- 
furter Zeitung" which asks editorially: 
" What sense is there in German professors de- 
claring that they will no longer collaborate 
with this or that scientific institution in En- 
gland ? Science and art have always appeared 
as the common possession of civilized peoples, 
and does not one injure one's own people and its 
science by sitting on the stool of isolation and 
by breaking off scientific intercourse? " Such 
utterances as these show that the seed is al- 
ready being sown of a future comity which it 
should be the sacred mission of every lover of 
mankind to further in its growth.

THE DIAL 



[ June 24 



In April of last year, the German Shake- 
speare Society celebrated at Weimar the birth- 
day of the poet. It was an international 
gathering, with guests from many countries, 
England, France, and Belgium being among 
those represented. The delegates came to- 
gether in the best of good fellowship, joined by 
the common bond of reverence for Shake- 
speare's genius. They parted in joyous antici- 
pation of their next reunion, appointed for 
1916 in the town of Stratford, for the tercen- 
tenary of Shakespeare's death. How that 
dream was shattered a few weeks later we all 
know. But that dream stood for an ideal too 
precious to be abandoned the ideal of an 
intellectual community of interest that rises 
above prejudice, and knows no passion save 
that of devotion to the high concerns of the 
spirit. One of the privileges of mankind lies 
in " beholding the bright countenance of truth 
in the quiet and still air of delightful studies," 
and it is intolerable to think that this privilege 
is to be renounced because the fumes of anger 
have dulled men's higher faculties. For a 
time, it may well be, such intercourse will be 
held in abeyance, but it must in the end be 
resumed, and those who speak the tongues of 
Shakespeare and of Goethe must come to real- 
ize that they cannot do without one another, 
and that no people on earth can do without 
them. Let us pray that the day of that realiza- 
tion may be hastened, and "the golden years 
return." Meanwhile, pending such consum- 
mation, we can only say with Othello, " Oh, the 
pity of it!" WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



THE A. L. A. CONFERENCE. 

The thirty-seventh annual conference of 
the American Library Association, just com- 
pleted at Berkeley, Cal., has been marked by 
all the advantages and disadvantages of a 
convention in an exposition year, near an 
exposition town. The fair induces a large 
gathering, but it also distracts. Not all the 
librarians who registered as delegates spent 
their time, or most of it, in attendance upon 
the sessions of the convention. In the election 
of officers only 87 votes were cast, although 
the registered attendance was about 700. The 
absence of a contest partly explains this dis- 
crepancy, but not entirely so. The atmosphere 
of the meeting was perfect. The Univer- 
sity of California had opened its hospitable 
doors to the conference, and not only were 



general and sectional meetings held in its 
well-appointed halls, but a large proportion 
of the delegates found accommodation in the 
fraternity and sorority houses, besides those 
who stayed at the hotels and the few who pre- 
ferred living in San Francisco. 

There were the usual courtesies, of course. 
The University gave a reception in the unique 
Hearst gymnasium; the City of Oakland en- 
tertained the delegates at a luncheon, and the 
authorities of Mills College, among the resi- 
dential hills of that city, opened their fine 
grounds for a lawn party. The exposition 
management welcomed the Association with a 
brass band, behind which its somewhat 
amused, but very appreciative, members 
marched to the Court of the Four Seasons, 
where they received official welcome on a 
bronze plaque, and the freedom of the fair. 

The meeting was noteworthy as being some- 
thing of a family affair among the members. 
No outsider, eminent or otherwise, addressed 
it. Even California's lieutenant-governor, 
announced on the programme to speak at one 
of the sessions, was called away to Sacramento 
by urgent state business. None of the literary 
stars, of whom California has more than one 
in her firmament, intruded his presence or 
extruded his opinions. There were addresses 
on books and on printing by two New York- 
ers not members of the Association Henry 
W. Kent, secretary of the Metropolitan Mu- 
seum, and T. M. Cleland ; but these gentlemen 
spoke as friends of libraries and lovers of 
books, rather than as outsiders. To make up 
for the absent statesmen and litterateurs, the 
Association listened to some of the best that 
its own members were able to furnish. Note- 
worthy among the papers was a charmingly 
appreciative critique of modern poetry by 
Miss May Massee, editor of the Association's 
" Booklist," in which she showed that poetry- 
is to-day coming into its own, if we are to 
judge by the increased use and appreciation 
of it by readers in our public libraries. Mr. 
Richard R. Bowker, the veteran editor of 
" The Library Journal," spoke on " The Func- 
tion of the Public Library," sketching the his- 
tory of the New York Public Library as a 
typical example of library development a 
choice perhaps not altogether justified, as few 
institutions can boast of so remarkable, varied, 
and interesting a history. The tendencies of 
modern library architecture were sketched, 
with pictorial illustrations, by Mr. Chalmers 
Hadley, librarian of the Denver Public Li- 
brary. The trend of branch library develop- 
ment, according to Mr. Hadley, is now away 
from the " butterfly type," with its book body 
and adult and juvenile wings, about which we 



1915 



used to hear so much, and toward a rectangu- 
lar one- room arrangement, less formal and 
more homelike. This is doubtless true, but it 
should be noted that this arrangement is 
hardly suited for large city branches, unless 
the librarian is willing to exclude adults 
altogether from his ministrations. In such 
branches we cannot yet do without a separate 
children's room. For large central buildings 
the speaker commended a kind of " loft " plan, 
with few fixed partitions, and division of 
book-stacks into sections capable of easy ex- 
pansion and contraction. This type of library 
is related to those with which we are familiar, 
somewhat as the Japanese house with its 
screens is to the familiar American home. It 
is well exemplified in the new library of 
Springfield, Mass., and we are likely to see a 
further extension of it in the Cleveland build- 
ing, now planning, where the librarian is con- 
sidering the abandonment of the orthodox 
stack room, building his floors strong enough 
to hold book-shelves wherever he may want to 
place them. Flexibility, however, is not the 
only desideratum in a library, and we shall 
probably still continue to see buildings with 
fixed partitions. 

Among the things done by the Association 
for the improvement of library service 
throughout the country were the appointment 
of a committee to cooperate in the expansion 
of the Decimal System of classification a 
step taken with the expressed approval of 
Dr. Melvil Dewey, the author of the system; 
the extension of the schedule for uniform 
statistical reports to cover the activities of col- 
lege and reference libraries ; and the authori- 
zation of a printed manual setting forth the 
general rules, and especially the limitations, 
under which loans of books between one 
library and another are carried out. 

The election of officers resulted in the choice 
of Miss Mary W. Plummer for president 
the second woman who has held the office. As 
head of the Pratt Institute Library School, 
and later of the school established by the New 
York Public Library, Miss Plummer has long 
been a conspicuous figure among librarians, 
and has exercised an undoubted and valuable 
influence on the progress of libraries in the 
United States, her pupils occupying librarian- 
ships or other responsible positions in every 
state of the union. 

The final session witnessed a plea for a more 
active participation by libraries in pacificist 
propaganda. The speaker, Mr. George F. 
Bowerman, librarian of the public library at 
"Washington, D. C., argued that the library, 
as an essentially peaceful institution, would be 
only adopting a measure of self-preservation 



by stressing the value of peace whenever it 

could do so in its activities. In the discussion 

that followed, other members deprecated an 

attempt to commit libraries in favor of any 

i movement, no matter how righteous, arguing 

that their non-partisanship is their most valu- 

I able asset and that departure from it in one 

; instance might make it difficult for them to 

I resist taking sides in other questions. 

An immediate result of this discussion was 
the dispatch of a message from the Associa- 
tion to President Wilson, conveying its sym- 
pathy and expressing confidence that what- 
ever course he might pursue in the present 
crisis would tend ultimately to the establish- 
ment of international peace. While this seems 
unobjectionable, some members expressed an 
opinion that the message was capable of inter- 
pretation as urging " peace-at-any-price," and 
regretted its form as an excursion beyond 
those professional limits which such a body as 
ours usually, with great propriety, establishes 
for its actions and pronouncements. 

The local and travel arrangements for the 
convention were carried out with unusual 
smoothness, the former by a local committee 
of librarians the latter by the Association's 
own travel committee. Most of the eastern 
delegates proceeded to the conference by spe- 
cial train from Chicago, in an itinerary em- 
bracing stops at Denver and Glenwood 
Springs, Colo., Salt Lake City, Riverside and 
San Diego, Cal., for the inspection of local 
libraries and incidental rest and refreshment. 
Altogether, the members have concluded 
that neither the beauties of California's scen- 
ery nor the hospitality of her citizens have 
diminished since their last visit, four years

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE CONSOLATIONS OF LITERATURE, like those 
of philosophy, avail but little against the 
really serious ills of our mortal lot. Neither 
literature nor philosophy can bake bread to 
feed a war-devastated Belgium or Poland, but 
what little a good book can do to render less 
intolerable the consciousness of the world's 
present wretched plight, seems to be appre- 
ciated by not a few who are much nearer to 
the seat of the hideous gangrene than we of 
the western world. In a letter from Paris to 
" The Book Monthly," of London, Mr. James 
Milne says, among other interesting things: 
"Nearly every Frenchman who writes is at 
the war, or doing something for it other than 
writing. Bookshops which were closed when, 
the Germans threatened Paris, have gradually

women who must read, because reading is 
part of his or her nature, are turning to the 
old masters, to the classics, the old familiar 
faces in print. They are reading Moliere, and 
Mirabeau, and Victor Hugo, and all the great 
ornaments of their literature, including that 
living master, Anatole France. They are 
reading for inspiration, of which they are 
themselves full, and they are reading for the 
consolation which a trusty book is in an hour 
when somebody has lost somebody near and 
dear. They are essentially a literary people, 
the French, full of all the charm which we 
associate with the pretty page of a good book, 
so scholarly in their knowledge, so adept at 
using it, so logical and clear in their style of 
writing and their manner of reading. They 
combine poesy with pure reason, and the sun 
shines through both with a quality which is 
alike clarifying and warming." From an- 
other source of information, the reports of 
the municipal lending libraries, it is learned 
that Paris is reading many more books than 
it read a year ago, even though its popula- 
tion has been diminished by several hundred 
thousand persons. In the first four months of 
this year the libraries circulated more than 
thirteen thousand volumes in excess of the 
circulation for the same period last year ; and 
the quality of the reading is reported to be as 
creditable as the quantity. If the war is thus 
really turning the people, or even a small 
fraction of the people, back to the best things 
and the serious things in literature, it is ac- 
complishing at least a grain of good to help 
offset the mountain of evil. 


AN ARRESTED AUCTION SALE OF VALUABLE 

AUTOGRAPHS and other kindred matter is one 
of the recent events of interest to collectors 
of literary rarities. The lately discovered 
" Weare Papers," lost for a century and com- 
prising a wealth of historical material of 
great value, were to have passed under the 
hammer a part of them-, at least in Phila- 
delphia early this month; but an injunction 
stopped the sale, the proper ownership of the 
papers being in dispute. As is already known 
to many, the Weare collection takes its name 
from Meshech Weare, first governor of New 
Hampshire after the Revolution, and it is 
upon the early history of that State that these 
documents will be found to throw such light 
as probably to make necessary the re-writing 
of that history. As Americana of inestima- 
ble worth, their sale at auction would have 
realized a very pretty fortune for the person 
or persons now claiming their ownership. So 



far as has yet been determined, the papers 
seem to have come not quite regularly or 
legally into the possession of Jacob C. Moore, 
an early historian of New Hampshire, asso- 
ciated with John Farmer in the compilation 
of Farmer and Moore's "Historical Collec- 
tions," and this Moore left the material to his 
son of the same name, who in turn bequeathed 
it to a kinsman, Mr. Frank C. Moore, of 
Brooklyn, in whose possession a part of it was 
not long ago discovered by persons interested 
in such researches. Another portion seems to 
be held by another of the original Moore's- 
descendants in Montclair, N. J., though how 
the division came about, and who is the right- 
ful owner of the whole treasure, does not yet 
appear. To stimulate further curiosity as to 
this collection of rarities, not by any means to 
satisfy it, let it be noted that it contains, for 
instance, a deposition before Governor Brad- 
ford and John Alden of New Plymouth, with 
the rare signatures of the Mayflower passen- 
gers; twenty-nine autograph letters of Wash- 
ington; Governor Wentworth's proclamation 
of a day of thanksgiving for the capture of 
Quebec, dated November 4, 1759 ; and a copy 
of the first publication of the Declaration of 
Independence in New Hampshire. The New 
Hampshire Attorney-General's attempt to re- 
cover possession of these precious papers is 
most natural, and the disinterested outsider 
must hope that he will succeed. 



A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN COOPERATIVE CATA- 
LOGUING, a branch of library work for which 
the Library of Congress has of late years 
done so much by its issue of standard cards- 
ready for insertion in the card-catalogue, 
comes to public notice in an announcement 
that appears in "The Wilson Bulletin" of 
recent date. This is, in brief, to the effect 
that the H. W. Wilson Company, of White- 
Plains, N. Y., has added to its various pub- 
lications now familiar to most librarians a 
form of catalogue that can be used by almost 
any American public library, and is "practi- 
cally the fulfilment of Professor Jewett's idea 
of a general catalogue of all the books of the 
country." In this undertaking " the work of 
cataloguing each title is done once for all and 
the entry preserved by means of the modern 
linotype slug. Each of these slugs contains 
a line of type in permanent form, and these 
slugs can be assembled and reassembled an 
infinite number of times and in any form 
desired. Stock catalogues are issued from 
time to time, in standard editions of varying 
sizes, and the library may purchase as many 
copies as desired of the edition corresponding 
most closely to its needs, checking in them if 



1915] 



THE DIAL

desirable the titles which the library has. It 
is also possible for a library to have its own 
catalogue, by merely checking in one of the 
stock editions the titles desired and sending 
it in. The proper slugs can be withdrawn 
from their places in the central body of the 
type, assembled, and if other titles are to be 
added, slugs for these can be prepared from 
copy furnished by the library, the whole 
assembled in proper order and the desired 
number of copies struck off, after which the 
slugs are returned to their proper places." 
A manifest saving of time and money is thus 
effected, and one is spared the necessity of 
doing laboriously what already has been 
done, or is being done, or will be done, hun- 
dreds of times, by others. 


THE PATH TO PERFECTION, as someone has 
said, leads through a series of disgusts. With 
Bronson Alcott one of these disgusts took the 
form of distaste for animal food; or so he 
tried to persuade himself and the world when 
he sought refuge at Fruitlands from the car- 
nal allurements of beef, pork, mutton, poul- 
try, and fish. The story of that short-lived 
colony of vegetarians striving to attain to 
high thinking by plain living and hard man- 
ual labor is agreeably told by its founder and 
some of his associates in " Bronson Alcott's 
Fruitlands" (noticed more fully on another 
page) , a book that offers many amusing or 
more seriously interesting passages for quota- 
tion. Here, for example, is a sketch of the 
method by which mortal frailty and error are 
to be combated : " On a revision of our pro- 
ceedings it would seem, that if we were in the 
right course in our particular instance, the 
greater part of man's duty consists in leaving 
alone much that he is in the habit of doing. 
It is a fasting from the present activity, 
rather than an increased indulgence in it, 
which, with patient watchfulness, tends to 
newness of life. 'Shall I sip tea or coffee?' 
the inquiry may be. No; abstain from all 
ardent, as from alcoholic drinks. 'Shall I 
consume pork, beef, or mutton ? ' Not if you 
value health or life. ' Shall I stimulate with 
milk ? ' No. ' Shall I warm my bathing 
water ? ' Not if cheerfulness is valuable. 
' Shall I clothe in many garments ? ' Not if 
purity is aimed at. ' Shall I prolong my 
hours, consuming animal oil and losing bright 
daylight in the morning?' Not if a clear 
mind is an object. ' Shall I teach my chil- 
dren the dogmas inflicted on myself, under 
the pretence that I am transmitting truth ? ' 
Nay, if you love them intrude not these be- 
tween them and the Spirit of all Truth." 
And more questions of like sort, with the 



same negative answer. "Be not so active to 
do, as sincere to be." The charms of the sim- 
ple life have been glowingly depicted by 
many writers since Alcott's time, but those 
unsuccessful attempts, at Brook Farm and 
Fruitlands, to perpetuate that life, still re- 
tain their interest and their pathos for us of 
to-day. . . . 

ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THE WIDENER LI- 
BRARY, a subject of unfailing interest to book- 
lovers and book-collectors, comes to our 
attention in " The Harvard Crimson," from 
the pen of an unnamed librarian of promi- 
nence. Apropos of the approaching dedica- 
tion of the new Harvard library building he 
writes: "In the centre of the new building 
will be two rooms in which his [Widener's] 
own collection of rare books will be kept. 
Widener began to buy books while in college, 
and very soon became interested in the first 
editions of the English writers whom he read. 
He was especially fond of Stevenson, and 
the collection of Stevenson's works became 
Widener's especial hobby. He had secured 
nearly every one of the Stevenson rarities, 
and a few others which his mother has since 
purchased for the collection make this by far 
the most complete in existence. His first edi- 
tions of Dickens, Thackeray, Tennyson, and 
other nineteenth-century authors were nearly 
as complete, and a large number of his vol- 
umes had autograph inscriptions of the writ- 
ers. . . He had a good many of the famous 
books of English literature written in the ear- 
lier centuries. Caxton's 'Royal Book,' the- 
four Shakespeare folios, Ben Jonson's worksy 
Beaumont and Fletcher, Florio's Montaigne, 
and Defoe's 'Robinson Crusoe' are a few of 
the more famous of these volumes which will 
be placed on exhibition next fall." The loss 
sustained by young Mr. Widener's growing 
collection in the sinking of the " Titanic," 
which at the same time cut short the life of 
the collector himself, is a disaster still fresh 
in memory. . . , 

THE ASCETICISM OF ART, the necessity of 
forgoing material satisfactions if one would 
depict with insight and power, whether with 
brush or pen, some aspect of life as the ideal- 
ist sees it, is an ancient but an ever-fruitful 
theme. Dr. Earl Barnes contributes to " The 
Popular Science Monthly" for June an arti- 
cle on "The Celibate Women of To-day," in 
which he essays some adequate < answer to the 
question, "Why do so many women elect to 
walk through life alone ? " In recounting the- 
compensations of celibacy he takes occasion to- 
say, aptly and well : " Our real living is never 
in the mere possession and use of things, but 



12

[ June 24 



in what we think and feel about them. Lower 
animals live in facts; man lives in his ideas 
and ideals. All life's values must be found 
on the way ; when we arrive we are always in 
danger of becoming unconscious and so losing 
what we came to get. This is why art and lit- 
erature have always had to find their charac- 
ters in the struggling classes, the poor and the 
rich. The smug middle classes and the com- 
fortably rich have the facts of existence; but 
they do not know it. The universal contempt 
of those who know for such unconscious living 
finds expression in the terms bourgeoisie, phil- 
istines, and bromides. On the other hand, 
struggling and self-conscious groups always 
attract and interest us. Bohemia is poor; it 
lacks the facts of property; but it has the 
most alluring of all festivals and immortal 
banquets. Who, that has a soul as well as a 
stomach, would not turn from a banquet of 
facts at twenty dollars a plate, with dull un- 
consciousness of life in the people, to a group 
of dreamers and wits with very modest fare, 
and twenty-dollar talk at table? . . . The 
poet Dante illustrates in his own life the rela- 
tive value of facts and dreams, of living life 
directly and living it vicariously, to a singu- 
lar degree." All this, with more in the same 
vein, is everlastingly true, and no wise person 
would have it otherwise; although at times, 
in the unreasoning hunger that will occasion- 
ally assail even the best of us, it is a little 
dismaying to reflect that by no possibility can 
we continue to have our cake if we insist upon 

eating it. 



SEVENTEEN SELECTED CANDIDATES FOR THE 
HALL OF FAME of New York University are 
announced by Chancellor Emeritus Mac- 
Cracken, chairman of the Hall of Fame Com- 
mittee. More than two hundred names were 
sent in by that portion of the public inter- 
ested in this quinquennial ceremony, and 
from this number the hundred electors ap- 
pointed for the purpose chose seventeen, 
which it will be their further duty to reduce 
to five next September, there being but five 
tablets available every five years for perpetu- 
ating the fame of illustrious Americans. In 
the preliminary list place has been found for 
but one author, and even he might, through 
some unwisdom in the ultimate selection, be 
cast out. Here is the list, which will not be 
new to all readers : Francis Parkman, author ; 
Mark Hopkins, educator; Alice Freeman 
Palmer, teacher; Horace Bushnell, preacher 
and theologian; Joseph Henry, Benjamin

COMMUNICATIONS. 

THE GROWTH OF THE WHITMAN "LEGEND." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A few evenings ago I attended the annual ban- 
quet of the Walt Whitman Fellowship of Chicago, 
held upon the anniversary of the poet's birth, 
May 31. The Fellowship is not an " organiza- 
tion," and its banquets are projected and carried 
out with as few formalities as possible. If you 
are a " kindred spirit " you are welcome. Upon 
the occasion referred to something like 350 men 
and women falling, supposititiously, in this classifi- 
cation, sat down to the banquet. It is manifestly 
improper to allude to anything Whitmanic as a 
" function " ; so it may be said that these affairs, 
originally very limited in scope, have within the 
past few years assumed quite imposing propor- 
tions. 

There was an extremely interesting programme. 
The list of speakers included numerous well- 
known names, and Walt was " considered " in 
various aspects by various devotees. Also, poems 
were read or recited which were offered as typical 
products of the "new poetry," whose pedigree 
it need not be inquired too closely how was 
asserted to trace back, in the direct line of descent, 
to the Camden bard. 

Listening attentively to everything that was 
presented, I could not but marvel at the rapid 
growth of the Whitman " legend." While Walt 
died as lately as 1892 but twenty-three years 
ago, it is apparent that the day is not far dis- 
tant when he will assume an aspect almost mythi- 
cal. That the number of Whitman " fans " is 
steadily increasing is evident; but that their con- 
ception of the poet is as nebulous as was the 
classical conception of Homer, the banquet made 
plain. In no other way can their enthusiastic 
acceptance of and applause for the most gro- 
tesque assertions about him be explained. 

If Walt's own word is good for anything, he 
sought to inculcate nothing so much as tolerance. 
" There is room for everything in the Leaves," he 
said. And when somebody asked him, " Even for 
Matthew Arnold?" (who was almost his greatest 
aversion among his own contemporaries) he re- 
turned: "Yes even for him!" But, listening 
to the " interpreters " who held forth from the 
speakers' table, I gathered an overwhelming im- 
pression of the most fanatical intolerance. Broad- 
sides were poured upon all sorts of hated objects, 
literary, social, human and divine. The vocab- 
ulary of objurgation and contempt was ransacked 
for the strongest epithets, and the stream of de- 
nunciation foamed and lashed about every obstacle 
in its path. And draping it all was what I have 
previously referred to a series of depictions of 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



13 



the poet himself, as distinguished from his ideas 
and his influence, that was so compendiously un- 
veracious as to make anyone who really knew the 
facts stare in undisguised amazement. 

While not occupying the chief position upon the 
list of speakers, undoubtedly the most eagerly 
anticipated orator of the evening was a gentleman 
with a wide reputation as an advocate of " the 
new freedom " in what might be termed its most 
ultra phases. Gifted with a voice of plangent 
resonance and with marked forensic ability, and 
throwing himself ardently into his subject, he 
delivered a discourse that enraptured the vast 
majority of his auditors. That it did not particu- 
larly enrapture me was, I suppose, because it 
presented to me a Whitman that I failed to recog- 
nize; for the speaker seemed to possess almost 
encyclopedic ignorance of Whitman the man and 
of the forces and the environment that produced 
him. 

Among his statements, for instance, were these: 
That Whitman was born in poverty, never went 
to school in his life, was almost wholly without 
means of literary culture; that his career was one 
unbroken struggle against want and discourage- 
ment ; and that he " died in a hovel, in poverty 
and despair." The facts are that the family into 
which Walt was born was not poverty-stricken; 
that Walt himself enjoyed more " schooling " than 
did many another young American of his time 
belonging to the social stratum of which he was a 
part; that he began work in a newspaper office 
while in his early teens and for years remained a 
member of the " fourth estate " ; that he was also 
a school-teacher for a number of years as a young 
man; that his early literary efforts were accepted 
and published in what were then the leading 
journals of the metropolis, and some of them 
appeared in book form ; that he was at this period 
a frequenter of the theatre, the opera, and the 
libraries, and came into contact with a majority 
of the "literati" and the " intellectuals " best 
worth knowing ; sported a silk hat, a boutonniere, 
a cane, and affected the appearance and the habits 
of the carpet knight rather than the shirt-sleeved 
protagonist of the " open road." 

Furthermore, we know that later on he for a 
considerable time enjoyed a government clerkship 
at Washington which left him much ef his time to 
dispose of as he pleased; that, from the date of 
the appearance of " Leaves of Grass," while he 
had a hard fight for recognition as a poet, he was 
nevertheless never without prominent advocates, 
eulogists, and " promoters " ; that a constantly 
growing band of enthusiasts gathered around him, 
with unfailing support, both pecuniary and moral ; 
that edition after edition of his poems was printed 
and bought, and that individual pieces appeared 
in many of the leading magazines and newspapers, 
while he was also called upon to compose and de- 
liver special effusions at notable public gatherings 
and celebrations; that he had a strong following 
overseas, and that within his own lifetime the 
translation of the " Leaves " into foreign lan- 
guages was being taken up. Finally, we know 
that during all his last years a group of the most 



devoted friends gravitated around him; that all 
his wants were sedulously fulfilled; that he had 
the best medical attendance procurable; that he 
had a nurse and a housekeeper to care for him; 
that he lived in a house that was his own property 
and for years had been; that he was buried in a 
mausoleum which he had himself caused to be 
constructed for the Whitman family, at a cost, I 
find it stated, of some $4000; and that his execu- 
tors, "much to their surprise," found, upon his 
death, that he had a balance of several thousands 
of dollars to his credit in a local bank. 

The orator to whom I refer was either ignorant 
of these facts, or else, for purposes best known to 
himself, he not merely ignored but perverted them 
in order to draw a picture of a persecuted man, 
upon whom no ray of sunshine ever fell and who 
died a pauper in the blackest woe. At the same 
time, this orator declared in accents that made the 
chandeliers vibrate, that the purpose of his re- 
marks was to elucidate the sacred cause to which 
Whitman devoted himself and all his works the 
exposition of the Truth, with a capital T ! 

" What is truth ?" said an historic inquisitor 
ages ago, when in doubt regarding an Immortal 
Personage. None of us can be too certain. But 
Walt, we may take it as assured, is destined to be 
one of our immortals, and the facts about him are 
on record. That is, some of them are there are 
others which, for reasons of his own, he chose 
carefully to suppress. Perhaps what we do not 
know and never can notably, of the " veiled 
period " would be of great help to us in our 
efforts to unriddle the enigma that, in many ways, 
he presents to us. But what we do know is easily 
ascertainable, for there is a whole library of the 
" documents in the case." 

Walt himself, with his unique insight into so 
many of the peculiarities of what he was fond of 
referring to as the human " critter," had a pre- 
monition that it would be wise for him to avoid 
identifying himself with clubs, fellowships, et 
cetera, whose avowed purpose was the dissemina- 
tion of his doctrines. Some clairvoyance seemed 
to warn him, and he steadily refused to give them 
his personal sanction. He had, to be sure, his own 
little private cenacle, whose incense he found very 
grateful; but the spectacle of the Browning and 
Shakespeare societies caused him resolutely to 
keep within its confines. He preferred to " leave 
it to the Leaves," in which he was not mis- 
taken. At the banquet, however, the " Leaves " 
were not conspicuous. Only one of the speakers 
incorporated any of them into his or her dis- 
course; and the table in the anteroom where they 
were on sale seemed unattractive to most of the 
banqueters. 

We may say confidently of Walt, however, that, 
while he chose to maintain an almost sphinx-like 
reticence regarding certain phases of his career, 
those which he did desire recorded he wished set 
down with complete veracity. Only recently I 
have completed my reading of the third and latest 
volume of Horace Traubel's bulky series, " With 
Walt Whitman in Camden," and all are replete 
with injunctions to alter, expurgate, suppress, or 



14

veneer absolutely nothing. Nevertheless, the evi- 
dence is that Walt's "legend" is growing like 
some tropical parasite, that within no very long 
time it will so obscure his true proportions as to 
render them imperceptible save to the student and 
the historian. Creeping all over the surface of 
this colossal rough-hewn monolith will be an in- 
sidious growth of " interpretative " fable and 
falsification effectually hiding the reality from 
view not only hiding, but defacing and defiling 
it. That, during his lifetime, he was the victim of 
much misapprehension and misinterpretation is a 
commonplace of Whitman history in which, 
however, he differed not at all from a host of other 
great poets and innovators. That his posthumous 
fate will be similar, in degree if not in kind, there 
is every reason to believe. 

JOHN L. HERVEY. 
Chicago, June 14, 1915. 



THE WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY SUEVEY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The article in your current issue entitled "A 
Bull in the Educational China Shop " is enter- 
taining. Will your readers care to have three or 
four facts which will help furnish a frame into 
which to fit permanently your picture of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin survey? 

The questions of which you speak as harassing 
were submitted to the faculty after conference 
with university officers. Including space for 
answers, they took 39, not 50 pages. Of them the 
president wrote : " These questions will give an 
opportunity to the members of the faculty to pre- 
sent their cases fairly." 

You quote the following statement : " The sur- 
vey of the graduate school has been mainly di- 
rected to its clothes rather than to the living 
being beneath the clothes." The survey of the 
graduate school and graduate work showed the 
following: Flaunting plagiarism; slovenly work- 
manship and unscholarly writing; lack of orig- 
inality; lack of purpose and application; lack 
of opportunities for specialization; presence of 
graduate students in freshman and sophomore 
classes, including nine students who were doing 
exclusively freshman and sophomore work; in- 
ability of candidates for a Ph.D. degree to read 
foreign languages on November 1 coupled with 
certification of their ability to read foreign lan- 
guages a fortnight later; lack of plan for re- 
search; failure of many departments to develop 
in absentia graduate work; the fact that of 389 
students enrolled as graduate students 163 had 
faculty connection; that of these 389 only 50 
were doing exclusively graduate work and that 
of these 50, 34 had faculty connection; lack of 
supervision; specific instances of graduate work 
that was of grammar school grade, high school 
grade, freshman and junior grade; the fact that 
a master's degree is given by several departments 
merely for a fifth year of study without speciali- 
zation; the university's endorsement of Ph.D. 
theses after glaring defects had been pointed out 
by the survey. If these are the " clothes," what 



is the " living being beneath the clothes " in the 
graduate school? 

The plagiarism of one thesis is admitted by 
the university on page 356 of the report. 

Of a second thesis, the fact that it was " ap- 
proved by the editor of the series in which it was 
published " is cited as contributing evidence of its 
quality. The university comment did not state to 
the educational world that the editor in question 
is also the member of the faculty who approved 
the thesis and who also was joint author. 

Of a third thesis, Professor Hanus of Harvard 
wrote : " It is not a strong presentation. On a scale 
of 10 I should mark the thesis 6^/2, it being under- 
stood that a thesis graded 5 or below would not 
be accepted." Of this same thesis a Columbia 
professor wrote : " I should not accept it with its 
present organization." Both letters were written 
to the university, page 357. 

In support of the quality of work done by a 
fourth thesis writer, who specialized in experi- 
mental psychology and education, it is stated on 
page 357 that he " now occupies an honorable 
post in an eastern university." The " eastern " 
is Ohio, and the " university " is an institution 
that is not considered a university by readers of 
THE DIAL, or by the Carnegie Foundation, or by 
the Ohio legislature. The work of this specialist 
in education is minor extension work. 

Of a fifth thesis, page 358, Professor Reeves of 
Michigan wrote to the university : " 6 being fail- 
ure and 10 excellent I should rank the thesis not 
over 7." Professor Jenks of New York Uni- 
versity would have accepted this thesis, " with, 
however, the condition that it be rewritten." 

Of a sixth thesis, it is admitted that one chapter 
was taken bodily from an English work. This 
chapter is said by the university to be an " annex," 
although it is the next to the last chapter, with 
nothing whatever to indicate that it is not an 
important and integral part of the thesis. The 
university world was not told that the conclusions 
in this thesis and the greater part of the work 
appeared in a thesis accepted by the University of 
Paris in 1876. 

In defence of a seventh thesis, the university 
comment, page 355, says that if the material col- 
lected and used by the author " existed for any 
similar period of mediaeval history, it would be 
deemed worthy of publication in critical editions." 
The university world again was not told that the 
period for which this material was collected was 
the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, 
and that it consists of 35 letters from southern 
farmers. There is evidence of the use of only a 
small part of even this very small amount of 
material. What the farmers were asked, whether 
they wrote that they had no time to answer, or 
could not remember, or whether they wrote facts 
worth while, was not recorded. The other ma- 
terials upon which this thesis is based have been 
culled over for the most part by several other 
writers. If American scholarship were to be 
gauged by this quality and quantity of work, no 
one would be attributing the revival of learning 
to the introduction of research methods.

Will your readers also wish to know some of 
the 37 things which " the dean of the graduate 
school of the much lauded University of Wisconsin 
is not expected to do" 1 ? First, will you permit 
me to quote the statement from my report to the 
effect that these facts were not cited as evidence 
of incompetence or negligence of that officer, as 
you said? On the contrary, my report reads, 
page 163 : " The above list is given not to raise 
question as to whether the dean is doing all that 
may reasonably be expected of his office, but 
whether the university at present is expecting 
enough of the deanship of the graduate school." 
Who of THE DIAL'S readers needs to have evi- 
dence presented that it is not " desirable or prac- 
tical to do any one " of the following among 
the 37?

Will your readers wish to know the statement 
which drove the university to vernacular and to 
furnish the epitaph for the surveyor's mausoleum? 
The statement which is called " rot " is this : " So 
long as 183 different standards, unchecked and 
unsupervised administratively are employed . . 
in judging students' work . . the testing of work 
cannot be well enough done." Will you invite 
readers of THE DIAL to write you in case they 
do not find this statement rot? If it is rot, then 
a very large number of the faculty are guilty of 
writing rot because they wrote to the survey pro- 
testing against present conditions where work 
that is graded " failed " in one class would be 
called " fair " in another. 

One other illustration may help your readers. 
You state that " so ignorant is Dr. Allen of the 
meaning of numbers that he converts a cold sta- 
tistical statement that class-markings follow the 
law of distribution of averages into a deliberate 
intention on the part of the instructor to repress 
talent." As stated on pages 484-485, the purpose 
of the bulletin on class markings is " to convince 
high school teachers that year in and year out 
with students as they come proper marking will 



result in 2% excellent, 2% failed, 23% good, 23% 
poor and 50% fair." After showing that this 
statement did not apply to the university, that 
the principle was not at work at the university, 
the survey listed certain defects, page 485 inter 
alia. " Where attention of supervisors should be 
directed to quality of instruction this bulletin 
directs it to distribution of marks." " The appli- 
cation of this principle is not only unfair to indi- 
vidual children but inhibits where the university 
should stimulate the determination of teachers to 
produce excellent results out of seemingly difficult 
or even seemingly hopeless material." " It leaves 
no hope that a whole class may be brought nearer 
a standard of excellence than was ever done be- 
fore." " Interest is diverted from the work the 
child does to the marks other children have re- 
ceived." Instead of convincing a teacher that the 
percentage of failures or poors in her subject 
should disappear as the quality of her teaching 
improves and the size of her classes decreases, the 
bulletin declares, page 10 : " If the teacher has 
to do only with small classes the results of several 
years' marking, or of several classes in the same 
subject in the same year, should, when put to- 
gether, be similar to the marks of a larger group 
given at one time." 

Finally, your readers may wish to know that 
although the survey set out to be cooperative, 
although every statement was sent to the uni- 
versity for confirmation or conference so as to 
secure agreement as to fact, and although agree- 
ment was easily reached with respect to early 
sections until the university discontinued confer- 
ence with the survey, the following changes were 
made after I left the state without submitting 
them to the board of public affairs, or the uni- 
versity regents, or the advisory committee or to 
me: Sections publicly agreed to by the university 
last October are now excoriated. Ninety-eight 
times my name is used in the first five pages, and 
259 times in the first 25 pages of the university 
comment. Sections clearly marked as written by 
others are first called mine and then personally 
attacked. One important section written by a 
former faculty member who had been for several 
years in the division which he reported upon, was 
never shown to me, was written by arrangement 
with the dean, and yet now for publicity purposes 
is first called mine and then bitterly criticized with 
such expressions as " unsympathetic," " desire to 
injure," "grossly unfair," etc. 

Will American scholars who do not accept 
plagiarized theses, who do not assign work for 
graduate students that can be done by a clerk 
who has never gone to high school, who do not 
approve warmed-over, long-winded, disorganized 
lectures, who are incapable of telling untruth or of 
intimidating truth, accept ex parte criticism of a 
work in which 600 faculty members joined, or 
will the 600 be given a chance to tell their story as 
they have told it in the survey report?

A GREAT AMERICAN NATURALIST.* 

A number of years ago, one of the Wright 
brothers was making an aeroplane at Dayton, 
Ohio, when an old man, a neighbor, stopped 
to remonstrate with him. " What a pity it is," 
he said, " that a clever young fellow like you 
should so waste his time and money." Mr. 
Wright pled, in self-defence, that he really 
expected to get practical results, when his old 
friend interrupted, and in solemn tones ad- 
monished him : " Young man, let me tell you 
this: if anyone ever makes a flying machine 
that will fly, it will not be anybody in 
Dayton!" 

The Americans are often accused of being 
a boastful people, who like to hear their eagle 
scream; but a close student of our history 
may find evidences of an excess of humility 
which has been positively harmful. Quite in 
the spirit of the old man of Dayton, we have 
been slow to recognize scientific ability, not 
merely in its incipient stages, but even after 
the work has proved its worth. Thus it hap- 
pens that the name of Baird, a truly great 
man judged by the quality and quantity of 
his accomplishments, is practically unknown 
outside of a comparatively small scientific 
circle. Student and teacher at Dickinson Col- 
lege, Carlisle, Pa., he was gratefully remem- 
bered by his old pupils and associates; but a 
recent graduate of that institution assured 
the reviewer that he had never heard the name 
of the naturalist. He was the creator of the 
U. S. National Museum; yet the visitor to 
Washington finds neither statue nor inscrip- 
tion on the grounds to commemorate his work. 
At Woods Hole, Mass., where he founded a 
great laboratory for the study of marine life, 
and where he died in 1887, there is indeed an 
appropriate tablet on a large granite boulder ; 
while more recently a bust of Baird was 
placed in the American Museum in New York 
City. 

Agassiz and Baird belong to the same gen- 
eral period, and were variously associated in 
much of their work. Yet why is it that 
Agassiz is everywhere remembered, while 
Baird is forgotten or was never generally 
known? In many respects their labors ran 
parallel : each founded and developed a great 
natural history museum, each published great 
contributions to American zoology, each in- 
spired and taught numerous young men who 
have since continued the work they began.

A Biography. By William 
Philadelphia : J. B. Lippin- 



When we compare the results item by item, it 
is impossible to give Baird a second place. 
Agassiz came with a great European reputa- 
tion, was a fascinating and picturesque char- 
acter; Baird was a plain American, hard- 
working and modest. It is impossible to re- 
sist the appeal which Agassiz makes to the 
imagination, and we would grudge him none 
of his fame; but after all, Baird deserves a 
much better place in the minds of his coun- 
trymen than he has ever held. Individually 
and as a nation we need to cultivate a better 
appreciation of good work done in unsensa- 
tional ways, and a readier recognition of 
native American talent. 

After the death of Professor Baird plans 
were made for the preparation of a biog- 
raphy, but for various reasons the work was 
delayed until it seemed in danger of being 
abandoned. Baird's daughter, Miss Lucy 
Baird, was keenly interested in the project, 
and had accumulated much valuable material, 
but her death in 1913 left everything unfin- 
ished. Miss Baird did, however, leave instruc- 
tions to her executor to see the memoir 
completed if possible ; and fortunately at this 
juncture Dr. W. H. Dall, on being appealed 
to, consented to undertake the work. Dr. 
Dall of the U. S. National Museum, eminent as 
a naturalist and keenly appreciative of 
Baird's character and labors, having worked 
under Baird for many years, was in every 
respect the most suitable person to write the 
book. More than occupied with his own im- 
portant researches, for the completion of 
which even the long life we all wish him must 
be wholly inadequate, it was no small thing 
to turn aside and undertake the preparation 
of a voluminous biography. Yet it was abun- 
dantly worth while, and we cannot be suffi- 
ciently grateful that the record has been made 
in an adequate manner, before it was alto- 
gether too late. 

Dr. Dall has not attempted any elaborate 
or complete analysis of Baird's scientific work, 
which stands as published, and can be re- 
viewed in detail at any subsequent time. He 
has rather chosen to present to us the man 
himself, the manner of his life, his friend- 
ships and ideals, the growth of his personality, 
and all those intimate things which if not told 
by those who knew him, could scarcely be 
known to posterity. Perhaps the strongest 
impression we get is that of wonder at Baird's 
early maturity, his surprising ability as a 
zoologist when little more than a boy. This 
was well understood by his associates, and by 
the various eminent naturalists of the day 
with whom he became acquainted. Thus, at 
the age of seventeen, he discovered a new

bird, and wrote to the celebrated ornithologist 
Audubon : 

" You see, sir, that I have taken (after much 
hesitation) the liberty of writing to you. I am 
but a boy and very inexperienced, as you no doubt 
will observe from my description of the Flycatcher. 
My brother last year commenced the study of our 
Birds, and after some months I joined him. He 
has gone elsewhere to settle and I am left alone." 

To which Audubon replied: 

" On my return home from Charleston, S. C., 
yesterday, I found your kind favor of the 4th 
instant in which you have the goodness to inform 
me that you have discovered a new species of fly- 
catcher, and which, if the bird corresponds to your 
description, is, indeed, likely to prove itself hitherto 
undescribed, for, although you speak of yourself 
as being a youth, your style and the descriptions 
you. have sent me prove to me that an old head 
may from time to time be found on young 
shoulders ! " 

The bird proved new, and was subsequently 
published by the brothers Baird. 

In 1846 Baird married Miss Mary Church- 
ill, who, though herself no naturalist, sympa- 
thetically supported all his endeavors. An old 
servant who was with Baird for nearly forty 
years was able to say that he never saw either 
one angry. In illustration of her mother's 
kindly tolerance and her father's sense of the 
value of time, Miss Lucy Baird set down the 
following story, as she got it from Mrs. Baird 
herself : 

" At the time of his courting, he was exceedingly 
busy with his college work and also studying very 
hard. After he became engaged, he was anxious 
of course to spend his evenings with his fiancee 
and yet did not feel that he could take all that 
time from his studies; so he fell into the habit of 
taking a book with him in order that he might 
carry on his studies and still have the pleasure of 
sitting in the room with her. Being an early riser 
and often taking long walks with^ his class, making 
collections, my father would be apt to get drowsy 
towards the end of the evening and was apt 
towards its close to fall asleep over his book; so 
when the hour arrived at which my mother knew 
he expected to leave, she would wake him up and 
send him home." 

Baird himself, in a letter to Professor Dana, 
thus describes his wife in 1850 : 

" My wife is a daughter of Gen. Churchill, 
Inspector-General of the Army, and a first-rate 
one she is, too. Not the least fear of snakes, sala- 
manders, and such other zoological interestings ; 
cats only are to her an aversion. Well educated 
and acquainted with several tongues, she usually 
reads over all my letters, crossing i's and dotting 
t's, sticking in here a period, and there a comma 
... In my absence, she answers letters of corre- 
spondents, and in my presence reads them. She 
transcribes my illegible MSS., correcting it withal, 
and does not grudge the money I spend in books. 
In addition to these literary accomplishments, she 



regulates her family well (myself included) and 
her daughter is the cleanest and most neatly dressed 
child in town." 

The daughter, Lucy, then about twenty-three 
months old, was "passionately fond of Natural 
History, admiring snakes above all things." 

How Baird, beginning as curator to the 
Smithsonian Institution, built up the U. S. 
National Museum, and did many other things 
in the service of science and of his country, 
must be gathered from the book itself ; which, 
while it chronicles Baird's life, is necessarily 
also to a large extent a history of the progress 
of American zoology during a large part of 
the nineteenth century.

THE " MOVIES " OLD AND NEW.* 

During the World's Columbian Exposition 
of 1893, Edison's Kinetoscope, a contrivance 
for showing photographs in motion to one 
person only for about thirty seconds at a time, 
was displayed to the public. Three years 
later, Sir Augustus Harris installed Robert 
Paul's " Theatrograph " at Olympia, a ma- 
chine fundamentally the same as the Bioscope 
of to-day. Contemporaneously with Mr. Paul's 
efforts, French inventors were developing the 
Cinematograph, a machine which was installed 
at the Eden Musee, New York, during the 
autumn of 1896. 

Only nineteen years have passed, therefore, 
since the theatrical debut of the motion pic- 
ture; yet to-day the business of purveying 
motion pictures theatrically to the American 
people is computed to be the fifth largest in- 
dustry in the United States. Nearly a million 
people of all ages and of both sexes attend 
daily the moving-picture theatres of Greater 
New York alone, the attendance throughout 
the other cities of the country being propor- 
tionally universal and no hamlet too small to 
be the home of a "movie" theatre. Indeed, 
the motion-picture play, or the photoplay, 
as it is technically called, far more than the 
stage play, has become the amusement of the 
nation. Beside the circulation of a photoplay 
that of a " best seller," or even that of a popu- 
lar ten cent magazine, becomes insignificant. 

Surely, such a power for good or evil should 
not be scorned by those having the welfare of 
the people at heart. Better would it be to 
exclaim : " I care not who makes the laws of 
the nation, if I may write its ' movie ' plays ! " 
Indeed, the photoplay offers to'the writer his 
widest means of artistic expression.

Picture Production. By Howard T. Dimick. Ridgewood,

To the word "artistic," exception will 
doubtless be taken by those who are in the 
habit of deriding the "movies" as vulgar 
clap-trap, too crude and garish to be consid- 
ered artistic; yet these scoffers seldom, if 
ever, attend "movie" performances and there- 
fore know little of the possibilities of this new 
form of theatrical art. Scarcely eighteen years 
old, it is only within the last five years, it 
might almost be said within the past year, 
that the photoplay has been developed into the 
multiple reel play, or the feature film, so- 
called. Previously the slapstick farce, or the 
crude melodrama in a single reel, was the 
offering. Now the filmed novel or stage play, 
presented by actors of established reputation, 
has relegated the one-reel film to the second 
class theatre, and raised the price of admis- 
sion in the better class of "movie" play- 
houses from five and ten cents to twenty-five 
and fifty cents, even in some instances to 
regular theatrical prices. This raising of the 
price has raised the standard of production, 
the public naturally being unwilling to pay 
fifty cents for the former five cents' worth. 
As in the case of the regular stage, the mana- 
gers seek plays that will appeal to the public, 
for without popular plays the " movie " indus- 
try would cease. Prior to the advent of the 
photoplay, thousands wrote for the regular 
stage, while only tens succeeded in getting 
their plays produced. Tens of thousands 
write for the movies now, and again it is a 
case of the survival of the fittest, the man 
without the dramatic sense having no more 
chance to succeed as a " movie " playwright 
save in that the volume of production is infi- 
nitely greater than he had as a writer for 
the regular stage. 

With such a bait to dangle before the eyes 
of literary aspirants as the sure attainment of 
successful "movie" authorship, the corre- 
spondence schools, manuscript readers, and 
literary advisers have been reaping a rich 
harvest. Small wonder that a considerable 
literature upon the art of writing photoplays 
has sprung into being, with the object of ap- 
pealing to the legion of men, women, and 
children who aspire to get rich quickly in the 
" movies." 

One of our comic weeklies recently pub- 
lished a quip to this effect: "Jones. *[ un- 
derstand Robinson is making a good living out 
of the short story. Brown. Why, I heard he 
had never had one accepted. Jones. He 
hasn't; he's writing articles on how to write 
them for a correspondence school." If the 
word " photoplay " be substituted here for 
" short story," Robinson becomes the type of 
man who gives instruction in the art of photo- 



play making, those who are deft in that art 
being too busily engaged in reaping the rich 
harvest their skill has brought forth, to find 
the time in which to initiate the public into 
the secret of their success. Yet to the rule that 
books on the " movies " are valueless, there is 
the proverbial exception ; since in " Photoplay 
Making," by Mr. Howard T. Dimick, many 
sane ideas are set forth, albeit in a somewhat 
cumbersome way. 

" From the drama of the stage," says Mr. 
Dimick, "I turned to that of the screen, after 
an experience as writer and critic of plays." 
As no record of his experience appears in that 
vade-mecum of successful endeavor, " Who's 
Who in America," and as his book is pub- 
lished in Ridgewood, New Jersey, it is easy to 
suspect Mr. Dimick of kinship with the Rob- 
inson of the comic weekly quip. Howsoever 
that may be, he has profited well by his 
experience as " writer and critic of plays," the 
real value of his book lying in the emphasis 
he lays upon the similarity between the photo- 
play and the stage play. Indeed, funda- 
mentally they are the same, their construction 
being governed by precisely the same laws; 
for though the technical methods of the two 
arts may differ considerably, "yet," as Mr. 
Dimick acutely observes, "the underlying 
dramatic principles of both forms of theatri- 
cal exposition are identical." 

The stage play appeals to the ear as well as 
to the eye ; therefore conditions that are sup- 
posed to exist before the commencement of a 
play may be set forth by dialogue. In the 
photoplay these conditions must be shown in 
action; but in the construction of his play 
the photoplaywright (if one may be pardoned 
the use of the word) is bound by the same 
dramatic laws as govern his colleague of the 
regular stage. The dramatic action in both 
instances must be logical, and must proceed 
from understandable causes to effects that 
seem so inevitable that they appeal sponta- 
neously either to our sympathy or our risibil- 
ity. Indeed, unity, sequence, cause and effect 
are as necessary in the one as in the other, 
and also atmosphere and characterization. 
The stage dramatist has the benefit of dia- 
logue, but is hampered by the restrictions 
which stage appliances impose. The photo- 
dramatist, on the other hand, is unlimited 
scenically; but is limited in utterance to the 
sub-titles and spoken titles he may flash on 
the screen. These, however, must be used 
sparingly, the ideal photoplay being under- 
standable, like the ideal pantomime, without 
a single explanatory word. 

Sir Arthur Wing Pinero calls drama "the 
art of compressing life without falsification," 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



19 



an apt definition which Mr. Dimick perti- 
nently qualifies in so far as it relates to photo- 
drama. "The complete play," he says, "is 
not in its ultimate analysis a ' mere screenful ' 
of life. It is or should be 'a screenful ' 
of art with the likeness of life." 

The task of the photo-dramatist, however, 
is far less arduous than that of the stage 
dramatist. In both instances dramatic sense 
is required, but the stage dramatist must pos- 
sess literary sense as well. Although both 
must think dramatically, the dramatist who 
writes stage plays must clothe his thoughts in 
language that will characterize not only the 
persons in his play, so that they appear real, 
but must unfold the story in a way that the 
audience may both understand and enjoy. It 
is this literary aspect of the stage drama 
which makes it the superior art, for in other 
respects photoplay making and stage play 
making are governed by the same fundamen- 
tal laws, the play in both instances being 
constructed in practically the same way 
through the preparation of a scene plat or 
scenario. 

This word, which calls to mind the Italian 
Commedia dell'Arte, recalls also the striking 
resemblance this popular entertainment of the 
renaissance bears in several particulars to the 
photo-drama of the present day, not only in 
its construction, but in the manner of its pro- 
duction. Indeed, it might almost be said that 
were the camera work eliminated, the photo- 
play of to-day would become peripatetic 
Commedia dell'Arte, the one appreciable dif- 
ference between the two being the fact that 
the scenes of a Commedia dell'Arte were acted 
upon a stationary stage, whereas those of the 
photoplay take place wherever the imagina- 
tion of the dramatist elects that they be 
performed. 

As in the Commedia dell'Arte, the dialogue 
of the photoplay scenario is unwritten, except 
in the case of passages which emphasize vital 
points of the story. In a Commedia dell'Arte 
these were called the doti or dowries; in the 
photoplay they are the " spoken titles " or 
" leaders," and are flashed on the screen. The 
construction, however, is so similar in both 
instances, that a photoplay producer could 
take the average Commedia dell'Arte scenario 
and " film " it almost without alteration, his 
method of rehearsing his company being so 
like that of the corago or stage manager of 
Italian Improvised Comedy, that it is difficult 
to believe the technique of photoplay acting 
is not a direct inheritance from that of the 
Commedia dell'Arte. 

The similarity between these two stage 
forms, which distinguishes them most from 



the regular drama, is the improvisate char- 
acter of their dialogue. Should the play- 
wright of the regular stage turn his scenario, 
or outline of his play, over to the stage man- 
ager, with no dialogue written except impor- 
tant lines, which the very blocking out of the 
play called, forth ; and should the stage man- 
ager read it to the company, scene by scene, 
and impress upon its members the various 
characters they are to play and the situations 
they are to unfold, but leave to their readiness 
of wit the extemporization of all dialogue, 
except a few vital lines absolutely necessary 
to the unfolding of the story, we would then 
have in nearly every essential a Commedia 
dell'Arte as it was written and produced in 
Italy during the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries. 

Now in the production of a photoplay this 
is precisely the modus operandi. That dia- 
logue obtains in the photoplay may astonish 
the uninitiated; yet not only do the actors 
speak, so that the effebt of moving lips may 
be registered, but they speak lines which re- 
flect both the character and the situation they 
are portraying. These lines, though impro- 
vised while a scene is in rehearsal, are impor- 
tant to the effective registration by the 
camera of the action, for they enable the 
actors to be "in their roles," as the French 
say, much more effectively than if pantomime 
alone were resorted to. Moreover, moving- 
picture actors seldom play without an audi- 
ence, particularly in the exterior scenes of a 
play, while during the taking of the interior 
scenes there are usually a few interlopers or 
fellow actors in the studio, to witness their 
histrionic efforts. Hence the repetition of a 
scene which the camera registers becomes not 
a rehearsal, but a performance. Again, the 
rapidity with which a scene is made by a 
competent producer, often with but one re- 
hearsal, seldom with more than two or three, 
brings the "movie" actor into close pro- 
fessional kinship with the Commedia dell'Arte 
performer, of whom Luigi Riccoboni says in 
his Histoire de I'ancien theatre italien (1730) : 

" To a comedian who depends upon improvisa- 
tion, face, memory, voice, and sentiment are not 
enough. If he would distinguish himself, he must 
possess a lively and fertile imagination, a great 
facility in expression; he must master the subtle- 
ties of the language too, and have at his disposal 
a full knowledge of all that is required for the 
different situations in which his role places him." 
In all except the phrase "he must master 
the subtleties of the language," this state- 
ment applies with equal force to the actor in 
the Improvised Comedy of the Italian renais- 
sance and the "movie" actor of to-day, only 
those actors who possess " a lively and fertile 



20

imagination, a great facility of expression, 
and a full knowledge of all that is required 
for the different situations in which their 
roles place them," being effective histrions in 
the movies. The slow, studying actor, whom 
the stage manager can by patience whip into 
a part, or the actor who depends upon read- 
ing rather than acting for his effects, will fail 
ignominiously before the camera. Indeed, 
this new histrionism calls for precisely the 
qualities of which Riccoboni speaks, with the 
added requirement that the actor must pos- 
sess a face which in the technical language of 
the "movie" studio "registers" effectively; 
more than one actor who succeeded because of 
his good looks on the regular stage has failed 
in the "movies," because his features do not 
photograph well. 

A distinctive element of the Commedia dell'- 
Arte was characterization, as exemplified by 
Pantalone, Arlecchino, Brighella, Pulcinella, 
Scaramuccia, and their merry mates, each pic- 
turing the local characteristics of some Italian 
city. These were set characters, one or more 
of whom appeared in every comedy, the plots 
being constructed around these known and 
popular roles. Although the "movies" have 
not accepted this plan of construction in its 
entirety, it nevertheless obtains, a series of 
plays having been constructed around popular 
characters, such as Bronco Billy; while John 
Bunny and Charley Chaplin might with con- 
siderable verisimilitude be dubbed the Panta- 
lone and Arlecchino of the " movies," the parts 
they have invariably filled being certainly sim- 
ilar in conception to those that bore these 
names in the Italian Improvised Comedy. 

Indeed, although the drama of to-day un- 
consciously owes much in the way of construc- 
tion to the adept dramaturgy of those nimble 
Italian actors who, schooled by experience in 
stagecraft, developed the Commedia dell' Art e, 
or professional comedy, along lines that were 
followed by Moliere and Goldoni, the "mov- 
ies " have revivified the most distinctive char- 
acteristics of that popular drama of the 
renaissance. 

The very word scenario used by the actors 
of that period survives to indicate the photo- 
play, which in form differs from those Italian 
scenari that have been preserved to us only by 
the addition of camera directions, such as 
"close up," "back to scene," "cut," "fade," 
etc., all of which are called forth by the tech- 
nical demands of photography. Although 
sprightly Arlecchino and roguish Brighella do 
not prank in the "movies" in Bergamask 
attire, their ectypes are there in modern garb ; 
while the actors who extemporize their lines, 
nimbly play before the camera in the rollick- 



ing and spontaneous way of the Commedia 
dell'Arte actors, as described by Riccoboni, 
Garzoni, Barbieri, and other contemporary 
admirers of this forgotten art. Thus it would 
appear that there is nothing entirely new 
under the dramatic sun, not even the "movies."

FINDING ONESELF IN 



Every lover of reading knows something of 
the anticipatory pleasure in opening a book 
the title of which suggests a purpose, points a 
moral, or adorns a promised tale. In the title 
of President "Wilson's little volume, "When 
a Man Comes to Himself," we have just such 
a pledge of a book with a serious meaning. 
Some books make their appeal with an entirely 
impersonal authority, as though claiming to 
be regarded as emanations from the collective 
intellect of the race, and bringing with them 
no suggestion of self -revelation. Others, again, 
seem to require for their interpretation and 
complete comprehension the conception of a 
known or unknown personality behind them. 
In this latter category we must class the book 
now under review; and we trust it may not 
seem an intrusion into the privacies of a life 
if we assume it to be something in the nature 
of an apologia pro vita, a glimpse of the inner 
workings of an heroic soul, a laying bare for 
our instruction and edification of the manner 
in which its writer has escaped from the 
stifling atmosphere of littleness and self-seek- 
ing into the upper air of universal aims where 
"our souls have sight of that immortal sea 
which brought us hither." 

The parable of the Prodigal Son has ob- 
viously suggested the title of the book; b*ut 
the author in the first few pages has made 
clear what much requires to be kept in mind, 
that it is not necessary for a man to have wan- 
dered into "a far country" or to have been 
reduced to coveting "the husks which the 
swine did eat" before reaching the point 
where he must come to himself, if his life is 
not to end in failure. The emotional upheaval 
known as " conversion " has become so soiled 
by the ignoble uses of a cheap evangelicalism 
as to have lost credit in the world of sober 
judgment ; but that some analogous change of 
attitude towards the mystery of existence and 
the meaning and uses of life must precede the 
entering upon his highest inheritance, is what 
every man in his heart probably believes. For 
even among those spiritually " impotent folk " 
who, as the author remarks, "never come to

themselves at all," who can say how many 
there are who are quite aware of the necessity 
for this change, and who may have waited 
long by the pool of Bethesda for the coming 
>of the disturbing angel that they might be the 
first to plunge into its healing waters? The 
spiritually "blind and halt and withered" 
belong to all classes of society, and are to be 
found among the wise and prudent, and in the 
very household of Mr. Worldly Wiseman of 
the town of Morality. Indeed, that this " com- 
ing to oneself" is as necessary to the man of 
genius or to him who instinctively prefers to 
walk in the paths of rectitude and veracity, as 
to the wayward child of humanity, is the les- 
son which this book seems to leave with us. 

Where one is in complete agreement with 
the main conclusions of an author, and in the 
deepest sympathy with the spirit of his writ- | 
ing, it may appear ungracious to select points 
in detail with which to disagree. As honest 
criticism, however, is the proper function of 
the critic, we must join issue with Mr. Wilson 
in one of his dicta where he affirms that the 
coming to oneself is " a change reserved for 
the thoroughly sane and healthy and for those j 
who can detach themselves," etc. Judging j 
from observation and experience, one might be j 
tempted to think that complete sanity and i 
perfect health sometimes act as a bar to the 
oncoming of the great change, and positively 
prevent a man's coming to himself. Might it 
not even be said that a little defect in health or ; 
a slight touch of insanity sometimes provides ! 
~the conditions under which the change is most ! 
likely to take place? The psychological mys- 
tery which surrounds the motions of the spirit 
is as inexplicable now as it was to the apostle 
who said : " By grace are ye saved and that 
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." For 
upon whom does the gift seem most readily to 
descend? Does it not come most frequently 
to those who are conscious of having lost some- 
thing of that healthiness and sanity which re- 
sult from complete adjustment to outward 
conditions ? May it not be that here again the 
intellectual and emotional invalids or sinners 
may have at least an equal chance to come to 
themselves, with those who have observed all 
the laws of mental and emotional hygiene ? It 
is, at all events, a more cheerful and sustaining 
TDelief that the change is not reserved for the 
thoroughly sane and healthy; as there are 
so few who can truthfully be so described. 

We believe we interpret the author's conclu- 
sions aright in assuming that he regards the 
coming of a man to himself not as a single and 
final transaction, but as a process, which hav- 
ing begun will be repeated as life unfolds its 
hidden potentialities; and that we must be 



re-born not once but many times if we are to 
expand to the full circumference of our being. 
While there are undoubtedly many to whom 
the initial awakening arrives gradually, like 
the return to consciousness of a healthy 
sleeper, to most of us it comes with more or 
less of a shock; to some with the force of a 
mighty rushing wind; to others with only a 
gentle "click" indicating that a corner has 
been rounded, an important point passed, a 
new outlook gained. But every man who has 
experienced the change and realized the 
altered perspective in which the world is seen, 
and who has received the gift in the spirit of 
true humility, will expect further revelations 
and adjustments and will not be disappointed. 
Each recurring " coming to himself " will take 
place with less shock and more and more fre- 
quency, until in a real sense he comes to him- 
self at the opening of each new day. 

On many other points most readers will find 
themselves in absolute agreement with Mr. 
Wilson. That "men come to themselves by 
discovering their limitations no less than by 
discovering their deeper endowments," that 
"Moral enthusiasm is not, uninstructed and 
of itself, a suitable guide to practicable and 
lasting reformation," and that " if the reform 
sought be the reformation of others as well as 
of himself, the reformer should look to it that 
he knows the true relation of his will to the 
wills of those he would change and guide," 
these are aphorisms of inestimable value for 
the clarification of thought and the guidance 
of the social reformer. The idea, too, that man 
reaches his highest degree of individuality 
in proportion as he identifies himself with his 
community, was surely never more happily 
expressed than in the following epigrammatic 
sentences : "A man is the part he plays among 
his fellows. He is not isolated. His life is 
made up of the relations he bears to others 
is made or marred by those relations, guided 
by them, judged by them, expressed in them." 
"Adjustment [to those relations] is exactly 
what a man gains when he comes to himself." 
Would it be possible to find a more felicitous 
elucidation of the antinomy which accepts 
Society as an organism yet insists on main- 
taining the individuality of the man ? 

"And so men grow by having responsibility 
laid upon them, the burden of other people's 
business." In these words we seem to feel the 
inner spirit of the distinguished writer of this 
edifying little book. That the burden our 
great civic chief t is at present bearing may 
react in the manner he obviously desires, will 
be the sincerest wish of every reader of "When 
a Man Comes to Himself."

[June 24 



SCORCHED WITH THE FLAMES OF WAR.* 

Of all who have gone forth to write of the 
present war for the purpose of influencing 
the opinion of the world, Mr. Sven Hedin is 
the most eminent. Educated in Germany in 
his youth, preserving through life an honest 
love for and admiration of its people in peace, 
the recipient of many honors and much ap- 
plause throughout its empire, he was allowed 
the widest latitude by no less a person than 
the Kaiser himself for the acquirement of 
such knowledge as would most convincingly 
present the cause of the German Empire to 
the neutral nations. As in so many other 
cases, he has made over his own into a Ger- 
man heart, and his large octavo volume con- 
tains no criticism of the Germans that is not 
wholly favorable. As in so many other cases, 
too, he is not satisfied to record merely what 
he sees, though he more than once professes 
that to be his object; he argues from his own 
experiences and observations to sweeping gen- 
eralities, denies all atrocities, and leaves the 
German soldier with a clean bill of moral 
health. It may be remarked here, for the. 
purpose of clearing up a great deal of muddy 
thinking in such matters, that so-called nega- 
tive testimony of this kind is not testimony 
at all. Mr. Hedin offers no contradiction, as 
an eye-witness, of the cases set forth in the 
Bedier and Bryce reports, buttressed as they 
are by extracts from the diaries of German 
soldiers ; he is content to present himself as a 
witness in the spirit in which the twenty 
friends who had not seen the Irishman steal the 
pig contradicted the ten who did. This is not 
to be held as vitiating the force of his actual 
observations; a traveller of the first distinc- 
tion and trained both to see and to write, his 
book is authoritative within its limits, and its 
faults are those of prejudgment and of mass 
psychology. But even these prejudices are 
interesting in the record, as when he notes: 
" I was told that the wounds of the Germans 
heal better and quicker than those of the

Frenchmen, whatever the reason may be." 
Again what we should call British self- 
respect and independence he characterizes as 
bad breeding: 

" Of the prisoners, it was said that there was a 
great difference between the British and the 
French. The former would stand with their hands 
in their pockets and a pipe in their mouth when 
spoken to by an officer, and a salute was only 
elicited by a reprimand. The Frenchmen, on the 
other hand, always salute the German officers 
without being told, and this is probably due to 
their inherited military spirit and to the trait of 
inborn courtesy which pervades the whole nation." 

Mr. Hedin met and talked with the Kaiser 
three times during his stay in Germany (from. 
September 14 to November 12, 1914), and 
presents this portrait of him : 

" The talk of the Emperor having aged during 
the war, and of the war with all its labors and 
anxieties having sapped his strength and health, 
is all nonsense. His hair is no more pronouncedly 
iron grey than before the war, his face has color, 
and far from being worn and thin, he is plump 
and strong, bursting with energy and rude health. 
A man of Emperor William's stamp is in his ele- 
ment when, through the force of circumstances, 
he is compelled to stake all he possesses and above- 
all himself for the good and glory of his country. 
But his greatest quality is that he is a human 
being and that with all his fulminant force he is 
humble before God." 

Mr. Hedin has convinced himself that this is 
a holy war, in which the Kaiser, like Gustavus 
Adolphus before him, is holding up the arms 
of Protestantism against what, one does 
not quite make out. After a detailed account 
of the celebration of mass near the front, he- 
writes : 

" Perhaps one ought to . . realize what Swedes 
and Germans have in common. At one time we 
gave each other the best and noblest that we pos- 
sessed. The Lutheran faith preserved by the 
sword of Gustavus Adolphus was the seed and 
life germ which has given birth to that Germanic 
culture which to-day is fighting for its existence. 
None of us can escape the responsibility for the 
inviolable preservation of the common heritage. 
Our German brethren are now shedding their 
heart's blood in a cause which in equal measure 
concerns themselves, and for which Sweden's 
greatest Kings gave their all and their lives." 

France is held to be the victim of a specious. 
and inhuman diplomacy "surely one can- 
not with self-respect refrain from loudly con- 
demning the policy which alone is the cause 
of it all." The use of Turcos and Gurkas and 
Sikhs brings forth objurgations the actual 
Turks are not mentioned. One of the inter- 
esting ways in which Germany is having the- 
cost of the war defrayed for her by her ene- 
mies is worth setting down in full : 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



"Nothing is taken away off-hand. All will be 
made good to the owners after the war. The 
terms of peace will contain a provision to the 
effect that the defeated side shall pay the amount 
of every receipt or voucher (bon) representing the 
value of the things requisitioned during the mili- 
tary occupation. The individual is not to suffer 
direct, but only as a participant in the misfortune 
which falls on the country as a whole. It is the 
duty of the State to make good the people's per- 
sonal losses when the State is incapable of pro- 
tecting the property of the individual against the 
enemy. And if the invading power is defeated 
in the war, its just punishment is that it must 
make good the losses of the sufferers." 

This reads fairly enough, but it must be 
remembered that there is nowhere in the large 
volume any hint of anything but German vic- 
tory, complete and absolute. The French who 
accept the German vouchers, having no choice 
in the matter, are to look to their own govern- 
ment for repayment for the supplies they are 
forced to give its foes. The Hague conven- 
tions are not silent on this subject, but as Mr. 
Hedin observes, "In more than one respect 
this war has demonstrated the impotence and 
futility of all conferences and conventions of 
Geneva, The Hague, and other places, bearing 
names which now have an empty and illusory 
sound." It is well to have a categorical state- 
ment of this sort from such a completely 
pro-German source. After noting the trench 
warfare in northern France, and getting to 
Antwerp just after its fall, Mr. Hedin re- 
turned home. He had been under French fire 
and the British naval bombardment of Ostend, 
had been entertained by numerous royalties 
and high dignitaries, and his tone is that of a 
man who thoroughly enjoyed himself. 

Mr. Edward Lyell Fox did not have so 
elaborate a social experience with German 
notabilities as Mr. Hedin, but his opportuni- 
ties for gaining knowledge were almost equal 
and of much the same nature. His book, 
" Behind the Scenes in Warring Germany," is 
\vritten with less reserve and more energy, 
describing conditions on both the western 
front in autumn and the eastern in winter, in 
the form of special correspondence for Amer- 
ican periodicals. Mr. Fox is much more 
guarded in his statements about German pro- 
ceedings which have not fallen under his own 
eyesight, as when he remarks in this con- 
nection : "Were every American who believes 
these Belgian stories, to live with the German 
soldiers as I have, and to know them off duty, 
and to watch them in the trenches, he would 
be utterly at sea. The stories of Belgium do 
not agree with the men of the German army." 
This is brought out by nothing more than the 
accusation that the home-loving Teuton has 



wantonly burned houses; and in the para- 
graph immediately following he describes a 
Prussian officer's bomb-proof in the trenches 
as filled with loot from a neighboring chateau 
the sort of thing that Mr. Hedin gave us 
his assurance was not done. Mr. Fox was on 
the firing line during an English charge, and 
was mightily moved to take an active part in 
the fighting, being completely carried away 
by the excitement of the moment. His ac- 
count of the defeat of the enemy must be 
given: 

" I began to notice then, by craning my head 
from left to right, that the red wavering lines of 
fire, which had a way of rushing at you and van- 
ishing to appear again further back, was [sic] 
slower now in appearing after it lost itself some- 
where in the mud, and then it became even slower 
in showing itself and finally when it came, you 
saw that it had disintegrated into segments, that 
it was no longer a steady oncoming line, rather a 
slowly squirming thing like the curling parts of 
some monstrous fiery worm that had been chopped 
to bits and was squirming its life away out there 
on the mud. And it dawned upon you in horror 
that the fiery red lines had been lines of men, 
shooting as they had come; and that, when one 
line had been mowed down, another had rushed 
up from behind, so on almost endlessly it had 
seemed until they became broken and squirmed 
like the others had done, into the mud, and came 
no more. And the spell that you had been held 
in was broken; and you remembered that there 
Avas a God, and you thanked Him that your hands 
had found nothing with which to kill." 

(It could have been wished, when Mr. Fox 
came to write, that he had remembered that 
there is also syntax in English. ) He, too, like 
Mr. Hedin, visited the prison camps in Bel- 
gium, and noted that the British did not 
salute German officers; also that when he 
asked an English marine how he liked it there, 
though an officer stood beside him, the En- 
glishman answered, "Rotten." The fighting 
in Poland was even fiercer; and the battle of 
Augustowo Wald, at which Mr. Fox was pres- 
ent, affords him material for what he calls 
" the first complete account of a great battle 
that has been told in this war." As recorded, 
it was one of those overwhelming Russian 
defeats that have characterized the eastern 
fighting, an army of 240,000 men being com- 
pletely obliterated by General von Hinden- 
berg. The last chapter in the book shows, 
with photographic reproductions, that En- 
gland possessed accurate military maps of 
Belgium, proof to the Germans that Great 
Britain intended the invasion of that un- 
happy country; and equal proof, from the 
other side, that the British were aware of 
Germany's dishonorable intentions in that 
regard. 



THE DIAL 



[ June 24 



From September to December, 1914, Mr. 
H. S. Souttar was attached to a British hos- 
pital corps and not under the personal escort 
of exceedingly polite German officers with the 
limitation of experiences thus implied. In 
consequence we are given in his book entitled 
"A Surgeon in Belgium " a record of personal 
experiences. After discussing the rules of the 
Geneva Convention the author says: 

" It is, after all, possible to fight as gentlemen. 
Or at least it was until a few months ago. Since 
then we have had a demonstration of ' scientific ' 
war such as has never before been given to man- 
kind. Now, to wear a Red Cross is simply to 
offer a better mark for the enemy's fire, and we 
only wore them in order that our own troops 
might know our business and make use of our aid. 
A hospital is a favorite mark for the German 
artillery, whilst the practice of painting Red 
Crosses on the tops of ambulance cars is by many 
people considered unwise, as it invites any passing 
aeroplane to drop a bomb. But the Germans have 
carried their systematic contempt of the rules of 
war so far that it is now almost impossible for 
our own men to recognize their Red Crosses. Time 
after time their Red Cross cars have been used to 
conceal machine-guns, their flags have floated over 
batteries, and they have actually used stretchers 
to bring up ammunition to the trenches. Whilst 
I was at Furnes two German spies were working 
with an ambulance, in khaki uniforms, bringing 
in the wounded. They were at it for nearly a 
week before they were discovered, and then, by a 
Tuse, they succeeded in driving straight through 
the Belgian lines and back to their own, Red Cross 
ambulance, khaki and all." 

Later he cites another instance that fell 
within his personal knowledge : 

" But Ypres gave us yet another example of 
German methods of war. On the western side of 
the town, some distance from the furthest houses, 
stood the Asylum. It was a fine building arranged 
in several wings, and at present it was being used 
for the accommodation of a few wounded, mostly 
women and children, and several old people of 
the workhouse infirmary type. It made a mag- 
nificent hospital, and as it was far away from 
the town and was not used for any but the pur- 
poses of a hospital, we considered it safe enough, 
and that it would be a pity to disturb the poor 
old people collected there. We might have known 
better. The very next night the Germans shelled 
it to pieces, and all those unfortunate old creatures 
had to be removed in a hurry. There was a sense- 
less barbarity about such an act which could only 
appeal to a Prussian." 

The book is both witty and wise, and the 
work of a man who can write excellent En- 
glish. It contains a number of suggestions 
of a professional sort, such as the establish- 
ment of hospitals in the country for the better 
treatment of city dwellers, and records the 
results of the use of the most modern surgical 



appliances. Madame Curie was in Mr. Sout- 
tar's hospital with her wonderful apparatus, 
and the King and Queen of Belgium were 
frequent visitors. 

Mr. Fritz Kreisler, the eminent violinist 
now touring the United States, was for a 
month on the Austrian firing line, took part 
in several engagements and a long retreat, 
was wounded in the leg, and honorably dis- 
charged from the service as no longer phy- 
sically fit for its hardships. His brief account 
of "Four Weeks in the Trenches" corrobo- 
rates those given by many others, regarding 
the ease with which a man of refinement slips 
back into the barbarism of war, with its at- 
tendant dirt and filth and lack of everything 
regarded as humanly decent. A week or two 
of marching under heavy equipment brought 
him into unexpected health and strength, as 
in so many other cases. His musical ear 
enabled him to be of service to his army, for 
it detected the differences in the sounds made 
by shells before attaining their maximum 
height and after they had begun their de- 
scent. "Apparently," he writes, " in the first 
half of its curve, that is, its course while 
ascending, the shell produced a dull whine 
accompanied by a falling cadence, which 
changes to a rising shrill as soon as the acme 
has been reached and the curve points down- 
ward again." Confiding his observations to 
his commanding officer, "it was later on re- 
ported to me that I had succeeded in giving 
to our batteries the almost exact range of the 
Russian guns." Interesting as this is, it seems 
a poor use to put a great artistic talent to. 
Several instances are cited of the men exhibit- 
ing a simple humanity toward their enemies, 
notably in a case where a Russian officer and 
his orderly came under a flag of truce to 
plead hunger, " offering a little barrel of 
water which his companion carried on his 
head and a little tobacco, in exchange for 
some provisions." The response was gener- 
ous, though the Austrians were themselves on 
scant rations, Mr. Kreisler's " proud contribu- 
tion consisting of two tablets of chocolate, 
part of a precious reserve for extreme cases." 

Mrs. M. E. Clarke has done nothing more 
than record the state of feeling suggested by 
the title of her well written book, "Paris 
"Waits : 1914," during the fearful days of the 
German advance, and by the respite that came 
in September when the French pushed their 
adversaries back to the Aisne. Of the re- 
treat immediately before, she writes: 

" I never realized how ill men could be from 
sheer fatigue until I saw a Seaforth Highlander 
and a Rifle Brigade man utterly prostrate in a 
French hospital after that awful retreat on Paris. 



1915]

They had marched twenty-five miles a day during 
four days, with practically nothing to eat, and 
fighting all the way. . . They had been in hospital 
ten days when we found them, and they were still 
unable to stand on their feet, although, beyond 
fatigue, there was nothing the matter with them. 
They craved food, rest, and forgetfulness of all 
they had seen. Their pity for the Belgian refugees 
was very real, and whatever English soldier you 
meet it is always the same : they will never forget 
those heart-rending scenes of mutilated women 
and children, burning villages, and roads stream- 
ing with frightened groups of human beings 
seeking safety by walking away from their own 
dwellings into the unknown. Above all, they will 
never forget or forgive the Germans for driving j 
the women and children before their guns as pro- 
tection for themselves against the fire of the Allies. 
Even the laconic Highlander talked about that, 
and the Rifle Brigade man became eloquent." 

Though the book makes no pretence to con- 
secutiveness or literary form, it will stand as 
a psychological cinematograph of the feelings 
of a great capital in a great historical crisis. 

M. 1'Abbe Felix Klein will be remembered 
as the author of several books which have 
been translated and sold widely in America. 
He has also travelled and lectured exten- 
sively in this country. Thus it was not inap- 
propriate that he should attach himself to the 
American 'Ambulance Corps in France as its 
chaplain. His new book, "La Guerre Vue 
d'une Ambulance," is in the form of a diary, 
running from the third of August to the last 
day of December, 1914, in which he sets down 
the actual events of each day with related 
impressions and observations. Here is con- 
firmation of Mrs. Clarke's record from an 
independent source : 

" II ne leur est permis de parler des faits de 
guerre qu'apres quinze jours ecoules. Ce n'est 
pas, jugent-ils a bon droit, desobeir a cet ordre 
que de nous confirmer, pour les avoir vues de 
leurs yeux, les atrocites des Allemands en Belgique, 
et notamment, le fait tres souvent renouvale, 
chaque fois, semble-t-il, que c'etait possible, de 
placer devant eux les enfants et les femmes, au 
moment du combat." 

There is also the protest, not uncommon in 
either France or Britain, against the use of 
similar devices: 

" Rien, pas meme le sac de Senlis, qui a donne 
lieu, rien ne justifie de pareilles explosions de 
fureur. Je sais bien que les atrocites allemandes 
depassent, cette fois, toutes limites, et qu'elles 
revetent souvent un caratere general, officiel, qui 
en augmente singulierement la portee. Mais quoi! 
n'est-ce pas eela meme qui prouve I'inferiorite de 
1'adversaire ? Loin de nous, a jamais, 1'idee de 
nous abandonner a la plus monstrueuse des emu- 
lations !" 

The impression given is vivid and sincere, 
and the United States has occasion to feel 



proud of the excellent work accomplished 
through its Ambulance Corps in France. 

Out of the obscurity thrown over the work 
of the British expeditionary force in Belgium 
and France has come from time to time the 
writings of an official eye-witness, brief and 
well worded accounts, sometimes picturesque, 
which are for the most part from the accom- 
plished pen of Colonel Ernest D. Swinton. 
These have been collected into a volume, "Eye- 
Witness's Narrative of the War," which 
needed this presentation of them since the 
exigencies of daily journalism have often led 
to omissions large and small. The accounts 
here given run from the victory of the Allies 
on the Marne to the British advance at Neuve 
Chapelle last March, the selection of the two 
events giving form to the narrative. As an 
example of the information given, the follow- 
ing statement concerning the event last named 
may be quoted : 

" One wounded Prussian officer, of a particu- 
larly offensive and truculent type which is not 
uncommon, expressed the greatest contempt for 
our methods. 'You do not fight. You murder,' 
he said. ' If it had been straightforward, honest 
fighting, we should have beaten you, but my regi- 
ment never had a chance from the first; there 
was a shell every ten yards. Nothing could live 
in such a fire.' 

" This feeling of resentment against our ar- 
tillery was shown by several of the prisoners. 
Gratifying as it is to our gunners, it is an exhibi- 
tion of a curious lack of any judicial sense or 
even of a rudimentary sense of humor on the part 
of the apostles of ' Frightfulness.' It was the 
Germans who prepared an overwhelming force of 
artillery before the war, and they were the first 
to employ the concentrated action of heavy guns 
in field warfare. When the tables are turned and 
they have their first taste of what we have so often 
eaten they actually have the effrontery to com- 
plain. It also especially galled our prisoners that 
they should have been captured by the British, 
who, they had been informed, were very inferior 
enemies." 

It was this battle that at last disclosed to the 
British the only secure method of advancing, 
and they immediately set about securing the 
necessary enormous quantity of heavy ammu- 
nition. The book pays full credit to the Ger- 
man efficiency and personal bravery, and 
some informing letters secured from prison- 
ers about the pinch of poverty are of especial 
interest. 

Miss Violetta Thurstan, an English trained 
nurse attached to the St. John of Jerusalem 
Red Cross, went to Belgium almost immedi- 
ately after the invasion of that country, re- 
mained there until the Germans deported her 
and her assistants after subjecting them to 
needless and gross personal insults, and from

Denmark passed to the Russian Red Cross at 
the flying column detailed to the front. Her 
experiences were thrilling in the extreme, and 
were borne with that high spirit of valor 
which characterizes the English gentlewoman 
at her best. Wounded at last and soon after 
stricken by pleurisy, she has occupied her 
convalescence in writing the account of her 
experiences. Her book, " Field Hospital and 
Flying Column," fully bears out the dictum 
that no autobiography is dull. Interesting as 
the narrative is, still more interesting is the 
personality of the author, which may be 
judged in part by the following extract: 

" War would be the most glorious game in the 
world if it were not for the killing and wounding. 
In it one tastes the joy of comradeship to the 
full, the taking and giving, and helping and being 
helped, in a way that would be impossible to con- 
ceive in the ordinary world. At Radzivilow, too, 
one could see the poetry of war, the zest of the 
frosty mornings, and the delight of the camp-fire 
at night, the warm, clean smell of the horses 
tethered everywhere, the keen hunger, the rough 
food sweetened by the sauce of danger, the riding 
out in high hope in the morning; even the return- 
ing wounded in the evening did not seem altogether 
such a bad thing out there." 

No idea that the pacifists have advanced is 
more convincing than that of making peace as 
interesting as warfare; once this is accom- 
plished, the vastest of all human evils will 
probably disappear. WALLACE RICE. 



RECEXT POETRY.* 

In a roughly convenient fashion, one may 
classify all contemporary verse in two grand 
divisions, according as it represents the fol- 
lowing of poetic tradition or the distinctive 
resolution to be new. In connection with the 
second group, no one interested in the subject 
can fail to be aware of a considerable amount 
of very interesting experimentation by cer- 
tain of the younger poets, analogous in a more 
than superficial way to the various modernist 
schools of painting. Even if we have serious 
suspicions as to the probable value of these 
experiments, we should try to understand

them; and for this reason it is a cause for 
satisfaction that there should be initiated a 
"New Poetry Series," designed to represent 
the work of the latest generation in small, 
well-printed volumes, modestly priced. The 
first title of this series is an anthology repre- 
senting the " imagist " poets, through the col- 
laboration of six of them, with a preface 
setting forth their principles. 

Unfortunately, when one seeks to ascertain 
the principles of any sect from its leaders, 
one is likely to be puzzled by the way in which 
they revert to obvious matters on which it is 
difficult to believe they have any peculiar 
claim. A Mormon, on being pressed for such 
a statement, will not mention polygamy or 
tithes, but will tell you that his Church is 
characterized by its belief in the coming of 
the kingdom of God on earth something 
which you supposed you had always believed 
yourself. A Seventh-day Adventist will not 
speak of the Sabbath, but will say that his 
one passion is liberty of conscience, as if this 
were a new doctrine made for the times. It 
is much the same with the modernist poets. 
The preface before us tells us that the princi- 
ples of the Imagists are five : to use the lan- 
guage of common speech, employing the exact 
and not the decorative word; to create new 
rhythms, not to copy old ones ; to allow abso- 
lute freedom in the choice of subject; to 
present an image as distinguished from vague 
generalities ; to produce poetry that is " hard 
and clear"; and to practice concentration. 
Now apart from the matter of the new 
rhythms, it is obvious that these principles 
are the commonplaces of English poetry since 
the days of Burns and of Wordsworth, when 
they are not the commonplaces of good poetry 
of every age. If we look for interpretations 
of them in the anthology itself, the matter can 
hardly be said to be cleared up. For instance, 
Mr. D. H. Lawrence gives us the following 
images in a poem alluringly called " Illicit " : 

" You are near to me, and your naked feet in their 

sandals, 

And through the scent of the balcony's naked timber 
I distinguish the scent of your hair; so now the 

limber 

Lightning falls from heaven. 
Adown the pale-green glacier-river floats 
A dark boat through the gloom and whither? 
The thunder roars. But still we have each other. 
The naked lightnings in the heaven dither 
And disappear. What have we but each other? 
The boat has gone." 

If these verses were not the product of one 
who not only is bound to employ the exact 
word, but who is under no obligation to make 
use of any rhyme whatsoever, we should be 
tempted to assume that the interesting words 
" limber " and " dither," applied to the light-

ning, were suggested by the rhyme. Being 
forbidden this hypothesis, we hesitate. As to 
the lightning's being reported as naked, when 
we should hardly have thought to ask that it 
be clothed, this may be attributed to a subtle 
sympathy with the illicit nudity of the feet 
and the timbers. But all this is so far from 
being new that it was keenly and legitimately 
parodied by Mr. Owen Seaman, years ago, in 
his ballad of the nun who 

" passed along the naked road, 
The road had really nothing on." 

Turn now, for further illustration of our 
principles, to some of the poems contributed 
"by Miss Amy Lowell, who before this has 
done praiseworthy work in poetry, and note 
images like these : 

" Little cramped words scrawling all over the paper 
Like draggled fly's legs." 

" Why do lilies goggle their tongues at me 
When I pluck them; 
And writhe, and twist, 
And strangle themselves against my fingers? " 

" My thoughts 
Chink against my ribs 
And roll about like silver hail-stones." 

Is this exactness? Is this to be concentrated, 
hard, and clear? "Well, one may not be sure 
how the words are used. But to those familiar 
with the history of English poetry it looks 
very much like a reversion, suggestive at 
times, and not without charm, to rather crude 
and youthful forms of the old method of the 
"conceit." Not to seek further light on the 
theory of the poems, we may note that their 
chief values are of the same character as 
those of a painter's jottings and sketches in 
his note-book, oftentimes suggestive of the 
materials for an interesting bit of color or of 
composition, still unformed into any signifi- 
cant whole. Here, from the work of Mr. John 
Gould Fletcher, is a view of London from a 
'bus- top : 

" Black shapes bending, 
Taxicabs crush in the crowd. 
The tops are each a shining square, 
Shuttles that steadily press through woolly fabric. . , 

" Monotonous domes of bowler-hats 
Vibrate in the heat. 

" Silently, easily we sway through braying traffic, 
Down the crowded street. 
The tumult crouches over us, 
Or suddenly drifts to one side." 

And here, from Mr. F. S. Flint, is a sketch of 
liouses at night : 

"" Into the sky 

The red earthenware and the galvanised iron chim- 
neys 

Thrust their cowls. 
'The hoot of the steamers on the Thames is plain. 



No wind; 

The trees merge, green with green; 

A car whirs by; 

Footsteps and voices take their pitch 

In the key of dust, 

Far-off and near, subdued. 

Solid and square to the world 

The houses stand, 

Their windows blocked with Venetian blinds. 

Nothing will move them." 

By far the most effective composition in the 
anthology is Miss Lowell's picture of the bom- 
bardment of a continentalcity presumably 
Rheims; but this does not even profess to be 
more than cadenced prose, and is printed 
accordingly. 

A second issue of the " New Poetry Series " 
is made up entirely of the imagistic work of 
Mr. Fletcher ; and exhibits, for the most part, 
the qualities that have been noticed. The 
following sketch is of some special interest as 
attempting the same sort of impression as that 
familiar in a certain type of painting, strewn 
broadcast with spots of prismatic color : 

" Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds; 
Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the 

street. 

" Whirlpools of purple and gold, 
Winds from the mountains of cinnabar, 
Lacquered mandarin moments, palanquins swaying 

and balancing 
Amid the vermilion pavilions, against the jade 

balustrades. 
Glint of the glittering wings of dragon-flies in the 

light : 

Silver filaments, golden flakes settling downwards, 
Rippling, quivering flutters, repulse and surrender, 
The sun broidered upon the rain, 
The rain rustling with the sun. 

" Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds ; 
Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the 
street." 

For this little volume Mr. Fletcher, like the 
editor of the anthology, has written an in- 
structive preface, explaining something of the 
doctrines of his group. It is more frank than 
the other, but singularly full of misstate- 
ments. In the brief space here available one 
must be dogmatic; hence it can only be 
shortly observed that the art of poetry in 
English-speaking countries is not in a greatly 
backward state; that the poets have not at- 
tempted to make of their craft a Masonic 
secret, declaring that rhythm is not to be 
analyzed ; that it is not true that each line of 
a poem represents a single breath ; that every 
poet of eminence has not felt the fatiguing 
monotony of regular rhyme and constructed 
new stanzas in order to avoid it; that Shake- 
speare did not abandon rhyme in his mature 
period (that is, in lyrical verse, which is ap- 
parently the only kind under consideration). 
Of course, if the reader is disposed to question 
these denials, we cannot claim to have offered

proof, he can only be referred to any schol- 
arly authority on the matters concerned. But 
if a preface like this is a specimen of the 
actual information at the disposal of the 
imagists, one can only say that their practice 
may excel their theory, but that the latter is 
beyond hope. 

Mr. Horace Holley has collected a number 
of poems which he calls not imagist but " post- 
impressionist." In form and manner they 
resemble those we have been considering, but 
are less sensuously colored and decidedly 
richer in intellectual substance. One called 
"In a Factory" rather strikingly represents 
the social aspect of the poet's thought : 

" Smoky, monotonous rows 
Of half -unconscious men 

Serving, with lustreless glance and dreamless mind, 
The masterful machines; 
These are the sons of herdsmen, hunters, 
Lords of the sunlit meadow, 
The lonely peak, 

The stirring, shadow-haunted wood, 
Of mariners who swung from sea to sea 
In carven ships 

And named the unknown world: 
Hunters, herdsmen, sailors, all 
By trade or chase or harvest 
Winning their substance 
Rudely, passionately like a worthy game 
With a boy's great zest of playing. 

O labour, 

Whoso makes thee an adventure 
Thrilling to the nervous core of life, 
He is the true Messiah, 
The world's Saviour, long-waited, long-wept-for." 

Finally, for our group of modernists, we 
may note the " Spoon River Anthology " of 
Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, which might be called 
the reductio ad absurdum of certain of the 
new methods, such as the abandonment of 
conventional form and the fearless scrutiny 
of disagreeable realities. There is nothing 
here, to be sure, of the vaporings of some of 
our imagists, but a stern virility to which one 
might warm were it not so deliberately un- 
lovely. The contents of this " anthology " is 
a series of monologues d'outre tonibe, sup- 
posed to be spoken by the inhabitants of the 
Spoon Eiver cemetery, who one by one tell us 
something of what they did and felt while 
living, and in many cases how they met their 
end. Whether Spoon River is meant to be 
viewed as typical of Illinois villages for it 
appears to be in the vicinity of Knox College 
and Peoria or to be a place peculiarly 
accursed, doth not clearly appear. In either 
case it furnishes an extraordinary study, in 
mortuary statistics. From the first half of 
the volume, or thereabouts, there may be 
culled such characters as these : a person who 
was hanged for highway robbery and murder ; 
a woman who was slain by the secret cruelty 
of her husband, the details not revealed; an 



inventor who was bitten by a rat while dem- 
onstrating a patent trap ; a woman who took 
morphine after a quarrel with her husband;, 
another who died in childbirth, the event hav- 
ing been foreseen by her husband; a boy 
who was run over while stealing a ride on a 
train; another boy who contracted lockjaw 
from a toy pistol; a woman whose lock jaw was 
due to a needle which had pierced her while 
she was washing her baby's clothes; a citi- 
zen who fell dead, presumably from apoplexy, 
while confessing a hidden sin to his church; 
a trainer who was killed by a lion in a circus; 
a greedy farmer who died from eating pie and: 
gulping coffee in hot harvest time; a rural 
philosopher who was gored by a cow while- 
discussing predestination; an innocent man 
who was hanged on a trumped-up charge; a 
courtesan who was poisoned by an Italian 
count; and a prohibitionist who developed' 
cirrhosis of the liver from over-drinking. 
Enough though the half has not been told. 
Under most of these tragedies lurk a grim 
pathos, and an irony due to such causes as the- 
total misunderstanding by his fellows of the 
life (and often the death) of the ghostly 
speaker. A really remarkable series of char- 
acter-studies, though the half would be much 
better than the whole; but for poetry GUI 
bono ? Mr. Masters has shown before this that 
he knows what verse is ; how then can he per- 
petrate, and endure to see in type, trash like- 
this: 

" If even one of my boys could have run a news-stand, 
Or one of my girls could have married a decent man,. 
I should not have walked in the rain 
And jumped into bed with clothes all wet, 
Refusing medical aid." 

(In passing, note this method of suicide, per- 
haps the most original, because the most indi- 
rect, of those described in the collection.) It 
can only be because he was resolved to por- 
tray in the words of one of his own char- 
acters a " wingless void 

Where neither red, nor gold, nor wine, 
Nor the rhythm of life are [sic] known." 

In two or three of the monologues only is the 
rhythm of life heard sounding underneath the 
tragedy as it always is in actual poetry and 
real tragedy ; in the words of Petit the Poet :; 

" Tragedy, comedy, valor and truth, 
Courage, constancy, heroism, failure 
All in the loom, and oh what patterns! 
Woodlands, meadows, streams and rivers 
Blind to all of it all my life long. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, what little iambics, 
While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines!" 

All this formless, blundering, but seriously- 
purposed waiting, under whatever name it

goes, is of value to the thoughtful reader for 
inferential and negative rather than positive 
reasons. Practically all the compositions at 
"which we have been looking fail to meet the 
eternal test of poetry: they would perform 
their function, express their image or their 
thought, as well in prose form as in verse, 
sometimes better. What does this signify? 
Their prefaces do not tell us. The real char- 
acteristic common to the group is the delib- 
erate abandonment of faith in a type, a law, 
an ideal call it what you will to which 
the fleeting momentary experiences caught up 
by the poet are to be referred, and of which 
his dependence on a persistent form, a stead- 
ily flowing, ineluctable rhythm, is but a sym- 
bol. Some will cling to form, but throw away 
the idea for which it stands; some will cling 
to beauty of detail, but abandon beauty of 
the whole; some will keep their sense of the 
type, the law, the idea, but throw away out- 
ward form, just for the zest of difference and 
novelty. When they abandon all faith and 
form together then we have a complete and 
instructive pathologic specimen of the process. 
What remains may be called poetry, but it 
is a poetry like that religion which has aban- 
doned both religion's ritual and its faith. 

Mr. Thomas Hardy is of those who keep the 
ritual without the faith. In other words, 
whether in prose or in verse, he holds to the 
traditional forms of his art despite the hope- 
less and unbeautiful creed which is familiar 
to all his readers. In his early volume of 
verse, the "Wessex Poems," he somewhere 
expressed himself to this effect: that life 
would be more tolerable if we could believe 
ourselves to be in the toils of a malicious 
power, bent on causing suffering, it would 
at any rate be a more rational state than to 
feel that our suffering is without either pur- 
pose or meaning. In later years, as every- 
one knows, he has achieved the satisfaction 
merely dreamed of in the poem referred to, 
and come to something like a solemn faith in 
a Power not ourselves that makes for un- 
righteousness. This gives a kind of ideality 
to his pessimism which is quite wanting in the 
insignificant disillusioned ghosts of Spoon 
River. His recent volume of collected poems 
represents this in many a passage, but in none 
so nobly as in the lines on the loss of the 
"Titanic" (called "The Convergence of the 
Twain") : 

"... Well, while was fashioning 

This creature of cleaving wing, 

The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything 

" Prepared a sinister mate 

For her so gaily great 
A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate. 



" And as the smart ship grew 

In stature, grace, and hue, 
In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too. 

" Alien they seemed to be : 
No mortal eye could see 
The intimate welding of their later history, 

" Or sign that they were bent 

By paths coincident 
On being anon twin halves of one august event, 

" Till the Spinner of the Years 

Said ' Now ! ' And each one hears, 
And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres." 

The title poems of the volume, called " Satires 
of Circumstance," are brilliant ironic sketches 
in precisely the mordant manner of Mr. 
Hardy's most disconcerting prose narrative. 
Quite as keen, and perhaps even more finely 
balanced in respect to comedy and tragedy, is 
the neighboring dialogue between a buried 
woman and some one digging on her grave. 
At first she imagines it to be her lover plant- 
ing rue, but the answer comes, "No, he 
wedded another yesterday." "My nearest 
kin, then ? " " No, they are saying, ' What 
use to plant flowers?" "My enemy, then, 
prodding maliciously ? " " No, she thinks you 
no more worth her hate." " Who is it, then ? " 
"Your little dog, my mistress dear." "Ah, 
one true heart left behind I might have 
known." But the dog answers: 

" Mistress, I dug upon your grave 

To bury a bone, in case 
I should be hungry near this spot 
When passing on my daily trot. 
I am sorry, but I quite forgot 

It was your resting-place." 

It seemed well to paraphrase the greater por- 
tion of this little narrative, not merely for the 
sake of brevity, but to exemplify the fact that 
this is a type of composition, again, which 
does not lose its essence when transferred to 
prose. The verse points it, to be sure, gives 
finish and consequent satisfaction; but the 
spirit is not that of poetry, because the spirit 
of poetry is never that of mere negation. 
And this is true of a great part of Mr. Hardy's 
verse. But there are plenty of exceptions, as 
in the poem on the " Titanic," where, as we 
have seen, a big and looming imaginative con- 
cept rises from the very ruins of faith. 

In marked contrast to all these modernists 
is a new volume of poems representing the 
spiritual philosophy of Mr. Henry Bryan 
Binns. Some of the verse seems modern 
enough, to be sure; some of it is in vers 
libre; but Mr. Binns is not under the illu- 
sion that he is contributing, in these irregular 
forms, to the normal evolution of the poetry 
of the race. He values them, sagaciously, 
only as means of expressing certain personal 
"realisations," such as, in some cases, recall 



30 



THE DIAL 



[ June 24 



the ecstatic utterances of seventeenth century 
mystics like Traherne. From " High Noon," 
for instance, is this : 

" See the sun atop, crowning Noon's height, 
Level beneath him the round world! 
Level lies earth beneath and takes to the brim 
Her full of him, ere, tilting to East 
The light begins spilling. 

" While Noon's now at full 
Brim-high with this effulgence of light, 
Who has heart, come, drain it ! 
Who has faith, let him drink! " 

Of conventional forms, there are many son- 
nets in the volume, but in this form Mr. Binns 
tends to be didactic and unimaginative. His 
happiest vein is perhaps exemplified in cer- 
tain verses in the four-foot measure, which 
has often been proved to have possibilities for 
the combination of thoughtful epigram with 
lyrical feeling. Of this character is the fine 
conclusion to the title poem : 

" Whatever of myself I win 
Out of my peril or despair, 
With all the inseparable kin 
And pilgrimage of life, I share. 

" Alone in the light the skylark sings 
And sets us singing in the gloom : 
I, also, on victorious wings 
An instant overleap my doom: 

" And though I know not how, I know 
As Earth, whereof we spring, is one, 
So every spirit's overflow 
Eeplenishes the common sun." 

The Emersonian flavor evident in these lines 
is still more noticeable in the lighter vein of 
"The Scolding Squirrel." There remains 
space for only two or three stanzas of this: 

" Squirrel, squirrel up in the tree, 
While you jerk that tail at me 
I mock at you and blithely dine 
On the other fruit of the pine. . . . 

" All about me for my food 
Drops the wisdom of the wood : 
What a thousand pine-trees think 
Is distilled to be my drink. . . . 

" An ever-living tide of mirth 
That flows for aye about the Earth 
Begins to sing its song in me, 
Squirrel, underneath your tree." 

We return to America for a volume which 
should have found earlier notice in these col- 
umns, Mr. Arthur Ficke's sequence of "Son- 
nets of a Portrait-Painter." Mr. Ficke's work 
in the sonnet has won many a friendly word 
before now, and the new collection marks 
progress in his art. The sequence is a genu- 
ine one, with dramatic values over and above 
the lyrical ones, such as every such work must 
have to give it unity. Unfortunately this 
element is not developed as effectively as the 
opening portion of the series gives warrant 
for hoping. There the character of the painter 



and that of his environment come out with 
some vividness, and the poet is not afraid to 
heighten these with homely and humorous 
realism, as in this admirable quatrain, from 
Sonnet 5 : 

" Heaven knows what moonlit turrets, hazed in bliss, 
Saw Launcelot and night and Guinevere! 
I only know our first impassioned kiss 
Was in your cellar, rummaging for beer." 

But of this distinctness there seems not to be 
enough. At least one is not without fears, 
though the painter does live and grow 
throughout the sequence, that he sometimes 
draws from his portfolio a sonnet on things, 
in general, which might have been written by 
poets in general, as distinguished from him- 
self. Nevertheless, there have been few more 
successful experiments in this difficult type 
in recent times. Mr. Ficke uses the English 
or Shakespearean form of sonnet, with a vivid 
sense of its characteristic movement, which 
is less generally understood in our day than 
that of the "Italian" form. Even Shake- 
speare seems frequently not to have troubled 
to make his final couplet more than a tag or 
appendix to a lyric already complete in twelve 
lines. This tendency Mr. Ficke avoids with 
skill. The movement and unity of his lyric 
may be represented by the rapturous love- 
sonnet, Number 20 : 

" Ah, life is good ! And good thus to behold 
From far horizons where their tents are furled 
The mighty storms of Being rise, unfold, 
Mix, strike, and crash across a shaken world: 
Good to behold their trailing rearguards pass, 
And feel the sun renewed its sweetness send 
Down to the sparkling leaf-blades of the grass, 
And watch the drops fall where the branches bend. 
I think to-day I almost were content 
To hear some bard life's epic story tell, 
To view the stage through some small curtain-rent, 
Mere watcher at this gorgeous spectacle. 
But now the curtain lifts: my soul's swift powers 
Else robed and crowned for lo! the play is ours! J>

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

The author of "The Hat Shop," Mrs. C. S. 
Peel, seems to promise a work of the same kind 
in her later novel, "Mrs. Barnet Robes" (Lane), 
but there is considerable difference. The titular 
character is deserted, with a small daughter, by 
the gentleman she loves, and after hard work 
establishes herself as a dressmaker of fashion. 
He marries in his own class after a time, and his 
first child is a daughter. The narrative divides 
itself fairly between the two girls, who meet with- 
out knowledge of any relationship, but with 
recognition of an unusual personal resemblance. 
The marriage is unfortunate, and the legitimate 
daughter grows up in an atmosphere of tragical 
misunderstanding, while the other develops in a

humbler walk of life into a happiness entirely 
normal. It is a study of environments, thoughtful 
and carefully considered. 

Such a book as "His English Wife" (Long- 
mans), translated by Mr. A. C. Curtis from the 
German of Herr Rudolph Stratz, is bound to have 
more than fictional value at the present time, 
written as it was before the outbreak of the war. 
It was widely popular in Germany, and has 
reached a second edition in England. It describes 
the difficulties attending the married life of a 
young German officer and a young English girl 
whose father was born in Frankfort. It is just 
to Herr Stratz to say that he has contended 
against the usual impulse to set one's countrymen 
a pace or two forward while the foreigner takes 
two steps to the rear. The capture of English 
trade by Germany, one of the industriously ex- 
ploited fictions of the time, bears no small share 
in the story. 

James Hay, Jr., has brought the " temperance " 
tract fairly up to the compass of a novel in " The 
Man Who Forgot " (Doubleday). The protagonist 
has steeped himself in drink until he emerges 
from his last debauch absolutely forgetful of his 
past and with no clue to his identity. Determined 
to overthrow the Demon Rum in revenge, as well 
as for the benefit supposed to enure, he enlists 
the resources of two millionaires whose sons have 
turned out drunkards, organizes a nation-wide 
demonstration at the Capital, and secures thereby 
the adoption by Congress of a constitutional 
amendment forbidding the importation, manufac- 
ture, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Incidentally 
he gains a desirable wife and comes to a knowledge 
of his earlier life; but the propaganda, as usual 
in such books, outweighs the romance of the tale. 

Mr. Jack London seems determined to prove 
that fiction can be stranger than fact, in spite of 
warring Europe's example to the contrary, and 
" The Scarlet Plague " (Macmillan) is a doughty 
effort to that end. By a world-wide epidemic, 
humanity is almost obliterated from the world, 
and the few who outlast the scourge are selected 
without reference to the survival of the fittest. 
The story is placed in the mouth of a former pro- 
fessor of a Californian university, transformed 
into " a dirty old man clad in goatskins." Mankind 
is placed at the foot of the ladder once more, to 
begin a toilsome ascent, and the grandchildren of 
the survivors are depicted on the plane of the 
Digger Indians. It is difficult to be sympathetic 
with such a story; the realities are sufficiently 
ghastly nowadays. 

Civilization is at present so shaken by calamity 
that cataclysmic stories seem necessary if fiction 
is to make itself as absorbing as the daily news- 
paper tale of slaughter and destruction. Accord- 
ingly, Mr. Arthur Train has written " The Man 
Who Rocked the Earth" (Doubleday) to show 
that science may still have a few things up its 
sleeve to add to the horrors of daily living; but 
he reconciles his readers by invoking this awful 
power on the side of peace. He makes the old 
dream of Archimedes come true by giving the 



mysterious " Pax " of his narrative an electric 
lever which shifts the earth's axis, and promises 
to twist it further around if the nations do not 
stop fighting. It is an absorbing tale, made plaus- 
ible in the face of evident difficulties. 

Mystery, complicated by theosophy, makes " The 
Brocklebank Riddle" (Century Co.), by Mr. 
Hubert Wales, a puzzling story indeed. After a 
man's wife and his partner have seen him die, 
and one of them has seen his body cremated, he 
appears at his office. The situation becomes more 
and more strained when a woman whose husband 
has disappeared without warning comes to inquire 
after him. Brocklebank himself is puzzled, but 
dismisses all thought of anything supernatural. 
The last pages of the book solve the riddle as 
ingeniously as the earlier pages proposed it. 



Two German 
apologists. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

In General von Bernhardi's 
"Germany and England" (Dil- 
lingham), the erstwhile lion of 
militarism roars you as gently as any sucking 
dove. Americans are sufficiently familiar 
with the doughty general's stout defence of 
war as a biological necessity and a moral and 
political tonic. They will now be amazed to 
learn from this little book, which is intended 
for American consumption, that the author 
never meant to say the things one finds in his 
earlier volumes, or that somehow, as the Ger- 
man Chancellor implied of his own unlucky 
"scrap of paper" phrase, he "had his fingers 
crossed " when he did say them. War is here 
justified only when peaceful means have 
failed, and of course Germany had exhausted 
all such means last summer before the plunge 
was taken. The earlier Bernhardi had the 
merit of candor; the present Bernhardi is an 
unpalatable mixture of disingenuousness and 
naivete. He is disingenuous in attempting to 
explain away his own sincere utterances, and 
he is naive in supposing that people will be 
fooled by that attempt. Like most of the 
German apologists, including even the dear 
departed Dr. Dernburg, he grievously under- 
estimates the intelligence of the Am;erican 
public. The book also comes at a most inop- 
portune moment, just when pro-Germans in 
this country have been doing their best to dis- 
avow and forget Bernhardi and all his ways. 
A somewhat better statement of the German 
case is to be found in Dr. Paul Rohrbach's 
" Germany's Isolation" (McClurg), which has 
been well translated by Dr. Paul H. Phillip- 
son. Nevertheless, readers of the same au- 
thor's "German World Policies" (reviewed 
in THE DIAL for April 15 last) will be dis- 
appointed. The book, though written for the 
most part before the present struggle began, 



32 



THE DIAL 



[ June 24 



was evidently composed in the shadow of com- 
ing events. The tone is aggressive, and even 
menacing; it fairly vibrates with the note of 
approaching conflict, thus unconsciously fur- 
nishing interesting testimony to the state of 
mind of some observant Germans in the 
months before the war broke out. An intro- 
duction and a final chapter have been added 
by Dr. Rohrbach since the opening of hostili- 
ties. In the latter he appears as an apologist 
for all of his country's acts: Germany was 
not the assailant, the Kaiser strove almost un- 
duly to keep the peace, the invasion of Bel- 
gium was justified because England violated 
Danish neutrality in 1807, etc. Yet the sig- 
nificant admission is made that it is difficult 
to think of " a phase more favorable to the 
German cause than the present alignment of 
Germany's forces and those of her opponents." 
The book closes with the inevitable denuncia- 
tion of England as the one unpardonable foe. 
'The stereotyped nature of German thinking on 
the war has scarcely ever been more patheti- 
cally revealed than in this volume by an 
intelligent publicist whose mind in normal 
times has not lacked proper elasticity. 



The story of From the early summer of 1843 
a short-lived to the following mid-winter, a 
little company of "consecrated 
cranks," as they have since been called by the 
irreverent, strove to realize the higher life and 
to set an example to the rest of the world by 
practising, on a farm at Harvard, Massachu- 
setts, the principles of strict vegetarianism, 
"brotherly love, simplicity and sincerity, and 
other virtues with next to nothing in the 
way of material resources whereby to prevent 
this life of the spirit from becoming as inde- 
pendent of the body in actual fact as it was 
in ideal and aspiration. But the rigors of a 
New England winter proved too severe a trial 
of their faith to these apostles of "the New- 
ness," in their linen tunics and canvas shoes, 
and unsustained by more invigorating diet 
than a fast-diminishing ration of barley; and 
so the high-hearted enterprise of ushering in 
the millennium on a regimen of cereals and 
water came to a premature end. "Bronson 
Alcott's Fruitlands" (Houghton) rehearses 
the pathetic tale of this adventure in spir- 
ituality. Miss Clara Endicott Sears, a 
dweller upon the hill overlooking the scene of 
the undertaking, has compiled, in a spirit 
of mingled "pity, awe, and affection," this 
account of the " Consociate Community " 
founded by Alcott, with his long-suffering 
wife and his four daughters, and a half-score 
of more or less earnest and ascetic souls from 
different quarters of the globe. Letters and 



diaries, including the bits of journals kept by 
two of the Alcott girls, Anna and Louisa, 
with other contemporary records, have been 
diligently searched and judiciously utilized 
by Miss Sears, who has also added, by permis- 
sion. Miss Alcott's ever-entertaining " Trans- 
cendental Wild Oats," and has given in an 
appendix the very interesting " catalogue of 
the original Fruitlands library," about a 
thousand volumes brought from England by 
Alcott and his friend Charles Lane, and de- 
scribed in "The Dial" of that time as "con- 
taining undoubtedly a richer collection of 
mystical writers than any other library in 
this country." Views of the Fruitlands house, 
exterior and interior, with portraits of the 
Alcotts and other inmates, are abundantly 
supplied. To readers of discernment the book 
will commend itself as a veritable treasure. 



avic work most rec ently published 

of women volume in the "National Mu- 

nicipal League Series" (Apple- 
ton) is Mrs. Mary Ritter Beard's "Woman's 
Work in Municipalities." The original plan 
of the author was to present simply a col- 
lection of readings illustrating the various 
phases of her subject. It was found, how- 
ever, that there are not in existence docu- 
mentary materials adapted to the purpose, 
and consequently the chapters of the book 
were written out by the author herself, with 
free use of passages from reports, correspon- 
dence, newspaper comment, and other scat- 
tered "sources." The result is a volume 
covering every important aspect of the civic 
work of women in this country in the past 
quarter-century, notably in relation to educa- 
tion, public health, recreation, housing, cor- 
rections, the social evil, the assimilation of 
races, and public safety. The fourfold pur- 
pose of the book is explained by the author 
to be : (1) to give something like an adequate 
notion of the extent and variety of women's 
interests and activities in cities and towns, 
without attempting a statistical summary or 
evaluation; (2) to indicate, in their own- 
words, the spirit in which women have ap- . 
proached some of their most important prob- 
lems; (3) to show to women already at work 
and those just becoming interested in civic 
matters, the interrelation of each particular 
effort with larger social problems; and (4) 
to reflect the general tendencies of modern 
social work as they appear under the guidance 
of men and women alike. It may be said that, 
in the main, these praiseworthy objects are 
accomplished. Information concerning thei 
civic activities of women, in smaller towns no 
less than in the great cities, is brought to- 



1915]

gether from widely scattered quarters, sifted, 
digested, correlated, and presented in form 
both unassuming- and convincing. And the 
temptation (which must have been strong) so 
to stress the part played by women in civic 
betterment as to produce an incorrect impres- 
sion has been resisted. 



Our literature 
estimated by 
a foreigner. 



Of considerable interest for the 
opportunity it gives of seeing 
ourselves as others see us is the 
little book on "American Literature " (Double- 
day), by Professor Leon Kellner of the Uni- 
versity of Czernowitz, translated by Miss 
Julia Franklin. Professor Kellner's estimates 
of the greater American writers and their 
works are, on the whole, those with which we 
are familiar; though it seems strange, for 
example, to find no mention of the Harvard 
" Commemoration Ode " when three of Low- 
ell's lesser odes are praised. The peculiarities 
of the work are found chiefly in the attention 
bestowed on a.uthors who, at home, are consid- 
ered " minor," but who to the foreign observer 
are especially significant. Eugene Field and 
C. G. Leland are each given as much space as 
Bryant ; and the former, who is highly praised, 
almost as much space as Whittier. Emily 
Judson, H. C. Dodge, and A. W. Bellow are 
among the names which appear in Professor 
Kellner's book, and are not commonly found 
in native histories of our literature. For these 
judgments of a distant observer, even those 
which seem most erratic, there are conceivable 
reasons which the American student would do 
well to ponder. Statements of fact are mostly 
accurate, but unfortunately the book abounds 
in crude misprints of proper names which 
might have been avoided if translator or 
proofreader had been even moderately famil- 
iar with American literary history. Typical 
of such blunders are "Hannah W. Forster" 
(p. 9), "Quabi" (p. 21), "Natty Bumppo" 
(p. 33), "Duyckink" (p. 147), "Edgar Allen 
Poe" (p. 159), " The Facts in the Case of M. 
Waldemar" (p. 165) the last evidently the 
result of a double transliteration. On page 
47, " Expostulation " and " Massachusetts to 
Virginia" seem, either through a.n error or 
through awkwardness of the English sentence, 
to be credited to Bryant. 



The development 
ofaninfant 

phenomenon. 



what is "Natural Education " ? 
If we are to accept the view of 

.-, ,-, /, -,, TIT- / -i 

the mother of Miss Winifred 
Sackville Stoner, Jr., whose account of her 
daughter's training is published under that 
title by the Bobbs-Merrill Company, in the 
" Childhood and Youth Series," it is a " natu- 
ral education " for a girl to be lulled to sleep 



by the hexameters of Virgil when six weeks 
old, to know one forgets how many languages 
at five, to have written a play in Esperanto at 
four, to have kept a carefully written diary 
from the age of two, and to have convinced 
" an old-fashioned Professor " at five that she 
" knew all the famous myths handed down by 
the Grecians, Romans and Vikings," etc., etc. 
After reading the pages which tell of her 
knowledge of Latin, another " old-fashioned 
Professor" is tempted to suggest that if this 
little girl really knows Latin it is a pity that 
she was not called upon to read the proof of 
this volume and correct the sad blunders in 
Latin words and sentences which have passed 
unchallenged the eyes of her mother, who 
taught her the language and wrote the book, 
and of Professor O'Shea, the general editor of 
the series. The average parent who reads the 
book will scarcely conclude that the kind of 
education which it describes is either natural 
or desirable. And yet Professor O'Shea boldly 
challenges comparison of the book with Rous- 
seau's " Emile," claiming for it a style fully as 
attractive as that of the French classic, and 
the advantage of being an account of what has 
actually been accomplished, rather than an 
exposition of what an educational theorist 
thinks desirable. " It is not beyond reason," 
he adds, " to expect that the present volume 
will do for the practise of teaching at home 
and in the school what ' Bmile ' has done for 
the theory of education." Prophecy, of course, 
can be met only with counter prophecy; but 
the style of written books is open to inspection, 
and .Professor O'Shea will search long for a 
disinterested and competent critic to agree 
with him in the dictum that the style of this 
volume is on a level with that of Rousseau, or 
of any other fairly competent master of 
French prose, an instrument of expression 
which no other modern tongue equals save in 
very rare instances. 



The noblest of the arts, in the 
opinion of the late Governor 
Altgeld, is oratory. A new 
printing of his little book on " Oratory," 
which originally appeared in 1901, now comes 
from the press with this year's date on its 
title-page. In discussing the principles of 
public speaking the author falls little short 
of poetic fervor in praise of the oratorical gift. 
" Oratory," he declares, " is an individual 
accomplishment, and no vicissitudes of for- 
tune can wrest it from the owner. It points 
the martyr's path to the future ; it guides the 
reaper's hand in the present, and it turns the 
face of ambition toward the delectable hills 
of achievement. One great speech made to 



34 



THE DIAL 



[ June 24 



an intelligent audience in favor of the rights 
of man will compensate for a life of labor, 
will crown a career with glory and give a joy 
that is born of the divinities." Like Demos- 
thenes, Mr. Altgeld makes " action," or deliv- 
ery, the first, second, and third requisite of 
oratory. Admirable, and not exactly to be 
expected from an effective public speaker, is 
his insistence on literary excellence as a prime 
essential of good oratory. "Literary excel- 
lence is the robe of immortality without which 
no speech can live." True, but many an un- 
literary and even illiterate harangue has 
wrought powerfully upon its hearers. Not 
without autobiographic interest and meaning 
is the following concerning the orator of, 
unselfish purpose: "If he would reach the 
highest estate possible on this earth he must 
stand resolutely with his face toward the sun ; 
and when the cry of oppressed humanity calls 
for sacrifice he must promptly say, 'Here, 
Lord, am I.' " The greatest orators have not 
seldom been the champions of lost causes, as 
the writer notes, and " defeat is often the 
baptism of immortality." A lofty idealism 
reveals itself on almost every page of this 
remarkable little treatise, and nowhere more 
clearly than in the assertion that " isolation is 
the price of greatness, and the stars are all 
the friends an orator needs." The book is 
issued by " The Public," Ellsworth Building, 
Chicago. 

The short monograph by Dr. C. 
Germany and Snouck Hurgronje, of Leiden 

the " Holy War." ..,. ., ...-, -, r TT i 

University, entitled " The Holy 
War: Made in Germany" (Putnam), is in- 
tended to clear up misconceptions as to the 
nature of a jihad or " holy war." Following 
the coup d'etat by which Germany dragged 
hesitant Turkey into the war last October 
came the proclamation of the jihad, by which 
Germany hoped to incite all Moslems to a 
general attack on Great Britain and France. 
That the attack failed to ensue is now a matter 
of common knowledge. Dr. Hurgronje ex- 
plains the reasons, and shows how German 
expectations were based on ignorance. Ac- 
cording to Islamic doctrine, no wars are per- 
missible except those against the infidels, and 
every such war is a jihad. But modern Turkey 
is mainly made up of Christians, and, con- 
versely, the majority of Mohammedans are 
citizens of other countries. Moreover, not 
only is there no political unity in the modern 
Moslem world, but even the Caliphate or 
central religious authority of the Ottoman Em- 
pire is no longer recognized. Hence the mis- 
calculations of Germany in trying to revive a 
mediaeval institution so hopelessly out of place 
in the world of to-day. 



NOTES. 



The Hope of the Family" is the title of a 
novel of the present war by Mr. and Mrs. Egerton 
Castle, announced by Messrs. Appleton. 

Early in September " Jane Clegg," the first 
play by Mr. St. John Ervine to be published in 
this country, will be issued by Messrs. Holt. 

A volume of " Sonnets of the Empire before and 
during the Great War," by Mr. Archibald T. 
Strong, will soon come from the press of Messrs. 
Macmillan. 

A new edition of an early volume by Mr. Have- 
lock Ellis, "Affirmations," is promised for early 
publication. It will contain an important new 
preface written by the author. 

" Germany's Violation of the Laws of War," a 
report prepared under the direction of the French 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is in train for early 
publication by Messrs. Putnam. 

A play of old Japan, entitled " The Faithful : 
A Tragedy in Three Acts," by Mr. John Masefield, 
is announced. The period chosen is that of the 
beginning of the eighteenth century. 

Before the end of the month the fourth volume 
of " Glimpses of the Cosmos," the series including 
the collected essays of the late Lester F. Ward, 
will be published by Messrs. Putnam. This vol- 
ume will contain the contributions the author 
made during his prime from his forty-fourth 
to his fifty-second year. 

Mr. Frederic Harrison has collected his scat- 
tered writings on the relations of Germany and 
Britain, covering a period of fifty years, in a 
volume to be published under the title of " The 
German Peril." The book is divided into three 
sections, the first entitled " Forecasts, 1864-1914," 
the second "Realities, 1915," and the third 
" Hopes, 191." 

An anthology entitled " Literary California," 
made up of selections in prose and verse from 
writers identified with the Pacific West, is an- 
nounced for early publication by Mr. John J. New- 
begin of San Francisco. The compiler is Mrs. Ella 
Sterling Mighels, author of " The Story of the 
Files." Biographical sketches and portraits of 
the writers represented, bibliographical data, and 
a full index will add much to the value of the 
work. 

A new series of biographies is in prospect, the 
project being the joint venture of Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. and Messrs. Constable & Co. of 
London. It will be entitled " Makers of the Nine- 
teenth Century," and will be edited by Mr. Basil 
Williams. Each volume is to contain the life of a 
man or woman who has had an influence on the 
century. The three titles scheduled for publica- 
tion this fall are, "John Delane," by Sir E. T. 
Cook; "Abraham Lincoln," by Lord Charnwood; 
and "Herbert Spencer," by Mr. Hugh S. Elliot. 
Biographies of Cecil Rhodes, Victor Hugo, Lord 
Shaftesbury, and General Lee are in preparation.

from time to time, giving information chiefly as 
to recent accessions, with occasional items of wider 
interest, as, for example, in the October issue, a 
brief history of the library from the formation of 
the American Circulating Library Association of 
Manila, in memory of American soldiers and sail- 
ors killed or wounded in the Philippines an or- 
ganization from which the present one had its 
origin down through the transfer of the insti- 
tution to the government in 1901, its incorporation 
with the Bureau of Education in 1905, its trans- 
formation by legislative act into its present con- 
dition (except as to fees) in 1909, and the entire 
removal of fees last July. In that and the fol- 
lowing month about two thousand cards were 
issued, two-thirds of them to Filipinos. In the 
reading-room the proportion of native readers is 
between seventy and eighty per cent. 

Publication of a second series of classics in 
science and philosophy has been begun by the 
Open Court Publishing Co. The first series, en- 
titled " The Religion of Science Library," was 
begun just after the World's Columbian Exposi- 
tion held in Chicago in 1893. Its purpose was 
to put the study of religion on a scientific basis, 
and was the direct outcome of the founding of the 
Open Court Publishing Company by the late 
Edward C. Hegeler of La Salle, 111. He was very 
much interested in the Religious Parliament idea, 
the first meeting of which was called the World's 
Congress of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893. 
This series deals largely with the philosophy of 
religion. It now numbers seventy volumes. The 
second series will consist of reprints of classics 
marking the historical development of science and 
philosophy. The first volume of the series is still 
in preparation; but the second volume, made up 
of " Selections from the Scottish Philosophy of 
Commonsense," has just appeared. In thus mak- 
ing available in convenient and inexpensive form 
the classics of philosophic thought, the publishers 
are rendering a service that should be widely 
appreciated.

MY DEAR SIR: 

Having just returned to Washington, I 
find a copy of your book entitled Retrospec- 
tion, and hasten to thank you for it. I am 
reading it with very great interest. 
The light y9u throw upon much of 
the early history of California at 
the time of the first American 
occupation of the country, as well 

as upon the early history of the Mormons, is new to me 
and of the highest value and interest. It tempts me 
indeed to wish that you had found it possible to enter 
even more fully into details regarding the events and 
the characters of those stirring times. 

Believe me, with renewed thanks, Very faithfully yours,

GENTLEMEN: 

I have been very much inter-

spection, which gives a very vivid 
picture of a side of California 

life about which we know far too little and have far too 
little material, namely the actual upbuilding of the 
community in the face of economic and political diffi- 
culties. It is a permanent source in the history of 
California. Very truly yours,

Two Very Important New Books 

De Morgan's Budget of Paradoxes 

By AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN 
Edited with Full Bibliographical Notes and Index 

By DAVID EUGENE SMITH 

Teachers' College, Columbia University, New York 
Author of Kara Arithmetica, Portfolio of Eminent Mathematicians, etc., etc. 

THE BUDGET OP PARADOXES. As a piece of delicious satire upon the efforts of circlers of 
squares, and their kind, there is nothing else in English literature that is quite so good as the delightful 
Budget of Paradoxes of Augustus de Morgan. While absolutely scientific in its conclusions, the work is not 
technical, but is written in a popular style which any one can appreciate. 

THE PRESENT EDITION. Many names which were common property in England when this 
work was first published 50 years ago, and incidents which were subjects of general conversation then 
have long since been forgotten, so that some of the charm of the original edition would be lost on the reader 
of the present day in publishing a reprint. Accordingly, in this new edition, it was arranged to leave the 
original text intact, to introduce such captions and rubrics as should assist the reader in separating the 
general topics, and to furnish a set of footnotes which should supply him with complete information. The 
publishers feel that this unique work will prove a source of delight to all who peruse its pages. 

THE EDITOR. David Eugene Smith, Ph.D., LL.D., has worked in de Morgan's library, is thor- 
oughly familiar with all of de Morgan's writings, and has a type of mind, tastes, experience and learning, 
which are sympathetic with those of the author of the Budget. 

VALUE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. This new edition may properly take its place among the valu- 
able works of reference in our public libraries. The circle-squarers and the angle-trisectors are present 
everywhere and always, and a popular work that will show them their folly is a thing that every library 
should welcome. The great care taken by Dr. Smith in his notes also renders the work invaluable on a 
shelf of general reference. Two Volumes, pp. 500 each. Cloth, $3.50 per Vol. 

Goethe: With Special Reference to His Philosophy 

By DR. PAUL CARUS 

A sympathetic study of one of the most notable men in the world's history. The author delineates to 
us Goethe, the man, the poet, the thinker, and Goethe the man is almost a more attractive figure than the 
poet or the thinker. He was sanely human; liberal, but not an infidel; religious, but not dogmatic or 
addicted to church partisanship; he worshipped God in Nature, so that we may call him either a pantheist 
or a monist. He was positive in his inmost nature and so opposed the destructiveness of all negativism. 

A positive attitude was so characteristic of Goethe that he denounced the methods of so-called higher 
criticism as applied to Homer, as well as to the New Testament. His satire on Barth, the New Testament 
higher critic of his day, and many of his philosophical poems are here translated for the first time. 

Goethe's relations with women have often been criticized and rarely understood. His friendship with 
Friederike is described in this book and judged with fairness. The facts are stated, not in a partisan spirit, 
but purely from the historical standpoint. 

Among the large number of books on the interpretation and appreciation of the ethics and philosophy

ESSAYS AND ESSAYISTS. 



We doubt whether any kind of reading 
yields more easy pleasure than the good 
essay. Of course it lacks the excitements of 
the higher forms of literature, the vivid 
lightning and appalling thunder of tragedy; 
the epic splendor, where verse marches on like 
captive kings and warriors in a Roman tri- 
umph ; the ordered disorder of the comic med- 
ley, which makes our sides ache and our tense 
minds relax; the interest of the novel, which 
seizes upon us with the first page and keeps us 
in pleasing torment until we turn the last; 
the keen, instantaneous joys and pains of the 
lyric. All these it lacks; or rather, it has 
them only by hints and recollected visions. 
The essay is something like an autumn stream 
which flows before us gleaming white or 
sombre through its matted debris of red and 
yellow and green and brown, a carpet which 
has been blossoms, which has been foliage 
waving in the wind and sun. Half our inter- 
est in the essay is in the current of mind and 
personality it reveals, and half in the rich 
burden which it bears. 

All other literary kinds are fenced about 
with restrictions : they have laws and methods 
which they cannot overstep ; a circle is drawn 
about them to keep out the evil influence 
which would tear them to pieces; they must 
retain their form, like a Prince Rupert drop, 
which if it be pinched in the tail shatters into 
fragments. But the only rule of the essay is 
to have no rule. It is most like a little piece 
of original chaos. Of course it generally has 
a subtle evolution; and like everything that 
tangibly exists, it must have a beginning, a 
middle, and an end. Subject, however, to the 
slightest restrictions it can be anything and 
do everything. It can jump from one business 
to another, some of De Quincey's essays are 
one monstrous digression. It can mingle 
heroic outlines with the homeliest details, as 
Cellini threw his household utensils into the 
molten bronze to eke out the cast of his 
Perseus. It can be a traveller's sketch or a 
Dutch painting of an interior. It can be gay 
and lively with adventure, or can rise to 
solemn fugues of thought as in Sir Thomas 



46 



THE DIAL 



[July 15 



Browne's "Urn Burial," Milton's "Areopa- 
gitica," Addison's "Vision of Mirzah," or 
De Quincey's " Our Ladies of Sorrow." It 
is the miscellaneous form of literature: an 
olla podrida; in its poorest manifestations a 
hash, what the Bowery waiter calls " a 
graveyard stew." 

Essays divide into two main species: those 
which deal with life, and those which voice 
opinions about books, pictures, art of all sorts. 
We hope we are not pushing analysis too far, 
but the first of these species again divides into 
two kinds : the essay where the personality of 
the author is dominant, and that in which, 
as in a Claude Lorraine glass, we get minia- 
ture glimpses of the outside world. In the 
first we are talking with the man himself, as 
with the most intimate acquaintance. "We are 
seated in Sieur de Montaigne's library, and he 
" rolls us out his mind." The flood of erudi- 
tion is much ; but more are his frank revela- 
tions about himself, his friends, his tastes, 
even about the gravel which afflicts him. Or 
we are in Charles Lamb's chambers, among 
that wonderful circle of wits and oddities 
whom he attracted as a loadstone does metallic 
dust, and we listen to his crackling fire of 
puns, his rhapsodies about old books and 
brawn and suckling pigs. Or we are with 
Hazlitt in the hut at Winterslow, watching 
the red sunset die upon the hills ; or we walk 
with him a summer's day while he discourses 
of the poets he has known or the lodging- 
house keeper's daughter whom he worshipped. 
Or we are with Stevenson in the wynds of 
Edinburgh, or on the neighboring hills, listen- 
ing through him to the mighty talkers of his 
acquaintance. All these men are nothing if 
not autobiographical. They are intensely in- 
terested in themselves and everything that 
happens to them. Why is it that such egotism 
does not revolt us? They fling themselves 
upon our interest with the most naive confi- 
dence, and we receive them with open arms. 
The more they tell us the more we want to 
know. Nay, if an essayist comes along who 
rather holds us at a distance, we get in a huff 
and want little to do with him. Bagehot is 
almost as clever as Hazlitt, and a good deal 
wittier than Stevenson ; but the world hardly 
knows that Bagehot lived. He has the reserve 
of the man of the world, an air of good 
society; and, to paraphrase one of his own 
sayings, it' is very much as if a steam engine 
was making phrases. 



To unbosom oneself seems to be a short cut 
to the affection of the world, which likes to 
play the part of a priest in the confessional 
and hearken to sins and peccadilloes, vaunt- 
ings and vaporings. That is the secret of the 
perennial charm of memoirs, whether Cel- 
lini's grim and boasting tale or Pepys's can- 
did one. It is what gave Marie Bashkirtseff's 
book its vogue not long ago ; the world recog- 
nized that she simply told what most young 
girls think, though no one before had had the 
courage to set it down. If Walt Whitman, 
instead of writing queer verse, had put into 
good prose all that laudation of himself, he 
would probably have ten readers where he now 
has one. But the great essayists, those we 
have named and others of the same blood, min- 
gle their egotism with modesty and geniality 
and humor. It is their enormous enjoyment 
of life which they communicate to us. 

The older English essays, those of Addison 
and Steele and Johnson and Goldsmith, were 
not nearly so individual, so pregnant with 
personality, as the later ones. These writers, 
hid themselves under an assumed character^ 
or created a club to carry on their miscella- 
nies. They were novelists in miniature, satir- 
ists and moralists at large. They set out to- 
picture the life about them, to scourge the 
follies and lighter vices of the world. They 
give vignettes of characters, kit-cat portraits^ 
thumb-nail sketches, Sir Roger de Coverley,. 
Will Honeywood, Beau Tibbs, the Man in 
Black, and many others. The short story 
exists in their works, in germ at least, East- 
ern apologues, fables, and the like. But in 
the main they were curiously journalistic. 
They gave the world about them a report of 
itself. And their world was the Town: a 
world of paint and powder and patches and 
pomatum. When this world was driven from 
the stage it found refuge in the miscellany 
prints. Bright and charming and various as 
this form of the essay is, it cannot compete 
with the novel, the comedy, the large satire. 
The essay proper still remains the essay of 
personality, the intimate talk, that is, of one 
who is revealing himself at every word. 

The critical essay, however, is perhaps more 
important, and is certainly the most widely 
cultivated. Authors, artists, creators of every 
kind,, have .always, been contemptuous of the 
critic. . But what, do they publish or show 
their works- for if they do not want people to 
have opinions about them 1 At its worst, a 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



47 



criticism is an advertisement. It is true that 
probably fifty per cent of contemporary criti- 
cism is always ludicrously wrong. But the 
other fifty per cent is penetrating, just, help- 
ful. After three hundred years of Shake- 
spearean laudation, there is nothing that sur- 
passes Ben Jonson's famous lines on the poet. 
Side by side with Dr. Johnson's sneering 
remarks about Gray, are his keen and true 
sentences about Collins. Side by side with 
" Blackwood's " denunciation of Keats is 
Hunt's enthusiastic appreciation of him. Side 
by side with Lady Eastlake's description of 
Charlotte Bronte as one who had forfeited the 
companionship of her own sex is Sydney 
Dobell's noble eulogium of Emily Bronte. 
The fact is that really great critics are rarer 
than great artists. In all English literature, 
there are only four of the former class 
Johnson, Coleridge, Hazlitt, and Matthew 
Arnold; while there are a good many more 
than forty great writers. Even about the 
accepted authors of the past the spirit of 
ignorance and envy is always surging up 
in revolt. We are always being told that 
Homer and Virgil, Shakespeare and Milton, 
are passe, and of small account besides some 
new luminary. 

The critical essay, also, is of two sorts : that 
which deals with the underlying principles of 
art, and that which is devoted to appreciations 
of single authors or works. In its greatest 
manifestations the former kind rises to the 
treatise; and a few of these, Aristotle's 
" Poetics," Longinus's " On the Sublime," and 
Lessing's "Laocob'n," are monuments of 
genius which dispute place with the great 
creative works of the world. But the brief, 
discursive, appreciative, critical essay is the 
more delightful. Like an actor's interpreta- 
tion of a part on the stage, it adds something 
to the original. It gives the work studied un- 
der new lights, helps it with caressing tones 
and endearments of admiration, brings it into 
focus with other pieces of the same kind. It 
is the critic's soul and mind thrown in as a 
makeweight to the author's. It is the greatest 
reward the artist can receive. And for the 
reader, as Sir Richard Steele said, there is no 
greater favor that one man can do another 
than to tell him the manner of his being 
pleased. 

The best criticisms are excursions and 
forays into the past. They are onsets to re- 
cover the body of Patroclus in order to bear 



him to his tent, cleanse his wounds, and give 
him splendid funeral. Or to change the figure, 
the undergrowth which is continually spring- 
ing up tends to choke and kill the giants of the 
forest; it is the main business of the critic to 
make these giants visible and accessible so that 
their shade and shelter may be of use ; to 
mankind. 

It is not worth while to exaggerate the im- 
portance of the essay, either the personal, the 
creative, or the critical kind. Its slippered ease 
and sauntering pedestrianism are not con- 
ducive to the great actions of art. When the 
artist is really inspired, soul fuses itself with 
body. Form is a necessity, and that form is 
succinct, supple, rapid in motion. Here and 
there, essays stand out which fulfil the condi- 
tions of creative art. The " Urn Burial," the 
" Reverie in Boar's Head Tavern, Eastcheap," 
the "Vision of Sudden Death," these are 
some of its triumphs. But if the essay is sel- 
dom great, it is often pleasurable and lovable 
in the extreme. It is literature in undress, 
the soul uttering itself in artless and unpre- 
tending ways. CHARLES LEONARP MoORE , 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



SUPERIMPOSED CULTURE is but a thin var- 
nish, at best. In fact, it is no culture at all, 
in the true sense of the word. Every person 
capable of culture claims the right to work out 
his own intellectual salvation from within, 
aided only by such hints and helps as shall 
not compromise his spiritual independence. 
In the current issue of " The Hibbert Jour- 
nal," a protest against "America's Bondage 
to the German Spirit " is made by Dr. Joseph 
H. Crooker, whose many years' observation of 
the workings of Teutonic academicism in our 
own colleges and universities has qualified 
him to speak on the subject with understand- 
ing and conviction. That such a protest 
should be called for in this one hundred and 
thirty-ninth year of our national existence is 
a rather surprising and still more humiliat- 
ing development, but it is useless to blink the 
facts as set forth by Dr. Crooker. Too long 
has it been true, with certain modifications 
and exceptions, that "the one thing that 
makes an impression in our university circles 
is the scholarship that is marked: Made in 
Germany! And just here lies some of the 
mischief . . 'made' in Germany. It has 
been, too often, a scholarship, not ripened in 
the warm, brooding atmosphere of a humane 
and humanising culture, but a standardised

erudition, intent on ' accumulation of mere 
facts, tested by cubic measure, sought for 
ends of efficiency, fitted to help man as a 
mechanism, and imbued with a vast conceit 
of knowledge." Due tribute is paid to all 
that is best in the spirit that America has 
breathed in from the Germany of the past; 
nevertheless the question for us to-day is 
this : " Is it wise and wholesome to have tens 
of thousands of our susceptible American 
youths, in our colleges and universities the 
intellectual aristocracy of the land, the future 
leaders of American opinion and action 
constantly under the training of men who 
have been thoroughly Germanised and to a 
decided degree de- Americanised ?" Of course 
such a question would be pertinent whether 
our educational ideals and methods were im- 
ported from Germany or China or Mozam- 
bique or the planet Mars; it is the fact of 
wholesale importation that, first and fore- 
most, is fraught with possibilities of evil. 
Hope of better things as soon as peace is re- 
stored brightens the close of Dr. Crocker's 
article, which, let it be added, covers a larger 
field, in its consideration of German influ- 
ence on America, than has been indicated in 

this brief notice. 



THE DEDICATION OF THE FINEST OF UNI- 
VERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS, the splendid 
Widener Memorial at Harvard, took place 
June 24, with Senator Lodge as the orator of 
the occasion. As he truthfully said, "no 
other university and scarcely any state or 
nation possesses a library building so elabo- 
rately arranged, so fitted with every device 
which science and ingenuity can invent for 
the use of books by scholars and students." 
The address was notable from beginning to 
end for its fine enthusiasm for all that is true 
and noble in literature and learning. It 
revealed, by quotation and allusion, the wide 
reading and sound scholarship of the speaker, 
and showed also his sympathies with all who 
love good books and find their solace and sus- 
tenance in the masterpieces of literature. 
Excellent was this passage, toward the end of 
the speech : " Here, as to all great collections 
of books, as to all books anywhere which have 
meaning and quality, come those who never 
write, who have no songs to sing, no theories 
with which they hope to move or enlighten 
the world, men and women who love knowl- 
edge and literature for their own sakes and 
are content. Here those who toil, those who 
are weary and heavy-laden, come for rest. 
Here among the books we can pass out of this 
workaday world, never more tormented, more 
in anguish, than now, and find, for a brief 



hour at least, happiness, perchance consola- 
tion, certainly another world and a blessed 
forgetfulness of the din and the sorrows 
which surround us." Finely fitting, too, were 
the lines quoted from a living English poet 
who writes thus of Shakespeare in these trou- 
bled times: 

" 0, let me leave the plains behind, 

And let me leave the vales below; 
Into the highlands of the mind, 
Into the mountains let me go. 

" Here are the heights, crest beyond crest, 

With Himalayan dews impearled; 
And I will watch from Everest 

The long heave of the surging world." 



A NATION'S UNFAITH IN ITS OWN LITERATURE 
is not an inspiring spectacle, any more than is 
a nation's excessive pride in its own literature. 
Something of that timid questioning of its 
right to hold up its head in the literary world 
which this country is thought even yet not to 
have wholly outgrown is noticeable in modern 
Japan's attitude toward foreign authors. 
Translations and importations hold a noto- 
riously prominent place in the Japanese book- 
trade; and more than one native writer is 
commenting regretfully on this fact. A late 
issue of " The Japan Advertiser " cites an in- 
stance of this disapproval. "Nation's ambi- 
tions,'' it quotes from an unnamed author, 
"spring from firm convictions. Without the 
latter there can be no former. When we look 
at the conditions of our world of thoughts, 
which is easily conquered by foreign ideas and 
litterateurs, we cannot but question the self- 
confidence of our nation." The writer then 
notes the influx of Russian literature that fol- 
lowed the Russo-Japanese war, and names 
other European authors that are eagerly read 
in Japan. A leading article in " The Japan 
Times " makes similar reference to the native 
fondness for occidental literature of all kinds, 
and adds : " The comparative scarcity of new 
original works undoubtedly promises badly 
for the intellectual independence of the coun- 
try. The truth is, we have been accustomed to 
importing ready-made thought and have felt 
no inconvenience as long as this facility has 
remained open. The present closing up of the 
intellectual centre of Europe by war has, how- 
ever, awakened us keenly to the disadvantage 
we are under, and we feel confident that the 
genius of the race will meet the deficiency, 
even as necessity will father more original 
thinking." A recent remarkable increase in 
the reading habit is among the best of signs for 
Japan's future, but her considerable literary 
use of a language not her own, with the occa-

sional inevitable departures from that lan- 
guage's proper idiom, is not wholly to be 
approved, however much the western world is 
indebted thereto for its knowledge of things 
Japanese. By all means let Japan adopt a 
manageable alphabet in which to write her 
beautifully expressive tongue, and then let her 
develop her literature according to her native 
bent. . . . 

OUR ANCESTORS' RESPECT FOR BOOKS was 
greater than ours of the present time, partly, 
of course, because books were far less plenti- 
ful in the early days than now, and most of 
them came from the other side of the broad 
Atlantic an ocean much wider then than in 
this age of steam and electricity. At Wil- 
mington, Vermont, there has been found an 
old book of records revealing the interesting 
fact that there existed a "social library" in 
that town as early as 1795. On the last day 
of that year the Wilmington Social Library 
was organized, and the record book gives its 
constitution and by-laws, with a list of sub- 
scribers. Among the miscellaneous entries in 
the book is one to the effect that Israel Law- 
ton was fined seventeen cents for dropping 
tallow on book No. 93 a sufficiently heavy 
fine, one would think, considering the relative 
value of money then and now, and the re- 
movability of grease spots from paper by 
expert methods (which, however, may not 
have been known in the Wilmington of 1795). 
Timothy Castle was fined six cents for spill- 
ing one drop of tallow on book No. 16. (Poor 
fellow! He was doubtless so absorbed in his 
reading and so eager to make the most of the 
scant hour or so before bedtime that he did 
not notice how he was tilting the candle.) 
Levi Packard was mulcted in sixty cents for 
tearing the binding of book No. 106 a griev- 
ous offense, surely. Other fines were imposed 
for dogs'-ears and finger-marks. And to 
think that to-day one can go to the public 
library, especially in the rush hours, and 
hand in without fear or trembling a book 
pretty well stuck up with chewing gum and 
candy, and quite freely annotated and under- 
lined in 'pencil if not in ink! though of 
course the library of any librarian reading 
this is too carefully conducted to admit of 
any such outrage. 



THE RUSSIAN PEASANT'S APPRECIATION OP 
SHAKESPEARE is strikingly illustrated by an 
incident recorded in Professor Leo Wiener's 
recent book, "An Interpretation of the Rus- 
sian People." In a chapter devoted to " The 
Peasant" and containing other instances of 
unexpected good literary taste among the 



lowly, the author tells of certain readings be- 
fore a peasant Sunday school where the hear- 
ers ranged in age from early youth to forty 
years or more, and where " Oliver Twist" and 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" met with high favor, 
especially when offered in unabridged form; 
but still more marked appears to have been 
the preference for Shakespeare, uncut and 
unadapted, to Shakespeare in short narra- 
tive prose (like the Lamb "Tales") or other- 
wise shorn of his full glory. "King Lear" 
was read to these unsophisticated hearers in. 
three forms, the short tale by Lamb, a native 
adaptation with happy ending, and the com- 
plete tragedy in literal translation. The listen- 
ers' quick appreciation of the latter, despite 
its confusing foreign names and unfamiliar 
setting, was astonishing. The success of the 
reading was complete. When one of the 
younger girls referred to the general simi- 
larity between " King Lear " and the Russian 
adaptation, " Old Man Nikita and his Three 
Daughters," she was met with the contemptu- 
ous retort: " What a comparison ! That was 
written for peasants, while this is for gentle- 
folk." " This is much better," she was prompt 
to admit, adding that whereas the peasant 
version had a happy ending, "such a story 
never could end well." Significant was the 
refusal of this company of working people to 
be moved to mirth by Dickens's humor; it 
left them blank, it touched no responsive 
chord, though in other respects Dickens's 
genius met with gratifying appreciation. It 
would be interesting to learn whether the 
same hearers showed themselves at all appre- 
ciative of Shakespeare's humor as displayed 
in his comedies; they were quick to indicate 
their enjoyment of the fool in " Lear." But 
probably life is too serious and even tragic a 
thing to the mujik to admit of much place 
for careless merriment. 



MISPLACED BOOKS are for the time being as 
good as lost, or as bad as lost. This is notably 
true in the case of library books carelessly 
returned to the open shelves by readers whose 
regard for order and system is so slight as to 
render them indifferent to the consequences 
of carelessly tossing Miss Alcott's "Little 
Women " on to the shelf containing Zola's 
novels, or of tucking away " The Light of 
Asia " by the side of " Vestiges of Creation." 
No little act more clearly betrays a person's 
lack of that courtesy which consists in a 
scrupulous regard for the rights and the 
convenience of others than this thoughtless 
misplacing of books on the public library 
shelves. At the Minneapolis Public Library,

A MONUMENT OF ENCYCLOPAEDIC RESEARCH, 

bearing witness to the rare devotion, the en- 
lightened public spirit, the untiring energy, 
and the comprehensive scholarship of Dr. 
Takami Modzume, of Tokyo, is now awaiting 
publication. Whether it will be published, 
or left in manuscript (of two thousand two 
hundred volumes) to the Imperial Household 
Department, depends on the author's success 
in obtaining three thousand subscribers of 
one hundred and thirty yen each to defray 
the cost of printing. He has spent the best 
part of his sixtV-eight years, and 140,000 yen 
of his money, besides incurring a debt of half 
that amount, in preparing this work for the 
instruction of his own people in what they 
ought to know about themselves and their 
country. For thirty years he has been delv- 
ing in the lore of Japan, China, and India, 
going through more than one hundred thou- 
sand volumes, in the compilation of a refer- 
ence work having sixty thousand entries, 
alphabetically arranged, relating to Japanese 
life and usages, and also in making a vo- 
luminous compendium (if that be not a con- 
tradiction in terms) of extracts from the 
hundred thousand volumes examined, these 
extracts treating of the topics enumerated in 
his reference work. In a country where dis- 
astrous fires are as frequent as they re in 
Japan, books of the sort required by Dr. 
Modzume in prosecuting his self-imposed task 
.are often extremely rare and difficult of 
access. Hence the time and labor and expense 
involved in his undertaking, which will have a 
corresponding value when completed. " The 



Japan Times," in an appreciative editorial 
containing the foregoing facts, recalls the ex- 
ample of another and much earlier Japanese 
scholar and public benefactor, the Buddhist 
priest Ankaku, who in the infancy of Bud- 
dhism in Japan visited China and committed 
to memory all the scriptures of India that had 
been translated into Chinese; then he re- 
turned home, hung a small desk to his neck, 
went from house to house begging a sheet of 
paper at each, and so in twenty-five years of 
pilgrimage succeeded in putting into writing 
the precious results of his arduous studies. 



HOW TO BECOME AN EXPERT BOOK -COLLECTOR 

is not to be explained in three words, or even 
in a whole lecture; but a course of lectures, 
supplemented by the inspection and handling 
of some examples of fine book-making, some 
products of the famous presses of early and 
later times, will accomplish something toward 
opening the eyes to what is genuine and what 
is shoddy in book-manufacture. Announce- 
ment is made of such a course of lectures at 
Harvard, Division of the Fine Arts, for the 
coming academic year. Mr. George Parker 
Winship, Lecturer on the History of Printing, 
will give this course, which "is intended for 
men who are interested in books as objects of 
art, and who desire to possess or to produce 
beautiful books." From the period of the 
illuminated manuscript to the present time the 
history of book-production will be traced, with 
such attention to mechanical details as ;to 
enable the pupil to distinguish honest merit 
from pretentious sham. The "Widener Memo- 
rial room in the new library building will be 
the appropriate meeting-place of the class, 
and not only the Widener collection, but also 
other special collections from the Treasure 
Room of the Harvard Library will be avail- 
able as object lessons. The Boston Public 
Library and other libraries in the vicinity, 
private as well as public, will be visited for 
the purposes of demonstration and instruc- 
tion ; and in addition to the required reading 
a written report will be expected from each 
student on some bibliographical topic of 
especial interest to him. 


PLUMED KNIGHTS, as we meet them in the 
pages of romance, are a picturesque and

the spectacle seems somehow to lose a great

Sir Walter ? Already there was one Sir Wal- 
ter enshrined in our hearts, and this other, 
despite his acknowledged modesty and worth, 
almost seemed like an interloper. " Sir 
Leslie Stephen" also came with some diffi- 
culty from the tongue long accustomed to the 
more democratic title; and, considerably 
later, " Sir James M. Barrie " caused a little 
vocal fumbling. Harder still would it be to 
shape our mouths to " Sir Rudyard Kipling " 
or "Sir Herbert G. Wells" or "Sir Arnold 
Bennett." But who would dare predict, in 
this be-knighted age, that some such demand 
may not be made upon us before long? Only 
the other day that admired Bengalese poet 
and sage, the author of " Gitanjali," became 
transmogrified from what his honorable East- 
Indian ancestry and traditions and his own 
achievements had caused him to be in our 
minds and imaginations, and appeared before 
us in tasteless hybrid form as Sir Rabin- 
dranath Tagore. It is almost as if , for example, 
one so distinctive and inimitable as our own 
Mark Twain had suddenly been metamor- 
phosed into " Sir Samuel Clemens," or " Lord 
Stormfield," or some similar inconceivable 
absurdity. In the republic of letters what 
place or need is there for titles and orders 
and other bedizenments bestowed by royalty 1 ? 
And yet, after all, this is very much a ques- 
tion of taste and personal point of view ; and 
therefore the old adage, de gustibus, will be 
the short and sufficient rejoinder of anyone 
not like-minded. ... 

THE LIBRARY AS AN AID TO EFFICIENCY is not 

exactly the kind of library some of us delight 
in. The library of our dreams is likely to 
resemble, in one respect at least, the ideal 
university as defined by Lowell. He used to 
say a true university is a place where nothing 
useful is taught ; and it is pleasant to imagine 
a library as a collection of books containing 
nothing useful. Nevertheless, if books must 
be turned to other purposes than those of 
pure delight, one can bear the thought of 
their promoting the prosperity and happi- 
ness of some of the hundreds of thousands 
who daily have access to the thickly sprinkled 
public libraries of our broad land. And there 
are now many other collections of books, not 
quite so public, maintained by the great 
business houses of our large cities as instru- 
ments for the perfecting of the efficiency of 
those whom they employ. The growing im- 
portance of these collections has only recently 
been revealed by the new and enterprising- 
periodical, "Special Libraries," and there are 
other kindred publications that call occa- 
sional attention to the utilitarian aspect of 



the library. For instance, the June issue of 
the "Wisconsin Library Bulletin" has an 
" eye-opener " in the shape of a sketch of 
"Libraries in Business," by Miss Pearl I. 
Field, of the Chicago Public Library, who is 
officially connected with the business libraries 
of the city, so far as they maintain relations 
with the public library, whose head, be it 
added, has shown himself energetic in the 
establishment of such special book-collections 
in commercial houses. 



THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN READING AND 

STUDYING is not clearly marked. In England 
the university man " reads " for honors, or for 
a coming examination, or to fit himself for a 
chosen profession. He "reads," even though 
it be algebra or geometry or trigonometry that 
claims his attention, whereas in America these 
and far more literary subjects would be made 
the object of " study." But it certainly sounds 
pleasanter and easier and perhaps more dig- 
nified and gentleman-like to "read" for a 
double-first than to "study" for the same 
prize. Therefore it may be well that the Yale 
authorities, in adopting a well-established 
custom of Cambridge University, have an- 
nounced that a " reading term " rather than a 
"studying term" is to be introduced at New 
Haven in September. Thus, it is explained, 
the students will have " an opportunity to do 
special reading a few weeks before the regular 
opening of the university." They will be free 
from the ordinary college routine, and no ex- 
tra tuition fee will be demanded. Shall we, 
in course of time, have the vacation " reading 
parties," in rural retreats, so agreeably de- 
picted in English fiction and elsewhere as a 
pleasant and profitable part of the English 
university system ? 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

THE WISCONSIN SURVEY ONCE MORE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
It is the recognized privilege of a defeated 
attorney to appeal his case from the trial court to 
the press, and there to urge, ex parte, evidence 
that has not found credence and views that have 
not prevailed in the original tribunal. This privi- 
lege is exercised in THE DIAL of June 24, 1915, by 
Mr. William H. Allen, who there sets forth, at 
some length, matter submitted by him as " Joint 
Director" of the University of Wiscqnsin Survey 
to his employers, the State Board of Public 
Affairs, and not adopted by that body. With its 
eyes open to all the evidence, that Board has 
chosen to write its own report, which is wholly 
different in tenor from the findings of its agent 
and which constitutes a substantial repudiation of 
those findings. The interested reader will do well 



52 



THE DIAL 



[ July 15 



to compare the report of the Board with the 
report of its employe, and with University com- 
ment thereon, all officially published by the State 
of Wisconsin.* 

It is not the purpose of this communication to 
object in any way to Mr. Allen's right of appeal 
to the public, but it seems necessary to warn the 
public in considering that appeal not to give 
credence to alleged facts or conclusions without 
specific verification from original sources or com- 
parison with University comment. Mr. Allen's 
letter teems with misstatements which have been 
publicly challenged and refuted by the University. 
This refutation need not be here repeated, since it 
is readily accessible in the official report; but one 
case of gross misrepresentation seems to call for 
some comment, viz., the eight doctors' theses dis- 
cussed by Mr. Allen with much condemnation of 
their alleged slovenly, unscholarly, and dishonest 
character. The facts are as follows: 

Eight doctors' theses were read, under Mr. 
Allen's direction, by persons professing no compe- 
tence in the subject matter of the theses, but under 
instructions to look for misspelled words, errors of 
punctuation, citation, and other mechanical de- 
fects. Some of these theses, although accepted by 
the University for substantial merit, were, at the 
time chosen for their inspection, incomplete work 
in that they were fresh from the hands of the 
amanuensis and had not been revised for the 
printer. Numerous errors of the kind sought were 
here available, as is common in such unrevised 
" copy " ; and the following specimens, incor- 
porated in the printed Allen report, illustrate his 
standards for measuring the value of research 
work. He found " coust " for "coast," "ofra" 
for "of a," "chashed" for "clashed," " cof rec- 
tion " for " correction," etc. They are all pre- 
served for posterity, as the transient ripple on 
some beach of past ages is preserved in fossilized 
mud. Some of the theses read were in their defini- 
tive, published, form, and the critic graciously 
acknowledged that here " there were relatively few 
errors in spelling," " relatively few typographical 
mistakes." The University protested and protests 
this whole procedure as directed only to " its 
clothes," and in no way furnishing a criterion of 
substantial merit in its work. 

Criticism directed toward such merit, made by 
Mr. Allen, in the revision of his report for the 
printer, apparently under the stimulus of the 
phrase last quoted, the University regards as a 
wholly different matter, directed in fact " to the 
living body," and legitimate in aim if not in 
execution. Although often flippant in tone and 
showing little competence in respect of the matter 
criticized, these Survey queries and innuendoes 
(positive statements are conspicuously lacking) 
have received detailed reply that is published in 
the official volume. The University justifies its 
acceptance and approval of the theses in question", 
with one exception, and defends their substantial

worth. One thesis contains many quotations from 
a book often cited. In three cases the quoted mat- 
ter, of considerable extent, is not accompanied by 
the proper marks and references, and the Uni- 
versity here concedes a technical plagiarism (pos- 
sibly flagrant) that should not have escaped 
detection. 

Among the other seven theses there is doubtless 
a considerable range of excellence, although in 
Mr. Allen's hands they fall under a common con- 
demnation having little relation to differences in 
their real merit. An accurate estimate of such 
merit is indeed difficult, since different critics of 
like competence may, and do, differ considerably 
in their judgment of the same thesis. With respect 
to these differences, always unavoidably present, 
the University conceives its duty to be : To main- 
tain a standard of excellence below which no 
thesis shall be accepted, and to secure in the 
average thesis a degree of merit considerably 
exceeding this minimum standard. 

In University opinion the theses in question 
satisfy the requirement thus formulated, but 
recognizing that neither its own officers nor Mr. 
Allen's agents can pass definitive and final judg- 
ment in this respect, the University, conforming 
to a recognized practice, seeks through publication 
to submit every doctor's thesis to the judgment of 
all scholars interested in its field. For each thesis 
here criticized by Mr. Allen, where such publica- 
tion has not yet been made, the University has 
submitted the work to the judgment of two or 
more scholars of recognized eminence in its field, 
and with their approval has published over their 
names their judgments concerning it. None of 
these scholars was in any way connected with the 
preparation of the theses or with the University 
of Wisconsin. A few of the less favorable of 
these judgments are reproduced by Mr. Allen, 
who neglects, however, to point out that in every 
case the weight of opinion is that the University 
would have erred in refusing approval to the 
thesis. He ignores hearty commendation of theses 
scorned by himself, and is quite oblivious to com- 
ment by two eminent scholars upon the thesis most 
sharply (but wrongly) condemned by himself as 
plagiarized. In their phrase, " it is a good 
thesis," " good enough to print with credit to the 
University," " I have been unable to find any 
errors " ; and there follows sharp comment by 
one of these scholars upon the presumption dis- 
played by the Survey critic in dealing with a 
thesis outside the range of his competence. 

It is not here purposed to inflict upon the 
reader a review of Mr. Allen's aberrations. They 
and the commentary upon them must be sought in 
the official printed record; but the foregoing ex- 
hibit is fairly typical of the points at issue. To 
the reader having some familiarity with University 
life and work, the fatuous character of much of 
the material furnished by Mr. Allen to THE DIAL 
will appear sufficiently evident without comment, 
e. g., that any one person should " supervise 
research " and " read theses offered toward ad- 
vanced degrees by graduate students " working in 
the most diverse fields of knowledge, astronomy,

bacteriology, chemistry, dairying, electrical engi- 
neering, forestry, geology, history, language, 
mathematics, etc. The day of the Admirable 
Crichton is past, at least in university circles; 
and such universal genius as would be here re- 
quired seems reserved for non-academic folk. 

Possibly a revelation of such abnormal genius 
should be recognized in Mr. Allen's assurance to 
the reader that " the Survey set out to be coopera- 
tive " and agreement as to fact " was easily 
reached with regard to early sections." The 
writer of these lines recalls with mixed feelings 
the long list of corrections to such early sections, 
furnished by himself, in writing, formally ad- 
dressed by name to the " Joint Director," but 
never acknowledged, never discussed, and appar- 
ently without effect upon his published report. 
If an " agreement " may be thus reached " with- 
out difficulty," whose are the minds that meet 
in it? 

We deeply regret that an opportunity to render 
large service to academic interests through a com- 
petent and judicial survey of the University of 
Wisconsin has been worse than wasted by em- 
ployes of the State Board. Nevertheless, the 
University will consider in detail the study made 
by them, and will doubtless find among much chaff 
some good grain for which it will be pleased to 
make due acknowledgment. In the meantime, it 
asks the public to maintain an attitude of at least 
reserve toward alleged facts and proffered conclu- 
sions that have not been found able to bear exam- 
ination, and that have not found credence with the 
Board charged with ultimate responsibility in the 
matter. GEORGE C. COMSTOCK,

A WORD FOE DR. ALLEN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

If THE DIAL was mistaken in its editorial enti- 
tled "A Bull in the Educational China Shop," 
it was gratifying to see that it had the fair- 
ness to acknowledge its fallibility by allowing 
Dr. Allen to present his version of the story to 
your readers. 

It is true that " no one expected this- kind of 
a survey." Not even the University of Wiscon- 
sin, though it was opposed to the idea of a 
survey from its inception, expected that the 
truth, so carefully hidden through its bureau- 
cratic organization, its clever advertising, and its 
ingenious appeal to the people of the state 
through its agricultural and extension work, would 
be so frankly and completely laid before the pub- 
lic. The University wanted generalities. It got 
detailed facts. It wanted a report picturing the 
University as a few in authority wished it to be 
seen. It got a report as the six hundred faculty 
members saw it. Had Dr. Allen submitted to the 
intimidation brought to bear upon him in an 
effort to suppress certain findings, had he been 
willing to overlook the faults of those high up in 
educational circles, his report would have been 
lauded and extolled, and he himself doubtless 
taken into the inner circle of the elect. 



Surely it is time that we have found some one 
who is not afraid to tell the truth as he sees it, 
who will not be bound by the educational autocrats 
of the country, but who will come forth as a leader 
of the many who know, as he knows, that freedom 
of speech and freedom of action in the field of 
higher education are but rights in name alone.

KUNO MEYER AND THE HARVARD 

PRIZE -POEM. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
While agreeing fully with the general tenor and 
point of view of the excellent leading article, 
" The Pity of It ! " in your issue of June 24, I 
should like to point out that your statement of 
fact regarding the recent Kuno Meyer incident at 
Harvard is not accurate. After quoting from 
Professor Meyer's denunciation of the university, 
you say : " The occasion for this outpouring of emo- 
tion is nothing more than the fact that an irrespon- 
sible student, in a publication entirely controlled 
by students, has written in a sense antagonis- 
tic to the German cause ! " But in reality Pro- 
fessor Meyer's resentment, however immoderate, 
rested on sounder grounds. The offending poem, 
though written by an undergraduate, and pub- 
lished in " The Harvard Advocate," an under- 
graduate magazine, had been awarded the prize 
in a competition for poems about the war con- 
ducted by the "Advocate," and the two judges who 
made this award were Dean Briggs and Professor 
Bliss Perry. Was it wholly unnatural that Pro- 
fessor Meyer should interpret this action of two 
such prominent representatives of Harvard as 
indicative of the university's attitude toward his 
country? At any rate, it seems to me that your 
writer's statement of the circumstances connected 
with the incident, as quoted above, is quite unfair 
in view of the facts which I have cited.

A TRANSLATOR'S ERROR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In one of your recent issues a contributor cites 
some amusing mistakes of authors, and among 
these instances one from Henry Bordeaux. A 
passage from that writer's novel " Les Yeux qui 
S'ouvrent," issued in English as " The Awaken- 
ing," is quoted, in which the heroine speaks of a 
" telegraphed letter," and a few pages further 
on, a reader of this " telegraphed letter " is made 
to recognize the handwriting. The mistake is not 
Bordeaux's, but the translator's. The original 
French reads : " C'est une lettre sous enveloppe 
pneumatique." In other words, it was a letter 
sent by special pneumatic tubes or cjiutes, one 
of the " petits bleus," with which dwellers in 
Paris are familiar as being the French equivalent 
of our " special delivery." In a letter so sent 
there would of course be nothing absurd about 
one's recognizing the handwriting.

THE MODERN THOREATI.* 

Longfellow, so it is reported, is being less 
and less read in America. What the statistics 
may indicate as to Thoreau, I have no means 
of ascertaining; but I am confident that in 
the future he will be read more and more. 
His publishers are evidently of the same 
faith, for they have just issued a new and 
most convenient pocket edition of his com- 
plete works, in eleven volumes, bound in 
attractive leather covers, with good illus- 
trations (many of them new), and other 
embellishments suggesting an author whose 
circulation is to be wide and permanent. But 
I do not base my thesis as to Thoreau's 
increasing popularity on the appearance of 
this fine new edition, although that is a good 
commercial argument. I believe in his widen- 
ing audience because I believe in his increas- 
ing value for American life and American 
thinking. 

This is not merely because Thoreau is the 
most satisfying student of nature, certainly 
since Gilbert White, perhaps in English lit- 
erature. Nor is it solely because of his vigor- 
ous philosophy. You cannot separate his 
natural science from his speculation without 
injustice. You can as little appreciate Tho- 
reau's philosophy without his science, or his 
nature without his thought, as the song of a 
woodthrush away from the cool darkness of 
the June woods. It is the combination that 
makes this shy and courageous New En- 
glander an enduring figure. 

Thoreau entered upon his research into the 
secrets of nature in the spirit of wonder, not 
romance, or sentiment, but intelligent and 
stimulating wonder. And he came back from 
wondering with his mouth full of shrewd say- 
ings and intensely practical thought. No one 
can read "Walden" or "Spring" without 
feeling that this man stood with his feet firmly 
on the ground of fact ; no one can read them 
without realizing that here is one American at 
least who has made a permanent contribution 
to the theory of what is worth while in living. 

The modern schools of "nature students" 
have diverged widely from the path which 
Thoreau followed. The scientists have 
eschewed philosophy, and confined themselves 
to ascertainable fact. Well enough for them ; 
but unfortunate, perhaps, for us, who wish 
some profit from nature in our time, and may

distrust the leadership of men who criticize 
the ancients because they speculated upon 
truth, honor, happiness, instead of discover- 
ing what causes rain. Would Plato have been 
a specialist in egg-fertilization in 1915? one 
wonders. If so, the worse for the world and 
for Plato ! As for the mere " nature lovers," 
they have gone to the other extreme; they 
have foregone the ideals of science completely, 
and lapsed into sentimentality. Thoreau was 
thrilled by a wild duck, a rhodora, even a 
muskrat. For the romantic nature lover, 
beast, bird, and flower must be given false per- 
sonality and all the attributes of man before 
his imagination kindles. This is the decadence 
of nature study, as the ultra-scientific atti- 
tude threatens to become its Alexandrianism. 

Thoreau's practice was first to study nature 
honestly, and then to think from it into terms 
of human life. His observations are pain- 
fully exact, without perhaps always being 
accurate. See how he measures his dead moose, 
makes notes upon the webs of his flying squir- 
rel, records the flowers of each Maine back- 
. water, and studies the habits of the musquash 
whenever and wherever he finds him. But his 
notes are seldom complete. They are not, 
indeed, an end in themselves. Many of his 
records would be scorned by a professional 
classifier. But for their own purposes they 
are complete enough. Thoreau studies the 
Maine forests that he may think out the value 
of the pine tree for man. He tramps the 
frozen marshes of Massachusetts that he may 
speak honestly of what thrills him in wild 
nature after knowing it as one knows a friend. 
Always he is pushing down to fact, always 
rising again to correct and renew his specula- 
tions. He did not live to classify, he classi- 
fied to live. 

A casual reader might well suppose that 
Thoreau's passionate attempt to know his 
environment was merely a phase of self- 
development. He is constantly speaking of 
the " flow " of his life, always moving toward 
some unattained goal. He is ever allowing 
the personal joy which observation gave him 
to escape into his pages. But Thoreau's 
ardent independence is deceptive. Walden 
was a social, not an individual, experiment, 
paradoxical as it may seem. It was an at- 
tempt to discover how man will live when 
self-dependent and free of the conventions, 
rather than a call to the hermit's life. And 
this is true of all Thoreau's works. They are 
social, in a very excellent sense. They consti- 
tute, one and all, an attempt to link the 
American to his environment, to his soil. See 
with what intense curiosity he studies the 
Indian. See with what entire absence of illu-

sion or sentimental romance he delights in his 
instinctive responses to natural phenomena. 
How he rejoices when Polis finds a hidden 
trail, or hears the moose across miles of water. 
The Indian is in accord with his background 
he has sunk roots in his soil. 

Compare Thoreau's Maine studies with his 
ramblings in Massachusetts, and you will find 
that he does his Massachusetts better. He 
finds more soil for the white man there. 
Maine, for Thoreau, is impressive ; but a little 
alien, a little monotonous. It fits the Indian ; 
it does not fit him. He prefers it to Boston ; 
but not to the country that lies about Con- 
cord. The rapprochement with nature that 
he seeks is more difficult in the endless for- 
ests of spruce and fir, than upon Lee's cliff, 
and round Walden pond. 

If I am right in my speculation, Thoreau 
is best understood in the simile of civilized 
man in a new country, trying to strike spir- 
itual roots into the environment it offers, as. 
his pioneer ancestors had in a very real sense 
made physical roots to grow there. This ex- 
plains the alternation of fact and 'philosophy 
that characterizes every one of his books, and 
most of all his best. " It is not important that 
the poet should say some particular thing, but 
that he should speak in harmony with nature," 
he says; meaning, I think, that the creative 
artist's first duty is to know his environment. 
And for Thoreau, environment was primarily 
nature. " Properly speaking there can be no 
history but natural history, for there is no 
past in the soul, but in nature." This may 
not be absolutely true; but it is true enough 
for the white man in America. 

One fault, at least, in Thoreau's work may 
be assignable to this pioneer quality. His 
writing often lacks form. It is best when it 
is closest to the diary, the most formless of 
literary modes. This has hurt his reputation 
with contemporary readers. The present is 
an age of form at least in America. We 
have achieved technique. Our short stories, 
our novels, our plays, and our photo-plays, 
are well built, even when there has been little 
with which to build them. A child recognizes 
form in a short story, and is troubled by its 
absence. A grown man often cannot tell good 
substance from bad. We read our Thoreau 
by excerpt selected where form has been at- 
tained, the wrong way to read him. 

The fault in part is Thoreau's. His life, as 
he says himself again and again, was always 
flowing. Like all faithful students, he never 
reached his goal. Unlike many philosophers, 
he was ever willing to test his creed. Hence 
his books are all experimental, all, even 
"Walden," mere notes upon life. He did not 



live long enough to find the ultimate form his 
imagination required. A deficiency this, if 
we are to judge him as an artist, although the 
age was quite as responsible as his genius. 
But even in this artistic incompleteness one 
finds a tonic. He is good medicine for the 
careless modern reader, who has come to 
believe that a well-worded description, a well- 
balanced narrative, an essay properly con- 
ducted to its final "punch." is, by reason of 
its successful form, necessarily true and good. 
" Nothing can be more useful to a man than a 
determination not to be hurried." Thoreau 
was not hurried into a deceptive, a prema- 
ture, a hollow perfection. His notes on life 
are unfinished, but they are true. 

And yet, though every one of his books, in 
a sense, is unfinished, I believe, as I have 
already said, that Thoreau will remain the 
most appreciated of all our earlier writers. 
His attitude toward the American background 
is more familiar now that most of us " take to 
the woods " at least once a year, than before 
the Civil War. His value becomes greater in 
measure as it becomes more difficult to breed 
such independent livers and thinkers. Civili- 
zation weighs upon us with a greater weight of 
complexity. The luxuries he despised are not 
only more abundant, they are more desirable 
than in his sparse New England.- Convention 
is more difficult to escape, because it has crys-^ 
tallized in a vast and bourgeois society. Fur- 
thermore, even when we produce Thoreaus, 
they do not speak out. They are self -regard- 
ing, not social. The mass of mediocre Amer- 
icans for whom our magazines are edited "and 
our books written daunts them. They may 
follow his advice of not hurrying. They may 
keep themselves free from the incumbrance 
of convention, as Thoreau kept his freedom by 
distrusting the ownership of land. But the 
weight of the vast majority keeps them silent. 
In idiosyncratic, free-thinking New England 
of the 'forties a "crank" like Thoreau could 
be sure of a hearing. He felt as writers 
must feel an audience waiting. But to-day 
one must be really a " crank " absurd, over- 
emphatic, unbalanced if one is to depart 
from what the bourgeois expect, and succeed. 
Let us value, then, Thoreau.

SOCIALISM AND THE GREAT WAR.* 

Almost as soon as German feet touched 
Belgian soil, books of crimination and re- 
crimination, of explanation, history, poetry, 
and prophecy, began to pour from the press. 
The first nine months of the war have given 
birth in America alone to two hundred and 
thirty-eight independent publications, as 
listed in the " Cumulative Book Index " under 
the title, " the European war." What the 
European presses have added to this number 
is only a matter of conjecture. Needless to 
say, much of this current history, born of the 
moment, dies in the next moment. Some of it 
will furnish valuable grist for future histo- 
rians, however, especially those works which 
aim at compilation of documentary evidence. 
Of such books, Mr. William English Waiting's 
" Socialists and the War " deserves and no 
doubt will receive high place. 

Whatever one may think of Socialism, the 
student of the times finds it of growing inter- 
est and importance to know what the socialists 
think. What they think of war and of the 
war is just now supreme. Mr. Walling, a 
trained student of politics and economics, a 
socialist himself of robust, independent, and 
non-sectarian opinions, undertakes to satisfy 
this interest in a volume containing the con- 
centrated essence of socialist pronouncements. 
He conceives his task as purely editorial ; and 
with remarkable judgment he sifts and culls, 
and with remarkable restraint he limits him- 
self to a minimum of comment. To present 
a brief adequate review of a book already so 
condensed and digested is of course an impos- 
sible task; yet one may hope to give some 
general topographical features. 

The book is planned in five parts. Part I. 
gives the general position of the socialists on 
war, including their attitude toward nation- 
alism, militarism, and imperialism. Impor- 
tant chapters are devoted to the General 
Strike as a remedy against war, and to the 
refusal of money aids for military purposes. 
Part II. deals with the period immediately 
before the war, the Balkan affairs with their 
sequels, and the revolutionary general strikes 
in Russia and Italy. Part III., "The Out- 
break of the War," is a splendid digest of the 
statements of official bodies and prominent 
socialists of the world, defining their attitude 
toward the inpending conflict. Part IV., the 
largest and by far the most important section, 
gives an account of socialist action and opin- 
ion during the war. Germany naturally is con- 
sidered with greatest particularity. Part V. 

* THE SOCIALISTS AND THE WAR. By William English Wall- 
ing. New York: Henry Holt & Co. 



takes up the socialist peace policy, and the 
consideration of various alleged socialist 
measures to which the belligerent governments 
have been driven. 

From these five hundred pages bristling 
with fact, opinion, and argument, certain 
salient observations are to be made. 

First, it is plain that Marxism is not synon- 
ymous with Socialism. A group of Marxian 
or " classical " socialists is everywhere con- 
fronted by a group of "revisionists," social- 
ists who believe in a progressive revelation. 
It seems worth while to note this, because 
a common assumption of the opponents of 
Socialism is that every socialist must hold 
to Marx or, socialistically speaking, be 
damned. Nothing could be more absurd. 
However, it might be remarked that Marx was 
no mean prophet regarding the present war. 
In 1870, three days after Sedan, he wrote: 
" Whoever is not totally stupefied by the noise 
of the moment, or has no interest in stupefy- 
ing others, must realize that the war of 1870 
bears within its womb the necessity of a war 
with Russia. . . If they [Germany] take 
Alsace-Lorraine, then Russia and France will 
make war on Germany. It is superfluous to 
point out the disastrous results." 

Second, clear and abundant evidence is pre- 
sented here to prove what is now pretty gener- 
ally admitted: that despite the lapses of 
occasional groups into jingoism or junkerism 
or Chauvinism, socialists have been both in 
season and out of season the season of war 
fever the pioneers and champions of peace. 
On July 30, 1914, at the demonstration of the 
Internationalist Socialist Bureau in Brussels, 
the German delegate Haase said : 

" The Austrian ultimatum was then, in reality, 
an actual provocation for a war both longed for 
and awaited. Servians answer was, it is known, 
drawn up in a spirit so moderate that if good 
faith were admissible on the part of the Aus- 
trians, peace would be assured. Austria wanted 
war. But what is so dreadful is the fact that this 
criminal madness can cover all Europe with blood. 
. . The German proletariat contends that Germany 
ought not to intervene even if Russia should in- 
tervene." 

What French socialists thought before the 
violation of Belgium is seen in the words of 
the martyred Jaures on the same occasion: 
"As for ourselves, it is our duty to insist that 
the government speak forcibly enough to Rus- 
sia to make her keep hands off. But if Russia 
unfortunately should not take notice, our duty 
is to say, ' We know but one treaty, the treaty 
that binds us to the human race.' " It is not 
difficult to conceive why a Chauvinistic 
France demanded the life of the author of 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



57 



this unpatriotic sentiment. Everywhere one 
can read the same stubborn story. On August 
1, 1914, after the outbreak of the war against 
Austria, the Servian socialists in Parliament 
refused their support to the government. In 
1911 the sole socialist deputy in the Bulgarian 
Assembly, Sakasoff, cast the only ballot 
against war. Marx and Engels were not 
pacificists, and practically all socialists believe 
with Bebel in purely defensive war ; yet it is 
marvellous how long, in the present world- 
madness, their internationalism kept them 
sane. For instance, Mr. J. Ramsay Macdon- 
ald, Chairman of the Labor Party in England, 
in an article in " The Labor Leader " of 
August 13 last, " excused Germany's declara- 
tion of war against Russia and France, and 
put upon England the chief responsibility for 
the war between England and Germany." 
The best statement of the tragic socialist fail- 
ure, despite everything, to keep out of the 
war, is found in the "Arbeiter Zeitung" rep- 
resenting the Austrian socialists : 

" In all countries we Socialists, German, French, 
English, Belgian, Austrian, Servian, have done 
our duty as internationalists, as long as it was 
possible; we warned against the war, and with 
every drop of our blood have sought to hinder it; 
and we tried to make use of every possible chance 
of maintaining peace up to the very last minute. 

" But since Fate has overtaken us and over- 
come us, the proletariat in all countries, which 
formerly did its international duty, now does its 
duty as sons of its people, who risk everything 
in order that the people shall not be conquered, in 
order that its soil will not be delivered to the 
horrors of a defeat. We all suffer wrong; we 
all do right to protect ourselves against it. . . 
But even in this tragic moment we do not forget 
that we are International Social Democrats. Our 
hearts bleed because of the frightful necessity of 
this conflict, but we give to our people and to 
the State what belongs to the people and the 
State." 

This is clearly meant to apply in justification, 
not of Austrian socialists alone, but of all 
combatants. No franker, braver, or more chari- 
table utterance has been evoked by the war. 
Third, it becomes clear that socialists have 
no stereotyped diagnosis and panacea for war. 
While they believe with Mr. Morris Hillquit 
" that modern wars are mainly caused by the 
industrial competition between nations," wide 
variations in emphasis appear. Kautsky, 
"the intellectual leader" of German radical 
socialists, thinks "that there may develop in 
the present war a combination of the stronger 
nations which will put an end to the competi- 
tive building of armaments." Thus war 
would be ended not by Socialism, but by a 
developed capitalism. Otto Bauer attributes 



war squarely to Nationalism, the economic in- 
terests of all classes. On the other hand the 
majority of the French socialists, including 
Jaures, announced at Stuttgart in 1907 : 
" Militarism is to be viewed exclusively as the 
arming of the State in order to keep the work- 
ing classes in political and economic subjec- 
tion to the capitalist class." Needless to say, 
this is also a common view in Russia. 

Fourth, it is demonstrated absolutely that 
the German socialists were not a unit in the 
support of the government at the outbreak of 
the war, and that there is a strong and grow- 
ing opposition in the party to the war's con- 
tinuance. Geyer of Saxony led a strong 
minority, 37 to 52, against the war budget of 
1913; and the majority voted for it solely 
because it called for a direct tax upon the 
capitalist class, thus coinciding with their 
principles. On December 2, when Karl Lieb- 
knecht was the only member of the Reichstag 
to vote " no " to the second war loan, he was 
not the only socialist to think " no." Twenty- 
five stood by him in the Party Congress, and 
fourteen of these absented themselves when 
the vote was taken, indicating in the only' 
legitimate socialist manner their dissent to the 
majority. At the voting of the third loan on 
March 20, Ruehle stood with Liebknecht, and 
thirty other party members stayed away. 
" Vorwaerts," the most powerful organ of 
German Socialism, has never defended the 
Reichstag vote, and has opposed the war up to 
the extreme limit of the censor's blue pencil. 

Fifth, it is perfectly clear why the majority 
of German socialists support the righteousness 
of the cause of enlightened Germany against 
the encroachments of Russia. 

Sixth, socialists in every belligerent coun- 
try are divided roughly into two groups : de- 
fenders of the war as defensive, and a minority 
sternly pointing to the same issues they have 
always pointed out, commercial rivalry and 
militarism. In each country, with the ex? 
ception of France, where the completest una- 
nimity against the German invasion exists, 
certain prominent socialists arraign their own 
government with the same impersonal justice 
that is to be found in neutral countries. 
" Vorwaerts " in Germany, Messrs. Ramsay 
Macdonald and Keir Hardie and Bernard 
Shaw in England, and Martoff in Russia illus- 
trate this remarkable socialist sanity. 

Seventh, socialists in neutral countries de- 
sire Germany to be successful against 'despotic 
Russia, but not against democratic England 
and republican France. The Poles, to be sure, 
feel that there is little choice between Russ 
and Pruss. An article in " The American 
Socialist" of January 9, 1915, sums up the 



58 



THE DIAL 



[ July 15 



American view on this point : " Whatever the 
cause of human progress may gain through a 
punishment of Prussian militarism, it will 
lose a hundredfold through a victory of Rus- 
sian despotism." Mr. Hillquit is for a draw 
and a return to the status quo, while Mr. Debs, 
and also evidently Mr. Walling, are strongly 
opposed to such a no-termination. An inter- 
esting passage from Betel's Memoirs reads 
like an extract from Norman Angell's thesis 
in " The Great Illusion " : " My view is that 
defeat in war is rather advantageous than dis- 
advantageous to a people in our unfree condi- 
tion. Victories make a government that 
stands opposed to a people arrogant and exact- 
ing. Defeats compel them to approach the 
people and win their sympathy." The back- 
ground is very different from Norman An- 
gell's, but the conclusion is identical ; and by 
the same token, diametrically opposed to that 
of Plechanoff, who thinks that a German vic- 
tory over Russia would mean "an almost 
indefinite triumph of Russian despotism." 

Eighth, socialist peace plans have thus far, 
through mutual distrust and international 
war divorcements, proved as frustrate as any 
others. Little can or need be said on this 
topic. The end is not yet. 

One further question is of prime interest. 
It has been said by socialist and non-socialist 
press alike that the exigencies of war have 
forced several of the governments engaged to 
adopt socialist measures. Is this true? Yes 
and no. Take two prominent illustrations. 
State Socialism in Germany was undoubtedly 
making rapid progress before the war, through 
graduated inheritance and income taxes and 
taxes on the unearned increment in land. The 
war chest was filled by a direct tax on capital, 
even amounting to confiscation. To raise the 
immense amounts necessary to pay interest on 
the war loan, it will be necessary to increase 
taxes of this sort. This would tend to redis- 
tribute large fortunes, and would really 
amount to Socialism. "Vorwaerts," on the 
other hand, stamps as a dangerous illusion the 
tendency to regard government organization 
of industry for war purposes as socialistic. 
Government ownership, as Kautsky points out 
in "Die neue Zeit," gained by purchase at 
the market price and not by confiscation, has 
no vital resemblance to Socialism. 

Again, it is asserted that the British Gov- 
ernment, in nationally organizing the rail- 
roads of 'the United Kingdom at the beginning 
of the war, took a long step toward Socialism. 
In a sense that is true. It was shown how 
easy and natural such a change could be 
effected. But at the core this measure no more 
resembles Socialism than does martial law. 



The government agreed to pay the railroads 
" the sum by which the aggregate net receipts 
of the railways for the period during which 
the government is in possession of them, fall 
short of the aggregate net receipts for the 
corresponding period for 1913 " ; also to guar- 
antee them against any injury they might sus- 
tain, thus providing the railways assurance of 
kindly government aid in making long de- 
ferred improvements. Only the worst enemy 
of Socialism would see a real resemblance here. 
However, as Mr. Lloyd-George has pointed 
out, " the British people are essentially a peo- 
ple who act on example and experiment rather 
than on argument," and other peoples are 
pretty much of the same stripe; so if these 
various experiments in nationalization and 
municipalization prove successful, there is 
reason to expect that in the future they will 
become what they are not now, socialistic.

RELICS OF THE BROXZE AGE LV GREECE.* 

Mr. H. R. Hall's "introduction to the 
archaeology of prehistoric Greece" is written 
by an assistant in the British Museum, and 
forms one of the volumes in a series of man- 
uals of archaeology of different lands. The 
culture which it considers was first brought 
into prominent notice by Schliemann's finds at 
Mycenae. It has been made more fully known 
by later investigations, to some degree in the 
Greek mainland but principally in Crete and 
the Cyclades. No archaeological studies have 
produced greater surprises, or forced more 
far-reaching criticism of earlier-held views. 
The culture known as Mycenaean in Greece 
proper is Minoan in Crete and Cycladic in 
the smaller islands. The term JEgean of our 
author includes the three phases and is a con- 
venient general designation. The time period 
covered by it, determined largely by compari- 
son with Egyptian evidence of fixed date, 
seems to have ended about 1200 B. c. and to 
run back to the time of the pyramid builders, 
perhaps about 3000 B. c. As a whole, the cul- 
ture represents the "bronze age," and is of 
remarkable beauty and interest and has had a 
great influence. As regards nomenclature, the 
Minoan culture, the full Cretan development, 
is divided into three main divisions Early, 
Middle, and Late, each of which is subdi- 
vided into three lesser divisions L, II., III. 
Thus we may speak of E.M. II. or L.M.IIL, 
meaning Early Minoan middle, or Late Mi- 
noan end. The Cycladic culture parallels the

Minoan, and its subdivision gives rise to ex- 
pressions like M.C.I, and L. C. II. Myce- 
naean culture is relatively late, and corresponds 
only to Late Minoan, so its terminology de- 
mands but three expressions, Myc. I., Myc. II., 
Myc. III. 

Mr. Hall devotes a long early chapter to the 
history of exploration and discovery from 
Schliemann down to the present. Workers 
of many nationalities have been engaged in 
the fascinating pursuit, the most famous being 
Arthur Evans, of England. Americans are 
justly proud of the work done by Harriet Boyd 
(-Hawes), whose excavations at Gournia were 
of high character. A number of Greeks have 
been industrious, and have made valuable con- 
tribution. In following chapters, there is 
presented a detailed study of the archaeo- 
logical material unearthed, stone, metal, 
pottery, towns, houses, palaces, fortresses, tem- 
ples, tombs, decoration, painting, sculpture, 
hieroglyphic system, weights and measures, 
costume, armor, weapons, tools, ships, and 
domestic animals, being among the more im- 
portant topics considered. We can here make 
but a few comments upon this material. In- 
teresting and characteristic are stone vessels 
of the E.M. and E.G. cultures. Vases and 
lidded boxes are among the forms; graves of 
E. M. III. age at Mochlos " yielded innumera- 
ble small vases of multicolored stone, steatite, 
marble, and breccia, wrought with the utmost 
skill, and using the actual veins of the stone 
to form a coherent pattern." Beautiful metal 
work was done in gold, silver, and bronze. 
While the famous gold cups from Vaphio per- 
haps still remain the masterpieces of the 
^Egean goldsmith's art, lovely specimens 
found at other localities come as close seconds. 
They are wonderfully attractive in their grace 
and beauty of form, and in the boldness and 
delicacy of tjeir repousse ornamentation. In 
all the art work of this culture, the student 
constantly comes upon charming examples of 
the law of copy and this often in strangely 
unexpected ways. Thus, the potter of the 
M. M. imitated metal vases in form, and stone 
vessels both in form and color "the varie- 
gated hues of the stone vases were imitated 
and polychromy first appeared in the JEgean 
ceramic." Another interesting, and unex- 
pected, exemplification of the law of copy is 
to be seen in steatite vessels upon the surface 
of which the repousse decoration of gold vases 
is imitated. In the decoration of metal work, 
splendid raised designs represent groups of 
men and animals in action, and throw a flood 
of light upon the life of the time. In pottery, 
the culture finds remarkable expression: the 
art can be traced in its whole development, 



step by step ; form, decoration, color handling, 
polychromy, show the working out of an exu- 
berant fancy. The representation of sea ani- 
mals in color design is remarkable : " the accu- 
rate observation of the artist shews itself in 
the splendid impressions of octopods, squids 
and nautili, tritons, anemones, seapens and 
shells, amid jagged rocks from which seaweed 
waves, which cover the best vases of this age." 
Where such mastery was gained in the appli- 
cation of color designs to the surfaces of 
vessels, there is no reason for surprise that 
mural decoration flourished. 

No subject, however, in JEgean archaeology 
surpasses the written system in interest. This 
was discovered and investigated by Mr. Evans. 
It presents itself as cut on seal-stones and 
scratched or pressed on clay tablets. Two 
periods in the development of the script are 
recognized. The earlier, pictographic char- 
acters, on seal-stones, may date back to 3000 
B. c. ; the latest script is from about 1200 B. c. 
Sir Arthur Evans connects the Cretan-^Egeau 
script with the Cypriote syllabary, and sug- 
gests that the Phoenician alphabet (with its 
Greek and Latin descendants) owes its origin 
to the Cretan script. While the characters 
have been identified and their evolution has 
been traced, their decipherment has not been 
accomplished. The numeral signs have been 
worked out, but we do not even know whether 
the syllabic characters represent the sounds of 
an Aryan or a non- Aryan language. 

It must be evident from what we have said 
that the matter of Mr. Hall's book is of ex- 
traordinary interest; unfortunately his pre- 
sentation of it is dry and heavy. The book is 
amply and beautifully illustrated. In closing 
his work, the author presents a brief summary 
of conclusions. Crete was the centre of ^Egean 
culture, and its whole history is to be traced 
there. To a remarkable degree it underwent 
an independent and individual development. 
From Crete, it passed into Greece, gaining a 
foothold in the Peloponnese and spreading out 
from there as a new centre. Crete itself prob- 
ably received population and the beginnings 
of its art from Africa the Nile valley, 
and always remained to some degree in touch 
with Egypt. "The ^gean culture was a 
maritime one, the civilization of a sailor- 
people of the islands, and its progress was 
rendered possible only by the sea. By the 
sea it lived, and when a stronger people com- 
ing from the North, and bringing with it the 
use of iron, dispossessed the J3geans of the 
exclusive control of the seaways their power 
collapsed, and with it the great civilization of 
which we have described the remains."

AN AMERICAN DKAMA OF THE ISTH 
CENTURY.* 



"Ponteaeh, or The Savages of America," 
often described as the first tragedy written by 
an American on an American subject, has 
hitherto been available only in the original 
London edition of 1766, of which but five 
copies are known to be in existence. By re- 
printing the play with an introduction, a bib- 
liography, and an elaborate biography of the 
author, the Caxton Club of Chicago has ren- 
dered a service to students of American litera- 
ture, even though the chief interest of the 
editor, Mr. Allan Nevins, is evidently in his- 
torical rather than in literary questions. The 
attractive appearance of the volume is highly 
creditable to its sponsors. 

Colonel Robert Rogers, the author of the 
play, was born in Methuen on the Massachu- 
setts frontier in 1731. As a mere boy he saw 
service in Indian conflicts, and while still a 
young man became a noted leader of rangers 
in the French and Indian wars. In 1760 he 
was appointed to receive the submission of the 
French posts on the Great Lakes, and it was 
on his journey westward for this purpose that 
he first met Chief Pontiac. His fame by this 
time was such that the next year he was 
hastily summoned, only six days after his mar- 
riage, to take part in the campaign against 
the Cherokees in the Carolinas. Two years 
later, on the re-opening of hostilities in the 
North, he fought against Pontiac at Detroit. 
In 1765 he went to England, where his two 
prose .works, the Journals and the " Concise 
Account of North America," were published. 
" Ponteach " followed early in 1766. He re- 
turned to America as governor of Mackinac, 
and in the administration of this post became 
engaged in controversies with Sir William 
Johnson. Later he went to England to plead 
his cause, possibly served a few months in 
Algiers, and returned to America to take a 
slight part, on the British side, in the Revolu- 
tion. The later years of his life were spent 
obscurely as a half-pay colonel in London, 
where he died in 1795. 

The private character of this picturesque 
soldier is of little concern to the student of 
his tragedy; yet the casual reader of Mr. 
Nevins's portrayal may be tempted to protest 
against what seems a tendency to use the 
blackest possible colors. The biographer's 
habitual treatment of motives may be seen 
from the following quotations chosen almost 
at random : " In the Browne home, Rogers 
met and fell in love with the youngest daugh-

ter, Elizabeth, a beautiful girl of nineteen, 
and into this domestic circle he determined to 
push himself. Apart from all reasons of sen- 
timent, he could have taken no step more 
advantageous" (p. 74); "Certificates of his 
usefulness and bravery he secured from al- 
most every considerable American leader 
during the Seven Years War, Amherst, 
Abercrombie, Howe, Moncton, Webb, Lou- 
doun, Eglinton, and others; some of them, 
delivered with an alacrity strongly suggestive 
of jealousy of Gage and Johnson, added warm 
personal recommendations to the more per- 
functory testimonials " (pp. 147-8) . That the 
dashing young ranger who had fallen in love 
with a beautiful girl married her only to push 
himself into the family of a Portsmouth 
clergyman, or that the most distinguished 
generals in America were guilty of praising 
Rogers only to warm a grudge against some 
one else seem gratuitous assumptions. There 
is no doubt that Rogers had, probably in high 
degree, the improvidence and the personal 
vices often developed by the frontiersman and 
the soldier. But it is difficult to see how a 
man completely sunk in dissipation could 
have attained the self-culture which Rogers 
shows; or how so despicable a character as 
Mr. Nevins pictures could have held for years 
the respect and friendship of Indians, traders, 
army officers, and leaders of the British gov- 
ernment. 

The authorship of "Ponteach" has at 
times seemed open to some doubt, partly be- 
cause the Indians are portrayed in a way 
hardly to be expected of a frontier fighter; 
partly, perhaps, because the copy most readily 
accessible to scholars, that in the British 
Museum, contains an early manuscript entry 
ascribing it to " Richd. Rogers." All such 
doubts, so far as they concern the main re- 
sponsibility for the work, Mr. Nevins seems 
effectively to have set at rest. He points out 
that the estimate of Indian character in the 
appendix to the " Concise Account " is essen- 
tially that which pervades the play. He also 
quotes from a writer in " The Critical Review " 
who in discussing the " Concise Account " 
said : " The picture exhibited of the Emperor 
Pontiac is novel and interesting, and would 
appear to vast advantage in the hands of a 
great dramatic genius." It was some four 
months after this hint that "Ponteach" was 
issued by John Millan, who had published 
Rogers's other works; and although its au- 
thorship was never acknowledged, it was 
almost universally ascribed by the London 
critics to Rogers. 

As a work of literary art " Ponteach " is 
negligible. As Mr. Nevins remarks, it is un-

likely that Rogers had attended a stage per- 
formance before he reached London, and he 
had probably read few plays. The plot as 
distinguished from the setting is weak and 
conventional. The form is a rude blank 
verse, with occasional rhymed passages. An 
amusing indication of the author's provincial 
pronunciation is perhaps found in what looks 
like an attempt to rhyme " home " and " gun " 
(Act. I. Sc. II.). The diction is often collo- 
quial to an extent that was more troublesome 
to the London critics of 1766 than it is to us. 
Yet different passages of the play, in par- 
ticular, different Indian speeches, vary so 
much in tone as to suggest the possibility of a 
double authorship. The first act is the rough- 
est and most direct. In Act I., Sc. III. occurs 
the following dialogue between Ponteach and 
the English Commander: 

" Ponteach. Well, Mr. Colonel Cockum, what d' 

they call you? 

You give no Answer yet to my Complaint; 
Your Men give my Men always too much Rum, 
Then trade and cheat 'em. What! d'ye think this 

right? 
" Cockum. Tush ! Silence ! hold your noisy 

cursed Nonsense; 
I've heard enough of it; what is it to me? 

"Ponteach. What! you a Colonel, and not 

command your Men? 

Let ev'ry one be a Rogue that has a Mind to 't. 
" Cockum. Why, curse your Men, I suppose 

they wanted Rum ; 

They'll rarely be content, I know, without it. 
" Ponteach. What then ? If Indians are such 

Fools, I think 

White Men like you should stop and teach them 
better. 

"Cockum. You may be d d, and all your 

Frenchmen too. 

"Ponteach. Bed d! what's that? I do not 

understand." 

In contrast to this is the absurd discourse of 
the Indian maiden to her lover in Act III., 
Sc. I. : 

" The Earth itself is sometimes known to shake, 
And the bright Sun by Clouds is oft conceal'd, 
And gloomy Night succeeds the Smiles of Day 
So Beauty oft by foulest Faults is veil'd, 
And after one short Blaze admir'd no more, 
Loses its Lustre, drops its sparkling Charms, 
The Lover sickens, and his Passion dies. 
Nay worse, he hates what he so doted on. 
Time only proves the Truth of Worth and Love, 
The one may be a cheat, the other change, 
And Fears, and Jealousies, and mortal Hate, 
Succeed the Sunshine of the warmest Passion." 

A speech like that just quoted may have been 
composed with the aid of some hack writer, or, 
as Mr. Nevins suggests, of Rogers's secretary, 



Nathaniel Potter; but the pictures of fron- 
tier life and the portrayal of Indian character 
are clearly Rogers's own. 

There is room for a study of the treatment 
of the Indian in literature which shall con- 
sider how far the interpretation of aboriginal 
character has been determined by the tem- 
perament and the social philosophy of indi- 
vidual writers. In the preparation of such a 
study " Ponteach " will be a valuable docu- 
ment. From the earliest times there have 
been two extreme opinions that the "noble 
red man " was in his native state possessed of 
every essential virtue, and that " the only 
good Indian is a dead Indian." Neither of 
these views has been confined either to the 
frontiersmen who knew the Indian intimately, 
or to the city-dwelling disciples of Rousseau. 
Colonel Rogers was a man whose life from 
early boyhood had been spent in fighting 
Indians, yet who felt that they were essen- 
tially noble, and that they had been the vic- 
tims of cruelty and fraud. In his play the 
French priest is licentious, the British traders 
are cheats, the hunters are murderers, the 
military officers Cockum and Frisk are super- 
cilious and insulting, and the governors, 
Sharp, Gripe, and Catchum, are all that their 
names imply. Of the Indians, Philip is a 
villain; but the others, though showing hu- 
man weaknesses, command our sympathy, and 
Ponteach is really noble. Rogers undoubtedly 
believed that the French plan of mingling on 
terms of equality with the Indians was better 
than the English show of authority and supe- 
riority, but he wrote in no sense as a propa- 
gandist. He seems to have interpreted the 
Indians in the light of his own temperament ; 
and if he did, his work is a commentary both 
on the Indian character and on his own. 

As Colonel Rogers was far more important 
as ranger and frontiersman than as author, it 
would be unfair to blame Mr. Nevins for mak- 
ing his biographical sketch an historical 
rather than a literary monograph. Yet it may 
be pointed out that he has not traced so far 
as he might parallelisms between the play and 
Rogers's prose works ; and that he has left for 
later students the tasks of searching for the 
models that the author used in preparing his 
plot, and of comparing his treatment of the 
Indians with that of other English writers of 
the hour. Anyone who is but slightly famil- 
iar with English magazines in the decade in 
which " Ponteach " appeared has noticed how 
much space is given to American matters, 
including those which concerned the Indians. 
The fact that " Ponteach " itself seemed worth 
the attention if not the approbation of Lon- 
doners is shown in the fact that " The Gentle-

THE NEW SPIRIT IN AMERICAN POLITICS.* 



To the many extant interpretations of pro- 
gressivism in contemporary American politics 
President Wilson's " The New Freedom," 
Mr. Weyl's " The New Democracy," and Mr. 
Croly's " Progressive Democracy," to men- 
tion but three has lately been added Mr. 
Benjamin P. De Witt's " The Progressive 
Movement." Mr. De Witt writes sympa- 
thetically, but \\dth a due measure of re- 
straint; and he fixes the scope of his subject 
broadly and sanely. He very truly says that 
so much attention has been given to the rise 
and development of the Progressive party in 
the United States that there has been a ten- 
dency to overlook the larger and more funda- 
mental movement of which it is a part a 
movement which had struck its roots far back 
in the past and had assumed formidable pro- 
portions before the campaign of 1912 began. 

" The progressive movement is broader than the 
Progressive party and, in fact, than any single 
party. It is the embodiment and expression of 
fundamental measures and principles of reform 
that have been advocated for many years by all 
political parties. Although differences in name, 
in the specific reforms advocated, and in the 
emphasis placed upon them, have obscured the 
identity of the movement, the underlying purposes 
and ideals of the progressive elements of all 
parties for the past quarter of a century have 
been essentially the same. To make clear this uni- 
versal character of the progressive movement is 
one of the objects for which this book has been 
written." 

The common substratum of progressivism 
in all political parties is declared by Mr. 
De Witt to consist in three main tendencies: 
(1) insistence by the better element that 
special, minority, and corrupt influence in 
government national, state, and city be 
removed; (2) the demand that the structure 
or machinery of government, which hitherto 
has been admirably adapted to control of the 
few, be so modified that it will be more diffi- 
cult for the few, and easier for the many, to 
control; and (3) the rapidly growing convic- 
tion that the functions of government at pres- 
ent are too restricted and that they must be 
increased and extended to relieve social and

hensive Discussion of Current Tendencies in American 
Politics. By Benjamin P. De Witt. New York : The Mac-

economic distress. These three tendencies, 
with varying emphasis, are seen to-day in the 
platform and programme of every political 
party; they are manifested in the political 
changes and reforms that are advocated and 
made in the nation, the states, and the cities; 
and, because of their universality and defi- 
niteness, they may be said .to constitute the 
real progressive movement. 

Mr. De Witt's method is both historical 
and analytical. Following a chapter devoted 
to the meaning and general aspects of the 
history of the progressive movement, he 
writes at some length of the movement in 
each of the five principal parties of the pres- 
ent day, that is, the Democratic, the Kepub- 
lican, the Progressive, the Socialist, and the 
Prohibitionist. Thereupon he turns to the 
development and the achievements of pro- 
gressivism in the nation, in the states, and in 
the municipalities. It is these later portions 
of the book that are most valuable. The 
earlier chapters comprise only rapid sketches 
of recent and familiar party history. The 
later ones, however, summarize in a helpful 
manner recent triumphs of progressive prin- 
ciples and characterize pending problems in- 
volving the application of progressive ideas. 

We are told that the progressive movement 
is not so far advanced in the nation as it is in 
the states, and that therefore so far as the 
nation is concerned emphasis must be placed 
primarily upon the preliminary steps of gov- 
ernment and corporation control, while in the 
states these matters are becoming more and 
more incidental to the extension of the func- 
tions of government to afford social, economic, 
and industrial relief. In the city, while the 
broader phases of the movement are the same 
as in the states, there are some differences of 
emphasis. In the first place, the city must 
be made free from the domination of the 
state legislature must, in other words, have 
municipal home rule. In the second place, 
the city must adopt that form of charter that 
will afford to its voters the largest oppor- 
tunity for direct and effective participation 
in municipal affairs. Furthermore, the gov- 
ernment of the city must be put upon a 
business basis, with much stress upon efficient 
and economical organization and methods. 
Finally, the functions of city government 
must be extended to promote the welfare and 
comfort of the inhabitants so far as is com- 
patible with free government and democratic 
institutions. The municipal programme out- 
lined in the closing chapters is attractive, and 
considerable portions of it are being carried 
into execution to-day in many cities.

RECENT FICTION.* 

Mr. Churchill has the lecture habit in an 
aggravated form, and it is seriously impair- 
ing his function as a novelist in any artistic 
ense. Probably he will not be much stirred 
by this criticism, for when a man thinks that 
lie sees a gigantic evil, and feels that he has 
.a mission to expose and overthrow it, he is 
apt to be somewhat reckless of the means 
employed. If he happens to be a popular 
novelist, he will unhesitatingly jettison the 
equipment which makes for lasting literary 
.achievement, and ram the object of his attack 
at the risk of sinking his own craft. Mr. 
Churchill clearly believes that he has such a 
mission, and employs all his persuasiveness 
to impress his readers with its importance. 
In " The Inside of the Cup," his attack was 
upon the hypocrisy which makes of religion 
a crust without substance; in "A Far Coun- 
try," his artillery is aimed at the methods of 
""big business" in the modern American 
world. We do not say that he has lost all 
sense of the artistic demands made upon him 
as a novelist, but he has distinctly subordi- 
nated them to the purpose of preaching an 
effective sermon. Of his earnestness there 
can be no doubt, and he does not scold his 
fellow-men for their lack of vision in the 
monotonous manner of Mr. H. G. "Wells, but 
he makes himself wearisome by excess of 
argument, and he distorts the facts of life by 
excess of emphasis. There are, heaven knows, 
evils enough in the business world of to-day, 
and the moralist, even if he be a writer of 
fiction, is justified in making them his target, 
but the rapier of indirection and suggestion 
is far more likely to reach their vitals than 
the bludgeon, the sling and the " five smooth 
stones" than the "weaver's beam." Briefly, 
""A Far Country" is the autobiography of 
Hugh Paret, son of a lawyer of the old school 
of high ethical standards, and himself a law- 
yer of the new school which promotes cor- 
porations, grabs franchises, and corrupts 
courts and legislatures. He believes in the 
new business gospel of efficiency, and is per- 
suaded that the small group of financiers to 
which he belongs is the group best fitted for 
leadership and for mastery of the political 
and industrial life of the nation. Actual con-

temporary history will no doubt supply chap- 
ter and verse for every one of the nefarious 
activities whereby Paret acquires wealth and 
commanding influence, but the men of his 
type illustrate only one aspect albeit a sin- 
ister one of the American business life of 
to-day. It is well that this aspect of life 
should be exposed in all its vicious ugliness, 
but it is not well that these methods should 
be presented as universally prevailing. The 
pointing of Mr. Churchill's moral is a con- 
tinuous process. Even in Paret's most suc- 
cessful hours, he has stirrings of a better 
nature that make him uncomfortable, and in 
the end, through the influence of the radical 
agitator Krebs, who has antagonized him 
throughout his career, he experiences a revul- 
sion of feeling in which the bitter truth is 
brought home to him that his success has been 
but as dust and ashes in the mouth. He real- 
izes the meaning of the old text about the 
futility of gaining the whole world if a man 
thereby loses his own soul, and tardily sets 
about the recovery of his soul before it is lost 
forever. Two women are intimately asso- 
ciated with his fortunes the one whom he 
marries only to become estranged from her, 
and the one for whom he entertains a guilty 
passion without being dragged beyond the 
verge of the precipice. The necessity for 
renunciation, caused by this woman's native 
strength of character, becomes the instru- 
ment of his conversion, and turns his groping 
steps backward from the "far country" in 
which his manhood life has been spent, bring- 
ing him once more within sight of a region 
of simpler and saner ideals. This study of 
an erring soul, perplexed in the extreme by 
the amazing discovery that worldly success 
does not bring spiritual satisfaction, makes a 
strong appeal to our sympathies, despite its 
many desert tracts of self-analysis, despite 
the encumbrance of a mass of insignificant 
detail, and despite the handicap of a literary 
style that rarely has the note of distinction, 
and has stodginess for its chief characteristic. 
The type of whimsical humor w r hich makes 
an intellectual appeal is the salient character- 
istic of Mr. Locke's later work, and is once 
more exemplified in "Jaffery." It enables 
him to invest an exotic character with human 
interest, and to lend probability to a situation 
which the logical mind would be forced to 
reject as beyond the pale of possibility. Both 
these audacious feats are here accomplished, 
the one in the case of the Albanian heroine 
Liosha, and the other in the success (for a 
time) of Jaffery 's device for sparing the feel- 
ings of the woman he adores by covering up 



64

the fraudulent literary career of her deceased 
husband. Adrian Boldero finds among the 
possessions of a dead comrade the manuscript 
of a complete novel. This he publishes under 
his own name, thereby gaining both fame and 
wealth. He also gains Doria, who marries 
him, worships him as a genius, and envelopes 
him in an atmosphere of incense. He prom- 
ises his publishers a second novel, but is 
utterly incapable of writing it, and wears his 
life out (aided by many potations) in the 
effort to perform his impossible task. His 
widow believes that he has finished this sec- 
ond work, and it lies with Jaffery to safe- 
guard her delusion. Thereupon he writes the 
novel himself, gives it to the publishers as 
Boldero 's work, and it repeats the success of 
the first production. It is true that the pub- 
lic is puzzled by the new theme and the new 
style, but no doubt is cast upon the authen- 
ticity of the authorship. Such a thing is, of 
course, frankly impossible, for Jaffery is a 
burly, explosive, Rabelaisian person, having 
not a single intellectual trait in common with 
Boldero, but Mr. Locke almost makes the 
reader accept it. Of course Doria has to dis- 
cover the double imposition, and her clay idol 
has to come down from his pedestal. Mean- 
while, Jaffery discovers that his true mate is 
Liosha, and that his love for Doria has been 
a delusion. Doria deserves nothing better 
than this, for she is a very silly, selfish, and 
parasitical young woman, and one feels like 
shaking Jaffery for his dog-like attendance 
upon her footsteps. As for Liosha, she is 
indescribable at any less length than the 
novel itself. Born of Albanian parents in the 
Chicago stock yards, her later years of life 
among her ancestral mountains have not 
obliterated the Chicago idiom from her 
speech. When Jaffery, who is a war corre- 
spondent in the Balkans, comes into her life, 
she is the wife (and soon thereafter the 
widow) of one of his fellow- journalists. She 
is left in Jaffery's charge, and he brings her 
to England. The people who attempt to civi- 
lize her she characterizes as " damn fools," 
she is disposed to stick a knife into any one 
who crosses her will, and her manners are, to 
say the least, primitive. These traits, added 
to her Amazonian frame, make her a terror 
in more senses than one, and we are led to 
regard her as a comic diversion rather than 
as a serious heroine of romance. But Mr. 
Locke has made up his mind that we shall 
take her seriously, and in the end almost 
makes us accept her as the life companion 
predestined for Jaffery. The unblushing 
sophistication with which Jaffery's relations 
with Doria and Liosha are set forth may be 



seen in the following quotation : " He imag- 
ined himself to be in love with a moonbeam. 
And the moonbeam shot like a glamorous, 
enchanted sword between him and Liosha, 
and kept them apart until the moment of 
dazed revelation, when he saw that the moon- 
beam was merely a pale, earnest, anxious, 
suffering little human thing, alien to his 
every instinct, a firmament away, in every 
vital essential, from the goddess of his idola- 
try." It will be seen from the preceding 
remarks that "Jaffery" is to be read with 
an undercurrent of subconscious protest 
against the tricks of the author's invention ; 
but for all that, J;he story is no less capti- 
vating than its predecessors, and we would 
not for anything have missed our acquain- 
tance with either Jaffery or his Albanian 
charge. 

The six hundred pages of " Empty Pock- 
ets," by Mr. Rupert Hughes, may be recom- 
mended as providing ideal entertainment for 
the vacation leisure of any reader who wishes 
to avoid the strenuous, yet who demands 
tense and sustained interest of his fiction. 
Something is happening all the time in these 
pages, and their manifold incidents are 
woven into a fabric of close texture which 
never allows the pattern of the plot to escape 
the eye. There is also much lively humor of 
the journalistic sort which works its effects 
by unanticipated similitudes and quaint tricks 
of expression. The story is concerned with a 
murder mystery, and the first fifty pages 
supply the stage-setting and the climax. 
Then the author steps a year backward, and 
proceeds to pick up the threads of the com- 
plication, and to show us exactly how it came 
about that the body of Perry Merrithew, New 
York clubman and rake, was found one 
morning in the summer of 1914, upon the 
roof of a tenement building in the slums of 
the East Side, his skull fractured, and his 
fists tightly clenching the strands of copper- 
colored hair which some woman had cut away 
for the purpose of freeing herself. After 
some five hundred pages of narration, we are 
brought to the point at which the story began, 
and thence proceed swiftly to the close, to 
learn that Merrithew had really died of 
apoplexy at the very moment of an attempted 
outrage upon the woman, and that she had 
been guilty of no other crime than self- 
defence against his attack. This is a com- 
forting revelation, for the heroine, the daugh- 
ter of one of New York's wealthiest families, 
is a very charming girl, and her indiscretions 
are really of the most innocent and warm- 
hearted description. During the narrative, 
four or five other red-haired girls are drawn

across the trail, and we are kept until near 
the end from getting on the right scent. 
When we learn that it was really Muriel who 
was Merrithew's companion on that midnight 
excursion into the slums, we receive a severe 
shock, for it is not until after that revelation 
that we are led to abandon the pre-conceived 
theory of murder for the explanation that 
rehabilitates the heroine and shows Merri- 
thew to have got no more than his deserts. 
Two aspects of metropolitan life alternate in 
claiming our interest. There is the pleasure- 
seeking aspect of the dinner-dance and the 
amusement resort, and there is the grim and 
sordid aspect of the underworld of poverty 
and vice and crime. Perhaps the most excit- 
ing episode is the kidnapping of Muriel by a 
gang of bandits, and the breathless taxicab 
race from the Bowery to the Bronx in which 
she is finally rescued by the pursuers. It all 
seems to have been transferred bodily from a 
film-melodrama to the pages of a book. Mr. 
Hughes is minutely realistic in both descrip- 
tion and dialogue, and his East Side types, 
in particular, are done to the life. We must 
hasten to add, however, that his characteriza- 
tions are purely external; of character- 
portrayal in the deeper sense, he does not 
give us a single instance, and his figures are 
no more life-like than the marionettes in a 
puppet-booth. He manifests, moreover, a 
cynical temper that is anything but whole- 
some, and his efforts to swing the satirical 
lash over the back of society are amusingly 
ineffective. But he has told a good story, in 
spite of its over-sophistication, and its read- 
ers will regret that it is too long to be read 
at a single stretch. 

A Catholic home for aged paupers provides 
the setting for Miss Florence Olmstead's "A 
Cloistered Romance." It is situated, we 
fancy, somewhere in rural New England, al- 
though that is a detail which does not greatly 
matter. The mother superior and the sisters 
are mostly of French extraction. One day 
the community mule Goliath, driven by one 
Samuel, who earns his keep by the perform- 
ance of such services for the sisterhood, gets 
out of hand, greatly to the peril of the sisters 
who occupy the wagon. At this critical mo- 
ment, a young man, who happens to be a 
popular novelist strolling along the country- 
side, springs to the rescue, and checks Goliath 
in his mad career, but is himself run over by 
the wagon and seriously injured. He is 
thereupon taken into the home, and given the 
attention his case requires. Now it so hap- 
pens that Miss Alethea Lawrence, a young 
woman of wealth and social standing, is a 
frequent visitor to the home, and its benefac- 



tress in many small ways, reading to the in- 
valids, and bringing them delicate things to 
eat. She is a very charming young woman, 
and when David Paget becomes the subject 
of her ministrations, he decides to play the 
game, and allow her to believe him as the 
others, a penniless dependant upon the 
sisters' charity. Thus begins the " cloistered 
romance " of Miss Olmstead's devising. How 
it ends is another matter, and one not difficult 
to imagine. David lingers in the home rather 
longer than is strictly necessary for his phy- 
sical needs, and when he takes a reluctant 
departure, reveals himself in his true colors 
by bestowing upon the institution a generous 
cheque for the building of the much-needed 
addition. The narrative is one of " humors " 
rather than of plot, and includes several char- 
acters who are an unfailing source of delight 
the bibulous and philosophical Samuel, the 
grouchy Mr. Shultz, the suspicious and gos- 
sipping Mary Giffin with her passion for 
chocolate crackers, the austere but very hu- 
man mother superior who will do anything 
for the sake of her pet cat Hafiz, and the 
efficient and sympathetic Sister Gertrude. 
Even Goliath provides a character-study of 
deep mulish interest. Aside from the artifice 
of the main complication, the story has all 
the naturalness of a transcript from real 
daily life, and the by-play of dialogue is 
inimitable. A brief example, with Mary 
Giffin in the foreground, may be given: 

" ' I had my day, Mr. Paget/ she said proudly, 
' an' she ain't nothin' to the handsomeness of me.' 

' I guess you must have been good-looking, 
Mary,' he admitted. 

' I was a corker ! ' said Mary. 'And think o' me 
takin' up with John Giffin, an' him dyin' without 
so much as a nickel's worth of insurance! I could 
er had Meggs's father, an' that would er meant an 
interest in the store.' 

' Is that all you think about, Mary ? ' 

' It comes to that sooner or later,' said Mary, 
' an' the sooner the better. If I'd a-thought about 
featherin' my nest, like some, I wouldn't be settin' 
in a Catholic home to-day. My people was hard- 
shell Baptis' long before anybody ever heard about 
Catholics.' 

' You needn't to look for no partic'lar luck in 
makin' wealthy connections. It don't come to the 
poor,' she added by way of warning." 

This novel seems to be rather dull at the out- 
set, but its insinuating charm gains upon the 
reader, and holds his interest more deeply 
with every added chapter. The freshness of 
its thematic material, and the knowledge of 
human nature which it displays at every 
point, added to its genuine humor, show us 
once more how the most commonplace of sub- 
jects may supply the artist with all that he

needs in the way of objective stimulus. The 
creative instinct will do the rest, as it notably 
does in the present instance. 

''Along came Ruth," and her appearance 
in the town of Freeport (Illinois?) had the 
effect qf a moral bombshell, Ruth had been a 
Freeport girl some ten years earlier, and had 
scandalized the community by running away 
with a married man, whose wife inconsid- 
erately refused to divorce him for Ruth's 
benefit. She returns because of her father's 
mortal illness, and her family and former 
associates make things very uncomfortable 
for her. This is the story of Miss Susan 
Glaspell's "Fidelity," a title which expresses 
Ruth's persistent belief that she has done 
nothing essentially wrong, and that all the 
people who refuse to take her back on the old 
terms are unfeeling pharisees. This is the 
plain unsophisticated statement of the moral 
situation presented by the novel. As Miss 
Glaspell puts it, Ruth is a noble creature, 
deeply misunderstood, and a victim of pro- 
vincial cant and hypocrisy. By every device 
of indirection and insinuation, this view is 
thrust upon us, and the woman's sin is 
glossed over. It seems to us a very unwhole- 
some story, and it is an amazingly dull one, 
made so by its interminable passages of 
analysis and introspection. We are spared 
nothing of what goes on in the minds of all 
these commonplace people, and chapter after 
chapter is spun out of their uninteresting 
reflections and mutual reactions. When Ruth 
returns to her paramour, she finds that his 
love has grown cold, and when the news comes 
of the divorce tardily consented to by the 
wronged wife, she rejects his offer to legalize 
her status, and deserts him to shape a new 
life for herself. So confused a study of moral 
values is not often met with, even in these 
days of "advanced" thought and chatter 
about " the rights of the soul." 

Our only war novel for this month is a 
crude and amateurish performance styled 
" L. P. M.," by Mr. J. Stewart Barney. This 
enigmatic title turns out to stand for " Little 
Peace Maker," which is the invention of a 
philanthropic American millionaire. This 
person, whose name is Edestone, has discov- 
ered how to free objects from the force of 
gravity, leaving mass and momentum un- 
affected. This is accomplished by means of a 
" deionizer," and an airship is constructed 
with six-foot steel plates and the dimensions 
of an ocean liner. Being impervious to at- 
tack, this monster can hover close to the 
earth, and rain destruction upon cities and 
fleets. Its effectiveness is such that it soon 
brings the warring powers to terms, and a 



world agreement for perpetual peace is made 
in consequence. The chief scenes are in Ber- 
lin, where the inventor " cheeks " the German 
Emperor to his heart's content, and thwarts, 
the efforts of the enraged General Staff to- 
compass his destruction and capture his air- 
ship. The science of the story is childishly 
unconvincing, and its language bears no rela- 
tion to that of real life. A most disgusting- 
injection of American slang into the closing 
chapters makes them even more intolerable 
than their predecessors. This book is dis- 
tinctly an example of how not to do the sort, 
of thing that Mr. Wells does so effectively.

NOTES ON N%W NOVELS. 

Mr. J. D. Beresford completes his trilogy con- 
taining the life history of Jacob Stahl with the- 
most satisfactory volume of the three, " The Invisi- 
ble Event" (Doran). The work has to do with a 
highly unusual situation. Continuing the narra- 
tive where it left off in "A Candidate for Truth,"' 
it opens with the expressed willingness of a clergy- 
man's daughter to live with Jacob without the- 
blessing of either church or law. Yet the young 
woman feels the injury done her conscience, until! 
the months bring Jacob slowly earned success as a 
writer, when her view of freedom becomes more- 
assured than his own. Desire for children and the- 
need for doing them justice follow on the death of 
Jacob's Avife, and the marriage ceremony takes 
place, not for conscience' sake or as a concession 
to the conventions, but solely on the children's; 
account. It is a novel of the best sort. 

Mrs. Ada Woodruff Anderson's " The Rim of 
the Desert" (Little, Brown & Co.) gains its title- 
from a plot of ground in the mountains on which' 
a spring enables irrigation to produce astonishing 
results. The hero is in the service of the United' 
States Geological Survey, and has long been on 
duty in Alaska, where he forms a noble friend- 
ship. Unable to save his friend's life, he conceives; 
what seems to be a just resentment against his- 
friend's widow; though he carries out the former's- 
wishes regarding the desert land on the widow's 
behalf. Chance throws them together without his 
being aware of her identity. An admirable love- 
story follows, with the needs of Alaska, the found- 
ing of a thriving western city, and much more in 
the background. The transfer of one's sympathies 
from the friend to the friend's widow is excel- 
lently managed. 

An atmosphere of vulgar wealth surrounds 
every character in Mrs. Elizabeth Dejeans's " The 
Life-Builders" (Harper), and none but her hero- 
and heroine, with an unmarried painter, escape 
from its insidious influences. A multi-millionaire's 
ambitions force his daughter into a preposterous 
marriage, from which she flees to seek an inde- 
pendent livelihood in New York. One wishes her- 
success were gained without her unsympathetic--

father's aid, however much the practical impossi- 
bility of this is recognized. One wishes, too, that 
the end could have been reached without a tragedy, 
though no alternative suggests itself. The book 
has merit, and is a clear statement of contempo- 
rary problems of conscience. 

The recent unfortunate taking-off of the Rev. 
Frank N. Westcott lends an added interest to his 
first book, "Hepsey Burke" (H. K. Fly Co.). 
As the work of a brother of the author of " David 
Harum," the novel invites comparison with that 
famous story ; but their only similarity lies in the 
fact that both deal with homely folk in homely 
situations, one with a shrewd but kindly man, 
the other with a charitably disposed and energetic 
widow. The latter becomes a voluntary assistant 
to a young Episcopalian clergyman and his bride, 
who take a small parish and carry on their work 
under circumstances which but for Hepsey might 
have been disheartening. The book is pleasant 
reading, often productive of hearty laughter, and 
leaves a regret that its author has not been spared 
for further work. 

After the United States has been invaded and 
almost reduced to subjection, in Mr. J. U. Giesy's 
"All for His Country" (Macaulay), a marvellous 
airship is brought into being, by which the enemy 
is routed. This airship depends for its flight upon 
what may be termed " negative gravity," a screen 
of radium shutting off the attraction toward the 
earth's surface, whereupon it rises by centrifugal 
motion. This is not only unsatisfactory as physics, 
but the same idea, minus the radium, was used in 
a magazine story not many years ago. The book 
is highly sensational, and is not likely to help us 
solve our difficulties with Japan. 

Mrs. Juliet Wilbor Tompkins's " Diantha " 
(Century Co.) is a Cinderella story, in which the 
unbeautiful twin, disciplined to give up every- 
thing to her lovely and selfish sister, is brought to 
an even greater beauty through the curative power 
of a surgical operation, so that she comes to her 
heritage lovely both in soul and body. That seems 
an ideal combination so much so that the lover 
who comes a-wooing before the transformation 
seems not quite good enough for her afterward, 
so far as the reader is concerned. 

Mr, II. II. Knibbs's hero, who lends his name 
to the story called " Sundown Slim" (Houghton), 
begins as a rather worthless and cowardly tramp 
in the cattle country, and ends as a useful member 
of society. Though the stress of the narrative is 
on the exciting events which ensue upon open 
warfare between cattle and sheep men, the devel- 
opment of the man's character is really the impor- 
tant thing. There is genuine humor in the story. 

Australian life in the upper middle class is the 
background of Mrs. Doris Egerton Jones's " Time 
o' Day" (Jacobs). The title is taken from the 
heroine's name, Thyme O'Dea, and the story is 
told by her to her great-grandchildren in posse. 
One hopes the author is mistaken in regarding her 
heroine as typical of social life on the other side 
of the globe, yet she is evidently in love with the 
girl. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The European war has brought 

A Belgian s 

prophecy of into general notice certain neg- 
mr - lected books which now appear 
in the light of subsequent events to have been 
singularly clairvoyant. The late Professor 
Cramb's eloquent lectures afford the best- 
known example. But for defmiteness of 
forecast no other work equals Dr. Charles 
Sarolea's "The Anglo-German Problem" (Put- 
nam). We have here to do not merely with 
intelligent anticipation, but with almost un- 
canny prophecy. Published in 1912 to warn 
England of the menace from Germany, the 
book fell flat and was even contemptuously 
dismissed by leading English newspapers as 
alarmist and sensational. The following sen- 
tences, scattered through the book, now seem 
more like portents than scare mongerings : 

" Europe is drifting slowly but steadily towards 
an awful catastrophe which, if it does happen, will 
throw back civilization for the coming generation." 

" It is true that in theory the neutrality of 
Belgium is guaranteed by international treaties; 
but when I observe the signs of the times, the 
ambitions of the German rulers, and when I con- 
sider such indications as the recent extension of 
strategic railways on the Belgian-German frontiers, 
I do not look forward with any feeling of se- 
curity to future contingencies in the event of a 
European war." 

"And not only is German Socialism not as 
strong, neither is it as pacifist as is generally sup- 
posed. . . Many things in Germany are national 
which elsewhere are universal. And in Germany 
Socialism is becoming national, as German po- 
litical economy is national, as German science is 
national, as German religion is national." 

" German contemporary history illustrates once 
more a general law of history, that the dread of a 
civil war is often a direct cause of a foreign war r 
and that the ruling classes are driven to seek out- 
side a diversion from internal difficulties." 

" Very few observers have pointed out one 
special reason why the personal methods of the 
Kaiser will prove in the end dangerous to peace 
namely, that they have tended to paralyze or 
destroy the methods of diplomacy." 

" In vain does the Kaiser assure us of his 
pacific intentions: a ruler cannot with impunity 
glorify for ever the wars of the past, spend most 
of the resources of his people on the prepara- 
tions for the wars of the future, encourage the 
warlike spirit, make the duel compulsory on officers 
and the Mensur honorable to students, place his 
chief trust in his Junkers, who live and move and 
have their being in the game of war, foster the 
aggressive spirit in the nation, and hold out am- 
bitions which can be fulfilled only by an appeal 
to arms." 

In view of the above passages, to which others 
of a like nature might be added, it is small 



68 



THE DIAL 



[July 15 



wonder that the book is now attracting- wide- 
spread attention. Apart from any adventi- 
tious interest, it deserves careful reading for 
its fairness, moderation, and political insight. 
Although Dr. Sarolea is a Belgian, and was 
therefore in 1912 a disinterested neutral, his 
attitude was even then one of frank sympathy 
for England, because British rule "is to-day 
the most just, the most moderate, the most 
tolerant, and the most adaptable, the most 
progressive, government of the modern world." 



Japanese an As an interpretation of "The 
interpreted by Spirit of Japanese Art," Yone 
Noguchi's little book in the ex- 
cellent "Wisdom of the East Series" (But- 
ton) would be more convincing were the 
author's command of English adequate for the 
expression of his ideas with clearness and pre- 
cision. Professor Noguchi is, however, a poet 
and a thinker ; and if, to the Occidental mind, 
his verbal imagery is sometimes obscure, no 
great effort on the part of the reader is re- 
quired to penetrate the meaning of even such 
sentences as the following: "As a certain 
critic remarked, the real beauty flies away like 
an angel whenever an intellect rushes in and 
begins to speak itself; the intellect, if it has 
anything to do, certainly likes to show itself 
up too much, with no consideration for the 
general harmony that would soon be wounded 
by it." This is the way he looks upon the 
criticism of Utamaro's works made in that 
artist's day by those who " saw the moral and 
the lesson but not the beauty and the picture." 
The ten short papers that make up the volume 
have for their themes the works of eight 
artists of the last three centuries, "Ukiyoye 
Art in Original," and "Western Art in 
Japan." Their chief claim to consideration 
lies in their presentation of the views of an 
educated Japanese of the present day who is 
impressed by the inherent worth of the classic 
art of the Far East, and yet is able to perceive 
much intrinsic merit in the work of such 
artists as Kyosai and Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. 
Such catholicity of taste savors somewhat of 
indiscriminate admiration. But Professor 
Noguchi does not write as a critic ; indeed he 
exclaims, " Criticism ? Why, that is the art 
for people imperfect in health, thin and tired." 
He aims instead to present the emotional sub- 
jectivity of which he asserts that to lose it 
" against the canvas, or, I will say here in 
Japan, the silk, is the first and last thing." 
With some of his dicta it is impossible to agree, 
as when he claims that the greatest praise we 
can give to any works of art is that "they 
never owed one thing to money or payment 
for their existence." A few misspellings of 



proper names, as " Hopper " instead of Hap- 
per, and " Fenellosa " for Fenollosa, mar the 
pages ; and in saying that Katsukawa Shun- 
sho " died in 1792 at the age of ninety-seven " 
the author overstates that artist's years by 
thirty-one. Against these slight blemishes he 
must be credited with having coined some de- 
lightfully felicitous phrases.. Of Kwaigetsudo 
Dohan he says " he might be the cleverest" of 
the Kwaigetsudo group, but " his colour- 
harmony is marred by ostentatious impru- 
dence." And in the opening sentences of the 
Introduction we have these significant words : 

"In the Ashikaga age (1335-1573) the best 
Japanese artists, like Sesshu and his disciples, for 
instance, true revolutionists in art, not mere rebels, 
whose Japanese simplicity was strengthened and 
clarified by Chinese suggestion, were in the truest 
meaning of the word Buddhist priests, who sat 
before the inextinguishable lamp of faith, and 
sought their salvation by the road of silence ; their 
studios were in the Buddhist temple, east of the 
forests and west of the hills, dark without and 
luminous within with the symbols of all beauty 
of nature and heaven. And their artistic work 
was a sort of prayer-making, to satisfy their own 
imagination, . . they drew pictures to create abso- 
lute beauty and grandeur, that made their own 
human world look almost trifling, and directly 
joined themselves with eternity." 

It is not easy to see how this could be put more 
finely or more cogently.

it does not supersede, Dr. Archibald Hender- 
son's " The Changing Drama." Dr. Lewisohn 
has paid less attention to the social, scientific, 
moral, and aesthetic causes underlying con- 
temporary drama, arid has shown us the 
change accomplished, so far as that is possi- 
ble, rather than the process. It is the drama 
as literature with which he is chiefly con- 
cerned. His first chapter, on " The Founda- 
tions," begins with Ibsen, and is a rapid 
historical and critical treatment of the Scan- 
dinavian and French movements, including 
mention of the Theatre Libre, the Freie 
Biihne, and the Independent Theatre. The 
succeeding chapters are entitled " The Realis- 
tic Drama in France," " The Naturalistic 
Drama in Germany," "The Renaissance of 
the English Drama," and " The Neo-Roman- 
tic Movement in the European Drama." At 
the end, for the convenience both of those who 
wish to make a serious study of drama and 
of those who wish merely to read profitably 
in a fascinating field, are a number of study 
lists, which group representative plays ac- 
cording to character (realism, etc.), subject

matter (social justice, sex, etc.), and struc- 
ture (unities). The book concludes with a 
valuable critical bibliography. Dr. Lewisohn 
writes from the fulness of exact knowledge 
that might be expected, has the rare faculty 
of knowing what to leave out, possesses a 
rapid and easy style, and has the poetic gift of 
communicating delicate critical apprecia- 
tions in the happy phrase. He covers the 
vast field (vast even without Italy, Spain, and 
Russia, which the reader will miss) without 
a heavy or uninteresting page. His criticism 
is exacting without being unsympathetic. If 
the reader sometimes feels that full justice 
has not been rendered the individual drama- 
tist, he will probably detect the cause in the 
fact that Dr. Lewisohn sees all drama against 
the background of Hauptmann and natural- 
ism. A certain liability to injustice must in- 
here in a book that includes such opposites as 
German naturalism and Irish neo-roman- 
ticism. Surely we may like both Hauptmann 
and Synge; but we can hardly like, as well 
as he deserves, either one in the presence of 
the other. Yet no one could ask for greater 
judicial temper in a critic than Dr. Lewisohn 
displays. Especial note should be taken of 
Dr. Lewisohn's opinion that under present 
conditions it is more important for American 
universities to train audiences than to attempt 
the production of dramatists. The student 
and general reader could do nothing more 
profitable than to use this book and Dr. Hen- 
derson's in connection with the twenty repre- 
sentative plays reprinted in Mr. Dickinson's 
"Chief Contemporary Dramatists." All of 
these books reflect the greatest credit upon 
American critical scholarship.

deeds of the silent soldier who 
at present seems to hold the destinies of 
France in his hands will insure a welcome to 
the only book he has ever written, and proba- 
bly the only one he ever will write, "My 
March to Timbuctoo'.' (Duffield), which comes 
out at this time in an English rendering by 
his compatriot, the Abbe Ernest Dimnet, who 
also contributes a most acceptable biographi- 
cal introduction of nearly fifty pages, tracing 
the development of the tardily discovered 
military genius from his boyhood in southern 
France to his appointment as generalissimo 
of the French forces and his masterly han- 
dling of the difficult situation of last August 
and September. General Joffre is now mid- 
way in his sixty-fourth year, and was already 
forty-one when, as major, he was sent to the 
Soudan to superintend the construction of the 



railway from Kayes to Baf oulabe ; and it was 
in the course of this three years' sojourn in 
Africa that he undertook the expedition de- 
scribed by him with military conciseness and 
published with the sanction of the Minister 
for Colonial Affairs. The march from Segou 
to Timbuctoo and back, with subordinate ex- 
peditions about the latter place, all for the 
purpose of establishing French influence in 
that important though almost inaccessible 
region, occupied little more than six months; 
and if the march was as rapid as some of 
Caesar's in Gaul, the account of it is even 
more terse and direct than the famous 
" Commentaries." The same unpretentious 
plainness and simplicity that charm the 
reader in Grant's soldierly chronicle are 
found here, though the French commander 
has little of fighting and nothing of complex 
military strategy to record. He had been 
asked to tell his story, and he told it with no 
waste of words. That it was worth the telling 
may be inferred if merely from the fact that 
in the two centuries preceding his expedition 
only three Europeans had visited Timbuctoo. 
M. Dimnet, who has written books in French 
and books in English, shows a perfect com- 
mand of the latter tongue. A useful map 
accompanies the narrative.

ship ; and it was as desirable as 
it was inevitable that there should be included 
at some time in the series of handbooks pub- 
lished under the auspices of the National 
Municipal League a volume devoted to the 
city manager plan. The question, however, 
may well be raised as to whether the time is 
yet ripe for the preparation of such a book. 
Certainly no one can feel that Mr. Harry A. 
Toulmin, in his volume entitled " City Man- 
ager: A New Profession" (Appleton), has 
presented more than the most tentative sort 
of discussion of the subject. The first city 
manager was employed by the city of Staun- 
ton, it is true, as many as seven years ago. 
Constitutional restrictions made it necessary 
in that instance, as in Staunton's sister city 
of Fredericksburg, to superimpose the city 
managership upon a municipal organization 
of the old mayor-council type, and it was not 
until Sumter, S. C., adopted the plan in 1912, 
and, more notably, Dayton and Springfield in 
1913, that the city managership was first em- 
ployed in conjunction with the commission 
form of city government. It is only as a fea- 
ture of the commission plan that the city 
managership has exhibited large usefulness 
or prospect of importance. This means that

[July 15 



Mr. Toulmin's data are very meagre, being 
drawn almost entirely from the experience of 
Dayton (the author's home city) and Spring- 
field during barely a twelvemonth. At that, 
one searches the book in vain for even a brief 
history of the establishment of the plan in 
these cities. Similarly, when there is under 
review the features of the important Lock- 
port Proposal of 1911, which failed in the 
New York legislature but was widely influen- 
tial throughout the country, the subject is 
dropped abruptly with no indication of the 
outcome, and is resumed only by the presenta- 
tion of a synopsis of the plan in a chapter far 
removed. To students of municipal affairs, 
few subjects are just now of larger interest 
than the city managership and its possibili- 
ties, and it will be regretted that the volume 
under review is not a better piece of work. 
But it must be reiterated that there has been 
insufficient development to warrant the pub- 
lication just now of a book upon the subject. 
A fifty-page pamphlet presenting the history 
and first results of the city managership in 
Dayton and Springfield, or in Dayton alone, 
would have met the present need. Into it 
could have been put all that is new or worth 
while in Mr. Toulmin's volume of six times 
the size.

The war has revealed a new 
France, "silent, resolute, and im- 
perturbable "; decadent France 
lias disappeared. Who has wrought the 
change? Mr. Charles Dawbarn attempts to 
answer this extremely interesting question in 
liis volume entitled " Makers of New France " 
(Pott), containing sixteen biographies, 
sketchy newspaper descriptions of fourteen 
men and two women. He has evidently seen 
or met all the persons dealt with in his book ; 
but the information contained in the various 
chapters is very meagre, and in many cases 
does not justify the inclusion of the subject 
of the chapter among the "makers of new 
France." More objectivity, more "meat," 
more definiteness, less fine writing, would 
nave made the volume more valuable. Fur- 
thermore, there is no clear evidence that Mr. 
Dawbarn had a well defined idea of what the 
"new France" is like, or that he used this 
idea as a touchstone in selecting the "makers 
of new France." Take, for example, the two 
women, Madame Paquin and Mile. Miropol- 
sky, the one a world-famous dressmaker, 
the other a lawyer of twenty-six. By no 
stretch of the imagination can this interesting 
young avocate be made responsible for the 
"new" France of which she is clearly a 
product. And what that is " new " in France 



shall we attribute to Madame Paquin, bril- 
liant and successful woman though she is? 
All Mr. Dawbarn's subjects are important 
figures in the France of to-day, some more 
so, some less; but that is nowise equivalent 
to saying that they are the makers of France. 
And what shall we say of the names that 
have been omitted? Among the "makers of 
new France," we look in vain for the name 
of an artist ; not even Rodin has found favor. 
A France without an artist is indeed a " new " 
France ! Among the writers there is no Ros- 
tand and no Rolland, only Anatole France, 
Finot, and Brieux. To be sure, Rostand is 
of the older generation; but so also is Ana- 
tole France, and Rolland must be numbered 
among the big men of the new generation. 
Mr. Dawbarn had a suspicion that we might 
"wonder why one is admitted and another 
refused," and attempted to forestall unfavor- 
able criticism by explaining that " the gallery 
is obviously limited by the covers of a book." 
What he has given us is but "the head of 
the procession moving toward the sun." Per- 
haps ; but he had no clear vision of the " new 
France," no means of infallibly discerning its 
makers, and he has failed to make clear to us 
the importance of the role of those upon whom 
his choice fell.

use or the library have come 
from authoritative sources and have met cer- 
tain needs with different readers and with 
different emphasis upon the various subdivi- 
sions of the general theme. We have had Mr. 
Gilbert 0. Ward's elementary manual on 
" The Practical Use of Books and Libraries," 
and Mr. Charles P. Chipman's "Books and 
Libraries," and Miss Gilson's " Course of 
Study for Normal School Pupils on the Use 
of a Library," not to mention the series of 
practical treatises on library matters by Mr. 
John Cotton Dana and his corps of assistants. 
Now we have, from the librarian and the 
assistant librarian in the University of Ten- 
nessee, Miss Lucy E. Fay and Miss Anne T. 
Eaton, respectively, a more generally compre- 
hensive and, one might say, popularly useful 
work than any of the above-named. It is enti- 
tled " Instruction in the Use of Books and 
Libraries" (Boston Book Co.); and though 
announcing itself " a textbook for normal 
schools and colleges," it is equally adapted to 
self-instruction, and might well have a place 
in the bookcase of every family as a compe- 
tent guide to the intelligent use of the local 
public library or to the formation of a private 
library. Divided into three parts in: one

octavo volume of 449 pages, it considers, 
first, " the use of books," then " selection of 
books and children's literature," and, finally, 
'" the administration of school libraries/' a 
more technical or professional theme than the 
general reader will care to concern himself 
with. Its book-lists and other bibliographical 
matter show care and judgment, with a 
reliance on the best authorities. Pen-and-ink 
drawings, where needed to explain the text or 
.add to its interest, are supplied by Mrs. Nor- 
man B. Morrell, and a good general index 
closes the book. The authors have done their 
work so well as to make it improbable that 
the same task will have to be undertaken again 
for a long while. 



.Strathcona as 
the evil genius 
of Canada. 



Mr. W. T. R. Preston wisely 
waited until his subject was 
dead before publishing his book 
on " Strathcona and the Making of Canada " 
(McBride, Nast & Co.). Among the least 
offensive of the comments upon Lord Strath- 
cona's life and character of which the book 
mainly consists is this: "He was as punc- 
tilious about paying off personal scores as in 
paying his debts." The same statement would 
perhaps be as charitable a way of character- 
izing Mr. Preston's attitude toward his subject 
as one would be justified in adopting. The 
book is, in fact, a fairly clever sketch of the 
life of Strathcona, particularly of his connec- 
tion with the Canadian Pacific Railway, in 
which every public scandal of the past half 
century of Canadian history is dragged out to 
serve as a background for one who is pictured 
as the evil genius of his country. Chapter 
after chapter is made up for the most part of 
.statements and insinuations, damning to 
Strathcona's memory, for which we are offered 
no better proof than Mr. Preston's word, or a 
reported conversation between Mr. Preston 
and some contemporary of Strathcona's, who 
curiously enough always happens to be dead. 
The book is decidedly one that leaves an un- 
pleasant taste in the mouth. The only point 
about this vindictive biography which is left 
in the dark is the particular grievance which 
Mr. Preston had against Lord Strathcona, 
when he set himself the task of writing the 
latter's life. 

There must be many readers 
l h hu?n e anbTing. who are utterly weary of books 

on the war. To such be it said 
that "The Human German" (Button), by 
Mr. Edward Edgeworth, has not the remotest 
connection with the struggle now convulsing 
Europe. It is a whimsical, ironical, yet sym- 
pathetic estimate of the human qualities in 



the individual German and in his collective 
achievements. Though the author is evidently 
an Englishman, he has written without na- 
tional prejudice; indeed, he has as sharp 
things to say of his own countrymen as of 
foreigners. With Berlin as his centre, he sur- 
veys the 67,000,000 Germans, their habits and 
institutions, and finds them all menschlich, 
allzumenschlich, that is to say, creatures of 
human frailty, but for that reason of human 
interest and likableness. Even in the porten- 
tous and forbidding German State, a human 
nucleus is discovered. This genial tolerance 
is plentifully spiced with a sense of humor 
and a perception of the ridiculousness of most 
of the ways and works of men. The author is 
a capital raconteur, and some of his stories 
(for example, that of the disconcerting experi- 
ment of the eugenics professor) are memora- 
ble. Happily, however, his book is not for the 
most part anecdotal, but is pitched in a more 
impersonal key. Though ideas are not fon- 
dled for their own sake, the human material 
is everywhere discussed in a vein of philoso- 
phic banter. The result is highly amusing, if 
not always formally instructive. When the 
reader has finished, he has perhaps not learned 
many new facts about Germany, but he has 
certainly come to know the Germans better; 
and more surely still he has made the acquain- 
tance of Mr. Edgeworth, whose idiosyncrasies 
of mind and temperament make up a person- 
ality well worth cultivating. Altogether this 
is a very human book by a very human writer 
about a people who are by no means as inhu- 
man as their methods of warfare indicate. 



The development in pre-revolu- 
tias l s-ma~ier. tionary times in Eastern Penn- 
sylvania of a notable industry in 
the manufacture of glassware of considerable 
artistic merit both in form and color is related 
in Mr. Frederick W. Hunter's "Stiegel Glass" 
(Houghton) . The work is the result of the au- 
thor's enthusiastic efforts as connoisseur and 
collector in gathering the Hunter collection 
of colonial glassware now in the Metropolitan 
Museum of New York. It recounts his diffi- 
culties and successes in ferreting out the his- 
tory of Baron Stiegel, his family connections, 
his land, iron, and glass ventures, his colonial 
and foreign trade, his efforts (by means of 
the American Flint Glass Lottery) to recoup 
his losses due to over-zealous expansion and to 
the approach of the War of Independence. 
There is much information about the methods 
of manufacture employed, verified by excava- 
tions on the sites of Stiegel's three factories, 
and comparisons of these findings with extant 
specimens of the handicraft of these colonial

artisans. The work is illustrated by twelve 
plates in color, and 159 fine half-tones por- 
traying the range in shapes and decorations. 
Diaries and account books have been ran- 
sacked to determine the dates of the enter- 
prises, and to develop an interesting picture 
of the efforts of this enthusiastic but vision- 
ary manufacturer to extend the sale of his 
wares in competition with those from Euro- 
pean makers. Brief accounts of other colonial 
ventures in glass-making are also given. The 
work is well written, and is full of interest as 
a picture of industrial conditions in colonial 
times, as well as of colonial art and handicraft. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. E. Belfort Bax, the author of several works 
on Socialism, has written a volume entitled " Ger- 
man Culture, Past and Present" (McBride, Nast 
& Co.), which describes the mediaeval civilization 
of Germany during the Reformation period. As a 
socialist, the author believes in the economic inter- 
pretation, rather than the " great man " theory. 
Consequently, there is less mention of Luther than 
of the peasants' revolts, the Anabaptist movement, 
the collapse of knighthood, and such like general 
tendencies. The two concluding chapters, dealing 
with that modern German culture which is based 
on militarism and national efficiency, seem an 
afterthought suggested by the war. 

Five titles constitute the beginning of a new 
series to be known as " The Nation's Library," each 
volume being written especially for the series by a 
well-known authority. They are as follows: 
" Eugenics," by Dr. Edgar Schuster ; " Modern 
Views on Education," by Dr. Thiselton Mark; 
" The Principles of Evolution," by Mr. Joseph 
McCabe; "The Star World," by Professor A. C. 
de la Crommelin ; and " Socialism and Syndical- 
ism," by Mr. Philip Snowden. In each instance, 
both in these volumes and in those in prospect, the 
aim is to view the specialized information on the 
subject in its relationship to modern life and 
thought. (Baltimore: Warwick & York, Inc.) 

Mr. Arnold Wynne's " The Growth of English 
Drama" (Oxford Press) is a simply and ad- 
mirably planned book. After four chapters on 
" Early Church Drama on the Continent," " En- 
glish Miracle Plays," " Moralities and Interludes," 
and " Rise of Comedy and Tragedy," the writer 
treats comedy and tragedy separately down to 
and including Nash and Marlowe, and concludes 
the work with an appendix on the Elizabethan 
Stage. The feature which gives Mr. Wynne's 
book individuality, insures it against the charge 
of repetition of familiar matter, and makes its 
writing a real service to literature, is his generous 
use of well-selected passages in illustration of 
characteristic plays. There is enough of this in 
the volume to make it a study of literature as well 
as a study about literature. The special student 
will find the book a convenience, while for the 
general reader it will supply a real need. 



NOTES. 



"The Landloper" is the title of Mr. Holman 
Day's new novel, which Messrs. Harper will issue 
this month. 

Mr. George Kennan, whose " Tent Life in 
Siberia " originally appeared forty-five years ago, 
has a volume of Russian stories and sketches in 
the press, to be published during the summer 
under the title of "A Russian Comedy of Errors." 

Of especial interest in " The English Review " 
for June is the first instalment of Maxim Gorki's 
vividly written autobiography. As with nearly all 
other English periodicals at this time, the contents 
of this issue are devoted almost wholly to contribu- 
tions having to do with the great war. 

A series of about one hundred letters, many of 
them never before published, written by Washing- 
ton Irving to Henry Brevoort between the years 
1807 and 1843, will appear in the autumn with the 
imprint of Messrs. Putnam. The volume is edited 
by Mr. George S. Hellman, who also contributes 
an Introduction. 

" Why Europe is at War " is the title of a vol- 
ume soon to come from Messrs. Putnam. It is 
made up of essays by writers from each of the 
belligerent Powers, giving reasons why their re- 
spective countries are at war, together with a con- 
cluding chapter expressing the point of view of 
the United States. 

Goncharov's " Oblomov," in which the author 
created a type which has taken its place in Rus- 
sian literature as firmly as that taken by Pecksniff 
in English literature and Tartuffe in the literature 
of France, has been translated from the Russian 
by C. J. Hogarth for an English edition which is 
now in preparation. 

Arrangements have been completed by Mr. Lau- 
rence J. Gomme for publishing " The Anthology 
of Magazine Verse for 1915," compiled, as usual, 
by Mr. William Stanley Braithwaite. Mr. Gomme 
has found it necessary to issue a new edition of the 
anthology for 1914, which he now has ready. He 
has also published Mr. Clinton Scollard's " The 
Vale of Shadows, and Other Poems of the Great 
War." 

A new volume in the " Countries and Peoples 
Series " is in preparation by Messrs. Scribner and 
will be published before long. It is entitled 
" Scandinavia of the Scandinavians " and is writ- 
ten by Mr. Henry Goddard Leach of New York, 
Secretary of the American Scandinavian Founda- 
tion, who has lived several years in Scandinavia. 
It will describe the daily life and the habits of 
thought of the three northern nations, Denmark, 
Norway, and Sweden. 

Sir Henry Newbolt has written a book for boys 
on the European War, entitled " The Book of 
the Thin Red Line," which is announced for early 
issue by Messrs. Longmans. From the same house 
will come Mr. Maurice S. Evans's " Black and 
White in the Southern States," a study of the 
race problem in the United States from a South 
African point of view ; and a revised and enlarged 
edition of Dr. Charles Gross's " The Sources and 
Literature of English History."

Two books on the Renaissance may shortly be 
expected. One of these is Mr. Christopher Hare's 
illustrated " Life and Letters in the Italian 
Renaissance," in which the author contrasts the 
lives of writers and thinkers from Lorenzo the 
Magnificent to Machiavelli and Baldassare Castig- 
lione with the pomp and splendor of their time; 
the other is a " History of the Renaissance : The 
Protestant Revolution and the Catholic Reforma- 
tion in Continental Europe," by Professor Edward 
M. Hulme, of the University of Idaho. 

Due to the war, the " Statesman's Year Book " 
for 1915, which Messrs. Macmillan will soon issue, 
has been subjected to a large amount of revision. 
Egypt has been transferred to the British Empire, 
the Turkish pages have been largely rewritten, and 
all the countries included have been brought as 
far as possible up to date. A diary and bibliog- 
raphy of the war are included, together with a 
list of important publications on the struggle, 
arranged according to the countries of origin. 

Among the books to be issued in the autumn by 
the Yale University Press are: "The Port of 
Boston," by Professor Edwin J. Clapp ; " Jour- 
neys to Bagdad," by Mr. Charles S. Brooks; 
" Symbolic Poems of William Blake," by Pro- 
fessor Frederick Erastus Pierce ; " The Liberty 
of Citizenship," by the Hon. Samuel W. McCall; 
" The New Infinite and the Old Theology," by 
Professor Cassius J. Keyser; "A Voice from the 
Crowd," by Mr. George Wharton Pepper; aud 
" Henry Fielding's Covent-Garden Journal," 
edited, with an introduction and notes, by Pro- 
fessor Gerard E. Jensen. 

The autobiography of Richard Whiteing, whose 
'' Number 5 John Street " is still remembered and 
read nearly a score of years after its first publica- 
tion, is among the forthcoming publications of 
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. Mr. Whiteing's inti- 
mate association for the last half century with all 
that was best in art and literature, and with much 
of what was most interesting in social progress 
both in England and on the Continent, and his 
skill with the pen ought to make his recollections 
an interesting volume. Before its appearance in 
book form a series of chapters from the work will 
be published in " The Bookman," beginning with 
the July number. 

Publishing in England, except for the war- 
books, is almost at a standstill, says " The New 
Statesman." " In the autumn and spring a con- 
siderable number of books were published; but 
these had been almost all arranged for, and most 
of the expenditure upon them contracted, before 
the war. But the publishers are now drawing in 
their horns. Few new books are coming out, and 
authors are finding it difficult to get commissions 
or place manuscripts. Some even of the largest 
firms are postponing publication of important 
books, commissioned long since, until after the 
war. New enterprise now is altogether too specu- 
lative for most people." 

The first volume of the English translation of 
Treitschke's " History of Germany in the Nine- 
teenth Century " will be published at once in this 
country by Messrs. McBride, Nast & Co., with an 



Introduction by Mr. W. Harbutt Dawson on " The 
Extinction of the Empire." It carries the narra- 
tive from " Germany after the Peace of West- 
phalia " to the end of " The War of Liberation." 
Volume II., dealing with " The Beginnings of the 
Germanic Federation, 1814-1819," will follow in 
September, and the remaining five volumes at 
quarterly intervals. Mr. Dawson will write the 
supplementary volume, dealing with the history of 
Germany from the point at which it was left by 
Treitschke down to date. 

Lovers of the writings of John Muir will be 
glad to know that he left at his death a large body 
of important manuscript material which Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Co., his authorized publishers, 
will issue in the near future. Arrangements are 
pending for the publication of several character- 
istic records of travel similar to Mr. Muir's well- 
known books on the Sierras and the Yosemite, as 
well as for a notable " Life, Letters, and Journals " 
which promises to take its place with the most 
important American publications of this type. 
This will be the only biography of Mr. Muir 
authorized by the family, and all persons who 
have letters or other material likely to be of value 
to the biographer will confer a favor by sending 
such material to the publishers for forwarding. 

The Concordance Society issues, in " Circular 
No. 9," a brief report of progress and prospects. 
Though no publishing has been done since the 
appearance of the Wordsworth concordance four 
years ago, there are in preparation two similar 
works, a concordance to Coleridge, and one to 
Browning, only one of which will the Society be 
able to assist in a pecuniary way. All members 
are invited to indicate their preference. A Keats 
concordance, finished by its compilers more than 
a year ago, has recently been accepted for publica- 
tion by the Carnegie Institution. Other like under- 
takings enjoying assistance from the same quarter 
and soon to be completed, in book-form, are Pro- 
fessor Lane Cooper's " Concordance to Horace " 
and a " Concordance to Spenser." A concordance 
to Goethe's poems is also projected. Stronger 
support and increased membership are asked for 
by the Society. 

Mr. Sidney Low has edited a series of essays on 
" The Spirit of the Allied Nations," contributed 
by various writers, each of whom is an authority 
on his subject. " The Spirit of France " is dealt 
with by Paul Studer, Taylorian Professor of the 
Romance Languages in the University of Oxford; 
" The Spirit of Russia," by Alexis Aladin, late a 
member of the Russian Duma ; " The Spirit of 
Belgium," by Paul Hamelius, Professor of English 
Literature in the University of Liege ; " The Spirit 
of the Serb," by Dr. R. W. Seton- Watson, author 
of "The Southern Slav Question"; "The Spirit 
of Japan," by J. H. Longford, Professor of Japa- 
nese at King's College, University of London ; and 
" The Spirit of the British Empire and its Allies," 
by the editor. Mr. Low also summarizes the con- 
clusions of the various writers in an introductory 
essay, and adds some personal notes of a recent 
visit to the French battle zone. The volume is 
announced for immediate publication.

THE FINE FLOWER OF AMERICAN 
THOUGHT. 



The five young men of William and Mary 
College who foregathered on the fifth of De- 
cember, 1776, to organize the first Greek letter 
society in America, builded better than they 
knew. "A happy spirit and resolution of 
attaining the important ends of society enter- 
ing their minds," they chose as their emblem 
a square medal with S. P. engraved on the one 
side, and Phi Beta Kappa on the other, " for 
the better establishment and sanctitude of 
their unanimity." Within a year, the society 
had grown to a membership of fourteen, and 
had provided itself with officers, laws, and an 
oath of fidelity. Such were the modest begin- 
nings of the organization which has since 
flourished apace, which now includes chapters 
in eighty-six American institutions of collegi- 
ate and university rank, with a living mem- 
bership of more than thirty thousand men 
and women, and which for over a century has 
set admission to its ranks as a shining goal 
upon which every college student of serious 
purpose has centred his ambition. The par- 
ent idea of the society found so many imita- 
tors that the combinations and permutations 
of the Greek alphabet have been heavily 
drawn upon to supply the mystic designa- 
tions needed, and in too many cases the idea 
has been perverted to serve purposes that are 
anything but academic, to stand for snobbish 
exclusiveness or a brummagem college aris- 
tocracy; but the Phi Beta Kappa has re- 
mained the society of scholarship in the 
severest sense, and its badge has continued to 
denote intellectual distinction and nothing 
else. 

The progress of the war caused the society 
to languish in Virginia, and it was in danger 
of an early death, when steps were taken for 
its extension into New England, and the 
establishment of chapters at Harvard, Yale, 
and Dartmouth made its future secure. It 
was the North, and later the West, that gave 
it enduring vitality, and it is a noteworthy 
fact that only a dozen of the chapters existing 
to-day are south of Mason and Dixon's line. 
When the society gave up its attributes of 



84 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



secrecy, owing to the anti-masonic agitation 
of 1826, and abandoned the tomfoolery of 
oaths and cipher codes, it still further empha- 
sized its unique position among academic 
organizations, and opened its path to a future 
growth that would hardly have been possible 
under the old conditions. The Harvard chap- 
ter seems to have been mainly responsible for 
what has been for more than a century the 
chief manifestation of Phi Beta Kappa activ- 
ity the annual celebration by an oration 
(and sometimes a poem) in which each branch 
of the society pays tribute to the ideals of the 
founders. The early records of Harvard men- 
tion an oration in 1788 by John Quincy 
Adams, then a graduate of twenty; and a 
poem in 1797, by Robert Treat Paine. Lafay- 
ette in 1824, after listening to an oration 
nearly two hours long by Edward Everett, 
offered the following toast: "This Antient 
University, this Literary Society. This Holy 
Alliance of Learning and Virtue and Patri- 
otism is more than a match for any coalition 
against the rights of mankind." The Har- 
vard roll alone of orators and poets is almost 
a catalogue of the chief mountain peaks in 
the range of American literature, including 
as it does the names of three Adamses, Tick- 
nor, Emerson, Beecher, Curtis, Phillips, 
Woodrow Wilson, Bryant, Holmes, Longfel- 
low, and Gilder. For the foregoing facts, 
together with much other interesting histori- 
cal material, we are indebted to an article in 
"The Sewanee Review," by Professor John 
M. McBryde, Jr., the editor of that quarterly. 
How the history of Phi Beta Kappa 
throughout the nation has justified Lafay- 
ette's toast is triumphantly shown in the 
volume of "Representative Phi Beta Kappa 
Orations" recently published under the edi- 
torship of Professor Clark S. Northup. It is 
the aim of every chapter, for the occasion of 
its annual meeting, to obtain for its orator the 
most eminent man within its reach, and the 
honor of the invitation is such that it is 
rarely declined. The speaker feels that some- 
thing better than his normal best is demanded 
by the occasion, and strives to emulate the 
great men who have preceded him in the 
function. The consequence is that Phi Beta 
Kappa oratory has now for a century em- 
bodied the best thought and the finest powers 
of expression of the intellectual leaders of the 
nation, and offers a wealth of material which 



American literature treasures as one of its 
most valuable assets. This is the reason for 
which we have ventured to characterize the 
volume now before us as the unfolding of 
" the fine flower of American thought." Here 
we have, in a commentary ranging over the 
greater part of a century, the voice of Amer- 
ican idealism in its purest strain, the voice 
which expresses what the nation is funda- 
mentally thinking upon religion, literature, 
science, politics, education, and the conduct 
of life, in short, upon all the great subjects 
of human concern. Only an anthology of the 
noblest American poetry could be equally 
indicative, in a typical way, of the essential 
genius of the nation. 

The papers here reprinted are twenty-six 
in number, 1837 and 1910 being, respectively, 
the earliest and the latest dates. The former 
year is that of Emerson's stirring Harvard 
address upon " The American Scholar," our 
intellectual declaration of independence, 
which fired the youth of that early generation 
with the exalted purpose to realize the mission 
of democracy in the wider spheres of thought 
and action. The latest date is that of Pro- 
fessor Paul Shorey's Oberlin address upon 
" The Unity of the Human Spirit/' with its 
calm assurance of refuge for the mind in the 
fortress which guards the permanent achieve- 
ments of the human intellect from all the 
winds of doctrine that buffet its impregnable 
defences. And between these two dates, how 
imposing an array of our greatest thinkers is 
marshalled, and how wide a range of subjects 
of the first importance is considered! Let a 
few only of the speakers and their themes be 
instanced to show what manner of writing is 
here to be found. Besides the two already 
mentioned, we have Andrew Preston Peabody 
on " The Connection between Science and 
Religion," George William Curtis on "The 
American Doctrine of Liberty," Francis 
Andrew March on " The Scholar of To-day," 
Charles Kendall Adams on " The Relations of 
Higher Education to National Prosperity," 
Wendell Phillips on " The Scholar in a Repub- 
lic," Andrew Dickson White on "Evolution 
vs. Revolution in Politics," Charles William 
Eliot on "Academic Freedom," and Woodrow 
Wilson on "The Spirit of Learning." Here 
are ten names that stand for our intellectual 
best, the names of men to whom we can point 
with confidence that no ill-considered teach- 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



85 



ing and no unworthy thought will proceed 
from their lips. And many of the other 
names are of hardly less weight. If those of 
Job Durfee and Charles Henry Bell are not 
exactly household words, those of John Jay 
Chapman, Bliss Perry, John Franklin Jame- 
son, Josiah Royce, and Barrett Wendell rep- 
resent men who are held in high esteem as 
broad-minded and penetrating analysts of our 
social and intellectual life. 

It is only natural that some of the earlier 
utterances among these orations should show 
unmistakable signs of " dating." It seems 
curious to find Horace Bushnell speaking of 
" the new science of political economy" ; and 
there is an echo from a remote past of igno- 
rance and prejudice in Andrew P. Peabody's 
remark that " if people choose to admire Vol- 
taire and worship Goethe, none can gainsay 
them." We are far indeed from the time 
when the Frenchman might be dismissed as a 
mere scoffer at things sacred, or the German 
as an immoral devotee of the cult of self- 
realization. Even Emerson's great plea for 
the scholar's individuality and independence 
seems now a little antiquated. Peabody's sug- 
gestion that the " Natural Orders have not in 
a scientific aspect superseded the Linnsean 
system " sounds quaint to a modern botanist. 
When Curtis tells us that " the foundation of 
liberty in natural right was no boast of pas- 
sionate rhetoric from the mouths of the fath- 
ers," he gives expression to a doctrine that is 
unfashionable among the young lions of our 
new political theorizing, although we suspect 
that he was nearer the truth than they are. 
And a later critic of literature than F. A. 
March would hardly make contemptuous ref- 
erence to "the long-drawn eunuch dallyings 
of Swinburne or Whitman," whatever in 
March's imagination these may have been. 
But the substance of even the oldest of these 
addresses is of the essence of wisdom, because 
the speakers, true to the ideals of the society, 
have concerned themselves with the eternal 
rather than the temporal, and have planted 
their feet upon the solid foundations of truth. 

It is not surprising that Emerson's classical 
essay on " The American Scholar " should 
have fixed a type for Phi Beta Kappa orations 
to which many of his successors have sought to 
conform. The society stands for scholarship, 
and the exaltation of the scholarly function. 
Thus, in the present collection, we find " The 



Scholar of To-day," "The Scholar in a Re- 
public," and " The Attitude of the Scholar." 
Closely related to this theme are, of course, 
such matters as " Intellectual Leadership in 
American History," " Humanities Gone and 
to Come," "Academic Freedom," " The Spirit 
of Learning," "The Mystery of Education," 
and "The Unity of the Human Spirit." These 
are all lights shed upon the function of the 
scholar in society. The second Leitmotiv of 
the collection is democracy, as instanced by 
such titles as " The American Doctrine of 
Liberty," " Evolution vs. Revolution in Poli- 
tics," " Jefferson's Doctrines under New 
Tests," " The Hope of Democracy," and 
"Democracy and a Prophetic Idealism." 
Science, religion, and social welfare also con- 
tribute their themes to the counterpoint of 
this symphony of idealism. If we are to 
seek for a text which shall stand for the 
collective meaning of the volume in its essen- 
tial attributes, and, indeed, for the underly- 
ing thought of all Phi Beta Kappa oratory 
which is true to type, it will be in Professor 
Shorey's address on "The Unity of the Human 
Spirit," which is perhaps the best piece of 
writing, compact of pregnant wisdom, among 
all these modern instances. The writer's 
thesis is "the identity of the highest Euro- 
pean thought of the past two or three thou- 
sand years," which is practically all the 
thought that counts for civilization, and his 
protest is against the notion that there is 
much that is either new or important in the 
speculative vagaries of our noisy contempora- 
ries. One of his most valuable suggestions is 
that our distracted minds would be well- 
advised to go back to Mill, from whom they 
may learn " lessons of comprehensive and con- 
secutive thinking, judicial weighing of all 
considerations pro and con, temperance and 
precision of expression, and scrupulous fair- 
ness to opponents, which they will hardly get 
from the undigested mixtures of biology, 
nervous anatomy, anthropology and folk- 
lore, answers to questionnaires, statistics, and 
reports from the pedagogical or psychological 
seminar, with a seasoning of uncritical his- 
torical and illiterate literary illustration, that 
compose the made-to-order text-books of 
pedagogy, sociology, ethics, and psychology 
on which their minds are fed." We know of 
no finer or more persuasive call to the spirit 
of humanism than is found in the following :

" There is one great society alone on earth, the 
noble living and the noble dead. That society is 
and will always be an aristocracy. But the door

to the ignorance and prejudice that fixes our hyp- 
notized vision on the passing phantasmagoria. A 
certain type of educator is given to denouncing the 
tyranny of the classics. There is no intellectual 
tyranny comparable to that exercised over the 
imagination by the present, the up-to-date, with its 
incessant panorama of self-representation, its 
myriad-voiced iteration of itself from the news- 
papers, the dime magazines, the platforms that 
mould or enforce the opinions of ninety million 
men. The new psychologists have coined a ques- 
tion-begging epithet into a pseudo-scientific term, 
' misoneism,' or hatred of novelty, to stigmatize the 
hesitation of culture to accept every popgun of 
hypothesis as the crack of doom. What Greek 
compound will do justice to that hatred of the old, 
that distaste for everything not mentioned in yes- 
terday's newspaper, which seals their minds, and 
the minds of the generation which they are edu- 
cating, to so much of the inherited beauty and 
wisdom of the world? . . But if, to wrest the old 
Platonic phrases once more to our purpose, the 
flux is not all, if the good, the true, and the beau- 
tiful are something real and ascertainable, if these 
eternal ideals reembody themselves from age to 
age essentially the same in the imaginative visions 
of supreme genius and in the persistent sanity and 
rationality of the world's best books, then our 
reading and study are redeemed, both from the 
obsessions of the hour, and the tyranny of quanti- 
tative measures and mechanical methods. The 
boundless ocean of books is before us, and the 
courageous reader will make many a bold voyage 
of discovery to rarely visited shores. But more 
and more as the years go by will he concentrate his 
attention on the books that preserve from age to 
age the precious distillation of the human spirit in 
its finest flower. They are not so many but that 
he may in time hope to seek them out and in some 
sort to know them. They are comparatively few, 
but

Doth ever live and move and work and strive.' "

"THE NATION'S" JUBILEE. 

The passing of the half -century mark in the 
life of "The Nation" is an event well worth 
the attention which it has received. With a 
circulation small in comparison with that of 
the popular magazines, an expense to its 
owners much of the time rather than a source 
of profit, it has nevertheless been the most 
powerful and the most healthful single influ- 
ence, in American periodical literature during 
the period which its life has covered. To have 
read its pages means to have been brought 



into serious contact with every important field 
of human thought and action, and sooner or 
later with all the most important workers in 
those fields. A prominent New Yorker once 
remarked, whether justly or not does not mat- 
ter here, that he read a certain paper when- 
ever he wanted absolute intellectual rest. No 
such remark could ever plausibly be uttered 
concerning " The Nation." To provoke vital 
thought on vital questions was the aim of its 
sponsors from' the outset, and that aim has 
been abundantly realized. And for such a 
purpose the profession of journalism has pro- 
duced no more effective pen that that of 
E. L. Godkin, its first editor. His intellect 
and energy and character were so inextricably 
woven into its columns during the first dec- 
ades of its existence that one might easily 
make the mistake of thinking of it as his per- 
sonal organ, a mistake, because Godkin's 
work for " The Nation " was always wholly 
above personal motive. 

But Godkin unaided could not have made 
" The Nation " what it was. The excellent 
editorial management of Wendell Phillips 
Garrison, associated .with Godkin from the 
beginning, gave just the setting which the 
latter's writing needed. It was Garrison who 
chose the numerous staff of reviewers who 
lent weight and dignity and continuity to 
" The Nation's " literary columns, and hun- 
dreds of letters are in the hands of these 
reviewers to-day bearing testimony to the con- 
scientiousness with which his duties as literary 
editor were performed and to his kindly per- 
sonal interest in his widely scattered staff. 
With Godkin and Garrison in control, it is no 
wonder that " The Nation " drew to its stand- 
ard a large percentage of the most capable 
leaders of thought and action in the land. 
And through its influence on the leaders, it 
has reached and benefitted multitudes who do 
not even know of its existence. 

The strength of " The Nation " has been 
that of sincere devotion to high ends, and 
intelligent management in the pursuit of 
those ends. This is abundantly brought out 
in the contributions which fill its Jubilee 
issue. It is pleasant to know that the pas- 
sage of its fifty-year mark finds " The Nation " 
in a position of renewed energy and pros- 
perity, its owners and editors thoroughly 
devoted to the standards which Godkin and 
Garrison created for it, and its circulation on 
the ascending pathway. The efficiency of 
democracy lies in the willingness of indi- 
viduals to do just such work as Garrison and 
Godkin inaugurated, and to inspire others in 
succession to take hold of that work and 
maintain it as a permanent institution.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

A SPUR TO LITERARY EFFORT IN THE SOUTH, 

where the people seem tolerably content to 
live their lives without romancing about them 
in print, has for fifteen years been sedulously 
applied by the State Literary and Historical 
Association of North Carolina, which now, un- 
der the zealous leadership of Professor Archi- 
bald Henderson, shows the world what it is 
doing in the " Proceedings " of its fifteenth an- 
nual session, a notable document that tends to 
disprove the truth of those famous lines of the 
bard of South Carolina : "Alas for the South ! 
Her books have grown fewer ; She never was 
much given to literature." That the Old North 
State has become or is becoming addicted to 
literature in a creditable measure, is the im- 
pression gained from reading the papers 
(included in these "Proceedings") on North 
Carolina historians, novelists, ballad litera- 
ture, poetry, and oratory, North Carolina 
bibliography for the year, North Carolina's 
famous "0. Henry," and her late poet lau- 
reate, Henry Jerome Stockard. A tablet, with 
medallion portrait, in memory of William 
Sidney Porter (" 0. Henry") was unveiled in 
the Hall of History, at Raleigh, where the 
meetings of the Association were held; the 
Patterson Memorial Cup for literary achieve- 
ment was presented to Dr. J. G. de R. Hamil- 
ton, whose recent book, "Reconstruction in 
North Carolina," brought him this honor; an 
address on " Some Argentine Ideas " was 
delivered by Ambassador Naon ; and from 
first to last President Henderson was active in 
promoting the success of the entire series of 
exercises, his opening paper on "The New 
North State " sounding an unmistakable note 
of high-hearted hopefulness and determina- 
tion. Prominence was given, in the addresses 
and discussions, to the need of historical study 
and writing throughout the state, with a view 
to the production of worthy histories of the 
counties of North Carolina, only a few of 
which have yet been made the subject of such 
study. Outside of Virginia, it would be diffi- 
cult to point to more creditable endeavor of 
this literary-historical sort, in any of our 
southern states, than that which has for more 
than a decade been led and inspired by 
Professor Henderson. 



REMINISCENT OF THOREAU and his sturdy 
though ineffectual protest against what he 
considered an unjustifiable tax levy, was the 
prompt refusal, the other day, of Thoreau's 
most distinguished living fellow- townsman to 
pay a fine of ten dollars for failing to make 



the drainage system of his Concord house 
tributary to that of the town. For more than 
a year considerable publicity has attended 
Mr. Sanborn's resolute defence of his case 
before the authorities and in the courts of 
law ; and the end is not yet. " I shall die 
before this case is settled," was the defen- 
dant's prophecy as he appealed the question 
to a higher court on the ground of unconsti- 
tutionally in the existing law. There must 
be many still living who can recall that char- 
acteristic manifestation of recalcitrancy which 
brought the hermit of Walden into close 
acquaintance with the town lock-up. It was 
his refusal on one occasion to pay his yearly 
tax that procured him this inside knowledge, 
and of course it was on high moral grounds 
that he took his stand in the matter, with 
what one suspects to have been a real enjoy- 
ment of his brief martyrdom in the supposed 
cause of justice. As the story goes, when 
Emerson, upon hearing of his friend's incar- 
ceration, hastened to the house of detention 
and, appearing at the door of Thoreau's cell, 
sorrowfully demanded of him, "Henry, why 
do I find you here ? " the other promptly re- 
joined, in a like tone of voice, "Waldo, why 
do I not find you here?" The spectacle of 
Thoreau in the common jail may well have 
appeared too incongruous to admit of long 
continuance ; at any rate, some one, probably 
Emerson himself, effected an early adjust- 
ment of the difficulty with the tax-collector, 
and the prisoner, considerably against his 
will, found himself at liberty. It is impossible 
to believe that this later instance of opposition 
to the constituted authorities of Concord in- 
volves any disregard, on the opponent's part, 
of the best interests of the community; and 
his picturesque appearance in court as able 
and fluent counsel in his own defence must 
breed a rather general desire for the success 

of his cause. 



THE TRAGIC END OF ARTHUR SEDGWICK, wllO 

took his own life on the fourteenth of July in 
a moment of despondency caused by ill health 
and other anxieties, has evoked some interest- 
ing reminiscences of the man's noteworthy 
achievements in more than one branch of 
activity, and his repeated exhibition of the 
best qualities of mind and heart. Arthur 
George Sedgwick was born October 6, 1844, in 
New York, was graduated from Harvard in 
1864, entered the volunteer army of the 
North in the same year, as lieutenant of the 
Twentieth Massachusetts Regiment, fell into 
the hands of the Confederate forces at Deep 
Bottom, Virginia, soon afterward, and became 
acquainted with the interior of Libby Prison, 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



where he contracted an illness that disabled 
him for further service in the field. At the 
close of the war he studied law and practised 
in Boston until 1872 ; edited, with Mr. Oliver 
Wendell Holmes, Jr., "The American Law 
Review," and about 1875 was admitted to the 
New York bar. He practised his profession 
in New York until 1881, but the inclination 
to literary pursuits seems to have drawn him 
more and more from the dry technicalities of 
the law. He joined the editorial staff of 
" The Nation " and " The Evening Post," and 
contributed to other journals as well. A 
course of Lowell Institute lectures on law was 
delivered by him in 1885-6, and he was Godkin 
Lecturer at Harvard in 1909. With Mr. F. S. 
Wait he produced a work on land titles, also 
wrote "Elements of Damages," edited the 
fifth edition of his father's " Measure of Dam- 
ages," assisted in editing the eighth edition of 
the same treatise, and was one of the authors 
of " Essays on the Nineteenth Century." But 
what he gave to the world as a writer cannot 
be taken as an adequate measure of his abil- 
ity in letters. His personality stood for far 
more than his writings. Original and uncon- 
ventional in his habit of mind, he appears, 
especially in view of his sad end, as one some- 
what too keenly conscious of the ironies of 
life, too acutely appreciative of the cruel joke 
played upon man at the moment of his birth. 



NOVELTIES IN LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION, some 
of them merely experimental and short-lived, 
and others having the qualities of perma- 
nence, come from time to time to the attention 
of him who is interested in the never-ceasing 
evolution of "the people's university" if 
one may be allowed still to use the hackneyed 
and often ridiculed but nevertheless servicea- 
ble and appropriate Carlylism. One of the 
latest of these innovations is described by 
Dr. Bostwick in his current annual report of 
the St. Louis Public Library. It is the instal- 
lation of a public writing room, for corre- 
spondence and similar purposes, first in a 
small upper room designed for study, and 
then, as the new department gained in popu- 
larity, in larger quarters originally designed 
for the storage of pamphlets, but affording 
unused space enough for four writing tables 
accommodating twenty-four persons. Pens, 
ink, and inexpensive stationery are supplied 
without charge, while a better quality of paper 
and envelopes, as well as postage stamps and 
illustrated library postcards, may be pur- 
chased at cost. Furthermore, the attendant 
in charge "takes dictation, does typewriting 
and notarial work, and receives orders for 



translations from foreign languages, at cur- 
rent rates." Thus the department is made 
self-supporting, and the public convenience 
is served. It is true that many libraries have 
long made a practice of furnishing, in a more 
or less irregular and haphazard fashion, 
similar accommodation on request; but an 
organized and equipped secretarial depart- 
ment is something of recent origin. A word 
of praise must not be omitted for the rather 
unusual art features of Dr. Bostwick's report, 
all contributed by the St. Louis School of 
Fine Arts (connected with Washington Uni- 
versity) and comprising a colored frontis- 
piece and numerous sketches and designs in 
black-and-white. Nor are there lacking still 
other features of notable interest in this 
record of a year's library work. 

* 

STEVENSON AT SARANAC sought, not very 
successfully, physical reinvigoration, and won, 
with less of premeditated design, a considera- 
ble fraction of his present renown as a writer. 
It was here that in the winter of 1887-8 he 
produced most of those admirable essays that 
made their first appearance in print in 
" Scribner's Magazine " during the ensuing 
year, and that include such favorites as " The 
Lantern-Bearers," "A Christmas Sermon," 
" Pulvis et Umbra," " Beggars," " Gentlemen," 
and "A Chapter on Dreams." Here too he 
conceived the plot and structure of his novel, 
" The Master of Ballantrae " ; and what else 
of ferment and germination took place in his 
mind as he walked about the secluded ham- 
let on the lake, who shall attempt to say? 
Memorable enough, at any rate, is the fact of 
his sojourn in that retired nook of the Adiron- 
dacks to warrant the erection there of some 
statue, urn, tablet, bust, or other worthy 
memento in his name; and therefore the 
Saranac Lake Stevenson Memorial Committee 
has been formed to accomplish this end. The 
noted sculptor, Mr. Gutzon Borglum, has 
enthusiastically entered into the plan, and 
will design the proposed memorial as a labor 
of love, it is announced. Popular subscription 
is invited for meeting the necessary expenses 
of the undertaking, and contributions may be 
sent to Dr. Lawrason Brown, chairman of the 
committee, at Saranac Lake, New York. 


THE DEATH OF A DICTIONARY-MAKER WOuld 

ordinarily attract little attention even in the 
world of letters ; for dictionary-makers are, as 
a class, as obscure as their work is useful. In 
the death of Sir James A. H. Murray, however, 
at Oxford, July 27, the learned labors of a 
distinguished philologist at the head of the 



1915] 



THE DIAL

most important lexicographical work ever un- 
dertaken in our language are brought to a 
premature close. It had been his hope to 
finish before he reached the age of eighty the 
great "New English Dictionary/' commonly 
known as the Oxford Dictionary, on which he 
had been engaged since 1888; but with the 
final volume still in preparation he died at 
his post two years before the time set for the 
writing of " Finis " after the last entry under 
the letter Z. Dr. Murray, as he was known to 
the world until he became a knight in 1908, 
was born in 1837 at the little town of Den- 
holm, Roxburghshire; received his academic 
training at London University and afterward 
at Balliol College, Oxford; and subsequently 
was the recipient of honorary degrees in gen- 
erous number and variety from various seats 
of learning. His published writings have been 
almost wholly of a philological character, and 
are chiefly scattered through the publications 
of learned societies devoted to his chosen 
branches of research. But his great work is, 
of course, the dictionary so ably planned and 
edited by him with the help of thirty assistant 
editors for the sorting of the mountains of 
material submitted by more than fifteen hun- 
dred co-workers engaged in the vast amount of 
reading required in such an enterprise. Dr. 
Johnson, with his six amanuenses, would in a 
whole lifetime have made but little headway 
on so vast a work. Happily, the successful 
termination of Murray's magnum opus is as- 
sured by the zeal and ability of his editorial 
staff and the stability and resources of the 
Oxford University Press. 


HAROLD SKIMPOLE ONCE MORE comes to our 
attention in a hitherto unpublished letter 
which Mr. Clement K. Shorter tells us, in 
" The Sphere," he recently had the good for- 
tune to acquire, and which he prints for the 
benefit of his readers. Charles Dickens is the 
writer, and Leigh Hunt his correspondent, the 
date of the missive being June 23, 1859, seven 
years after the perpetration of the notorious 
caricature to which the first paragraph of the 
brief letter so lightly refers. That paragraph 
is as follows: "Believe me, I have not for- 
gotten that matter; nor will I forget it. To 
alter the book itself, or to make any reference 
in the preface of the book itself, would be to 
revive a forgotten absurdity, and to establish 
the very association that is to be denied and 
discarded." And yet the world will never 
deny or discard the association; and how 
Dickens himself felt about it at an earlier 
date, when the ink was scarcely dry on the pen 
that drew the distorted portrait, appears un- 



mistakably in a private letter reproduced by 
Mr. Shorter. Unremorsefully, self-compla- 
cently even, Dickens writes to Mrs. Richard 
Watson of Rockingham Castle : " Skimpole 
I must not forget Skimpole of whom I will 
proceed to speak as if I had only read him 
and not written him. I suppose he is the 
most exact portrait that was ever painted in 
words ! I have very seldom, if ever, done such 
a thing. But the likeness is astonishing. I 
don't think it could possibly be more like 
himself. It is so awfully true that I make a 
bargain with myself ' never to do so any more.' 
There is not an atom of exaggeration or sup- 
pression. It is an absolute reproduction of a 
real man. Of course, I have been careful to 
keep the outward figure away from the fact; 
but in all else it is the life itself." Here evi- 
dently was an instance where the writer should 
have prayed to be protected from his own 
excess of cleverness. Significant, in this con- 
nection, is the invariably cordial and admir- 
ing mention of " my friend Charles Dickens " 
which occurs in Leigh Hunt's autobiography. 


THE DANA CENTENNIAL, the hundredth re- 
currence of the day (August 1) on which was 
born the author of "Two Years before the 
Mast," has passed with some appreciative 
mention, here and there, of the early devel- 
oped talent of the young man who at nineteen, 
for his health's sake, shipped as a common 
sailor for the voyage round the Horn, and at 
twenty-five published, in what has proved one 
of the best and most popular books of its kind, 
a detailed account of this seafaring experience. 
It is his one and sufficient claim to literary 
immortality; for neither his later volume, 
"The Seamen's Friend," nor his edition of 
Wheaton's " International Law," nor anything 
else from his pen, is ever mentioned in the 
same breath with his early masterpiece, which 
was in very truth "a voice from the fore- 
castle," presenting "the life of a common 
sailor at sea as it really is -the light and the 
dark together." This booky which has been 
reprinted no one knows how many times, and 
which only two or three years ago reappeared 
in two simultaneous and rather elaborate edi- 
tions, was sold to its first publishers for $250, 
but brought considerably more to its author 
from its conscientious English re-publisher. 
Indeed, its success in England among persons 
of note in literature was most 'gratifying. 
Formal celebration of Dana's centennial will 
be held, somewhat belatedly, under the aus- 
pices of the Historical Society of his native 
town, Cambridge, on the 27th of October,

A NATIONAL HOME FOR THE PUBLISHING AND 
BOOKSELLING ARTS AND CRAFTS WOUld meet a 

need that must have been at least vaguely felt 
for a long time by those engaged in the manu- 
facture and sale of our large and increasing 
annual product of reading matter of the more 
respectable sorts. Such a permanent home, 
like that so successfully maintained in Leipzig 
by the German book-trade, seems bound to 
come in the not distant future; and its com- 
ing has been hastened, it is to be hoped, by the 
recent able plea for its establishment in 
"The Publishers' Weekly," from the pen of 
Mr. B. W. Huebsch, who would have in the 
proposed building headquarters for the 
Authors' League, the Booksellers' League, the 
Publishers' Co-operative Bureau, the Amer- 
ican Booksellers' Association, and other simi- 
lar organizations. Here, too, the recently 
started Booksellers' School would have its 
abode, and here would be maintained a 
bureau of information for all interested in 
books and their production, with a competent 
superintendent at its head. As Mr. Huebsch 
explains his plan, " the building would be an 
exchange; all of the agencies engaged in the 
production and distribution of books, pic- 
tures, and music would co-operate, preserving 
their present identity and autonomy, but act- 
ing as a whole when a temporary union 
seemed desirable." Further practical details 
are added, so that the whole scheme is made 
to appear entirely feasible as well as highly 
desirable; and the home itself, delightful in 
anticipatory contemplation, is to be architec- 
turally worthy of its high purpose. 



THE VIGOR OF RUSTIC SPEECH, such speech as 
those may hear who spend their summer vaca- 
tion in the far backwoods and among the 
mountains, lies largely in the clinging to old 
forms and idioms that date back perhaps to 
rugged sixteenth-century days, or even earlier, 
and have survived the wear and tear of the 
intervening centuries only by virtue of an 
exceptional geographical remoteness from the 
centres of progress and the abodes of unrest. 
It is in such rural retreats that one still hears 
the good, mouth-filling possessive pronouns, 
liisn and Kern, yourn and ourn and theirn, as 
logically formed as thine and mine, though no 
longer countenanced in polite society or in 
literature. There, too, a healthy preference 
for strong preterites lingers, and is responsi- 
ble for the diction of the small boy who tells 



how he " clum " up a tree, or " whup " his 
schoolmate, or " fotch " the doctor to minister 
to grandpa's " rheumatiz." In the current 
" Harper's Monthly " is published an interest- 
ing account of linguistic and other usages 
in " Shakespeare's America," by Mr. William 
Aspenwall Bradley. By " Shakespeare's Amer- 
ica" is meant the secluded region of the 
Cumberland Mountains where speech and cus- 
tom have suffered little modification from the 
changing fashions of the world at large. 
There, for example, present participles enjoy 
all the rights and privileges of adjectives, 
including the ability to express degrees of 
comparison by adding the regular endings. 
Mrs. Jones may be the "talkingest" woman 
in town, or Lucy Lindsay the " smilingest " 
girl ever seen. One Cumberland Mountain 
matron was being complimented on her skill 
in knitting as she followed the rough country 
roads or climbed the steep trails. " Oh. that's 
nothin' !" she exclaimed, deprecatingly. '' Now 
ther's Aunt Mandy. She's the knittingest 
woman ever I saw. She takes her yarn to bed 
with her ever' night, and ever' now and then 
she throws out a sock." 



JAPAN'S ANNUAL BOOK-TRADE is increasing, 
as a writer in " The Japan Times " notes with 
satisfaction, though he is pained to observe 
the subordinate place it still holds in com- 
merce when compared w r ith the traffic in alco- 
holic beverages of various sorts; and he casts 
an eye of envy upon the much larger sale of 
reading matter that this country can boast 
larger per capita as well as in the total. Books 
of all sorts, except school textbooks, have a 
yearly sale in Japan amounting to about three 
million yen, or half as many dollars; maga- 
zines show an equal circulation; elementary 
schoolbooks are in demand to the extent of two 
million three hundred thousand yen ; and 
textbooks for the intermediate schools call for 
an annual outlay of about half as much. 
What the high schools and colleges have to say 
in regard to textbook-purchase is not recorded 
by the " Times." This yearly disbursement of 
almost ten million yen for literature is credita- 
ble, though we must remember that Japan's 
population is fifty-six millions, so that an 
average of only fifteen sen is spent annually 
on reading matter by the Japanese man, 
woman, or child. Seven cents a year will not 
buy much of a library. 



LEXICOGRAPHY IN WAR AND PEACE continues 
sedately to pursue its appointed course. In-

briskly in the making than during such times 
as these, as every newspaper reader has abun- 
dant cause to know. And so we cease to 
wonder that the makers of the great Oxford 
Dictionary allow themselves no vacation on 
account of current conditions in Europe, and 
we read without surprise in the Paris 
"Figaro" that "the French Academy de- 
voted yesterday's session to its work on the 
French Dictionary" a work that has gone 
on, with little interruption, for nearly three 
centuries, while empires rose and fell and 
dynasties succeeded one another, and will con- 
tinue to go on as long as there shall be a 
French nation and a French language. Ger- 
man armies may come and go, may surge to 
the gates of Paris and roll back again; but 
the French Dictionary goes on forever. 

THE INDUCTION OF CHILDREN INTO BOOKLAND 

calls for tact and skill, and often for inex- 
haustible patience and an abundant store of 
kindliness. It was fourteen years ago that 
the art and science of this branch of modern 
librarianship received full recognition in the 
establishment of a training school for chil- 
dren's librarians at the Carnegie Library of 
Pittsburgh, this school being the outgrowth 
of a training class formed the year before for 
the preparation of young women to serve in 
the juvenile department of that library. It 
is supported by an endowment fund given by 
Mr. Andrew Carnegie, and in its plan and 
purpose it has had many imitators on a smaller 
scale, chiefly in the form of training classes 
connected with public libraries or library 
schools. The Pittsburgh school enjoys the 
advantage of an immediate environment em- 
bracing juvenile representatives of almost 
every European nationality, and there are 
eight branch libraries as well as the central 
library for the active prosecution of this kind 
of work among the children of the city. Thus 
is furnished a vast laboratory for purposes of 
practice, and it is not surprising to learn that 
the school attracts pupils from far beyond the 
borders of its own community. A full account 
of its w r ork is given in the " Circular of Infor- 
mation " which it issues in this its fifteenth 
year. . . 

THE UNIVERSITY OF TSINGTAU has only a 
prospective existence at present, but if the 
plans of prominent Japanese educators, aided 
by certain men of wealth in both Japan and 
China, and with the support of leading schol- 
ars in the two countries, are carried out, we 
shall ere long see the tenets of Confucianism 
taught where not long before the principles of 
Teutonic militarism were undergoing demon- 



stration. It is urged by the promoters of this 
laudable enterprise that as Shantung is the 
native province of the great Chinese philoso- 
pher, it is eminently fitting that it should have 
a university devoted to the study of Confu- 
cianism and of the Chinese classics in general. 
Count Okuma is said to favor the plan, and 
such a noted scholar as Dr. Unokichi Hattori, 
who is to lecture at Harvard next term, is also 
interested. Among other signs of a sort of re- 
vival of learning in this part of the far East, 
there is remarked a quickening of interest 
in current philosophic thought. Sir Rabin- 
dranath Tagore, the Hindu poet and philoso- 
pher who has already won many disciples and 
admirers in Europe and America, is expected 
to visit Japan in October and expound the 
principles of his philosophy. In fact, an im- 
pulse that might be called a Tagore movement 
is now said to be manifest in Japan. Such 
signs of intellectual activity are more than 
welcome in days like these. 



BOOK-COLLECTING WHILE YOU WAIT is prom- 
ised on the most reasonable terms and with the 
utmost promptness by a certain western firm 
which wishes it to be known that " every book 
in any language, new or old, published either 
in this country or abroad, may be obtained 
through us at a moderate price" a joyful 
bit of news, surely, for all collectors not in 
the multimillionaire class. Furthermore: 
"We know no such word as fail! Nearly 
every man of intelligence wants some book 
which he cannot find. We make it our busi- 
ness to hunt up such books and get you any 
book printed anywhere at any time. The 
longer you have looked for the same without 
success, the better it will suit us, as you will 
be all the more pleased with our services. We 
have filled thousands of orders for books 
which could not have been supplied by ordi- 
nary booksellers. Sometimes it may take 
months to trace a book which is ' out of print/ 
but we emphatically wish to state to the book- 
buying public that it would be a waste of time 
to ask if we can furnish a certain book. Send 
your money (or if price is unknown, $1.00 to 
$2.00 on account) and the book will be for- 
warded to your address, or if not in stock, 
ordered for you, otherwise the amount paid 
will be returned." What a chance to secure, 
" at a moderate price," John Eliot's Indian 
Bible, for example, or a first folio Shakespeare !

THE DIAL

Cambridge, is ere long to become a memorial 
" for the benefit of the public," as was lately 
learned through the filing of the will of the 
recently deceased Mrs. Richard Henry Dana 
(Edith Longfellow Dana), daughter of the 
poet. Another daughter, Miss Alice Longfel- 
low, at present occupies the house ; but as soon 
as there shall cease to be any Longfellow heir 
desirous of making such domiciliary use of the 
historic mansion, it is to be dedicated to the 
free use of the public as a Longfellow museum, 
or Longfellow memorial, with suitable pro- 
vision for its maintenance. Thus this praise- 
worthy intention will be realized before many 
years, and what is one of the most interest- 
ing eighteenth-century houses in America will 
open its doors without restraint to visitors.

BEYANT AND " THE NEW POETKY." 
(To the Editor o THE DIAL.) 

What constitutes the perishable and what the 
imperishable element or elements in poetry ? 
The question is perennial. It has been asked and 
answered innumerable times, but still it confronts 
the poetry lover; who, howsoever much light he 
may seek or find upon the subject, is always, in the 
end, obliged to answer it anew for himself. That 
is, if he be truly a poetry lover. If his love for it 
is mere lip-service, it is quite otherwise, for then 
the anthologists and the appreciators are at his 
elbow to settle the matter for him without further 
ado. 

. Nowadays, it must be allowed, there is a multi- 
tude of counsellors, and those disinclined to think 
or to feel, to weigh or to ponder, are blessed with 
an infinitude of opportunities for having such 
things done for them, the results of these opera- 
tions being dealt out on demand, by the yard or by 
the pound, and served over the counter as is any 
other merchandisable commodity. Some of them, 
too, are very attractively done up ; and while the 
contents of the carton may not invariably be all 
that the label incites the purchaser to suppose, it 
is an old story that predigested pabulum is not 
intended for hearty appetites. Moreover, expecta- 
tion and fulfilment never have been and never will 
be any more necessarily synonymous in a literary 
than in any other sense. 

Some such thoughts as these came unsummoned 
to my mind one evening not long ago when it was 
my privilege to hear the " what's what " of poetry 
expounded by no less an authority than Miss Har- 
riet Monroe. She was addressing a large assem- 
blage of presumed poetry-lovers, and was speaking 
upon a variety of verse in which, presumably, their 
interest, like her own, was intense namely, 
" The New Poetry." Her expression of opinion 
was, therefore, devoid of dissembling or weak con- 
cession. Perhaps, though, the term " expression 
of opinion " is inadequate as applied to her re- 
marks, for they were rather a statement of doe- 



trine, a promulgation of law, than a mere outline 
of idea or theory. Miss Monroe stated, without 
hesitation, that the " new poetry movement " in 
America was the most important thing in the 
literary world to*-day; and that this so-momentous 
" movement " had originated in the sanctum of her 
magazinelet, " Poetry." I gathered that, something 
as Dr. Franklin, upon a celebrated occasion, sent 
up a kite and brought down the lightning among 
an astounded populace, Miss Monroe sent up 
" Poetry " and brought down " the new poetry." 
Apparently, also; her experiment was fully as elec- 
trical as that of the Doctor. For later in the eve- 
ning, when one of the stars in the " new poetry's " 
firmament, Mr. Carl Sandberg, delivered two origi- 
nal poems, entitled, respectively, " Bobby Burns " 
and " Billy Sunday," the thrills which his recita- 
tion or, to speak more correctly, reading pro- 
duced far exceeded many that I have seen evoked 
by the application of the galvanic battery. 

Miss Monroe was also kind enough to throw 
some explicit and, so-to-speak, ex-officio illumina- 
tion upon the newness which is the distinguishing 
trait of " the new poetry." Incidentally, of course, 
she found it expedient to animadvert upon the old- 
ness of other poetry. In doing so again of 
course it was necessary to exhibit a Horrible 
Example, and the one that she selected was William 
Cullen Bryant. 

I cannot pretend to recall more than the drift, 
the purport, of Miss Monroe's references to 
Bryant, but among other things that she said 
were these: That she had spent a considerable 
portion of that very day in re-reading Bryant, 
and, with his best work thus fresh in mind, she 
felt compelled to state that, of his entire copious 
poetical output, there were only two pieces which 
" would live." These pieces, she said, were 
" Thanatopsis " and " To a Water-fowl." But she 
qualified this fiat by adding that the " Water- 
fowl " was " doubtful," as in certain respects it 
was " very faulty." But, at any rate, these were 
the only two poems of Bryant's, she declared, that, 
under any circumstances, she would think of ac- 
cepting for publication in " Poetry," were they 
contemporaneously composed and offered to her 
for that purpose. 

It was quite like the " Off-with-his-head-so- 
much-for-Buckingham " line that Colley Gibber, 
they say, wrote into " Richard III.," and more 
than a few of Miss Monroe's hearers turned to 
each other with subdued oh's and ah's. But they 
felt conscious that, while perhaps participating 
in something almost sacrilegious, from the poetical 
point of view, they had been "in at the death," 
just the same; also that, in the language of the 
street, they were being " put wise to the real 
thing." And many fair hands were clapped in 
applause by ladies present of whom, I have an 
idea, more than a few, in times it would be impo- 
lite to say how long past, had recited from the 
rostrum " The Death of the Flowers " as typical 
of what they then considered most beautiful and 
most moving in American verse. 

Bryant, then, is poetically " a dead one." Miss 
Monroe bas said so, and Miss Monroe knows. She 



1915] 



THE DIAL

spoke in behalf of Time, and with an accent that 
betrayed her intimate familiarity with that hoary 
functionary. But the only trouble was that she 
did not go far enough. For instance, I at least 
would have felt grateful if she had singled out 
those poems, let us say, of Mr. Sandberg's, which 
" would live." Or, for that matter, any others 
which have appeared in " Poetry " to date. I have 
read it pretty regularly, and my uncertainty re- 
garding such items is so utter that a little enlight- 
enment from Miss Monroe would have been to me 
as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
While, just as Baudelaire invented decadence, 
Mallarme symbolism, Poe the grotesque and ara- 
besque, and Hugo romanticism, " the new poetry " 
was invented in the sanctum of " Poetry," as Miss 
Monroe unequivocally declared, she did at least by 
inference assert that the patron saint of the 
" movement " was Walt Whitman, that if any 
one " great influence " was the springboard from 
which its practitioners took their flying leap into 
the poetical empyrean, it was that of Walt. This 
being so, it occurred to me to turn to what Walt 
had said of Bryant for I remembered, although 
I could not recall its precise phrasing, that it was 
not at all like what Miss Monroe had said. I find 
it to be as follows (see " Specimen Days ": " My 
Tribute to Four Poets ") : 

" In a late magazine one of my reviewers, who ought 
to know better, speaks of my ' attitude of contempt 
and scorn and intolerance ' toward leading poets of 
my ' deriding ' them, and preaching their ' uselessness.' 
If anybody cares to know what I think and have 
long thought and avow'd about them, I am entirely 
willing to propound. . . . Bryant pulsing the first 
interior verse-throbs of a mighty world bard of the 
river and wood, ever conveying a taste of open air, 
with scents as from hayfields, grapes, birch-borders 
always lurkingly fond of threnodies beginning and 
ending his long career with chants of death, with here 
and there through all, poems or passages of poems, 
touching the highest universal truths, enthusiasms, 
duties morals as grim and eternal; if not as stormy 
and fateful, as anything in ^Eschylus." 

Such was Whitman's tribute to Bryant. It does 
not strikingly resemble that of the editress of 
" Poetry " ; but, somehow, it seems to come nearer 
" touching the highest universal truths, enthusi- 
asms, duties " of poetry. 

To me, I must also confess, the selection of 
Bryant as a Horrible Example by propagandists of 
the " new poetry " is singularly ill-judged. For is 
it not both illogical and unjust that an exponent of 
rers libre and allied affairs should " knock " a poet 
who, generations before most " new poets " were 
born, himself wrote : 

" No smooth array of phrase, 

Artfully sought and ordered though it be, 
Which the cold rhymer lays 

Upon his page with languid industry. 
Can wake the listless pulse to livelier speed, 
Or fill with sudden tears the eyes that read. 

" The secret wouldst thou know 

To touch the heart or fire the blood at will? 
Let thine own eyes o'erflow ; 

Let thy lips quiver with the passionate thrill; 
Seize the great thought, ere yet its pewer be past, 
And bind, in words, the fleet emotion fast. 



" Then, should thy verse appear 

Halting and harsh, and all unaptly wrought, 
Touch the crude line with fear, 

Save in the moment of impassioned thought; 
Then summon back the original glow, and mend 
The strain with rapture that with fire was penned." 

Still, I think Miss Monroe was entirely correct 
when she declared the unfitness of Bryant's poetry 
for her publication. As Walt says, it " ever con- 
veys a taste of the open air " and if there is 
anything that the verse printed in " Poetry " does 
not convey, it is precisely that quality. " The new 
poetry " is, manifestly, manufactured in sanctums, 
as was the " movement " that it features. Hence, 
the thought of anything of Bryant's in the pages 
of " Poetry " is indeed impossible. And, by the 
way, what, oh, what, do you suppose Walt would 
have thought of Miss Monroe's magazine if he had 
lived to see it? J OHN L. HERVEY.

EESULTS OF THE WISCONSIN SURVEY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The words "once more" in the title given by you 
to Dean Comstock's letter in your issue of July 15, 
" The Wisconsin Survey Once More," recall how 
quickly even students tire of controversy over 
things that can be settled. 

It is on this fact that the University counted 
from the first. For a time it wavered between the 
policy adopted by the normal schools, that is, ad- 
mitting the truth and proceeding to correct defects, 
and the other policy of standing pat, denying 
everything, and diverting attention from defects of 
the University to personalities of surveyors. 

When a dean of a graduate school of a university 
with international reputation makes a statement, 
readers of THE DIAL naturally expect that this 
statement is truthful as well as scholarly. Dean 
Comstock writes that the State Board of Public 
Affairs failed to adopt the report of survey investi- 
gators, wrote a report of different tenor, and sub- 
stantially repudiated the Survey findings. Casual 
examination will show that the conclusion is con- 
trary to fact. The State Board agreed with the 
Survey in all but three of the matters touched upon 
by both the Survey and the State Board. It dis- 
agreed on trifling matters only: (1) substitution 
of state pensions for Carnegie pensions; (2) sub- 
stitution of Madison-owned for University-owned 
high school; (3) substitution of optional for com- 
pulsory military drill. In other matters the State 
Board supported the Survey, inter alia: 

1. Research is unsupervised and needs to be 
supervised, p. 12. 

2. Social sciences have not grown with the Uni- 
versity, p. 14. 

3. More practical field work is needed, p. 14. 

4. Supervision of instructors is inadequate and 
needs to include class-room visiting, p. 16. 

5. Student adviser system not as effective as it 
might be and needs strengthening, p. 17. 

6. Junior colleges are needed and are practical. 
p. 28. 

7. University should discontinue high school in- 
spection for purposes of accrediting and should 



94 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



continue it for the sole purpose (the board said) of 
improving the quality of instruction in the subjects 
each community decides to place in its high school. 
p. 31. 

8. Regular courses leading to graduation and 
degrees without foreign language requirements 
should be established, p. 32. 

9. Students have too little contact with the older 
and stronger men on the faculty, p. 32. 

10. Further attention to organization and admin- 
istration of Wisconsin high school is needed, p. 33. 

11. Only such small classes should be continued 
as are fully justified upon investigation, p. 34. 

12. Better organization and more systematic 
management of the Extension Division are needed 
and the instructional force should be strengthened. 
p. 36. 

13. The University has failed to follow rigidly 
the legislative requirements in giving preference 
when allotting dormitory accommodations to stu- 
dents in this state, p. 62. 

14. A high percentage of non-use of certain class- 
rooms is shown, p. 62. 

15. Accounting system is not in accordance with 
modern business methods, pp. 124, 126. 

16. Some few members of the faculty have taken 
unwarranted advantage of the opportunity offered 
them for outside work, and their service to the 
University has been impaired through a division 
of their interest, p. 15. 

Do these statements from the State Board's 
report look like wholesale endorsement of the Uni- 
versity's efficiency and like repudiation of fact 
reports showing in what particular places ineffi- 
ciency exists? 

A similar discrepancy between fact and Dean 
Comstock's report will be found at whatever point 
the reader cares to follow up Dean Comstock's 
statement. The thesis which he says I wrongly 
referred to as plagiarized covers a ground that was 
incomparably better covered in a thesis submitted 
to the University of Paris in 1876. One chapter of 
it is taken almost verbatim from an English work, 
with the scant acknowledgment that the chapter is 
based upon that work. The fact that eastern schol- 
ars found the work satisfactory means absolutely 
nothing until the readers of THE DIAL know 
whether those scholars had seen the works upon 
which it was based and had critically read the 
thesis itself. If the Columbia professors who 
liked the thesis read it with no greater care than 
the Wisconsin professor who approved it their 
liking is meaningless. If they approved it after 
reading Piggeoneau's thesis of 1876 and Colvin's 
Godfrey, so much the worse for Columbia scholar- 
ship. If they approved it without reading these 
works, again so much the worse for Columbia 
scholarship. 

The fact is that there is not one of these eight 
theses which a Harvard professor would be willing 
to send to Paris, Berlin, or Oxford as a fair sample 
of American scholarship. 

The history of the thesis now admitted to be 
technically plagiarized is more sordid than any 
experience I had in ten years' dealings with Tam- 
many Hall. Dean Comstock first wrote a blanket 



denial: the thesis was admirable, absolutely origi- 
nal in a field entirely lacking in secondary sources. 
When these statements were proved to be untrue, 
he secondly wrote in the Survey report that only a 
small part of the thesis was plagiarized. Now he 
writes to THE DIAL that considerable portions were 
given without proper reference. The fact is, and 
he knows it and the president knows it and the two 
regents who compared this work with original 
sources know it, that the thesis was from cover to 
cover paste and scissors work taken from other 
sources with a brazenness that would cause the 
University to drop a freshman. 

Is there not some reader of THE DIAL who is 
interested enough in the nation-wide aspects of this 
situation to make a personal inspection of this 
thesis and of the Galland thesis above referred to 
and of the other six theses? If so, I will pay his 
board in Madison and all travelling expenses if he 
does not report that the Survey understated rather 
than overstated the scholarship deficiencies of these 
theses, provided that Dean Comstock will pay for 
board and travelling expenses if such student 
reports that we overstated these deficiencies. 

Madison, Wis., July 30, 1915. W ' H ' ALLEN - 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The communication printed above, of which I 
have seen an advance proof, furnishes an excellent 
illustration of certain methods characteristic of the 
Allen Survey. The incautious reader who is 
tempted to infer an official approval of the Allen 
report from the sixteen to three comparison above 
made should turn to pp. 909-926 of the report cited. 
He will there find set forth, in all the pomp of 
serial numbers, 339 separate recommendations 
made by Mr. Allen to the State Board of Public 
Affairs. If we assume nineteen of these to be 
accounted for by Mr. Allen's foregoing exposition 
of the case, shall we infer that the remaining 320 
constitute the material to which reference is made 
in the Findings of the Board of Public Affairs, 
under the heading, " Conclusion " p. 36 of the 
official volume? This reference is as follows: 
"Absence from this report of specific recommenda- 
tions relative to any matter commented upon by 
any investigator employed by this board is not to 
be construed as an endorsement of his views. In 
several particulars the Board of Public Affairs 
does not accept either the conclusions or findings of 
one or the other of the investigators employed by 
it; but either because of want of full information 
or for other satisfactory reasons this board with- 
holds specific recommendations." 

One must admire the optimism with which the 
surveyor contemplates the waste-basket to which 
ninety-five per cent of his recommendations are 
consigned, and which regards the following finding 
of the State Board as confirmation of his charges : 
" That the administration of the institution has 
been of a superior order is evidenced by the posi- 
tion the University of Wisconsin holds."

THE WISCONSIN THESES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Let me express my appreciation of the spirit of 
fairness you exhibit in printing simultaneously in 
your columns two such diverse views of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin Survey as Dean G. C. Corn- 
stock, of the Graduate School of the University of 
Wisconsin, and Margaret A. Friend, of Milwaukee, 
present in your issue of July 15. 

I personally was one of the number who reported 
on doctors' theses accepted and approved of by 
the University of Wisconsin. I was amazed at the 
triteness, the mediocrity, the superficiality, and the 
dishonesty of the work. The author of one of these 
theses dealt with' the history of a great family dur- 
ing the time of the Crusades, as treated in a cycle 
of poems produced in the Middle Ages. The fol- 
lowing are some of the things that appeared in the 
course of my work : 

I. The author's thesis served no purpose in the 
world of scholarship; it was merely the duplica- 
tion of the work of a Trench scholar, who in 1876 
presented a thesis on the same subject before the 
University of Paris. The French scholar's han- 
dling of the subject was infinitely more compre- 
hensive and incomparably more brilliant than that 
of the Wisconsin man. 

II. The Wisconsin man incorporated bodily 
into his thesis a section of an introduction to a 
prose work in English. This extract forms an in- 
tegral part of his thesis, constituting a whole 
chapter. It consisted of an historical sketch of the 
main character treated in his thesis. Dozens of 
accounts of the hero's life were available, but this 
account happened to be of just the right length to 
serve as a chapter in his thesis. 

III. The whole of the thesis of 120 pages if 
we leave out the 20 blank pages that are numbered 
is merely a technical exercise to prove the author 
a linguistic virtuoso in three old Romance lan- 
guages : Old French, Old Spanish, and Old Italian. 
Seven of the nine texts used by the author were 
in Old French, only one text in Old Spanish and 
that in prose the thesis purported to be a 
" Poetic History," and the other one in Old Ital- 
ian, of which a half dozen good translations exist. 
The two latter texts are treated only cursorily by 
the author. 

IV. Not a statement occurs in the last chapter 
of the thesis, termed " Conclusion," that cannot be 
found in the thesis of the French author written in 
1876. Many statements are translated verbatim 
without giving the French scholar credit. The 
style of the thesis does not yield a trace of bril- 
liancy; and the observations, the conclusions, and 
in fact the whole, of the thesis fails to show a single 
gleam of originality. And this is the type of work 
that the great University of Wisconsin accepts as 
an original contribution, and rewards the perpe- 
trator with the highest possible reward of scholar- 
ship, the degree of Doctor of Philosophy ! 

Every statement made here can be readily sub- 
stantiated by detailed and concrete proof. When 
the borrowed and unaccredited sections were read 
aloud to two of the regents, Dean Comstock and 



the head of the department concerned, the regents 
were convinced of the validity of the criticisms. 
Later, in the final Survey report, I was surprised 
to discover that the " lifted " chapter above re- 
ferred to is called an " annex " to the thesis by the 
University! As late as July 1, 1915, not a sign 
existed to show that the author regarded it as such.

MR. ALLEN AND THE WISCONSIN FACULTY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of July 15 is a letter signed Mar- 
garet A. Friend, defending Mr. W. H. Allen's Sur- 
vey of the University of Wisconsin. Its essential 
point is the following : " The University . . 
wanted a report . . as a few in authority wished it 
to be seen. It got a report as the six hundred 
faculty members saw it." 

Though Mr. Allen's methods, purposes, stand- 
ards, and findings, as investigator, educator, and 
efficiency expert, have been extensively canvassed 
in the intellectual press of America notably in 
the New York " Evening Post," " The Nation," and 
THE DIAL, "the six hundred faculty members" 
have heretofore expressed their opinion only in 
private. Thus your correspondent's statement may 
well suggest to some readers a new and important 
aspect of the subject; administrative tyranny, 
whether of president, deans, or board of trustees, 
over an oppressed and voiceless faculty has often 
been alleged and sometimes proved in the uni- 
versity world of America. Is Mr. Allen, then, fight- 
ing for such " six hundred faculty members " at 
Madison? No, and absolutely no. 

But it has become Mr. Allen's policy to attempt 
to enlist, or to pretend to have enlisted, the faculty 
against the administration. A cardboard folder, 
dated May 28, 1915, and signed by Mr. Allen, enti- 
tled " Open Letter to Faculty Members of the 
University of Wisconsin," begins thus : " In your 
name a new glossary of vituperation is being cre- 
ated; 'academic freedom' at the University of 
Wisconsin is being so defined as to prohibit free 
and impersonal consideration of opportunities for 
increasing efficiency," etc. The whole lengthy docu- 
ment is a masterpiece of folly, and was so ad- 
judged, I fancy, by every one of " the six hundred " 
who took time from better things to peruse it. 

All " the six hundred " filled out the elaborate 
questionnaires on which a part of Mr. Allen's 
report was subsequently based, only to find their 
evidence in many cases misunderstood or curiously 
manipulated. Later, a large number of those " six 
hundred " directly cooperated, by written memo- 
randa or by oral conference, in furnishing the 
materials from which was made up that scholarly, 
keen-witted, and high-minded rejoinder, the appen- 
dix entitled " Comment by Committee of, University 
Faculty upon Report of Investigators." Note, in- 
deed, the significant words, " Committee of Uni- 
versity Faculty " not Miss Friend's " few in 
authority." 

Moreover, the present writer, through many 
months of pretty wide contact and conversation, 
has not heard from a single colleague one word of 



96 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



defence or even of apology for Mr. Allen's work. 
Whatever useful details of criticism may be found 
here and there in its voluminous pages, as a whole 
Mr. Allen's report, while certainly an attack upon 
" the few in authority," is still more certainly an 
attack upon the entire faculty. But it is chiefly an 
attack upon university ideals and the yet broader 
principles of candor, justice, and intelligence. 

The above statement has been read to a repre- 
sentative group of university colleagues ; they unite 
in the hope that THE DIAL may give it the fullest 
publicity. w. E. LEONARD. 

University of Wisconsin, July 22, 1915. 



[It is not practicable, nor do we feel that it 
would be profitable, to allow this discussion to 
continue further in our columns, and the corre- 
spondence must therefore close with the publi- 
cation of the letters printed above. EDITOR.] 



AN IMAGIST TO THE DEFENCE. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
My attention has been drawn to an article in 
your issue of June 24, entitled " Recent Poetry." 
The author of this review takes exception to the 
preface of my book of verse, " Irradiations." As 
he has taken the trouble, in a series of dogmatic 
statements, to deny about everything I wrote in 
that preface, surely it is only fair to me to permit 
me to undogmatically defend myself. Let the pub- 
lic be the judge between us. 

First of all, Mr. Alden assumes that in my 
preface to " Irradiations " I was speaking of the 
theories of the Imagists as a group. Surely he 
should have known that I was doing nothing of the 
sort. The preface to " Some Imagist Poets " 
contains all that the Imagists desire to hazard 
concerning themselves collectively. The preface to 
" Irradiations " is purely a personal utterance. 

Mr. Alden next says that the art of poetry in 
English-speaking countries is not in a greatly back- 
ward state. That is a question of Mr. Alden's 
taste or rather, of the scope of his reading, 
about which he tells us nothing. 

" Poets have not attempted to make of their craft 
a Masonic secret, declaring that rhythm is not to be 
analyzed." Apparently, then, many English poets 
have written technical treatises on rhythm! Yet I 
know of only three who have tackled this subject: 
Poe, Lanier, and Robert Bridges. If Mr. Alden 
knows of more, he should enlighten my ignorance. 
" It is not true that each line of a poem repre- 
sents a single breath." Then what does it repre- 
sent? Why should there be any rhythmical unit 
at all, if the breath of the bard or reciter is not to 
be taken into account? 

" Every poet of eminence has not felt the fatigu- 
ing monotony of regular rhyme." It depends on 
how you class eminence. Milton says Satan was 
raised " to that bad eminence." 

" Shakespeare did not abandon rhyme in his 
maturer period (that is, in lyrical verse)." Does 
Mr. Alden seriously suppose that Shakespeare, 
when he was writing " The Tempest," said to him- 
self : " Go to ! this is sung by Ariel ; I must write 



lyrical verse, and lyrical verse must rhyme " ; and 
later : " Hold ! this is spoken by Prospero ; hence 
it is not lyrical and must be in blank verse " ? Does 
Mr. Alden suppose this? I have a problem, then, 
for his solution. Which is more lyrical, Ariel's 
"Ding dong bell" or Prospero's "Leave not a 
rack behind " ? JOHN GOULD FLETCHER.

[I am glad to see some further discussion by 
Mr. Fletcher of the matters touched on in his 
Preface, and should also enjoy pursuing the 
subject of two or three of them ; but it is clear 
that this cannot be done, except with more of 
assertion than proof, in the incidental space 
appropriate to the discussion of my review. 
A note or two of explanation may be added. 
It is quite true that the question whether the 
art of English poetry is in a greatly backward 
state is largely one of taste and judgment. 
I can only say, therefore, that my own impres- 
sion is shared by all the competent judges 
with whom I am acquainted, to the effect that 
the past few years have shown a marked and 
growing revival of poetry as a vital expression 
of contemporary thought in England and 
America, and that an encouraging amount of 
decidedly creditable verse is finding both pub- 
lication and sale. Perhaps I may claim some 
liberality in adding that I find evidence of the 
same thing even in the "new poetry," which 
I do not greatly admire, since it implies that 
an increasing number of persons, including 
some with no great rhythmical endowment, 
are turning to poetry as a means of sincere 
and serious expression. 

If in saying that " poets have attempted to 
make of their craft a Masonic secret." Mr. 
Fletcher meant only that they have not writ- 
ten many treatises on versification, I shall not 
press my denial. But I know of none who 
have not welcomed opportunities to discuss the 
subject and to give hints to younger men 
regarding their understanding of the rhyth- 
mical art. This is particularly true of two 
such great progressive metrists as Coleridge 
and Tennyson. 

I cannot answer the question, What does 
each line of a poem represent if not a single 
breath ? except by saying that it represents an 
arbitrary art pattern, like a unit of decoration 
on a Greek pediment, or the pitch intervals 
in the tempered scale. Various eccentric theo- 
ries have been suggested, from time to time, 
connecting our rhythmic types with the 
breath, as in the effort to conjecture why 
one race prefers longer lines than another, or 
rhythm of fours rather than threes, and the 
like ; but no authority on prosody accepts any 
of these. But here let me ask, if we assume 
that each line of verse does represent a breath,

is not the art of vers libre alarmingly unhy- 
gienic, in tending to develop such irregular 
breathing as it implies ? 

Mr. Fletcher appears to have understood 
me to say that Shakespeare never used un- 
rhymed verse for lyrical passages. I should 
be very far from making such a statement, or 
even from undertaking to answer the difficult 
question just what a lyrical passage is. The 
matter concerned was Mr. Fletcher's state- 
ment that in his maturer period Shakespeare 
abandoned rhyme. Now the only change 
which is known to Shakespearean criticism, in 
the poet's use of rhyme, is his dropping of the 
early fashion of using it in dramatic speech. 
His later plays are peculiarly rich in rhymed 
lyrics, and there is not the slightest evidence 
that he ever wearied of rhyme for ordinary 
lyrical purposes. Neither, so far as I know, 
has any eminent English poet save one 
Milton given evidence of a distaste for 
regular rhyme in his maturer years. It is 
harmless for any private person to dislike regu- 
lar rhyme and to abandon it, and quite un- 
necessary that he should twist metrical theory 
and history in his defence. THE REVIEWER.] 



THE AUTHOR OF " PONTEACH." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read with much interest the review by 
Mr. William B. Cairns, in your issue of July 15, 
of the reprint of " Ponteach," edited by Mr. Allan 
Nevins and published by the Caxton Club of Chi- 
cago. Of the author of " Ponteach," Robert Rog- 
ers, a celebrated Ranger during the French and 
Indian War, Mr. Cairns says : " It is difficult to 
see how a man completely sunk in dissipation 
could have attained the self -culture which Rogers 
shows." 

I am sure it would be a favor if Mr. Cairns or 
somebody else would point out to the students of 
this period of our history any evidence to prove 
that Rogers was a man of culture. 

It is at least my own opinion that Rogers's 
" Journals " and his " Concise Account " were 
written by some hack writer in London, who 
secured his information from Rogers or from Rog- 
ers's note-books. Anyone who will take the trouble 
to consult the " Documentary History of the State 
of New York," Vol. II., p. 205, etc., will see from 
Rogers's reports of his scouting expeditions as there 
printed, presumably from the originals, that he was 
so illiterate that he could not even spell his own 
name correctly at least not all the time, and 
some of the simplest words in the language were 
misspelled. W. H. S. 

New York City, July 23, 1915. 

[As I wished to make plain in my review, 
my interest in " Ponteach " is in the literary 
values and relationships of the play, and on 
matters of historical and biographical research 
I speak purely as a layman. The journals of 



Rogers's scouting expeditions in 1755, to 
which your correspondent refers, seem to me 
to show neither more nor less of crudity than 
might be expected in the work of a man with 
Rogers's lack of early training. This same 
ranger, whose orthography in 1755 so shocks 
your correspondent, was apparently able ten 
years later to impress favorably the social, 
official, and military circles of London, and to 
win, without money and in the face of strong 
American opposition, an important appoint- 
ment. He was also the author, or at the very 
least was believed by those who knew him to 
be the author, of two prose works and a verse 
drama which show some slight acquaintance 
with books as well as with life ; and his manu- 
script letters and journals of later date which 
I am able to examine in the library of the 
State Historical Society of Wisconsin are not 
in penmanship, wording, or even in spelling 
the work of a man who could be called illit- 
erate. This development indicates what I 
called "self-culture," though I should not 
quarrel in defence of the term. My argu- 
ment was that it made against the contention 
that Rogers was wholly given over to low vice. 
When I wrote I was not aware that the 
authorship of the " Journals " and the " Con- 
cise Account" was seriously questioned. I 
note that your correspondent, though he 
speaks without apparent hesitation of "the 
author of 'Ponteach,' Robert Rogers," ex- 
presses the opinion that Rogers did not write 
the prose works named. Doubtless Mr. Nev- 
ins would be glad, as I should, of any substan- 
tial evidence in support of this somewhat 
peculiar view. It would require more than 
the inconsistent spelling in the journals of 
Rogers's scouting days to have much weight.

AUTHORS AND KNIGHTHOOD. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It is not my place or desire to criticize, but as a 
regular reader of THE DIAL I feel constrained to 
utter a feeble protest against the tone of the edito- 
rial paragraph, " Plumed Knights," in your issue 
of July 15. 

It seems trivial and foreign to your practice to 
decry any time-honored custom of any land, much 
less the one that holds first place in the production 
of the best in literature. While we in America may 
have but little regard for knighthood, should we 
not at least respect it as being an outward sign of 
the appreciation of a people, bestowed by royalty 
though it may be, for one who has done something 
worthy? Since the authors of to-day accept this 
honor, we are not justified in belittling it, but 
should rather esteem it because of their acceptance.

A BREVIARY FOR CRITICS.* 

Close upon the heels of Mr. Brownell's criti- 
cal credo, recently reviewed in these pages, 
follows the manifesto of Mr. George Edward 
Woodberry, who takes rank with Mr. Brownell 
himself, Professor Irving Babbitt, and Mr. 
Paul Elmer More among the most conspicuous 
critics in America to-day. Like Mr. Brownell, 
Mr. Woodberry combines a kindly attitude 
toward the later modes of impressionism and 
appreciation with an eager desire to hold fast 
to the best in the old magisterial conception. 
He weighs and sifts the historical method for 
its dross of death and its life-gold, and he 
passes on to a sober but hymnlike adoration of 
art in its immortality which is perhaps the 
most exalting prose of its special kind since 
Shelley's "Defence of Poetry." 

In his first essay, Mr. Woodberry reminds 
us of an alluring conception of criticism as 
re-creation, but sets such a definition aside for 
a space while he considers how far the his- 
torical critic may understand a work of art 
as it was in another nation and in a dim past 
without re-creating it and thereby inevitably 
adding to it the color of his own personality. 
Mr. Woodberry calls upon us to remember 
Taine with admiration, but to make the large 
generalizations of the French critic more valid 
by putting against them the psychological crit- 
ic's absorption in the individual (with a pass- 
ing frown at the modern habit for hounding 
out the abnormal as essential in genius). A 
third group, " a hybrid of the sociologists and 
the psychologists," has arisen to dwell on great 
personalities amidst a maze of influences from 
nations and epochs, making criticism "an 
anatomy of texts." Criticism seems to draw 
" ever further away from the work of art 
itself ; it leaves the matter of life, which art is, 
for the matter of knowledge." Should we not 
then take warning and accept after all the 
definition formulated by recent critics? Can 
we re-create, however, and re-create " the work 
of art as it was in the mind of the original 
artist " ? To re-create not " a vision of our 
own" but the identical vision in the mind of 
the artist of the past is to enter the realms of 
history. Despite the universal qualities which 
we may readily perceive, there are " local and 
temporal associations" which require a most 
complete absorption to re-create in their integ- 
rity. In fact, you cannot re-create from any 
point of view (for all the hopes of recent

for the Woodberry Society. 



impressionists) unless you pay some attention 
to the historical method. 

" What, you will say, ' is not line the same 
beauty in a Greek or Japanese or Trench work ? has 
not color the same value? is not the human eye the 
same the world over?' Well, to begin with, the 
line is not the same, and it has different connota- 
tions; and so, also, of the color; and the human 
eye is as various as the soul that sees through it. 
Art is not like mathematics, something to be cast 
into identical formulas in every time and place. . . 
It is not so simple as observing a sunset; it is not 
merely to open your eyes and see; you must first 
create the eye to see with." 

And when we remember further that not only 
is art " a Protean play of personality in many 
places and ages" but also that no one of us 
sees the same thing in the same way, historical 
criticism may seem at best "only a doubtful 
resurrection of the soul that has passed away, 
a portrait, perhaps, but one in whose eyes 
and expression there is an unshared secret." 
Mr. Woodberry, however, warns us against 
growing lax in the great quest of the historical 
method, for it is the critic's only hope of 
qualifying himself " to undertake that purely 
aesthetic criticism " by which he 
" may at last become one with the soul of the artist 
and see his vision with the meaning and atmosphere 
it had to himself. So much of art is antique and 
foreign, so much of what is racially our own has 
become alien to my feelings and ideas by the grad- 
ual detachment of time, that I need an interpreter 
between me and this dead and dying world of the 
past, I need precisely the interpretation of knowl- 
edge that historical criticism gives. True, it is not 
aesthetic criticism; but aesthetic criticism, in the 
sense of a re-creation of art as it was in the past, 
for me is impossible without it." 
Nor should we excuse criticism from the func- 
tion of judgment as well as interpretation. It 
must do more than content itself with asking : 
What was in the mind of the artist ? Has he 
expressed it? Was his method well or ill 
adapted ? Is his result worth the pains ? The 
artist may hold himself free from rules : but 
not so, with impunity, the critic. Mr. Wood- 
berry comes close to Mr. Brownell when he 
declares that " we who find in the merely hu- 
man world no guide so safe as reason, look to 
criticism to declare the judgment of reason on 
the intellectual and moral values of art." Nor 
is art itself, as is so often averred, mere " sense- 
perceiving; but it gathers into its energy the 
whole play of personality, and is a power of 
the total soul." Reason aids in its fashioning. 
" It is a rationalized and spiritualized world, the 
world that ought to be, an ideal world, though 
found only fragmentarily in any individual or 
period or country. Art is not a spontaneous gen- 
eration and geyser, as it were, of the senses at play 
in their world of mere phenomena; but it is a

THE DIAL

world-creator, the maker of a new and complete 
world, one not superficial and momentary merely, 
but a world with meaning, loaded with all the sig- 
nificance that man has found in his spiritual life." 
Hence the permanence of great art, even 
though it may happen that the artist himself 
be no thinker but rather one who expresses 
half unrealizingly the vision of a community. 
He may not speak as some others do, in 
abstractions ; but he utters what is neverthe- 
less "intellectual and moral truth, spiritual 
truth." 

" The prime contrast between art and nature [is] 
... an opposition of freedom to necessity, of the 
soul to the body, of spirituality to materialism. 
Art is the soul's confession. I should be ill-content 
if works of art, taken individually, yielded to the 
critic only a momentary experience of the senses 
and feelings, as if they were merely disparate 
objects of nature. I desire to know their meanings 
to the soul; and that intellectual and moral ele- 
ments enter into their meaning, and that without 
the cooperation of the reason they are incompletely 
known, seems to me plain. . . Each school, each 
age, each race has its own art, often highly indi- 
vidualized and peculiar to itself. . . The diversity 
of art not only makes interpretation necessary to 
its understanding, but also renders judgment of its 
value, intellectual, moral, technical, very useful, 
both in guiding the mind in its choice and in estab- 
lishing the relative place that any particular artist 
or art period has in the whole field. . . Contempla- 
tion without judgment is a barren attitude, though 
judgment need not confine itself to comparing 
greater and lesser." 

The revolt against such criticism springs prob- 
ably from " a discontent with that immersion 
in the dead past of knowledge which is often 
the scholar's lot, and from a desire to confine 
our interest in art within those limits where 
art is alive." With this we may sympathize. 
But many of these hardships are inevitable. 
Let us not, like the futurists, consider the past 
as merely in the way. Even " in realizing the 
dead selves of mankind, the soul accumulates 
power, breadth of outlook, tolerance and espe- 
cially, I think, faith and hope." But for all 
this solace, " one is often fain to ask, ' Is 
there no rescue from this reign of death, which 
is history, and how shall it be accomplished ?' " 

The answer, thinks Mr. Woodberry, should 
lie in aesthetic criticism. 

" Is it an error to relegate art to the dead past 
and translate it into history? Works of art are 
not like political events and persons; they do not 
pass at once away. The Hermes of Praxiteles is 
still with us. Is it really the same Hermes that it 
was when it was made? Is its personal identity a 
fixed state, or does its personality, like our own, 
change in the passage of time? May it not be the 
nature of art to cast off what is mortal, and emanci- 
pate itself from the mind of its creator? " 

Is there something beyond " that mortal and 



temporary part which historical criticism pre- 
serves " ? Yes. ^Esthetic criticism may try to 
re-create " the image before us apart from any 
attempt to realize what was in the artist's 
mind, or with only a passing reference to 
that." Expression, " the nucleus of the artist's 
power," is " the process of externalizing what 
was in the artist's mind, in some object of 
sense which shall convey it to others." " The 
natural object . . is enveloped in his feeling," 
his personality, which is immaterial. Sugges- 
tion, half-lights, the inexpressible, play about 
a work of art. " In so far as a work of art is a 
thing of nature, it can be expressed materially 
with the more adequacy; in so far as it is a 
thing of spirit, of personality, it is less subject 
to complete and certain expression ; and in all 
art there are these two elements." No two 
people can realize this play of spirit in exactly 
the same way. "Rifts of temperament and 
varieties of expression between artist and spec- 
tator make chasms of misunderstanding and 
misappreciation." " Every reader thinks that 
he is Hamlet." To make every reader think 
so is to be a genius, a universal writer. 
"Whence arises this paradox, so common in 
art, of infinite diversity in identity? It 
comes from the fact that, so far from realiz- 
ing the image as it was in the artist's mmd 
and receiving it charged with his personality 
merely, it is we ourselves who create the image 
by charging it with our own personality." 

" It is one of the charms of art that it is not 
to be completely understood. In an age in 
which so high a value is put upon facts, in- 
formation, positive knowledge, it is a relief to 
have still reserved to us a place apart where 
it is not necessary to know all." The truth of 
art grows ever with time " more rich in signifi- 
cance, more profound in substance, disclosing 
heaven over heaven and depth under depth." 
The greatest books grow old with us. So it is 
that great artists become lifelong studies. Our 
powers of appreciation vary, and our way is. 
"commonly blocked by certain inhibitions 
which are so lodged in the mind by education 
and opinion that they effectively paralyze any 
effort at re-creation." The Puritans feared 
the drama. The respectable American turns 
hastily and pruriently away from the nude 
figure and the shame is his, not the artist's. 
With such limitations we fall short of the 
artist's vision. Yet, on the other hand, we may 
give his work of art beautiful meanings of 
which he did not dream. 

" The essence of the work, its living power for 
us, is not what the artist put in it, but what we 
draw from it ; its world-value is not what it was to 
the artist, but what it is to the world. . . Thus 
arises the paradox . . that it is not the poet, but

the reader, who writes the poem. . . New ages 
appropriate the works of the past by accomplish- 
ing a partial transformation in them, and unless 
art is capable of such a remaking it cannot last." 
So it was that Pater in his " creative criticism " 
re-created art, "a marvellous blend of the 
modern spirit with ancient material." All his 
figures, "Dionysus, or French gallants, or 
Roman gentlemen, . . are developed in the 
dark chamber of his own singularly sensitive 
and refined artistic temperament." Thus the 
Puritans re-created the Old Testament. We 
need not abolish war and the wine-cup as 
beautiful poetic imagery even in chaster days ; 
they may adorn and vivify the poetry of an 
age of new ideals, and do these rich service. 

Works of art are not, then, to Mr. Wood- 
berry " historical monuments valuable for the 
information they give of the past," but 
" new material, for us to work our own statues and 
pictures and poems out of ; or, in a word, to create 
the forms of our own souls out of; for the soul 
must be given forms in order to be aware of its 
being, to know itself, truly to be. The soul moves 
toward self-expression in many ways, but in finding 
forms for itself the soul discovers its most plastic 
material in the world of art. It is in forms of 
ideality that the soul hastens to clothe itself; and 
while it is possible for us to elaborate such forms 
from the crude mass of nature, as the first artists 
did, yet later generations are the more fortunate in 
that they possess in art and literature a vast treas- 
ure of ideality already elaborated and present. 
Works of art thus constitute a select material 
wherein the artist-soul that is in each of us can 
work, not only with our own native force of pene- 
tration and aspiration, but, as it were, with higher 
aid, the aid of genius, the aid of the select souls 
of the race." 

Thus art casts off "what is mortal," and 
emancipates "itself from the mind of its 
creator " " to enter upon a life of its own, con- 
tinually renewed in the minds of those who 
appropriate it." The reader who appropriates 
may be a Pater; he may be far humbler, he 
may be far greater. Such fame outlasts biog- 
raphy. The poet's memory becomes ideal. 

"And then this miracle arises that into the soul 
of Virgil, for example, enters a Christian soul, 
new-born, and deepening its pathos. . . That is 
earthly immortality, the survival and increment 
of the spirit through time. Thus arises another 
paradox, that as art begins by being charged with 
personality, it ends by becoming impersonal, solv- 
ing the apparent contradiction in the soul universal, 
the common soul of mankind. Each of us creates 
art in his own image, it seems an infinite varia- 
ble ; and yet it is the variable of something identical 
in all the soul. . . It is thus in the artistic life 
that one shares in the soul universal, the common 
soul of mankind, which yet is manifest only in indi- 
viduals and their concrete work. Art like life has 
its own material being in the concrete, but the spir- 
itual being of both is in the universal." 



Now observe that when, " from time to 
time in history our ancestors encountered suc- 
cessively alien literatures, and as each was in 
turn appropriated, a Renaissance resulted," 
and thus " civilization has grown in body and 
quality, ever enriching itself by what it ab- 
sorbs from this and that particular race and 
age." It is tragic folly to isolate nations and 
races, to learn race self-sufficiency and, after 
that, race suspicion and race hate. Beware of 
the reactionary tendency growing in America. 
Remember, too, that the individual, like the 
nation, like civilization, must have his periodi- 
cal renaissance. Goethe needed his Italian 
journey. Shelley was reborn when he read 
Plato. 

The artist-life is " a life of discovery," not 
of truth but of faculty ; not so much " an ac- 
quisition of knowledge " as " an acquisition of 
inward power." 

" The most wonderful thing in the soul is the 
extraordinary latency of power in it; and it is in 
the artist-life, in the world of art, that this latent 
power is most variously and brilliantly released. 
What happens to you when you begin to see, really 
to see, pictures, for example ? It is not that a new 
object has come within the range of your vision; 
but that a new power of seeing has arisen in your 
eye, and through this power a new world has opened 
before you, a world of such marvels of space, 
color, and beauty, luminosity, shadow, and line, 
atmosphere and disposition, that you begin to live 
in it as a child begins to learn to live in the natural 
world. It is not the old world seen piecemeal; it 
is a new world on another level of being than 
natural existence. So, when you begin to take in a 
poem, it is not a mere fanciful arrangement of 
idea and event added to your ordinary memory of 
things ; new powers of feeling have opened in your 
heart that constitute a fresh passion of life there, 
and as you feed it with lyric and drama, a signifi- 
cance, a mystery, a light enter into the universe as 
you know it, with transforming and exalting power. 
To the lover of pictures the visible world has be- 
come something other than it was, even nature 
herself flowers with Corots and Manets, coruscates 
with Turners and Claudes, darkens with Rem- 
brandts; to the lover of poetry also the visible 
world has suffered change and lies in the light of 
Wordsworth or of Shelley, but much more the 
invisible world of inward life is transformed into 
visions of human fate in ^Eschylus and Shakspere, 
into throbs of passion in Dante and Petrarch, into 
cries of ecstasy and pain in how many generations 
of the poets world-wide. It is not that you have 
acquired knowledge ; you have acquired heart. To 
lead the artist-life is not to look at pictures and 
read books; it is to discover the faculties of the 
soul, that slept unknown and unused, and to apply 
them in realizing the depth and tenderness, the elo- 
quence, the hope and joy of the life that is within. 
It is by this that the life of art differs from the 
life of science: its end is not to know but to be."

Therefore we revolt against the historical 
treatment of art because we feel that it endan- 
gers art's own true nature, degrades it into 
mere knowledge, loses sight of life. " The first 
place is held by life. It is against the substitu- 
tion of knowledge for life in scholarship, espe- 
cially in the literary and artistic fields, that 
the protest is made." 

"A second main trait of the artist-life of the 
soul . . is that it is a life of growth by an inward 
secret and mysterious process. There is nothing 
mechanical in it; it is vital. It was this aspect of 
the soul's life which Wordsworth brought so promi- 
nently forward, and made elemental in his verse, 
advocating a ( wise passiveness ' in the conduct of 
the mind. . . ' Consider the lilies, how they grow : 
they toil not, neither do they spin.' That is the 
type of the artist-soul; in the artist-life there is 
neither toiling nor spinning. In an economical 
civilization like ours, leisure is apt to be confounded 
with indolence, and it is hard to see how the poet 
watching 

' the sun illume 
The yellow bees in the ivy bloom ' 

is not an idler in the land. Especially is it hard to 
see how things will come without planning. In our 
own day planning has become an all-engrossing 
occupation. A belief in organization has spread 
through the country, and is applied in all quarters 
of life, as if success were always a matter of 
machinery. Even in the churches, which have been 
the home of spiritual force, organization plays an 
ever-increasing part, as if failure in driving-force 
could be made up for by appliances in the machine ; 
to a certain extent this is possible, but the driving 
force is not the machine. The practical reason so 
occupies all the field of our life that the result is to 
belittle and destroy whatever has not its ground of 
being in the useful. Art, by its own nature, 
excludes the useful." 

"A third main trait of the world of art is 
that it is a place of freedom," not merely 
"from the manacle of utility" but, on the 
positive side, a power to transcend nature and 
to reconstitute "the world in the image" of 
the souPs 

" own finer vision and deeper wisdom, realizing 
ideality in its own consciousness and conveying at 
least the shadow of its dream to mankind. . . Each 
of us, in reading the play, may well believe he is 
Hamlet, but each is well aware that he is identify- 
ing himself with a more perfect type of himself, 
such as is known only to the mind's eye. . . The 
fruit of this large freedom is the ideal world, in 
which each realizes his dream of the best. It is 
here that experiments are made, that revolutions 
sometimes begin ; for the ideal, . . once expressed, 
passes back into the ordinary world, and there it 
may be made a pattern, a thing to be actualized, 
and it falls under the dominance of the practical 
reason and has this or that fortune according to 
the wisdom or folly of mankind at the time. . . 
There are times . . when the ideal world does enter 
into the actual world, and partly permeate it, if it 



does not wholly master it. The classic, the chivalric, 
the Christian world attest the fact broadly; and in 
individual life how must we ourselves bear witness 
to the mingling in ourselves of the poets' blood, 
which is the blood of the world. In the intimacy of 
this communion is our best of life, and it is accom- 
plished solely by the re-creation in us, in our minds 
and hearts, our hopes, admirations and loves, of 
what was first in the artists of every sort, according 
to our capacity to receive and reembody in our own 
spiritual substance their finer, wiser, deeper, power. 
Their capacity to enter thus into the life of human- 
ity is the measure of their genius, and our capacity 
to receive the gift is the measure of our souls." 

" The poets are often spoken of as prophets, and 
in history the greatest are those most lonely peaks 
that seem to have taken the light of an unrisen 
dawn, like Virgil, whose humanity in the Aeneid 
shines with a foregleam of the Christian tempera- 
ment, or like Plato, whose philosophy in many a 
passage was a morning star that went before the 
greater light of Christian faith in the divine. But 
it is not such poets and such prophecy that I have 
in mind. I mean that in our own experiences in 
this artist-life with the poets, sculptors, and musi- 
cians there abides the feeling that we shall have, 
as Tennyson says, * the wages of going on,' there 
is our clearest intimation of immortality. Words- 
worth found such intimations in fragments of his 
boyhood and youth. I find them rather in frag- 
ments of manhood and maturer life. Life im- 
presses me less as a birth initially out of the divine 
into mortal being than as birth into the divine at 
each step of the onward way." 

Such a life is not reserved for the select alone ; 
it is open to all. " The child with his picture- 
book and the dying Laureate reading the 
Shaksperian 'Dirge' in the moonlight lead 
the same life and follow the same method. The 
boy with Homer, the sage with Plato, it is all 
one : each is finding his soul, and living in it." 
We must strive for a more just economic 
order "to lessen the burden of common life" 
and give each individual time to rejoice in 
this artist-life, his birthright, no matter how 
humble he may be. 

" We are all proud of America, and look on our 
farms and workshops, the abundance of work, the 
harvest of universal gain dispersed through multi- 
tudes reclaimed from centuries of poverty, we 
see and proclaim the greatness of the good ; but I 
am ill-content with the spiritual harvest, with the 
absence of that which has been the glory of great 
nations in art and letters, with the indifference to 
that principle of human brotherhood in devotion to 
which our fathers found greatness and which is 
most luminous in art and letters; our enormous 
success in the economical and mechanical sphere 
leaves me unreconciled to our failure to enter the 
artistic sphere as a nation." 

Mr. Woodberry is certainly timely in his 
warnings against history and historical criti- 
cism, which tend to-day so often to substitute 
knowledge for life. But I should be inclined 



102 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



to say that he turns away from historical criti- 
cism, after he has said many fine things in its 
praise, with a too audible sigh of relief. The 
greatest critics in the generations to follow, 
now that the new genre of criticism has devel- 
oped so rapidly and so richly, must be so 
robust that their " aesthetic criticism " may be 
superimposed on a very massive foundation of 
historical research. I can conceive of a criti- 
cism which could wed the dryasdust but in- 
valuable method of the most plodding and 
terrify ingly erudite contributions to "schol- 
arly journals" (contributions bristling with 
citations) with the most alert receptivity and 
nimble play of moods and soaring imagination 
of the most sensitive impressionist. This may 
seem to Mr. Woodberry, and to the readers of 
his book or even of my synopsis, but an exag- 
gerated underlining of certain of his own 
statements. Yet if I am but underlining his 
fundamental precepts, I would do it even at 
the risk of masquerading with the plumage 
and the voice of a parrot. I underline because 
I feel a certain danger in many of Mr. Wood- 
berry's passages. Time and again he seems to 
conceive of idealism and fact as enemies as 
implacable as the Persian deities Ormuzd and 
Ahriman, with their endless armies of radiant 
angels and swart demons. Surely idealism 
which is not fragile in the face of the first 
stroke of healthy disillusionment must rise 
phoenix-like out of fact, which it does not 
oppose but from which it is splendidly born. 
Mr. Woodberry has communed with Plato and 
within himself, in many an awed and happy 
vigil, over the problem of the One and the 
Many, and has clearly seen with Spenser how 
change does but again and again dilate with- 
out destroying an eternal being. But some of 
those other opposites which bewilder us in all 
but our most adventurous moments, for all his 
care (though he often manages them bravely, 
like two fiery coursers held for a time in yoke) , 
fly apart and almost shatter his chariot at 
times in the highest moments of his Phaethon- 
ride. 

Not only is Mr. Woodberry's reconciliation 
of historical and aesthetic criticism a little 
faltering, but at .times he seems to think of 
society as led by a few highly endowed critics 
as well as poets, at times a benignant Utopian 
anarchy in which everybody may be a critic 
with a poet's soul, a richly trained creative 
reader. I know that he would make sorrowing 
concessions that many are debarred within the 
fell clutch of circumstance. He protests elo- 
quently against our unjust economic order. 
But he passes by a fundamental protest with- 
out which we can never have a just economic 
order when he concedes with so many agstheti- 



cians that the useful and the artistic cannot be 
reconciled. " Our bodies and our mortal inter- 
ests," he says, " are subject to the world of 
use; but our spirituality, our immortal part, 
is above use." Here I for one am prepared 
undauntedly to open the pages of a book often 
reviled by artist and economist, Buskin's 
" Crown of Wild Olive," at the opening pages 
of the chapter called " Traffic," and protest 
with the writer against the false opposition of 
art and utility. I also (though I am one of 
those who believe that after death we go on as 
individuals, in being dilated but fundamen- 
tally the same) am here on earth to say that 
I will brook no deep distinction between my 
"physical" and my "spiritual" self. The 
highest love is uncompromisingly physical and 
uncompromisingly spiritual, though few are 
strenuous enough to learn its deep and lasting 
rewards because few are strenuous to learn 
with their comrade how to love before they 
love. The highest art should be useful ; there 
is no distinction there, any more than there is 
here on earth between body and soul. Mr. 
Woodberry has fallen into an asceticism, 
not the athletic asceticism of temporary re- 
straint for purposes of purer enjoyment, but 
the asceticism of fear: an asceticism, with 
Mr. Woodberry, delicate, more tender, warmer 
than its old parent of the grey twilight but 
born out of it, bred of its bone, marked with 
its lineaments. Mr. Woodberry remains, after 
all, a champion of the old feudalistic art, an 
art which now would be communal but fails, 
an art which now loves but also still fears the 
populace, an art which fears the useful. The 
Greeks created something like a communal 
art at the expense of slaves who did the 
drudgery. To-day, though we have declared 
ourselves against slavery and have freed all 
nominal slaves (and to have declared our- 
selves, merely, means great progress) , we live 
in an age of actual slavery more widespread 
than that of any previous age. And this is 
partly because we refuse to face squarely the 
problem of drudgery. Mr. Woodberry makes 
a wise distinction between soft indolence (that 
herald of all the other deadly sins) and beau- 
tiful leisure. But he should realize that so 
long as drudgery remains a reality, the toiler 
in the realms of drudgery (if he survives) or 
his son or daughter (if he is successful) will 
never distinguish between leisure and more 
obvious, most alluring indolence. We must 
face the problem that the Greeks shirked. 
We must declare that nothing is impossible 
but that one word "impossible." We must 
declare drudgery to be a phantasm which has 
been tricked out in borrowed flesh and blood 
too long. And we may make at least one fair

HERBERT ELLSWORTH CORY. 



CHILDREN OF THE CITY.* 



" Public opinion has a curious trick of suddenly 
regarding as a living moral issue, vital and un- 
appeasable, some old situation concerning which 
society has been indifferent for many years. The 
newly moralized issue, almost as if by accident, 
suddenly takes fire and sets whole communities in 
a blaze, lighting up human relationships and 
public duty with a new meaning, in the end trans- 
forming an abstract social ideal into a political 
demand for new legal enactments. When that 
blaze actually starts, when the theme is heated, 
molten as it were with human passion and desire, 
it is found that there are many mature men and 
women of moral purpose and specialized knowl- 
edge who have become efficient unto life. Among 
them are those who have long felt a compunction 
in regard to the ill-adjustment of which society 
has become conscious and are eager to contribute 
to the pattern of juster human relations." 

Thus writes Miss Addams in her preface 
to " Safeguards for City Youth," a book de- 
scribing the work and experiences of the 
Juvenile Protective Association of Chicago. 
These same winged words might well have 
stood 011 the title-page of each of the five books 
now before us, for all are symptoms of the 
same awakening, the same desire of "mature 
men and women of moral purpose" to be 
doing something to mend the evil of their day, 
and prevent that of the days to come. This 
new impulse, developing " almost as if by acci- 
dent," is nevertheless the fruit of the toil of 
years, as Miss Addams well knows, being her- 
self chief among the toilers. It is fortunate 
that it is so, for herein is a certain guarantee 
of stability, an assurance that this new birth 
of the social conscience is but the emerging 
into the light of a growth which has been 
patiently maturing for many a day. 

The Juvenile Protective Association is not 
a mere society for the prevention of cruelty 
to children, but an organized attempt to study

the conditions surrounding childhood in Chi- 
cago, and remedy some of the evils for which 
Society is responsible. Indeed, the word 
"juvenile" is interpreted broadly, as includ- 
ing young people of mature growth, who need 
protection as they enter the ranks of labor. 
This protection must come largely through 
enlightened public opinion ; so we are begged 
to note that "all of the stores make large 
profits at the holiday season, but they are 
made at the expense of thousands of employ- 
ees, whose weary feet and aching backs are 
the result of the mad rush on the part of thou- 
sands of Christian people who are thus seek- 
ing to express the kindliness and good will 
which our Christmas commemorates ! " or 
again that " the same kind-hearted people who, 
in great concern, would quickly gather around 
the victim of a street accident, carelessly eat 
food placed before them by a frail girl almost 
fainting with fatigue or heedlessly walk 
through a hotel corridor lately scrubbed by a 
Polish woman who has spent ten hours upon 
her hands and knees." The object of Mrs. 
Bowen's book is to enable us to see the 
machinery back of the passing show, and real- 
ize the cruelty and stupidity of so much of 
it; thereby arousing not merely the wish for 
reform, but the hope of being able to better 
things. 

A minute study of the social environment 
would be largely futile with the other element 
of the problem, the nature of the individual, 
left out of account. Consequently " the Asso- 
ciation is at present making a careful study 
of sub-normal children, of whom it is esti- 
mated that there are about 6000 in Chicago. 
Approximately only one-tenth of this number 
can be received at the one State Institution 
for the Feeble-Minded in Illinois." This ap- 
palling problem is matched by another, not 
wholly unrelated, and we read : " One of the 
most pathetic sights in Chicago is the venereal 
disease ward for children in the County Hos- 
pital. In twenty-seven months, 600 children 
under twelve years of age passed through this 
ward 60 per cent of them had contracted 
the disease accidentally; 20 per cent of them 
had inherited it, and another 20 per cent had 
been criminally assaulted by diseased per- 
sons." 

Mrs. Schoff, in her study of " The Wayward 
Child," approaches the subject with the same 
zeal, and writes with the knowledge gained 
from many years of work. Her point of view 
is not scientific, and she is inclined to regard 
the problem in an old-fashioned way. Thus 
we are assured that "when carried back to 
William the Conqueror each child has, accord- 
ing to President G. Stanley Hall, eight billion 



104 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



ancestors. From so many as eight billion 
ancestors, each child must certainly have a 
very mixed heredity, and we may be encour- 
aged about the matter even more by remem- 
bering that man was created in the image and 
likeness of God and that consequently there 
must be some good in every one." The propo- 
sition that every human life is " worth while," 
and should be given the best possible chance, 
is one to which we may cordially assent; but 
even the testimony of President G. Stanley 
Hall will not make us believe in those eight 
billion ancestors. By the same arithmetical 
process it will be apparent that at the time of 
Julius Caesar our ancestors covered the earth 
many layers deep. These, however, are minor 
matters; and when it comes to the practical 
things of life, Mrs. Schoff has much good 
advice to give. Thus : " More than half of the 
children in the juvenile court during eight 
years were there for stealing. No one could 
listen to the stories of theft of every sort told 
by these children without reaching the conclu- 
sion that honesty does not come without con- 
structive parental teaching." Judging from 
the testimony of thousands of prison inmates, 
it is concluded that reform schools have ex- 
actly the opposite effect from that suggested 
by their name. Recognizing the unconscious 
prejudice of the narrators, who in telling their 
experiences tend to place all the blame on 
their surroundings, we must nevertheless ad- 
mit that the testimony is weighty, and after 
all not different from what we might reason- 
ably expect. Even high class boarding schools 
for "young gentlemen" are sometimes nests 
of more corruption than we care to admit. 

" Street-Land," by Mr. Philip Davis of Bos- 
ton, is a volume of " The "Welfare Series," 
edited by Mr. E. T. Hale. It gives a clear 
account of the life of city children in the 
streets, their efforts to find work and amuse- 
ment, their troubles and temptations. It also 
describes the Newsboys' Republic, and sets 
forth a programme for the future. Ulti- 
mately, the solution must be found in a radical 
reorganization of city life. " Since it is the 
almost savage environment which makes many 
city children little savages, we must learn that 
our chief task is to civilize the environment. 
Nor can this be accomplished by philanthropy 
or law. These are curative, not preventive, 
agencies. Sound economics, made popular by 
safe investments in homes for the people built 
by the municipality or State, as in Letch- 
worth, England, and in Belgium, alone will 
ultimately abolish slums and slum products 
and prevent their reproduction in the rising 
cities of America." It is to be noted, however, 
that if mere legal enactments cannot do away 



with the evil, they can and do perpetuate it, 
preventing municipalities from taking the 
steps necessary to create decent conditions. 

Dr. Eliot's book on "The Juvenile Court 
and the Community " is an attempt to define 
the status of the Juvenile Court, and deter- 
mine its proper functions. It is recognized 
that the Court has undergone an evolution, 
whereby the court business proper has dimin- 
ished in proportion to the ever extending pro- 
bation system. Volunteer probation is giving 
way to organized municipal work, and "in 
most places needs simply a death blow to ' put 
it out of its misery.' " The probation officer is 
called upon to cooperate with all existing 
agencies, and thus finds himself no longer 
exclusively connected with the Court. The 
point is made that probation is a part of the 
educational system, and should have its prin- 
cipal point of contact with the schools rather 
than with any judicial system. The Domestic 
Relations Court could take care of the other 
functions of the Juvenile Court, which would 
thus disappear, its activities having been 
absorbed by other agencies. *' The writer be- 
lieves that the evidence shows that the juve- 
nile court has been for its time a splendid 
institution," but that it represents a stage in 
evolution, leading to better things. If the 
Juvenile Court represents a transitory stage, 
it is still evident that in most places this stage 
has not yet passed. All students of the Court 
recognize that it is changing, growing in 
various directions to meet the public need, 
and, as it were, producing new departments 
by a process of budding. The time is ripe for 
such discussions as that of Dr. Eliot's, but 
they are perhaps to be taken with a grain of 
salt, on Bergsonian grounds. It is probable 
that different cities, attempting to solve their 
problems in different ways, will find that there 
is no single road to municipal efficiency. 
Escaping from one difficulty we meet some 
other. The Juvenile Court has had a hard 
struggle with the politicians ; but let the diffi- 
cult work of probation fall under the direc- 
tion of the School Board, and we may find 
that timidity, indecision, and fear of "injur- 
ing business" are harder to combat than 
downright crookedness. In any case, the onus 
is thrown back upon the community, and no 
mere system will make amends for a stupid 
public. 

The " West Side Studies " carried on by the 
Russell Sage Foundation constitute a most 
valuable contribution to descriptive sociology. 
They have the merit of being exceedingly well 
written, so that the narrative flows and has 
coherence, instead of appearing to be a patch- 
work made up from accumulated memoranda.

While the purpose is descriptive, and there is 
little direct propaganda for reform, the vivid 
accounts of conditions found point so clearly 
to the weak spots in civic life that the reader 
cannot help drawing his own conclusions con- 
cerning remedies. The writers enter into their 
subject with such a warmth of human sym- 
pathy that we no longer see merely things to 
criticize, but come to feel that after all the 
very troubles of the city carry with them the 
germs of hope for better times.

THE BLUE-STOCKINGS AND THEIR 



When Samuel Johnson, Fanny Burney, 
Hannah More, and other celebrities of their 
time meet together in a critical volume, that 
book is assured of readers ; for who can resist 
the appeal of the Age of Tea and Talk? If 
the book succeeds, it may be due to no special 
merit of its author, his audience is predis- 
posed to enjoy his work. However, in the case 
of Professor Tinker's study of "The Salon 
and English Letters," the author's part is of 
an unusually important and distinctive char- 
acter. Unostentatious, sympathetic, thor- 
oughly keen in his analyses, this professor of 
English Literature at Yale has presented a 
new view of the years 1760-1790 by means of 
centring his observations on the salon and 
its influences. Until the publication of this 
book we have had no authority, in English, 
upon the salon, and have been forced to gain 
information from dozens of scattered volumes. 
Now we possess, in Professor Tinker's work, 
a scholarly and succinct account of one of the 
most interesting, and often amusing, phases 
of human history. 

Beginning with the French salon, Profes- 
sor Tinker outlines rapidly the origin and 
development of those "literary courts," and 
traces their relationship to the courtly groups 
of the Renaissance which were presided over 
by such women as Beatrice d'Este, Caterina 
Cornaro of Browning's Asolo, and the ladies 
mentioned in Castiglione's " Book of the Cour- 
tier." The Hotel de Rambouillet, most dis- 
tinguished of all the French salons, was 
established, in direct imitation of these Ital- 
ian assemblies, by a lady half Italian herself ; 
and in the chavnbre blue d'Arthenice the 
select few, not more than eighteen, carried on 
their exalted conversations. Very briefly, 
Professor Tinker characterizes the salons,

relations of Literature and Society in the Age of Johnson.

showing how important was the place of gath- 
ering, the aesthetic background, in establish- 
ing the right tone; and he makes clear the 
earnest effort of the leaders to promote a real 
democracy of intellect, by giving encourage- 
ment to any person of genuine wit and origi- 
nality. Dominated by woman, the salon 
expressed her "instinct for society and for 
literature," arousing discussion, provoking 
conversation on topics literary or philosophi- 
cal. Sermons and profane literature were 
themes for all to discourse upon ; and in those 
days "club" folk read the works they dis- 
cussed. Out of the talk grew some species of 
literature, chiefly those forms which express 
more intimately the ideas and sentiments of 
every-day life, letters, memoirs, and similar 
friendly productions in both prose and verse. 
Perhaps more significant than the attitude 
toward letters and art are the relationships, 
the friendships, fostered by the salons. On 
this topic Professor Tinker is almost too 
brief ; he does not bring out the fullest mean- 
ing of the development of personality, the 
shaping and enriching of individual talents, 
stimulated by the familiar intercourse of 
these coteries. 

From France to England the sentiment for 
similar literary groups was speedily trans- 
ferred ; and England did justice to the ideal, 
not by any means wholly new. Elizabethan 
England had had literary courts, and the 
Countess of Pembroke will be remembered as 
one of the noblest patronesses of all time. 
With the Restoration came the insidious 
amorousness which vitiated the salons, turn- 
ing the library coterie into a school for scan- 
dal. By the end of the seventeenth century 
the feminist movement was well under way; 
and of the manifestations of literary mili- 
tancy Professor Tinker has little to say, since 
that aspect of life has little to do with the 
salons, which are devoted to conversation. It 
is with the rise of the Bluestocking Club that 
the salon definitely reappears in England. 
This Club, which was probably in existence 
by 1760, was composed of "Vesey," "Bos- 
cawen," " Montagu," " Carter," Hannah More, 
Lord Lyttelton, Horace Walpole, and others. 
"Bluestocking," that genteel by- word of con- 
tempt, is discussed by Professor Tinker very 
fully, although he says plainly that no defi- 
nitely satisfactory conclusions can be reached 
concerning its origin. It would seem that it 
arose from the practice of ridiculing the 
severely plain dress of the Puritans, who, in 
their homely woolen hose, made up that 
" Blew-stocking Parliament " so odious to the 
silk-clad Cavaliers. A term thus used to cast 
reproach upon really sincere and high-

minded folk was no bad title for a group who, 
feeling the popular associations with that 
word, rather enjoyed assuming its connota- 
tions. " Blues " and " blue " came to mean 
cultured ladies, or " shocking females" ac- 
cording to the intelligence of the critic. It is 
in these chapters dealing with the Bluestock- 
ings that the volume is most interesting, for 
the author has put together various fragmen- 
tary bits, making a comparatively unified 
whole. Of course any work which considers 
so miscellaneous a subject as the lives and atti- 
tudes and accomplishments of numerous 
minor personages cannot possess perfect 
smoothness of transition. The difficulties of 
the case, however, have been well met; and 
Professor Tinker has furnished us with a 
storehouse of information, anecdote, criticism, 
interpretation of character, and small talk 
delightfully arrayed. Special praise is due 
for the sane, generous, respectful tone in 
which he writes. To all except anti-suffra- 
gists his studiously judicial manner will ap- 
peal strongly. It is easy to be flippant and 
witty at the expense of the shallow and artifi- 
cial intellectual life of the Bluestockings. For 
instance, revered Hannah More has been made 
the subject of many gibes; but just as Pro- 
fessor Tinker publishes a charmingly youth- 
ful portrait of her, so he endeavors to present, 
not the apparent pedant and literary trifler, 
but the woman who sincerely strove for high 
accomplishment. With the best of opportuni- 
ties for making merry over "lovely woman/' 
the critic has not indulged in caricature, or 
satire, or condescension. This is not saying 
that he lacks humor. Some of the charm in 
these chapters lies in the shrewd brevity of 
the recitals that reveal all the truth, the ludi- 
crous self-esteem, as well as the inner motives, 
the highest aspirations, the fine ideals of the 
members of the English salons. Engaging 
minor details are given generously, and in 
such a quotation as the following one per- 
ceives the Spartan nature of the day: 

" I never knew a party turn out so pleasantly as 
the other night at the Pepys's. There was all the 
pride of London every wit and every wit-ess . . 
but the spirit of the evening was kept up on the 
strength of a little lemonade till past eleven, with- 
out cards, scandal, or politics." 

For portraiture there is the sketch of Mrs. 
Vesey, or "the sylph," who was most supreme 
when youth and beauty had long left her 
alone with her unflagging imagination and 
her friends. 

The third section of the book concerns itself 
with the expression of the social instinct in 
Conversation, Familiar Correspondence, the 
Diary, and the Intimate Biography, illus- 



trated of course by the famous names of the 
day, Johnson, Fanny Burney, Walpole, and 
Boswell. These chapters, dealing with mat- 
ter more familiar to the general reader, are 
written in a lively yet non-partisan fashion. 
They show the results of long study of these 
special themes, hence they will prove to have 
critical freshness. Johnson is revealed in all 
his irrevocable humanness, not as Ursa Major, 
but as the intensely social being who lived on 
talk, and whose talk roused and galvanized 
others into effective expression, the supreme 
art in conversation. Boswell's efforts are ap- 
preciated in the spirit of understanding 
vouchsafed him by later criticism. Instead of 
listing him, as Fanny Burney did, as "that 
biographical, anecdotical, memorandummer," 
Professor Tinker interprets Boswell very 
justly. The immortal diarist herself is al- 
most too summarily dealt with; and at the 
conclusion of the chapter, the critic mourns 
the presence in the Diary of so much self- 
praise, so much quotation of the agreeable 
things said to the blushing but quite appre- 
ciative Miss Burney. Why mourn over this 
trait in her more than over a similar trait in 
the great lexicographer? Is vanity a man's 
right ? 

Within the book is a mass of information 
gleaned from very extensive reading, but so 
effectively and so crisply condensed, so 
briskly phrased, that each re-reading will 
yield a reward. The author's individual ap- 
preciation of his subject gives vivid insight 
into that age which has a singular charm for 
our mad epoch, in which such things as polite 
conversation and long, fastidiously composed 
letters are genuine antiques. So also, are 
those staunch convictions of ponderous size. 
It is a pleasure, in these days when " open- 
mindedness'" is synonymous with vacuity, to 
read of people who were not only positive, but 
actually bigoted. What an enviable age it 
was! No automobiles, no electricity, no 
strikes, no Sunday papers, time for dignity, 
deliberation, reading, and thinking! They 
had a happiness, a content, we shall never 
know, except in retrospect through the 
charmed medium of the printed page.

One of the most interesting announcements that 
has come to us for several months is that of the 
forthcoming publication of a selection from the 
letters of William Morris. It is expected that the 
work will comprise two or three volumes, which 
will probably be published in uniform style witli 
the collected edition of Morris's works recently com- 
pleted under the editorship of his daughter, Miss 
Mav Morris.

DIPLOMACY AXD THE GREAT WAR.* 

Whoever desires to study the proximate 
causes of the mighty conflict in which Europe 
is now plunged will find a wealth of material 
in the official publications issued by the various 
belligerent governments since the outbreak of 
the war, the British and German AVhite 
Books, the Russian Orange Paper, the Bel- 
gian Gray Paper, the French Yellow Book, 
the Austrian Red Book, and the Servian Blue 
Book. The entry of other powers into the 
conflict will doubtless be followed by other 
similar publications. The promptness with 
which these documents were issued, and the 
somewhat lavish manner in which they have 
been circulated, are quite without precedent 
in the wars of the past, and can only be 
explained by the desire of the governments 
concerned to put their qases before the world 
in the hope of obtaining a favorable verdict 
upon their conduct. The whole procedure 
affords a striking illustration of the fact that 
civilized nations are not only not indifferent 
to the opinions of mankind, but that, on the 
contrary, they eagerly court the approbation 
of international public opinion for their acts, 
the good faith and rectitude of which are 
suspected. 

It is one of the happy results of the new 
diplomacy and of government by public opin- 
ion that important diplomatic correspondence 
which in former times would have been care- 
fully concealed in the archives of foreign 
offices for generations, is to-day made public 
almost as soon as it is dispatched; so that it 
is possible to write the history of the events 
with which it deals before that history be- 
comes ancient. With the aid of the published 
diplomatic documents which the present war 
has produced, it is possible for contemporary 
historians to determine and fix the responsi- 
bility for the war which is now ruining 
Europe, while those upon whom the responsi- 
bility rests are still living. 

The task of examining this large mass of 
diplomatic material, and of unravelling the 
tangled skein of a multiplicity of notes, has 
been greatly simplified by the work of Pro- 
fessor Stowell of Columbia University, who 
has made a systematic digest and critical 
analysis of these documents, and has so ar- 
ranged and coordinated the results that it is 
now possible for one to get the gist of it all 
without the necessity of reading the various 
documents in their entirety. If, for example, 
one desires to study the question of the viola-

versity. Volume I., The Beginnings of the War. Boston:

tion of the neutrality of Belgium, he will find 
in a single chapter a critical analysis of all the 
important diplomatic documents bearing on 
the subject, along with a historical introduc- 
tion by the author, followed by his own con- 
clusions regarding the responsibility for the 
act. In a similar manner, all the other impor- 
tant controversies are examined and judged. 

Recognizing, very properly, that an under- 
standing of the deep and underlying causes of 
the war is impossible without a knowledge 
of the history of the international relations of 
Europe during the years antedating the out- 
break of the conflict, the author starts out 
with a review of such important events as the 
founding of the Triple Alliance, the Triple 
Entente, the Dual Alliance, the Conference of 
Algeciras, the Agadir and Casablanca inci- 
cents, and the Turco-Italian and Balkan 
wars. With this survey as a necessary back- 
ground, he proceeds to examine in succession 
the diplomatic correspondence relating to the 
controversy between Austria and Servia, be- 
tween Austria and Russia, between Germany 
and Russia, between England and the powers 
concerned, that relating to the neutrality of 
Belgium, and so on. 

A large part of the work consists of impor- 
tant extracts from the diplomatic documents, 
so arranged and analyzed as to give it the 
character of a narrative. It is not, therefore, 
a mere compilation or collection of documents. 
There is much comment by the author, and, 
very properly, he has exercised freely his 
right to judge the facts in the light of the 
evidence, and to condemn where, in his opin- 
ion, condemnation is justifiable. On the 
whole, however, his judgments are fair and 
dispassionate; and being based upon a very 
thorough and detailed examination of the 
official documents, they must carry great 
weight. It is not difficult for an impartial 
observer who studies these documents with the 
aid of Professor Stowell's analysis and com- 
ment to make up his mind as to where the 
responsibility for this war properly belongs. 

We may now summarize some of the au- 
thor's more important conclusions. Regard- 
ing the merits of the controversy between 
Austria and Servia a controversy which 
was the occasion if not the cause of the gen- 
eral conflict Professor Stowell concludes 
from his study of the diplomatic documents 
that Servia " evinced a most conciliatory 
spirit," and that she went as far toward meet- 
ing the Austrian demands as was possible for 
the government of any independent state to 
go. "If Austria," he says, "because of her 
peculiarly perilous situation, considered it 
impossible to discuss the question [of media- 



108 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



tion] and to examine whether the proposed 
guarantees would not be adequate, we must 
conclude her action to be a confession that she 
was herself unable to live up to her interna- 
tional obligations." Russia's conduct as the 
protector of Servia was not reprehensible. 
She employed "all her efforts to obtain a 
pacific issue which would be acceptable to 
Austria and satisfy her amour-propre." Con- 
cerning the question as to whether the Ger- 
man government knew the contents of the 
Austrian ultimatum before it was dispatched 
to the Servian government, Professor Stowell 
expresses the opinion that while the text of 
the note may not have been communicated to 
the German government, it seems likely that 
it was shown to the German ambassador at 
Vienna, who doubtless informed the German 
government of its contents. In any case, the 
German government took particular pains to 
be in a position where it could proclaim its 
ignorance of the note, in order to be able to 
say to the other powers that it had kept out 
of the affair and had exercised no influence 
upon Austria in formulating her demands 
upon Servia. 

Professor Stowell reviews at length the 
efforts of Sir Edward Grey to prevent a gen- 
eral war, and how they were destined to fail. 
No one can read the mass of correspondence in 
all these official publications without feeling 
that Sir Edward stands out as the most ad- 
mirable figure among all the diplomats and 
foreign ministers concerned. He worked tire- 
lessly and almost without ceasing to preserve 
peace, and he seems never to have despaired 
until all hope was gone. 

Coming to the much discussed question of 
the violation of the neutrality of Belgium, 
Professor Stowell examines, first, the German 
contention that the neutralization treaty of 
1839 was not binding in 1914, and on every 
point he refutes the German argument com- 
pletely. This treaty, he says, was not only 
binding on all the signatory parties, but they 
were under an obligation to cooperate in 
guaranteeing the neutrality proclaimed by 
the treaty. More than this, "it was a duty 
which all the states of the world owe to inter- 
national law to take every reasonable and 
practical means to prevent Germany from 
effecting such a gross violation of the rights 
of a weak state as has resulted from her inva- 
sion." This obligation, he asserts, rested upon 
the United States equally with the other 
powers. There is, of course, a difference of 
opinion as to the merits of this view ; but un- 
questionably if international law means what 
it has heretofore been understood to mean, 



strong argument can be advanced in favor of 
the position of the author. 

Considering in turn the various German 
excuses for violating the neutrality of Bel- 
gium, that England intended to land troops 
there for the purpose of attacking Germany, 
that there existed a convention between Bel- 
gium and England by .which they were to 
make common cause against Germany, that 
there was a similar agreement between Bel- 
gium and France, that documents discovered 
in Brussels showed that Belgium had violated 
her neutral obligations, etc., Professor Stow- 
ell finds no evidence to support the German 
contention on any of these points. His thor- 
ough and critical analysis of the documents, 
and the evidence which he marshals in sup- 
port of his conclusions, will go far toward 
convincing impartial observers of the correct- 
ness of his findings. Germany's conduct is 
criticized severely. The invasion of Belgium, 
he remarks, has been compared to the case of 
a man who is guilty of a trespass in crossing 
his neighbor's premises to escape from a fire ; 
but it would be fairer to compare it to the 
case of a man who does not wait to meet his 
adversary in a fair fight, but tries to reach 
him by shooting through the walls of an inter- 
vening house without regard to the lives of the 
helpless inmates. 

In a final chapter the author sums up his 
conclusions, and attempts to fix the chief 
responsibility for the war. This responsibil- 
ity falls mainly on the shoulders of Germany. 

" Germany has clearly violated international 
law, and, if she does not succeed, even for the 
moment, in escaping punishment, the lesson will be 
as salutary as the example of Bismarck was delete- 
rious. Meanwhile, the manner in which she has 
held the rest of Europe in check compels the 
admiration of all beholders. . . Should Germany 
be successful in carrying out the theories of her 
Government, and her people, after the war-enthusi- 
asm is past, continue to support the Government, 
which has put through its projects in disregard of 
its treaty obligations and of the peaceful existence 
of the individuals composing another nation, the 
student of events, seeking with impartial view, will 
have to admit that we are not yet ready for any 
great step forward ; that it is too early to recognize 
the practical existence of the society of humanity 
as such, including all peoples."

A PRAGMATIC ILLUMINATION OF 
EDUCATION.* 



Divine philosophy has not always been hap- 
pily united with pedagogical theory. Not 
infrequently " educators " have but a superfi- 
cial philosophy; while it must be admitted 
that there are philosophers who know little of 
the art of teaching. A great shout of wel- 
come should therefore go up when a profound 
thinker sets himself the task of a practical 
exposition of the most practical, as it is the 
most important, art in life, the art of 
education. Properly enough, a pragmatic 
philosopher, Professor John Dewey, now of 
Columbia University, has accomplished this 
work ; and so for once etymology is justified 
of her children. 

Professor Dewey and his daughter, Miss 
Evelyn Dewey (who collected much of the 
material), disclaim intent at a system or a 
text-book. Quoting the preface : 

" We have tried to show what actually happens 
when schools start out to put into practice, each in 
its own way, some of the theories that have been 
pointed to as the soundest and best ever since 
Plato, to be then laid politely away as precious 
portions of our ' intellectual heritage ' . . . We 
have hoped to suggest to the reader the practical 
meaning of some of the more widely recognized 
and accepted views of educational reformers by 
showing what happens when a teacher applies 
these views." 

Notwithstanding the fact that this rather 
humble statement is an accurate description 
of the plan of the book, the ripe scholarship, 
the scrupulous soundness of the logic, and the 
art shown in presenting and massing the con- 
crete in a bath of luminous and consistent 
theory make of " Schools of To-morrow " a 
contribution of great importance. 

Professor Dewey 's thesis is based frankly 
upon Rousseau's " Emile." The first chapter, 
"Education as Development," is but a tren- 
chant exposition of Rousseau's epoch-making 
views. " We know nothing of childhood, and 
with our mistaken notions of it the further we 
go in education the more we go astray." Edu- 
cation must be " based upon the native capaci- 
ties of those to be taught and upon the need 
of studying children in order to discover what 
these native powers are." " Try to teach a 
child what is of use to him as a child, and you 
will find that it takes all his time." "The 
greatest, the most important, the most useful 
rule of education is: Do not save time, but 
lose it." "A child ill-taught is further from 
excellence than a child who has learned noth- 
ing at all." Teach a child what he has an

York : E. P. Dutton & Co. 



interest in, when he is interested in it. Do not 
anticipate the needs of adult life. Education 
is the development of power, not the acquisi- 
tion of information. 

All this has become the commonplace, even 
the semi-dangerous commonplace, of higher 
education in colleges and universities, screen- 
ing oftentimes hazy and slovenly ideas. But 
rightly interpreted, it is of immense impor- 
tance; and the welcome news derived from 
" Schools of To-morrow " is that whereas 
there is in the schools of to-day an absolute 
line of cleavage between the elementary and 
higher institutions in this respect, the ele- 
mentary schools insisting on a fund of adult 
information while the higher schools bemoan 
the lack of intellectual power displayed by 
their product, the "schools of to-morrow" 
are insisting on the same rational basis for 
elementary instruction. Education, instead 
of following a silly calf trail for sixteen or 
eighteen years and then attempting to insti- 
tute radical reform when mental habits are 
fixed, is on the threshold of a simple and abso- 
lute reform, the process of starting right, 
and by natural methods developing the whole 
life of the child. 

Place of honor among the laboratory cases 
cited is given to Mrs. Johnson's school at Fair- 
hope, Alabama, which seems to follow closely 
Rousseau's ideal. Professor Dewey thinks 
that Fairhope "has demonstrated that it is 
possible for children to lead the same natural 
lives in school that they lead in good homes 
outside of school hours; to progress bodily, 
mentally, and morally in school without facti- 
tious pressure, rewards, examinations, grades 
or promotions, while they acquire sufficient 
control of the conventional tools of learning 
and of study of books reading, writing, and 
figuring to be able to use them indepen- 
dently." Professor J. L. Meriam, Director of 
the Elementary School in the University of 
Missouri, bases his plan upon the four factors 
in the child's life: play, stories, observation, 
and handiwork. As the children grow older 
their interest is naturally drawn, as they dis- 
cover their ignorance, to history, geography, 
and science. Grammar and English are not 
taught as such, but incidentally in connection 
with all their work. Investigation of local 
topography, industries, and general condi- 
tions is emphasized here, as in other 
" reform " schools. The value of Acting out 
the stories of mythology and history is another 
generally recognized principle. That the 
school can fit smoothly into local needs and 
exercise great influence as a social settlement 
is shown by the success of Mr. Valentine's 
work in School 26 of Indianapolis. The prac- 



110 



THE DIAL 



[August 15 



tical work of this school has put new heart 
and vigor into a destitute and backward com- 
munity, and has gone far to solve the race 
problem. Here, and in many other schools 
cited, the object is immediate ends, not giv- 
ing the pupils the notion that they are getting 
ready to live, but actually living. This will 
seem to many, no doubt, a backward step, a 
tacit acceptance of Browning's low man who, 
aiming at a unit, soon hits his hundred, but 
always fails of the thousand. One of the 
facts cited, that the boys show more interest 
in the cooking lessons than girls, is a rather 
bizarre proof of the appeal of immediate ends. 
Yet there can be little doubt that the general 
movement is wise. Education should begin at 
the feet, we must learn to hit the units. 
That is of the most importance to the most 
people. Indeed, it is of prime importance to 
all, and will later enable the few to hit the 
thousand with all the greater accuracy. 

Here and there throughout the book, as in 
the final chapter on " Democracy and Educa- 
tion," the author exhibits something of the 
special pleader, or possibly it is only a too 
common academic blindness to the reality of 
grinding poverty in the world. " It is a com- 
monplace among teachers and workers who 
come in contact with any number of pupils 
who leave school at fourteen to go to work, 
that the reason is not so much financial pres- 
sure as it is lack of conviction that school is 
doing them any good." This is no doubt true 
in many communities, where the well-to-do 
class predominates. It must be of these that 
Professor Dewey is thinking ; for in all proba- 
bility he knows of the investigations of a 
former student of his in the Stock Yards dis- 
trict of Chicago, which revealed an altogether 
different state of affairs.* 

Professor Dewey's analysis of the much 
discussed Montessori method should be of 
value to those whose knowledge depends 
mainly upon periodical-skimming. While ap- 
proving of the freedom of action which 
Madame Montessori in common with most re- 
formers allows her pupils, he points out that 
her insistence on the use of her " didactic 
material " leaves their freedom restricted and 
of questionable importance. 

" There is no freedom allowed the child to create. 
He is free to choose which apparatus he will use, 
but never to choose his own ends, never to bend a 
material to his own plans. There is no doubt that 
backward children derive profit from the ' didactic 
material,' but after all it appears that various 
American reformers have learned how systemati- 
cally to educe power, creativeness, in the normal

child by permitting him to range freely over his 
material and adapt it to his own ends." 

This word "freedom" is the shibboleth of 
the schools of to-morrow. A year or so ago, 
Mr. Edmond Holmes, in his little book enti- 
tled "The Tragedy of Education," wrote much 
on this subject to very good purpose. It is 
wholly right for a child " to find the necessity 
in things, not in the caprices of man." to 
feel the curb of conditions, not of authority. 
And Professor Dewey does well to point out 
that " no discipline could be more severe, more 
apt to develop character and reasonableness, 
nor less apt to develop disorder and laziness " 
than the discipline which is self-taught and 
self-imposed. The only weakness in practi- 
cal results, a weakness that neither he nor 
Mr. Holmes nor Mrs. Johnson nor Mr. Wirt 
nor Mr. Valentine nor Professor Meriam nor 
Rousseau is aware of, is the difficulty of get- 
ting teachers wise enough to administer free- 
dom of this sort. Here and there is a genius 
who knows how; but these geniuses, sadly 
enough, do not impart their genius. An ordi- 
nary person can learn how to get results by 
following rules, but it must be an extraor- 
dinary person who gets results without rules. 
In its philosophy, its literature, its religion, 
humanity has so far always proceeded by rule 
and line ; only the geniuses have from time to 
time made new rules and struck off new lines. 
And after each epochal genius, when the plod- 
ding student-teacher follows the master, the 
method becomes again stereotyped. 

Professor Dewey sees clearly the Scylla of 
the old and the Charybdis of the new : 

" The problem of educational readjustment thus 
has to steer between the extremes of an inherited 
bookish education and a narrow, so-called prac- 
tical, education. It is comparatively easy to clamor 
for a retention of traditional materials and meth- 
ods on the ground that they alone are liberal and 
cultural. It is comparatively easy to urge the addi- 
tion of narrow, vocational training for those who, 
it is assumed, are to be the drawers of water and 
the hewers of wood in the existing economic 
regime, leaving intact the present bookish type of 
education for those fortunate enough not to have 
to engage in manual labor in the home, shop, or 
farm. But since the real question is one of or- 
ganization of all education to meet the changed 
conditions of life scientific, social, political ac- 
companying the revolution in industry, the experi- 
ments which have been made with this wider end in 
view are especially deserving of sympathetic recog- 
nition and intelligent examination." 

Some minor faults of style are to be found 
in the volume, such as frequently occur when 
a writer is thinking mainly of his matter. 
"Apt" is regularly used in the sense of 
"likely"; and the rather naive redundancy.

RECENT AMERICAN ONE-ACT PLAYS.* 



One of the interesting tendencies in recent 
drama is the rise in popularity of the one-act 
play. The Irish school, perhaps, deserves 
chief credit for showing the possibilities of 
the one-act form, especially in tragedy and in 
whimsical comedy. In America, Mr. Percy 
Mackaye was a pioneer in this field, and he 
has had many followers. The extent to which 
the one-act piece is now being cultivated sug- 
gests that it may come to rival even the short 
story in popular favor. 

Of the twenty-two one-act plays by Amer- 
ican writers considered in the present review, 
three have to do with the European war. The 
nineteen others are singularly free from the 
propagandist taint which infects so large a 
proportion of recent English and continental 
plays. Probably it may be said that there are 
three aims among which, or among combina- 
tions of which, a dramatist must choose. He 
may aim to represent characters in an action 
with impartial truthfulness, caring to give 
pleasure only or chiefly through the fidelity 
of his representation. Or he may aim to rep- 
resent characters so as to give pleasure 
through, appeals to humor, sentiment, or 
imagination, caring less for truth and reality. 
Or he may aim to represent characters so as to 
enforce a doctrine or lesson, subordinating 
both truth and pleasure to this end. A pure 
type of the first class may be found in Ben 
Jonson's "Bartholomew Fair"; of the sec- 
ond, in Shakespeare's romantic comedy; of

the third, in the mediaeval moralities and in 
some of the plays of Shaw and Brieux. The 
first two objects are the legitimate ideals of 
drama; when the third becomes dominant, 
the writer must expect to be regarded pri- 
marily as a preacher, not as a dramatist. It is 
encouraging to find so little of this preaching 
tendency in the recent representative Amer- 
ican plays. 

Two of the three war plays, " War Brides " 
and "Across the Border," on the whole justify 
their dramatic form. " War Brides " is an 
attack on war from the woman's point of view. 
It is a vigorous and timely protest against the 
insult to womanhood implied in the custom to 
which the title alludes. The heroine has been 
married some months before the war, and her 
husband is at the front. The story deals with 
her attempt to influence the girls in her vil- 
lage against war marriages, an attempt 
which brings her into conflict with the. au- 
thorities. Her indignation and horror at the 
cynical treatment of what she holds most 
sacred are raised to a tragic pitch by the news 
of her husband's death in battle. She is preg- 
nant; but rather than bear a child who may 
be sacrificed to " the good of the Empire," she 
commits suicide. She is not a character who 
interests us greatly ; she is primarily a mouth- 
piece for individualist and pacifist ideas ; but 
these ideas are vigorously expressed, and are 
vitally related to the dramatic situation. The 
play is a good example of the effective use of 
drama for propagandist purposes. 

"Across the Border" bases its protest 
against war on more broadly human grounds ; 
partly, perhaps, for this reason it is a much 
better play. It is better, too, because the 
author is really interested in her hero as a 
person. The play makes skilful use of the 
now familiar device of a dream. Desperately 
wounded in an attempt to bring rescue to 
beleaguered comrades, the Junior Lieutenant 
in his delirious dream crosses-" the border " of 
death. What he sees there convinces him of 
the shameful cruelty and wrong of the whole 
system and ideal of war, and he begs for leave 
to return and try to make some of his com- 
rades understand. In the final scene in the 
improvised hospital he struggles to his gallant 
and pitiful failure. Written plainly, without 
declamation or sentimentality, the play makes 
a powerful and genuinely dramatic appeal. 

In Mr. Hagedorn's " Makers of v Madness," 
on the other hand, the doctrine completely 
crowds out the dramatic element. The com- 
position is not a play at all; it is an attempt 
to show through dialogue how war might be 
forced on the United States and an empire 
(clearly Germany) by the selfish interests of

militarists, politicians, and manufacturers of 
arms. There is a scene in the capital of each 
country, and then an impressionistic glimpse 
of a battle-field. A pamphlet may be more 
readable if cast in the form of dialogue, but 
the title-page should not call it a play. 

In his latest volume, Mr. George Middleton 
gives us some nearly perfect examples of our 
first-mentioned class of plays, those which 
aim above all at impartial truthfulness. The 
action in these little dramas is mostly psycho- 
logical, or shall we say? spiritual. The 
very impartiality of Mr. Middleton's attitude 
toward conventional morality has brought 
upon him the accusation of writing his plays 
to prove something; but the charge is an 
unfair one. He presents no theses; he tries 
merely to depict his people and their problems 
with delicate and intimate accuracy. Placed 
in a given situation, how will each character 
in a small group conduct himself? A young 
woman who has married to escape the frigid- 
ity of a loveless home finds that she cannot 
live in peace with her worthless and unfaith- 
ful husband. So, taking her child, she returns 
one evening to her father and mother, peo- 
ple who, without love, have kept up a respecta- 
ble appearance. How will the characters 
speak and act in this first interview ? This is 
the problem of " Circles." " The Groove " is 
simply a bedtime talk between two sisters, of 
whom the elder has stayed at home to take 
care of an invalid mother, and the younger 
has just returned from college. Each has a 
plan to confide to the other, but the plans are 
hopelessly in conflict. How will the situation 
develop ? It is obvious that plays of this sort 
would require the most finished and intelli- 
gent acting if they were to have any success 
on the stage; and even with this, the success 
of some of them would be doubtful. Mr. 
Middleton's characters are drawn admirably, 
but with an impartiality critical rather than 
sympathetic. His attitude toward them is too 
much that of an entomologist toward his 
specimens; his curiosity is too largely intel- 
lectual. He not only lacks sympathy, but, as 
might be expected, he lacks humor; this is 
especially noticeable in " The Black Tie," and 
also in " The Unborn," where the perspective 
is at times curiously distorted. By all odds 
the best of the plays is "A Good Woman"; 
with this possible exception, Mr. Middleton, 
conscientious and skilful artist as he is, leaves 
us a little cold. 

Much less mature and finished are the plays 
in Mr. Percival Wilde's collection. Mr. Wilde 
seems to be experimenting in various direc- 
tions. As yet he cares too little for truth to 
life, and he lacks a sure sense for stage effect. 



In "A House of Cards" he uses somewhat 
clumsily the dangerous device of misleading 
the audience. " Playing with Fire " is a 
rather sophomoric study of " calf love." "The 
Traitor " is based on an oddly false notion of 
human nature, the notion that a traitor may 
infallibly be detected by his zeal in urging 
mercy for another supposed traitor. The 
other pieces, however, show decided promise; 
and the best of them, "Dawn," is a really 
strong and brilliant little study in heroism. 
Here and there in Mr. Wilde's work one feels 
the influence of Mr. Mackaye. 

The four paper-bound plays by Mr. Ken- 
neth Sawyer Goodman show a keen sense of 
stage values and a considerable range. They 
would probably act better than the plays of 
either Mr. Middleton or Mr. Wilde. Some of 
them, indeed, have been acted, though with 
what success I do not know. They seem 
especially well adapted to amateur produc- 
tion ; the settings are simple, the action is 
rapid, and the parts make no heavy demand 
upon the actors. "Back of the Yards" is a 
strong and realistic little drama of tenement- 
house life in Chicago, dealing with the turn- 
ing point in a street boy's career. " The Game 
of Chess" is a cleverly constructed and stir- 
ring melodrama in miniature, presenting a 
nihilist's attempt on the life of a Czar. 
"Ephraim and the Winged Bear" is a sort 
of fantastic morality, amusing but a trifle too 
grotesque for complete success. " Barbara " 
is apparently an attempt to burlesque Mr. 
Bernard Shaw, an ambitious and tolerably 
rash undertaking. The fact is that Mr. Shaw, 
having reached the limit of extravagance pos- 
sible to sanity, can twiddle his fingers at the 
parodists. Mr. Goodman's terrible young per- 
son seems scarcely more than a faint copy of 
a Shaw heroine, and his valet deus ex machina 
a rather wooden imitation of the omniscient 
Shavian waiter. 

In contrast with Mr. Goodman's high spir- 
its and exuberant cleverness is the tone of 
simple and quiet sincerity of the "Wisconsin 
Plays." Miss Gale's "The Neighbors" is a 
charming little study of life in a small village. 
It is reported that Mis' Ellsworth, who, with 
her husband's scanty pension, has a hard time 
making ends meet, has had a telegram an- 
nouncing that her orphaned nephew of seven 
is coming to live with her. All the neighbors 
join forces to get up a "shower" surprise 
party for her. When preparations are nearly 
completed. Mis' Ellsworth appears at Mis' 
Abel's with another telegram saying that 
after all the little boy is to be adopted by an 
uncle. In this simple plot are introduced a 
number of delightful people, admirably char-

acterized. Who can forget " Grandma," for 
instance, with her experienced wisdom and 
her rebellion against carpet rags? Mr. Dick- 
inson's "In Hospital" is a severely realistic 
sketch of the human aspects of a serious 
operation. Though scarcely dramatic at all 
in the narrower sense of the word, in the 
hands of a great actor it would be immensely 
effective. Mr. Leonard's " Glory of the 
Morning" is pitched on a distinctly lower 
level. The heroine, for whom the play is 
named, is the Winnebago squaw of a French 
fur-trader ; the latter turns out to be a noble- 
man in exile, who wishes to take their chil- 
dren back with him to France. For some 
reason the American Indian makes intracta- 
ble material for drama. I cannot recall a 
single good dramatic presentation of him in 
his native state. In the present case, part of 
the difficulty is that the story calls for a more 
poetic and imaginative treatment than the 
author has given it. 

Altogether, in achievement as well as in 
promise, this is a notable group of plays. Ten 
years ago it could not have been matched by 
any selection of one-act pieces written in 
America. It looks as if we were going to see 
in this generation a really American drama.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



A life of 

prodigious 

achievement. 



As bluff John Hunter, the 
famous surgeon, anatomist, and 
physiologist, once said, " no man 
that wanted to be a great man ever was a 
great man." A fine example of true greatness 
and entire freedom from any desire for great- 
ness in the world's eyes may be found in the 
late Director of the New York Public Library, 
who came to that office, with its arduous work 
of construction and organization, after hav- 
ing virtually created the Johns Hopkins Hos- 
pital in Baltimore, the Surgeon-General's 
Library and its justly celebrated catalogue in 
Washington, and the laboratory of hygiene 
for the University of Pennsylvania in Phila- 
delphia, not to mention earlier and perhaps 
more heroic though less widely known 
achievements elsewhere. These various ser- 
vices to science and to humanity are now care- 
fully recorded, with much else of a more 
intimately biographical character, by his 
friend and co-worker in medicine, Dr. Fielding 
H. Garrison, in a substantial octavo volume 
entitled "John Shaw Billings: A Memoir" 
(Putnam). Of good New England stock, but 
of Hoosier birth and early training, Billings 
was forced to work his way through the suc- 



cessive stages of his academic and medical 
education, and the fact that he had to fight 
out one winter of this Spartan experience on 
seventy-five cents a week may help to explain, 
now that we have the details of his life before 
us, the hitherto unsuspected battles that he 
was compelled to wage with bodily infirmities 
during the greater part of his maturity. 
Eight times he underwent surgical operations, 
chiefly of a critical nature, and always except 
the last time he kept secret from his family 
the cause of these "short vacations," as he 
lightly styled them. Therefore the record 
of his eminent and varied services to his 
fellow-men, impressive though it had seemed 
before, gains immeasurably in significance 
when one learns, from Dr. Garrison's faithful 
presentation of Billings's life-struggle, the 
various handicaps and disabilities under 
which those brilliantly distinguished services 
were rendered. The customary equipment of 
illustrations, bibliography, genealogy, and 
index is not wanting to this carefully prepared 
biography, which, let it be added, has been 
made, as far as possible, autobiographical in 
character by the frequent insertion of pas- 
sages from Dr. Billings's writings, including 
a fragment of veritable autobiography. 

, , . In "A German- American's Con- 

The apologia . 

of a, German- feSSlOU of Faith (Huebsch), 

Professor Kuno Francke of 
Harvard has brought together five articles 
and three poems already published in various 
newspapers and periodicals. Among the arti- 
cles is the now famous open letter to Con- 
gressman Bartholdt on "Neutrality," which 
brings out clearly the difference between the 
author's undiluted Americanism and the 
rabid Teutonism of Messrs. Ridder, Viereck, 
and their congeners. In this connection, it 
is interesting to note the writer's statement 
that the letter was refused publication by the 
New York " Staats-Zeitung." For his mod- 
eration and tolerance, and his observance of 
the amenities during controversy, Professor 
Francke deserves commendation above other 
German -American apologists, and one is glad 
to think that he is the spokesman for many 
silent and thoughtful Americans of Teutonic 
descent who do not approve of the vocifer- 
ous propaganda undertaken by their self- 
appointed leaders. Yet Professor Francke is 
very far from being a Carl Schurz: The lat- 
ter was the product of Germany's noblest 
political idealism, the revolutionary move- 
ment of 1848; Professor Francke has been 
bred under the star of Hohenzollern imperial- 
ism, and like most Germans of the profes- 
sorial class is destitute of what we somewhat

ambiguously call " political sense." His ideal 
of government is a benevolent despotism in 
which the ills of the people are healed with 
paternal care. Germany's cause, as he sees it, 
is just, not because her manner of starting the 
war or her conduct in Belgium is justifiable 
(these are matters about which the author is 
significantly silent), but because "Germany 
to-day is the best governed country in the 
world." Here "best" plainly means "most 
efficiently." That the gap between this sort 
of political thinking and the ideals of Amer- 
ican democracy is too wide to be bridged over 
by a few occasional pamphlets must surely be 
evident to Professor Francke's lucid and re- 
flective mind. 

Mr. H. Addington Bruce is the 

%*&*. ^ iGr of the " Mind and Health 
Series" (Little, Brown, & Co.) 
of which three numbers have appeared. The 
first is by Dr. James J. Putnam, and deals 
with " Human Motives." It is a well chosen 
theme, and is presented with a quiet dignity 
and earnest purpose that is consoling when not 
convincing. Dr. Putnam finds two sources of 
motives, one in the mental and genetic 
series of impulses to which we are all subject, 
and the other in the philosophical or religious 
inculcation, whence comes the support of 
ideals. The two, in his opinion, have an equal 
authenticity and an equal value. The theme, 
though attractively set forth, tends to merge 
into vagueness and lose the substantial 
groundwork that one looks for in a physi- 
cian's outlook. The residue of good counsel 
justifies the essay. In the second volume of 
the series, Dr. Isador H. Coriat writes of 
" The Meaning of Dreams," finding that mean- 
ing in the Freudian notion of repressed wishes 
reconstructed by the dream motives of dis- 
guise and indirect expression. He sets forth 
the principle of interpretation, and adds a 
number of instances of dreams thus inter- 
preted (largely in relation to sex desires and 
symbolisms) from his own records. Thus 
summarized and stated in loose order, they 
seem utterly unconvincing, and verge upon 
the strained logical contortions which Baco- 
nian " provers " of their Shakespearean posi- 
tions have made familiar. It scarcely seems 
probable that the popularization of this move- 
ment by evidence thus inviting misconception 
on the part of the lay reader, serves any useful 
purpose. The third volume is by the editor of 
the series, and bears the title, " Sleep and 
Sleeplessness," --though the longest chapter 
in the book deals with the somewhat irrelevant 
theme of "Dreams and the Supernatural." 
The volume is distinctly uncritical, and re- 



peats the exploded " Caspar Hauser " myth as 
real evidence, while the view of premonitory 
dreams is hardly standard. The practical 
counsel offered by Mr. Bruce in regard to 
sleep and sleeplessness is sound and well put. 

A brief account The twentieth volume in the

Appomattox. , JJ/T i. \ T L -i .L 

raphies (Jacobs) is devoted to 
the soldier who saved the nation in the crisis 
of our Civil- War. Mr. Franklin Spencer 
Edmonds is the author, and his book appro- 
priately gives considerably more than half of 
its substance to Grant's services in the field 
from 1861 to 1865. Almost innumerable, as 
the writer admits, are the accounts we already 
have of the memorable deeds of this great 
military commander; but the lesson of his 
life will bear repeated interpretation with the 
passage of the years. Also, the publication in 
recent times of memoirs and letters by various 
friends and contemporaries of General Grant 
m&kes possible to-day a fuller and truer 
account of the man than ever before. Com- 
paratively recent are, for example, the au- 
tobiographic and reminiscent writings of 
Generals Howard and James Harrison Wilson 
and Morris Schaff and Carl Schurz, the pub- 
lication of Gideon Welles's diary, and the 
issue of General Meade's "Life and Letters." 
In his bibliography of important aids to the 
study of Grant's life, Mr. Edmonds makes no 
mention of the Howard autobiography, one 
of the most valuable and interesting of the 
military memoirs relating to our great con- 
flict and its principal commanders; but he 
does quote some words of Howard's illustra- 
tive of Grant's methods as a soldier. Within 
the modest compass allowed him, the author 
has produced a handy and readable history of 
his hero, and one that bears evidences of more 
than perfunctory preliminary study. The 
frontispiece shows Grant as he looked at 
Appomattox, in the month of April, 1865. 
A useful chronological table precedes the 
reading matter, and certain official docu- 
ments of relevant import follow it. 



Problems of

Although Miss Frances A. Kel-

book " Out of Work " (Putnam) 
is other than a revision of her earlier work 
bearing the same title, the scope and content 
of the present book show little 'resemblance 
to those of the former edition. Unemploy- 
ment continues to be our most difficult and 
perplexing social problem. No one can claim 
to have found a solution for this standing 
reproach to our modern industrial system. 
Yet it is some satisfaction to know that in

America as elsewhere the eleven years which 
have elapsed since the first edition of Miss 
Kellor's book appeared have borne some fruit 
in thoughtful attention to and hopeful plans 
for combatting the evil of enforced idleness. 
Such subjects as regular ization of employ- 
ment, dovetailing of industries, unemploy- 
ment insurance, and vocational guidance, 
methods which are now the most urged by 
reformers for lessening unemployment or re- 
lieving it from its most serious consequences, 
were not discussed a decade ago. Miss Kel- 
lor's earlier work was devoted entirely to a 
study of employment agencies and intelli- 
gence offices. Considerable improvement in 
the work of the public agencies and better 
regulation of the private offices have taken 
place since then ; but much remains to be 
done before these agencies for the distribu- 
tion of labor are in a condition to render 
adequate service. Miss Kellor believes that 
the most hopeful development of this side of 
the work lies in the establishment of munici- 
pal employment bureaus cooperating with 
Federal agencies for the distribution of labor. 
She also urges an intensive study of the 
extent and causes of unemployment in every 
locality, and of the possibilities of increasing 
employment. The better organization of pri- 
vate industries with the purpose in view of 
reducing the long periods of idleness now 
found in the seasonal trades, and the planning 
of government work with a view to its per- 
formance in dull times, more intelligent direc- 
tion of children in industry, and cautious 
experiments in the way of insurance against 
unemployment are the other more important 
features in the programme for America 
suggested in the closing chapter of the book. 

If proof is wanted that the first 

autobiography. 6ssential to success in the world 
is self-confidence, one need but 
turn to Sir Hiram S. Maxim's breezy relation 
of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to 
fame and fortune. From his first invention, 
a remarkably efficient mouse-trap, to his 
latest triumphs in smokeless powder and auto- 
matic guns, he has shown himself a man of 
endless resource, in shrewdness and capabil- 
ity and ingenuity entirely worthy of his 
Yankee birth and breeding. There is some- 
thing splendid in his well-grounded faith in 
his own powers. Whether it was a wild bull 
to be subdued with bare hands, or a village 
bully to be laid low, or some inventive " stunt " 
to perform in mechanics, chemistry, elec- 
tricity, or the fashioning of lethal weapons, 
he was always equal to the occasion ; and his 
manner of recounting these triumphs is as 



characteristic as his mode of achieving them. 
A certain primitive openness, directness, 
forcefulness, speaks in his pages. He writes 
exactly as a large and strong man who has 
done notable things in the world of matter 
and force ought to write; and he shows a 
memory for details, an ability to marshal his 
facts impressively and sometimes pictur- 
esquely, that one finds highly enjoyable. As 
an illustration of the versatility of his genius, 
let it be noted that Sir Hiram has invented an 
inhaler for the cure of bronchitis, of which, 
he says, " large numbers are now being sold 
all over the world." What wonder that, after 
fashioning so many instruments for the 
slaughter of his fellow-men, he takes pride in 
this device for saving their lives? The book, 
certainly one of the best of its kind, and bear- 
ing the short but sufficient title, "My Life" 
(McBride), is well illustrated and in other 
technical details worthy of its theme, the 
history of a man who has always hated care- 
less craftsmanship, 



A handbook 
on commission 
government. 



As an argument for commission 
government, Mr. Osw r ald Ryan's 
"Municipal Freedom," in the 
series called " The American Books " (Double- 
day), leaves little to be desired. As an 
attempt to weigh commission government 
carefully and discriminate between its advan- 
tages and its deficiencies, it is very far from 
satisfactory. All the benefits to be secured 
by this wiping out of the entire structure of 
the old city government the centralization 
of power and responsibility, the weakening of 
meaningless party lines, the emphasizing of 
honesty and efficiency are enumerated, with 
detailed reference to the experience of various 
cities. But the author does not tell us why, 
as yet, commission government has seldom 
proved a notable success except in cities of 
the third or fourth class in population. He 
does not show the justice of the theory that 
city government is almost purely a business 
institution, with few legislative functions, or 
demonstrate how the decisions of a small body 
of expert executives in questions of policy will 
satisfy the public as would those of a repre- 
sentative assembly. One extraordinary fea- 
ture is the chapter upon " The Coming of the 
Burgomaster," in which the author gives his 
hearty approval to the scheme for a city 
manager, apparently without fully realizing 
that in its essence it is very distinct from the 
commission form, while even the commis- 
sion-manager plan is a long step toward the 
view that municipal administration is an 
exact science rather than an opportunity for 
business knack. Much may indeed be hoped

from the innovations in city government ; but 
books such as this will scarcely convince us 
that it is not the infusing spirit, as opposed 
to the machinery, that counts for most. 



A romance of 
love and war 
in old India. 



" Tis good to be two-and-twenty, 
with a fine troop of light dra- 
goons at your back, a-setting out 
to seek your fortune, on a cool, brisk morning 
in an Indian spring. Eh, sirs ! To hack your 
way to power with your own sword arm and 
your own resources behind you, what finer 
champagne for the imagination? Half the 
troopers were lads, too, agog to have their day, 
full of confidence in the lad who sat at their 
head, with old Ganesha Singh at the helm for 
wisdom in the evil ways of an Eastern world." 
Add that it all befell in " the days of the Free- 
lance proper, the last decade of the eighteenth 
century," and that the central scene is laid in 
the beauteous vale of Kashmir. Then picture 
a glorious- visaged, sweet-hearted Afghan prin- 
cess, in whose company our hero learned that 
"the desire for female beauty is at best the 
desire for a compelling deity in whose service 
men may strike their best notes." After that 
prepare your ear for strange legends of Chris- 
tianity in this distant valley, and an echo of 
the "hundredth name of God" and the 
" omnific word." And if you will do all this, 
you may read a romance that will quicken 
your blood, and incidentally convey a very 
living conception of men's life and farings in 
a most picturesque land at a most stirring 
time. The story referred to, "A Freelance in 
Kashmir" (Longmans), is from the pen of 
Lieut.-Col. G. F. MacMunn, and is written in 
a style that is vigorous and forward-moving 
rather than scrupulously careful or highly 
polished. A few slips in the proofreading 
ought not to have been made; but they will 
probably be more irritating to conscientious 
reviewers than to anybody else. 



The unexplored immensity of 
Beckoning ^jg universe in which we live, 

its perennial freshness and won- 
derfulness, its endless multiplicity in unity, 
the fascination of its abiding mystery these 
qualities speak in Mr. Richard Le Gallienne's 
"Vanishing Roads, and Other Essays" (Put- 
nam), a collection of short prose studies and 
sketches reprinted from various magazines, 
whose editors the author thanks for their 
"discernment" in giving the pieces "their 
first opportunity with the reader." Discern- 
ing these editors unquestionably were, and one 
hopes that many additional readers will profit 
by the discernment of the publishing house 
which now issues the essays in book-form. Too 



well known to require notice at this late day 
are Mr. Le Gallienne's engaging qualities as a 
writer of prose, his sympathetic interpreta- 
tion of nature, his enthusiasm for the best in 
literature and art, the breadth of his view of 
things human and divine, the occasional stimu- 
lating audacities of his thought and style. 
Generous in his praise and unequivocal in his 
condemnation, he expresses his opinions with 
no cautious restraint. Of a certain gifted 
actor's rendering of the final scene in " Ham- 
let " he says : " I would not exchange any- 
thing I have ever read or seen for Forbes- 
Robertson as he sits there so still and starlit 
upon the throne of Denmark." And of mod- 
ern magazine editorship he writes with a 
plentitude of disapprobation that suggests no 
little experience (as a contributor) of that 
whereof he speaks. His picture of the nimble 
and sprightly old lady of eighty dancing the 
tango with him is most enjoyable. From the 
first of the book's twenty-nine chapters, the 
one that gives its name to the collection, let us 
quote, in closing, the concluding passage: 
"For a while the murmur of the running 
stream of Time shall be our fellow-wayfarer 
till, at last, up there against the sky-line, we 
too turn and wave our hands, and know for 
ourselves where the road wends as it goes to 
meet the stars. And others will stand as we 
to-day and watch us reach the top of the ridge 
and disappear, and wonder how it seemed to 
us to turn the radiant corner and vanish with 
the rest along the vanishing road." 



A manual of 
wild bird 
culture. 



The ever-increasing need of 
constructive efforts to conserve 
the remnant of the wild fowl 
and other native birds grows rapidly apace as 
agriculture progresses and the forests disap- 
pear, and especially as drainage, reclamation, 
and flood-control destroy the feeding and 
breeding grounds of the water birds. The 
difficulties of taming the wild fowl, though 
great, are not insuperable; and losses from 
disease among domesticated wild fowl, espe- 
cially quail and grouse, though depleting at 
times, may be avoided by proper preventive 
measures. These and many other practical 
matters of interest to the would-be cultivator 
of quail, grouse, pheasants, wild turkeys, 
partridges, pigeons, doves, and waterfowl 
generally are discussed in Mr. Herbert K. 
Job's "Propagation of Wild Birds" (Double- 
day), a manual of applied ornithology de- 
signed to assist the experimenter and the 
culturist. It is a constructive work, based on 
wide observation of and experience with the 
birds whose culture is advocated. Illustrations 
show details of equipment and procedure, and

delineate the success of well-directed effort. 
Attention is also given to the method and 
equipment useful in encouraging native song 
birds to make their homes in garden, field, 
and forest. "Winter feeding, nesting sites, 
nesting boxes, and water and food supply, 
are discussed, and methods of protection 
against and warfare on predatory enemies, 
not omitting the roaming house cat, are advo- 
cated. The book should do much to encourage 
the preservation of our native birds. 



secession an* Mr. Daniel Wait Howe's " Politi- 

slavery: an old Cal History of ScCCSSlOn (Put- 

nam) is chiefly valuable, perhaps, 
as a document revealing the mellowing effect 
of the passage of time upon partisan feeling. 
That a citizen of Indiana, born of a line of 
Massachusetts Puritans, and himself a soldier 
in the Union army, has been able to write, in 
his later years, a book so evidently disposed to 
fairness constitutes a basis for optimism as to 
the progress of historical scholarship in Amer- 
ica. One topic African Slavery is funda- 
mental to the work. Mr. Howe shows that he 
has control of the original materials, and of 
the monographic literature of late years. His 
estimate of John Brown is far different from 
the traditional Northern view ; and in connec- 
tion with his narrative of the Dred Scott deci- 
sion he has made use of the recently-published 
"Writings of James Buchanan." But while 
the topic of slavery is thus well documented 
and well developed, the emphasis upon this one 
subject is not in accord with the historical 
vision of to-day, which in the effort to account 
for the Civil War now insists upon an exam- 
ination of other elements, the influence of 
immigration and the diffusion of European 
race stocks, the development of the transcon- 
tinental railroads, and the like. Even as to 
negro slavery, the author has apparently left 
unexamined the writings of Mr. A. H. Stone 
and Mr. U. B. Phillips. Minor errors occur, 
such as the statement that Virginia ceded to 
the general government the territory now in- 
cluded in Kentucky (p. 10) , and the statement 
that Arkansas was admitted to the Union in 
1820 (p. 59). But notwithstanding such defi- 
ciencies as these, the work is a contribution to 
American history that was worth the doing. 



origins and Th< ? ballade & known almost 
development of entirely from two or three ex- 
amples, the most perfect being 
the exquisite "Mais ou sont les neiges d'an- 
tan " of Villon, and the next, not far removed, 
the beautiful "Truth, Balade de Bon Con- 
ceyl " of Chaucer. In its revival in the nine- 
teenth century, both in English and in 



French, it is "a poetic trifle, rarely concerned 
with the solemnities of life." It is of this 
form, largely an artificial product in France 
and an exotic in England, that Miss Helen 
Louise Cohen has written an exhaustive 
monograph for the "Studies in English and 
Comparative Literature of Columbia Uni- 
versity." The type took some four centuries 
to attain the rigidity of three stanzas and an 
envoy, and it lasted in France as form rather 
than as spirit for two centuries and a half 
more. Miss Cohen's treatise is from the na- 
ture of its subject not especially inspiring. 
It deals in some detail with the origins of the 
type from the Provengal balada and the bal- 
lette, and considers it during the years after 
the fourteenth century when it was a conven- 
tional form for expression of more or less 
barren thoughts on religion, death, the transi- 
toriness of existence (the "Ubi sunt" poems), 
courtly love, satire, and history. Consider- 
ably more attention is given to the ballade in 
Middle English in proportion to the fre- 
quency of its occurrence; in fact, Miss 
Cohen's work was begun as a study of the 
ballade in English. And yet with the excep- 
tion of Chaucer there is hardly anything in 
this period worthy of preservation. A final 
chapter takes up the ballade in the nineteenth 
century in France and England. The book 
contains a goodly number of ballades not 
hitherto printed, and full bibliographies. 



A little-known Dr - Hendrik Willem Van Loon's 
period in " Rise of the Dutch Kingdom"

tunate and little-known period between the 
flight of the Stadholder William V. before the 
soldiers of the French Republic in 1795 and 
the establishment of the constitutional mon- 
archy under his son as William I. in 1814. 
Numerous Americans who have heard Dr. Van 
Loon lecture will recognize in his written work 
the same qualities that make his spoken dis- 
course so entertaining, a crisp and per- 
spicuous style, light and easy movement, the 
presentation of essentials in clear relief, and a 
spicy humor. A month after he had finished a 
series of summer session lectures at the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, Dr. Van Loon was on 
Belgian soil, where, on Christmas night, 1914, 
he dedicates his work " to the five soldiers of 
the Belgian army who saved my life near 
Waerloos," hoping "that their grandchildren 
may read a story of national revival which will 
be as complete and happy as that of our own 
land." Let us trust the story they read will 
be as lively an interpretation of the Belgian 
eclipse by Germany as Dr. Van Loon's is of the 
temporary obscuration of Holland by France.

THE DIAL 



[August 15 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

A new edition, revised and enlarged, of George 
Palmer Putnam's " The World's Progress " has 
been continued to date under the editorial super- 
vision of the compiler's son, Mr. George Haven 
Putnam, and is published under the title, " Tabular 
Views of Universal History" (Putnam). The 
original scheme has been preserved of presenting, 
in parallel columns, a record of the most note- 
worthy events in the world's history, a scheme 
which adapts itself admirably to the needs of the 
student who wishes to memorize dates and events 
through the assistance of visual association. To 
this new edition is added an index an indis- 
pensable aid for quick reference to a volume of 
this kind. 

Two useful handbooks for those who conduct 
meetings under the rules of parliamentary law 
have recently been issued. The latest revision of 
"Robert's Rules of Order Revised" (Scott, Fores- 
man & Co.) contains nearly twice as much mate- 
rial as the last previous edition of this little vol- 
ume, which has practically been accepted as the 
standard manual on parliamentary points since its 
first publication in 1876. " Shattuck's Parliamen- 
tary Answers" (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co.) is 
" alphabetically arranged for all questions likely 
to arise in women's organizations." It is more 
informal than " Robert's Rules," and perhaps on 
that account may seem better adapted to the needs 
of the novice. 

In "American Women in Civic Work" (Dodd), 
Miss Helen Christine Bennett has described the 
careers of eleven living American women who 
have attained distinction in some branch of social 
work or civic service. Portions of the sketches 
were printed originally in some of the popular 
magazines, and the readable quality which ap- 
peared in them has been preserved. Of the 
women whose public service is described, the best 
known, perhaps, are Jane Addams, Anna Howard 
Shaw, Ella Flagg Young, Lucretia L. Blankenburg, 
Frances A. Kellor, and Annie Fellows Bacon. 
The sketches are highly appreciative, even lauda- 
tory; yet in no instances do they become extrava- 
gant. There should be inspiration in them for 
women everywhere. 

Teaching literature through emphasis on its 
human and personal aspects, through a study of 
the picturesque features of its background, and 
through an appeal to the dramatic instinct of the 
boy or girl of high-school age, has been the aim of 
Miss Maude Morrison Frank in the preparation of 
her little volume of five " Short Plays about 
Famous Authors" (Holt). The idea is novel and 
practical, and much helpful fun is in store for the 
pupils who decide under Miss Frank's guidance 
to impersonate Goldsmith entertaining Squire 
Featherston with school-boy swagger, Heine at 
twenty-one, Fanny Burney at Court, the family of 
the eleven-year-old Charles Dickens released from 
debt on Christmas Eve, or Shakespeare, in the 
fairies' realm defying Time himself with the aid of 
Titania and Puck. 



The views of Sir Oliver Lodge on " The War 
and After" will be published in book form at an 
early date. 

" Towards International Government " is the 
title of a new work by Mr. John A. Hobson, which 
will be published shortly. 

A new novel by Mr. Compton Mackenzie, author 
of " Carnival," etc., will be published in September 
under the title of " Guy and Pauline." 

Maxim Gorky's vivid autobiographic memoirs of 
his childhood and youth, now appearing in " The 
English Review," will be brought out in book form 
by the Century Co. 

" The Mask of Death," an autobiographical frag- 
ment by Gabriele D'Annunzio, has been translated 
with an introduction by Arundel del Re, and will 
be published before long in London. 

" The Admirable Painter : A Study of Leon- 
ardo da Vinci," by Mr. A. J. Anderson, based on 
the painter's notebooks, and illustrated with repro- 
ductions of his works, is soon to appear. 

Mrs. John Lane has in the press a companion 
volume to her sprightly book, "According to 
Maria," entitled " Maria Again." It will shortly 
be published in this country by the John Lane Co. 

"An American Garland," being a collection of 
ballads relating to America, 1563-1759, has been 
compiled and edited by Professor C. H. Firth, and 
will be published early in September by Mr. B. H. 
Blackwell of Oxford. 

" Sunset Balconies " is the title of a new volume 
of poems by Mr. Thomas Walsh his first since 
the appearance five years ago of " Prison Ships 
and Other Poems" which the Macmillan Co. 
plan to issue next month. 

The new novel of Irish life by George A. Bir- 
mingham, which will appear next month under the 
title of " Gossamer," is brought down to the world 
crisis in August last, and culminates in the effect 
on the lives and fortunes of its characters of the 
declaration of war. 

A coming addition to the books about the Kaiser 
will be Mr. Edward Legge's " The Public and 
Private Life of Wilhelm II.," to be published 
shortly. Mr. Legge is the author of biographies of 
King Edward VII. and the Empress Eugenie, both 
of which have won considerable attention. 

A book of personal reminiscences and impres- 
sions of Bronson Alcott and his family, by a friend 
of the famous transcendentalist, is announced in 
the volume of "Alcott Memoirs," compiled from 
the papers, journals, and memoranda of the late 
Dr. Frederick L. H. Willis. In a literary way, the 
book is likely to prove one of the most interesting 
of the autumn season. 

A new romance by Mr. Anthony Hope, entitled, 
"A Young Man's Year" the first novel to come 
from the author since the publication four years 
ago of " Mrs. Maxon Protests " is announced 
for autumn publication. The hero of "A Young 
Man's Year " is "Arthur Lisle, of the Middle

Temple, Esquire," and the story recounts his for- 
tunes and his doings, professional, speculative, and 
venturesome. 

Under the title of " The Superman in Modern 
Literature " there will shortly be published the 
translation of a work by Leo Berg, tracing the 
genesis of the superman idea far beyond the days 
of Nietzsche, through a great number of writers, 
many of them outside Germany, including Carlyle, 
Emerson, Kierkegaard, Flaubert, and Renan, 
showing how the superman idea has permeated the 
work of modern poets and novelists, especially in 
Germany. 

Undeterred by the storm of contumely brought 
down upon him by the publication of his " Common 
Sense about the War," Mr. Bernard Shaw is 
planning the early publication of a detailed discus- 
sion of the settlement that must follow the war. 
" I am the gravest public danger that confronts 
England," announced Mr. Shaw recently, " because 
I have the strange power of turning the nation pas- 
sionately away from the truth by the simple act of 
uttering it." 

Thomas Young Crowell, founder and for many 
years head of the publishing business now known as 
the Thomas Y. Crowell Co., died in Montclair, New 
Jersey, on July 29. Mr. Crowell was a prominent 
figure among the older school of American publish- 
ers. In the work of making the classics of literature 
available at a low price in well-produced form he 
was almost a pioneer in this country ; and on other 
accounts, also, his name deserves to be held in 
honored remembrance in the annals of American 
publishing. 

Some sidelights on the Franco-Prussian war and 
the establishment of the Third Republic are prom- 
ised in the " Memoirs of M. Thiers," to be pub- 
lished shortly. The book is compiled from personal 
papers, notes, memoranda, and other documents 
left by Thiers. A selection of these, dealing with 
the years 1870-1872, was edited by Thiers's sister- 
in-law and his former secretary, and printed in 
France for private circulation. The book has 
now been translated into English by Mr. F. M. 
Atkinson. 

Mr. Richard Whiteing's volume of reminiscences, 
to be called " My Harvest," will be published in the 
early autumn. It gives an account of Mr. White- 
ing's early life in London and of his first journal- 
istic efforts on the " Evening Star," with Justin 
McCarthy as editor, and William Black and Sir 
Edward Russell as his colleagues. Mr. Whiteing 
was a special correspondent in Paris during the 
closing years of the Second Empire, and his book 
has something to say about Taine, Flaubert, the 
younger Dumas, Octave Feuillet, and other French 
men of letters. 

Our readers will welcome the announcement that 
Mr. Edmund Gosse has at last finished his "Life 
of Swinburne," though the book will not be pub- 
lished until after the war. Another book now 
ready for the press is a collection of Swinburne's 
posthumous poems, edited by Mr. Gosse and 
Mr. Thomas J. Wise; while Mr. Gosse has also in 
preparation a selection from Swinburne's corre- 



spondence. Mr. Gosse has had at his disposal all 
the Houghton manuscripts, and he has received 
help from Lord Morley, Lord Bryce, and other sur- 
viving friends of Swinburne. 

An original edition is to be published of a thir- 
teenth-century French religious poem in praise of 
the Virgin Mary, " Li Romans dou Lis," contained 
in a unique manuscript in the library of Mr. J. 
Pierpont Morgan. The manuscript formerly be- 
longed to Lord Ashburnham. A critical introduc- 
tion was written by the late Dr. Frederick C. 
Ostrander, Adjunct Professor of Romance Lan- 
guages in the University of Texas, as a memorial 
to whom the present edition is being issued by 
Mr. Morgan through the Columbia University 
Press. The poem itself, which is in strophie form, 
and composed in various metres, numbers over 
4200 verses. 

Under the title of " Makers of the Nineteenth 
Century," Messrs. Holt, in conjunction with an 
English publishing house, have in preparation a 
new series of biographies, of which Mr. Basil 
Williams, the biographer of Chatham, is to be the 
general editor. Most of the books will deal with 
Englishmen and Americans, but it is also intended 
to include biographies of men of all countries who 
have had a definite influence on thought or action 
in the nineteenth century. The first four volumes 
to appear will be "John Delane " by Sir E. T. 
Cook, "Abraham Lincoln" by Lord Charnwood, 
" Herbert Spencer " by Mr. Hugh S. Elliot, and 
"Abdul Hamid " by Sir Edwin Pears. Biographies 
of Cecil Rhodes, Victor Hugo, General Lee, and 
Lord Shaftesbury are also in preparation. 

The announcement of a newly collected edition of 
Mrs. Aphra Behn's works is followed by news of a 
study of " The Life and Romances of Mrs. Eliza 
Haywood," who was described by Horace Walpole 
as the counterpart of Mrs. Behn, and by Swift as 
a " stupid, infamous, scribbling woman." It was 
Pope, however, who gave Mrs. Haywood her most 
unenviable immortality in some of his coarsest 
lines in the " Dunciad " for following the exam- 
ple of Mrs. Manley, and " such shameless scrib- 
blers," in repeating in her tales the scandalous 
gossip of her day. The forthcoming book on the 
life and romances of her contemporary, Mrs. Hay- 
wood, has been written by Dr. George F. Whicher, 
of the University of Illinois, for the " Columbia 
University Studies in English and Comparative 
Literature." 

We learn by way of London of a forthcoming 
study of " William Wordsworth : His Life, Works, 
and Influence," by Professor George McLean Har- 
per, of Princeton University, to whom we already 
owe a critical biography of Sainte-Beuve. It is 
based to a large extent on fresh material, and, in 
particular, will add to our knowledge of Words- 
worth's connection with the French Revolution, and 
of his visit to France in 1791, when he became inti- 
mately acquainted with the republican General 
Beaupuis. Professor Harper has also been able to 
throw fresh light upon other periods of Words- 
worth's career, about which scarcely any informa- 
tion has been available hitherto. The book, which 



120 



THE DIAL 



promises to be one of considerable importance as a 
contribution to the study of Wordsworth's life and 
thought, will be published in the autumn. 

Taking advantage of the opportunity presented 
by the elimination of the Tauchnitz Series in 
Prance, Russia, and Italy, Monsieur Louis Conard, 
the Paris publisher, announces for publication in 
the English language throughout the Continent of 
Europe a series of the latest (and forthcoming) 
copyrighted novels of the leading British and 
American authors. It was at first intended to 
await the conclusion of the present war before 
launching this enterprise, but it has been decided 
to begin publication at once with " Bealby," the 
new story by Mr. H. G. Wells, and " Delia Blanch- 
flower," the latest novel by Mrs. Humphry Ward. 
During the war new books will be issued at the 
rate of at least one a month. Later in the year, it 
is hoped to put forth books at the rate of one a 
week. The series is to be published at two francs 
a volume. 

A publication that has enjoyed wide popularity 
in England recently is " The Book of France," 
edited by Miss Winifred Stephens, and published 
in aid of the fund organized by the French Parlia- 
mentary Committee for the relief of the invaded 
Departments. Except that it begins with an ad- 
dress by Mr. Henry James, and closes with a poem 
by Mr. Rudyard Kipling, all the articles are the 
work of French men of letters. But the feature of 
the book is that, following each article, there 
appears a translation by some of our most distin- 
guished English writers. Mr. Thomas Hardy is 
responsible for two extracts a tribute to Great 
Britain by M. J. H. Rosny, nine, and some reflec- 
tions on the invasion of France by M. Remy de 
Gourmont ; as a rule, he keeps close to his original, 
though he sometimes employs a more expressive 
word, in one place rendering " notre sentiment " by 
" our heart's wound." Mr. Henry James's version 
of " The Saints of France " by M. Maurice Barres 
is quite in the style of Mr. Henry James; while 
Mr. H. G. Wells's translation of his own name 
deserves to be noticed. M. Anatole France wrote, 
in his opening sentence : " Ils se realisent les 
reves prophetiques de H. G. Wells." Mr. Wells 
translates this as follows : " The prophetic night- 
mares of our scientific f antastics are being lamenta- 
bly realized." 

The author of " God's Fool," who in the quarter- 
century of his literary activity wrote almost a score 
of successful novels all under the pseudonym, 
" Maarten Maartens " died on the fourth of this 
month at the age of fifty-seven years lacking eleven 
days. Joost Marius Willem Van der Poorten- 
Schwartz, as the novelist was known to his relatives 
and friends, was born at Amsterdam, spent much 
of his boyhood in England, was educated at the 
Royal Gymnasium in Bonn and the University of 
Utrecht, studied law and afterward lectured on law 
at the same university, but ultimately chose litera- 
ture for a profession, achieving his first decided 
success therein with his novel, " The Son of Joost 
Avelingh." Then in rapid sequence came "An Old 
Maid's Love," "A Question of Taste," "God's 



Fool," " The Greater Glory," and the rest of the 
now familiar stories that have made the writer's 
name famous in many lands ; for he has been trans- 
lated extensively, even, against his will (as it is 
said), into Dutch. Perhaps the unflattering quality 
of his pen-pictures of the middle-class society of 
Holland may help to explain his choice of a foreign 
language as his vehicle of expression, and his reluc- 
tance to have his books translated into his native 
tongue. Though not to be ranked with the immor- 
tals, Maarten Maartens won well-deserved fame as 
an unsparingly truthful delineator of Dutch char- 
acter, and his achievement is the more remarkable 
from his self-imposed handicap of an alien idiom 
in which to command the attention of the public.

Models of Journalistic Prose 

Selected and Discussed by J. W. Cunliffe, 
D.Litt., and Gerhard R. Lomer, Ph.D., 
of Columbia University 

Specimens of contemporary writing, dealing with 
matters of living interest, by well-known writers of today,

element of literary charm they are designed to appeal to 
students and their name is legion who find the usual 
classic models outside their interests and altogether beyond 
their reach. They include examples of description, narra- 
tion, the interview, exposition, controversy, humor, literary 
and dramatic criticism, etc., chosen from the better dailies, 
weeklies and monthlies of the United States and England. 
Among the authors represented are Lord Bryce, Huneker, 
Chesterton, Burroughs, H. G. Wells, Woodrow Wilson,

WRITERS and literary aspirants for 
twenty-one years have found in THE 
EDITOR the stimulating, friendly, prac- 
tical counsel that has lightened their burdens. 

Each fortnightly number contains inspiriting 
articles by editors and writers on artistic and 
business phases of authorship. The regular depart- 
ments "The Literary Market," "The Expe- 
rience Exchange," and "Questions and Answers" 
furnish vital information of prize story, essay, 
novel, play and other competitions, of new mag- 
azines, publishers, producers, etc., of changes of 
address, magazine combinations and suspensions, 
etc., of writers' business experiences with mag- 
azines, of coypright and other matters, etc. 

The desire of THE EDITOR is to give that 
sane, worth-while advice that will enable writers 
to realize to the utmost in mental and monetary 
satisfaction from their literary endeavors. 

Especial attention is paid to news of opportu- 
nities for writers to sell second-serial, photoplay, 
dramatic, post-card, and other rights of their work. 

Writers from Jack London and Mary Roberts Rinehart 
to Hapsburg Liebe, Octavus Roy Cohen, Crittendon 
Marriott, and hundreds of others, who to-day are working 
for and achieving the successes that will make them famous 
writers of the next few years, have testified to the help 
received from THE EDITOR. Mary Roberts Rinehart 
says: "THE EDITOR helped to start me, cheered me when 
I was down and led me in the straight path until I was able 
to walk alone." 

A single copy of THE EDITOR costs ten cents; every other 
Saturday for one year costs two dollars.

THE BEST SHORT STORIES. 

It would probably be too much to say that 
the short story is the peculiar literary form 
of the present day. It has displaced the poem 
and to .some extent the play, but still the Jug- 
gernaut of the novel rolls on even over it. 
And in many a past epoch it has been as exten- 
sively cultivated, and as highly wrought, as 
now. The Rhapsodists were Greek story- 
tellers who published their works orally. The 
Arabian story-teller has been a feature of 
Eastern life in all ages. The Mabinogion 
were Welsh stories told to the children of the 
chiefs by the winter fireside. The Icelandic 
Sagas answered the same purpose. In Italy 
when the Novelli were in bloom they threat- 
ened for a time to displace all other literature. 
And the golden age of even the modern short 
story must perhaps be placed some time 
back, when the German Romantic writers and 
Irving, Hawthorne, and Poe made new rec- 
ords in the art. 

The rank of the larger works of literature 
of the past is pretty well fixed. Until re- 
cently, however, short stories have hardly been 
given any rank at all; and though the world 
knows very well which of them it likes best, 
there is considerable difference of critical 
opinion in the matter. It may be worth while, 
therefore, to offer a judgment and argument 
as to what are the best dozen or so in existence. 

Before we bring our candidates on for judg- 
ment, we must have some rules for guidance 
in crowning them. In the first place, then, 
we think the short story should be unitary. 
Character, its development and its opposi- 
tions, the form hardly has room for. It is not 
so much who acts, as what happened, that is 
important. Theme, incident, and setting are 
therefore the prime requisites. In the second 
place, the great short story should have a cer- 
tain universality. It should be capable of 
general acceptation, it should not be stopped 
at the frontier of any country as alien or 
hostile. In the third place, it ought to have

a sort of key, opening a door to new vistas of 
the mind. 

Antiquity has transmitted to us few, if any, 
good short stories. The materials for them 
existed in abundance, and doubtless many 
were written; but if so, they have perished. 
The Lost Tales of Miletus are a tradition, and 
only the gist of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus 
has come down to us. Lucian comes nearest 
of any of the ancients to being a short story 
writer ; but most of his works are in dialogue, 
so they do not count for our purpose. And 
when we reach ^Esop we get into another 
form, as we do in the Indian fables of Pil- 
pay. The Scandinavian, Irish, and Welsh 
legends are magnificent literature; but from 
none of them does the short story, as we con- 
ceive it to-day, emerge. 

It is not until we reach " The Arabian 
Nights" that we find the type fixed for all 
time, and stories produced which have never 
been surpassed. The book indeed contains 
the germs, at least, of all possible kinds of 
short stories, and its influence has been pro- 
digious. Without stretching conscience much, 
we could almost fill our list of the world's 
twelve most famous short stories from this 
book alone. But we must save some honors 
for the moderns, and besides there are rea- 
sons which rule many of the Arabian tales 
out. We think, then, that "Aladdin," "The 
Sleeper Awakened," and "Ali Baba" fulfil 
the three requisites we have named. They 
are closely wrought in incident and scene; 
they have been accepted all over the world, 
and have furnished proverbial words or 
phrases; and they have been imitated and 
reproduced in many forms. " Sindbad the 
Sailor " and " The Barber and his Six Broth- 
ers" are equally great, but they are groups 
of tales rather than single pieces. "Prince 
Camaralzaman and Princess Badoura " opens 
magnificently, but it dies away into Eastern 
extravagance. The same is true of " Cam- 
buscan and his Horse of Brass." There are 
many other pieces in the collection that are 
immortal. One in particular probably gave 
Poe the basis on which he founded the throne 
of that detective dynasty which seems to rule 
modern literature. It is difficult to over- 
estimate the importance of " The Arabian 
Nights " in the history of the short story. 

The next great collection is that of Boccac- 
cio. As a monument and the mould of Italian 



prose it is of course most important. And as 
the work of a single man, it displays great 
variety and originality. Yet many of the 
pieces are not stories at all, but merely briefly 
told incidents. A good many more are after- 
dinner yarns, only in this case, told before 
the ladies have withdrawn. " Theodore and 
Honoria," "Cymon and Iphigenia," and "Isa- 
bella" are magnificent narratives, but they 
have rather been wrested from Boccaccio by 
Dryden and Keats. All in all, we can select 
only one story "Federigo and his Falcon";, 
but in revenge it strikes the highest and 
purest note of any piece on our list. 

Germany is a perfect jungle of Marchen r 
or short stories. But we are hunting for what 
may be called world tales, and we confess we 
can think of but few in German literature. 
Chamisso's "Peter Schlemihl" is one. And 
we must have "Undine," also, though it is 
rather too long to come under the genre we 
are considering ; but it fulfils all our require- 
ments, and its vogue makes it indispensable. 
The popular legend of " The Flying Dutch- 
man " ought to be on our list too ; but we are 
acquainted with no prose recension of it 
except that of Heine's, which hardly comes, 
up to the mark. Baron Munchausen is a type, 
but the stories he tells are either too brief or 
are imitations of older work. Altogether, the 
German contingent brings our accepted mas- 
terpieces to six. 

The French short story writers have every- 
thing the Germans lack perfect form, wit, 
point, charm. Yet ranging among them, from 
Cyrano de Bergerac down through Chateau- 
briand, Lamartine, Musset, Balzac, Gautier, 
Merimee, Maupassant, it is rather difficult to- 
find a story which is at once perfect, pro- 
foundly original, and winged for world-wide 
circulation. Musset's "White Blackbird" is 
charming and significant; and Merimee's- 
" Carmen," in one shape or another, has made 
the voyage of the world. But we hardly think 
that either of them is universal enough. 
Though " Paul and Virginia," like " Undine," 
transcends the short story form, it is the only 
tale we can conscientiously include in our list. 
A few years ago Maupassant was considered 
the last cry in short story genre. He ha& 
great merits, it is true, but his pieces are more 
like epigrams than stories. And we doubt very 
much whether they have yet sunk, or will 
ever sink, deeply into the world's mind.

The prose short story was a long time get- 
ting itself domiciled and growing to greatness 
in England. The essayists, Addison, Steele, 
Goldsmith, have hints and adumbrations of 
it; but what they produced were sketches of 
character., vignettes of adventure. Dr. John- 
son, in " Rasselas," was perhaps the first who 
did what comes near to being the real thing. 
That piece, however, is too long, too heavy, 
and too full of moralizing to answer our pur- 
pose. Sir Walter Scott's "Wandering Wil- 
lie's Tale" fulfils all our requisites; though 
perhaps because it is embedded in a novel, it 
has not had all the fame it deserves. Mrs. 
Shelley's " Frankenstein " would satisfy us, 
too, only she did not know how to construct 
or when to stop. She furnished a proverbial 
figure for the world, but the story itself is 
hardly readable. De Quincey had all the art 
and accomplishment of a first rate short 
story writer, and he taught the business to 
others. Nearly all his great successors have 
felt his influence. But for one reason or 
another, nothing of his own is in the running. 
"The Spanish Nun" and "The Flight of a 
Tartar Tribe " have immense verve and inter- 
est, but they are historical pieces. The two 
papers on " Murder Considered as One of the 
Fine Arts " almost form a short story ; but, 
after all, they are essays. Bulwer's " The 
Haunted and the Haunters" is perhaps the 
best ghost story ever written, but it is too lack- 
ing in humanity ever to be seriously consid- 
ered for our laurelled company. Dickens, 
Thackeray, George Eliot, Meredith, has any 
one of these been more successful in this 
regard ? We doubt it. It is not until we come 
to Stevenson that we get any real competi- 
tor for place. There are half a score of 
Stevenson's stories so equally good that it is 
difficult to choose between them. None of 
them, however, has quite the universality we 
should desire; but we will take "A Lodging 
for the Night " as the nearest to our standard. 

For some reason or other, America has been 
the modern home of the short story. That 
form has seemed to suit both the talents of our 
writers and the tether of our public's patience. 
Irving's " Rip Van Winkle " is as famous as a 
story can be ; it is known everywhere. There 
are many other of Irving's pieces which are 
only a little less excellent; and we wonder 
that some publisher does not issue a single- 
volume collection of a score or so of them. 



Such a collection would be a revelation to 
modern readers. Poe took the crown of the 
short story from his own head and placed it 
on Hawthorne's; and the latter has an im- 
mense, though we believe a rather fading and 
ineffectual, fame in this art. With the best 
will in the world, we cannot yet accept any 
one of Hawthorne's short stories for our final 
few. Perfection of execution they have, and 
a kind of originality. But they have been 
stopped at the frontiers of other countries, 
and they have not much influenced succeed- 
ing writers. Poe is in himself a rival for all 
the host of authors of " The Arabian Nights." 
His influence on the short story has been para- 
mount and overwhelming. We should select 
from him " The Gold Bug," " The Murders in 
the Rue Morgue," and " The Fall of the House 
of Usher," not because these are the best 
things in his prose, but because they are his 
best short stories, and because they have led 
the whole world to follow and imitate them. 
Instead of the twelve stories we set out to find, 
we now have a baker's dozen. Yet we must 
add one more, for Bret Harte was really the 
precursor of the best English short story writ- 
ers of recent times. If Stevenson is to have a 
place, then the American cannot be neglected. 
Any one of a half dozen of Bret Harte's sto- 
ries will do, but perhaps in " The Luck of 
Roaring Camp " the new view he opened and 
his universality are most apparent. 

As we have intimated above, we think that 
there have been more great American short 
story writers, and more of a calibre only less 
than the greatest, than in any other country. 
Away back in the dawn of our literature there 
is "The Story of Peter Rugg," a good 
variant on the "Flying Dutchman" theme. 
Fitz- James O'Brien wrote two or three sto- 
ries of great merit. Colonel Higginson's 
"Monarch of Dreams" is a superb piece of 
writing, and Edward Everett Hale's "Man 
without a Country " makes plain sober fact of 
impossible fiction. Thomas Bailey Aldrich 
invented a plot of surprise, and his stories are 
full of grace and charm. No one has ever 
been more oddly original than Frank Stock- 
ton. Recently " 0. Henry " wrought out the 
unexpected with a terseness which the French 
might envy. There are others who have done 
lasting work ; and we believe, as we have said 
before, that our achievement in this field sur- 
passes anything that other nations can show.

Of course it must be understood that all the 
hypercriticism in the foregoing paragraphs is 
merely an attempt to get at the essential types 
of the short story. Innumerable pieces that 
we have passed by are good and more than 
good. And of course we do not attempt to sit 
in judgment on living masters of the art. 

Going over our selections, we find that four 
among them, "Aladdin," "Peter Schlemihl," 
"Undine," and "Wandering Willie's Tale," 
deal with the supernatural. Two others, "Ali 
Baba" and "Rip Van Winkle," have to do 
with the marvellous which hardly amounts to 
the supernatural. " The Sleeper Awakened " 
is a tale of pure humor and human nature. 
"Federigo and his Falcon," and "Paul and 
Virginia " are stories of young love and devo- 
tion. " The Gold Bug " is the exemplar of all 
possible treasure stories; as "A Lodging for 
the Night" is of the nomad and vagabond 
species. " The Fall of the House of Usher " 
gives us intellect dominant and in ruin, with 
nature sympathizing with it. " The Luck of 
Roaring Camp " is a good specimen of primi- 
tive and adventurous life. And lastly, " The 
Murders in the Rue Morgue" launched the 
detective into literature, with all the interest- 
ing or horrible consequence of that debut. We 
think this fairly covers, and in good propor- 
tion, the main strands suitable for short story 
weaving. That there will be in the future any 
wide departure from these themes seems to us 
unlikely, though of course minor threads of 
the web of life may be taken up and devel- 
oped. One thing is noticeable about our 
elect, none of them is extremely short. The 
great masters have refused to turn their sto- 
ries into Dodonian oracles. 

What is the place of the short story in lit- 
erature ? The very qualities we claimed for it 
in starting preclude it from the first rank. 
In a form where there is not room enough to 
swing a cat, there cannot be equality with the 
great dramas, epics, or novels. In a form 
where character is secondary, great action, 
passion, thought can hardly be developed. 
Design and plot, too, must be curtailed, though 
perhaps these gain as much as they lose by 
condensation. What is left to the short story 
is uniqueness. It is really a prose poem, and 
must take its place with the short verse nar- 
ratives and ballads. It can hardly have the 
literary value of these ; but it can be, and is 
more popular. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

EDITORIAL INITIATIVE, as opposed to edito- 
rial subserviency to a real or supposed popu- 
lar demand for unwholesome reading matter, 
is conspicuous in comparatively few of our 
daily and other periodical publications. All 
the more cheering, therefore, is it to find cer- 
tain strong and wise utterances on the subject 
by journalists and writers of principle and 
purpose, in a " Symposium " constituting one 
of the chapters of " The Coming Newspaper," 
a book noticed more in detail on another 
page. Dr. Charles M. Sheldon feels con- 
vinced that "the daily paper, the magazine, 
and every other periodical, have just as much 
of a duty to give the people the thing they 
need instead of what they want, as the minis- 
ter has to give his people what they need 
instead of what they want." Of course, as it 
may be worth while to say in passing, what 
the people " want " is really, in the etymologi- 
cal sense of the word, nothing else than what 
fhey "need," though they do not know it. 
What they sometimes foolishly wish and 
clamor for, is another thing. But even this 
unwise longing may be less spontaneous, less 
unfostered from without, than is commonly 
assumed. Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard, recog- 
nizing that " the newspaper certain news- 
papers at least is largely responsible for 
the public's low taste," continues, signifi- 
cantly : " It would be well worth your while, 
if you are not familiar with the journals of 
1850 to 1865, to hunt up some bound volumes 
of the New York ' Tribune ' and ' Herald ' and 
the Springfield 'Republican,' and other news- 
papers of the time, and study them ; and you 
will be surprised what fine newspapers they 
were, what fine standards they had, how intel- 
ligent was the comment. Editorially, they 
were, of course, superior to the bulk of the 
newspapers today. They were clean; there 
were no large headlines. They were as effi- 
cient as we are in the way of giving the news 
and giving it accurately. I don't think that 
we can plume ourselves over that generation 
of editors, for all our modern facilities." 
Assuredly there were editorial giants in those 
days, but there is no reason to believe that 
the secret of good editorship was buried with 
them. m m m 

COMMISSION GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC 
LIBRARY have not yet become minutely famil- 
iar with each other's ways. Fears are still 
felt in some quarters lest existing library 
laws and usage and precedent may fail to 
chime harmoniously with the new order of 
procedure introduced into municipal affairs

by the recent form of city government known 
as government by commission. Thus far no 
disastrous conflict of interests has come to 
general notice, but all the possibilities of the 
situation have doubtless not yet been ex- 
hausted. Meanwhile it is cheering to note in 
at least one commission-governed city Bir- 
mingham, Alabama a cordial cooperation 
between commissioners and library officials. 
A late number of " The Birmingham Maga- 
zine," a creditable publication such as one 
may look for in vain in hundreds of larger 
cities, contains an article of some length on 
" Social Service Work of the City Com- 
mission," written by President George B. 
Ward, of the Birmingham Board of Commis- 
sioners, and replete with evidence that the 
schools, the library, the parks, playgrounds, 
welfare and health departments of various 
sorts under the city's control are objects of 
more than perfunctory attention from the 
administrative authorities. Especially notice- 
able is the interest taken in the development 
of the public library, which has a history of 
only five years to look back upon, but already 
makes a showing that compares favorably 
with the well-known useful activity of Atlan- 
ta's similar institution, though the latter is 
more than three times as old ; and this record 
of Birmingham's progress in the populariza- 
tion of good literature synchronizes with the 
history of commission government in that 
city, as is pointed out with justifiable pride 
in the following words: "When the Com- 
mission came into office the Birmingham Pub- 
lic Library was an organization kept up by 
paid subscriptions and reaching but a limited 
number. To-day, as a free public library, it 
is the epitome of service and efficiency under 
the splendid management of Mr. Carl H. 
Milan." Difficult would it be to find any 
municipal chief magistrate under the old 
order of things expressing himself with such 
intelligence, zeal, and public spirit of the best 
sort, on the social welfare work of his city, as 
one notes in Mr. Ward's utterance. 


THE MISSION OF MIRTH in literature is no 
unimportant, no undignified one; and the 
role of the proverbial jester who purveys fun 
and cheerfulness to all the world while his 
own heart may be breaking is of a heroism 
and a pathos not always recognized. The 
late Charles Battell Loomis, writing books of 
amusement and touring the country as a pro- 
fessional humorist, was all the time slowly 
dying of an incurable malady and fully con- 
scious of the hopelessness of his condition. 
A younger contemporary of his, George Fitch, 



widely known for his syndicated "Vest- 
Pocket Essays" that have long enlivened a 
host of newspaper readers, went to California 
in quest of health, and his death was an- 
nounced on the very day his readers were 
enjoying his jest at the identical disease that 
prematurely cut him off. George Heleghon 
Fitch, not to be confused with Mr. George 
Hamlin Fitch of the San Francisco " Chron- 
icle," was born at Galva, Illinois, June 5, 
1877; was graduated from Knox College in 
1897 ; entered upon journalism, and began to 
win more than local fame about ten years ago 
with his witty " Transcripts " in the Peoria 
" Transcript," of which he had become man- 
aging editor. Four years ago he severed this 
connection and devoted himself to less ephem- 
eral literary work. In addition to his " Vest- 
Pocket Essays," of which a collection was 
published last year under the title, " Sizing 
up Uncle Sam," he wrote " The Big Strike at 
Siwash," "At Good Old Siwash," " My Demon 
Motor Boat," and " Homeburg Memories." 
He died on the ninth of August. On the very 
same day, or the next (there are conflicting 
reports), there died another contributor to 
the sum of human cheerfulness, Charles 
Heber Clark, or " Max Adeler," as he chose to 
call himself when writing in lighter vein. 
Known in Philadelphia and beyond as a 
manufacturer and a writer of repute on 
economics, the tariff, and kindred themes, he 
also produced books whose purpose was to 
entertain and amuse. " Out of the Hurly- 
Burly " is a collection of stories widely popu- 
lar and so heartily enjoyed, it is said, by the 
Emperor of Austria that he sent the author a 
gold medal. " Elbow Room " is another vol- 
ume of the same nature. " Captain Bluitt," 
" In Happy Hollow," " The Quakeress," and 
"By the Bend of the River" represent his 
more sustained efforts in fictitious narrative, 
but are touched with the same geniality that 
had early marked him as a very enjoyable 
humorist. He was born at Berlin, Maryland, 
July 11, 1841, and died at Eaglesmere, Penn- 
sylvania, at the age of seventy-four. 


RUSSIA'S DEARTH OF BOOKS AND LIBRARIES 

appears so great, to one viewing the vast 
empire as a whole, that it might not be far 
from the truth to call Russia a bookless na- 
tion. Until the late prohibition of the sale of 
vodka (except in the Caucasus and central 
Asia, where the government does not control 
this sale) the sole distraction from the tedium 
of a hard existence had been found in drink, 
with the great mass of the common people. 
But with the discontinuance of that sale,

which dates from the outbreak of the present 
war, though the causal connection between the 
two is much less close than is commonly as- 
sumed, there has been a natural longing for 
spare-hour amusement or occupation, a long- 
ing that will eventually, it is hoped, find a 
worthier gratification than was formerly fur- 
nished by the ubiquitous dramshop. Money, 
too, as well as time, is now increasingly at the 
peasant's disposal, thanks to the new order of 
things. Mr. Stephen Graham, who knows the 
country as few but the Russians themselves 
know it, writes on " Prohibition in Russia " in 
" The World's Work," and predicts a remark- 
able growth of culture among the people as 
soon as peace is restored. He says: "After 
the war there must flow from the great cities 
of the West of Russia books, papers, dress 
materials, musical instruments, pictures, guns 
[the last-named might be dispensed with]. 
And more schools must be established, more 
concert halls, lecture halls. There will be 
more schooling, reading, music, hunting. If 
the policy of the Russian Government with 
regard to drink remains unchanged for the 
next ten years, it is safe to predict a most 
extraordinary contrast between the condition 
of the country now and the condition as it 
must be then." The probability of this con- 
tinuance is asserted, and to the Czar is 
ascribed the credit thereof. Surely here is 
virgin soil for the labors of library extension- 
ists and other promoters of popular culture. 



THE EESTORATION OP FRuiTLANos by Miss 
Clara Endicott Sears, of Boston, whose ac- 
count of the eccentric Fruitlanders and 
their " Consociate Family " is one of the nota- 
ble books of the season, is cause for congratu- 
lation. Miss Sears bought the property two 
years ago. It adjoins her summer place at 
Harvard (the town, not the university), and 
her intelligent zeal and generous expenditure 
of money have put the old house back into its 
condition of sixty-two years ago, when Alcott 
and his little band of visionary reformers 
took up their residence there. As far as pos- 
sible, the original furniture has been rein- 
stated, and to-day Miss Sears feels justified 
in saying : " The house is now exactly as it 
was in 1843. The foundations of the chim- 
neys were intact so that I was able to rebuild 
them as they were. The paint had entirely 
disappeared with time, but under the eaves 
there remained patches of red, and I was 
able to give it again the old ochre-red color 
which it had worn in the early days. The 
old granary has been turned into a home for 
the care-taker, but the structure was not 



changed." She adds that the building was a 
pathetic object indeed when she took it in 
hand, dilapidated and empty except for a 
few old odds and ends in the garret; but its 
present refurnishing she asserts to be " au- 
thentic in every way," with the community 
bean-pot recovered, and Joseph Palmer's 
oxskin money-bag, Charles Lane's cowhide 
trunk, Mrs. Alcott's Paisley shawl, letters of 
Louisa Alcott, and Mr. Alcott's spectacles, in 
addition to the furniture of the several rooms. 
Fruitlands is now open to visitors three days 
in the week Tuesday, Thursday, and Sat- 
urday during the summer. Miss Sears de- 
serves the gratitude of her own generation 
and of posterity for her rescue of this object 
of historic and literary interest. 


THE LAST MEMBER OF AN OLD PUBLISHING 

FIRM, John Wesley Harper, died at Bidde- 
ford Pool on the fourteenth of August, at the 
age of eighty-four. Had he lived a year and 
seven months longer he could have joined in 
celebrating the centennial of the House of 
Harper, to the second generation of which he 
belonged, being the son of John Harper of the 
original J. & J. Harper, established in March, 
1817. Graduated from Columbia College in 
1852, at the head of his class, he chose medi- 
cine as his profession, and went abroad to 
study and to discover that he had no vocation 
for the healing art; so he returned, entered 
the paternal business house, and became a 
member of the firm in 1869, with Philip J. A. 
Harper, Joseph W. Harper, Jr., Fletcher 
Harper, Jr., and Joseph Abner Harper. The 
style, " Harper & Brothers," had been adopted 
in 1833, and the business increased so rapidly 
that when the subject of this sketch assumed 
the presidency of the firm in 1897 there was 
said to be no publishing house equal to it in 
the extent of its dealings. With the reorgani- 
zation that was made necessary by financial 
embarrassments fifteen years ago, Mr. Harper 
retired from business; and though there still 
continue to be Harpers in sufficient number 
at the famous Franklin Square establish- 
ment, the older stock has lost its last repre- 
sentative. For a full and entertaining his- 
tory of those earlier publishers the reader is 
referred to " The House of Harper," by Mr. 
J. Henry Harper, published a few years ago. 


PURGING A LANGUAGE BY FIRE is the process 
that may be said to have been begun with the 
German tongue when the fatherland drew its 
sword against the non-Teutonic world. En- 
glish, French, Russian, and Italian words or 
derivatives are now an abomination in Ber-

lin, and the resources of the native speech are 
being strained to supply home-made equiva- 
lents for these foreign terms. A former En- 
glish Lecturer at the Karlsruhe Hochschule 
writes of " The Wor and the Werld Langwij " 
in " The Pioneer ov Simplified Speling," pre- 
dicting an increase in the cosmopolitan use of 
English when peace is restored, and a stricter 
confinement of German to the land of its 
origin. Transposing the spelling of the arti- 
cle in question, let us quote a few sentences. 
The writer believes that "one result of the 
victory of the Allies is that Germany will con- 
tinue the process of elimination of foreign 
words which they began on the outbreak of 
the War. During the six weeks I was in 
Karlsruhe after the War began, this move- 
ment to replace French and English words by 
native German equivalents had begun. The 
4 Cafe Piccadilly ' had become ' Gasthaus zum 
Vaterland.' A 'beefsteak' had been chris- 
tened a 'Rindstiick'. . . The French 'sauce' 
has become a ' Tunke.' " And so on. With 
English already spoken by 130,000,000 per- 
sons (the writer's figures, and they are not 
excessive), and German hopelessly out of the 
running, while not even French ("the patois 
of Europe," as Walter Bagehot called it) can 
vie with English in extent of its use, there is 
surely some reason to expect an increasing 
employment of our tongue as a world-speech 
unless the Esperantists carry the day, 
which is not at present likely, or unless, after 
all, we non-Teutons should have the speech of 
General von Bernhardi rammed down our 
throats with German sabres, which is also 
not among the probabilities. 



FRANKLIN'S EPITAPH, written by himself at 
the age of twenty-two, an age when this sort 
of literary exercise has a purely academic 
interest which it loses in later life, has for a 
dozen years been accessible to the curious in 
such things, in the valuable autograph collec- 
tion of the Library of Congress, for which it 
was acquired from the government archives, 
which at an earlier date had secured it from 
the papers of William Temple Franklin. But 
it now appears that this cherished autograph 
is a revision (by the author and in his hand- 
writing, it is true) of the original inspiration, 
which has lately been brought to light in the As- 
pinwall papers and secured, through a Boston 
dealer, by Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach of the city 
in which it was written. These papers, once 
the property of Colonel Thomas L. Aspinwall, 
in his time a noted collector of Americana, 
must contain a multitude of almost priceless 
items; but probably few would so excite the 



desires of the covetous as this bit of scribbling 
from Franklin's pen. In its unrevised form it 
runs as follows : " The body of B. Franklin, 
printer, like the cover of an old book, its con- 
tents torn out and stript of its lettering and 
gilding, lies here, food for worms. But the 
work shall not be wholly lost, for it will, as he 
believed, appear once more, in a new and more 
perfect edition, corrected and amended by the 
Author." Then is added the date of birth, 

with so much of the date of death (" 17 ") 

as could at that time be conjectured with rea- 
sonable certainty. Division into lines, with 
capitalization, has here been disregarded. In 
the revised copy the logical Franklin, reason- 
ing that "perfect" admits of no degrees of 
comparison, substituted "elegant," and he 
also enclosed in parentheses his likening of the 
lifeless body to the outside of an old book. 
Other minor changes also appear. 



A BYRONIC DISCOVERY, or what the discov- 
erer believed to be such, forms the subject of 
the opening article in " The English Review " 
for August. The late Bertram Dobell, some 
years ago, came into possession of a small 
pamphlet entitled "A Farrago Libelli: A\ 
Poem, Chiefly Imitated from the First Satire 
of Juvenal." It was " printed for Mr. Hatch- 
ard, 1806," and, according to a note at the 
foot of the first page, "written at Twicken- 
ham, 1805." Mr. Dobell held his copy to be 
unique, and believed the piece to have been 
suppressed by its author immediately upon 
its appearance. The poem itself, running to 
three hundred and forty lines, and Mr. 
Dobell's critical commentary, fill twenty-four 
pages of the above-named magazine. A gen- 
eral resemblance in style to "English Bards 
and Scotch Reviewers" is manifest in the 
satire, and many special points of resem- 
blance the commentator thought he had 
detected and took pains to place before his 
readers. Not entirely convincing is the able 
argument, either in general or in detail, 
though there appears no good reason why 
Byron, even though but nineteen years old 
at the time, might not have written the fluent 
verses (in the familiar decasyllabic metre of 
" English Bards ") composing the " Farrago." 
Yet it is not a production of sufficient merit 
and distinction to bring any access to Byron's 
fame, should he finally be accounted the 

author. 



ART IN THE LIBRARY, in the form of paint- 
ings, engravings, statuary, rare bindings, fur- 
niture of tasteful design, and in the entire

[ Sept. 2 



library building, takes a place that need be 
second only to that of literature. The ways 
of popularizing art through the public library 
are many, and those who would learn some- 
thing about their number and variety should 
read Miss Mary McEaehin Powell's " Making 
Art Popular through the Library," an ac- 
count of this kind of work in the St. Louis 
Public Library, by the head of the depart- 
ment. In ten chapters or sections, filling a 
pamphlet of fifty pages, Miss McEaehin de- 
scribes the development and success of her 
branch of the library. Among other interest- 
ing details, we read that every month two 
paintings from the City Art Museum, selected 
by the Director of the St. Louis School of 
Fine Arts, are displayed in the Children's 
Room ; and once a week the Director himself 
comes and gives a talk on these paintings to 
children of the fifth and sixth grades, and to 
those of the higher grades, alternately. Forty 
or fifty young listeners, with several teachers, 
comprise each of these groups, and an effort 
is made to secure constant attendance and thus 
render the course progressive. Informality 
on the lecturer's part encourages participa- 
tion on that of the children in the discussions, 
and it is reported that the audience shows 
intense interest and carries away vivid and 
lasting impressions. Pupils of the above- 
named art school have contributed many 
pleasing and some striking illustrations to 
Miss McEachin's pamphlet, which contains a 
greater variety of readable and instructive 
matter than can here be indicated. 



THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SIM- 
PLIFIED SPELLERS offers food for reflection, 
whether or not the reflector is able to arrive 
at any general law governing the outbreak 
and spread of the peculiar mania to which 
these persons are victims. In the current 
number of the " Simplified Speling Bulletin " 
is a list of universities and colleges and nor- 
mal schools, grouped by states, that have 
given their sanction to simplified spelling; 
and the briefest glance at the table shows the 
middle West to be the stronghold of the cult, 
with surprisingly few adherents in the East 
and in the far West. The South, too, seems 
either prudently conservative in the matter or 
apathetic. In New England only three insti- 
tutions, including a normal school in Ver- 
mont, appear on the list ; and outside of New 
England there are but two other Atlantic 
states (New York and Pennsylvania) in 
which opposition to the accepted orthography 
has developed any strength. West of the 
Mississippi basin only Colorado and Oregon 



are named, each represented by a single col- 
lege. " Simplified Speling in the Pres," an 
article in the same journal, presents a similar 
tabulation in respect to newspaper and peri- 
odical adoption of the new forms; and here, 
too, the zeal of the interior contrasts with the 
paucity of interest on both coasts, except that 
California (unrepresented in the former list) 
reports one perverted newspaper, and Wyo- 
ming nine, including two student publica- 
tions. Here, then, we have a sort of meeting 
of extremes East and West agreeing to re- 
tain the old spelling, and the central region 
showing more desire for a change. Does this 
geographical arrangement, after an analogy 
that will occur to the reader, imply that the 
subverters of the present order have the 
strategic advantage? 



AN INCENTIVE TO ITALIAN PATRIOTISM takes 

the form of a popular paper-covered edition, 
in the language of Dante and Petrarch, of 
that famous American masterpiece of more 
than half a century ago, " The Man without 
a Country." The compatriots of Garibaldi 
are of just the sort to be fired by such a tale 
from the pen of one whom the translator in 
his preface calls the greatest American of his 
time. A writer in " The Christian Register " 
relates that he once asked Dr. Hale whether 
he himself really felt his wonderful story as 
deeply as he made the reader feel it. So 
prompt and emphatic was the affirmative an- 
swer as to leave no further doubt in the 
questioner's mind. This kind of feeling, with 
all that it too often implies of international 
antagonism, is perhaps not in great need of 
strengthening just at present in any Euro- 
pean country, however glad we may be to see 
the fame of Dr. Hale and his best-known 
work of literature widen its bounds. 



IN SOMNOLENT NIPPON, according to Mrs. 
Yosano, one of the " new women " of Japan, 
there is still a sad need of the awakening call 
of literature to dispel the slumberous vacuity 
into which the natives, unless actively em- 
ployed, are ever prone to fall. She writes in 
a late issue of " Taiyo," as quoted (in English 
not always quite orthodox) : " The Japanese, 
men and women, are often seen dozing off 
their ride on public vehicles, to wit the train, 
the tram, the stage coach, etc. There may be 
some excuse for this in the afternoons of the 
long-day season. But they do it when days 
are short, and in the morning at that. The 
Europeans in transit are always reading 
something and never look tired. The dif- 
ference is striking." And further : " The 



1915] 



THE DIAL

Japanese in general are given to sleeping in 
daytime. The students fall asleep in the 
class room, the Ministers of State and Repre- 
sentatives of people go off dozing in the Diet, 
preachings and public speeches send the audi- 
ence to dreamland. A majority of Japanese 
people are always tired they seem to be suf- 
fering from nervous debility." Few writers, 
whether native or foreign, have more severely 
censured the Japanese for superficiality, imi- 
tation, easy content with the present and what 
it offers, than does this representative of that 
far-eastern nation. Her advice, which may 
not be the easiest possible to follow, is that 
the Japanese should adopt a more invigorat- 
ing diet, eat more meat, and thus brace them- 
selves for a more energetic assault upon life's 
problems, both material and spiritual. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

A PLEA FOR ALLEGORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It may be said without exaggeration that what 
is known as cultivated taste, that is, the taste of 
readers who in the main enjoy the educational 
advantages of wealth or good breeding, turns 
from Allegory with a feeling akin to nausea. So 
keenly do the editors of our magazines realize the 
intensity of this aversion that a manuscript carry- 
ing about it the slightest scent of allegory is 
rejected immediately. With the spirit of a ram- 
bler who finds a pensive pleasure in the deserted 
fields of literature, let us look into this matter a 
little. There may be some profit in the task, too; 
for no one can visit a prehistoric mound, or even 
a grassy depression in a pasture once the cellar of 
a long since vanished cabin (and is not mind and 
vacant cellar allegory's metaphorical kindred by a 
common fate?) without some creative stir in the 
mind. 

That pure allegory was a natural growth in the 
field of literature is as well established as that the 
wild plum and the wild rose blossomed everywhere 
in the primeval forests of our country. What 
then? Well, we know why the wild plum has dis- 
appeared; and it is for a like reason that the alle- 
gory has gone. The plum's life was possible only 
in the shadows of those mighty woods, with their 
deep and rarely broken silence. But now the pio- 
neer's axe rings, the big trees fall, sunlight floods 
in, and the wild plum dies. So with allegory: 
when the primaeval forests of the mind, so to speak, 
were cleared off, pure allegory could not stand the 
sunlight of obviousness and gave up the ghost. 
White, sweet, and modest was the wild plum's 
bloom, and it has its analogue in style, for style 
is the flowering of literature; sweet and modest 
was allegory's bloom, too, and rich and impor- 
tant was its fruit. For who can measure the value 
of newly awakened and spontaneous ideas in virgin 



mental soil, or the refining and strengthening and 
exalting influence of imagination taking flight? 

But above all and more than all, how many who 
are now dust, heirs to adversity and sorrow, had 
their toiling and obscure lives cheered by the sight 
of the Delectable Mountains, and by hearing the 
harps and trumpets which greeted poor Pilgrim 
the nearest brother to the average man that pen has 
ever produced at the end of his long journey ! 
May we not, then, visit this ancient mound in the 
deserted field of literature with profit, loiter around 
it for a while, and from time to time hear voices out 
of the past proclaiming what a part allegory played 
in the lives of thousands whose clay is now blended 
with the common earth? Surely it does the soul 
good to be a listener when the past speaks. 

And finally, to pursue the figure another step, let 
us mount to the top. Lo ! off to the east where 
literature's dawn first flushed, what star is that we 
see amid a glowing constellation of Prophets and 
Seers? It is David with his harp, singing pure 
allegory in the eightieth psalm. Nearer in Poetry's 
garden and in our own tongue, Spenser's Faerie 
Queene is singing pure allegory to the rapt enjoy- 
ment of the lords and ladies of England; and 
along green hedgerows and among the poor and 
lowly, John Bunyan is singing the Pilgrim's Prog- 
ress toward the Celestial City. Was there nausea 
then? No; for then the primaeval forests of the 
mind were still shadowing the elementary and 
natural feelings of man's nature; and warmed by 
the poet's high-beating heart, they gathered and 
bloomed into allegory, just as the wild plum and 
the wild rose's elements, feeling the warmth of 
nature's heart, burst into bloom. 

And are those elements out of which they spring 
still in the soil of the mind? Yes, I think there is 
abundant evidence that they are still there. Take 
Shelley's ode " To a Skylark," which is certainly 
not nauseous, at least up to this date in our march 
toward utter fastidiousness, does it not open with 
allegory? Or take that first stanza of " In State " 
by Forcythe Wilson, oversoaring in my judgment 
all other poems of the Civil War period, not except- 
ing Lowell's banner-waving and patriotic rhetoric, 
with its well-burnished and glistening common- 
place. Here we certainly have allegory, 

" O Keeper of the sacred Key, 
And the Great Seal of Destiny, 
Whose eye is the blue canopy, 
Look down upon the warring world, and tell 
us what the end will be." 

To sum it all up, go where you will in the fields 
of living prose and poetry, and you will find it; 
not blooming exactly in the old obvious way, but in 
profound unself consciousness. Allegory, then, like 
every creation of the mind, must bring writer and 
reader into a state of perfect unselfconsciousness, 
that state of mind which Spenser's and Bunyan's 
readers were in. 

Dreary, machine-made, and wooden in its gait is 
the most of our current prose. If the editors of 
our magazines would encourage natural expression 
and natural gait, sooner or later cultivated taste 
would find itself unself conscious ; and lost in the 



142

presence of sincerity and beautified truth, the 
pages of their magazines might be what Spenser's 
and Bunyan's pages were to their readers, glow- 
ing inspiration. MORRIS SCHAFF.

WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY AND WILLIAM 

BLAKE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Of William Vaughn Moody's Idea of God, 
Professor Manly says (Introduction to " Poems 
and Poetic Dramas of William Vaughn Moody," 
p. XLII. ) : "It was not a formal philosophical con- 
ception, but a poetical vision incorporating the 
most diverse elements of culture." We believe that 
no one has yet pointed out that the writings of 
William Blake were one element of that culture. 
" God figures ambiguously in Moody's poetry," 
continues Mr. Manly ; " sometimes as the Puritan 
God, whom he does not love and in whom he does 
not believe ; sometimes as the no less anthropomor- 
phic God from whom he cannot keep his fellowship 
and love." 

Now Blake had two Gods also, the " God of 
this World," corresponding to Moody's Puritan 
God, and the Supreme God, whose anthropomor- 
phic nature he set forth in his painting, his lyrics, 
and his Prophetical Books. 

Moody was no such heretic as Blake, yet in his 
" Masque of Judgment " he " spoke out in meet- 
ing," to quote his own words in a letter to 
Professor Schevill, June 8, 1897. To Mrs. Toy 
again (Dec. 12, 1900) he writes that the poem is 
" a plea for passion as a means of salvation every- 
where latent." The mythological machinery, he 
says, " symbolizes the opposed doctrine that of 
the denial of life. As Christianity (contrary to the 
wish and meaning of its founder) has historically 
linked itself with this doctrine, I included certain 
aspects of it in this mythological apparatus 
always with a semi-satirical intention." Moody's 
satire and passion here correspond to Blake's war 
on historical Christianity, and his exaltation of 
Imagination. Of course they do not include Blake's 
Everlasting Gospel of Jesus, with its theory of 
constant and willing forgiveness of all Sin and its 
identification of Christ and Man with God. 

Moody, on the contrary, accepted good and evil 
in the world, as Blake did; but he did not recom- 
mend evil-doing as the first law of Salvation. He 
wished good and evil to contend with one another, 
that good might be exercised, and triumph. In 
Act V. of the " Masque of Judgment " Uriel tells 
Raphael that God " loved not life entirely, good 
and ill " ; adding, " when evil dies, as soon good 
languishes"; whereupon Raphael, the friend of 
Man, exclaims: 

" Would he had spared 
That dark Antagonist whose enmity 
Gave Him rejoicing sinews, for of Him, 
His foe was flesh of flesh and bone of bone, 
With suicidal hand He smote him down, 
And now, indeed, His lethal pangs begin." 

In " The Brute," again, the evil that lurks in 
modern machinery and Efficiency is overpowered in 
the end by good and serves it. There is no senti- 



mental denial of evil here; nor is there in Blake. 
But Moody calls on the good to contend with evil;. 
Blake bids the good embrace evil, that Christ may 
forgive. 

Reminiscent of Blake's childhood, when " God 
put his face to the window" (Moody and Lovett's 
" History of English Literature," p. 265) are 
Moody's lines in " Jetsam " : 

" Once at a simple turning of the way 
I met God walking." 

A passage in Act II. of the mystical drama, " The 
Faith Healer," moreover, recalls Blake's pre- 
creation visions. Michaelis says to Rhoda : " Be- 
fore creation, beyond time, God not yet risen from 
his sleep, you stand and call to me, and I listen in 
a dream that I dreamed before Eden." Finally, 
Moody's " Death of Eve : A Fragment " probably 
owes a suggestion to Blake's " Ghost of Abel." 

Moody writes with enthusiasm of Blake in his 
" History of English Literature " (pp. 265-6) ; 
mentions him in his " Letters " (autumn, 1895) ; 
and refers to him in his edition of Milton (pp. 100- 
101). "Outwardly Blake led a regular, quiet, 
laborious life," he says in the first, " all the while 
pouring out poems, drawings, and vast ' propheti- 
cal ' books, full of shadowy mythologies and mysti- 
cal thought-systems, which show that his inward 
life was one of perhaps unparalleled excitement 
and adventure. . . In him the whole transcendental 
side of the Romantic movement was expressed by 
hint and implication, though not by accomplish- 
ment." " Four-fifths of William Blake would not 
be accepted for publication by the Harvard Advo- 
cate," he observes in a humorous letter to Josephine 
Preston Peabody; with a note of fellow feeling, 
perhaps, for a romanticist more " floridly extrava- 
gant " than his early self. Finally, by way of con- 
trast and correction, he writes as follows in his 
edition of Milton : " William Blake, in one of 
his prophetical books, says that Milton's house in 
the spiritual kingdom is Palladian, not Gothic. 
Palladian it is, and in this century we have dwelt 
by preference in the Gothic house of mind, loving 
the wayward humor of its adornment, the mys- 
ticism and confusion of its design. But from time 
to time we must purify our vision with the more 
ample and august lines of the house which Milton 
has builded." Wn. CHISLETT, JR.

ANCIENT PEECEDENTS FOE PEESENT-DAY 

POLICIES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In the course of the disputes which led up to the 
Peloponnesian war, a conference was called at 
Sparta. After the injured parties had aired their 
grievances against Athens, certain Athenian envoys 
who chanced to be in Sparta on other business 
addressed the assembly. According to Thucydides, 
they made no attempt to answer the charges 
brought against them by the Megarians and the 
Corinthians. Instead, they recited the leading part 
played by Athens in driving back the barbarian 
(Persian) invaders, and told how an empire had 
come to her as a natural result. " So we have not 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



143 



done anything marvellous or contrary to the dis- 
position of man, in having 1 accepted an empire that 
was offered to us, and not giving it up, influenced 
as we are by the strongest motives, honor, fear, 
and interest ; and when, again, we had not been the 
first to set such a precedent, but it has always 
been a settled rule that the weaker should be con- 
strained by the stronger; and when, at the same 
time, we thought ourselves worthy of it, and were 
thought so by you, until, from calculations of 
expediency, you now avail yourselves of the appeal 
to justice, which no one ever yet brought forward 
when he had a chance of gaining anything by 
might, and abstained from taking advantage." 
(Book I., Sec. 76.) 

War resulted. After it had been in progress for 
several years, the Athenians decided to annex the 
little island of Melos, the only one in the .ZEgean 
Sea, except Thera, not already theirs. Possibly 
this action was due in part to fear that this Dorian 
colony might become the base of Spartan opera- 
tions, and also to the desire for a " scientific 
frontier " ; possibly they desired more lands for 
distribution among Athenian citizens. But more 
weighty than the last-named reason, if we may 
believe Thucydides, was the fear that the indepen- 
dence of Melos might incite the Athenian subjects 
to revolt. Having landed on the island with a 
strong force, they sent ambassadors to demand sub- 
mission. When the Melians demurred, the ambas- 
sadors warned them to " think of getting what you 
can; since you know, and are speaking to those 
who know, that, in the language of men, what is 
right is estimated by equality of power to compel; 
but what is possible is that which the stronger 
practice, and to which the weak submit." The 
Melians trusted that the gods would favor them, 
since they were " standing up in a righteous cause 
against unjust opponents." "As to the gods," re- 
plied the Athenians, " we hold as a matter of opin- 
ion, and as to men we know as a certainty, that in 
obedience to an irresistible instinct they always 
maintain dominion, wherever they are the stronger. 
And we neither enacted this law, nor were the first 
to carry it out when enacted; but having received 
it when already in force, and being about to leave 
it after us to be in force forever, we only avail 
ourselves of it, knowing that both you and others, 
if raised to the same power, would do the same." 
(Book V., Sees. 89, 105.) 

The modern man can only ask, Is this law that 
might makes right realty to be perpetual?

PUBLICATIONS OF THE ILLINOIS STATE 

HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A thin volume of a hundred and thirty-eight 
pages, entitled " Transactions of the Illinois State 
Historical Society, for the year 1913," has recently 
reached me, in which is printed the secretary's 
report, list of officers, and the papers read at the 
annual meeting of the Society. The meeting thus 
reported was held in Springfield, May 15 and 16, 



1913, that is, more than two years ago. It would 
seem reasonable to expect that instead of a delay 
of over two years, the transactions should have 
been published within a few months of the meeting, 
or at least some time within the year in which it 
occurred. 

If this example is followed, the annual meeting 
of May, 1914, will not be reported for another 
year ; and meantime the meeting of May, 1915, has 
taken place, and must wait in its turn until two 
years from the present time before its transactions 
will appear in print. It is difficult to understand 
why these long delays are necessary. What oc- 
curred of importance at the meeting of May, 1914, 
we shall not know for another year, so far as the 
" Transactions " can inform us, and we must 
depend upon other sources of information if we 
should become impatient. Fortunately, the Society 
began in 1908 the publication of a quarterly which 
brings to its friends more recent information, and 
obviates to a certain degree the necessity of rely- 
ing upon the " Transactions." The quarterly, too, 
publishes many contributions not read as papers 
at the annual meetings, and carries out the pur- 
poses of the Society in placing before its readers 
a large amount of historical information. In addi- 
tion, the Society issues from time to time special 
volumes covering subjects the treatment of which 
is too lengthy to be presented as papers in the 
" Transactions " or as contributions to the quar- 
terly. There have been nine such special volumes 
printed since 1903. Before the quarterly began 
publication, the " Transactions " became bulky, 
and the volume for 1904 attained a thickness of 
seven hundred pages, so that the series presents a 
great variety of thick and thin volumes, very dif- 
ferent in appearance from the publications issued 
by the other great historical societies, which gen- 
erally are published in volumes of nearly uniform 
size. 

The value of these publications, in whatever 
form they are printed, is very great; and care in 
their preparation is evident both in the fulness of 
the references and the necessary editing. Indexing 
is carried out thoroughly, and research work by 
students is greatly aided in the consultation of the 
various works. The work of the Illinois Historical 
Society is a monument of painstaking endeavor, 
which should meet the approval of its friends and 
justify the interest shown by the legislators in 
providing for its needs as they have done. 

Returning to the volume of " Transactions " for 
1913, of which mention was made at the beginning 
of this communication, there is something to be 
criticized aside from the long delay in its publica- 
tion. Like all the previous volumes of the series, 
the printing and binding are lacking in the artistic 
finish we might well look for in publications of 
this character. Comparing the publications of the 
Illinois society with those issued, for example, by 
the Mississippi Valley Historical Association, 
where every attention is given to printing, quality 
of paper, etc., it is seen that there is much room 
for improvement in the Illinois publications.

CHRISTIANITY'S FIERCEST ANTAGONIST.* 

The second and concluding volume of the 
life of Nietzsche by his sister, Frau Forster 
Nietzsche, fully sustains the agreeable impres- 
sion made by the earlier book. It is clearly 
and objectively written (we notice only some 
muddle on pp. 147 and 153 as to the date of 
Nietzsche's return to Genoa from Leipzig, 
which actually took place in November, 1882 ) ; 
if a sisterly estimate should sometimes tend 
toward favorable exaggeration, this is indeed 
a venial failing. In fact, the " Life " refrains 
from any critical estimate of the final place of 
Nietzsche's work which, perhaps, is just as 
well: given these plainly-shown facts, they 
can be utilized at some later time. 

The English version is more free and lively 
than that of the first volume. To the eternal 
recurrence of the translation " false pathos " 
for falsches Pathos, which is quite a different 
thing, one has long since become resigned. 

Making all discount for Nietzsche's merely 
pathologic vein, the charm of this artist, phi- 
losopher, and scientist, whose life was devoted 
to brooding on the deepest problems of life, is 
irresistible and perennial: some very sweet 
bells are here jangled. It is comforting to be 
able to moderate the popular impression that 
Nietzsche was a tortured invalid: even in 
1886 he was "completely satisfied with his 
health " ; and although constrained to live in 
rather shabby lodgings or boarding-houses, 
and at times subject to distressing headaches 
and eye-strain, he was at least unusually for- 
tunate in being always free to choose the most 
favorable place for living and working. 

Even Nietzsche's utter loneliness exercises 
the fascination which one feels in the man 
who tenders himself dearly, who painfully 
rends oldtime friendships rather than return 
to the beaten path. The tragic side lay in his 
super-keen sense of the immense cost of it 
all nowhere more than in his feeling for the 
desolation which Would be wrought in human 
relations by blotting out Christianity. "It 
seems so foolish to want to be right at the 
expense of human love " ; "I have no friend, 
no not one, who has the faintest inkling of my 
task " : " in the deeper sense, I have no com- 
rades." This aggressive thinker dropped out 
of the sight of Europe until discovered by 
Brandes, who gave a long series of lectures on 
Nietzsche's philosophy at the University of 
Copenhagen in 1887 and 1888. 

* THE LIFE OF NIETZSCHE. By Frau Forster Nietzsche. 
Translated by Paul V. Cohn. Volume II., The Lonely 
Nietzsche. New York: Sturgis & Walton Co. 



His wonderful creative power is measured 
by the fact that although he was compelled to 
give over almost all reading, his equipment of 
knowledge is lavishly shown on every page, 
often visioning a whole career or epoch in 
one pregnant allusion as in his compact 
characterizations of the seventeenth, eight- 
eenth, and nineteenth centuries in " The "Will 
to Power." " Zarathustra " (" Gelobt sei, was 
hart macht!") was written in a freezing-cold 
room. He was, above all, to be envied for his 
mastering sense of a mission to humanity. As 
early as 1876 he feels called "to restore to 
mankind that repose without which no culture 
can arise or endure " ; "I have more weighty 
matters to think of than my health . . I have 
no more time to lose." This vision of his 
whole future developed rapidly into a relig- 
ious fervor for the improvement of the type 
"Man." 

The life-story is taken up from the time of 
Nietzsche's spiritual breach with Richard 
Wagner in 1876. Bayreuth, which he had 
hoped to find " a universal bath for souls," 
proved merely "one more form of sport for 
the leisured rabble." He considered " the per- 
vading atmosphere of hothouse sensuality" 
the root of evil in Wagner's productions. He 
even attributed the ruin of his own health to 
"that nerve-shattering music." Parsifal, a 
transcription of Wagner's actual Christian 
experience, showed him as " a reviler of life, 
an asserter of Nay." Continued illness led 
Nietzsche, in 1879, to resign the professorship 
at Basel, and with this he turns his back on 
the Greeks as philosophical guides. Thereupon 
began his alien existence in Italy or among the 
high Alps. In 1882 he began the free use of 
chloral as an antidote to depressing sleepless- 
ness, a staff which proved anything but a help 
during the remainder of this unsettled life. 

On the heights of Rapallo, near Genoa, in 
1883 came "my beneficent Yea-assertion," 
"Zarathustra," in such phenomenal bursts of 
creative power that its author spoke of it as a 
direct revelation which transcended free-will. 
In finishing the third part a year later, 
Nietzsche exclaimed : " Who knows how many 
generations must pass before the coming of 
men who can fully realize what I have done ! ' 
Its dark sayings are indeed uttered in parable, 
sometimes in rather revolting imagery, and 
in a style partly borrowed from the minor 
Hebrew prophets) intense as galloping heart- 
beats, with a tonal art described by its creator 
as "the power which enabled him to fly a 
thousand miles beyond all that has hitherto 
been called poetry." This " Bible " of young- 
est Germany makes the sharp division of all 
men into two classes, Commanders and Obey-

ers. Men, inexorable as fate, become Fates 
themselves, and hardness is the supreme nobil- 
ity. Zarathustra, the superman, utters "the 
triumphant paean of the fighter and con- 
queror": to carry out one's own will is the 
only "virtue"; that which " penitential- 
shirted body-haters" decry as "lust" shall 
prove for free hearts the Paradise of earth, 
for lion-willed ones the greatest heart- 
strengthener, the wine of wines ; " domineer- 
ing " shall prove the earthquake shattering all 
that is rotten and hollow ; " selfishness " shall 
prove holy* and wholesome when directed 
against slaves who will not protest for them- 
selves. As a corollary, so-called " virtuous " 
folk are those who have never learned to use 
their, fists, "soft rabbits, ink-fish, pen-driv- 
ers " ; temperance is the mark of mediocrity, 
abstinence is preached by impotence. War 
must be declared on all " small modesties and 
Podunk virtues." " my soul, I have taken 
from thee all servility, all knee-bending, all 
crying ' Lord, Lord ! ' ' The " meek " are the 
priests, the exhausted ones, the woman-souled 
and slave-souled : for these shall come the 
Day, the transformation, the sword of judg- 
ment. 

Much more might be .quoted from this mor- 
bid worship of brute-force on the part of an 
essentially gentle and suffering nature. "Ver- 
ily my maw is the maw of an eagle, for it 
loveth, above all else, the flesh of lambs ! " 
this from a sweet-spirited, finely-grained, pas- 
torate-begotten scholar, whose consideration 
for others was often so exaggerated as to 
amount to an impediment, and who literally 
scorned delights and lived laborious days. 
The doctrine of the " Eternal Recurrence," 
which Nietzsche considered the chief concep- 
tion of " Zarathustra," is so little developed as 
to be negligible. 

" Beyond Good and Evil " (1886) " a school 
for gentlemen and aristocrats," a variation of 
the main theme of " Zarathustra," was contem- 
porary with a small group of corrosive and 
cynical poems. The chief statement of his 
philosophy was held by Nietzsche to be con- 
tained in his "Will to Power" (1888), a long 
collection of fragments in snapped-off Prus- 
sian-Major sentences, differing from the ear- 
lier works mainly in making a direct frontal 
attack upon Christianity (perhaps the fiercest 
assault ever directed against Christian ideals) , 
as the most fatally misleading of all systems 
of falsehood, the chief token of human deca- 
dence, in that it opens the door of happiness 
to the poor in spirit, and has branded natural 
impulses as vices. " I will create a new order 
of higher men, from whom laboring spirits 
and consciences may gain counsel; who live 



beyond political and religious tenets, and 
have even overcome morality." The message 
consists of variations on the theme, "Be an 
egotist." It would bring again to honor the 
words of Plato : " Everyone of us would wish, 
if possible, to be lord over all men." The 
masses suffocate exceptional men, natural 
lords and masters. Let the weaker perish. 
There are no realities back of the old catch- 
words, Christianity, Revolution, Emancipa- 
tion, Equal Rights, Philanthropy, Peace Ad- 
vocacy, Justice, Truth. The work glories in 
militarism, in Bismarck and Bonaparte, as 
loftiest ideals. A great new personality af- 
fects the masses with suspense, fear, and sus- 
picion. In the organic world deceit is highly 
developed in the highest types, and lying is 
one of the chief weapons of superior men. 
The highest joy in life consists in subjugating 
whatever stands in one's way: "all realms 
bordering on our own must be thought of as 
enemies " an ancient sentiment which the 
United States and their Canadian neighbors 
have overlooked for a century. 

The weak now prevail because of " sym- 
pathy"; in two or three generations a race 
easily runs into such riffraff that it develops 
an instinctive opposition to all Privilege the 
very note of true nobility. No ordinary man 
should ever presume to pass judgment on 
what a great man may allow himself and 
vastly more in this vein, leading up to the 
ominous prophecy that "from now on, there 
will be favorable conditions for the develop- 
ment of the great predatory virtues." 

The spring of 1888 found Nietzsche in 
Turin in fairly good health, and delighting 
in the joy of living in that very attractive 
city. Toward the end of the same year ap- 
peared "Ecce Homo" (Nietzsche being the 
" Man " held up to view) , a jumble of saucy 
deliverances upon all sorts of things. He 
knows neither sin nor remorse; too petty for 
his notice are the concepts God, Immortality, 
Salvation. In his reading he returns con- 
tinually to a small number of older French 
writers; he believes only in French civiliza- 
tion, and considers everything else Avhich 
passes under the name of culture in Europe 
as a counterfeit. He decides the Shakespeare- 
Bacon controversy by sheer intellectual grasp 
of the matter ("What care I for the sorry 
chatter of American muddle-heads and low- 
brows?"), in favor of Bacon. He has never 
cared for honors, women, or money. Love in 
its methods is essentially war; in its funda- 
mental nature a deadly hatred between the 
sexes. The last utterance of the book is a 
bitter gust of hostility against the Crucified 
One.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 2 



At the end of 1888 came a paralytic stroke, 
and from this time Nietzsche's writings were 
but the disconnected utterances of a feverish 
patient, though perhaps not so noticeably dif- 
ferent, in form or content, from those which 
preceded this attack. There followed long 
years of helplessness, at first with intermit- 
tent periods of sanity. In 1897 the Weimar 
home (now converted into the beautiful 
Nietzsche-Archiv) was purchased, where 
every kindly ministration was loyally given 
by the devoted sister. After 1899 the invalid 
became gradually weaker, and in the follow- 
ing year the wearied body was laid to rest 
under the shadow of the little church of his 
fathers in Rocken. 

The sheer fascination which Nietzsche exer- 
cises upon his readers derives in no small part 
from his captivating style of writing or, 
rather, his styles. Often a mere trick of 
rhyme (Hohlkopfe: Kohlkropfe), an inciden- 
tal simile, a mint-new epithet ("moraline- 
free virtue"), a smart paradox showing the 
full perversity of epigram : " Is mankind 
made better by civilization ? A comic ques- 
tion, since the opposite is self-evident, and is 
precisely that which is in civilization's favor" ; 
"Virtue remains the most expensive vice." 
He has no dread of repetition, but plays end- 
lessly upon a very few ideas. In his method 
of approach to vital problems, he shows a 
more than Rousseauian ignoring of mere 
facts. He never investigates or collects statis- 
tics, but draws all his sayings from the glow- 
ing depths of his inner soul alone. 

The pathological conditions of an insuffi- 
cient organism account for the rambling 
structure of his works, doubtless as well for 
his sovereign contempt for the world's ac- 
cepted thinkers and scientists, and explain his 
estimate of himself. " Everyone who has had 
intimate relations with me has regarded it as 
an honor and a distinction; I hold the same 
view myself " ; " with this Zarathustra I have 
brought the German language to perfection. 
After Luther and Goethe a third step had to 
be taken " ; " up to now there has been no 
deutsche Kultur"; "before me there never 
was any psychology " ; "I am no man : I am 
dynamite " ; "I have the most varied range 
of styles that a man has ever employed " ; "I 
am now the leading moral thinker and worker 
in Europe." 

It is in direct line with such utterances that 
we constantly meet with a proud sensitiveness 
about "being treated as a person of no ac- 
count." a voracious demand for appreciation. 
There is a constant apprehension of intrigues 
and "influences," of treachery, deceit, mean- 
ness, and spite in short, a whole range of 



concepts such as one never encounters except 
by overhearing in public conveyances on 
Thursday afternoons. A is secretly setting B 
against N; Frau Baumgartner has always to 
warn against the treacherous counsels of Frau 
Overbeck. Old confidences and friendships 
are continually undermined, and give way to 
suspicion and deadliest hatred. The real 
blemish in the biography is that it serves as 
the grosse Wdsche for a mountainous German 
accumulation of household linen, accompanied 
by a lack of reticence which is siinply incredi- 
ble to the Anglo-Saxon. 

Let us, finally, be thankful to Nietzsche for 
his brave formulations : he has given a gallant 
banner to be displayed, and the battle now 
joined between his ideals and those of love 
and tenderness is the real Armageddon, beside 
which all noisy racial, dynastic, and economic 
warfares are merely episodes. We must 
reckon squarely with the conception of "a 
race that will conquer and dominate or die in 
the attempt " ; of the impossibility of culture 
except on a foundation of slavery. We must 
weigh fairly the doctrine, "any society that 
instinctively rejects war and conquest is on 
the decline, and ready for democracy and a 
government by shopkeepers." No confidence 
is betrayed by the present reviewer when he 
remarks that the American consciousness 
stands hopelessly dazed before this philosophy. 
We regard these pinchbeck heroics as of a 
piece with the cubbish exuberance of half- 
grown boys; we wish for this New Gospel a 
swift and decisive collapse : " For the bed is 
shorter than that a man can stretch himself 
on it: and the covering narrower than that 
he can wrap himself in it."

A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY.* 

"If history has any value," says Mr. L. 
Cecil Jane, in his book on " The Interpreta- 
tion of History," " it lies in this, that it sup- 
plies some clue as to what the future will 
bring forth." The business of the historian is 
therefore to "make known the lessons of the 
past, and in doing so to reveal as much as he 
can of the future." But in order to do this in 
a really satisfactory manner one must find, 
first of all, "some underlying factor, in 
accordance with which history may be inter- 
preted and the occurrence of all events ex- 
plained." This underlying factor Mr. Jane 
has discovered in the interplay of the " desire 
to rule and the desire to be ruled." In some

men the desire to rule, in others the desire to 
be ruled, is predominant ; in others still these 
desires alternately obtain the mastery. Na- 
tions, since they are but groups of individuals, 
are likewise actuated by these two desires. 
In respect to internal affairs the desire to rule 
tends to produce self-government, whereas the 
desire to be ruled makes for despotism. In 
respect to external affairs, the desire to rule 
results in a policy of " splendid isolation," of 
national independence, of aggression ; the de- 
sire to be ruled, on the contrary, makes for 
cosmopolitanism, universalism, a common- 
wealth of nations. Curiously enough, or per- 
haps naturally, since nations are as inconsis- 
tent as individuals, " it is frequently, almost 
always, the case that a state which is univer- 
salist in one aspect is individualist in the 
other. An extension of governmental author- 
ity at home is normally coupled with the adop- 
tion of an independent foreign policy; the 
admission of obligations towards foreign 
states is normally accompanied by an asser- 
tion of the rights of the individual citizen as 
against the community." It is to be noted 
that the term universalism is here employed 
in place of the phrase " desire to be ruled," 
while the term individualism replaces the 
phrase " desire to rule." And this practice 
has been followed throughout the book, which 
thus turns out to be a sketch of European 
history, mainly in its political aspects, in 
terms of concepts that are familiar enough but 
which have never before been denned pre- 
cisely as Mr. Jane defines them. 

Those who know something of European 
history, particularly, perhaps, those who do 
not know too much of it, will readily under- 
stand how it is possible, by dint of great 
ingenuity and the resolute ignoring of multi- 
plied difficulties, to sketch the history of the 
western world in accord with these very gen- 
eral ideas. Yet even the friendly critic, one 
who contemplates a new philosophy of history 
with entire equanimity and some little inter- 
est, is disposed to ask how, after all, "the 
occurrence of all events " is " explained " in 
any satisfactory way by such a philosophy as 
Mr. Jane offers. The marriage of Henry 
VIII. with Anne Boleyn was an event, and 
one of some importance. Let us assume I 
confess it seems to me a tremendous assump- 
tion, and one which Mr. Jane does little to 
establish that the dominant motive in hu- 
man action is the desire to rule or to be ruled. 
With this assumption in hand, you can of 
course " explain " Henry's marriage by say- 
ing that in Ensrland, in the year 1533, the 
adjustment of the desire to rule and the desire 
to be ruled was such that this particular event 



was the inevitable result; just as you may 
" explain " it by saying that it was the result 
of a "definite combination of heterogeneous 
changes, both simultaneous and successive, in 
correspondence with external co-existences 
and sequences," or, more simply, "the con- 
tinuous adjustment of internal relations to 
external relations." It must be admitted, 
however, that these " explanations " are some- 
what remote, and I do not see that Spencer's 
formula is more remote than Mr. Jane's. On 
the whole, it seems simpler to say that Henry 
was in love with Anne Boleyn. 

Mr. Jane would doubtless reply that a gen- 
eral formula is not intended to explain par- 
ticular events, such as the marriage of Henry 
VIII., in terms of conscious purpose; the 
value of such a formula, he would insist, is in 
explaining the broader historical movements, 
in relating them to each other, and in furnish- 
ing, through such explanation and relation, a 
" clue to what the future w r ill bring forth." 
Well, one of these broader movements is the 
growth and consolidation of monarchial abso- 
lutism in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- 
turies. In what sense is it an explanation of 
this movement to say that it was the result of 
the desire to be ruled ? Why, one asks at once, 
did the desire to be ruled become so strong at 
this particular time? The answer to this 
question reduces even Mr. Jane to the level 
of the ordinary historian. " The gradual 
progress of the universalist movement may be 
attributed in a measure to the belief that 
despotism had already been established by the 
end of the first half of the seventeenth cen- 
tury; . . the absence of resistance created the 
idea that resistance, or at least successful 
resistance, was impossible." In other words, 
despotism, universally caused by the desire to 
be ruled, was in this particular case caused 
"in a measure" by the belief that resistance 
was useless. Surely, the desire to be ruled is 
not the same as the fear of being punished! 
The truth is that Mr. Jane's formula does not 
explain past events ; what it does is to classify 
events, arbitrarily enough for the most part, 
in certain very general categories. It is 
highly necessary for the historian to classify 
his facts ; but a classification does not explain 
the origin of events, and is only the pre- 
liminary step in their interpretation. 

If Mr. Jane's formula does not enable him 
to explain the past, neither does it enable him 
to predict the future; it enables him to say 
only that the future will be like the past, a 
succession of periods of which universalism 
and individualism will alternately be the pre- 
dominant characteristic. At present, that is to 
say in the spring of 1914, when the book was 



148 



THE DIAL 



[ Sept. 2 



written, it is " clear that . . the desire to be 
ruled prevails rather the desire to rule." It 
follows, therefore, that " if human nature re- 
mains constant in its fundamental character- 
istic, an individualist reaction, both internally 
and externally, may be anticipated with confi- 
dence." At the risk of being set down as a 
carping critic, one must say that this, as a 
prediction of the future, is extremely vague; 
it reminds one of the phrase about the pendu- 
lum, which is alleged to swing first in one 
direction and then in another and opposite 
direction. M. Jules Cambon, writing from 
Berlin in 1913, unaided, I suppose, by any 
philosophy of history, was a much better 
prophet than Mr. Jane himself, writing a year 
later from Oxford. No, Mr. Jane does not 
predict the future any more than he explains 
the past; he merely projects into the future 
the categories which have been used to classify 
the facts of the past, in the confident expecta- 
tion that future events, when they occur, may 
be pressed, without too much difficulty, into 
these categories. 

One may ask in conclusion whether the 
value of history is what Mr. Jane supposes 
it to be, whether it consists in furnishing 
" some clue as to what the future will bring 
forth." This is, I think, a fundamental error, 
and one which springs from a vicious confu- 
sion of the physical and the moral world. 
Why, it is asked, since the scientist, by 
means of classification and experiment, can 
predict the action of the physical world, shall 
not the historian do as much for the moral 
world ? The analogy is false at many points ; 
but the confusion arises chiefly from the as- 
sumption that the scientist can predict the 
action of the physical world. Certain con- 
ditions precisely given, the scientist can pre- 
dict the result ; he cannot say when or where 
in the future those conditions will obtain. 
Desiring to gain control over nature, the scien- 
tist is little concerned with any actual con- 
crete situation, whereas the historian, aiming 
to appropriate the experience of the past for 
himself and his fellows, is concerned precisely 
with the concrete human world, not as it 
might be under certain conditions but as it 
has actually been. The difference is radical. 
It is for this reason that although scientific 
knowledge, through its formulae, can be prac- 
tically applied, to the great benefit of all 
men, knowledge of history cannot be thus 
practically applied, and is therefore worth- 
less except to those who have made it, in 
greater or less degree, a personal possession. 
The value of history is, indeed, not scientific 
but moral : by liberalizing the mind, by deep- 
ening the sympathies, by fortifying the will, 



it enables us to control, not society, but our- 
selves, a much more important thing; it 
prepares us to live more humanely in the pres- 
ent and to meet rather than to foretell the 
future. CARL BECKER. 



ESSAYS ix MINIATURE.* 



Mr. Charles Leonard Moore is a writer who 
needs no introduction to the readers of this 
journal. For a score of years, his nicely 
weighed and admirably judicious essays in 
miniature upon literary topics have been one 
of our outstanding features ; and even before 
Mr. Moore had become one of our regular con- 
tributors, we directed attention to him as a 
poet. The two sonnets from his " Book of Day 
Dreams" which we then reprinted (March 1, 
1893) still seem to us, as they did at that 
time, to reach the hi gh- water mark of Amer- 
ican poetical achievement. Of Mr. Moore's 
DIAL essays, thirty-nine have now been col- 
.lected into a volume entitled "Incense and 
Iconoclasm," and offer as many examples of 
the art of saying a great deal within the limits 
of a narrow space. The " thirty-nine articles " 
of this literary confession of faith touch upon 
most of the major themes of literary criti- 
cism, and are notable for their broad views, 
their penetrative sympathy, and their method 
of direct approach to the very hearts of their 
respective subjects. 

The qualifications of a good critic of litera- 
ture are so many that we would not venture to 
say that Mr. Moore has them all ; but he un- 
doubtedly has the one that is fundamental, the 
one without which good taste and sound judg- 
ment and an agile intellect will not be found 
to constitute salvation. The trouble with the 
greater part of what passes for literary criti- 
cism in this age of superficial ad captandum 
writing is that its authors do not know enough 
about literature. This defect in their equip- 
ment may become fatal at any moment; and 
even when the pitfalls in the path are skil- 
fully avoided, maundering is likely to take the 
place of precision of aim, the clear stream of 
thought is likely to grow muddied with sub- 
jective intrusions, and the rational objective 
pronouncement gives way to the exhibition of 
the writer's own mental processes. Like the 
Oxus, which, for lack of sufficient initial vol- 
ume and impetus, loses itself in " beds of sand 
and matted rushy isles," this kind of writing 
misses the final point of criticism, and pro- 
vides bewilderment instead of guidance. Ac- 
quaintance with, say, the " Kalevala " and

" The Canterbury Tales " does not seem to 
have anything to do with the function of the 
reviewer of a modern novel; but it really 
exercises a pervasive influence upon the per- 
formance of his task. Those who will not 
recognize this fact have precisely the type of 
mind which denies the "practicality" of the 
time-honored intellectual disciplines which 
have to struggle for their lives in our educa- 
tional systems. 

Mr. Moore's volume borrows its title from 
the first of the essays included ; but the author 
takes the side of the angels throughout, the 
only iconoclasm in which he indulges being the 
smashing of those idols of the literary market- 
place which draw to their worship the short- 
sighted and the uninformed. He stands for 
the eternal values in literature rather than 
for the temporal trivialities, and has a proper 
scorn for the catchwords of the hour. " In 
the end the classics emerge," he reminds us; 
and, " taking the whole roll of time, it is not 
difficult to see what are the prime and what 
are the secondary qualities of art." In fact, 
he might have taken for the text of his entire 
volume Professor Shorey's address on " The 
Unity of the Human Spirit." in the volume of 
" Representative Phi Beta Kappa Orations," 
from which we quoted in our last issue. 

Profusely scattered through Mr. Moore's 
pages are passages of excellent pith, of which 
a few examples may be given. Emerson " is a 
veritable quicksand of an author," and his 
felicitous phrasings " are the tiniest and most 
fragmentary crystals ever produced by a con- 
siderable poet, but they flash with the white 
light of the diamond." Whitman "has tried 
to get the whole universe into his brain, and 
in a manner has succeeded, only it has turned 
back into chaos." "Moliere was the com- 
posite smile of mankind." " In a nation of 
graceful writers, [Balzac] is the dancing bear 
of prose." "Man's Eden without Eve would 
be a dirty place, full of tobacco smoke." Mil- 
ton " is going to justify the works of God to 
man but in the end he comes near justify- 
ing the devil." " Music is a language that has 
only two words joy and grief." These 
aphorisms, and many others of like quality, 
show us that it is possible to be epigrammatic 
without being inane. 

But Mr. Moore is not without his examples 
of sustained thought. Probably the best illus- 
tration of his application of analytical powers 
to the development of a considerable argu- 
ment is to be found in the group of four essays 
which examine " The Root Ideas of Fiction," 
which are Identity, Hunger, Love, and Death. 
From the last of these essays we must make an 
extract. 



" I have no desire to add a page to Drelincourt 
on Death. But impatience consumes one at our 
modern attitude to the great, serious, and tragic 
themes of thought and art. Especially does our 
American hedonism, our love of pleasure, our fear 
of pain or shock, rebel at the best and highest in 
literature. We grasp at the shallow criticism which 
speaks of the pessimistic, the melancholy, the 
gloomy, as the minor note. Even in music, from 
which this term is borrowed, it is not true that 
melancholy themes or notes which excite sad im- 
pressions are secondary. Most of the great sym- 
phonies, oratorios, requiems, are sad and stormy 
and terrible. And the same conditions are so plain 
in literature that a critic must apologize for point- 
ing it out. But, our childish readers say, there is 
enough that is painful and shocking and terrible in 
life, why reiterate it in literature? Wordsworth 
prayed for frequent sights of what is to be borne. 
We do not acquire fortitude by running away from 
danger, and a literature of lollipops is not likely to 
make a strong race. The tragic part of literature 
is the most tonic and most inspiring." 

Mr. Moore has no patience with the cult of 
modernity which calls upon literature to break 
away from the moorings of the past, and con- 
demns writers who turn for inspiration to the 
old forms and models. He knows the funda- 
mental truth that modernity is to be tested by 
the spirit or the temper, and not by the frame- 
work, and that the oldest of old-world themes 
may serve as its vehicle, as, for example, in 
the cases of Shelley's " Prometheus Unbound " 
and Moody's " The Fire-Bringer," which are 
intensely modern poems, despite their mytho- 
logical investiture. 

" Practically, the great artists of literature who 
have brooded deepest over life have affected the 
distant or the past for their creations. They were 
not foolish enough to doubt that human life is 
always essentially the same; they did not really 
believe in any Age of Gold, or Day of the Gods. 
But they knew that to evolve tragedy, romance, 
poetry, they must get away from the garish light of 
their own hour.' 1 

And this lesson is thus homiletically enforced : 
" Let us deal kindly with tradition, and tradition 
will be good to us. Let us not try to push our 
grandsires from their thrones. Rather, if it is 
necessary to save them, let us bear them tenderly 
out as the pious ./Eneas carried old Anchises from 
the wreck of burning Troy." 

The modernist is merely the victim of a 
huge delusion, and it may be shrewdly sus- 
pected that his bankruptcy goes back to the 
old difficulty of not knowing enough about 
literature. Youths of both sexes just out of 
college write glibly and blithely about prod- 
ucts of the contemporary imagination, and 
every paragraph of what they say betrays a 
naive ignorance of the natural history of the 
ideas and the literary forms which they are 



150 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 2 



with such innocent confidence discussing. 
The thing they never see is the thing which 
Mr. Moore states with apposite force in the 
following words : 

" Yet the fact remains that nothing in our recent 
output is new. In spite of the contortions and 
struggles of our novelists and playwrights and 
poets to be strong, to be daring, to be extreme, there 
is nothing that they utter which will compare in 
these qualities with much of the literature of the

Mr. Wells's later novels are mere doves compared 
with the people in Fielding and Smollett and the 
Restoration comedy." 

And so it goes, as Mr. Moore continues to 
illustrate in much detail, with the other 
themes and inventions hailed as novelties in 
most of the uninformed chatter that passes 
for literary criticism in this impatient age. 

We have marked many other passages for 
quotation, but the limitations of space forbid 
their reproduction. Let us close with the 
author's generalized comment on the "turn 
downward " of our recent literature, and with 
his plea for the utmost freedom for the artist. 
The plaint is thus stated: Literature "has 
largely exchanged verse for prose ; it has min- 
gled with the crowd on the levels, instead of 
staying with the shining ones on the hill; it 
has dealt very exclusively with the passive 
peculiarities of women, rather than with the 
active energies of men." And the plea is thus 
voiced : 

" Readers of sense know very well how to 
discriminate. They are furnished with feelers, 
antennae, by which they can separate what is prac- 
tical from the divine make-believe of literature. 
They are not going to commit murder because they 
can thrill with the spectacle of Macbeth's guilt. 
They are not going to filch purses because they can 
enjoy the humour of FalstafP s exploit at Gadshill. 
They are not going to bolt with the first pleasing 
person of the other sex, because Cleopatra or 
Camille is dear to them. They accept imaginative 
literature as a vicarious experience, which enlarges 
their minds, deepens their emotions, makes them 
contemporaries of all times, citizens of all places. 
They are willing to allow to the artist the utmost 
li 1 erty of his materials if he can only make some- 
thing of them " 

If the " turn downward " of which Mr. Moore 
speaks, is to be checked, we must assume a less 
tolerant attitude toward the vagaries of our 
younsr radicals, and insist more sternly upon 
the standards which they affect to despise.

OUR SOUTH AMERICAN NEIGHBORS.* 



In recent years, Latin America has been re- 
discovered by interested Anglo-Americans. 
But not all the travellers find the same things. 
As a rule, American accounts of our Latin 
neighbors to the south are complimentary; 
and we have about decided that Spain as a 
colonizer was not so bad, and that her off- 
spring states in the western w r orld are rapidly 
and hopefully moving along the highway of 
modern civilization. But Dr. Edward A. 
Ross's new book, " South of Panama," is, with 
regard to much of South America, quite pessi- 
mistic. The author's object is, in part, to 
show how unlike ourselves the Latin Ameri- 
cans are, and how difficult it is, in several 
states, for them to make any real progress. 
He describes much that is good and sound in 
Argentina and Chile; but in these and other 
states he finds that modern civilization is hin- 
dered because of complexities of race, social 
and economic conditions, climatic influences, 
and lack of sound political capacity. 

The author began his travels at Panama, 
and went down through the West Coast coun- 
tries, coming back through Argentina. There 
are good descriptive chapters on the regions 
through which he passed, and more valuable 
studies of the Native Races, Labor Conditions, 
Caste and Class, Morals, Character, Religion 
and the Church, Education, Politics and Gov- 
ernment. 

The descriptions are always vivid and inter- 
esting. For example, in his account of Cali, 
in Colombia, Dr. Ross says : 

" The life of the town revolves about the river 
that comes tumbling down from among the hills. 
Every bright day nearly the whole adult popula- 
tion bathe in it. From a single point one may see 
hundreds in the various operations. Gentlemen 
with white linen and black coats strip beside the 
negro muleteer and the swarthy peon. The pretty 
girl disrobes beside the coal-black negress with a 
cigar between her lips. Every tree and bush yields 
fancied protection. Behind their large sheet-towels 
men and women undress not fifteen yards from 
one another, while lads and lasses splash about in 
the same pool. The men wear a napkin about the 
loins, the women a red calico Mother Hubbard, 
which when wet, discloses the form with startling 
fidelity. More leveling even than the bathing 
beach, the river reveals to his fellow citizens, al- 
most in puribus, the portly judge, the grizzled 
municipal councilor or the skinny banker. But no 
one stares or is self-conscious, and the proprieties 
are strictly observed. Still, some deplore this Arca- 
dian daily dip and point out that only two children 
out of five in Cali have been born in wedlock." 

And of Valparaiso at night, he writes: 

* SOUTH OF PANAMA. By Edward Alsworth Ross, Ph.D., 
LL.D. New York : The Century Co. 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



151 



" The night view of Valparaiso from the bal- 
conies of the cliff dwellers is one of the great 
sights of the world. The vast sickle of the shore 
lit for nearly two hundred thousand people, the 
scores of ocean vessels lying at anchor, the harbor 
lights, the glowing avenues below from which rises 
mellow the roar of nocturnal traffic, the rippling 
water under the moonlight and the far horizon of 
the illimitable Pacific produce an effect of enchant- 
ment." 

It is the author's belief that much of the 
backwardness of South America is due to the 
inheritance of evil conditions from the Span- 
ish colonial regime, "it is the victim of a 
l3ad start." But other conditions weigh down 
upon these societies. There are too few whites 
except in Argentina ; there is too little educa- 
tion; in politics and government the people 
are " poor losers " ; there is a general lack of 
persistence and an inability to cooperate; 
work is too frequently despised ; truthfulness 
is too rare a virtue ; morals are loose ; distrust 
is general in business and politics; the lower 
classes seem hopelessly without ambition; 
sanitation is unheard of; little value is at- 
tached to time ; there is in most states no flow 
of immigration which might stimulate and 
elevate the present populations; women have 
little influence, and society is " androcentric." 
These hindrances to progress are less in evi- 
dence in the south than in the north ; in par- 
ticular, Argentina appears to be much freer 
of them than any other state. 

Life is monotonous nearly everywhere, and 
is filled with trivialities. Gossip, visiting, 
drinking, revolutions help to pass the time. 
The author suggests that " the passion of these 
people for politics is due in part to the un- 
ventfulness of their lives." For young 
Americans and other foreigners the environ- 
ment is deadening, nothing to do, no whole- 
some amusements, no one suitable to marry. 
And the same is true of the South American 
who goes abroad for education. 

" It is pathetic to see how girls educated in a 
Quebec or New York convent return to Cali with a 
resolve not to sink into this listless, indolent way, 
but to ' start something,' give a garden party or 
lawn fete, make a real social life. But the system 
is too strong for the poor things. They are steam- 
rolled by the church and by the established social 
customs. After a while, broken in spirit, they cease 
to struggle, sink into acquiescence, and become just 
as narrow in interests and pursuits as the women 
who have never been out of the valley." 

Argentina excepted, the state organization 
is of, by, and for the small upper class. For 
them are the governmental positions, and for 
them only is the education necessary to fit one 
for a position. Manual labor is despised, and 
a long nail on the little finger is evidence of 



higher respectability than calloused palms. 
With inherited Spanish fondness for town 
life, those who can do so stay in the larger 
centres, leaving the country to the lower class 
laborers and the overseers. As a result, " from 
the Rio Grande down the West Coast to Cape 
Horn, free agricultural labor as we know it 
does not exist." Government expenditures 
are made mainly upon the towns and cities. 
Of public life in general, Dr. Ross says : 

" One who looks for good popular government 
in tropical South America would expect to gather 
grapes from thorns and figs from thistles. Take, 
for example, Bolivia. . . There are a few men of 
character, ability and education, who are working 
together for definite public ends. . . But this bit 
of leaven is too small in relation to the lump to be 
leavened. Men of broad outlook and high firm 
character are too few. They lack following and 
support. With us the moral and intellectual peaks 
rise from a plateau; in the Bolivian people they 
rise from the plain. The Indians are exploited, 
helpless and inert, and practically nothing is being 
done to elevate them. The cholos are bigoted and 
egotistic, of very little worth either intellectual or 
moral, and they show few signs of improvement." 

The best society suffers from being too 
" androcentric." Here the male dominates 
all; girls and women stay at home in seclu- 
sion, although as a rule they are brighter and 
more intellectual than the males of their own 
class, who are exposed to various dissipations. 
The upper class family is clanlike in its close- 
ness and in its size, but family discipline is 
lax. Generally speaking, manners are very 
good, but "altruism scarcely exists." The 
mistress of the house takes little interest in 
the housekeeping, which is left to incompe- 
tent servants. The Church is supported and 
to an extent controlled by the State, a fact 
that probably prevents wholesome outside 
forces from working for the elevation of 
standards among clergy and people. The 
women and lower classes are generally relig- 
ious after a fashion, but " few men who wear 
coats go to confession." 

But Dr. Ross does not paint always with a 
sooty brush. He has much to say of healthy 
forces here and there, and signs of progress. 
The churches and the schools are improving 
slowly. A middle class is developing in 
Chile. White immigration to the highlands 
of the northern states may result in develop- 
ment and stability. While there is not an 
intellectual democracy, the enlightened elite 
is increasing in numbers. The best country, 
the author thinks, is Argentina, "a white 
man's country," with a more favorable geog- 
raphy, many immigrants, a better population, 
and open-minded leaders.

[Sept. 2 



BELGIUM'S POET-LAUREATE.* 

Those who hope for the ultimate triumph 
of the Allies will find encouragement in 
Stefan Zweig's study of Emile Verhaeren. 
The book is in no sense a biography, but an 
exposition of the intellectual and moral evolu- 
tion of the poet. He appears as one who, in 
Maeterlinck's words, " represents worthily 
that which is great and heroic in a people." 
The epigraph of the essay might be the lines 
quoted at the head of the third chapter : 

" Je suis le fils de cette race 

Tenace, 

Qui veut, apres avoir voulu 
Encore, encore et encore plus." 

Verhaeren 's attitude toward life is constantly 
compared to that of "Walt Whitman; but he 
worked out his philosophy independently, and 
has apparently succeeded better than the 
American poet in voicing the ideals of his 
own people. The peasants among whom he 
spent his early years regard him as one of 
themselves, and he is as much at home among, 
them as in the great world where his fame has 
led him. 

Stefan Zweig, an Austrian poet, the dis- 
ciple and translator of Verhaeren, has given 
a sympathetic and perhaps at times over- 
laudatory history of his master's thought, 
from "Les Flamandes" (1883) to "Les Bles 
Mouvants" (1913). His book, admirably 
translated by Mr. Bithell, would have made 
its mark at any time, and has now gained a 
poignant interest from the European cata- 
clysm. For Verhaeren is par excellence the 
singer of our time in all its complexity. He 
has wrung poetry from the most unpromising 
subjects, and created by sheer force of will a 
Utopia out of the most prosaic reality. His 
present disillusion can only be the more bitter. 
In the face of the disaster that confronts 
humanity to-day, Zweig's opening hymn to the 
new age assumes a ghastly irony. If "now 
in the very air man is building a new road 
from country to country " it is with the intent 
to destroy alike the priceless monuments of 
the past and the latest achievements of human 
industry. "Who will still dare to say "only 
eternal earth has changed not nor grown 
older"? For what of the bestial substratum 
of human nature which Kultur has only 
aggravated, and which is to-day befouling the 
centre of the world's civilization by outrages 
that only primeval savages were deemed capa- 
ble of imaging? And must not the muse

become a mere henchman of the Kaiser if we 
accept Zweig's dictum that " only that poet 
can be necessary to our time who feels that 
everything in this time is necessary, and there- 
fore beautiful"? We shall not have long to 
wait for Vertiaeren's poetic judgment of the 
beauty of the necessity of the rape of his 
country by Germany. Beauty there is, even 
in the terrible events of to-day, but it is the 
world-old beauty of the heroism and self- 
sacrifice of individuals and nations for an 
idea ; in the diabolic modern ingenuity in the 
creation of strange images of death, there is 
only hideousness. 

Yet the age on which the iron fist of mili- 
tarism has set its ghastly seal had its poetry 
in the overflow of energy, even though for the 
moment that energy is at the service of the 
iron fist. Verhaeren's greatness lies in having 
seized and crystallized that poetry. His joy- 
ous acceptance of life in all its manifestations, 
which was to lead him at last to a lyric panthe- 
ism, is shown to be an inheritance from his 
race ; for the Belgians are pictured as possess- 
ing to a higher degree than any other people 
a delight in every exercise of intoxicating 
activity. The most heroic exploit in their his- 
tory, previous to 1914, their revolt from 
Spain, is explained as a struggle against the 
ascetic Puritanism of Philip II., who would 
have curtailed their free dionysiac enjoyment. 

Thus the reader is prepared for the brief 
but charming sketch of Verhaeren's youth in 
Flanders. We see him first in the Jesuit col- 
lege of Sainte-Barbe at Ghent, where he met 
Maeterlinck. The fathers w r ould have saved 
their young pupils from the world by making 
them priests, and endeavored to inspire in 
them a profound respect for the past, with a 
hatred of all innovation. Verhaeren carried 
away a lasting sentiment of the heroism of 
the monastic life and its poetry ; but his wild 
nature could not be cramped within cloistral 
walls. Zweig suggests that the chief result 
of this early training was to turn the poet's 
lust of life away from material things toward 
science and art. " The priest they sought to 
make of him he has really become, only he has 
preached everything that they proscribed, and 
fought against everything that they praised." 
After the school at Sainte-Barbe, Verhaeren 
studied law at Lou vain, where, urged by his 
fiery blood, he threw himself into carousals of 
which he still tells with glee. Admitted to the 
bar at Brussels, he joined a coterie of young 
artists, and, like Gautier, he won a name for 
shocking the bourgeois by fantastic freaks 
of dress and conduct. His unpublished juve- 
nilia, written at this time in imitation of 
Lamartine and Victor Hugo, are nevertheless

in "immaculate Alexandrines." Finally he 
threw aside the barrister's gown forever, and 
turned to poetry as his vocation. 

His first published work, destined to. con- 
found his friends and the critics, was "Les 
Flamandes." Written under the influence of 
Le Monnier, the interpreter in Belgium of 
Zola's naturalism, the book aims at trans- 
planting naked reality into verse. With de- 
liberate purpose the author discards in these 
sketches of old Flanders all that is sentimental 
or romantic, all that is conventionally known 
as poetry, and gives pictures of primitive bru- 
tality. " Barbarian," shouted the critics ; and 
Zweig finds something " genuinely barbarous, 
ravage with Teuton strength," in Verhaeren's 
nature. His inspiration is Rabelaisian : he 
possesses the fiery blood of Rubens and Jor- 
daens. And yet he still keeps the traditional 
Alexandrine mould. 

Another side of Belgian life is portrayed in 
the poet's next work, "Les Moines," an echo 
of his early education. As in "Les Flam- 
andes" he had sung of the lusty youths and 
maidens of the kermesses of yesteryear, he 
now celebrates the peaceful life of the monks 
in the manner of the older Flemish painters. 
Before writing this book he had spent three 
weeks at Forges with the fathers, who in their 
simple piety initiated him into their holy of 
holies with the hope of winning him for the 
priesthood. But his attitude was rather that 
of aesthetic admiration than of devout wor- 
ship. He hails the monks as undaunted cham- 
pions of a lost cause, and the beauty of their 
sacrifice is intensified for him as being a relic 
of the past. In studied Parnassian sonnets 
he portrays the various aspects of this calm 
life, and the contrasting characters more or 
less subdued by a common discipline. Here 
is the first effort at psychological analysis. 
Verhaeren's development is always toward the 
discovery of the inner meaning of the alle- 
gorical sense of external phenomena. Hence 
his welcome of scientific and mechanical prog- 
ress as matter for poetry. 

Zweig notes the pictorial character of both 
the early collections. " Monks," says he, " are 
for Verhaeren heroic symbols of mighty 
periods in the past," and he adds that the 
poet " seemed obliged to exhaust both the his- 
torical styles before he could reach his own, 
the modern style." 

Yet though both volumes show a distinct 
harking back to the past in quest of beauty, 
for which reason Verhaeren has repudiated 
them, we must still note the essential realism. 
Before writing "Les Flamandes" the poet 
liad caroused at kermesses which imitated as 
best they could the ancient festivals; early 



education and the visit to Forges inspired 
" Les Moines." It is always a real world that 
he invokes, even in his effort to escape from 
actuality. 

After "Les Moines" comes a period of 
storm and stress a nervous breakdown 
brought on by the supersensitiveness of the 
poetic temperament. Of this experience Ver- 
haeren has left a record in the trilogy, "Les 
Soirs," " Les Debacles," and " Les Flambeaux 
Noirs." Here we have the poet playing the 
role of the naturalistic novelist, with himself 
as the subject. He dissects his diseased mind 
and emotions as a surgeon a specimen in the 
operating room. Zweig's phrase is here vigor- 
ous, if not altogether happy: Verhaeren has 
" immortalized in poems the process of the 
inflammation of his nerves." Zweig follows 
him through all the stages of this crisis, first 
physical, then psychic illness nearly ending 
in madness. A couple of citations may suffice 
to show the tenor of the whole. The poet is in 
London and sees the corpse of his reason float- 
ing down the Thames. A similar phenome- 
non is noted by George Brandes among the 
early German romanticists. He calls it " dis- 
integration of the ego." Verhaeren writes : 

" Elle [ma raison] est morte de trop savoir, 
De trop vouloir sculpter la cause." 

Or again : " Je veux marcher vers la folie et 
ses soleils." Here is the Ultima Thule of 
decadent romanticists. It is the instinct 
among them which inspired Joubert's defini- 
tion, "chercheurs de delire." Although the 
volumes contain spirited verse, many readers 
will not accept Zweig's enthusiastic judgment 
that the poet's analysis of his crisis possesses 
monumental value. 

But Verhaeren was too sturdy to remain 
long in these mazes of subjectivity. Like 
Goethe, he frees himself from excess of pas- 
sion by giving it artistic expression in symbols. 

" The poet has torn his fear, his burning, moan- 
ing, horrible fear, out of himself, and poured it 
into his bell-ringer, who is consumed in his blazing 
belfry. He has turned the monotony of his days to 
music in his poem of the rain; his mad fight 
against the elements, which in the end break his 
strength, he has shaped into the image of the 
ferryman struggling against the current that shat- 
ters his oars one after the other." 

The pendulum has swung again, and the man 
who would hold himself apart and see all in 
the terms of his own personality throws him- 
self with open arms into the cosmic life to 
refind himself. "Nothing human is alien to 
me," becomes his motto, and he hails with a 
renewed joy every manifestation of the energy 
and aspiration that characterize his genera- 
tion. For him this alone is poetry, this the 



154 



THE DIAL 



[ Sept. 2 



music of the spheres to-day. Immense cities, 
which had formerly been anathema to him, 
furnish the most striking example of this 
united energy, and he finds poetry in the 
very force by which they suck the blood of 
the country. So we have another trilogy, 
" Les Campagnes Hallucinees," " Les Villages 
Illusoires, and "Les Villes Tentaculaires." 
In the assembly of vast multitudes of men all 
moved by a common instinct, the race for 
power, whether by the acquisition of money or 
science, Verhaeren would see the breakdown 
of national barriers and the formation of a 
cosmic consciousness bent on the concentra- 
tion of human energy. This Utopian ideal he 
has expressed in his symbolistic drama, "Les 
Aubes." 

His verse form, too, has changed. During 
his storm and stress he had found the vers 
libre, stanzas of irregular lines ; and into the 
later poems the rhythm of all the gigantic 
industry of modern life has entered. Herein 
lies his appeal to all manner of men. His work 
is filled with what Zweig calls "the new" 
pathos," which at once mirrors and inspires 
the passion of his hearers. 

In Verhaeren's latest work another change 
is to be marked. This singer of force, of uni- 
versal energy working with common interest 
toward cosmic progress, finds a higher ideal 
still, the union of humanity by universal 
love and admiration which joins men in their 
common purpose and musters individuals and 
nations into a common cause, the striving 
for the onward march of life. " II faut aimer 
pour decouvrir avec genie " is the note of his 
mature work. We need not wonder if his bit- 
terness knows no bounds to-day. He has 
chanted the triumph of life, and now the can- 
* non, mouthpieces of the modern quest of 
power, are pealing back the triumph of death. 

Aside from his lyric work and yet a part of 
it a synthesis of it are his dramas, in 
which prose and verse stand side by side, 
prose for the groundwork, lyric for ecstasy. 
Of course they are closet dramas, perhaps too 
crowded with symbolically expressed ideas for 
complete success on the stage. "Le Cloitre" 
recalls the early collection of sonnets, "Les 
Moines." The monks are presented as all 
striving for the prior's chair a symbol of 
the greatest fitness to serve God. The one 
chosen believes himself unworthy because of 
an early crime which he confesses to his breth- 
ren, to the people, and to the judicial authori- 
ties. The Catholic doctrine of expiation by 
confession furnishes here strikingly dramatic 
crises at least. "Les Aubes" shows Oppido- 
magnum besieged by paupers and outcasts. 



The tribune Herenien secretly admits the 
enemy into the city, not as the act of a traitor 
but with the conviction that goodness over- 
comes strife. He falls the first martyr to his 
ideal, but the cause is won. In " Philip II.," 
Verhaeren pictures the. Spanish monarch as. 
Antichrist, for he has blasphemed against the 
spirit of life. " Helene de Sparte," which 
more nearly conforms to dramatic require- 
ments, is the tragedy of a woman afflicted by 
excessive beauty. She is tormented by the 
desires of men, which she kindles against her 
will. Snatched from one lover to another, the 
cause of innumerable crimes, a bane to ships 
and men and cities and most of all to herself^ 
she finds refuge only in death. " I have seen 
the flaring of so many flames that now I love 
only the hearth's glow and the lamp," is her 
plaintive cry. 

It is characteristic of Verhaeren that the 
spirit of a play even about Helen should be 
anti-erotic. Zweig suggests that one cause of 
the inadequate appreciation among the great 
public of his dramas is the absence of insis- 
tence on amorous passion. There is not a sin- 
gle woman in the caste of "Le Cloitre." Ver- 
haeren is one of the most masculine of lyrie 
poets: his appeal is rather to action and the 
exercise of the intelligence and will than to 
pity. Sex-instinct he has never taken as a 
serious problem. Its gratification is a matter 
of course in the life of vigorous manhood ab- 
sorbed in intellectual pursuits. All his love 
poems are addressed to a single woman, his 
wife. "Les Heures Claires," "Les Heures 
d'Apres-midi," " Les Heures du Soir " form a 
striking contrast both in diction and sentiment 
with the frequently rough and almost brutal 
tone of the rest of his work. Written in 
maturity, they speak with gentle simplicity of 
a great and lasting passion. " Je te regarde 
et tous les jours je te decouvre" is the key- 
note. " Oh la tendresse des forts ! " exclaims 
one critic in wondering admiration. 

We have already said that the translation 
of Zweig's book is admirably done. One never 
realizes that it is a translation at all. It 
might have been written as it stands by an 
English poet, with a mind more given to 
metaphysics than most of them are. That the 
author is himself a poet no one can doubt. 
Even in its English dress the style is that of 
poetry; figures abound on every page, and a 
poet's conception of the greatness of his role 
permeates the book from cover to cover. 
Zweig has cited generously : the passages are 
well chosen both as illustration and to inspire 
a desire in the reader for further acquain- 
tance with Verhaeren's work. The translator 
has wisely left these quotations in the original.

The book ends with a bibliography citing edi- 
tions, criticisms, and English translations of 
Verhaeren. 

Those who wish for a brief but excellent 
selection of Verhaeren 's work in metrical 
translation will welcome the new edition of 
Miss Alma Strettell's " Poems of Emile Ver- 
haeren." The book contains a reproduction 
of Sargent's portrait of the author, a brief bio- 
graphical notice, and English renderings of 
a score of poems chosen from " Les Villages 
Illusoires," "Les Heures Claires," "Les Ap- 
parus dans mes Chemins," and "La Multiple 
Splendeur." Thus, striking examples of the 
poet's middle period (1891-1906), with three 
representative poems of his mature work, are 
included. 

The translations are executed with no little 
technical skill ; one can hear, for instance, the 
dull monotony of the rain almost as well in 
the English as in the French of " La Pluie " : 

" Long as unending threads, the long-drawn rain 
Interminably, with its nails of grey, 
Athwart the dull grey day, 
Rakes the green window-pane 
So infinitely, endlessly, the rain, 
The long, long rain, 

The rain." 

The variety of the selections is also note- 
worthy. One finds descriptions of nature such 
as " The Snow," landscapes such as " The 
Silence," symbolic pieces dramatic in move- 
ment such as "The Bell-Ringer" or "The 
Ferryman," love poems impassioned in their 
simplicity, and finally the inspiring vision of 
Saint George, of which the courageous note 
rings out again in one of the last poems in the 
collection, " Life " : 

" To march, thus intrepid in confidence, straight 
On the obstacle, holding the stubborn hope stiU 
Of conquering, thanks to firm blows of the will, 
Of intelligence prompt, or of patience to wait; 
And to feel growing stronger within us the sense, 
Day by day, of a power superb and intense."

Church ancilla domini; and the leaders in 
ecclesiastical advance and development have 
known how to appreciate what this alluring 
coadjutor in the sacred service has done for 
them. Dr. Newton's volume is an enlarge- 
ment of two discourses delivered some years 
ago; but the thought of the author has 
deepened and clarified with the lapse of time, 
and we have here his mature and thoroughly 
considered utterance. 

" Music, as we know it, was born into the world 
in the age of science. It is the art of the age of 
knowledge. We need not, then, be surprised to 
find that music is not an art merely, that it is a 
science as well. This which is true of all arts, is 
pre-eminently true of music. It is intellectual as 
well as emotional. It deals with thoughts as much 
as with feelings. Its contents are ideas. Mu- 
sicians are measured in the scale of music by their 
intellectuality. Note the intellectual majesty which 
crowns the heads of the great masters of music. 
Handel and Mozart and Beethoven lift above us 
heads as of the immortals. Intellectuality is 
stamped in every line of their faces." 

" Music is not an imitation of nature. Nature 
provides no ready-made models of melody or har- 
mony, as she provides perfect types of form and 
color. Hints she gives of music but only hints. 
Man evolves music from within his own nature. 
It is distinctively the human art. It comes forth 
in the awakening self -consciousness of man. Music 
expresses the awakening self -consciousness of man, 
as he confronts the mystery of the universe, only 
to find a deeper mystery within himself. The 
marvellous creations of modern music are studies 
in self -consciousness ; attempts to run the gamut 
of man's moods, to fathom the problems of his 
being, to find a voice for 

'An infant crying in the night, 
An infant crying for the light.' " 

The thesis outlined in the above quotations 
receives extended treatment in the two papers 
included in this book. The first is on the sub- 
ject of "Mysticism in Music," the second 
deals with "Christian Mysticism in Music." 
The entire scope of the mystical consciousness 
is found in the great works of the great musi- 
cians : the symphonies of Beethoven present- 
ing a complete and positive exposition, the 
other musicians an exposition individualistic 
in every case but sometimes more burdened 
with a negative element of struggle and im- 
perfect realization. 

The book is written with eloquence and au- 
thority; the writer knows music thoroughly 
and deeply, and the subject is one upon which 
he had unquestionable right to speak, being 
at once a great teacher and an adequate musi- 
cian. The reader is led on from height to 
height of exposition, until the final outlook 
gives him a new realization and a new under- 
standing of the illuminating art of music.

THE DIAL 



[ Sept. 2 



In "Music and the Higher Education," Mr. 
Edward Dickinson of Oberlin College makes 
a strong plea for the admission of musical 
study to a regular place in the college cur- 
riculum. Indeed, his argument for his own 
special art involves the consideration of the 
larger project for the admission of the study 
and practice of every art into the courses now 
offered at our universities. At present, with 
such exception as is furnished by polytechnic 
courses, art occupies only a place of modified 
sufferance. Thus music in some institutions 
may be studied under such teachers as Profes- 
sor Converse at Harvard and Professor 
Parker at Yale; but even in these favored 
places music is not given the position and 
rank which belong to it. The question of the 
educational value of the fine arts remains 
practically to be settled, and one may well ask 
why a fully equipped school of music should 
not be granted a coordinate position with a 
similarly endow r ed school of botany or mathe- 
matics or chemistry. 

Sitting in his lecture room at the close of a 
scholastic year, the writer falls into a revery, 
and there floats before him the succession of 
thoughts which have crystallized in this 
volume : 

" Brooding over the problem in the stillness of 
his deserted lecture room, this devotee of music, 
grateful for what his art had done for him, and 
also cordially recognizing the deference due to 
other minds of different experience from his own, 
began to formulate his convictions of the true 
relationship between his own department and the 
whole mechanism of college life. For he felt that 
his duty required not only that he cultivate the 
love of music in his pupils, but that he also adjust 
the results of his teaching to other disciplines, so 
that out of his effort, in correspondence with the 
effort of other guides, a unity of intellectual life 
should proceed. He believed that this unity could 
be achieved, but under what conditions, and by 
what methods'? Like the French philosopher, he 
must be allowed to say, ' I cultivate my garden,' 
but at the same time he must look beyond the 
bounds of the little estate that is given him to 
till, and find inspiration and direction for his 
labors in the adaptation of his husbandry to the 
issues of the greater harvest." 

In the development of the purpose which 
Mr. Dickinson has placed before him, it be- 
comes indispensable that he should take a 
survey of the history of music, give an account 
of its significance and value to general culture, 
and show how far its high and unquestionable 
claims have reached their fruition. It must 
be said at once that all this has been very well 
done; and as the main body of the work is 
given over to this achievement, the volume 
takes its place side by side with Dr. Newton's 



book, and justifies the title given to the pres- 
ent review. The author's point of view is 
made plain in the following quotation : 

" When our spirits are so moved by a stream 
of noble harmonies that all that is beautiful and 
holy in life seems for the moment concentrated 
for our joyful contemplation, are these celestial 
visitants only a mockery, deceiving us, like the 
desert mirage, with a semblance of truth, which, 
when it fades, leaves nothing behind but the 
memory of a glittering delusion? This can hardly 
be. Music is definite enough when it takes pos- 
session of language and event, and adds some- 
thing to them which they required to attain full 
supremacy over us. We see clearly enough what 
this added element is and the eminent service that 
music performs. And do we not often feel that 
music gains an even firmer basis of expression 
when it renounces the aid of a confederate art, 
and takes its stand in a domain of feeling where 
it can afford to be exclusive because sufficient 
unto itself and supreme? The chief support of 
this conviction lies in the consciousness that, when 
we hear great music, it is not one part of our 
nature that is taken captive as when we come 
in contact with a picture, a tale, a play, which 
shuts off a part of life and holds us to that 
but the music is not circumscribed, it is the circuit 
of our spiritual nature that is traversed, we are 
no longer in the presence of the phenomenal but 
the essential; it is the whole in us that is em- 
braced, it is the whole in us that rejoices." 

The contention that the arts should have 
a prominent place in college courses is un- 
doubtedly an important one; and the claims 
of music for inclusion in the curriculum are 
persuasively and logically unfolded in Mr. 
Dickinson's presentation. The experiences of 
a lifetime have gone to the making of his 
argument. We know of no book which more 
thoroughly covers its ground; and the elo- 
quent exposition will carry conviction to the 
reader. It should render admirable service 
in the needed reformations and justifications 
which it propounds.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

The seemingly interminable procession of Mr. 
Arnold Bennett's earlier stories reprinted in Amer- 
ican editions is continued with " The City of 
Pleasure" (Doran). The first thirteen chapters 
pile up a mystery reminiscent in certain details of 
Stevenson's " The Wrong Box," with a great Lon- 
don amusement park as the scene. There is 
apparent murder, an attempt at murder both by 
shooting and poison, a surreptitious love affair, a 
hateful old woman, a popular musical director and 
composer, and a millionaire, besides various exotic 
specimens of humanity to begin with. What is 
more, the mystery baffles ordinary solution until 
a chapter or two before the close, by which time

two other love affairs have been introduced. The 
book is absorbing in its fantastic mingling of 
gayety and mystery. 

Indians, Mormons, outlaws, and the spirit of the 
western desert and mountains combine to make 
Mr. Zane Grey's "The Rainbow Trail" (Harper) 
an unusual story. A preacher disgraced by his 
lapsing faith comes into this distant region to 
rescue, if possible, three persons who have been 
imprisoned in a canon by an earthquake. One of 
these he conceives of as a beautiful girl, and in 
imagination he falls in love with her. When at 
last he comes upon the party, the girl has been 
sealed to a fanatic Mormon as his plural wife. 
By that time his rescue of a noble Navajo's sister 
has brought him the able assistance he so needs 
for her salvation, not alone from the Indian but 
also from a brave Mormon who meets them in the 
Grand Canon of the Colorado. Of course the 
book is melodramatic, but not many readers are 
likely to object to it on that score. 

The impress being made on literature by jour- 
nalism as the practical university in which the art 
of writing in these days is most readily acquired 
shows in the number of journalists who are en- 
listed as heroes of novels. Young Andrew Dick 
in Mr. Keble Howard's " Merry Andrew " (Lane) 
is an instance in point. Very much in love, he 
fails to get his degree at Oxford at a moment when 
his father's death leaves him penniless. He comes 
to London to conquer, and is nearly overwhelmed 
in his first attempts to earn a living with his pen. 
Driven to teaching, he finally makes a successful 
connection by a combination of hard work, deter- 
mination, and luck. The book is well named, for 
the situations in which the hero is involved bring 
smiles, if not laughter. 

The real savor of New England, especially of 
that well preserved and salted portion of it lying 
about Cape Cod, pervades Mr. Joseph C. Lincoln's 
new story, " Thankful's Inheritance" (Appleton). 
The title refers to a plot of land and an old house 
which a woman of sound common sense inherits 
and utilizes as a boarding-house. In and around 
this home the whole action of the story takes place 
and the courtship of both the owner and her pretty 
niece comes to fruition. There is even something 
more than a suspicion of a ghost on the premises 
ghost enough, at least, to bring the villain of the 
tale into remorse of conscience and round out the 
material side of the happy ending. It is a story 
witty enough to make its reading a delight. 

With " Penelope's Postscripts " (Hough ton) we 
bid good-bye but not finally, let us hope to 
the trio of heroines who have smiled through two 
earlier volumes, shepherded by Mrs. Kate Douglas 
Wiggin. Like its predecessors, this smaller book 
maintains the idea that " the most charming 
knowledge is the sort that comes by unconscious 
absorption, like the free grace of God." But the 
three delightful women are now all married, and 
it is " ten years after," and Penelope herself 
writes that she and her husband are " growing 
old with the country that gave us birth (God bless 
it!) and our children growing up with it, as they 



always should." It is a book of peace in a sadly 
troubled world. 

"Me" (Century Co.) is hardly a novel, though 
it has many of the aspects of fiction. It is rather 
an autobiography, sincerely written, of a young 
girl who eventually becomes a successful author 
and playwright, and of her struggles from the 
moment of leaving her Canadian home to become 
the assistant editor of a journal in Jamaica until 
she rids herself of the man with whom she believed 
herself to be in love, a man greatly her senior 
and a rather dreadful person in spite of his kind- 
ness to her. Although published anonymously, the 
author of " Me " is believed to be Onoto Watanna 
(Mrs. Winnifred Eaton Babcock). The book has 
an introduction by Miss Jean Webster. 

Mr. Arnold Mulder opens a new field for Amer- 
ican fiction in " Bram of the Five Corners " 
(McClurg), a story of the Hollanders in Michigan. 
The portrayal of the struggle of conscience in a 
young candidate for the Christian Reformed min- 
istry is strongly and plausibly done. The disturbing 
question, moreover, is a highly practical prob- 
lem in eugenics which confronts him at the moment 
when his faith in Calvinism seemed most secure. 
Driven from his church, Bram takes up newspaper 
work as a sort of last chance, and is awakened to 
its powers of service by his city editor. The book 
is ably written, and excites lively hopes for fur- 
ther work from its author. 

Mr. Frank R. Adams is better known as a pur- 
veyor of libretti for opera bouffe than as a teller 
of tales, but his "Five Fridays" (Small, May- 
nard & Co.) is an entertaining combination of the 
two arts; it is an amusing story which might 
easily be made the basis for an amusing farce. 
Several widely varying characters are marooned 
on an island, with little or no food. Rumors of 
crime bring from the mainland other characters. 
A tenuous love story is introduced, and the situa- 
tions multiply until the farce almost becomes bur- 
lesque. 

In Mrs. Eleanor Hallowell Abbott's "The In- 
discreet Letter" (Century Co.), the action, until 
the climax is reached, takes place on a rushing 
train. The characters are casual, mere chance ac- 
quaintances thrown together in the journey. The 
two men are externally commonplace, but with the 
inner spring of human kindliness that seldom fails 
to flow in proof of the whole world's kinship. The 
third character is a true heroine of romance, speed- 
ing on her way to the journey's end that Shake- 
speare sang. And there is a delicious touch at the 
end, as gratifying as it is unexpected. 

The theme of Mrs. Martha Gilbert Dickinson 
Bianchi's latest novel, " The Kiss of Apollo " 
(Dufifield), is the old one of the woman who seeks 
to conquer nature, and is conquered by it. The 
heroine is shocked in her early youth by the laxity 
of metropolitan society. She closes her eyes to 
realities and lives in her own world, scarcely moved 
when her husband leaves her for another. At the 
end, the love she had earlier spurned she eagerly 
grasps, in the face of the conventions, her boyhood 
lover leaving the priesthood to join her.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

In " Contemporary Portraits " 
and actions 8 (Kenncrley), Mr. Frank Harris 

has written two books where he 
thinks he has written but one. The first of 
these is what the title implies, an effort to 
portray men Mr. Harris has known. With the 
exception of Fabre, some of whose observa- 
tions of insects and animals are charmingly 
retold, the seventeen men Mr. Harris depicts 
are of the literary and artistic classes. We 
are made to see them as Mr. Harris saw them ; 
and we are grateful for many new glimpses of 
the giants of a former generation, Carlyle, 
Renan, Whistler, and Guy de Maupassant, 
as well as for a closer acquaintance with liv- 
ing or very recent celebrities. The portrayal, 
though sympathetic, is honest. Mr. Harris is 
willing, for example, to record Browning's 
outburst of bitterness because Lowell was 
lionized socially more than himself, and to 
express the conviction that Browning "was 
certainly bigger in his writings than he was 
in intimacy." In short, this first book, though 
not of equal value throughout, is praiseworthy 
for its frankness and for its first-hand evi- 
dence as to personalities well worth the know- 
ing. Unfortunately it is mixed in inextrica- 
ble fashion with the other book, which sets 
forth theories and speculations of Mr. Har- 
ris's own. These are usually tiresome, and 
sometimes irritating in both matter and man- 
ner. Mr. Harris takes himself very seriously 
as an interpreter of literary values and of 
modern society and thought. He recurs fre- 
quently to his flighty assumptions about the 
life and personality of Shakespeare. He in- 
dulges in amusing literary comparisons: 
"Matthew Arnold could never have been a 
great critic, but he might surely have reached 
. somewhat the same level as Swinburne " had 
it not been for his "debasing Puritanism." 
He makes bold statements, settles offhand the 
most baffling questions: the late Sir Richard 
Burton was greater both in speech and action 
than Raleigh, Paul Verlaine "is the great- 
est Christian singer since Dante," Carlyle 
(though he "rusted unused," to be sure) was 
the greatest statesman of the past two centu- 
ries in England, French unreserve of speech 
on matters sexual is in every way superior to 
the prudish reticence of Anglo-Saxon peoples, 
the middle class government of England is a 
thing almost utterly bad, and religion and 
immortality are done for. And what shall we 
say of the nonsensical grandiloquence of such 
a passage as this : " Swinburne was the poet 
of youth, and his heritage is as wide as the 
world, and his lovers [are] as numerous as the 



sands of the sea, for all youths will love him 
and quote him with hot hearts and passionate 
tears as long as English is spoken"? Or, in 
reading how we are responsible for the un- 
happy ends of Whistler, Oscar Wilde, John 
Davidson, and Richard Middleton, what shall 
we make of the sentence : " I do not hope to 
persuade Englishmen or Americans of this 
truth [the limitless value of such men] for 
many a year to come, though I have the high- 
est warrant for it and am absolutely convinced 
of the fact"? To put the matter in a nut- 
shell, the second book constitutes an eighteenth 
portrait, that of Mr. Harris himself, and it is 
the least interesting and profitable of any in 
the volume. 

Mr. James Barnes, a newspaper 
TWO travellers , correspondent who handles a 

in Central Africa. _-.: .. , -. _., 

ready pen, and Mr. Cherry 
Kearton, famous as an animal photographer 
and familiar with parts of Africa, have col- 
laborated to produce a most readable and 
attractive volume in " Through Central 
Africa" (Appleton). The purpose of their 
expedition, which left London in April, 1913, 
was to secure a film library of moving pictures 
of animals in their natural surroundings, to 
be presented to natural history museums for 
free exhibition. The travellers planned to 
secure a series of pictures which should repre- 
sent the fauna of Africa from coast to coast, 
from Mombasa on the Indian Ocean to the 
mouth of the Congo River. Fortunately, they 
made a detour from this simple traverse of the 
continent, and spent weeks in the grass-lands 
back of Nairobi and up toward the Abyssinian 
border. This was familiar ground to Mr. 
Kearton, and many beautiful and interesting 
pictures were there secured. Later on they 
took up the traverse, and crossing the great 
lake, struck through the forest, travelling on 
foot and by canoe to Basoko, where they took 
steamer down the Congo. The travellers were 
surprised and grievously disappointed to find 
that the forest was not suited to moving- 
picture work ; and they lost their time, labor, 
and money so far as their main purpose was 
concerned, in this, the piece de resistance of 
their expedition. For the pleasure of the 
picture-loving reader, it is lucky that so much 
was done in the preliminary journey, because 
almost no animal pictures were secured in the 
forest. The real interest of the book, however, 
is found in its account of the continental 
traverse; though thousands have passed over 
these trails during the last thirty years, few 
good descriptions of the experience have been 
written. The forest itself, though gloomy and 
depressing, has its charm ; though animal pic-

tures cannot be caught in its dim recesses, its 
human inhabitants can be posed in the sun- 
light of its little clearings and their pictures 
taken ; history has been made even here, and 
everywhere one is oppressed with memories 
of Stanley and "the rear guard" and Emin 
Pasha's relief. Here in the forest of the 
Ituri-Aruwimi River live the purest type of 
pygmies and little-known tribes of cannibals. 
Mr. Barnes came into contact with all of these 
peoples, and gives us some fine pictures of the 
little folk. From his book we do not get much 
description of life or customs, nor of geogra- 
phy or country, we get nothing, perhaps, in 
the way of new scientific facts. It is a narra- 
tive pure and simple, interestingly told, of a 
journey unusual, if not unique, in character 
and purpose. The writer tells us that they 
"are very glad they went, but there are cer- 
tain portions of the journey that they would 
not care to do again." These "certain por- 
tions," by the way, seem really to be the most 
important part of their enterprise. 



Books for f tne numerous series 

the wayfarer's launched in recent years have 
justified themselves so immedi- 
ately and decidedly as does " The Wayfarer's 
Library" (Button). Bearing the imprint of 
the English and American publishing houses 
which have produced " Everyman's Library " 
in collaboration, we take it that the new series 
is designed as a sort of adjunct to that benefi- 
cent enterprise, giving sanctuary, as it were, 
to those numerous books in recent English 
literature which, while standing well above 
the ephemeral mass of publications, have not 
yet attained the rank of classics. But that 
this idea has not been held to as closely as 
might be desired is evident from a survey of 
the two score volumes with which the series is 
inaugurated. On the one hand we have such 
commonplace stock in trade for the reprinter 
as Lamb's essays and Dickens's Christmas sto- 
ries ; on the other we find the sort of current 
iiction indicated by the names of such writers 
as Guy Boothby, L. Cope Cornford, and Mrs. 
Belloc Lowndes. But between these extremes 
are many titles which deserve and will evoke 
the heartiest welcome. First place, in our 
judgment, belongs to George Gissing's "Pri- 
vate Papers of Henry Ryecroft," a book as 
surely destined to become a classic in its kind 
as any other English prose work of the past 
quarter century. Scarcely less welcome is the 
posthumous collection of Gissing's stories 
entitled "The House of Cobwebs," a reprint 
which would be well worth while if only for 
the biographical sketch of the author which 
it contains. Three of Mr. Bernard Shaw's 



early adventures in fiction "An Unsocial 
Socialist," "Love among the Artists," and 
" Cashel Byron's Profession," are given a new 
lease of life. We are especially glad, also, to 
have in such convenient form those two gems 
of inimitable humor, Mr. Barry Pain's "De 
Omnibus" and Mr. F. Anstey's "Baboo 
Jabberjee, B. A." The essay form is worthily 
represented by such books as Mr. Dobson's 
" Eighteenth Century Studies," Mr. G. W. E. 
Russell's " Selected Essays on Literary Sub- 
jects," Mr. G. S. Street's "The Ghosts of 
Piccadilly," and Mr. Holbrook Jackson's 
" Southward Ho ! " Of miscellaneous works 
we find a charming open-air anthology enti- 
tled " The Lore of the Wanderer " ; Mr. A. G. 
Gardiner's vivid pen portraits of present-day 
English celebrities, "Prophets, Priests, and 
Kings " ; and Mr. James Milnes's " Epistles 
of Atkins." While we have been able to give 
in the foregoing at least an indication of the 
range and interest of the literary field covered 
by " The Wayfarer's Library," we must leave 
our readers to discover for themselves the 
physical attractiveness of the volumes. That 
such excellence of bookmaking is compatible 
with the modest price at which the volumes 
are sold is little less than remarkable. 



Fact and fiction Amusement for a summer after- 
in the form of noon will be found in disentan- 

biography. ^^ ^ ^ fr()m ^ ^.^ in 

" The Record of Nicholas Freydon : An Auto- 
biography" (Doran), by an anonymous au- 
thor of evident talent, if not even of genius. 
The problem of his identity, too, challenges 
the acuteness of the reader, and there is room 
for a good deal of shrewd guessing without 
hitting the mark unless the casually im- 
parted information that the writer was ten 
years and one day old on the second of May, 
1870, be strictly true and so a check to any- 
thing like random conjecture as to the author- 
ship. The story, or history, is of a literary 
life of painfully earned success, chiefly jour- 
nalistic, the scene being alternately in London, 
Australia, London again, and finally Aus- 
tralia. Orphanage and poverty and a proud 
and rather defiant disposition constitute the 
chief part of the hero's somewhat conven- 
tional equipment; but the vicissitudes of his 
arduous climb to a fair measure of success in 
his calling are not altogether of the usual sort 
quite the contrary in some instances. The 
spiritual struggles and agonies, moreover, are 
of absorbing interest, and serve to give dis- 
tinction to the book. In its general scheme 
the work is not unlike George Gissing's " The 
Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft." As in

niscence and reflection, so here we have an 
ostensible " editor," who prepares for the 
press, with editorial comment, the posthumous 
papers of his friend of pathetic memory ; and 
in both instances the oneness of editor and 
author is manifest. In the later book, far 
more than in the earlier, verisimilitude is 
marred by the dramatic intensity of the lights 
and shades, the startling nature of the acci- 
dents and coincidences, the completeness and 
rhetorical finish of the recorded conversations, 
even those recalled from childhood, and the 
prevailing atmosphere of romance. Without 
doubt the narrative is a skilful mingling of 
fact and fiction, a groundwork of actual expe- 
rience with trimmings of a lesser degree of 
actuality, all presented with much literary art 
and calculated to charm the reader who once 
opens the volume. One at least of the writer's 
assertions about himself is evidently true : he 
mentions the scantiness of his schooling and 
his ignorance of grammar, and this confes- 
sion prepares one for such lapses as "this 
minutiae," "that strata," a glaring misuse of 
"complaisant" and "complaisance" for "com- 
placent" and "complacence," and the misquo- 
tation, "Je suis, je reste" a misquotation 
that the " editor " reproduces, curiously 
enough, in his concluding note. Taken all in 
all, " The Record of Nicholas Freydon " is a 
notable contribution to pseudo-autobiography. 



rt,,r r There are two reasons why an 

J. ne lierman -,. . -r-i i i an m-i -m- 

soldier's edition in English of The War 

Book of the German General 
Staff" (McBride, Nast & Co.) is welcome. In 
the first place, it gives us documentary evi- 
dence of the most authoritative sort concern- 
ing the methods that Germany intends to 
employ in any war with which she may be 
faced. In the second place, it yields indirect 
testimony to support those accusations of ter- 
rorism and atrocity which many judicious 
people, in spite of the Bryce report, are still 
loath to believe. The translation is by Dr. 
J. H. Morgan, Professor of Constitutional 
Law in the University of London, whose intro- 
duction is a sort of moralizing commentary on 
the text that follows. The translation is 
vouched for as literal and integral ; even the 
foot-notes are rendered ; where the editor has 
added a. note of his own it is bracketted and 
initialed. What strikes one most in reading 
the book is the contrast between the moderate 
and humane general principles of military 
conduct and the truculent exceptions when 
need compels. In this way the excellent theory 
of " civilized " warfare is rendered nugatory 
in use. International law and Hague conven- 
tions are academically desirable, but in prac- 



tice they must yield before military necessity. 
Here is an example in nuce of this logic of 
militarism : " No inhabitant of the occupied 
territory is to be disturbed in the use and free 
disposition of his property ; on the other hand 
the necessity of war justifies the most far- 
reaching disturbance, restriction, and even 
imperiling of his property." Perhaps the 
most offensive pronouncement of all is the 
assertion that " indeed international law is in 
no way opposed to the exploitation of the 
crimes of third parties (assassination, incen- 
diarism, robbery, and the like) to the preju- 
dice of the enemy." When one reflects further 
that necessity often means simply expe- 
diency, the German doctrine Not kennt kein 
Gebot becomes, in the language of the street, 
" anything to win." And that is the final les- 
son of the War Book of the German General 
Staff. 



Aspects of 

contemporary 

journalism. 



" The Coming Newspaper " 
(Holt), a collection of addresses 
and papers on journalism by 
experienced newspaper men, is edited by Pro- 
fessor Merle Thorpe, of the department of 
journalism in the University of Kansas. He 
names the volume, not in an accurately de- 
scriptive manner, from his own initial con- 
tribution to its contents. Other contributors 
are Dr. Washington Gladden, Mr. Oswald 
Garrison Villard, Mr. Melville E. Stone, Mr. 
Norman Hapgood, Dr. Lyman Abbott, Mr. 
Hamilton Holt, and a dozen more of like 
standing; and they discourse on such themes 
as " Tainted Journalism," " Some Weaknesses 
of Modern Journalism," " The Clubber in 
Journalism," "A Modern Type of Country 
Journalism," "A State License for Newspaper 
Men," "The English Substitute for the 
License Plan," "A Code of Ethics for News- 
paper Men," " Government Regulation for 
Press Associations," " Community Service," 
and " Giving the Public What It Wants." As 
may be recognized by some readers, a number 
of these chapters were first made public by 
their respective authors in the course of those 
memorable exercises that distinguished Kan- 
sas Newspaper Week (May 1014) from the 
rest of the weeks of the year 1914; and the 
topics treated were selected from a list ob- 
tained by the issue of a questionnaire to " one 
thousand men and women in public and pri- 
vate life." Thus a creditable measure of suc- 
cess has been attained in giving to the various 
disquisitions a more than academic interest. 
Actual experience and ripe reflection speak in 
almost every paragraph. On the first page of 
his opening chapter ("The Coming News- 
paper'') Professor Thorpe scores "the man

who continually harks back to the grand old 
days of Greeley " and " fails utterly to appre- 
ciate how impossible it would be for the news- 
less, violently partisan journal of the fifties to 
find a footing in our present-day life, uncon- 
fronted, as it is, by any great moral crisis." 
It is true we have no slavery question to vex 
us now, but other issues involving moral con- 
siderations of the first importance are not 
lacking. Improvement in our journalism dur- 
ing the last ten years is detected by the same 
writer, and on the whole the tone of the entire 
book is hopeful, constructively critical rather 
than sourly censorious. But of course this 
was to be expected, as well as desired, from a 
company of men engaged in journalism of the 
better sort. 



A Florentine 
sculptor of 

the 15th century. 



Allan Marquand's 
imposing work on "Luca della 

^^ ( p rinceton U niv e rs i t y 

Press), is a most valuable contribution to art 
history. It furnishes a descriptive catalogue 
of all the works of one of the great artists of 
the fifteenth century, one who, it has been 
declared, gave impulse to the Renaissance; 
one who was the founder of a " school " of 
sculpture, chiefly among the members of his 
own family. Luca was born in 1399 or 1400, 
and died in 1481. His work in sculpture dates 
from 1430. Sixteen years later, being unable 
to execute by himself the numerous commis- 
sions he was receiving from every part of 
Italy, he formed a partnership with his 
nephew, Andrea, and his great-nephew, Gio- 
vanni ; and also employed as helpers the two 
Duccio brothers, Ottaviano and Agostino, who 
are often erroneously regarded as members 
of the Robbia family. The four were collabo- 
rators with Luca in most of his later work. 
To Luca is accorded the distinction, not of 
inventing the process of enamel-glazing terra 
cotta, the " secret " of which he is said to have 
confided to Andrea, his nephew, but of suc- 
cessfully applying to sculpture what Palissy 
a century later applied to pottery. It was 
Luca's purpose to democratize sculpture so 
that even village churches might possess works 
of art which before were reserved -for the pos- 
session of the great cathedrals and the wealthy 
metropolitan churches. Out of these circum- 
stances have arisen the problems which the 
present volume attempts to solve. How much 
of all the exquisite glazed terra cotta in the 
della Robbia style now extant or known for- 
merly to have existed was really the work of 
Luca? How much was the work of Andrea, 
which was often compared and contrasted 
with that of his uncle? How much was the 
work of other members of the family or of 



more or less successful imitators ? A solution 
of these problems has engaged the attention of 
Professor Marquand for the past twenty years 
or more; and his final collation of all the 
documentary evidence bearing on the ques- 
tion, his chronological classification of all the 
work of Luca della Robbia, and his examina- 
tion of the works which have sometimes been 
attributed to him, may be accepted as the final 
word on a fascinating subject. The pictorial 
presentation of the volume is sure to be a 
delight to art lovers. From the scanty details 
of his life that are preserved to us, Luca della 
Robbia appears to have been a man of irre- 
proachable character, whose work was done 
from the most unselfish of motives, and who 
left thereon the impress of a pure, humble, 
and affectionate nature. The promise that 
the present volume will be followed before 
long by others on Andrea della Robbia and 
Giovanni della Robbia, and on the Robbia 
School, will be a source of satisfaction in many 
quarters. 

Laid on the shelf for a year by 

m e ie a s nean his own . ch o ic e, from a prema- 
ture feeling of superannuation, 
the author of "From the Shelf" (Button), 
who calls himself "Paxton Holgar" on his 
title-page and "John" in the body of his 
book, narrates his recuperative experiences in 
a deserted monastery on what we assume to 
be one of the Balearic Islands. At any rate, 
it is a Spanish island, delightfully somnolent 
and unmodernized, in the Mediterranean; 
and the author's graphic touches of local color 
and local character, with morsels of romance 
and adventure, and an atmosphere of almost 
convincing reality not prosaic realism 
over all, make one envy him the twelve 
months' rest and communion with nature and 
his own soul that ended in the happy manner 
he so well describes in his closing chapters. 
But the reader's natural desire to believe it all 
a true story cannot blind him, even with the 
best of will to meet the author half-way, to 
occasional inconsistencies and artificialities. 
On one page, for instance, the narrator calls 
himself " naturally unobservant," although in 
a later passage he gives evidence of acute 
observation and refers to his "usually keen, 
eyes." Nevertheless, the book is a little mas- 
terpiece in its way, in its combination of topo- 
graphic detail that escapes weariness and 
character-sketching that makes its subjects 
live and breathe before one's eyes. "Whatever 
and wherever may be the geographic equiva- 
lents of the author's San Telmo and Torelya, 
he knows them well and pictures them charm- 
ingly.

NOTES. 



A thorough critical study of Mr. Gilbert K. 
Chesterton has been made by Mr. Julius West, and 
will appear during the autumn. 

L. T. Hobhouse's " Morals in Evolution," first 
published in 1907, will shortly appear in a new 
and revised edition, with Messrs. Holt's imprint. 

Early in the autumn an illustrated book by 
Colonel Robert McCormick, dealing with his expe- 
riences in the war area, will be published by the 
Macmillan Co. 

A new and cheaper edition of the late Francis 
Fisher Browne's " Everyday Life of Abraham 
Lincoln " will be issued early in the autumn by 
Messrs. Putnam. 

Mr. James Huneker's forthcoming volume of

A new and complete edition of Browning's 
poetical works, embodying the new poems pub- 
lished in a separate volume some months ago, will 
be published at once by the Macmillan Co. 

The title of Mr. H. G. Wells's new novel, which 
the Macmillan Co. will publish this month, is " The 
Research Magnificent." It is described as " the 
story of one man's search for the kingly life." 

The third volume of M. Artzibashef's to be pub- 
lished in English translation within less than a 
year is " Breaking-point," which Mr. B. W. 
Huebsch announces for immediate publication. 

A new series of " Essays for College Men," 
compiled by Professors Foerster, Manchester, and 
Young of the University of Wisconsin, is an- 
nounced for immediate publication by Messrs. 
Holt. 

" The Story of a Pioneer," by Dr. Anna Howard 
Shaw, in which the famous suffrage advocate tells 
the tale of her own life of many and varied activi- 
ties, will appear this month with Messrs. Harper's 
imprint. 

A translation of M. Antoine Guilland's "Mod- 
ern Germany and Its Historians " (Niebuhr, 
Ranke, Mommsen, Sybel, and Treitschke) has been 
prepared and will soon be issued by Messrs. 
McBride, Nast & Co. 

Mr. Stanley Washburn, whose " Field Notes 
from the Russian Front " was recently published, 
has a further volume in the press, continuing his 
narrative under the title, " The Russian Cam- 
paign, January to July, 1915." 

A new historical romance of love and adventure 
by Miss Mary Johnston is among the autumn pub- 
lications of Houghton Mifflin Co. It is entitled 
" The Fortunes of Garin," and has for its scene 
Southern France in the time of the Crusades. 

" The People's Government," by Dr. David 
Jayne Hill, former Ambassador to Germany, will 
be published early this month by Messrs. Apple- 
ton. It constitutes a discussion of the relations 
between the citizen and the State, of the origin 
and possibilities of the State, and of the sources 
of its authority. 



A volume of essays by Professor William Henry 
Hudson, to be entitled " A Quiet Corner in a 
Library," is promised by Messrs. Rand, McNally 
& Co. The writers discussed are Tom Hood, 
George Lillo, Richardson, and the author of " Sally 
in Our Alley." 

The first of several posthumous works by the 
late John Muir is announced for October publi- 
cation by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. under the 
title of " Travels in Alaska." It is planned to 
issue the book in both a regular and a limited 
large paper edition. 

A volume of "Letters of Washington Irving to 
Henry Brevoort," extending from 1807 to 1843, 
and mostly unpublished, edited by Mr. George S. 
Hellman, is one of the more interesting literary 
announcements of the autumn season. Messrs. 
Putnam will publish the book. 

" Feminism in Germany and Scandinavia," by 
Miss Katharine Anthony, will be published this 
month by Messrs. Holt. It will give a full ac- 
count of what the leaders of the woman movement 
in Germany and the three northern kingdoms are 
attempting and have achieved. 

Mr. Thomas H. Dickinson, the editor of the 
recently-published volume, " The Chief Contem- 
porary Dramatists," discusses present tendencies 
in the dramatic affairs of this country in his 
book, " The Case of American Drama," which the 
Houghton Mifflin Co. will publish this month. 

Arrangements have already been made by 
Messrs. Holt for the publication next March of a 
volume by Dr. Richard Burton, the tentative title 
of which is " Bernard Shaw : The Man and the 
Mask." A book of "Poems of Earth's Mean- 
ing " by Dr. Burton will also appear under the 
same imprint at a later date. 

We understand that there will soon appear a 
fuller account than has yet been published in En- 
glish of the life and personality of Frau Krupp 
von Bohlen, who inherited from her father, the 
late Friedrich Krupp, the huge arsenal at Essen. 
There is no little romantic interest in this young 
girl in whose control lies the greatest of modern 
factories for the output of engines of death. 

Professor Fred Lewis Pattee, of Pennsylvania 
State College, has prepared "A History of Ameri- 
can Literature since 1870," which the Century Co. 
will bring out before long. The author is said to 
have chosen 1870 as the starting point of his 
record because he thinks that only then, with the 
consolidation of national sentiment following the 
Civil War, did a national literature really begin. 

To their fine series of Riverside Press limited 
editions, Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. will shortly 
add the following : Montaigne's " Essay on 
Friendship," together with twenty-nine sonnets by 
Estienne de la Boetie, translated by Mr. Louis 
How ; "A Handbook of Gastronomy " by Jean 
Anthelme Brillat-Savarin ; and " Dr. Holmes's 
Boston," a compilation edited by Miss Caroline 
Ticknor. 

" The Covent-Garden Journal by Henry Field- 
ing," edited, with Introduction and Notes, by Dr.

Gerard E. Jensen, will be issued during the autumn 
by the Yale University Press. From the same 
house will come " The Life and Times of Tenny- 
son," by the late Thomas R. Lounsbury, and a 
translation of M. Paul Claudel's play, " L'Otage," 
made by Miss Clara Bell, with an Introduction by 
M. Pierre Chavannes. 

A " History of the Norwegian People," by Mr. 
Knut Gjerset, is announced for immediate publi- 
cation by the Macmillan Co. The work is in two 
volumes, covering the history of Norway and its 
people from the earliest times, and dealing not 
only with the life of the people in Norway itself, 
but also with the influence exerted upon other 
nations by the Norwegians who have emigrated to 
other countries, including the United States. 

In " Memories of a Publisher," a forthcoming 
volume by Mr. George Haven Putnam, the author 
continues his personal reminiscences from 1865, 
the date to which the narrative in his earlier book, 
" Memories of My Youth," had been brought. The 
new volume will contain records of well-known 
people whom the author has met during the last 
fifty years, together with his views on questions of 
the day in which he has, as a citizen, taken his 
part. 

Mr. Harry A. Gushing, of the New York bar, 
has written a concise volume on " Voting Trusts : 
Chapters in Recent Corporate History," said to be 
the first book upon this subject, which the Mac- 
millans announce for issue this month. The same 
house has nearly ready " The Criminal Imbecile," 
by Mr. Henry H. Goddard, which gives an analy- 
sis of certain murder cases in which the Binet 
tests were used, and discusses the question of re- 
sponsibility. 

Some interesting publications in the field of 
poetry announced by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin 
Co. for October issue include " The Little Book of 
American Poets," edited by Miss Jessie Kitten- 
house; " The Quiet Hour," edited by Mr. FitzRoy 
Carrington ; "Af ternoons of April " by Miss Grace 
Hazard Conkling ; " Interflow " by Mr. Geoffrey 
C. Faber; and two verse dramas "The Clois- 
ter " by Emile Verhaeren, and " Red Wine of 
Roussillon " by Mr. William Lindsey. 

"The Chronicle of Twelve Days, July 23- 
August 4, 1914, with an Interpretation," by Mr. 
William Archer, is announced by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press. The author's object has been to 
weave the official dispatches and other authentic 
documents into a connected narrative in his own 
words, " to reduce this confusion of voices to 
something like a logical sequence, and in so doing 
to determine who was responsible for the fact 
that a ' happy ending ' was obstinately staved off, 
in favour of the sanguinary catastrophe now 
working itself out." 

One of the chief art books of the coming season 
will be devoted to "Belgium," with illustrations 
by Mr. Frank Brangwyn. There will be twenty- 
five plates from Mr. Brangwyn's original draw- 
ings, reproduced by wood engraving. The text is 
by Mr. Hugh Stokes. The work has been dedi- 
cated by permission to the King of the Belgians, 



and will include an introduction by M. Paul Lam- 
botte, Belgian Minister of Fine Arts. Besides the 
ordinary editions there will be an edition de luxe. 
A liberal royalty on the work will go to the Bel- 
gian Relief Fund. 

The present condition of the Polish Jews, 
" driven hither and yon, from one gang of tor- 
turers to the other," has been represented by eye- 
witnesses as incomparably more pitiful than that 
of the unhappy Belgians. This lamentable state 
and many other woes of the Hebrew people are 
to be remedied, it is hoped by many of their 
number, when the Zionist movement shall have 
achieved its end. A timely utterance on the sub- 
ject is Professor Horace Meyer Kallen's " Na- 
tionality and the Jewish Stake in the Great War," 
reprinted from " The Menorah Journal," and 
obtainable from the Zionist Bureau of New En- 
gland, 161 Devonshire Street, Boston. 

The first number of a new monthly magazine in 
French whose interests and scope are defined by 
its title, " La Revue de Hollande," has reached 
us. Among the contributions to this (July) issue 
we note Emile Verhaeren's " Le passe des Flan- 
dres," Ph. Zilcken's " Quelques souvenirs sur Ed- 
mond de Goncourt," Dirk Coster's " Introduction 
a 1'etude de la litterature neerlandaise," and Henri 
Malo's " Les defenses de 1'Yser dans 1'Histoire," 
together with verses by Max Elskamp, Fernand 
Severin, and Fernand de Solpray. " In Memo- 
riam," by the editor, M. G. S. de Solpray, is an 
appreciation of the French writers who have died 
in the present war, numbering nearly thirty at 
the time of compiling this list. 

A new publisher with an interesting and dis- 
tinctive programme is Mr. Alfred A. Knopf, whose 
imprint will appear upon a title-page in the 
autumn for the first time. Mr. Knopf's special 
aim at first will be the publishing of English ver- 
sions of Russian classics and modern works, many 
of which have never been put before the English- 
reading jmblic. The following works by the older 
Russian authors will be among the first to be 
issued : " The Cathedral Staff of Priests," Les- 
kov's classic of the clergy; Lermontov's "A Hero 
of Our Times " ; Shchedrin's novel, " The Family 
Golovlev " ; Goncharov's masterpiece, " Oblomov," 
and Gogol's tale of the Cossacks, " Taras Bulba." 
Of the. younger men in Russian literature a dozen 
or more authors are represented in the list of 
books Mr. Knopf plans to publish in the near 
future. Among these are Kuprin's military novel, 
" The Duel," and a volume of his short stories ; 
Ropschin's "As If It Had Never Happened," a 
story of the last attempted revolution in Russia; 
Sologub's first important novel, " The Little De- 
mon," and a volume of his stories called " The 
Old House " ; Veressayev's " Memoirs of a Phy- 
sician"; and a volume of stories by Garshin. 
Works by Ivan Bunin, Kamensky, Briussov, and 
Erastov will appear later on. The field of drama 
will be represented with plays by Turgenev, 
Ostrovsky, and Gogol. Mr. Knopf expects to pub- 
lish also a new and cheaper edition of Prince Kro- 
potkin's " Russian Literature," a standard survey 
of the subject.

III. Poems and Songs by Bjorn- 
stjerne Bjornson 

Translated from the Norwegian in the Original 
Meters, with an Introduction and Notes, by Arthur 
Hubbell Palmer, 1915. xxii+264 pages. Price $1.50. 
Bjornson the man is better known to the American 
public than Bjornson the writer. His rugged personality 
has impressed itself upon the imagination as "Norway's 
uncrowned King." Here he is presented through the 
medium of the lyrics that won him the title of " Norway's 
beating heart." This volume contains the first transla- 
tion of Bjornson's Digte og Sange following his final edition 
of 1903.

IV. Master Olof 
Strindberg 

Translated from the Swedish with an Introduction 
by Edwin Bjorkman. 1915. xxiii-\-i25 pages. 
Price $1.50. 

MASTER OLOF acquaints English readers with Strind- 
berg from an aspect hitherto unfamiliar to them. Written 
when he was but twenty-two years old, this drama became 
the cornerstone of a remarkable cycle of historical plays, 
the product of his mature genius. Out of materials of 
historic fact, his imagination has created a profoundly 
stirring drama showing the various forces that were strug- 
gling for mastery.

"Holberg's comedies are excellent dramatic material

"Apart from the fact that Tegner was the head of the 
Gothic school in Sweden those who looked to the annals 
of their own land rather than to France for inspiration 
the most notable characteristic of his verse is its lyric quality."

II. Ballad Criticism in Scandinavia and Great Britain during the

By Sigurd Bernhard Hustvedt, Instructor in English in the University of Illinois, 1915. Price $3.00.

"There has always been a peculiar fascination for the student of American history in that chapter of it which deals with 
the pre-Columbian discovery of this continent. ... To sweep away the cobwebs of error is no small task, but Professor 
Hovgaard's book, with its painstaking following of the scientific method, should go a long way towards its completion. . . . 
Professor Hovgaard has made the best complete exposition up to date of the voyages of the Norsemen to America." Boston

SOCIALIZED GERMANY 

By FREDERIC C. HOWE 

AUTHOR OF "THE MODERN CITY" 

"The German Peril," says Dr. Howe in his preface, "is only in part a military peril. 
It is a peace peril as well. The real peril to the other powers of Western civilization 
lies in the fact that Germany is more intelligently organized than is the rest of the 
world. ' ' The book shows how this organization has come about. $i .50 net; postage extra. 




The Fighting Cheyennes

Author of "Beyond the Old Frontier," etc. 
The result of almost a life work on the part 
of the author, one of the first living authorities 
on the American Indian, and is the full history 
of a great Indian tribe whose relations have 
involved not only most of the other Western

The Road to Glory 

BY E. ALEXANDER POWELL 
Some of the most romantic and heroic of the 
exploits of our history generally neglected 
by the regular historian because of their un- 
official character, and therefore unfamiliar or 
unknown to the general reader are vividly 
recounted in these stirring pages and become real 
to the reader in the intense, swift, and spirited 
narrative. Illustrated. $1.50 net; postage extra. 




What I Believe and Why 

BY WILLIAM HAYES WARD, DD., LL.D. 
Editor of The Independent 

This book is a candid attempt to analyze 
the beliefs of a sincerely religious man whose 
faith has persisted in the midst of the last half 
century's tremendous increase in scientific 
knowledge. In these days of materialistic 
attacks on religious belief and the theory that 
knowledge and reasoning are working against 
theology the timeliness of this book is indis- 
putable. It has a thoroughly scientific basis. 
$1.50 net; postage extra. 




Ivory, Apes, and Peacocks 

BY JAMES HUNEKER 

Author of "Egoists," "Promenades of an Impressionist," etc. 

In this new book Mr. Huneker, after his 
excursion to the New Cosmopolis and various 
European cities, returns to the literary and art 
topics which he always discusses in such brilliant, 
incisive, and entertaining fashion. Under his 
alluring titles (borrowed from the manifest of 
Solomon's ship trading with Tarshish) a rich and 
varied cargo of merchandise is collected. There is 
a critical article on Joseph Conrad, cordial to 
enthusiasm; a piquant paper on Whitman 
characterizing the poet as well as describing 
a visit to him; thoroughgoing illuminating dis- 
cussions of Dostoievsky, Tolstoy, Richard Strauss 
and many others. $i-5o net; postage extra. 




Oriental Rugs 

BY JOHN KIMBERLY MUMFORD 

This book, the purpose of which when it first 
appeared was to describe, identify, and ex- 
pound the old, native rugs of the Orient, has 
met the test of time by a sustained popularity 
which has induced the publishers to offer a new 
edition, revised and amplified, but lower in price. 
Profusely illustrated -with color plates, piano-type, 
and half-tone. New and completely revised 
edition. $S-oo net; postage extra.

tive, proportions of the human figure; charcoal,

designing, lettering, materials, instruments, and

CONSTANTINOPLE 

OLD AND NEW 

By H. G. DWIGHT 

Mr. Dwight's book on the various phases of life in Constantinople, its unique and most picturesque 
characteristics, is such as even with Mr. Dwight's charming style very few men could have written. 
He has lived in Constantinople in boyhood and manhood in real intimacy with the people, and the 
vividness of his early impressions has been supplemented by a deep study of Turkish character and of 
the significance of the city's associations. His book is in these respects the most informing yet written 
about the Turkish capital. Profusely illustrated. In box, $5.00 net; postage extra. 




The Reconciliation of 

Government with Liberty 

BY PROFESSOR JOHN W. BURGESS, LL.D. 

The purpose of Professor Burgess is to 
show within the compass of a single volume 
what all the states of the world have done 
for the solution of the great problem defined 
in his title and to present concisely the stage 
in that solution at which each has arrived. 
At this moment the book is a document of 
special interest. #2.50 net; postage extra.

other forms of recorded observation and com- 
mentary, of those French men and women who 
visited this country between 1775 and 1880 
many of them to assist in our war for liberty 
forms an extremely vivid, lively, and instructive 
presentation of this most interesting period of our 
history. With illustrations from paintings and 
engravings. Crown 8vo. $2.00 net; postage extra. 




The Holy Earth 

BY L. H. BAILEY 

Editor of the "Cyclopedia of American Horticulture."

authority upon agriculture in all its ramifica- 
tions attempts, by presenting his personal point 
of view and judgment on the rural situation and 
man's relation to rural environment, to awaken 
a sense of the basic character of nature, not only

and spiritual life. $1.00 net; postage extra.

Beautiful Gardens in America 

and the Effect of Climate in Various Sections. 

BY LOUISE SHELTON 

This volume consists of beautiful pictures of a 
great variety of those gardens in this country which 
may be taken as representative of the possibilities 
of gardening under our diverse climatic condi- 
tions, accompanied by brief but truly illumi- 
native text. As the author says, "the views con- 
tained within this book show chiefly gardens 
planned by owners earnestly laboring to express 
their sense of the beautiful in these their out- 
door homes. " Illustrated with more than 170 
photographs and with 8 full-page color reproduc- 
tions. $5.00 net; postage extra. 




The Fountains of Papal Rome 

BY MRS. CHARLES MACV~EAGH 

One of the most characteristic features of 
the Eternal City is the numerous and often 
magnificent fountains served by the excep- 
tionally abundant water-supply. Of papal 
Rome particularly these monuments may 
almost be said to summarize the story. Mrs. 
MacVeagh has treated them in this sense as 
well as describing them with artistic sympathy.

Much has been written about the work of the early 
American craftsmen, but little attention has been paid to 
their personal lives and characters. Mr Dyer's book not 
only surveys their work in architecture, glassware, pot- 
tery, etc. but also the men themselves.

postage 10 cents. (Ready Oct. 8.) 



PARIS REBORN

the first five months of the war, and reflecting freshly and 
spontaneously all the events and fluctuations of those

significance of these events, in the midst of which the 
spirit of Paris has been born again.

HIGH LIGHTS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 

By Hilaire Belloc, author of " Robespierre," etc. 

A brilliant series of essays in which the outstanding moments of the most dramatic hour in modern history are described

Tuileries, the execution of Louis XVI are among the subjects he has chosen, and they are connected by prefatory notes briefly 
sketching the intermediate course of events. Picturesque, vivid, minutely circumstantial, rushing in interest. In literary 
qualities the episodes are comparable with those of Carlyle.

color. Royal octavo, about 300 pages. Price $3.00 net, postage 10 cents. (Ready Oct. 22.)

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



THE CENTURY 

For October 
Meddling with our Neighbors 

Have we Belgianized Nicaragua? The Stars and 
Stripes were floating over the White House in the 
Capital of Nicaragua when Lincoln G. Valentine wrote 
this astounding article. For five years Nicaragua has 
been virtually in charge of American Marines. The 
five Central American Republics, formerly a single 
union, are clamoring for re-union and armed resistance 
to the "Eagle of the North." 

The Friends 

One of the best short stories of the year, a thing of 
almost uncanny fascination. It is made of men and 
things as commonplace as cabbages; yet through some 
legerdemain in the telling it achieves a continuously 
cumulative interest that is fairly astounding. 

The Average Voter 

Is the average voter a failure? Is there an average 
voter? Walter Weyl, in this searching article, takes 
stock of America's voting quality. 

My Debut in Paris 

Francis Grierson, the strange musical genius who 
was raised in America and then amazed Europe with a 
new kind of music, tells of his introduction to the 
brilliant Parisian society of the end of the Second 
Empire. 

Female Delicacy in the Sixties 

What is so rare as a swooning lady now? But they 
weren't rare sixty years ago. They were the ideals 
then. Amy Louise Reed discusses the almost in- 
credible foolishnesses of and about women, especially 
young women, before the Civil War. 

"Here Comes Grover" 



The Fat Boy is peculiar to himself, typically unique. 
His heart and mind know different reactions from 
those of an ordinary mortal. His bashfulness betrays 
strange complexes. Grover, in Frank Leon Smith's 
story, lives, breathes, and pants. 

Rome Rampant 

Did Italy go to war to avoid revolution at home? 
T. Lothrop Stoddard analyzes the Italian situation in 
his usual clear, vigorous, entertaining way. 

Old Masters of Photography 

Alvan Langdon Coburn, himself a master of the art 
of which he writes, tells about four great pioneers in 
the field of photography. 

And 

"Pleasures and Palaces" the third instalment 
of Princess Lazarovich's sprightly reminiscences of 
social and artistic life in Europe; the third instalment 
of "Dear Enemy," Jean Webster's very charming 
serial; the fourth instalment of "We Discover New 
England," in which Louise Closser Hale and Walter 
Hale visit the North Shore; two humorous short 
stories; "The Long Way, " a piece of vigor and splendor 
in verse by Badger Clark; verse of distinction by Louis 
Untermeyer and others; and THE CENTURY'S cus- 
tomary offering of inset pictures.

PETER PARAGON 




A great many authors have written A Tale of Youth, but very few have written it so 
exquisitely as John Palmer. His novel, baldly stated, is John Paragon's childhood, his 
boyhood, his youth, his early, tentative love affairs, and his final wonderful love story. 
But describing " Peter Paragon " thus is like trying to describe a beautiful picture in 
mathematical terms. " Peter Paragon " is written as Galsworthy or Thurston write, 
with a deliberate choice of words and shades of meaning, a careful brevity, a beauti- 
ful artistry, that make the written page a thing of art, and the reading of it a delight. 
It is not easy to prophesy regarding a book, but "Peter Paragon" is going to be heard 
of. $1.35 net. 



THE LATER 
LIFE 

By Louis Couperus 

Author of "Small Souls" 

The story is told without any thrills or 
throbs, points no moral, culminates in no 
climax. But by reason of countless minute 
touches, each laid on with marvellous ac- 
curacy and skill, the author presents not a 
story about people more or less real but 
the people themselves, real, living, with 
their motives, their characters, their hid- 
den springs of action laid bare. $1.35 net. 



THE OLD ORDER 
CHANGETH 

By Archibald Marshall 

Author of " Exton Manor, " etc. 

The plot centres about the Marquis of 
Meadshire, the last of an old and impor- 
tant family, who is forced to sell his estate 
to a self-made man of millions. The con- 
trast of the old aristocracy of birth and the 
new aristocracy of money is very cleverly 
brought out. And the novel has the same 
leisurely charm and the same keen delinea- 
tion of human nature which have charac- 
terized the novels of Mr. Marshall. $1.35

THE REAL ARGENTINE: 

Notes and Impressions of a year in the Argentine and Uruguay

everything that he sees interesting. Says the distinguished English critic, Sir W. Rob- 
ertson Nicoll, "It is out of sight the best book ever written on the Argentine." Illus-

By KATHLEEN NORRIS. Author of "Mother." etc.

glimpse into the Toland family she was content with the 
cheap ideals and sordid surroundings in which she grew up. 
But with that vision of home life Julia Page awoke. The

achievement of a courageous soul.

"Mrs. Norris puts the problem, or the fact, or the trait before you 
by quick, vivid touches of portraiture or action. She has the secret of 
closely adding detail to detail in a triumph of what another California

BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON. 

In the preface to his latest but we hope not 
his last book Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer takes 
occasion to defend his reminiscent and anec- 
dotal style by saying: "But readability, as 
far as I have observed its effects upon myself, 
has seemed always to resolve itself into relat- 
ing anecdotes and drawing morals from those 
anecdotes." The prominence given to biog- 
raphy and reminiscences in the book-lists ap- 
pended to this as to previous "announcement" 
numbers of THE DIAL finds ample justification 
in the natural and praiseworthy interest so 
generally felt by readers in this important 
branch of literature. And though the forth- 
coming books of this sort are somewhat fewer 
in number this autumn than a year ago, they 
include rather more works of unusual attrac- 
tiveness. For instance, what lover of inti- 
mate biography can read with unquickened 
pulse the announcement of the " Life, Letters, 
and Journals of John Muir," or of Maxim 
Gorky's " My Childhood," or of Mr. Richard 
Whiteing's "My Harvest"? Rather more 
formal in structure, one expects, but little less 
appealing, or even more so to certain readers, 
will be " The Life and Letters of John Hay " 
as edited in two volumes by Mr. William Ros- 
coe Thayer ; and the " Reminiscences " of Dr. 
Lyman Abbott, already known to " Outlook " 
readers; and, again, Mr. Putnam's "Memo- 
ries of a Publisher," being the third instal- 
ment of his notable autobiography. " The 
Life of Clara Barton," by Mr. Percy H. Epler, 
will not fail of a cordial reception at this 
time ; nor will the biography of Bishop Potter, 
by Dr. Hodges, fall still-born from the press; 
and those who of late have read with eager 
curiosity "What I Found Out" and "Memories 
of the Kaiser's Court " will turn with anticipa- 
tory relish to "My Years at the Austrian 
Court," by Miss Nellie Ryan, while the col- 
lected chapters of the Infanta 'Eulalia's 
"Court Life from Within " will give hours of 
entertainment to unnumbered readers. Among 
other promising titles in this general class are 
" Emma Darwin : A Century of Family Let- 
ters, 1792 to 1896," " The Life and Times of 
Tennyson," by the late Professor Lounsbury, 



200 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



" On the Trail of Stevenson," by Mr. Clayton 
Hamilton, " The Story of Yone Noguchi," told 
by himself and illustrated by Mr. Yoshio 
Markino, " The Story of a Pioneer," by Dr. 
Anna Howard Shaw, "Vagrant Memories," 
by Mr. Winter, and, in short, to any reader of 
broad sympathies, too many others to be in- 
cluded in so restricted a notice as this. 

Allied to biography, though lacking the pre- 
dominant personal interest, stands history; 
and here the eye is arrested by such richly 
promising works as Mr. Hilaire Belloc's "High 
Lights of the French Revolution," Mr. Nor- 
wood Young's "Napoleon in Exile at St. 
Helena," Dr. Knut Gjerset's " History of the 
Norwegian People," Mr. Edward Button's 
"Attila and His Huns," and the results of Mr. 
George Bird Grinnell's researches concerning 
"The Fighting Cheyennes: A History of a 
Great and Typical Indian Tribe." Also note- 
worthy is the announcement of an English 
version of Treitschke's famous historical frag- 
ment (voluminous enough to be a complete 
work) , " The History of Germany in the 19th 
Century," and of a less celebrated writer's 
account of "The Fall of Tsingtau." Dr. Mor- 
ris Jastrow's '^Civilization of Babylonia and 
Assyria " offers the certainty of solid satisfac- 
tion to scholarly readers. Among books of 
a less strictly historical nature, and offering 
promise of autobiographic touches, is a collec- 
tion of" The Letters of Washington Irving to 
Henry Brevoort, 1807 to 1843," edited by Mr. 
George S. Hellman. Another enticing volume 
of like character presents itself in "Some of 
the Correspondence of Sir Arthur Helps," 
and we are told that autobiographic revela- 
tion abounds in Mr. A. C. Benson's " Escape, 
and Other Essays." But this brings us to the 
gateway of another large domain in the realm 
of letters, conveniently and comprehensively 
styled, " General Literature." 

Here one notes " New Essays," by M. Mau- 
rice Maeterlinck, " Incense and Iconoclasm," 
by Mr. Charles Leonard Moore (no new name 
in these pages), "Visions and Beliefs," by 
Lady Gregory, " Ideals and Realities in Rus- 
sian Literature," by Prince Kropotkin, " Six 
French Poets," by Miss Amy Lowell, "The 
Modern Study of Literature," by Professor 
Moulton, "A Quiet Corner in a Library," by 
Mr. William Henry Hudson, and (dare one 
hope it contains something new to print?) 
"Interpretations of English Literature," by 



Laf cadio Hearn. " The Cambridge History of 
English Literature" reaches its twelfth vol- 
ume in " The Romantic Revival," the recent 
achievements in letters of a brave little people 
are related in Mr. Jethro Bithell's " Contem- 
porary Belgian Literature," Dr. John Ers- 
kine's treatise on " The Moral Obligation to 
be Intelligent" ought to be worth reading, 
Mr. James Huneker's "Ivory Apes and Pea- 
cocks" arouses curiosity, and Mr. Forrest S. 
Lunt will have proved himself a master of 
pithy brevity if his "Shakespeare Explained " 
(for only sixty cents) fulfils the promise of 
its title. 

In poetry, new and old, there is not exactly 
an embarrassment of riches. A collection of 
the verses of the Bronte sisters and their 
scapegrace brother is put forth with an in- 
troduction by Mr. A. C. Benson. George 
Borrow's "Welsh Ballads and Poems " is pub- 
Ushed*-in a limited -edition with preface by 
Mr. Ernest Rhys. In the "New Poetry 
Series " one notes especially a fresh volume by 
Mrs. Marks (Josephine Preston Peabody), 
entitled simply, "New Poems." Mr. Chester- 
ton has a book of " Poems," Lord Curzon a 
number of " War Poems, and Other Transla- 
tions," and a book of "Belgian Patriotic 
Poems," by M. Emile Cammaerts, makes its 
timely appearance in translation. Mr. Mo- 
sher's " Lyra Americana " includes as its first 
volumes : " The Rose-Jar," by Mr. Thomas S. 
Jones, Jr., "A Handful of Lavender," by Miss 
Lizette Woodworth Reese, and " The Rose 
from the. Ashes/' by Miss Edith M. Thomas. 

Printed plays are far more abundant now 
than formerly, and there are some good things 
of this sort for the armchair theatre-goer ; for 
example : " The Faithful," by Mr. Masefield, 
" The Immigrants," by Mr. Mackaye, Mr. Ar- 
thur Symons's " Tragedies," and Mr. Stephen 
Phillips's war epic in dramatic form, "Arma- 
geddon." Translations from M. Brieux and 
M. Claudel, with other by no means negligible 
pieces, enrich the list. Moreover, Professor 
George P. Baker writes expertly on "The 
Technique of the Drama," and Mr. Thomas 
H. Dickinson on " The Case of American 
Drama," while Mr. Vachel Lindsay's book on 
" The Art of the Moving Picture " should 
prove instructive and timely. " The History 
of the Harlequinade," by Mr. Maurice Sand, 
in two volumes with colored illustrations, can 
hardly fail to be diverting, at least; and there 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



201 



is no lack of other books about things theatri- 
cal, including guides to the attainment of 
fame and fortune by the writing of plays. 

John Muir's " Travels in Alaska " will be a 
favorite among the books of travel and de- 
scription, and " Kipling's India," by Mr. 
Arley Munson, will attract by its very title. 
" The Lure of San Francisco " will find many 
readers among Panama Exposition visitors 
and would-be visitors. Mrs. Hugh Fraser's 
" Storied Italy " offers evident attractions, as 
does Mr. Norman Douglas's "Old Calabria." 
Works of hardly less interest, though of an 
entirely different sort, meet the eye in glanc- 
ing down the list of books on public affairs; 
they include such products of observation and 
reflection and personal experience as Mr. 
Paul Elmer More's "Aristocracy and Jus- 
tice," Mr. Taft's "Ethics in Service," and 
Mr. John Spargo's "Marxian Socialism and 
Religion." In the departments of religion 
and theology, of art and architecture and 
music, of science, pure and applied, there is 
more offered to-day than was dreamed of in 
generations by our ancestors. Among other 
serious works, notable is the new group having 
to do with " The Great War," also the quite 
dissimilar section devoted to "Woman and 
the Home." . If the year's book-product should 
be found to fall, for obvious reasons, a little 
short of the recent average, its variety is 
likely to exceed that average. 

Finally, and in the place of honor on this 
programme of the coming literary entertain- 
ment, a word about the new novels. Selec- 
tion is too much a matter of personal bias 
to be indulged in without caution by a hasty 
reviewer of titles; but confidence willnot be 
misplaced if reposed in such virtual certain- 
ties of worth as Judge Grant's " The High 
Priestess," Mr. Galsworthy's "The Freelands," 
Sir Gilbert Parker's "The Money Master," 
and Mrs. Ward's " Eltham House." " The 
Research Magnificent," by Mr. Wells, "The 
Fortunes of Garin," by Miss Johnston, " The 
' Genius,' " by Mr. Dreiser, " The Little Iliad," 
by Mr. Hewlett, and "A Young Man's Year," 
by Mr. Anthony Hope Hawkins, are also safe 
ventures ; nor does this exhaust the list. An 
"Ivanhoe"maynot lurk between the covers of 
every proffered romance, nor a " Tom Jones " 
in every work of realistic fiction ; but the 
fashioning of pleasing imaginative narrative 
is not yet to be numbered among the lost arts. 



JOHN GALSWORTHY. 

When he just sits (to parody his own 
words) seeing Life and getting the full of 
it, those are the moments that I think are 
precious to John Galsworthy. There have 
been things said about him which implied 
that he offered no distilled moral (how clear 
and beautiful such distillations sometimes 
are!), no message, no regular conclusions 
concerning life; and such things are doubt- 
less true. To Mr. Galsworthy life is an ad- 
venture; he goes about or rather he used 
to go about "wondering with a sort of 
warm half-fearful eagerness what sort of new 
thread Life was going to twine into his skein." 
There might be message, moral, conclusions 
in his work, but he did not himself deliver the 
message, draw the conclusions, enforce the 
moral ; he left it to the public to do whatever 
of that sort of thing they might wish and be 
able to do. 

Yet at first his own feelings and thoughts 
were not much hidden. In earlier years he 
seemed very "modern," for he seemed always 
to press upon the reader the thought that is 
significant of our time (as perhaps of every 
time) : the 'difference between the new ideas 
and the old, between the radical and the con- 
servative, the lover of liberty and the believer 
in authority, the free-thinker and the tradi- 
tionalist, the bohemian and the citizen, the 
adventurer and the home-lover, between 
those, in fine, who believe in holding to the 
good and beautiful things that have come to 
us from the past and those who want always 
to stretch out to the new. 

How clear that was in the earlier books! 
The absolute content with received conven- 
tions and ideas portrayed in " The Island 
Pharisees," the stupefied self-satisfaction of 
the upper middle class in " The Man of Prop- 
erty," the entire enclosure in their own coun- 
try life of the landed gentry in " The Country 
House," the high-minded consciousness of 
the aristocracy that they Were the life of the 
nation in " The Patrician," it covered all 
the upper ranges of the social world, show- 
ing it everywhere self-absorbed and self-com- 
placent; its eyes blinded with fat, its head 
stuck in the sand (to mix figures ridicu- 
lously) , its power of action atrophied through 
the specialization of its powers of self-appre- 
ciation. We read such things painfully. It 
must be so, we think, in England ; and if it is 
so there (as this keen eye sees and records 
it), most probably it is so here. Just this 
much, however, does not make Mr. Galsworthy 
a man specifically of our own time, for to 
notice and record just these things has been 



202 



[Sept. 16 



the function of the satirist of all times. Mr. 
Galsworthy did something more. He pre- 
sented not only the immense inertia of the 
current life of our day, but he presented 
those who had the newer spirit. He showed 
both sides. Into this world of conservatives, 
home-lovers, patricians, are somehow born 
radicals, adventurers, wanderers of the spirit, 
bohemians. They strive against their sur- 
roundings, perhaps, and either are broken 
and subdued or somehow make their escape. 
At any rate they show us the rift. 

But if Mr. Galsworthy differs from the 
many iconoclasts of the day and of course 
he does it is chiefly that however much he 
may see of what is wrong in the present state 
of things he also feels keenly how much it has 
that is beautiful. And because he does feel so 
strongly that there is so much that is beauti- 
ful in this world which is yet not right, his 
thinking had a peculiar character: it was 
deeply marked with irony. He was not like 
Mr. Wells, who would cheerfully undertake 
the contract of remaking the universe nearer 
to the heart's desire. He would not, perhaps, 
even shatter it to bits. What would be the 
good? Hence his radicals, wanderers, bohe- 
mians were never effective people. Ferrand, 
Courtenay, Miltoun, Bosinney do themselves 
live, but they accomplish little for anybody 
else. Almost the only person whose acts and 
utterances we instinctively feel are right, 
though generally unintelligible, is felt by all 
around him to be crazy. 

Such was the earlier Galsworthy. Nor 
shall we think that later years will have 
changed anything so fundamental; only he 
need not say over again what he has said 
before. There may also be development; we 
may easily imagine that a man who first saw 
certain antagonisms in the social life of his 
time, will easily come to feel that such antag- 
onisms are fundamental in life itself. It is a 
necessity that there should be some such 
antagonism. And hence it is that the later 
books deal more broadly with the matter, and 
also more narrowly. 

His later books and his plays have not so 
much to say of the radical individual and the 
conservatism of classes. They do not even 
deal with the conservatism of society in gen- 
eral. They show, for example, how people in 
love come up against the institution of mar- 
riage. But perhaps it is not even this that 
they show; they may show merely some deep 
antinomy in life whereby people in love come 
up against, not the institution of marriage 
only, but the limits and possibilities of human 
nature and human thought as well. In " The 
Dark Flower," for instance, what can we 



think of the passionate love between the girl 
of eighteen and the man of fifty ? One might 
easily think that the man had loved several 
times before, and that the girl would prob- 
ably love several times afterward. And if 
such be the case, it will hardly be worth while 
to give up much for the present passion, 
or even, one might think, to feel it very 
deeply. It cannot be helped : life is often like 
that; we must, of course, be interested, even 
absorbed, but we need not be outraged. 

So much (yet how very little!) may be 
said of the novelist; nor in general, we may 
believe, would there be a very different im- 
pression from the works of the dramatist, 
save that, as he comes later, we shall not find 
our ironic spectator of the divisions and mal- 
adjustments of society engaged in viewing 
exactly the same things. Then the drama is 
more impersonal, more condensed; we have 
less or even no comment, or of that descrip- 
tion that goes for comment. Still the impres- 
sion is not very different: complacency and 
incongruity and rebellion in many different 
forms, but never an adjustment. 

And how about the poet and the essayist? 
Here, perhaps, will he be a bit more personal 
and tell us what he really thinks? Shall we 
not find in the poetry and essay something 
which will resolve the problems of the fiction 
and the drama ? I hardly think so. We shall 
certainly find the personal position definitely 
put, indeed so obviously that it is no longer 
any fun looking for it in the novels and the 
plays. It is like an arithmetic with a key, 
a text with a trot, a book of conundrums with 
all the answers. It is proper to advise the 
reader to be careful about beginning on 
the essays and the poems : one should read the 
novels and plays first to really get the fun 
out of them. 

Unless, of course, one really wants to know 
what is actually the case with life. It may be 
that one really wants to know the answer to 
this question of the day, this problem of mod- 
ern life, the difficulties of our social adjust- 
ment. It is often not so: one reads and 
reads with pleasure at seeing difficulties that 
one realizes in life, but without any real 
intention of striving after a solution of them. 
Solutions, answers, reconstructions, are diffi- 
cult things in practice. 

Nor, indeed, has Mr. Galsworthy, as we 
have seen, any intention of looking for solu- 
tions or suggesting reconstructions. More and 
more, as he has gone on and on, has he been 
content to see life and get the full of it. He 
writes about current life indeed, but he offers 
no " distilled moral," no " true conclusions of 
premises regularly laid down." He holds up

his lantern in the night of convention, or igno- 
rance, or indifference, or whatever else pre- 
vents us from seeing life as it is; and if we 
see thereby disagreeable things, that is not 
his fault, for it is not with us that he is 
concerned. 

Or at least so he says. " To set before the 
public the phenomena of life and character, 
selected and combined, but not distorted," 
that is one course for the dramatist to pur- 
sue; and it is so nearly like what he does 
himself that we may believe he speaks of it 
with approval. This method, he goes on, 
" requires a certain detachment ; it requires a 
sympathy with, a love of, and a curiosity as 
to, things for their own sake," and such de- 
tachment, sympathy, love, curiosity, it is 
pretty clear that Mr. Galsworthy has. 

It is not so clear, however, that he views 
human life and human suffering dispassion- 
ately, without prepossession, with equanim- 
ity, "simply as manifestations of life." One 
should select and combine but not distort, 
doubtless; yet some selection and combina- 
tion is virtual distortion. Take Mr. Gals- 
worthy's presentations of love and marriage: 
according to what principle of selection and 
combination is it that, in his work, love is 
usually outside of marriage and marriage 
without love? There may not be any dis- 
tilled moral there, or a true conclusion; but 
if it be not a distortion of the facts of life, it 
is clearly such an arrangement of them as is 
formed by a preconceived ideal. That is 
natural enough, nothing more so; only the 
man who views life in that way ceases to be 
a mere observer, and becomes something of a 
special pleader. Or take the question of the 
old order and the new: how is it that most 
of the characters with whom we sympathize, 
those who seem mostly to the author's mind, 
are the adventurers, the lovers of freedom, 
the unrestrainable, while the representatives 
of the older order are commonly rigid, nar- 
row, stupid, and generally rather ridiculous? 
Certainly we shall hardly imagine it any 
other way; but do not let us be cajoled by 
Mr. Galsworthy's suppositions that he merely 
loves and observes life. He does observe it 
and love it, but he has very strong feelings 
about it; and if he does not urge opinions 
about it, it must be because his mind is such 
as not to form any, or such that be believes 
them of no use. For a philosophy he seems 
to have, namely (if one can put such a thing 
into a sentence), that it is by an immense 
amount of pushing and striving, in all direc- 
tions and at all kinds of cross-purposes and 
by all sorts of people mixed up together, that 
the purpose of God is carried out, God, in 



fact, being himself the striving and the push- 
ing, the directions and the cross-purposes, and 
also the people. With such a philosophy it 
would be very natural to offer no solutions to 
any problem, because one solution is quite as 
good as another in the long run. 

And after all, life is a spendid thing. Mr. 
Galsworthy seems to have mellowed a bit with 
the passing years. He was never acrid or 
bitter, but in the older days he was generally 
ironic. Now he is broader in his sympathy 
or in his love. He has no villains; he has 
many who seem inordinately stupid, tedious, 
dull, narrow, selfish, but they generally have 
something nice about them for all that. They 
do all kinds of things ; they are hot-tempered, 
weak, silly, hasty, irrational, brave, loving, 
but never simply malignant or malevolent. It 
is a long time since we have had one who 
came so near the great satirist of an earlier 
day who gave us his view of partial evil and 
universal good. We may gather that in this 
case, as in that, we have more of a literary 
than a philosophic view; but that is a very 
good thing, for it is literature with which we 
are dealing. It is certainly no philosophic 
view that Mr. Galsworthy means to offer us; 
he will be satisfied if he can make us see with 
him

CA8UAL_COMMENT. 

A SURPRISING ABUNDANCE OF "BEST NOVELS 

IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE" is revealed by 
answers of noted living novelists to a question 
sent out by the New York " Times," which 
has invited these novelists to name the six 
best novels in our tongue. The indecisive 
results of any such investigation might have 
been foreseen, and probably were foreseen; 
but as a midsummer amusement the under- 
taking was commendable enough, especially 
when any wholesome distraction from the 
dominant horror of the hour is welcome. In 
the expressed preferences of a goodly com- 
pany of English and American writers of fic- 
tion, the only approach to unanimity is found 
in a considerable appreciation of the merits 
of "Tom Jones," and in a general , denial of 
surpassing excellence to American novels, 
except " The Scarlet Letter." One writer 
shows admiration for Mr. Henry James (no 
longer an American, it is true) , but laments 
that after " Daisy Miller " he " declined into 
logomachy" and so incapacitated himself for 
producing a great novel. " The Rise of Silas 
Lapham " gets an occasional American vote ;

but it is plain that, except Hawthorne, we 
have no novelist comparable, in the estima- 
tion of living novelists, with Scott and Dick- 
ens and Thackeray. Mr. E. Phillips Oppen- 
heim wanders strangely from the question 
by including in his list Tolstoy's "Anna 
Karenina," and Canon Hannay ("George 
Birmingham") impairs confidence in his 
judgment by placing " The Moonstone " in 
the same company with "Rob Roy" and 
" Vanity Fair." He also casts a vote for the 
innocuous and entertaining " Barchester 
Towers," while next above it stands " The 
Wreckers." Both the thrill of romance and 
the moderate titillation of an everyday story 
seem to be dear to the Canon of St. Patrick's. 
From the lists as a whole it is sufficiently evi- 
dent that there are in our language many 
more than six novels acceptable to refined 
taste and critical judgment. 



ENDOWMENTS THAT AID THE CAUSE OF GOOD 
LITERATURE by making it more generally 
accessible cannot be too generous or too many. 
One form that they might oftener take than 
they do is found in those special bequests or 
gifts to public libraries for the purchase of 
such works as might otherwise be unprocura- 
ble. The Boston Public Library, for instance, 
has trust funds amounting to $154,533, the 
income from which may be used only for 
books in special classes of literature to be 
placed in certain designated departments; 
also a fund of $121,750 is in its keeping for 
the purchase of books of "permanent value" 
only. Other endowment funds, more than a 
quarter-million in amount, are unrestricted. 
New York's great free library enjoys similar 
advantages, on an even larger scale. While 
the city provides the main building and its 
site, with suitable sites for the Carnegie 
branches, and pays running expenses and 
bills for the books in general circulation, the 
valuable special collections and the great ref- 
erence library in the main building are sup- 
plied from the Astor, Lenox, and Tilden 
foundations and other endowments ; and large 
additional gifts of this nature are received 
from time to time. Librarian Brett of the 
Cleveland Public Library, in his current re- 
port, deplores the lack of any such permanent 
funds for the prosecution of his work as are 
enjoyed by Boston and New York, and also 
by Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Paul, New 
Haven, and other favored cities. Cleveland 
furnishes sites for Carnegie branches, also a 
main building and the ground on which it 
stands ; but there the parallel with New York 
ends, since there are no trust funds for those 
other than popular needs which it is the 



crowning glory of a public library to be able 
to meet. Wealthy philanthropists might find 
here a hint as to one method of escaping the 
disgrace of dying rich. 



A STATESMAN'S LITERARY RECREATIONS were 
more wont in former times than now to in- 
clude rambles in the classics, with perhaps 
an occasional excursion into authorship on 
some subject of Greek or Latin literature or 
archaeology, or a trial of one's hand at turn- 
ing into English an ode of Horace or an idyl 
of Theocritus. Gladstone's Homeric studies 
were the refreshment of his spare hours 
through years of intense Application to the 
graver concerns of public policy and admin- 
istration. The Earl of Derby's verse transla- 
tion of the " Iliad," published after he had 
been twice prime minister and when he was 
soon to hold that high office a third time, 
marked him as a statesman of distinguished 
attainments in letters. In our own country 
an instance of able statesmanship united with 
classical and literary acquirements readily 
presents itself in the person of John D. Long, 
who died on the 28th of August. His metri- 
cal version of the " ^Eneid " came out while 
he was lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, 
and just before he entered upon his three 
years' governorship of that State. But he 
had written and published verse long before 
that date. A booklet, entitled "At the Fire- 
side," was made up of a selection from these 
poems. He was also author of " The New 
American Navy," "After-dinner and Other 
Speeches," and a history of the Republican 
party. A few years ago " The Outlook " was 
enlivened by Mr. Long's reminiscences, in 
serial form, and he could have produced a 
voluminous work of that nature, full of inter- 
est, for he had a remarkable memory and the 
gift of vivid and telling narrative. To his 
native town, Buckfield, Maine, he gave in 
1901 a free library in memory of his father, 
Zadoc Long, who, like his son after him, was 
of a literary turn, wrote verses, taught school, 
and engaged in politics. The late ex-Secre- 
tary of the Navy was within two months of 
his seventy-seventh birthday when he died. 



REVIVED INTEREST IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE is 
noted of late in England, where no interna- 
tional copyright law checks the free intro- 
duction of Gorky and Garshin, of Kuprin and 
Korolenko, and of dozens more, to the English 
reader in the form of unauthorized transla- 
tions. Just as the Crimean War aroused out- 
side interest in the empire of the Romanoffs 
and its affairs, with a consequent English 
version of '' Dead Souls " and "Annals of a

Sportsman " and other Russian books, so the 
present war is turning men's eyes anew upon 
the country so conspicuous in the struggle 
and so much less familiar to us than its west- 
ern neighbors. Hence the timeliness of sun- 
dry translations from the Russian that are 
now appearing. But a deeper reason for 
Anglo-Saxon welcome of Slavic literature is 
found by a writer in " The New Statesman." 
Mr. Julius West detects " a distinct affinity 
between English and Russian literature, 
closer than that between English and French, 
and perhaps as close as that between English 
and American." Certain it is, if booksellers' 
reports are to be trusted, that an unusual 
demand for English novels in the original is 
now making itself heard in Russia. Other 
striking illustrations of Russian liking for and 
understanding of English and also American 
authors are offered by Mr. West. England's 
present relations with Russia, it might be 
added, are so much more cordial than the 
relations existing at the time of the Crimean 
War, that a far warmer reception for Russian 
books may be predicted than that accorded to. 
Gogol and a few of his compatriots sixty years 
ago. In this connection let it be said that 
now would be an excellent time to arrive at 
some uniformity of practice in the trans- 
literating of Russian authors' names. Great 
Britain has at least three "authorized" sys- 
tems : that approved by the Liverpool School 
of Russian Studies, that endorsed by the 
Royal Geographical Society, and that used in 
the British Museum Catalogue. Until west- 
ern Europe can limit itself to somewhat fewer 
than eight different ways of spelling the name 
of the author of " Virgin Soil," there will con- 
tinue to be trouble and vexation of spirit. 


LITERARY HINTS TO THE VACANT-MINDED, 
stimulating prods to the vacuous visitors of 
public libraries who have but the vaguest and 
most nebulous desires in the direction of read- 
ing matter for (let us say) the approaching 
Sunday or holiday, are unobtrusively and 
effectively administered by means of sundry 
devices known to library workers. An open 
case of well-selected and externally attractive 
books sometimes confronts, with its eloquent 
appeal, the entering visitor. Illustrated ad- 
vertising matter from the publishing houses, 
with a selection of the most artistic or strik- 
ing paper jackets that protect and adorn our 
current publications, may occasionally be 
seen serving the purpose of lure and sugges- 
tion to the undecided book-seeker. In a cer- 
tain city library a thousand miles from 
Chicago the librarian has put on permanent 
exhibition in the delivery room a case con- 



taining, not "the hundred best books," but 
"one hundred books worth reading," dupli- 
cates of which are available, for circulation. 
Here, in bright array, the masterpieces of 
George Eliot and Dickens and Hawthorne 
and other novelists, with Motley's "Dutch 
Republic " and Emerson's " Essays " and 
Francis Fisher Browne's "Abraham Lincoln," 
and scores of other excellent works, silently 
extend their cordial invitation to each and 
all; and it is an invitation that is doubtless 
gladly accepted more times in a year than can 
well be counted. The psychology of adver- 
tising has taught the value of this persistent 
and reiterated appeal exerted by a skilfully 
arranged and permanent display of some of 
"the best that has been known and said in 
the world." ... 

WAR'S DEVASTATION IN THE FIELD OF LET- 
TERS AND LEARNING has never been so great 
as in this present conflict, partly because 
there never before has been so great a war, 
and still more because no previous war has 
involved to such an extent the foremost na- 
tions of the civilized world. A single news 
item from the Frankfurter Zeitung is illus- 
trative : " Oriental scholarship in Germany 
has suffered a severe loss in the death, on the 
battlefield, of three of its most prominent 
exponents, Dr. Erich Graefe, Hermann Thor- 
ning, and Ewald Liiders. Dr. Graefe, whose 
brilliant work in Semitic languages, and 
especially in the dialects current in Egypt, 
had already marked him out for a high posi- 
tion in the Hamburg Seminary, fell in the 
battle on the Marne; Thorning, whose in- 
vestigations into the Islamitic brotherhood of 
the Dervishes cast new light upon the rela- 
tionship of that order to Western European 
religious institutions, was killed at Esternay; 
and Liiders, a specialist in Oriental jurispru- 
dence, was slain at Vitry-le-FranQois." When 
the end is reached and the death-lists are all 
in, there will be a staggering array of talent 
and genius lost to the world. And yet we 
still hear an occasional voice raised in behalf 
of the insane delusion that all this slaughter 
will somehow result in cultural progress ! 


THE SIFTING OF LITERATURE presents diffi- 
culties and dangers comparable in magnitude 
with those encountered of old by that famous 
personage with the tongue-trying name, 
Theophilus the Thistle-sifter. Though the 
thick of the thumb be not imperilled by any 
such book-winnowing process as is attempted 
on another page, there is great likelihood of 
error of judgment, or of prophecy in this 
instance, since it is the books of the future,

not of the past, that are here run through the 
sieve. On far surer ground stands such a 
practitioner of the sifting art as the compiler 
of " Best Books of 1914," a list issued by the 
New York State Library as "Bibliography 
Bulletin 56," and containing two hundred 
and fifty titles in all branches of literature, 
with brief descriptive annotations. Narrow- 
ing the more comprehensive suggestions 
offered by the "A. L. A. Booklist," which 
annually presents one thousand selected titles, 
this shorter catalogue compiled by Mr. Wyer 
and his associates is the ripened fruit of a 
somewhat elaborate and wisely cautious proc- 
ess of tentative selection and well-considered 
elimination, as explained by Mr. Wyer in a 
prefatory note. Experts in all fields of learn- 
ing represented by the books of the year, 
including experienced heads of juvenile de- 
partments in our public libraries, are called 
upon for advice, and the result is a book- 
purchasing guide especially suited to the 
needs of libraries unable to buy with the 
lavish indiscrimination possible only to the 
wealthiest foundations. The Albany list is 
classified, and is followed by an alphabetic 
index to authors and titles. 


THE BIRTHvPANGS OF A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE 

are excruciating in the extreme if such agon- 
ies as the world is now witnessing are neces- 
sary for the ultimate evolution of a common 
medium of verbal expression. Dr. Frank H. 
Vizetelly, whose book on " Essentials of En- 
glish Speech and Literature" is reviewed on 
another page, and whose editorship of one of 
our leading dictionaries gives to his utter- 
ances on language a certain authority, has 
been interviewed by a New York "Times" 
writer on certain aspects of the war in its 
relation to speech. Noting a number of inter- 
linguistic influences now at work, Dr. Vize- 
telly took occasion to say: "You cannot 
arbitrarily alter the language of nations. 
You cannot establish a universal language by 
force any more than you can establish simpli- 
fied spelling by force. The extraordinary 
circumstances of the war, causing people to 
take a wholly unprecedented interest in the 
actions and speech of the people of other 
nations, have of necessity led them to use 
terms from each other's languages. And so 
we are brought nearer to a universal lan- 
guage, a sort of interlinguistie conglomerate, 
than we could ever get as a result of the 
activities of the advocates of Esperanto, 
Volapuk, or Ito." But there is far less likeli- 
hood that the civilized world will ever adopt, 
for international use, any such Lingua 
Franca as seems to be meant by this "inter- 



linguistic conglomerate" than that it will 
unite upon some one existing language, as 
English. Mediaeval use of Latin and later 
employment of French as a European medium 
may be regarded as indicative of the nature 
of future practice in this respect. 


BOOK-BUYING IN TIMES OF STRESS, when 
money is scarce and prices are high, might be 
expected to fall off. A year of war has passed 
over Europe, but in one at least of the coun- 
tries involved the book trade is said to be far 
from languishing. A survey of this trade in 
England for the last twelve months is printed 
in the London "Times," and the reading of 
it is by no means so depressing as one would 
have feared. Certain London firms have suf- 
fered, it is true, and many works of substan- 
tial value (and price) have met with a cooler 
reception than would have been accorded them 
in times of peace. On the other hand, cheap 
reprints and current novels, as also books on 
the war and kindred topics, have gone like 
hot cakes. And if the American market for 
works ordinarily published simultaneously on 
both sides of the Atlantic has been rather 
weak, the Russian demand for English books, 
especially inexpensive novels, has been un- 
usually strong, so strong as to direct attention 
anew to the desirability of a copyright treaty 
between the two countries. Our own popular 
novelists, those already in favor with English 
readers, do not seem to have suffered diminu- 
tion of that favor because of war conditions. 


A CONTINUATION OF THE TAUCHNITZ SERIES 

of standard works in the English language is 
now announced, after a year's suspension of 
activity. But the general character of the 
books lately added to the Tauchnitz list is 
not exactly of the old order. In July of last 
year the series stopped with number 4506. 
About twelve months later it was resumed 
with number 4507, " The War and America," 
by Professor Hugo Miinsterberg, whose work 
is described by the publisher as " a lucid and 
convincing description of the present war 
by the famous American psychologist and 
Austausch-Professor [Exchange Professor]." 
Number 4508 is "The Austrian Officer at 
Work and at Play, by Dorothea Gerard. A 
series of lively and clever sketches of the Aus- 
trian army, by an Englishwoman married to 
an Austrian officer." Number 4509 is another 
book from the ready pen of the "Austausch- 
Professor," " The Peace and America." 
New impressions of earlier issues are now 
coming out, it is reported. Will their authors 
receive the customary honorarium from 
Leipzig ?

COMMUNICATIONS. 

THE IMPERISHABLE ELEMENTS OF POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
As the quest eternal in the discussion of poetry 
has once more been touched upon, by Mr. John L. 
Hervey in your issue of August 15 last, I feel 
prompted to suggest a few ideas which have helped 
me in solving the question for myself. My refer- 
ence is to the communication entitled " Bryant and 
' The New Poetry,' " and to the writer's query as 
to what are " the perishable and the imperishable 
elements of poetry." 

Recently I was browsing through the chapter on 
poetry in Ernst Grosse's " The Beginnings of Art " 
(presumably a translation of a German work), and 
therein I found this definition of the art of song, 
which seems helpful at the present juncture: 
"Poetry is the verbal representation of external 
or internal phenomena in an aesthetically effective 
form for an aesthetic purpose." The latitude and 
the interpretation of this definition are indicated 
by the author himself in the following sentences: 
" Verbal expression of feeling need only take on 
an aesthetically effective form it requires only 
rhythmical repetition for example to be lyrical." 
" No feeling is in and of itself poetic, and there is 
no feeling which cannot be made poetic if it is 
expressed in an aesthetic form for an aesthetic pur- 
pose." Here we have the true critical catholicity 
or democracy, the tolerance of all forms of poetry, 
as I look at it. Objective ("external") and sub- 
jective ("internal") poetry, its form ("aestheti- 
cally effective"), and its aim ("aesthetic"), are 
all included. Here is reference to the essence, 
" the imperishable element," of lyrical poetry, for 
instance, " rhythmical repetition," in one word 
rhythm. It matters little whether we add other 
embellishments to that one fundamental or not, 
whether or not we adorn it with metre, rhyme, fig- 
ures of speech, alliteration, blank verse or vers 
libre, because " no feeling is in and of itself poetic, 
and there is no feeling which cannot be made 
poetic if it is expressed in an [any] aesthetic form 
for an [any] aesthetic purpose" (decadence, sym- 
bolism, the grotesque, the arabesque, romanticism, 
classicism, or imagism). It is the fine balance 
between undue restraint and lawless freedom, per- 
ceived only by the intuitively noblest minds to 
whom the gift of song or true criticism hath been 
granted, that we should doubly underscore here, 
and not any one " movement." I should therefore 
put the same thought in some such words as these j 
" Poetry is the free-restrained substance and pre- 
sentation of life in written language, capable of 
vivification by oral delivery." But the substance 
of life is quite generally conceded to be rhythm, 
either within the mind or without; and the pre- 
sentation of life is the necessary artistic illusion of 
greater or lesser degree, commonly styled form. 
When these two coincide in a unity as near as pos- 
sible to perfection, we have what might be called 
restrained freedom, the exquisite perception of 
which is what in the last analysis betrays the true 
poem to the mind inclined and gifted to realize it. 
This restrained freedom is a relative and variable 



essence which baffles definition, and which borders 
on the unknowable. It is, and must be, felt to be 
really known. 

In this large and broad field of pleasures, how 
puny and dwarf -like appear our " new poetry " 
pipers of one note ! And the little private gardens 
they have staked out, in all the wide expanse, where 
but so many flowers of joy are permitted to vege- 
tate, are they in accord with the all-inclusive 
spirit of poetic art? They and their magazines 
help us poor poetic democrats but little, in spite of 
all the tempting lure they dangle before us. Main 
emphasis upon a limited and narrow definition of 
the essential elements of poetry is incompatible 
with true culture or poetic criticism. The ideal 
lover and critic of Poetry should be susceptible to 
her charms no matter in what garb she appears 
among the sons of men. The breath of true poetry 
that passes over the JEolian harp of our hearts is 
not always of the same volume or intensity. I dare 
say there are many lovers of poetry to whom a con- 
siderable part of Bryant, and not merely " Thana- 
topsis," and " The Water Fowl " minus the ending, 
is of the divine essence, whatever it may be to a 
taste that can relish nothing except the green olives 
of poesy. And what poet is there who would not 
have ministered to the pleasures of the many as 
well as the few or to the many rather than the 
few? There are many poets who have just such 
immortality, but whose work has nevertheless an 
aroma from the Happy Isles, faint and evanescent 
though it be. Or are we grown so callous that our 
jaded hearts can no longer respond to this lighter 
touch? Such poets need never worry about the 
" living " qualities of their work, nor need any 
one else do this service for them. As for me, I 
hope ever to be broad enough in my appreciation 
of true poetry to recognize the Muse whether she 
comes in the form of a dandelion or of an orchid. 
It has always seemed to me something of a mys- 
tery why this poetry which some of our contempo- 
raries make so much over should be called " new." 
It ca.n surely be so only in the sense of new again. 
I have a faint inkling this moment that somewhere 
in the student-day past I was wont to grind out 
specimens of something very like the " new poetry," 
in my efforts to translate the choruses in the 
" Prometheus " of JEschylus, the " Philoctetes " of 
Sophocles, and the " Iphigenia " of Euripides, not 
to mention the "Acharnians " of Aristophanes. I 
refer here only to the form, not to the quality of 
these venerable ancestral prototypes; for there is 
nothing of the ancient grandeur in the " free 
verse " of to-day, as far as I have become familiar 
with it. Then there are the odes of Horace, which 
have some suspicious cadences in them that might 
have served as links in the chain of development. 
Following this, we come upon the "Antike" of 
Goethe, and the "freien Rhythmen" so successfully 
employed by Schiller. In English literature itself 
we find the same principle cropping out in the 
so-called " irregular lines," " short lines," " imper- 
fect rhymes," and the like, up to the "Lycidas" 
type and the " Samson " choruses of our own 
Milton. I do not know how others view these phe- 
nomena in poetic development, but to me they have 
appeared from the first as milestones along the 



208 



[Sept. 16 



road leading from the rude chants of the primitive 
poet to the product of the modern singer of vers 
libre. Of course there is not much to say as yet 
either for or against the latter, because it is still a 
ferment, and we have no definite means of knowing 
what wine of joy it may eventually bring to clarity. 
Some of it I enjoy to the full, but there is much of 
it which with the most conscientious effort I can- 
not fathom. Still I shall be patient with it, in the 
hope of some day being able to see the tiny germ of 
true poetry it harbors. The form, and most of the 
substance, is ancient, even primitive; but the sub- 
stance gives, by reason of its insistent mentioning 
of things of to-day, a promise of a universality 
somewhat akin to the contemporary allusions of 
the ancients, which have since become classic to our 
generation. Only some such view as this is com- 
patible with the democratic spirit of true poetry. 
We ought to be charitable to the " new," or the 
old-new, if you please, but we ought also to give 
and ask no quarter in our dealings with those who 
assail the old. The devotee of " the new poetry " 
may require a certain eccentric over-emphasis to 
make his message felt, but we cannot passively per- 
mit him to disparage and condemn that poetry 
which even feeds the tender rootlets of imagism 
and its ilk, which is still a part of our present-day 
culture, and which is the only kind of poetry that 
can be appreciated to the full by the least of the 
lovers of true poetry. Louis C. MAROLF.

THE COLLEGE COMMEKCIALIZED. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In his recent essay on " The Colleges and 
Mediocrity " in " Harper's Magazine," Professor 
Canby of Yale very ably discusses one of the great 
problems which have risen in consequence of the 
rapid influx of wealth into this country, namely, 
the enormous increase in numbers of those who go 
to college without knowing why, and the difficulty 
of handling the crowds and at the same time cloing 
justice to the exceptional man. I wish to set down 
here some thoughts that have occurred to me as I 
read the essay. 

With regard to the mere fact that the colleges 
are now besieged by the unelect, I am disposed to 
be, on the whole, optimistic. It is a phase, we may 
trust, and in some respects a passing phase, of the 
upward progress of mankind, and is distinctly 
more encouraging than would be the case if the 
masses, though increasing in wealth, remained in- 
different to all forms of education. The poet who 
said that " a little learning is a dangerous thing " 
himself uttered a dangerous half-truth; for how 
much more dangerous is that ignorance with which 
in the past men have been too easily satisfied, and 
which the demagogue has found so much more 
manageable than even half -knowledge ! Better, 
then, because safer, the mediocrity to which gen- 
eral education is bringing us than the ignorance 
which preceded it. 

I wish, therefore, to protest with all earnestness 
against that view of some college teachers accord- 
ing to which a few elect are to be singled out for 
attention and the rest unsympathetically ignored 



or frozen out of the class-room. The teacher who 
thinks thus, who does not give his best to all who 
have a right to expect it, had better quit teaching 
or else go in for "graduate work." To be sure, 
teaching the sixty- and fifty-per-centers is not fun, 
any more than teaching the feeble-minded; yet 
somebody must be found to do the work. 

But the exceptionally bright man needs, as Mr. 
Canby rightly insists, to be in a class by himself, 
where the dullards will not hamper him and where 
he can have the highest possible development. In 
this connection we find one of the baneful effects 
of " mediocrity " which Mr. Canby does not dis- 
cuss. Many of the colleges have fallen under the 
control of trustees who are not themselves college 
men or have lost the college point of view, and 
who, though doubtless acting with the best of 
motives, have not sufficiently large and enlightened 
views as to what the college and the university 
should stand for. Large classes are obviously 
more economical from a pecuniary point of view; 
hence a tendency to sniff at graduate work, which 
entails small classes and a large expense per capita. 
The graduate school, in consequence, is allowed to 
shift for itself; sometimes the professor is allowed 
to give graduate courses only after he has done a 
full day's work with the undergraduates; some- 
times a professor whose ability lies chiefly in 
graduate work is released in favor of one who is 
popular with undergraduates, and who is therefore 
less expensive. 

The diminishing of the number of good teachers 
is perhaps another direct result of the conditions 
which make for " mediocrity." The growth of 
endowment funds has not kept pace with the 
growth of student bodies; hence the necessity for 
boards of trustees to cut down expenses where 
possible, and to increase salaries only when it be- 
comes absolutely necessary to do so in order to 
keep professors from going elsewhere. What the 
result has been, every college teacher knows. With 
the relative decline of the professor's salary has 
come at least a corresponding decline of prestige, 
for the " mediocre " mind judges by materialistic 
standards; and now the bright graduate goes in 
for law or medicine or business, with only a con- 
temptuous smile for the plodder or the visionary 
who still thinks of teaching as a life work. 

What is the remedy? Panacea there is none. 
More generous endowments will help to increase 
respect for educational foundations and to make 
it possible for professors to live a little more 
comfortably. A long step forward will have been 
taken when college faculties participate in the 
work of boards of trustees, according to the plan 
suggested by President Schurman; provided, of 
course, that men of tact and real influence are 
chosen to represent the faculties. The formation 
of small classes, honor sections, and honors courses 
will do much. But none of these will wholly cure 
the trouble. Only the quiet, faithful, persistent 
work of all who believe that everyone should have 
the best education for which he is fitted can ulti- 
mately avail much; and those who believe thus 
must be active constantly in their efforts to leaven 
the great masses of the ignorant and the " medi- 
ocre." Religion communicates itself like the elec-

A FRIEND OF PETRARCH'S. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Some time ago my learned friend, M. Henry 
Cochin, an authority in France on Italian history 
and literature, read before the Paris Academy of 
Inscriptions and Belles Lettres a very interesting 
paper about a friend of Petrarch, which should, 
perhaps, be made more widely known in America 
where the celebrated Tuscan has so many admirers. 
So J suggested to M. Cocliin that he prepare for 
THE DIAL a resume of his paper, which he has 
done with great complacency. He was all the 
more disposed to do so because of his own and his 
distinguished father's pleasant relations with the 
United States; for, it will be remembered, M. 
Augustin Cochin was a prominent French aboli- 
tionist and a friend of Garrison, knew and admired 
Longfellow, and led in the movement which sent 
to us a national tribute from France when Lincoln 
was stricken down. The son perhaps I should 
say the two sons, for M. Denys Cochin, of the 
French Academy, is the brother of M. Henry 
Cochin has continued the paternal tradition; 
and some of his best friends have been and are still 
to be found among the best Americans. Before 
closing this biographical paragraph, I should add 
that M. Henry Cochin, with his brother, who rep- 
resents a Paris district, has sat for the past twenty 
years in the Chamber of Deputies, where, just 
before the war broke out, he was succeeded by his 
son, who is now at the front. But here is the 
resume : 

The dearest and most intimate of Petrarch's 
friends, the one who enjoyed his complete confi- 
dence in the matter of his love for Laura, and to 
whom he dedicated the collection of his " Familiar 
Letters," is designated by him under the enigmatic 
name of " Socrates." An eminent Belgian scholar, 
Dom U. Berliere, who was director of the Belgian 
Archaeological School at Eome, a few years ago 
discovered at the Vatican certain documents which 
enabled him to identify " Socrates " with one Ludo- 
vicus Sanctus, born in Beeringhen, near Liege, a 
musician esteemed in his time, Canon and Cantor 
of S. Donation de Bruges, and musical conductor 
for Cardinal Giovanni Colonna at Avignon. 

The discovery of the name of Ludovicus Sanctus 
makes it possible to identify various works of 
which he was the author. One of these is a letter, 
addressed to the Chapter of Bruges, dated April 18, 
1348, and giving an account of the ravages of the 
Black Death at Avignon and the pontifical court. 

A quite recent investigation has enabled M. 
Henry Cochin to discover a work on musical theory 
by Ludovicus Sanctus in a manuscript of the latter 
half of the fourteenth century. This manuscript, 
which he sought in vain in the Vallicellane Library, 
as entered in its catalogue, he finally traced to the 
Laurentian Library at Florence, under a bizarre 
disguise, among the manuscripts which Libri had 
sold in England, and which came back to Italy in 
the Ashburnham succession. 

The treatise by Sanctus which this manuscript 
contains is entitled: " Du Sujet de la Musique 



Sonore." It is an ingenious scholastic dissertation 
upon a controversial point of aesthetics What is 
the part played by arithmetical relations in the 
art of tone? The discussion by Petrarch's friend 
is not without interest. It shows that the Car- 
dinal's conductor was not only a practical com- 
poser but also a musical theorist. The discovery 
of one of his works raises the hope that still others 
may be found. How interesting would be the dis- 
covery of one of his musical compositions! 

M. Cochin shows furthermore the part played by 
music in mediaeval poetry, and particularly in the 
poetry of Petrarch, who always conceived of his 
poems as clothed with melody. Now no musician 
can have had more influence over him than 
" Socrates," whom he knew in youth at the time 
of his most important poetical productivity. 

In a subsequent conversation with M. Cochin, 
he dwelt upon the importance which a knowledge 
of the musical works of Petrarch's Socrates might 
have on the history of music in general. " One 
cannot exaggerate," he remarked, " the part which 
Flemish musicians have played in the musical 
formation of the whole of Europe from the ninth 
and tenth centuries down, but especially begin- 
ning with the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; 
from the time of the Flemish Guillaume Du Fay 
down to the Flemish Louis van Beethoven. Fur- 
thermore, in the fourteenth century, there were 
constant relations between Flanders and Italy, 
which are especially revealed by the enormous 
number of ecclesiastical benefices held in the Low 
Countries by members of the great Roman fam- 
ilies. This explains why it was that Giacomo 
Colonna, Canon of Liege, could draw to him and 
attach to the choir of his brother this Fleming, 
Ludovicus Sanctus, Lodewyek Heiliger, by the 
way, in Flemish." 

Two other points touched upon by M. Cochin 
in his paper may be mentioned here in closing. 
He gives a rapid sketch of the Campigne region 
and of the village of Beeringhen, where Sanctus 
was born, " prosperous and smiling before the 
recent ravages of the barbarians," and reminds his 
French hearers that it was at Beeringhen that 
Voltaire sought a refuge in 1739, with Mme. du 
Chatelet, who pretended to exercise manorial 
rights over the hamlet. THEODORE STANTON.

THE MICHIGAN DUTCH IN FICTION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On page 157 of your issue for September 2 
appears the following statement : " Mr. Arnold 
Mulder opens a new field for American fiction in 
'Bram of the Five Corners/ a story of the Hol- 
landers in Michigan." As a matter of fact, Mr. 
Mulder dealt with this same milieu some two or 
three years ago in a novel entitled " The Dominie 
of Harlem." Of course, to anyone who compares 
the two novels carefully, there can scarcely be any 
doubt that " Bram of the Five Corners " 'is decid- 
edly the better, both in structure and in bigness of 
conception; but perhaps it is worth noting, never- 
theless, that Mr. Mulder is not a novice in portray- 
ing the Michigan Dutch and their environment.

SENSE AND NONSENSE ABOUT 
BERNARD SHAW.* 



There still prevails, in certain circles, ' con- 
siderable scepticism in regard to the value 
of the influence exerted upon this generation 
by the personality and writings of George 
Bernard Shaw. But in the opinion of those 
who are accurately informed in regard to the 
trend of modern ideas in Europe, Great Brit- 
ain, and the United States, there is no longer 
any doubt, since the full details of his career 
and development were made public several 
years ago, that he is one of the most remark- 
able personalities and thinkers of our era. 
Thinking men and women have ceased to re- 
gard Mr. Shaw as a red spectre, an irrepres- 
sible mountebank, a privileged lunatic, an 
irresponsible jester. The most conspicuous 
feature of his career is now patent to the gen- 
eral public, that his voice carries around the 
world. While we may not now be able to com- 
pute the influence which he exerts, whether 
for good or ill, certain it is that he is to-day 
the most widely read international publicist. 
His pronouncements on matters of universal 
concern civic, political, literary, artistic, 
social, sociological, philosophical, religious 
appeal to the masses from leading journals 
and magazines in all the principal countries 
of the globe. Through the medium of his 
books and plays, he reaches and influences a 
considerably smaller, yet more cultivated and 
distinctly literary, element of the population 
in these same countries. 

The interest in Mr. Shaw's life, personality, 
and philosophy, which remained little better 
than amused curiosity until the last four or 
five years, has lately expressed itself in sev- 
eral books of merit and power, from clever 
extravaganzas such as the " Paradise Found " 
by Mr. Allen Upward and effective brochures 
such as Mr. John Palmer's "Harlequin or 
Patriot?" to more penetrating and serious 
critical studies such as those by M. Cestre, 
M. Hamon, Herr Bab, and Mr. Joseph Mc- 
Cabe. That " discovery " the dreaded dis- 
covery for which Mr. Shaw dourly holds me 
responsible is well on the road to realiza- 
tion. G. B. S. is at last being " found out." 
Mr. Holbrook Jackson pointed the way to 
study of the Socialist; and Mr. Chesterton 

followed with a mildly amusing tilt at the

Man, which may best be described, perhaps, 
as a commentary on Shaw apropos of Chester- 
ton. A climax, of a sort, is attained in the 
well-knit, closely reasoned "interpretation" 
by Mr. Joseph McCabe. In works of this 
type, the biographical paraphernalia are usu- 
ally employed as hereditary and environ- 
mental explanations of the development of 
the subject's leading ideas and theories. In 
this respect, Mr. McCabe's work is no excep- 
tion to the rule. The biographical details, 
virtually without exception and without spe- 
cific acknowledgment, are conscientiously 
culled from the authorized biography. The 
result is satisfactory, the needed facts being 
presented with Mr. McCabe's customary 
smoothness and dexterity. The remainder of 
the book which constitutes much the 
greater portion is an original, first-hand, 
searching study of Mr. Shaw, both in his 
writings and in his public utterances. 

A few minor matters are provocative of 
interest. For example, Mr. McCabe remarks 
(p. 23) : " Fifteen years ago he [Shaw] 
recommended to me as the first rule of writ- 
ing: 'Take the utmost care that what you 
have to say is correct, and then dash it down 
as frivolously as you can.'" Is this only 
another way of putting Mr. Shaw's dictum 
(p. 201 of the authorized biography) : "My 
method, you will have noticed, is to take the 
utmost trouble to find the right thing to say, 
and then say it with the utmost levity"?^ 
Again, in commenting on " The Philanderer," 
Mr. McCabe makes the startlingly inaccurate 
statement (in view of the very successful and 
widely heralded production, at Mr. Winthrop 
Ames's Little Theatre in New York City) : 
"It was merely produced [by Mr. Grein in 
the Independent Theatre, London, series of 
productions] in order to secure the_ theatrical 
rights, and it remains to this day, in spite of 
an attempt to revive it, almost unknown on 
the stage." This is a conspicuous illustration 
of the mistake of omitting from consideration 
or examination the United States, which is 
originally and fundamentally responsible for 
Mr. Shaw's world-wide repute as a dramatist. 
At times the freely flowing journalistic style 
of Mr. McCabe is 'marred with infelicities of 
which the following is an example: "The 
play exists, in fact, for the sake of the dia- 
logue, and characters of a higher intellectual 
type are introduced than in the preceding 
play." With reference to "Candida," Mr. 
McCabe remarks : " Yet the play was rejected 
in London, and not presented there until 
1904, when American enthusiasm had induced 
London to reconsider the matter" (p. 181) ; 
! while only a little farther on (p. 183) he 



1915] 



THE DIAL

observes : " It was only in 1904, long after 
it had been published that New York discov- 
ered its greatness, and London grudgingly 
patronised it." In this connection, it is worthy 
of remark that New York might have " discov- 
ered the greatness " of " Candida " prior to 
1904 had not Richard Mansfield, nine years 
before (1895), abandoned its production 
even after putting it in rehearsal ! An illustra- 
tion of Mr. McCabe's inaccuracy whether 
the result of carelessness or insularity is 
found in the statement concerning " Caesar 
and Cleopatra " : " The play has not been well 
received, and it had to wait a number of years 
for even a moderate appreciation." As pro- 
duced by Mr. Forbes Robertson and Miss Ger- 
trude Elliot in this country, the play was a 
success; and this episode accentuates the 
fact, of which Mr. McCabe seems innocently 
unaware, that a play's success in the United 
States, in the large sense, both artistic and 
financial, is often a much more important event 
than that play's success in England. Proba- 
bly the most ludicrous remark in the book 
though apparently Mr. McCabe does not sus- 
pect it is the following comment on "Man 
and Superman " : " It is fairly safe to say 
that not one in a thousand of the audiences 
who have enjoyed the play, especially in the 
United States, has the dimmest perception of 
its moral." My observation of audiences at 
performances of Mr. Shaw's plays in both 
countries has convinced me that whereas the 
English attend productions of Mr. Shaw's 
plays to be amused, remaining constitution- 
ally oblivious to the ".philosophy," American 
audiences, while welcoming the amusement 
furnished, are constitutionally curious in re- 
gard to the underlying purport of the drama- 
tist. Nowhere, not even in Germany, has 
Mr. Shaw the playwright been so widely stud- 
ied and so generally analyzed as in the United 
States. An amusing illustration of Mr. Mc- 
Cabe's inaccuracy in this case doubtless due 
to un familiarity with the original text is 
found in the title which he assigns to Mr. 
Shaw's burlesque on popular melodrama, pro- 
duced at Regent's Park, London, July 14, 
1905: "Passion, Poison, and Putrefaction" 
which inevitably leaves the reader in a 
state of petrifaction. I confess, too, that in 
this, " die grosse Zeit," the era of ravaged Bel- 
gium, torpedoed "Lusitania," and mined 
North Sea, I read with almost a start Mr. 
McCabe's complacent assertion (p. 121) : 
" There is no possibility now of barbarism 
overthrowing civilization as it formerly did." 
In the chapter entitled " Socialism," Mr. 
McCabe points out an important departure 
made by Mr. Shaw in a series of articles in 



"The Labour Leader" (March 31, 1911, and 
following) by the editor, Mr. A. Fenner 
Brockway. Clearly Mr. McCabe is unaware 
of Mr. Shaw's much more effective enuncia- 
tion of the same position, published in this 
country in " The Metropolitan Magazine " 
(Dec., 1913) . The position taken by Mr. Shaw 
is a model for simplicity of expression, if not 
of practical execution : Socialism is " a system 
of society where all the income of the country 
is to be divided up in exactly equal propor- 
tions." This is not a mere freak of opinion on 
Mr. Shaw's part: it is his final creed. And 
Mr. McCabe points out that identically this 
same doctrine was expounded by Mr. Shaw in 
an address at the City Temple, London, on 
October 30, 1913. Ideas such as these, fantas- 
tic, impractical, explain Mr. Shaw's ineffec- 
tiveness as a practical politician, and his 
almost total failure to wield any real influ- 
ence over the hard-headed, sordidly practical, 
workingman of Great Britain. 

Mr. McCabe, who is free from the ideas and 
illusions of the Shavian, has mercilessly ex- 
posed throughout his book Mr. Shaw's funda- 
mental error in confusing "illusions" and 
"ideals," the error underlying his "Quin- 
tessence of Ibsenism." Again and again he 
exposes the fallacies inherent in Mr. Shaw's 
"appeal to will" as opposed to an "appeal 
to reason"; and makes it abundantly clear 
that Mr. Shaw's theories vanish in a cloud of 
ineffective mysticism whenever the guidance 
(not the control) of "reason" is abandoned. 
Facile and astute in convicting Mr. Shaw of 
inconsistency, Mr. McCabe is guilty of funda- 
mental inconsistency throughout his entire 
book, in denying that Mr. Shaw is a philoso- 
pher yet seriously analyzing that philosophy 
as the key to, the keystone of, his entire lit- 
erary and social contribution! This is the 
crowning, if unconscious, jest of a very clever 
bit of interpretation. Not the least of Mc- 
Cabe's merits is his ability to expose Shaw's 
fundamental positions in pithy quotations 
which he does not blink on the score of their 
blasphemy, outspokenness, or mad impracti- 
cality. Typical of these are the following : 

" Popular Christianity has for its emblem a 
gibbet, for its chief sensation a sanguinary execu- 
tion after torture, and for its central mystery an 
insane vengeance bought off by a trumpery expia- 
tion." 

" There is no way at all out of the present sys- 
tem of condemning the superfluous women to 
barrenness except by legitimizing the children of 
women who are not married to the father." 

" Childless marriage [through artificial steriliza- 
tion] became available to male voluptuaries as the 
cheapest way of keeping a mistress and to female

ones as the most convenient and respectable way 
of being kept in idle luxury by a man." 

" The ne,t result [of our penal codes] suggested 
by the police statistics is that we inflict atrocious 
injuries on the burglars we catch in order to make 
the rest take effectual precautions against detec- 
tion; so that, instead of saving our wives' dia- 
monds from burglary, we only greatly decrease our 
chances of ever getting them back, and increase 
our chances of being shot by the robber if we are 
unlucky enough to disturb him at his work." 

The brochure by Mr. John Palmer, heralded 
as presenting " an astonishingly new Shaw," 
is the best brief interpretation of Mr. Shaw 
ever penned. But the ideas, with only a single 
exception, which it presents as descriptive and 
indicative of Mr. Shaw, are in no sense origi- 
nal being fully set forth in the authorized 
biography in 1911. Displaying considerable 
ingenuity in his attempt to impart novelty 
and originality to fully established views of 
Mr. Shaw, Mr. Palmer is entirely successful 
in presenting " an astonishingly old Shaw." 
These ideas about Mr. Bernard Shaw are, 
roughly, as follows: 

( 1 ) He is a deep, not a shallow, personality. 

(2) He is exceedingly difficult to interpret. 

(3) He is not an original thinker. 

(4) He is, fundamentally, modest about the 
greater contributions of his own art and 
work. 

( 5 ) He is, at bottom, profoundly in earnest. 

(6) He is a man of large heart and deep 
feeling. 

(7) He is not an anarchist. 

(8) He is an expert critic, with a phe- 
nomenally effective style. 

The exception to be noted is number three, 
above. I have always taken the position that 
Mr. Shaw is an original thinker, a man who 
has constructed and erected a definite system 
of philosophy. I challenge Mr. Palmer to 
make a respectable analysis of Mr. Shaw's 
plays without appealing to, and exhibiting, 
either explicitly or implicitly, Mr. Shaw's 
characteristic and invariable "philosophy," 
or view of the relations of men and women, 
toward each other, and toward the universe. 
Mr. Palmer has been wise enough to shirk an 
impossible task. Critics who have really stud- 
ied Mr. Shaw and his works at first hand have 
already succeeded in setting forth the funda- 
mental principles of his philosophy and justly 
credit him with anticipating or paralleling, in 
fundamental particulars, professional philoso- 
phers, conspicuously Nietzsche and Bergson. 

The real object of Mr. Palmer's brochure 
is to assert that Mr. Shaw committed a funda- 
mental blunder in printing his celebrated 



pamphlet, " Common Sense about the War." 
As to this, each one must judge for himself. 
The reasons which he gave me for publishing 
the pamphlet I regard as thoroughly sound. 
It suffices to make clear that it was perhaps 
the most courageous and sacrificial act of Mr. 
Shaw's career to play the . part of spectator 
ab extra in regard to a stupendous issue over 
which the dictates of " patriotism " were in- 
flexible and vindictive. Mr. Shaw once more 
demonstrated, and in a great crisis, his cour- 
age to voice common sense and to speak the 
truth though it would be absurd to deny 
that no little of his " common sense " was non- 
sense, and no little of his " truth " was error. 
Mr. Palmer has not made good his " case " ; 
as put by him, it is too futile and feeble to be 
dignified with the term " case." The whole 
" case " of England against Shaw is clearly 
put in the statement (p. 75): "Bernard 
Shaw, in writing this pamphlet, has done a 
clearly unpopular thing. Undoubtedly he has 
angered and estranged many of his admirers." 

The little extravaganza embodying Mr. 
Upward's dramatized version of Bellamy's 
" Looking Backward," with Mr. Shaw as the 
Rip Van Winkle in a realized Social Democ- 
racy v of his own invention, is described on the 
cover as " The Adventures of Bernard Shaw 
in a Shavian World." Shaw awakes, after a 
sleep of two hundred years, to find all his 
own ideas realized in actual practice. After 
a few typical experiences in this Shavian 
world, he characteristically becomes disgusted 
with the state of affairs, and impetuously 
heads a revolt of the anti-Shavians. It is ad- 
mirable fooling, but Mr. Shaw has already 
spent a lifetime in this present world heading 
a revolt against the Shavians.

INCOME AND ITS DISTRIBUTION IN THE 
UNITED STATES.* 

When a teacher has been summarily dis- 
missed from a university it must be that he is 
either incompetent or his teachings are dis- 
pleasing to the powers that be. Judging from 
the attendance upon his classes and the prod- 
uct of his pen, Dr. Scott Nearing cannot be 
classed as incompetent; yet he has been 
dropped from the payroll of the Wharton 
School of Finance in the University of Penn- 
sylvania for no assigned reason. However, it 
was generally understood that his teachings 
displeased the old guard in Pennsylvania.

The action was taken soon after the publica- 
tion of his book on Income. No mention of 
this book as the cause of Dr. Nearing's dis- 
missal has come to the notice of the present 
reviewer, and it undoubtedly was not the sole 
cause. But a member of the Board of Trus- 
tees has given out an interview condemning 
certain of Dr. Nearing's teachings, among 
them one, the injustice of interest, which may 
be deduced from his latest book. 

Putting aside the distinctions made by the 
older economists between landlords, capital- 
ists, and laborers, and the forms of incomes 
derived from rent, interest, dividends, and 
labor, Dr. Nearing divides income into two 
kinds, property income and service income. 
Naturally, there can be only two classes of 
income receivers, owners of property and 
those who render service. The former are 
classed as economic parasites, living upon the 
proceeds of other men's efforts. Modern so- 
ciety asks no questions about how they became 
possessed of their property. Ownership as- 
sures the income. 

The various industries have been examined 
carefully by Dr. Nearing to determine how 
much of their profits go to labor, how much to 
the property owners. The ratio of service 
income to property income in the American 
railroad industry is found to be about four to 
three; in the telephone industry, two to one; 
the telegraph, five to one; railway terminals 
(in Iowa only), one to ten; municipal utili- 
ties, ten to nine; the United States Steel 
Corporation, three to two; the Pullman Car 
Company, five to one. (But this latter com- 
pany has increased its capital from $18,000,- 
000 to $120,000,000 by the simple process of 
stock dividends.) Taking the manufacturing 
industries as a whole, it seems that about one- 
half the values added to raw materials by 
manufacture is paid back as service income. 

On the face of things, an equal share in 
the profits may not appear altogether bad for 
labor. Yet conditions are far from ideal. 
Taking $750 as the sum necessary for a living 
wage for a family of five, and comparing the 
wages received, it will be found that many 
fall below the poverty line. In the street 
railways of New York, twenty-five per cent 
of the geueral office clerks are below the line ; 
in the. iron and steel industry, out of 172,706 
employees, sixty per cent. In the cotton in- 
dustry only six per cent in the North and 
three per cent in the South earn more than 
$750, while half the Northern and four-fifths 
of the Southern men fall below $500. In the 
woolen, worsted, and cotton mills of Law- 
rence, Massachusetts, half of the men receive 
less than $500, seven-eighths less than $600. 



In all the textile industries of the United 
States ninety per cent of the men received in 
1910-12 less than $750, while sixty per cent 
received less than $500. Substantially the 
same conditions prevail in the paper and lum- 
ber industries, and the situation is not much 
better in the mines and quarries. 

The total wages paid by the American 
manufacturing industries, the mines and 
quarries, and the railroads amount to about 
$6,500,000,000. The easily traced property 
income is about as large, taking no account of 
property occupied by the owners. The 
greater part of this belongs to a few indi- 
viduals. The property holders have priority 
of claim on the products of industry, the 
bondholders first, the stockholders next. Our 
courts have repeatedly held that the owners 
of property are entitled to "a fair return," 
usually about six per cent. If the Pullman 
Company were brought into court the deci- 
sion probably would award " a fair return " 
on $120,000,000, all but $18,000,000 of which 
was paid into the coffers of the company by 
its patrons, while they were paying "a fair 
return " on the $18,000,000. What American 
court has ever rendered the decision that a 
laborer was entitled to a fair wage? Even 
the right to work is only an abstraction, abso- 
lutely empty until made real by the owners 
of property. Both men and property become 
old and useless. The owners of property are 
often safeguarded by charges upon society for 
an amortization fund, which makes capital 
immortal. When the receiver of service in- 
come grows old and becomes incapable of 
rendering service, his income stops. His only 
chance for immortality is in the world to 
come. 

Such, in outline, are the facts set forth by 
Dr. Nearing, and the conclusions drawn from 
these facts. They are unpleasant to the up- 
holders of the old individualistic laissez faire 
philosophy, such as the men who now domi- 
nate Pennsylvania, and it is no wonder that 
it was thought best to dispose of the author 
of such a work. 

Dr. Nearing's book gives evidence of care- 
ful study in preparation, and is fairly well 
put together. But there are some sentences 
in which the meaning of the author is not 
perfectly clear. A few facts connected with 
property income, perhaps of negligible impor- 
tance, are overlooked. The income derived 
from millions of stocks and bonds, which is 
classified as property income, really belongs 
in the category of service income. Such is 
the revenue derived from the $12,000,000 set 
aside by the Steel Corporation for pensions, 
which is nothing but a deferred payment of 



214

wages, or service income. A few other com- 
panies follow a like practice. However, if all 
items of this kind were transferred from 
property income to service income, the change 
would not be very great. 

A much larger and more troublesome item 
is the sum realized from stocks, bonds, and 
rented property devoted to educational and 
eleemosynary institutions. In one sense all 
this is property income; yet practically, all 
of it is used in payment for services. Looked 
at from this point of view, it is simply an 
item appearing on both sides of the ledger, 
and may be retained or stricken out without 
any material difference. Yet there is another 
point of view. The funds used to support the 
Rockefeller Foundation may be regarded as 
having been collected from the makers and 
users of " Standard oil." So much of it as is 
collected from the makers is simply that much 
service income taken from one set of men and 
given to another set performing an entirely 
different kind of service. Certainly this 
much, whatever it is, should be stricken from 
the total of property income, and left on the 
side of service income. 

In discussing the monopoly principle ap- 
plied to labor and capital, the author reaches 
the conclusion that the monopoly power of 
ownership, and not productivity, determines 
the share of the values created in industry 
that shall be allotted to each. If this be true, 
one cannot help wondering why it is that in 
the great industries about one-half the value 
added by manufacture is paid out as wages, 
or service income, while less than half in 
many cases considerably less goes to the 
stockholders and bondholders as interest and 
dividends, or property income. Certainly the 
laborers of this country will not admit that 
their monopoly is more nearly complete than 
that of the capitalists. 

But however much we may differ from 
Dr. Nearing on his views about the position 
of capital, we must agree with his conclusion 
that "service is of preeminent importance," 
and that " above the rights of property there 
must be placed the rights of humanity." It 
was a great misfortune to a great university 
to lose so forceful a teacher of such ideas.

EMERSON STUDIED FROM His JOURNALS.* 

"A new venture into a field from which 
biography and criticism have drawn repeated 
and ample harvests may avert the charge of

trait. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



impertinence by pointing to the fresh mate- 
rials in the ten-volume edition of the Jour- 
nals, 1909-14, brought out under the careful 
and tasteful editorship of Edward Waldo 
Emerson and Waldo Emerson Forbes." Such 
is the excuse Professor Firkins offers for his 
interesting study of Emerson. The excuse is 
valid, but the performance invites criticism. 
A generous use of the Journals has been 
made, but in some important particulars the 
"fresh materials" have been inadequately 
treated. This is noticeable in the case of 
Emerson's eight-page journal record concern- 
ing his choice of a profession, and in the 
copious records of Emerson's interpretation 
of Webster's "Seventh of March Speech" 
and the misconstruction of his motives, and 
in the several records showing Emerson's lack 
of appreciation of Lincoln prior to the shock 
of the assassination. On the subject of the 
Shakespeare-Bacon controversy, our critic is 
silent; the Journals cry out against this 
silence, as we shall show later. 

The book is issued in uniform style with 
the Journals and the " Centenary Edition " 
of the complete works, and is intended appar- 
ently as a companion volume or interpretative 
study of each. With respect to the well- 
known writings, the new study is the most 
thorough and analytical that has yet come to 
our notice. The first half of the volume is 
devoted to a sketch of Emerson's life; the 
last half, to a review and an analysis of his 
prose and poetry and his philosophy. The 
latter portion is perhaps the most interesting 
to the general reader; and the review of the 
essays, on account of their general interest 
throughout the world, contains the most valu- 
able criticism in the book. From this stimu- 
lating study, the reader will naturally turn 
to the other writings, and then to the chap- 
ters on Emerson's technique. This will be 
true especially of those readers who have 
heretofore known Emerson only through his 
essays, and their number is legion. 

In a review of the works, the address on 
"War," delivered in Boston in 1838, is not 
mentioned. In view of the timeliness of the 
subject and also of Emerson's later appetite 
for war, so vividly emphasized by our critic, 
we must regret the omission. It was in this 
address that Emerson prophesied: "War is 
on its last legs." " Trade," he said, " as all 
men know, is the antagonist of War." Cer- 
tainly trade and war have together prospered 
in Europe and America, Asia and Africa, 
since the time of Emerson's prophecy, as they 
never prospered before ; and Emerson himself 
underwent in the next two decades an entirely 
different attitude from that of turning "the 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



215 



other cheek, as -one engaged, throughout his 
being, no longer to the service of an indi- 
vidual, but to the common soul of all men." 
Professor Firkins fails to note this change. 

Emerson as a prose-writer is considered 
under the following headings : Culture, Criti- 
cism, Clearness, Coherence, English, Diction, 
Unbendings, Hyperbole, Word-Play, Meta- 
phor, Epigram, Condensation, Floridity, 
Rhythm, Polarity, Style, and Inhibitions. In 
the matter of coherence, for the lack of which 
Emerson has been criticized, Professor Firkins 
presents an ingenious analysis in vindication 
of the writer, but fails to note this significant 
passage in the Journals (vol. VIII., page 
463) : " If Minerva offered me a gift and an 
option, I would say give me continuity. I am 
tired of scraps. I do not wish to be a literary 
or intellectual chiffonier. Away with this 
Jew's ragbag of ends and tufts of brocade, 
velvet, and cloth-of-gold ; let me spin some 
yards or miles of helpful twine, a clue to lead 
to one kingly truth, a cord to bind wholesome 
and belonging facts." 

Emerson's poetry is considered under five 
headings, the last of which, " Star Dust," is 
dealt with under twelve sub-headings. In the 
section on Emerson's philosophy there are 
thirty-one headings, among them the fol- 
lowing: Experience, Logic, Sensibility, Uni- 
versality, Iconoclasm, Illusion, Possibility, 
Rhetoric, Idealism, Government, Evil, Moral- 
ists, Duty, Love, and Insecurities. Under the 
heading of Experience, we are introduced into 
the secret of Emerson's philosophy : " The 
secret of Emerson may be conveyed in one 
word, the superlative, even the superhuman, 
value which he found in the unit of expe- 
rience, the direct, momentary, individual act 
of consciousness. This is the centre from 
which the man radiates; it begets all and ex- 
plains all." 

In the concluding chapter, Professor Fir- 
kins attempts to show that the intellectual 
and moral development of the world up to 
Emerson's time was crystallized in him. "We 
wish to suggest that a larger arc of the great 
hoop which we call the universe found accom- 
modation in the soul of Emerson than in that 
of almost any other known denizen of the 
planet." But our critic says that Emerson 
"is hardly in the strong sense a teacher, 
hardly in the strong sense an example : he is a 
revelation of capacity, an adjourned hope, an 
unassured but momentous foreshadowing." 

While the book is a stimulating contribu- 
tion to Emersonian criticism, it fails to pre- 
sent the human side that the Journals reveal. 
While Emerson has suggested that it is all 
over with a hero when we have come up with 



his limitations, it is in Emerson as a hero- 
worshipper that we see his fundamental 
weakness. We can appreciate why it was that 
Webster in 1850 and Lincoln in 1861-2 lacked 
the potentialities of heroes for Emerson when 
we see such men as Owen Lovejoy and John 
Brown evoking his praise. Professor Firkins 
tells us that the growth of Emerson's respect 
for Lincoln was slow but sure. The fact is 
that in Lincoln, as in Webster, Emerson took 
slight interest, and he was disappointed in 
both men as public servants. Even after the 
Emancipation Proclamation, Emerson records 
in his Journal (vol. IX., page 557) : "You 
cannot refine Mr. Lincoln's taste, extend his 
horizon, or clear his judgment; he will not 
walk diguifiedly through the traditional part 
of the President of America, but will pop out 
his head at each railroad station and make a 
little speech, and get into an argument with 
Squire A and Judge B." Not until after the 
assassination does Lincoln appear to Emerson 
as a hero. 

But in the case of Delia Bacon (and here 
the material in the Journals is so prominent 
that we cannot believe the omission in the vol- 
ume before us was unintentional) the hero 
worshipped is not the poor misguided girl 
that came to Emerson for encouragement, but 
the mysterious courtly author alleged to have 
written the plays ascribed to the "jovial ac- 
tor." Shakespeare repelled Emerson ; Bacon 
attracted. And it was from his own essay on 
Shakespeare, in his "Representative Men," 
published two years before, that Delia Bacon 
received the inspiration for her quixotic 
theory, with her subsequent pitiful pilgri- 
mage and investigation. Let us mention some 
citations to the material that do not receive 
mention in Professor Firkins's volume. On 
May 19, 1852, Emerson records his first 
meeting with Delia Bacon. An interesting 
editorial note is appended to this record. 
Emerson gave her a letter of introduction, to 
Carlyle, and also one to Hawthorne, then a 
consul in England. In his Journals (vol. 
VIII., page 314) Emerson copies extracts 
from a letter from her, which shows that his 
interest is in her investigation rather than in 
her. Later (page 367) he records that he 
has been reading " Troilus and Cressida," and 
hints a discovery of Francis Bacon's author- 
ship of the play as the result of this* reading. 
In 1857, Delia Bacon's book appeared, and 
Emerson records extracts from it in his Jour- 
nal. Delia Bacon, as the editors inform us, 
"literally gave her reason and life to her 
work, which she pursued in great poverty 
and absolute isolation in England for three 
or four years." But Emerson does not make 



216 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



any comment on her sacrifice. His interest is 
in the subject of her investigation. Two 
years later, we read of his disappointment 
caused by the cold reception of the book in 
the literary world. But again his interest is 
in the hero of the problem rather than in the 
girl whom the problem overwhelmed. He 
writes : " In literary circles they still discuss 
the question who wrote Junius, a matter of 
supreme unimportance. But in the whole 
world no one discusses the question who wrote 
Hamlet and Lear and the Sonnets, which con- 
cerns mankind." Thereafter, we hear no 
more of the problem or of Delia Bacon. 

But it is in the eight-page record in the 
Journals concerning the choice of a profes- 
sion (vol. I., pages 360-67) that we come most 
directly in contact with Emerson's limita- 
tions. He decides against the law because 
it " demands a good deal of personal address, 
an impregnable confidence in one's own 
powers, upon all occasions expected and un- 
expected, and a logical mode of thinking and 
speaking which I do not possess, and may 
not reasonably hope to obtain." Medicine is 
rejected for equally valid reasons. He de- 
cides at last in favor of the ministry. But he 
has his doubts, on account of " want of suffi- 
cient bottom" in his nature. However, he 
concludes : " I judge that if I devote my 
nights and days in form, to the service of God 
and the War against Sin, I shall soon be pre- 
pared to do the same in substance." The 
" bottom " he seeks is the settled mind from 
which flows the perfect will. And so he 
regards the ministry as a starting-point, a 
refuge for self-examination, experiment, and 
decision. Or, to use his own words: "My 
trust is that my profession shall be my regen- 
eration of mind, manners, inward and out- 
ward estate ; or rather my starting-point, for 
I have hoped to put on eloquence as a robe, 
and by goodness and zeal and the awfulness 
of Virtue to press and prevail over the false 
judgments, the rebel passions and corrupt 
habits of men." 

In his quotations from the record of this 
period, Professor Firkins does not use any of 
the above material, adopting Mr. Cabot's 
abridgment; and of the remainder of the 
record he says : " The pages that follow con- 
tain much of interest, in particular the char- 
acteristic lament for the want of what he calls 
bottom, that is, of constitution or native self- 
command." He adds that Emerson's friends 
were concerned because of his "defect of 
physical rather than moral bottom." We sub- 
mit that the physical defect was due to the 
intellectual and spiritual hunger which he 
could not satisfy. This hunger created a state 



of doubt, of unsettled mind, that undermined 
his health. And from the quotations we have 
given, it may be seen that while Emerson had 
a clear idea of his limitations and a high sense 
of honor, no profession appealed to him unre- 
lieved of doubts. We are inclined to believe 
that the ministry was sub-consciously ac- 
cepted more as a temporary refuge for the 
future essayist than as the starting-point of 
a new religion or philosophy, neither of which 
he can be said to have established. He never 
did strike bottom in his intellectual and spir- 
itual life. 

Emerson was a great thinker, but only an 
experimental one. It would be difficult to 
find another who believed in the intuitions 
to the extent that he did. In stating his atti- 
tude towards Government, Professor Firkins 
aptly styles him " a peaceful and moral anar- 
chist." The anarchist is peaceful because he 
deals with social life as an abstract phenome- 
non. The human Emerson is difficult to find. 
But the human quality crops out in the crises. 
We have cited material which suggests this 
quality, and which Professor Firkins has 
either treated inadequately or ignored alto- 
gether. The Journals are also rich in other 
material that our critic has not used. Ingen- 
ious and stimulating as is his study of the 
well-known works, there is still room for a 
new estimate of the man based upon Emer- 
son's self-revelations in the Journals.

SLAVE-HOLDING IXDIANS ix THE 
CIVIL WAR.* 



That the Indian had a part in the Civil 
War most of us know, because we remember 
that General Grant had an Indian on his staff 
and that Albert Pike's Indians fought in the 
battle of Pea Ridge. This, however, is very 
nearly the sum of our information. But now 
Miss Abel, in her work on the slave-holding 
Indians, promises to open up an altogether 
neglected field of Civil War history, and to 
prove the importance of the civilized Indian 
natives as a factor in diplomacy and war. 
The projected series of three volumes will 
deal, we are told, with the "slave-holding 
Indians as secessionists, as participants in the 
Civil War, and as victims under Reconstruc- 
tion." The first volume, now published, shows 
the position of the Indians in 1860-61 as 
slave-holders and Southern sympathizers, as 
neglected by the North but valued by the

South, as secessionists and allies by treaty of 
the Confederacy. Throughout this volume 
Dr. Abel emphasizes the economic and mili- 
tary importance of the Indian country to the 
Confederacy, and shows that much of the 
Southern diplomatic and military activity 
centred about the great Indian tribes. 

The political and social conditions existing 
in the Indian Territory for some years pre- 
ceding the outbreak of the Civil War are here 
for the first time adequately portrayed. Of 
special interest is the account of the division 
of the great Indian tribes (Cherokees, Choc- 
taws, Seminoles, and others) into a ruling 
class of half breeds, wealthy, educated, 
slave-holders, and Southern sympathizers, r 
and a larger, poorer, and less influential class 
of pure bloods who were non-slave-holders and 
inclined to be abolitionists. Other internal 
dissensions dated in origin back to the evil 
days of the removal from the eastern South. 
There was intense rivalry between Northern 
and Southern church organizations and 
church-conducted schools, and there were dif- 
ferences between the " Old Settlers " who 
came before the forced removal and those who 
came later. Slavery everywhere existed, and 
the fugitive slave law was in operation. 
Nearly all of the Indian agents were natives 
of Arkansas and Texas, and used their influ- 
ence to keep the Indian Territory in sympathy 
with Southern life and thought. 

The influences which finally caused the 
Indian leaders to cast their lot with the South 
were varied and sometimes contradictory. 
The Indians charged the Washington govern- 
ment with responsibility for the removal pol- 
icy of the 30's ; they feared the Douglas policy 
of opening the western lands to white settle- 
ment, and the proposed removal of North- 
western Indians to Indian Territory; the 
Indian slave-holders were alarmed by the 
abolition movement, and resented the refusal 
of the Washington government to establish 
Federal courts and a postal system in the 
Indian country. When the crisis came in 
1861, the Lincoln administration neglected the 
Indians, offered them no protection, and even 
stopped payment on their funds; while the 
South, alive to the importance of the Indian 
Territory as a part of the military frontier, 
set all its influence to work, and convinced the 
leaders that their interests lay with the Con- 
federacy. Texas and Arkansas were espe- 
cially interested in the attitude of the Indians, 
and Miss Abel thinks that the secession of 
Arkansas was conditioned upon the secession 
of Indian Territory. The Confederate gov- 
ernment, fully appreciating the value of the 
Indian country with its 75.000 people, very 



early organized an Indian Bureau, with David 
Hubbard of Alabama as Commissioner and 
Albert Pike of Arkansas (formerly of Massa- 
chusetts) as a sort of diplomatic agent. The 
Indians were also assured of the safety of the 
interest-bearing trust funds which were held 
by the Union government, but which were in- 
vested mainly in Southern state bonds. 

During 1861 the activities of Indian Com- 
missioner Hubbard were of little importance ; 
but Albert Pike negotiated a series of remark- 
able treaties by which the Indians came under 
the protection of the Confederate States and 
received a definite recognition of their rights. 
The "civilized nations" the Cherokees, 
Creeks, Choctaws and Chickasaws, and Semi- 
noles were treated as protected states with 
political, civil, and territorial rights, and were 
offered the prospect of ultimate statehood. 
The less advanced Osages, Senecas, Shawnees, 
and Quapaws secured somewhat less favorable 
treatment, and the "wild" Indians the 
Wichitas and the Comanches merely agreed 
to transfer their allegiance from the United 
States to the Confederate States. All of 
the treaties secured the land rights of the 
Indians and their trust funds, gave to them 
courts of their own and a status in Confed- 
erate and state courts, and to a great extent 
granted freedom of trade and travel. By 
these treaties the Indians gained, Miss Abel 
says, all that they had been contending for 
during the nineteenth century. 

When the treaties were made, the Confed- 
eracy was in the ascendant, especially in the 
Southwest, and the Indian opposition to the 
Confederate alliance was slight. For a time, 
the Cherokees, under the leadership of the 
venerable John Ross, wished, like Kentucky, 
to remain neutral, but driven by circum- 
stances soon came into the Confederacy. The 
rivalries of John Ross and Stand Watie (later 
a Confederate general) and of other factional 
leaders played into the hands of the Confed- 
erates. The author is in sympathy with John 
Ross's views, but gives credit to the liberal 
policy of the Confederacy and the " fair mind- 
edness " of Pike. 

The results of the treaties were seen at 
once. Indian troops were enrolled, and the 
Indian Territory organized into a Military 
Department under Albert Pike, now a general. 
But causes of dissension existed from the be- 
ginning : Pike and most of the Indian leaders 
wanted the Indian troops kept in the Terri- 
tory for home defense, while Van Dorn and 
other Confederate generals wanted them 
merged into the Confederate army; further, 
it was soon found that some of the Confed- 
erate Indian troops objected to fighting

against the Union Indians. But during 1861 
and 1862 the Confederacy reaped valuable 
benefits from its well considered Indian pol- 
icy. It is announced that the second volume 
of the series will be given to a discussion of 
the part played by the Indians in the war, 
and to an explanation of the causes which 
led to the loss of the Indian support to the 
Confederacy. 

The materials which Miss Abel has drawn 
upon for this work are mainly the manuscript 
sources, hitherto unused, in the United States 
Indian Office. The work is carefully anno- 
tated, but is too heavily documented the 
work being at the same time a narrative and 
a source book. This fault, however, the stu- 
dent of history will regard with lenience. At 
times the narrative is unnecessarily discursive, 
the chapters are too long, and the plan of the 
work involves too much repetition. But these 
faults are insignificant when one considers 
the essential value and originality of the un- 
dertaking. WALTER L. FLEMING. 



EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CRITICAL, ESSAYS.* 



In the present imbroglio of impressionism, 
which is threatening the very existence of 
criticism as a genre, some of us believe that 
we can find anchorage only by a recovery and 
reinterpretation of a more humanistic view of 
life. Having recognized with a more clear- 
eyed tolerance the standards of seventeenth 
century classicism, against which Diderot and 
Rousseau so frantically and successfully pro- 
tested, we need to scrutinize with particular 
thoroughness the development of eighteenth 
century criticism, using the word criticism in 
its broadest sense. We are just beginning to 
realize that beneath the surface of all the ordi- 
nary generalizations about the eighteenth 
century in England there lies an important 
body of forgotten material, the significance of 
which we have missed. This we can no longer 
ignore if we are to understand the movement 
which began more than a century and a half 
ago and which colors our whole thought to- 
day. To such study, Dr. Durham's " Critical 
Essays of the Eighteenth Century" comes as 
a timely and valuable aid. Unfortunately, 
the editor has been able to give us only the 
promise of the material from 1725 on. We 
wish that he might have followed the admira- 
ble example of Dr. Spingarn in the three vol- 
umes of " Critical Essays of the Seventeenth 
Century" and of Mr. Gregory Smith in the 
two volumes of " Elizabethan Critical Essays," 

* CRITICAL ESSAYS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, 1700-1725. 
Edited, with Introduction and Notes, by Willard Higley Dur- 
ham, Ph.D. New Haven : Yale University Press. 



and given us the century complete. As it is, 
the promised volumes will doubtless include 
representative essays of the " original genius " 
group, which we believe are of great signifi- 
cance and which up to the present time are 
almost entirely unknown. 

Students will be disappointed still further 
in Dr. Durham's scanty Introduction. They 
will wonder that he has failed in this respect, 
also, to emulate his distinguished predeces- 
sors. It is true that he forestalls objection on 
this score by modestly disclaiming any attempt 
to interpret the period with any completeness. 
Instead he contents himself with a few gen- 
eral remarks about each writer represented, 
dismissing the need for further enlightenment 
with the declaration that " the one thing need- 
ful is that the student shall actually read what 
was written." Apparently, however, Dr. 
Spingarn and Mr. Gregory Smith believe that 
the student should be given at the same time 
as complete orientation as possible. In a field 
in which many scholars have gone astray, may 
we not plead for as much light as may be 
vouchsafed us ? And is it necessary, we 
almost hesitate to ask, in these days of Com- 
parative Literature, that we. demand some 
recognition of international influences? For 
all we can gather from the Introduction, we 
might suppose English criticism a completely 
isolated phenomenon; whereas we need only 
to glance at Dr. Spingarn's Introduction to 
realize anew that it has been singularly deriva- 
tive. 

In spite of these shortcomings, however, we 
may credit Dr. Durham with correct analyses 
so far as he goes. In a general way his dis- 
tinctions between the criticism of his period 
and that of the Restoration are Valuable. 
Nevertheless, he says : " If we are to escape 
from this position into one from which we 
may estimate the period more justly, compre- 
hend it more accurately, we shall not do so by 
means of new generalizations. Some very 
accurate generalizations about this period 
have already been made without much ap- 
parent effect." Yet Dr. Durham implies 
throughout the Introduction that we are in 
great need of a revaluation of the period. His 
first two pages show quite correctly that in 
our view of the "Augustan Age " we have been 
blind, hasty, and subservient to the judgment 
of the nineteenth century. It would seem, 
therefore, that we do need "new generaliza- 
tions " based, of course, on such documents as 
the author places before us. We should, 
moreover, like to have at least a foot-note to 
tell where these "very accurate generaliza- 
tions " may be found. " From even so cursory 
and superficial an examination," he concludes

that "none [of these critics] can be neatly 
pigeonholed as a classicist or a romanticist or 
a rationalist or an 'ist' of any sort. . . To 
group them is a help to memory, but a hin- 
drance to accuracy." We do need to be cau- 
tious ; but we need not evade the problem, as 
Dr. Durham seems to do here, by refusing, 
except in the most meagre way, to character- 
ize at all. May we not charge him with a too 
" cursory and superficial examination " ? 

As for the actual selection of essays, we 
must grant Dr. Durham the successful per- 
formance of a very perplexing task. Some 
will object to devoting one-third of the entire 
space to Dennis, but probably we must submit 
to this as a part of the recent rehabilitation of 
that irate and unfortunate critic. Some, too, 
will maintain quite logically that if Pope's 
Essay on Shakespeare is omitted because of its 
accessibility in Nichol Smith's collection, there 
is no need to include Addison and Steele, two 
men who are always with us. Only one omis- 
sion seems noteworthy, and that is Bysshe's 
"Art of Poetry," along with some indication, 
at least, of Bysshe's most interesting collec- 
tion of the best extracts from English poetry. 
Surely if Welstead finds a place, Bysshe 
should not be ignored. At the end of his vol- 
ume Dr. Durham has brought together a 
decidedly valuable bibliography. Here again 
only one omission is inexplicable: we look in 
vain for the highly significant works of St. 
Evremond published in English in 1700 and 
1705. 

The text is reproduced from original edi- 
tions with scholarly care, and is supplemented 
by accurate and serviceable notes. Thor- 
oughly attractive in binding and typography, 
the volume is all in all invaluable to students 
of eighteenth century literature and of criti- 
cism in general. j. p AUL KAUFMAN. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



" The Freelands," by Mr. John Galsworthy, 
is, as the name of the author almost inevitably 
implies, more of a humanitarian plea than a 
novel, or, at least, it is a novel so charged with 
a humanitarian message as to obscure its char- 
acter as mere fiction. A few words will suf- 
fice to set forth the complication in the barest 
terms. Bob Tryst is a laborer who occupies 
one of Sir Gerald Malloring's cottages. Being

a widower with three children, he wishes to 
provide them with a mother, and has what 
Matthew Arnold called a hankering after his 
deceased wife's sister. Now the Mallorings 
are good churchmen, and have decided views 
upon this subject. They notify Tryst that 
should he persist in his matrimonial inten- 
tion, he cannot continue to be housed upon 
their estate. When he remains stubborn, he 
is evicted, in consequence whereof he revenges 
himself by burning his landlord's hayricks. 
He is then arrested, held three months for 
trial, and sentenced to three years of penal 
servitude. When being taken away from the 
court-room, he makes a mad rush from his 
captors, throws himself in front of a passing 
automobile, and is killed. Around this situa- 
tion Mr. Galsworthy has moulded his plot, 
and it will readily be seen what opportunities 
it offers for the sort of special pleading at 
which Mr. Galsworthy is an adept. The 
pathos of it all, the appeal to pity so clearly 
made by the plight of the children, by the 
sufferings of the father when his home is 
broken up, and by the despair which fills his 
soul at the prospect of the years of imprison- 
ment these things are worked to their ut- 
most in arousing our deepest sympathies for 
the victim. But what would Mr. Galsworthy 
have? Is crime to be justified under such 
circumstances, and go unpunished? The au- 
thor would not say so outright, but what he 
does urge is that the conditions are intolerable 
which make such a crime possible. In other 
words, it is the land system which is to blame, 
the system which gives the landlord this 
power over the private lives of his tenants. 
We admit that such interference is injudi- 
cious, and even to be condemned in principle ; 
but, on the other hand, it is clearly a case of 
conscience with the landlord, to say nothing 
of legal rights. If such a thing as private 
ownership in land is admitted, the right of 
the owner to use it as he pleases is logically 
implied. So that Mr. Galsworthy is in reality 
attacking the right of landed property, and 
if one believes in that right at all, one cannot 
be much stirred by this indirect assault upon 
it, which seems to us to be lacking in candor. 
We are in the heartiest sympathy with Mr. 
Galsworthy in his detestation of people who 
seek to regulate the private affairs of other 
people, but the mischief that is dorie by such 
efforts is much more chargeable to irresponsi- 
ble legislatures and municipal councils and 
commissions and boards than to the owners 
of landed or other property. While the lat- 
ter have at least a sound legal justification 
for their intolerance, the former have only 
their whims and petty prejudices; and the

curtailments of liberty which their actions 
impose excite our indignation far more deeply 
than do any restrictions imposed by the own- 
ers of property upon those with whom they 
contract to make productive use of it. So it 
seems to us that Mr. Galsworthy's lesson 
might have been made much more effective 
By- the choice of a less dubious basis. But it 
is, of course, effective, even with this handi- 
cap. The author has never made better use 
of his extraordinary gift of feeling, of his 
keen rapier of social satire, and of his beauti- 
ful style. His real power is in his style 
rather than in his logical process, and, for our 
part, we attach less importance to all his spe- 
cial pleading and all the calculated ingenuity 
of his plot than we do to the single page (261) 
in which, forgetting his thesis, he unfolds for 
us the pageant of the seasons in words which 
almost persuade us to admit that prose may 
sometimes be poetry. 

Mr. "W. Somerset Maugham, a successful 
playwright, has turned his activities in the 
direction of fiction-writing, the result being 
" Of Human Bondage," an immensely lengthy 
work of the biographical type, setting forth 
the story of a young man's life from child- 
hood to the age of thirty or thereabouts. The 
following extract will show why it takes six 
hundred and fifty compact pages to accom- 
plish this setting forth : 

" When Phillip arrived there was some diffi- 
culty in deciding on which evening he should have 
his bath. It was never easy to get plenty of hot 
water, since the kitchen boiler did not work, and 
it was impossible for two persons to have a bath 
on the same day. The only man who had a bath- 
room in Blackstable was Mr. Wilson, and it was 
thought ostentatious of him. Mary Ann had her 
bath in the kitchen on Monday night, because she 
liked to begin the week clean. Uncle William 
could not have his on Saturday, because he had a 
heavy day before him, and he was always a little 
tired after a bath, so he had it on Friday. Mrs. 
Carey had hers on Thursday for the same reason. 
It looked as though Saturday were naturally indi- 
cated for Phillip, but Mary Ann said she couldn't 
keep the fire up on Saturday night, and with all 
the cooking on Sunday, having to make pastry and 
she didn't know what all, she didn't feel up to 
giving the boy his bath on Saturday night : and 
it was quite clear that he could not bath himself." 

The upshot of all this complication was that 
Mary Ann relented, and grudgingly agreed 
to Saturday night. Even this description 
leaves Tuesday and Wednesday unaccounted 
for, which we rather resent, since we would 
like to be told all about it. It is obvious that 
a writer who works with this method of de- 
tailed photographic realism can " go far," and 
the story runs to nearly three hundred thou- 
sand words. We began it in Chicago, took it 



upon an ocean voyage, and it was still with 
us upon our return. Nor did it prove lacking 
in sustained interest. When a novelist thus 
sets out to chronicle everything about his 
hero's life, he can hardly fail to leave us with 
the feeling of intimate acquaintance. But he 
can easily miss, as Mr. Maugham does, the 
broad effects and the large issues of a human 
characterization. The only thing of this sort 
that we get from " Of Human Bondage " is a 
most depressing impression of the futility of 
life, an impression similar to that produced 
by "The Old Wives' Tale" of Mr. Arnold 
Bennett. Our hero's life is not romantic. 
When he gets out of school, he tries accoun- 
tancy and fails. Then he tries art in the 
Paris schools, and fails again. Then he tries 
medicine, barely scrapes through to a diploma, 
and is in sight of marriage and a country 
practice when the book of his life is closed for 
us. Before this consummation, he has en- 
tanglements with various women, including a 
long and enslaving infatuation for a girl of 
repellent vulgarity a waitress in a cheap 
restaurant who graduates into the life of the 
streets. She, too, is an amazingly real per- 
son, as are many others whom we encounter 
in this narrative, which may perhaps best be 
described as an album of unretouched photo- 
graphs. The book is far from being, in the 
publishers' phrase, " compellingly great," but, 
allowing once for all its inartistic method, 
it is at least a noteworthy piece of creative 
composition. 

Publishers' advertisements of their works 
are usually to be taken with several grains of 
salt, but in the case of Mr. William Hew- 
lett's "A Child at the Window," we may allow 
their statement that it is "a story vivid and 
startling in its realism, and absorbing in its 
human and emotional quality." These are 
banal phrases, and often absurdly misapplied, 
but in the present instance they do the book 
exact justice. It is all of this, holding the 
attention close, and being presented in a fin- 
ished style that is grateful in these days of 
slipshod fiction-writing. It is concerned with 
the emotional career of Una Field, the daugh- 
ter of an English country clergyman, a vain 
and self-willed girl with a talent for music, 
who appeals to us by her sheer femininity, 
and does not lose her hold upon our sympa- 
thies either through her obvious faults, or 
through the misstep that wrecks her life al- 
most beyond recovery. Taken in charge by 
her wealthy godmother, she is sent to a 
girls' private school, and then brought to Lon- 
don for music lessons and society. She gets 
mixed up with a set of men and women who 
chatter about art and the rights of the soul

in accordance with the most " advanced " 
ideas, and is so captivated by one of the male 
rhetoricians of this circle, that she runs away 
with him, and lives for a time in Italy and 
Egypt in defiance of all the conventions. 
When the rupture comes, it is not accom- 
panied by any conviction of sin on her part, 
but merely results from the discovery that 
her lover is an egotistic sensualist, whose 
nature demands a greater variety of emo- 
tional life than one woman can offer him. 
Since Una is an idealist even in her errancy, 
she leaves him, returns to England, and has 
a very hard time trying to support herself. 
Under the guidance of an old school friehd, 
she experiments with la vie des coulisses, but 
is repelled by its sordid vulgarity. After 
skating over much very thin ice, she takes 
refuge in the arms of a curate who has been 
her dog-like follower since childhood. But 
even in this haven she becomes obsessed by 
an infatuation for one of her husband's 
fellow-clergymen, who cultivates asceticism 
upon a basis of sensuality, and she all but 
succumbs to the temptation. On the whole, 
we cannot approve of Una, although we are 
charmed by her, and cannot deny the fact that 
there is an element of specious immorality in 
the author's portrayal of her character. 

The old-fashioned flavor characteristic of 
" The House of Merrilees," by Mr. Archibald 
Marshall, will not be the least of its com- 
mendations to the judicious. That the story 
will prove popular by virtue of this quality 
we are far from sure, for the sophisticated 
modern taste demands " smartness," and a 
staccato-like emphasis of "points," and a 
large field for inference or guesswork, and 
a realism which knows not reticence. These 
and other popularly desiderated qualities are 
conspicuously missing from the present ex- 
ample of the old plodding school of fiction. 
There is a mystery, but it is really cleared up, 
without leaving any loose ends to puzzle us at 
the close. There are no dallyings with vice, 
and no attempts to undermine the ethical 
bases of society. And there is a homely sim- 
plicity about the narrative which offers a 
welcome relief from the " cleverness " and 
the super-subtle psychologizing of so many 
of our young writers. The material of the 
story is as old-fashioned as its manner. There 
is an aristocratic recluse, there is the mystery 
of the disappearance of his body and of the 
immense treasure he is known to have left at 
his death, and there is the romance of his 
reputed heir, and the final identification of 
the son who at last comes into the inheritance. 
The story is nowhere very exciting, but it is 
everywhere steadily and increasingly inter- 



esting, whieh should be enough for any reader 
who is not hopelessly hypnotized by the spe- 
cious devices of the modernist.

NOTES ONJHEW NOVELS. 

Two new historical novels from the pen of Miss 
Marjorie Bowen deal with peoples and epochs in 
abrupt contrast, yet with equal success. " The 
Carnival of Florence" concerns itself with Savo- 
narola and the sons of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and 
is shot through with a vivid love story or two. It 
is notable in that it gives no unrestrained praise 
to the fanatic preacher who sought to dominate 
Florence, and even more so in the fine common 
sense with which it depicts the two chief romantic 
characters. The other story, " Prince and Heretic," 
has for its protagonist the William of Orange who 
founded the gallant little kingdom of the Nether- 
lands, and it occupies itself with the religious wars 
which our own age has lived to see completely 
superseded by wars of nationality. The subordi- 
nated love story is here again presented in quiet 
relief to the troublous times, though it remains 
unrequited at the close. Miss Bowen's methods 
are thorough, and her assimilation of her material 
leaves little to be desired. (Button.) 

Cape Cod, that ancient home of persons whose 
angles have not been worn smooth by too much 
contact with their fellows, is the scene of Mrs. 
Sarah Ware Bassett's " The Taming of Zenas 
Henry " (Doran). The protagonist is a queer fish, 
an old bachelor who succumbs to some comfortable 
lure in his neighbor, Abbie Howlands, but not in 
the least to her physical attractiveness. They 
marry, and three old salts descend upon their sim- 
ple menage. After much tribulation, these other 
queer fish succeed in justifying their existence, 
and in the process the reader surmises that Zenas 
and his wife learn to love one another. The book 
is amusing, and at times touching; but it hardly 
makes an almost impossible situation plausible. 

A more than ordinarily shrewd study of femi- 
nine character has been made by Mrs. David G. 
Ritchie in "Two Sinners" (Button), a novel of a 
circumscribed section of English life. The hero- 
ine engages herself to a man who in character 
mingles a certain coarseness with a rather full 
comprehension of music and art. Her pretty sis- 
ter's betrothal shortly after to a man more nearly 
to her liking confuses her ideas, and her own 
engagement is broken. It takes tragedy to open 
her eyes to the worth of the man she has rejected. 
Incidentally, the book contains a pen portrait of a 
disagreeable pet dog, which will commend itself to 
all who have suffered from that variety of beast. 
The sociological interest of Mr. Howard Vin- 
cent O'Brien's first novel persists in his second, in 
the title of which newspaper men, telegraph opera- 
tors, and printers will recognize a familiar word 
"Thirty" (Bodd, Mead & Co.) The subject it 
deals with is the old one of a daily journal which 
seeks to tell the truth in its news columns, and fails 



222

[ Sept. 16 



owing to the imperfections of human nature. That 
tragedy should come in the wake of the experiment 
is made reasonable, though it wrecks the romance 
of the leading characters. The book is sincere, 
though rather hard on the rich and kind to the 
poor, and it represents a distinct advance upon its 
predecessor. 

" Mickey has the best of three or four boys con- 
cealed in his lean person " says Mrs. Gene Strat- 
ton-Porter of the titular character in her " Michael 
O'Halloran" (Doubleday, Page & Co.). Mickey 
is, in other words, a super-boy. The young lady 
of the tale is likewise a super-young-lady. The 
multimillionairess is a perfectly dreadful person 
until reformed by the young lady and so on. 
The dialogue of the book is largely in a new lan- 
guage super-persons must speak super-language, 
of course. Dealing entirely in hyperbole, with the 
ill-behaved persons rich and the well-behaved poor, 
the book seems destined to a wide popularity. 

As accurate as a daguerreotype, which it re- 
sembles in period as in other respects, Mrs. Amelia 
E. Barr's " The Measure of a Man " (Appleton) is 
an interesting survival of Victorian manners and 
habits of thought and writing, with a dash of 
preaching against the limitation of the size of 
families which would make the good people of that 
era gasp. Not half enough is made of the self- 
sacrifice of the operatives in the British cotton 
mills during the war between the States, which 
ought to have been made a lesson to many Amer- 
icans in the present war for the freedom of nations, 
as that was for freedom from chattel slavery. 

Dividing his attention between drama and fic- 
tion, Mr. St. John G. Ervine seems to acquire skill 
from his dual activities. "Alice and a Family" 
(Macmillan) is written with a secure sense of 
dramatic values, and with a great deal of dialogue 
rather dramatic than literary in its character. It 
tells of a boy and girl in the humblest walks of 
English life, and the diplomatic manner in which 
Alice takes up the bereaved family of the young 
fellow and knits its tangled ends with those of her 
mother and herself, until the unhappy fates are 
completely propitiated. The book abounds with 
the truest humor, often near to tears. 

Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim is an expert in 
melodrama, and his latest story, " The Way of 
These Women" (Little, Brown & Co.), is fully 
melodramatic. It opens with the scene set for the 
murder of a British marquis, and the heroine is so 
strongly suspected of the crime that she loses her 
chance to wed an English gentleman who writes 
plays in which she acts. A well bred woman with 
the heart of an adventuress manages to marry him 
instead. Well contrived, without pretension, inter- 
estingly written according to an ascertained 
formula, and filled with suspense until the end, the 
book is bound to amuse its readers. 

The redoubtable Fu-Manchu does not appear in 
Mr. Sax Rohmer's latest collection of weird ad- 
ventures, "The Yellow Claw" (McBride, Nast & 
Co.), but his racial and spiritual twin, one Dr. 
King, seems to be the moving force throughout 
the book, though he does not once disclose him- 
self or his identity. Opium smoking is the propa- 



ganda of this mysterious wretch, who bends a curi- 
ous variety of Orientals and Europeans to his 
purpose. The story abounds in thrills and bizarre 
complications, but does not attain subtlety either 
in plot or character. 

So important a part do physicians and trained 
nurses play in modern life that they deserve the 
best that can be done for them in the realm of 
fiction. Mrs. Mary Roberts Rinehart's " K " 
(Houghton) has physicians for hero and rejected 
lover, and trained nurses for heroine and adven- 
turess. All these characters are drawn with a 
patient and scrupulous fidelity to the admirable 
qualities of two fine and ennobling professions, 
coupled with demonstration that a common human- 
ity^ is still alive in them. The narrative is some- 
what jerky in movement, but it keeps its interest 
in spite of a foregone conclusion. 

In the Baroness Orczy's latest story of Hungary, 
"A Bride of the Plains" (Doran), a careful and 
painstaking picture is painted of rural life as a 
background to a complicated and tragic plot. The 
maiden heroine is affianced to a man not of her 
own choice, after the supposed death of her lover 
jiuring military service. He returns on the eve 
of her marriage, and finds the prospective bride- 
groom much too attentive to a young Jewish girl, 
who in turn is affianced to one of her own race. 
The story contrives to end happily, though the 
reader feels that such an ending is not fully 
justified. 

The lure of the sea takes a young, lad with 
sailors' blood in his veins out of an office and 
sets him before the mast, in " The Lady Aft " 
(Small, Maynard & Co.), by Mr. Richard 
Matthews Hallet. There is a beautiful girl aboard, 
the captain's daughter. What ensues is the con- 
ventional thing: the young fellow finds himself 
among rough men, wins his fight, and finds due 
favor in the young lady's eyes at the end. But 
the manner of telling all this is decidedly uncon- 
ventional.

charge that the American press is delib-

generous acknowledgment is characteristic of 
Dr. von Mach's effort to avoid rancor and 
to practise the gentler arts of persuasion.

titious defence of Germany is mildness itself

full heart, and the reader must respect the 
sincerity of his feelings. Unfortunately the 
logic of his arguments is by no means so con- 
vincing. His specialty seems to be the avoid- 
ance of the main points of controversy, and 
a meticulous hairsplitting of non-essentials. 
Typical of his method is his treatment of Sir 
Edward Grey, whom he pursues industriously 
through various chapters of the book, en- 
deavoring to magnify petty discrepancies be- 
tween the English Blue Book and the French 
Yellow Book into something portentous, all 
the while ignoring the great outstanding fact 
that Sir Edward's plan for a conference, 
which would have virtually assured peace, 
was thwarted by the brusque refusal of Ger- 
many and Austria. Professor Ellery Stowell 
has recently affirmed that Sir Edward Grey 
deserves the Nobel prize for his unremitting 
efforts toward peace during that last' crucial 
week of July, 1914; yet the Germans con- 
tinue to pour the vials of their wrath upon 
his head, presumably because he is the one 
who put them in the wrong before the eyes 
of the world. Equally unsuccessful is the 
author's handling of the Belgian matter, 
about which, indeed, a well-advised German 
apologist will say as little as possible. It 
should be added that the letter of Dr. Cony- 
beare reprinted on pages 392-400 has been 
totally repudiated by its writer, who tried in 
vain to prevent its being published. In fair- 
ness, therefore, it ought not to be printed 
here or elsewhere. 



M ~~- f first minister to Persia, 

Memories of 

an artist, author, Samuel G. W. Benjamin, who 
iat - died last summer in his seventy- 
eighth year, left behind him a rich sheaf of 
autobiographic memories which have since 
been published under the title, " The Life and 
Adventures of a Free Lance," with a preface 
by Mrs. Benjamin, who says of her variously 
gifted husband : "To paint, to write, or to work 
solely for fortune or fame, ever stirred him 
to indignant protest. He loved things noble, 
free and untrammeled." A fine freedom, a 
refreshing independence of convention, with 
an earnest seeking of truth for authority 
rather than authority for truth, are apparent 
on almost every page of these varied recol- 
lections of life in many lands and in sundry 
callings. Born at Argos, son of an American 
foreign missionary who saw service at Athens, 
Smyrna, Trebizond, and Constantinople, be- 
fore death cut short his activities, the author 
was sent to this country for the completion of 
his schooling, and naturally enough it was to 
Williams College, the cradle of American for- 
eign missions, that the father sent him. That 



was in the good old days of President Mark 
Hopkins and "Prof. Al," as his brother was 
nicknamed by the students, and the author's 
glowing memories of Dr. Hopkins form a 
noteworthy feature of the book. All that he 
says of him as an educator and as a moral and 
spiritual force is indisputable; but, with a 
vivid recollection of him both at the teacher's 
desk and in the pulpit and on the platform, it 
seems to us excessive praise, or misapplied 
praise, to call him " one of the greatest orators 
of this or any other age." Mr. Benjamin 
began to write for publication early in his 
college course, and many poems as well as 
numerous prose articles and books came from 
his pen as the years passed. School-teaching, 
an assistant librarianship at the New York 
State Library, art studies, and the successful 
pursuit of painting as a profession, with 
diplomatic activities in the East in later life 
such were his interests and his labors after 
leaving college in 1859, in addition to his 
writing and lecturing and extensive trav- 
elling. Forty-five times he crossed the ocean 
which he learned to paint so well, and he was 
always a lover of the sea and all that apper- 
tains thereto. His style as a writer is in 
harmony with the free and adventurous spirit 
of a born sailor. Characteristic, too, one may 
venture to add, are the very lapses and errors 
which a critical reader might feel tempted to 
point out in the book. For example, a careful 
revision of his work would doubtless have re- 
sulted in the correction of such palpable mis- 
takes as " an unusual phenomena," " delib- 
erate assemblies," "Burrows" (as the name 
of our famous naturalist), "sharp sarcasm 
and infective," and other blemishes that mar 
the page and distract attention. Two por- 
traits of the author, a list of his books and of 
his principal paintings, and a few illustra- 
tions of his style as a poet, are given. In 
later years Mr. Benjamin made his home at 
Burlington, Vermont, and it is there that his 
last book is published, by the Free Press 
Company. 

The discovery of a new "Mona 
Lisa" fails any longer to be 
surprising, since it has hap- 
pened so often. This time it occurs at Isle-

introduced as " the Isleworth Mona 'Lisa." Its 
owner, Mr. John R. Eyre, writes an inter- 
esting monograph on the subject, to prove 
that Leonardo da Vinci painted two portraits 
of the wife of Francisco del Giocondo, that 
neither is a copy of the other, and that both 
are still in existence, the newly discovered 
portrait being on the whole a better picture

than the familiar one in the Louvre. To ex- 
plain its long obscurity, a history of the can- 
vas is given. The evidence of its genuineness 
is based on quotations from contemporaneous 
documents, as follows: Two letters written 
in 1501 ; a memory sketch made by Raphael 
before 1505, which resembles the Isleworth 
portrait much more closely than the portrait 
in the Louvre ; the drafts of two letters writ- 
ten by Leonardo himself in 1511 ; and a con- 
versation between Leonardo and the Cardinal 
of Aragon in 1517, as reported by the Car- 
dinal's Secretary. By means of full-page pho- 
tographs, placed side by side in the book, 
one may notice differences in the pose of the 
head and in several minor details; also one 
sees that the background of the new picture 
remains unfinished, but is enclosed by two 
columns, and the size is somewhat larger. In 
the way of connoisseurship, only a little 
testimony is offered, but that little is quite 
emphatic. Mr. P. G. Konody is quoted as say- 
ing : " It [the newly discovered portrait] is 
of such superb quality that it more than holds 
its own when compared with the much- 
restored and repainted Louvre masterpiece 
. . . the features are more delicate, and let 
it be boldly stated, far more pleasing and 
beautiful than the Louvre version." It is 
interesting to learn that the Isleworth picture 
is at present in this country, at the Boston 
Museum of Fine Arts, where, in the words of 
the owner, it is " in safe keeping, beyond the 
reach of either cannon-belching culture, the 
false philosophy of force, or the cardinal vir- 
tue of aggression." (Scribner.) 



Fundamental, of Much instruction in little space 
English language is to be found in Dr. Frank H. 

and literature. y izete i ly s Essentials of En- 

glish Speech and Literature." The author is 
managing editor of the " Funk and Wagnalls 
New Standard Dictionary of the English Lan- 
guage," and it is not surprising to discover 
that his book incidentally impresses upon the 
reader the merits of that dictionary, and that 
it bears the Funk and Wagnalls imprint. 
After a short chapter on the origin of our 
language, its growth is traced from the Anglo- 
Saxon period to the time of Milton ; then fol- 
low chapters on some of the " mutations of 
form and sense" it has undergone, the alien 
elements it contains, the divisions into which 
literature falls, the function of the dictionary, 
the dictionary as a textbook, the function of 
grammar, the principles of phonetics and pro- 
nunciation, with remarks on reading, rules to 
be observed in writing for publication, indi- 
viduality in writing, and the corruption of 
speech. An alphabetical list of English and 



American writers is appended, and a twenty- 
page index closes the book. The outline 
sketch of English literature that fills about a 
third of the volume is compact and useful, 
though not exactly a marvel of scholarship. 
Of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, the author 
says that he "wrote the. first sonnets ever 
written in English," and he makes no men- 
tion of Wyatt, Surrey's senior by fourteen or 
fifteen years and acknowledged by him to be 
his master in poetry, and commonly credited 
with having taken the lead in importing the 
sonnet into our literature. It was a matter 
of course that Dr. Vizetelly should insist on 
the desirability of spelling-reform, but his 
pages do not shock a conservative reader by 
any radical departures from the accepted or- 
thography. His scholarly defence of the split 
infinitive is to be commended. In a treatise 
so largely devoted to inculcating and illus- 
trating correct usage in English, it is a little 
startling to find the author allowing himself 
such questionable constructions as " no less 
than thirty," " equally as appropriate," and 
" applied into." One who essays to teach 
clearness and conciseness as well as gram- 
matical correctness should not permit himself 
to- write such a sentence as this, descrip- 
tive of Sir Thomas More's best-known work: 
" The book is a keen satire of social and eco- 
nomic conditions that, judged by his other 
writings and his practise, show More's politi- 
cal philosophy was not that of Utopia." Of 
the same book we read on the same page that 
"the sanitation of cities is carefully pre- 
served." By precept, if not always by exam- 
ple, Dr. Vizetelly's manual will, it is to be 
hoped, promote the cause of good English, 
both in speech and in writing. 



The completion of the Panama 

Triumphs of ?. . , . , , , 

tropical Canal within the time allotted 

by the engineering experts is a 
triumph not only of industrial organization 
and engineering enterprise, but also of ap- 
plied biology in the field of sanitation. The 
extermination of yellow fever at Havana 
resulted from the discovery by Dr. Reed that 
a particular kind of female mosquito which 
had bitten a person in the earlier stages of 
yellow fever becomes after a lapse of twelve 
to eighteen days thereafter a source of yellow 
fever to non-immune persons who are bitten 
by this carrier of the incubated germs of this 
dread disease. Protection of yellow fever 
patients from mosquitoes, and mosquito ex- 
termination campaigns, have rid Havana, 
New Orleans, and Rio Janeiro of this great- 
est of tropical diseases, and have made pos- 
sible the completion of the Panama Canal

ahead of time, and with a death rate among 
employees less than that in industrial cities 
of temperate lands. The story of Dr. Reed's 
discovery and of its application to health con- 
trol in Cuba and Panama is told by the ex- 
pert who accomplished these remarkable feats 
in the face of doubt and opposition, and by 
the agency of slowly moving governmental 
agencies, in Dr. W. C. Gorgas's " Sanitation 
in Panama" (Appleton). The story is not 
without incidents both humorous and in- 
tensely dramatic. It forms one of the most 
remarkable documents in the history of scien- 
tific achievements, and is an incontrovertible 
argument for, and demonstration of, the true 
nature of at least two great diseases, yellow 
fever and malaria. It gives a logical basis 
for the only rational attitude of sensible men 
towards the ever-increasing social aspects of 
the prevention of disease by cooperative so- 
cial and governmental agencies. The book is 
interesting reading by reason of its simplicity, 
directness, humor, and the inclusion of a bit 
of the romantic history of Panama in days 
long before Gorgas and Goethals opened this 
highway to the world. The triumph at Pan- 
ama reveals new vistas of the possibilities of 
the conquest of the topics by civilization. 



A storehouse The fil * St Vt > lume f the 

of horticultural ten and enlarged edition of 
Professor Liberty H. Bailey's 
great horticultural reference work, " The 
Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture" (Mac- 
millan), was reviewed at length in the issue 
of this journal for August 16, 1914. Of Vol- 
umes II. and III., lately published, the gen- 
eral purpose and scope may be recorded with- 
out extended comment. The three volumes 
now completed, representing one-half of the 
whole work, comprise 1760 pages, with 2047 
illustrations. The second volume begins with 
Cabbage, and ends with Experiment Stations 
and Extension Teaching in Horticulture. 
The third volume begins with Faba (a genus 
of beans) , and ends with Kyllinga (a genus of 
sedges). Each important title is presented 
and signed by a recognized authority upon 
the subject. To select from the hundreds of 
titles a few for special mention is impossible, 
for the important ones are numerous. In the 
two volumes before us, such plant titles as 
Carnation, Chrysanthemum, Citrus, Corn, 
Dahlia, Ferns, Grape, occupy the most space. 
But even more important to many are such 
general titles as Color in Flowers, Diseases, 
Drainage, Exhibitions, Experiment Stations, 
Fertilizers, Floriculture, Flower, Forcing, 
Frost, Fruit-growing, Horticulture (includ- 
ing the literature of the subject), Irrigation, 



and Kitchen-garden. Under Island Depen- 
dencies, a full account is given of the plants 
under cultivation in Porto Rico, the Ha- 
waiian Islands, Guam, Tutuila, and the Phil- 
ippine Islands. The completed work will 
constitute a splendid storehouse of trust- 
worthy information for all who are interested 
in plants from any point of view. 

A study of * n "The Soliloquy in German 

the soliloquy in Drama" ( Columbia University 
"" Press) , Mr. Erwin Roessler has 
painstakingly traced the history of the solilo- 
quy from the mediaeval church plays to its 
abandonment in the realistic dramas of 
Hauptmann and his followers. Although the 
work shows much careful reading on the part 
of the author, it is unfortunately written after 
the conventional pattern of many disserta- 
tions. The striking number of ideas frankly 
taken over from other writers is often but a 
confession of the author's paucity of thought. 
Besides outlining the history of the soliloquy, 
Mr. Roessler states in his Introduction that 
" the investigation will attempt to throw light 
on the question whether the recent drama has, 
or has not, gained in artistic effectiveness by 
its gradual disuse of the soliloquy." In pre- 
senting his body of evidence, however, the au- 
thor seems to have lost sight of this purpose, 
which does not reappear until the conclusion. 
As a result, his contention that " the elimina- 
tion of the soliloquy of thought and feeling is 
a loss to the drama and that their restoration 
will increase its artistic effectiveness," comes 
as a surprise. On the basis of the examples 
adduced, the reader still feels at liberty to 
believe that the disuse of the soliloquy is not 
only an important step in the advancement 
of the drama, but also a boon to the more 
sophisticated audience of the present day. It 
is unfortunate that the author has not com- 
mand of an English style that would tend to 
make his discussion more readable. The an- 
cient use of the soliloquy does not exceed in 
frequency Mr. Roessler's use of the rhetorical 
question. In spite of these deficiencies, how- 
ever, the book may well be recommended to 
those in search of a summary of the subject. 

Since the first issue of his 
kero e :ndmX. "Nathan Hale, 1776," fourteen 

years ago, Professor Henry 
Phelps Johnston has had access to consid- 
erable new material in the shape of original 
manuscripts dating back to Hale's time and 
throwing fresh light on his heroic character 
and the fatal act of courage that has made 
him an object of increasing interest and ad- 
miration to posterity. The Hale correspon- 
dence and other papers now number nearly 



226 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16 



seventy separate pieces, of which sixty-four 
are printed, wholly or in part, in the new 
edition of Professor Johnston's book, which is 
published in handsome form by the Yale Uni- 
versity Press. These sixty-four pieces are, as 
he explains, mainly letters ; ten of them, with 
other papers, being from Hale's pen, the others 
from college classmates and later associates. 
Relegation of most of these documents to the 
appendix has made possible a more connected 
and smoothly flowing narrative in the body 
of the book. Accompanying the volume is a 
supplementary leaflet giving the lately dis- 
covered description of Hale by his fellow 
officer, Lieutenant Elisha Bostwick. Illustra- 
tions show the Hale homestead and monument 
at South Coventry, Connecticut, the hero- 
martyr's powder-horn and other personal be- 
longings, examples of his autograph and his 
father's, and the site of his execution. Bibli- 
ography and index round out this notable 
memorial to one whose last words will not 
soon cease to stir the soul, "I only regret 
that I have but one life to lose for my 
country." - 

BRIEFER MENTION. 

As the editors hint in their Preface to the 1915 
edition of "The Statesman's Year-Book" (Mac- 
millan), the difficulties confronted in the revision 
of the work for this present year of upheaval 
must have been rather staggering. Yet they have 
been bravely met, and the work seems to have 
suffered little in consequence. During the fifty- 
two years in which it has annually appeared, 
" The Statesman's Year-Book " has made a place 
for itself which no other reference book has been 
able to encroach upon, and to praise either its 
plan or its execution would now be almost an 
impertinence. 

Of the always valuable special numbers issued 
from time to time by " The International Studio " 
(John Lane Co.), the latest two are "The Year- 
Book of Decorative Art " for 1915, and a mono- 
graph on " Old English Mansions." The first 
named is devoted in largest part to a review of 
recent developments in English domestic architec- 
ture, particularly small country houses and cot- 
tages. But there are also chapters on "Architec- 
ture and Decoration in the United States," 
" Wall-paper Designers and their Work," and 
" British Decoration." As usual with the "Studio" 
publications, the illustrations (including several 
plates in colors) are profuse in number and irre- 
proachable in execution. The purpose of " Old 
English Mansions " is to present a collection of 
sixty excellent full-page reproductions of the 
architectural drawings of Joseph Nash, C. J. 
Richardson, J. D. Harding, Henry Shaw, and 
other early nineteenth century draughtsmen who 
have preserved for posterity a graphic record of 
many of England's storied homes. To the archi- 
tect, no less than to the lay reader of antiquarian 
bent, the volume should make a strong appeal. 



NOTES. 



A picture of England as presented in English 
literature has been completed by Mr. Edward 
Thomas, and is soon to be published under the 
title, "A Literary Pilgrim in England." 

Seven of Strindberg's shorter prose tales have 
been collected into a volume soon to be published 
by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. under the title, 
" The German Lieutenant, and Other Stories." 

Professor Joseph Jastrow's work on " Character 
and Temperament," which was first announced for 
publication several months ago, is soon to appear 
in Messrs. Appleton's " Conduct of the Mind 
Series." 

A forthcoming addition, the first that has been 
made for a long time, to Messrs. Appleton's 
" Literatures of the World " series, is "A History 
of Latin Literature," by Professor Marcus Dims- 
dale, of the University of Cambridge. 

The late Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith's last novel, 
" Felix O'Day," of which he had completed the 
final revision of proofs just before his death, will 
Jbe published by Messrs. Scribners on the 18th 
inst. The scenes are laid in New York City. 

The "Memories and Anecdotes" of Miss Kate 
Sanborn, which Messrs. Putnam will publish dur- 
ing the autumn, will contain personal reminiscences 
of a host of American celebrities, from Emerson to 
Mark Twain, and is likely to prove delightful 
reading. 

The fourth volume of " Glimpses of the Cos- 
mos: A Mental Autobiography," by Lester F. 
Ward, is announced by Messrs. Putnam. It deals 
with the period 1885-1893, between the forty- 
fourth and fifty-second years of the distinguished 
author's life. 

Two interesting interpretations of great writers, 
evidently the first volumes in a projected series, 
are announced by the Bobbs-Merrill Co. in Pro- 
fessor William Lyon Phelps's " Browning : How 
to Know Him," and Professor Bliss Perry's 
" Carlyle : How to Know Him." 

In her volume on " Six French Poets," which 
the Macmillan Co. is soon to publish, Miss Amy 
Lowell will present a series of biographical and 
critical essays dealing with Emile Verhaeren, Al- 
bert Samain, Remy de Gourmont, Henri de Reg- 
nier, Francis Jammes, and Paul Fort. 

Two interesting contributions to the literature of 
the stage are announced by Messrs. Lippincott in 
Mr. Maurice Sand's " The History of the Harle- 
quinade " and Mr. Mark E. Perugini's " The Art 
of the Ballet." The first-named work will contain 
a number of hand-colored illustrations. 

A single-volume edition of Mr. Graham Bal- 
four's " Life of Robert Louis Stevenson," in 
condensed form but containing some new and inter- 
esting matter, is in press with Messrs. Scribner. 
A series of topographical illustrations by Mr. 
Kerr Eby will be a special feature of the volume. 

We are glad to note the forthcoming publication 
by Mr. Thomas B. Mosher of three volumes inaugu- 
rating a series of " Lyra Americana." The initial

titles comprise " The Rose-Jar," by Mr. Thomas S. 
Jones, Jr.; "A Handful of Lavender," by Lizette 
Woodworth Reese ; and " The Rose from the 
Ashes," by Miss Edith M. Thomas. The quality of 
these three writers is a hopeful augury of the 
standards evidently to be maintained by the series. 

Mr. Burton E. Stevenson has compiled and Mr. 
Willy Pogany has illustrated " The Home Book of 
Verse for Young People," which endeavors to do 
for children the same service that Mr. Stevenson 
did for adult readers in " The Home Book of 
Verse." It will be published this month by Messrs. 
Holt. 

An addition to Napoleonic literature in the shape 
of a volume of " Letters of Captain Engelbert 
Lutyens, Orderly Officer at Longwood, St. Helena, 
February, 1820 November, 1823," edited from 
the originals in the British Museum by Sir Lees 
Knowles, is one of the forthcoming publications of 
the John Lane Co. 

A collected edition of the poems of Rupert 
Brooke, the gifted young Englishman who recently 
died from sunstroke while serving in the Dar- 
danelles campaign, will be brought out this month 
by the John Lane Co. The volume will contain a 
biographical introduction by Miss Margaret Hav- 
ington, and a photogravure portrait. 

" The Popular Science Monthly " has been 
bought by the Modern Publishing Company of 
New York City, and consolidated with " The 
World's Advance," formerly " Popular Elec- 
tricity." The two magazines will be merged under 
the title of "The Popular Science Monthly," 
beginning with the November issue. Mr. Walde- 
mar Kaempffert, for a long time editor of the 
monthly, will continue in that position. 

Three critical studies of the work of famous 
authors will be published at once by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. Mr. P. P. Howe discusses Mr. Ber- 
nard Shaw's personality as well as the various 
phases of his work; Miss Una Taylor offers a 
criticism of M. Maeterlinck as poet, playwright, 
and philosopher; Mr. Forrest Reid, in his volume 
on Mr. W. B. Yeats, includes a biography, al- 
though he is more concerned with Mr. Yeats as a 
writer than as a man. 

The first edition in English of the great Russian 
epic, " The Armament of Igor," is about to be 
published by the Oxford University Press. The 
editor is Mr. L. A. Magnus, LL.D., who has writ- 
ten a general introduction and gives a revised text, 
with translation, full notes, genealogical tables, etc. 
The poem, which describes a disastrous foray by 
Igor Svyatoslavic in 1185, forms part of the ordi- 
nary school course in Russia, and outside Russia is 
set for university courses in Slavonic; and the 
English edition is intended for both the student 
and the general reader. 

The current quarterly "News Notes of Califor- 
nia Libraries," a pamphlet of three hundred 
double-column pages, devotes thirty-nine of those 
pages to an annotated list of material in the State 
Library on the subject of California Indians. It 
also contains a review of recent California legisla- 



tion, notably library and school legislation, and the 
usual brief reports from all public libraries in the 
State, a "Directory for Library Supplies and 
Other Items of General Interest," and reports from 
the California Library Association, the Board of 
Library Examiners, and the State Library, with 
classified list of recent accessions to the latter. 

For some years past, the late Professor Thomas 
R. Lounsbury had been engaged upon a literary 
biography of Tennyson. It was not his purpose 
to cover the entire life of the poet, but only the 
most interesting part of it, ending with the pub- 
lication of the " Idylls of the King." At the time 
of his death, Professor Lounsbury had reached the 
annus mirabilis, when " In Memoriam " appeared 
and Tennyson was appointed Poet Laureate. 
These chapters, some of which were left incom- 
plete, have been prepared for the press by Pro- 
fessor Cross, and will be published in the autumn. 

A collected edition in two volumes of " The 
Political Writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau," ed- 
ited from the original manuscript and authentic 
editions, with introduction and notes, by Profes- 
sor C. E. Vaughan, is in preparation at the Cam- 
bridge University Press. The editor's aim has 
been to collect all the political writings of Rous- 
seau in one body and present them for the first 
time in the text which Rousseau actually wrote, 
as well as to define his place in the history of 
political thought. At present the printed material 
is scattered over numerous volumes, various pieces 
which have come to light during the last sixty 
years having not yet been included in the collected 
" Works." Some further " Fragments " are now 
added which have hitherto remained buried in the 
library of Neuchatel. These include several slight 
autobiographical pieces which throw a certain 
amount of light on the frame of mind in which 
the " Confessions " were written. The treatise on 
Corsica has hitherto been known only in a faulty 
text. 

The committee in charge of the Dramatic Mu- 
seum of Columbia University is issuing in limited 
editions several series of documents dealing with 
the theory and the practice of the art of the 
theatre, reprints of inaccessible essays and ad- 
dresses, translations from foreign tongues, and 
original papers. These documents are furnished 
with introductions, and they are annotated ade- 
quately, but succinctly. The second series (to be 
ready for distribution in October), will consist of 
the following four papers on acting : " The 
Illusion of the First Time in Acting," by Mr. 
William Gillette, with an introduction by Mr. 
George Arliss; "Art and the Actor," by Constant 
Coquelin; translated by Abby Langdon Alger, 
with an introduction by Mr. Henry James ; " Mrs. 
Siddons as Lady Macbeth and Queen Katherine," 
by Mr. H. C. Fleeming Jenkin, with an introduc- 
tion by Professor Brander Matthews ; " Reflex- 
ions on Acting," by Talma, with an introduction 
by Sir Henry Irving and a review by Mr. H. C. 
Fleeming Jenkin. Like the previous set of four 
volumes on play-making, this new series will be 
issued in an edition limited to 300 copies available 
to the public.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS. 



The classified list of books announced for 
autumn and winter publication, herewith pre- 
sented in accordance with a long-time annual 
custom of this journal, is as nearly complete 
as the exigencies of the publishing business 
and the necessary cooperation of the pub- 
lishers in supplying the needed data have 
permitted us to make it. As usual, consid- 
erations of space have made necessary the 
carrying over to our next issue of the two 
departments, " School and College Text- 
Books " and " Books for the Young." Inclu- 
sive of these categories, the list comprises this 
year approximately sixteen hundred titles, 
representing the output of some sixty pub- 
lishers, surely a surprisingly good showing 
in view of the abnormal conditions brought 
about by the war. In the leading editorial 
in this issue of THE DIAL, some of the more 
notable and interesting features of the present 
announcement list are commented upon.

A Protest Against the New Tyranny 

WHICH IS NOT THE NEARLY OBSOLETE DESPOTISM OF 
ONE MAN OVER THE PEOPLE BUT THE NEWER DESPOTISM 

of Overzealous and Indiscriminate Popular Legislation 

OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN 

The dangers to America from this new tyranny have been ably pointed out in the August 
FORUM by Mr. Truxtun Beale, the eminent publicist and donor to education. In his con- 
tribution he shows how applicable to our present-day conditions are the remarkable essays by 
Herbert Spencer published in England fifty years ago under the title THE MAN vs. THE 
STATE. Through Mr. Beale's co-operation THE FORUM will republish all of these essays 
serially, each chapter to be accompanied by expository articles on its present-day significance, 
these articles being specially written by the most eminent American authorities. Beginning in 
the September FORUM with Senator Root's article, the chapters with their expository con- 
tributors are as follows: 



The New Toryism

The Great Political Superstition

ism and the Free Theatre; The Battle with Illusions; The New Technic; The Play and the Reader, etc.

New York Tribune: 

"Not only the first book in its field; in the completeness of its scope, the scholarly, well-balanced thor- 
oughness of the treatment of its material, it is likely to remain the standard work as well for some time 
to come. One of the small number of books en the modern drama which the serious student cannot 
afford to leave unread." 

Professor Frank W. Chandler, University of Cincinnati: 

"Altogether the best treatment of the contemporary drama extant." 

E. E. HALE in THE DIAL: 

"One of the most widely read dramatic critics of our day; few know as well as he what is 'up' in the 
dramatic world, what are the currents of present-day thought, what people are thinking, dreaming, 
doing, or trying to do." 

Hartford Couranl: 

"A delightful exposition of the drama of the last fifty years." 

New York Times: 

"Apt, happily allusive, finely informed essays on the dramatists of our own time ... his essay

"Full of thoughtful and illuminating criticism on the drama as art, and deserves high praise." 

STARK YOUNG in The Drama: 

"The title expresses with unusual felicity its precise content and subject matter ... a most

Book News Monthly: 

"Shows clear understanding of the evolution of form and spirit, and the sound differentiation of the forces 
spiritual, intellectual and social which are making the theatre what it is to-day ... we can 
recollect no book of recent times which has such contemporaneousness, yet which regards the subject 
with such excellent perspective . . almost indispensable to the general student of drama 
a book of rich perspective and sound analysis. The style is simple and direct." 

Brooklyn Eagle: 

"Rapidly becoming one of the foremost critics of the drama, here or abroad." 

GEO. MIDDLETON in La Follette's: 

"The best attempt to formulate the tendencies which the drama is now taking in its evolutionary course. "

A Notable New Biography 

THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF 

JOHN HAY 

By WILLIAM ROSCOE THAYER 
Author of "The Life and Times of Cavour." 

This authorized Life of one of our greatest diplomats and men of letters is probably 
the most important American biography of the decade. The first volume is largely 
devoted to his life as private secretary and chief confidant of Lincoln, and gives a fresh 
and remarkably interesting picture of the great President and of the Civil War. The 
second volume deals principally with Hay's diplomatic career and throws a flood of new 
light on our foreign relations and on the character and conduct of his famous contempo- 
raries. 

Hay was a copious and picturesque letter-writer, and the wealth of material at 
Mr. Thayer's command has enabled him to tell the story of his subject's life, both as a 
man of letters and as a statesman, with unusual vividness and richness of detail. 
Illustrated. 2 volumes, $5.00 net. Ready October 16.

A Protest Against the New Tyranny 

WHICH IS NOT THE NEARLY OBSOLETE DESPOTISM OF 
ONE MAN OVER THE PEOPLE BUT THE NEWER DESPOTISM 

of Overzealous and Indiscriminate Popular Legislation 

OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN 

The dangers to America from this new tyranny have been ably pointed out in the August 
FORUM by Mr. Truxtun Beale, the eminent publicist and donor to education. In this con- 
tribution he shows how applicable to our present-day conditions are the remarkable essays by 
Herbert Spencer published in England fifty years ago under the title THE MAN vs. THE 
STATE. THE FORUM will republish eight of these essays serially, each chapter to be 
accompanied by expository articles on its present-day significance, these articles being specially 
written by the most eminent American authorities. Beginning in the September FORUM 
with Senator Root's article, the chapters with their expository contributors are as follows:

THE GREAT VOCATION. 



Insistence on the practical in education is 
one of the no new things under the sun. 
"When went there by an age, since the great flood," 
without its wiseacres of the cross-roads and the 
market unable to see the good in this or that 
study, without its self-made men to.point with 
pride to their own manufacture as a satisfac- 
tory proof that book-learning was futile, with- 
out its half-educated prophets to encourage the 
unenlightened discontent of pupil and parent ? 

Fortunately for both the intellectual and 
practical affairs of the world, however, educa- 
tional matters have never been for any length 
of time wholly in the control of either the 
wiseacres or the self-made man or the educa- 
tional demagogue. At really crucial moments, 
these personages have usually been inspired 
with the good sense, if not to leave educational 
policy to intellectual experts, at least them- 
selves to act under expert guidance. Society 
on the whole has submitted itself, in intellec- 
tual matters, to intellectual leadership. 

With the advance of democracy, there has 
been in this respect a tendency to change. The 
emphasis upon the people's right to be edu- 
cated, and upon government's duty and privi- 
lege to educate them, has had effects both bad 
and good. Among the good, especially in the 
United States, have been the dissemination of 
educational opportunity and the elevation of 
the popular level of intelligence. Among the 
bad has been the tendency toward popular 
control of educational ideals and educational 
policy. Government has been of the people, 
by the people, and for the people ; and educa- 
tion, too, the gift and the instrument of gov- 
ernment, has tended to be of the people, by the 
people, and for the people. The dissemina- 
tion of popular educational opportunity and 
the elevation of the level of popular intelli- 
gence have been accompanied by a restriction 
of expert opportunity and a lowering of the 
level of expert intelligence. Great numbers of 
the people are ambitious to acquire the knowl- 
edge so easily accessible, but only because 
knowledge is a useful instrument in practical 
affairs. Comparatively .few conceive of it as a 
source of growth into full stature rather than 



254 



THE DIAL 



[ Sept. 30 



an instrument. Fewer still are born again, 
into the Kingdom of the Intellectual, to realize 
the significance of the higher life of the mind 
both to the individual and to society. The 
majority principle is prevailing in educational 
sentiment as well as at the polls, and the great 
numbers are having their way. 

Among the manifestations of this popular 
control of ideals and policy, none is more 
noticeable than the recent and growing de- 
mand for vocational training. This, too, is no 
new thing under the sun. There has always 
been a demand for vocational training a just 
and necessary demand; and the demand has 
usually met with some manner of response. 
Expert professional men and craftsmen pro- 
mote the general welfare, and it is the interest 
as well as the duty of society to encourage 
expertness in some substantial way. In major 
degree, the response is to be seen in the elabo- 
rate European systems of technical schools. 
In minor degree, it is to be seen in the 
much less extensive and effective provision of 
America. 

There is, nevertheless, something new in 
regard to vocational training. It is to be 
observed especially in the United States. This 
new thing is, not the establishment of voca- 
tional courses or schools, but the establishment 
of them at the expense of the general intellec- 
tual ideal. If the European countries are 
allowing the " vocationalizing " of gymnasium, 
lycee, or college, it is at most in very slight 
degree. Europe has met the demand for tech- 
nical instruction by reaching down into its 
pocket and equipping real technical schools, 
separate and efficient, preserving intact the 
institutions that have so long stood for the 
higher intellectual life. The United States, 
realizing the need, but lacking the Old "World's 
courage and enlightenment, is robbing her 
high schools and colleges to satisfy the popular 
demand for the vocational, with the result that 
not only is vocational training provided only 
in form, but that higher education is preserved 
only in form. The college of liberal arts in the 
university is already in great part profession- 
alized, and the high school is fast becoming 
vocationalized, in spirit if not in actual fact. 
Liberal education in the college, except as it is 
accidental to professional preparation, is 
threatened with extinction ; and liberal educa- 
tion in the State institutions in general, both 
secondary and higher, is in so serious a condi- 
tion of discouragement that its friends are 



already looking for salvation to the rise of 
institutions unprejudiced by popular control. 

To be more concrete : we have heard a great 
deal of late about the high school as the 
" people's college," and of its duty to prepare 
the people's sons and daughters for "life." 
Those who are of this mind are thinking of 
" life " in vocational terms, as the earning of a 
livelihood in some trade, business, or profes- 
sion. If a girl wishes to be a stenographer or 
bookkeeper, if a boy intends to follow a clerical 
or mechanical calling, the public school, ac- 
cording to the vocational enthusiast, should 
prepare them to make an easy and more or less 
direct transition from the school room to their 
chosen occupations. Literature, music, lan- 
guage, algebra, history, and all studies and 
parts of studies which do not contribute di- 
rectly and immediately to this purpose, are not 
" vital," and are to be regarded as mere accom- 
plishments, if not as a pure waste of the pupil's 
time and the people's money. 

This is easy logic, as is all logic based on 
imperfect understanding. The friends of lib- 
eral education, or general culture, or pure 
learning, or whatever we choose to call the 
education that is accused of not preparing for 
" life," are able to see the vocational argument, 
but their vision does not find there the limit of 
its range. 

In the first place, vocational training worthy 
of the name in the high school is practically 
impossible. Actual count would demonstrate 
that the number of vocational subjects in 
which courses could be devised is so great that 
provision for school instruction in even a frac- 
tion of them would require an outlay in build- 
ings, apparatus, and teachers far greater than 
that more or less grudgingly furnished for 
the present comparatively simple programme. 

Further, with the most generous provision, 
some vocations considered important by many 
a pupil and parent would still remain unrepre- 
sented. Why the privilege of free instruction 
in carpentering and accounting, and not in 
barbering and shoemaking, plumbing and 
manicuring? Logically and practically, com- 
plete satisfaction would be impossible. 

Until, therefore, the State shall have secured 
the moral and financial support necessary to 
the institution of large numbers of technical 
courses and schools, it will have to limit its 
instruction to such vocations as come the near- 
est to being common to all the pupils and to 
the State itself.

Of the absolutely universal vocation, there 
is one example, and only one. This is the 

GREAT VOCATION the Vocation Of ENLIGHT- 
ENED CITIZENSHIP. 

The phrase may not be in common use, and 
the idea may not be clearly formulated in the 
citizen mind, but the educational policy of 
the State has nevertheless always been based 
on the principle. Nine-tenths of what is 
taught in both grades and high school is not 
really necessary to the earning of a livelihood. 
The great mass of instruction in the college of 
liberal arts has always been of the same sort. 
When the State has felt itself able, it has estab- 
lished technical and professional schools for 
training in such vocations as it regarded most 
important to itself the highly specialized 
instruments of the general welfare : law, medi- 
cine, teaching, agriculture, engineering. Yet 
it has never until recently substituted the 
narrowly vocational for the broad and funda- 
mental. It has only added it. It has recog- 
nized that the non-vocational is the great 
foundation that the best lawyers, the best 
physicians, the best teachers, the best agricul- 
turists, the best engineers, are those whose first 
vocation is enlightened citizenship. It would 
have done the same by religion, but for the 
conviction that other means were better. 

The training that leads to enlightened citi- 
zenship is not vocational in the narrow sense. 
What the vocational enthusiast is mainly and 
frankly thinking of, the preparation of the 
pupil for the earning of a living, is more or 
less narrow, selfish, and uncivic. It is in spirit 
an insistence upon the rights of the individual 
at the expense of the State. The training for 
the vocation of enlightened citizenship, on the 
contrary, is in spirit an insistence on the 
rights of the State. Under ideal conditions, 
too, the pleasure of the individual, despite the 
time cost of liberal education, coincides with 
the pleasure of the State ; though under actual 
conditions no small number of pupils, anxious 
for quick and showy returns and a speedy 
entrance upon "life," regard themselves as 
victims to a perverse educational requirement 
if they are compelled to study anything which 
in their judgment is not "vital." 

The immediate design of liberal education is 
not skill of hand or knowledge of technical 
detail, but the cultivation of mental power, the 
broadening of vision, the deepening of per- 
ception, the refinement of intellectual and 
spiritual temper. Its ultimate end is the pro- 



duction of the ideal citizen and of the ideal 
State. 

Compared with the vocation of enlightened 
citizenship, all other vocations are special. 
They are not separate from it, however. Un- 
less founded upon it, they are comparatively 
unprofitable, whether to the individual or the 
community, and may indeed easily become a 
source of harm. Enlightened citizenship is 
the broad and firm foundation, the special 
vocation is the superstructure. Narrow and 
infirm foundations will not support strong 
and useful buildings. We have too many type- 
writers and printers and proof-readers who 
cannot be trusted with spelling, punctuation, 
and composition, to say nothing of other mat- 
ters involving ordinary intellectual expert- 
ness. We have too many reporters, editors, 
magazine contributors, and authors of books, 
who write ignorant and slipshod English, and 
think as loosely and unprofitably as they write. 
The press goes a long way toward undoing the 
work of the school. We have too many teach- 
ers of thin and narrow quality; too many 
preachers whose intellectual deficiencies are 
such as to neutralize the effect of earnest and 
self-sacrificing character; too many lawyers 
who took the short cut to a professional career, 
and are uncultivated and slovenly in thought, 
speech, and intellectual habit ; too many phy- 
sicians whose growth is stunted because their 
intellectual roots were not set deep enough. 
In all these and other professions, the fulness 
of power that marks the master-personality 
has not been attainable because of deficiency 
in general cultivation. The immediate object 
of the individual has been realized, but at the 
expense of the potential total ; the good enough 
has been the enemy of the best. 

The same is true of less professional walks 
of life. There are too many culture club peo- 
ple and platform lecturers with superficial and 
catchy accomplishments instead of real depth ; 
too many playwrights, actors, managers, and 
theatre-goers who are not only untouched by 
the great dramatic ideals of past and present, 
but are barbarians, and worse than barbarians, 
in taste. There are too many of the rich who 
neither possess nor know the value 'of intel- 
lectual and spiritual wealth, and are unable 
even to recognize it when it is placed before 
them. There are too many of the leisured who 
are unacquainted with the most gratifying and 
profitable means of pleasure, as well as the 
most inoffensive and noble. We have too many

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 30 



voters who know only how to mark a ballot, 
who cannot estimate the worth of men and 
measures, who cannot think without the giant 
head-line and the screaming editorial. We 
have too many social and political reformers 
whose chief qualification is a "heart in the 
right place," who read loosely, think loosely, 
write loosely, and legislate as if the making 
of law were an invention of the day before 
yesterday. 

In every one of these cases, and in all other 
cases where, through ignorance, haste, or false 
ideas of economy, the vocation of enlightened 
citizenship has been left out of account, the 
individual suffers much, but the State suffers 
more. Whether the citizen does the best of 
which he is capable, or the second best, is a 
matter of concern not only to himself, but to 
the community and the nation. Whether from 
the individual point of view or the social, 
enlightened citizenship is the first and the 
greatest vocation. 

The vocation of enlightened citizenship does 
not look to the holding of a position as the 
prime object; it looks rather to excellence in 
the holding of it. The ideal of the great voca- 
tion is not immediate success in the earning of 
a living, but the capacity to earn it with the 
greatest intelligence and the greatest measure 
of success. It looks forward to the profes- 
sional man or the mechanic developed to the 
full capacity of his powers. Its aim is not the 
exploitation .of talent, but the development of 
personal excellence and total usefulness. It 
looks ahead, not four years, but forty years. 
It looks to a substantial and enduring edifice, 
not a temporary and make-shift shelter. It 
does not ask, " How much are you going to 
earn ? " or even " How much are you going to 
know ? " but "Are you going to make of your- 
self all that is possible ? " and "Are you go- 
ing to be a leader?" Its ambition is not the 
production of the average, but of leadership. 

Progress is only secondarily a matter of the 
crowd. The religious or civic ideals of an age 
or a community are not determined by the 
common man. It is the exceptional man, the 
reformer, the enthusiast, the personality in 
which the age or the community, so to speak, 
flowers out, that determines the ideal. The 
supreme concern of the army is its general, of 
the church its prophet, of the world of knowl- 
edge the scholar, of mechanics the inventor. 
Progress is a matter of dynamics. Without 
leadership without men who think enough 



more, feel enough more, see enough farther 
than the ordinary to give them authority 
there are no dynamics, and there will be no 
progress. 

Vocational training in the ordinary sense is, 
within limits, desirable and necessary ; but its 
place is in the technical school, not in the 
school of liberal arts. The high school is the 
people's college, but not the people's business 
college. If it is a business college at all, it is 
the business college of the State at large, not 
that of the comparatively few sons and daugh- 
ters of the people whose first ambition is a 
livelihood. The prime business of State educa- 
tion is a universal business, and Big Business 
is the business of enlightened citizenship. 
Every displacement of a liberal study by a 
vocational study is prejudicial to the ideal 
interests of the commonwealth. Livelihoods 
can be trusted to take care of themselves, if 
we must choose; but enlightened citizenship 
cannot. GRANT SHOWERMAN. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE SIMULTANEOUS NUTRITION OF MIND AND 

BODY is something that is both possible and in 
no wise undesirable. Solitary feasting for 
feasting's sake has ever been held in abhor- 
rence except by gluttons ; and even the silent 
and solemn intake of nutriment at the family 
table, three times a day, is not exactly an 
inspiring spectacle. Hence the cultivation of 
table-talk and the less usual but almost 
equally pleasant practice of having someone 
read aloud while the rest eat and listen an 
agreeable monastic custom, except that in 
monasteries the reading usually lacks liveli- 
ness and variety. Table-rea'ding, as an aid 
and incentive to table-talk, is surely an excel- 
lent thing. Dr. Bostwick, in his admirable 
book on "The Making of an American's 
Library," noticed in detail on another page, 
reprehends the union of eating and reading. 
He says : " I have seen men reading books at 
lunch when they were actually masticating 
their food. I am sure they both read and ate 
badly." Not necessarily. If only for hygienic 
reasons, it is well for the eater not to occupy 
his mind with the act of eating, an act that 
needs scarcely more conscious attention than 
does breathing or walking. Why all this sol- 
emn formality of successive courses with their 
corresponding array of table implements? 
A novel and an apple in a hammock, or a 
book of verses underneath the bough, with 
loaf of bread ancl jug of wine (or water)

some such combination approaches the ideal. 
Shelley used to read voraciously while he 
munched his daily bread in his study at Ox- 
ford, leaving a circle of crumbs around his 
chair. He was also famous for his simulta- 
neous walking and reading (a practice sanc- 
tioned by Dr. Bostwick) , and for his walking 
and eating, often darting into a bakeshop to 
renew his supply of bread in the course of 
his walk ; and if, as is likely enough, he some- 
times combined the three exercises, he thereby 
got thrice as much out of a given portion of 
time as most of his fellows. Why should the 
renewal of the bodily tissues be made the 
occasion of a periodic solemnity of which one 
must stand in some awe? Nature knows no 
such stupid artificialities. Shelley munching 
his bread while he talks with Hogg or reads 
to himself, and FitzGerald nibbling his apple 
while he paces the room and entertains with 
high discourse his guests at the table, please 
us more than does the scrupulous observer of 
the tiresome formalities of the banquet-board. 
If reading is not to be allowed with eating, 
why should not talking also be forbidden? 
Articulation and mastication go not well 
together, but silent reading is no hindrance to 
deglutition. And so we cannot side with this 
condemnation of simultaneous eating and 
reading, except where such a practice would 
be impolite. 

FRENCH LITERARY GENIUS AS FOOD FOR CAN- 
NON forms the subject of more than one 
lament from the land of Racine and Moliere. 
M. Paul Chavannes in a letter to " The New 
Statesman " runs over the names and achieve- 
ments of a goodly company of romancers and 
poets who within the last twelvemonth have 
given their lives for their country. He enu- 
merates, for example, Charles Peguy, Louis 
Pergaud, Ernest Psichari, Alain-Fournier, 
Pierre Gilbert, Leon Bonneff, Francois Lau- 
rentie. Robert d'Humieres, Art Roe, Emile 
Despax, du Fresnois, "and many others" 
names less familiar to us than to the French 
reading public, but each standing for good 
and promising work cut short in the morning 
of the worker's life. Of the heroic fate of 
Psichari, for instance, author of the stirring 
"Appel des Armes," we read : " He died 
nobly the death he asked for, at Virton, in 
Belgium, at the beginning of the great re- 
treat. His battery had been ordered to keep 
the enemy in check whilst the army was fall- 
ing back. They were expected to hold their 
ground for a few hours, and they did so for a 
whole day ; and when the last shell had been 
spent officer and gunners were killed on the 
guns they had rendered unusable." Another 



passage tells us that " the ' Revue Critique des 
Livres et des Idees,' which has of late years 
been one of the strongest of the influences 
which have shaped the intellectual youth, had 
on the outbreak of war thirty members of 
its editorial staff called to the colors; of 
these, according to the ' Humanite,' eleven 
have been killed and eight wounded, whilst 
two are missing in all, twenty-one out of 
thirty and this was before the last fights in 
Artois and the Argonne ! " Rather expensive 
Kanonen futter, in very truth ! 



UNPOPULAR PERIODICALS, those that make 
necessarily a restricted appeal and are forced 
to content themselves w r ith the consciousness 
of good work done in a worthy cause, are 
more numerous than is commonly suspected. 
There must be in this country alone several 
hundreds of struggling periodical publica- 
tions, including the proceedings and trans- 
actions of learned societies and the journals 
issued in behalf of various worthy causes of 
a philanthropic or charitable nature, that 
never really make both ends meet, in a busi- 
ness sense, and can never hope to do so. Even 
such a widely and favorably known magazine 
as "The Popular Science Monthly," founded 
in 1872 by the Appleton publishing house and 
the Youmans brothers (Edward L. and "Will- 
iam J.), was losing ten thousand dollars a 
year when, in 1900, it was finally abandoned 
in despair by the Appletons and reorganized 
on a different basis by other managers. And 
now, after fifteen years of highly creditable 
activity under this management, but appar- 
ently with no corresponding pecuniary re- 
turns, there is to be a new shuffling of the 
cards. A bid for greater popularity is to be 
made in the form of an illustrated magazine 
less adapted to the tastes of readers of educa- 
tion and a love for science than to the de- 
mands of a larger and necessarily a less 
highly educated public. In the words of Dr. 
Cattell, present editor of the publication that 
has helped so notably to keep American read- 
ers informed with regard to the latest achieve- 
ments of science : "A group of men desiring 
a journal to which the name ' The Popular 
Science Monthly' will exactly apply, this 
publication has been transferred to them, 
while, beginning in October, a journal on the 
present lines of 'The Popular Science Monthly' 
will be conducted under the more fitting name 
of ' The Scientific Monthly.' This differentia- 
tion of 'The Popular Science Monthly' into 
two journals is in the natural course of evolu- 
tion, each journal being able to adapt itself to 
its environment more advantageously than is 



258

possible for a single journal. Each can per- 
form an important service for the diffusion 
and advancement of science." Notable is Dr. 
CattelPs inclination to regard with disfavor 
any permanent endowment of the class of 
publications here considered ; rather would he 
look for their support to increased subscrip- 
tions from public libraries and from indi- 
viduals in sympathy with the purposes of 

these publications. 



SOUTH AFRICA'S FAVORITE AUTHOR, though 
geographically separated from us by a third 
of the earth's circumference, is very near us 
in the things that know naught of space or 
time. According to a writer in the London 
" Outlook," Mr. Horace Rose is enjoying a 
popularity that, measured by the sales of his 
latest book ("On the Edge of the East") in 
his native land, must be highly gratifying to 
him. Though a successful novelist, he has 
won fame chiefly by his humorously satirical 
works, such as "A Caper on the Continent" 
and the book named above. A passage of his 
describing his visit to the Coliseum (which 
he chooses to spell "Colosseum") is notable 
for a manifest resemblance in its style to that 
of an earlier humorist of the western world. 
After inspecting the Roman ruin aforemen- 
tioned the author returns to his hotel in a 
self-congratulatory frame of mind for living 
in the Christian era rather than in pagan 
times. But picking up a newspaper, he 
chances upon an account of a certain lynch- 
ing episode in one of our southern states, 
which moves him in a manner thus described : 
" When I had finished reading I went back to 
the Colosseum and apologized to Nero. I felt 
that I owed it to him. He had never had the 
benefits of a Christian teaching, of a class at 
Sunday-school, of an enlightened Press, of a 
world-wide civilization with its broad views 
and high traditions. But every man and 
woman in that twentieth-century crowd had 
had these blessings, and thus abused them. 
I would have been less ashamed to be seen 
walking down Broadway, New York, arm-in- 
arm with Nero, at the head of a procession 
of Christian corpses, than shaking hands with 
any of these people." Mr. Rose's fame seems 
in a fair way to spread beyond the bounds of 
his native South Africa. 



A NEW USE FOR THE CARD CATALOGUE, but a 

use to which it is unfortunate that it should 
have to be applied, is described by an Asso- 
ciated Press correspondent at Berlin. " The 
exact registration of the huge horde of over 
a million prisoners of war in Germany, so 
that rank, service division, and place of con- 



finement of each man can be instantly deter- 
mined, has been perfected to an astonishing 
degree by Count Schwerin, a sixty-year-old 
captain of cavalry. To-day the relatives of 
any French, Russian, English, Canadian, 
Italian, Servian, Montenegrin, Belgian, or 
Japanese prisoner in Germany can ascertain 
within twenty-four hours where that soldier 
is and what his condition is." The plan 
adopted is the one so familiar to library work- 
ers, and doubtless the only scheme at once 
practicable and economical. Eighty assis- 
tants are engaged in the maintenance of this 
immense card catalogue, and the superinten- 
dent of the system, Count Schwerin himself, 
who is referred to not quite accurately as its 
"inventor," gives twelve hours a day to his 
task. About eight hundred letters of inquiry 
come to his "Kartothek," or card-repository, 
every day, and it is his boast and pride to have 
them all answered within twenty-four or, at 
the utmost, forty-eight hours. As the letters 
are in many languages and of varying de- 
grees of illegibility, this promptitude is highly 
creditable. A smaller catalogue contains a 
list of the dead, so far as names and facts are 
ascertainable, which is not very far. And all 
this indexing activity, set in operation by a 
lamentable necessity, might in happier times 
have served to provide with card catalogues 
a score or more of public libraries in as many 
smiling villages of the fatherland. 



READING IN BED has charms that have been 
painted by many an able hand. Few have 
more keenly appreciated those charms than 
the writer of a recent letter to " The Southern 
Notes," the monthly publication of the Utica 
Normal and Industrial Institute, at Utica, 
Mississippi. The letter is addressed to the 
Principal, Mr. William H. Holtzclaw, by one 
of his pupils, Miss Ethel Sanders. "It is 
certainly a great pleasure to write to you," 
she says. " I am very glad to tell you that I 
am almost in good health. I must tell you 
how my aunt and the doctor treated me while 
I was sick. They did all they could to keep 
me from my books, but they did not succeed, 
and I kept them hid in the bed. They had 
friends to watch me, but I read them under 
cover. There was a hole in the quilt that gave 
me some light. So, although they watched me 
every day and night, I succeeded in reading 
a few lines in my books anyway, and I fretted 
for them all the time." Then she describes 
how she used violence on the children that 
came into her room and interrupted her read- 
ing. Was ever anyone so fired with the furor 
legendi in lecto, the reading-in-bed mania, as 
this colored girl of Mississippi ? Not inferior

to her in determination of a like sort was a 
certain pupil (now a writer of distinction) at 
the Perkins Institute for the Blind, nearly 
thirty years ago. Mr. Clarence Hawkes re- 
lates in his autobiography, which is more 
fully noticed on another page, that in the 
editorship and publication of the school 
paper, " The Echo," he found himself obliged 
to do much of the work at night in bed, where 
he deftly manipulated a small typewriter 
under the bedclothes. " Several times," he 
says, " Captain Wright, the vigilance man, 
came into my room and walked over to my 
bed, to discover where that strange clicking 
came from, but I was always sleeping soundly 
when he appeared and the typewriter was 
hidden beneath the bedclothes, so my secret 
was never discovered." Evidently there are 
possibilities in the way of literary activity 
even for the hours spent in bed. 


THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WHEREFORE OF THE 

WOMAN LIBRARIAN has apparently but just 
dawned upon the French mind. A distin- 
guished savant of France has set forth in the 
"Revue Internationale de 1'Enseignement " 
some of the qualifications, already well known 
to us in America, which the woman librarian 
possesses in a larger measure than the man. 
From extracts quoted by " The Library Jour- 
nal " a few passages may here be of interest. 
" Let us be frank," says the writer. " It is 
work which suits a woman much better than 
a man. In reality, men are not at home in 
the duties of the librarian. . . This subordi- 
nate role does not suit the natural pride of 
men. And one need not be much of a psy- 
chologist to divine the inevitable frictions that 
would culminate in grotesque disputes if the 
fear of ridicule did not forbid carrying things 
to the extreme. . . It is probable that with a 
feminine staff all this friction would disap- 
pear, because the psychological reasons al- 
ready indicated would not exist. Women 
would not feel humiliated by serving, by 
playing in the library the part they play in 
the home. Naturally more flexible, more 
teachable, more affable than men, they would 
accomplish with pleasure and smilingly, with- 
out tiring, the modest duties which do not 
belong to the other sex." All indisputably 
true so far as the daily service of the library- 
using public and the daily personal contact 
with that public are concerned. Hence the 
great preponderance of young women as 
library assistants over young men. But the 
burdens of large administrative responsibility 
are still thought to be better borne by men, 
and so our great public and university libra- 



ries are, as a rule, under male control. Can 
we imagine any woman as accomplishing what 
Dr. Billings accomplished in building up and 
directing the New York Public Library, or as 
carrying on the work of Librarian Putnam at 
Washington or Librarian Lane at Harvard? 


HERR LISSAUER'S LITERARY LAPSE, to style it 
by no harsher name, in giving to the world 
his hysterical "Hymn of Hate," has been 
apologized for by him in 1 fine and manly 
fashion. It was in reply to some adverse com- 
ment on the poem in the " Berliner Tage- 
blatt" that its author explained how the lines 
were "written as the result of a passionate 
impulse in the first weeks of the war, when 
the impression created by England's declara- 
tion of war was fresh." Moreover, he assures 
us, the hymn was not intended for the young, 
and he has always been opposed to its inclu- 
sion in schoolbooks. He continues: "The 
' Song of Hate ' is a political poem directed 
not against individual Englishmen, but 
against England as a political force, and 
collectively against the English will to destruc- 
tion which threatens Germany. In the excite- 
ment of those days my feelings were deeply 
stirred by this. Whether these feelings can 
continue with the cool consideration of prac- 
tical politics is another question." Excellent, 
every reader outside of Germany, if not also 
within that empire, must say. Whether now 
the august hand that decorated the poet's 
breast for those choleric verses will proceed 
to add another decoration for this handsome 
acknowledgment of a possible excess of acer- 
bity, remains to be seen ; but the probabilities 
are considerably more than a billion to one 
against any such imperial admission of error. 



THE AGONIES OF " MOVING DAY " IN A LARGE 

LIBRARY are seldom limited to twenty-four 
hours in time. The Harvard library began 
three months ago to take possession of the 
new and palatial Widener building, and the 
battalions of books have been on the march, 
in rather leisurely fashion, ever since. But a 
college or university library has the advan- 
tage of a long vacation for its change of quar- 
ters, when such change is necessary. More in 
the nature of a forced march is that which 
the books of a constantly busy public library 
must make in a similar case. Comparison has 
been made between the moving of Harvard's 
900,000 volumes and stacks of pamphlets and 
the transfer of the Boston Public Library's 
collection from Boylston Street to Copley 
Square twenty years ago the only library- 
moving in that part of the country compara-

ble in magnitude with the present operation 
at Cambridge. But the Boston task was prac- 
tically completed between Dec. 14, 1894, and 
Jan. 28, 1895 ; and there have been other big 
movings of this nature, notably the recent 
one at Springfield, Mass., that have made a 
far better record for celerity. Moving is, at 
best, a trying if not agonizing experience; 
but it is a part of the price that libraries and 
the rest of us have to pay for larger quarters 
and more stately .mansions. 



THE REAL THINGS OF LIFE are not exactly 
the same for any two persons. One may kin- 
dle with enthusiasm at the mention of Indian 
arrow-heads, or totem-poles, or cuneiform in- 
scriptions, or postage stamps; another may 
go into ecstasies over Turkish rugs, or Japan- 
ese fans; and a third will perhaps be stirred 
by martial exploits and tales of heroism. 
There recently died at Great Barrington a 
man whose grandfather was keeper of the 
White Horse Inn made famous by Blackmore 
in "Lorna Doone." and who himself was so 
fortunate as to be born in that celebrated 
hostelry, but who seems to have been fired 
with no zeal for first editions of the famous 
novelist's works, nor to have felt any especial 
love for those works or for the scenes they 
depicted. Richard H. Maunder (for that was 
his name) gave his affections to the products, 
not of the romancer's brain, but of the pot- 
ter's \vheel and the potter's shaping thumb, t 
In other words, it was the old china of Staf- ' 
fordshire that presented itself to him as the ! 
one object preeminently worth while, and of ' 
that china the dark and the blue varieties | 
were to him supremely desirable, so that he 
became one of the greatest living authorities 
in and collectors of that branch of antique 
pottery. It was an inherited taste, his grand- 
father, of the White Horse Inn, having been 
possessed with the same frenzy. The recent 
famous novels of the "Five Towns" series 
ought to have been the younger Mr. Maun- 
ders favorite reading ; but perhaps there was 
not enough of Staffordshire pottery even in 
them to satisfy the enthusiast. 



WARSAW'S LITERARY TREASURE, now in the 
conqueror's hands, will not, like the Louvain 
library, go up in smoke, though it may not 
remain intact in its present home. Warsaw- 
University has a library of six hundred thou- 
sand volumes, and a considerable collection of 
manuscripts and maps, the Krasinski Library 
numbers more than one hundred thousand 
volumes, the public library of the city one 
hundred and sixty thousand, and the Warsaw 



Polytechnic Institute has about thirty-five 
thousand volumes. Of these collections, that 
belonging to the university is by far the most 
valuable. It acquired from some of the mon- 
asteries suppressed in 1819 many rare works 
from the Aldine, Elzevir, Plantin, Stephanus, 
and other early presses of Europe. The Elze- 
virs alone, several hundred in number, form 
a collection that is considered one of the 
finest of its kind. It w r ill be a century ago 
next year that the University of Warsaw was 
founded. The loss of its library, if it is to 
lose it, or the best part of it, will be a sad 
centennial event for Warsaw, though for the 
rest of the world far less sad than a wanton 
destruction of so much irreplaceable literary 

treasure. 



THE FAVORITE READING OF CLERGYMEN is by 

no means always and invariably theology. It 
is an old story that when " Jane Eyre " came 
out, sixty-eight years ago. Dr. Mark Hopkins, 
President of Williams College and one of the 
most noted pulpit orators of his day, was 
repeatedly discovered by members of his fam- 
ily immersed in the enthralling novel when 
he was supposed to be writing sermons or 
reading the early Christian Fathers in his 
study. A half -embarrassed, half -petulant 
" Pshaw ! " and a hasty thrusting of the book 
aside would follow as soon as he found him- 
self caught in his unclerical occupation ; but 
repeated relapses ensued until the story was 
finished. It is reported by the General Theo- 
logical Library of Boston, which circulates no 
fiction but does provide reading matter of 
other kinds for the clergy of New England, 
that theological works are less in demand 
than biographies and books on sociology and, 
in general, " inspirational " literature. The 
stimulus of the story-book has to be sought 
elsewhere. The good work of this library, 
which has already been commended in these 
columns, is limited to no sect or creed. Any 
minister of the gospel in New England may 
draw upon its resources to the extent of two 
books a month, postage both ways being paid 
by the library; and this generous privilege 
is now enjoyed by more than eighteen hun- 
dred book-borrowers. 



LITERARY ARTISTS IN THE TRENCHES are 
placing the outside world in their debt for 
occasional vivid descriptions of soldier-life 
that get past the censor and inform those at 
home how things are going in some undesig- 
nated spot on the long battle-line. Many of 
these writers are amateurs, and their per- 
formance has a singular freshness and charm, 
while others are reporters by profession and

show themselves a little more conscious of 
their art. " The Institute Journal," of Lon- 
don, official periodical publication of the In- 
stitute of Journalists, has lately printed a list 
of nearly twelve hundred journalist soldiers 
who either now are serving their country at 
the front or have been doing so. Among the 
most distinguished of these war writers are 
Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, Mr. Stanley Wash- 
burn, Mr. Bernhard Paris, Mr. Philip Gibbs, 
and Mr. G. H. Perris. The raw material for 
campaign books and articles that is now being 
accumulated must exceed anything of the sort 
ever known in the history of this w T ar-scarred 
planet. 

INSTRUCTION IN LIBRARY ECONOMY IN HOL- 
LAND appears to be now recognized as a legiti- 
mate part of the university's teaching activi- 
ties. In " The Library Journal " for this 
month it is announced that both Amsterdam 
and Utrecht universities " have added to their 
faculties of literature a chair for library 
economy and bibliography. Dr. H. E. Greve 
of the Royal Library at The Hague has begun a 
series of lectures at the first-named university 
on the subject of national and international 
catalog rules. Dr. A. Hulsof has taken up 
the subject of general and historical bibli- 
ography for his lectures at the University of 
Utrecht." Many there are still living who 
can recall the derisive smile with which, as a 
rule, the university or college man under the 
old dispensation would refer to "library 
science " and those who professed to teach its 
mysteries. 

COMMUNICATIONS. 

A FRENCH TRANSLATION OF " THE EGOIST." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

While in Paris last summer I picked up a French 
translation of Meredith's masterpiece. The book 
interested me because it was the first work of one 
of my favorite English authors that I had seen in 
French. Also, to tell the truth, I disbursed more 
cheerfully the few francs necessary for its pur- 
chase (money was scarce in Paris just then) as I 
hoped that the proverbial clarity of French might 
help me over some knotty passages in the original. 
" What is not clear is not French," as we all know. 
Well then, " L'Egoiste, traduit de 1' Anglais par 
Maurice Strauss, Paris : Charles Carrington, 1904," 
is not French. Perhaps Meredith cannot be made 
French. It is, however, noteworthy that neither 
the name of the translator nor of the publisher is 
quite Gallic. We have, then, a difficult English 
author translated by a semi-Teuton and published 
by an Anglo-Saxon. We may admire their cour- 
age, if not the result. 

I may state at once that in reading the transla- 
tion I was constantly obliged to consult the original 



to get, at least approximately, the meaning. The 
Prelude is only a rough paraphrase of Meredith; 
parts of it, as indeed of the whole novel, are omit- 
ted, one might wish that more were; parts are 
more easily intelligible in the French; but all the 
sparkle has vanished. Assuming that the English 
is familiar to your readers, I will cite merely the 
opening paragraph of the translation : 

" Quand on joue la comedie, e'est dans un salon. 
Tout se passe entre civilises; a 1'abri des poussieres 
du dehors, des variations de 1' atmosphere ; en toute 
correction. Pour faire apparaitre le relief de 1'evi- 
dence, notre logique n'use point de ees loupes neces- 
saires au travail de 1'horloger. Le sens comique 
conc.oit une situation determinee pour quantite de 
types, et rejette tous lea accessoires qui pourraient 
faire longueur. La vision et 1'enthousiasme, c'est tout 
ce qu'il faut. Eegardez et ne vous occupez que de 
voir. Le reste viendra tout seul." 

In all this I am painfully reminded of a previous 
impression upon opening a French version of 
" Macbeth," in which the witches' greeting appeared 
as " Bon jour, Macbeth! " 

But the loss of sparkle is not all. That was 
to be expected, for it would probably require a 
life-time adequately to render Meredith into any 
foreign language. But there are curious neo- 
logisms, representing sporadic efforts at word-for- 
word translation. Thus in the first three pages, 
" digestibly " appears as digestivement ; " lumi- 
nous rings eruptive of the infinitesimal " becomes 
anneaux lumineux eruptes de I' Infinitesimal. Nei- 
ther digestivement nor erupter is cited by standard 
dictionaries; and besides, the second phrase misses 
the point. 

Perhaps worse, from an English point of view, 
are the gross mistranslations, which can only come 
from a failure to consult the dictionary. Thus, 
still in the first three pages, we find " branfulness " 
= sonorite; " malady of sameness " = maladie de 
I'ego'isme; " headlong trains " des longs trains. 
Other translations give the idea, perhaps, but the 
reason for not following the original faithfully is 
not apparent. For instance : " the land of fog- 
horns " from which we seek some escape, is ren- 
dered, pays brumeux des coquecigrues. Of " our 
o'er hoary ancestry them in the oriental pos- 
ture, to which our visit to science introduced us," it 
is written: "La science nous presenta a nos 
primitifs ancetres chenus ils nous rec.urent en 
posture orientale," when of course the meaning is : 
" ceux qui affectionnent la posture orientale." 

It would be as unprofitable as tiresome to push 
too far such an examination. But lest I be accused 
of taking examples only from the most difficult 
chapter of the book, I may cite at haphazard some 
curious misrenderings. Every page which I have 
compared with the original is bristling with blun- 
ders. On the first page of Chapter I v , Meredith 
says of Simon Patterne that he was marvellously 
endowed with the power of saying no. " He said 
it with the resonant emphasis of death to younger 
sons." This significant phrase is translated : " Et 
1'emphase de sa volonte glagait de terreur jusqu' 
a ses fils." In the next paragraph, speaking of 
Lieutenant Crossjay's act of valor which brought 
him to the notice of Patterne Hall, Meredith says:

THE DIAL 



[ Sept. 30 



" The officer's youth was assumed on the strength 
of his rank, perhaps likewise from the tale of his 
modesty." This subtle touch is thus smothered: 
" L'age tendre du heros fut mis en relief par sa 
bravoure, et sa modestie brocha sur le tout." 

At times the translator seems to have copied the 
first meaning found in his dictionary, leaving the 
sense to look out for itself. Sir Willoughby is 
relating to Clara the early career of Vernon Whit- 
ford (page 83 of Scribner's "Pocket Edition"). 
" ' Leaves the Hall ! ' exclaimed Willoughby. ' I 
have not heard a word of it. He made a bad start 
at the beginning . . . had to throw over his Fel- 
lowship." On page 133 of the translation, we find : 
" Quitter le chateau ! s'exclama Willoughby. C'est 
le premier mot que j'en entends. II fit un faux 
depart au debut . . . il eut d jeter par dessus sa 
camaraderie." 

One more example I cannot resist. Sir Wil- 
loughby, trying to persuade Vernon to remain at 
Patterne, says : " Take a run abroad, if you are 
restless." This becomes : " Si vous etes fatigue du 
repos, tirez une bordee." Possibly " a run abroad " 
signifies tirer une bordee to a certain class of 
wealthy young hot-bloods; but from Sir Wil- 
loughby Patterne of Patterne Hall to the dignified 
scholar, Vernon Whitf ord, this bit of sailor's slang 
is grotesque in the extreme. 

The effort to bring Meredith within the reach of 
French readers is certainly a creditable one; but 
it is a task to which angels, or those who speak 
with the tongue of angels, alone may aspire. Such 
a version as that perpetrated by the present trans- 
lator should not be allowed to pass unchallenged.

THE GERMAN WAR BOOK. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Owing to the hypnotic influence exerted upon 
Americans by the prospect of earning English 
gold, I have tried to reconcile myself to all the 
American misrepresentation and vilification of Ger- 
many and Germany's cause. But the review of 
Professor Morgan's translation of " The War Book 
of the German General Staff," in your issue of 
Sept. 2, is so vilely and so outrageously unfair, 
so thoroughly British in its viewpoint, that my 
gorge rises at it and I must protest. 

The writer of that review seeks to bring the 
German method of warfare into contempt by point- 
ing out that, according to the Germans, military 
necessity takes precedence over international law, 
and he quotes the following as an example of this 
logic of militarism: 

" No inhabitant of the occupied territory is to be 
disturbed in the use and free disposition of his prop- 
erty; on the other hand the necessity of war justifies 
the most far-reaching disturbance, restriction, and 
imperiling of his property." 

For the benefit of your reviewer and of your read- 
ers, permit me to quote Article 3 of the American 
Naval War Code: 

" Military necessity permits measures that are in- 
dispensable for securing the end of the war, and that 
are in accordance with modern law and usage of war. 



. . . Non-combatants are to be spared in person 
and property during hostilities as much as the neces- 
sities of war and the conduct of such non-combatants 
will permit." 

And may I reall to the memory of Americans the 
conduct of our own troops in the Civil War and of 
England's troops in the Revolution, in South 
Africa, and in India? 

Your reviewer also speaks of " the German doc- 
trine ' Not kennt kein Gebot ' " (which, of course, 
he does not translate). But, pray, since when is 
the doctrine that necessity knows no law a German 
doctrine? Is it not rather a universal law founded 
in the instinct of self-preservation? 

Is it not time that all this lying about Germany 
stopped? Are Americans really so stupid, so 
bigoted, so narrow-minded, that they can not bear 
the truth? Or is all this vilification merely petty 
and picayune revenge for the Britons' incompe- 
tence in the present crisis in their history? 

Your reviewer states it as the final lesson of the 
War Book that Germany's conduct is guided by 
the principle, " anything to win." Let anyone 
read our own War Book or that of any other 
nation before whom England is now crooking the 
pregnant hinges of the knee, and he will find that 
all warring mankind makes this its guiding prin- 
ciple. We Americans, worshipping the ideal " suc- 
cess, success at any cost" (short of being found 
out) , whether it be in business or in politics, should 
be the last ones to throw stones at Germany for 
that. 

Finally permit me to express my astonishment 
that THE DIAL, a literary journal for people above 
the average intelligence, should have given room 
for a " review " so calculated to stir up prejudice 
and hatred in the hearts of its readers.

ELEMENTS OF THE SHORT STORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I wonder if a layman may voice his disagreement 
with the very interesting opinion of an expert con- 
cerning short stories and their place in literature 
(see Mr. Charles Leonard Moore's article in your 
issue of September 2) ? Is not the importance of 
quantity largely over-emphasized in Mr. Moore's 
appraisal? The qualitative character of the story 
may depend more upon the writer than the limita- 
tions in length. Whoever has read the short stories 
of Tourguenieff, Chekhoff, and Gorki (all available 
in English translations) will scarcely agree with 
the statements that " character, its development 
and its oppositions, the form hardly has room for " 
and " great action, passion, thought can hardly be 
developed." Chekhoff's short stories, except for 
his earliest period, are all character and very little 
action. The same is true of Gorki ; while in Tour- 
guenieff's tales there is no dearth of passion. The 
American short story, especially the popular type, 
is largely anecdote; but that seems to be a fault 
rather of our national psychology than of the 
inevitable limitations of the literary form.

A CENTURY'S RECORDS OF Two FAMOUS 
FAMILIES.* 



It was a happy thought to put together for 
publication the Wedgwood-Darwin-Allen let- 
ters of a century. Centring around the per- 
sonality of Emma Wedgwood, wife of Charles 
Darwin, the story reveals not only that noble 
character, but also the intimate life of all 
those nearest to her. We see the non-scientific 
side of Charles Darwin, his happiness and 
troubles, his hopes and fears, and how com- 
pletely these were shared by her of whom he 
characteristically said : " I marvel at my good 
fortune, that she, so infinitely my superior in 
every single moral quality, consented to be my 
wife." More than this, we make the acquain- 
tance of a group of persons belonging to three 
closely connected families, almost all of them 
with a certain flavor of genius, a distinction 
of character which commands our admiration 
and respect, as it did that of their contempo- 
raries. Those who achieved eminence seem 
less exceptional when seen on the background 
of their family life, which was itself main- 
tained at so high a level. 

In 1792 Josiah Wedgwood of Maer Hall 
married Elizabeth Allen of Cresselly; and 
Emma, born in 1808, was their ninth and last 
child. The letters of this early period intro- 
duce us to the older generation, the parents, 
aunts, and uncles of Emma, who not only 
made the environment of her early life, but 
some of them lived to see its fruition in rela- 
tively modern times. Nearly all through the 
book, always very much alive and with a great 
deal to say for herself, appears the figure of 
Fanny Allen, who died in 1875 at the age of 
94. No less interesting is Jessie Allen, who 
married the historian J. C. de Sismondi, and 
died in 1853. Another aunt, Catherine, or 
Kitty, was the wife of Sir James Mackintosh, 
who was prominent in the politics and society 
of the early part of the century. The Aliens 
and Wedgwoods were in the midst of what- 
ever was going on, and there are many anec- 
dotes of famous men and women. Madame 
de Stael appears a number of times, and it is 
interesting to-day to read that at a party in 
1813 she " harangued for half-an-hour against 
peace," but "this was so entirely against the 
sentiments of every one present that Lord 
Holland . . gravely declared his opinions were 
entirely contrary to hers on that subject." 



* EMMA DARWIN. A Century of Family Letters, 1792-1896. 
Edited by her daughter Henrietta Litchfield. In two volumes. 
Illustrated in photogravure, etc. New York : D. Appleton & Co. 



The diary of Emma Caldwell, written in 
1819, gives a vivid account of the manner in 
which the Wedgwoods of Maer brought up 
their children : 

" The part of the intellectual character most im- 
proved by the Wedgwood education is good sense, 
which, is indeed their preeminent quality. It is 
one of the most important, and in the end will pro- 
mote more of their own and others happiness than 
any other quality. The moral quality most pro- 
moted by their education is benevolence, which 
combined with good sense, gives all that education 
can give. The two little girls [one of those re- 
ferred to being Emma] are happy, gay, amiable, 
sensible, and though not particularly energetic in 
learning, yet will acquire all that is necessary by 
their steady perseverance. They have freedom in 
their actions in this house as well as in their princi- 
ples. Doors and windows stand open, you are no- 
where in confinement; you may do as you like; 
you are surrounded by books that all look most 
tempting to read ; you will always find some pleas- 
ant topic of conversation, or may start one, as all 
things are talked of in the general family. All this 
sounds and is delightful." 

A few years later, the question of slavery 
was to the front, and we find the Maer family 
ardent abolitionists. In 1824, Fanny Allen 
gives a remarkable account of an anti-slavery 
speech by Lord Brougham which she heard in 
the House of Commons : 

" Brougham's speech was delightful. He spoke 
for an hour and 10 or 20 minutes, and it was the 
most incomparable thing I ever heard. I could 
have screamed or jumped with delight. He han- 
dled Scarlett and Canning to my soul's con- 
tent tossed them about like a cat a couple of 
mice from one paw to another, teased them and 
threw them into the air, with equal grace and 
strength." 

In 1831 we find Elizabeth Wedgwood, Emma's 
oldest sister, writing thus : " The thing I am 
most anxious to hear is the debate on Tuesday 
on slavery. Macaulay's speech on the reform 
bill almost made me cry with admiration, and 
I expect his speech on so much more interest- 
ing a subject to be the finest thing that ever 
was heard." 

Charles Darwin scarcely enters the narra- 
tive until his return from his voyage around 
the world, when we find him the centre of 
interest, much wondered at and admired. 
Emma writes to her sister-in-law: "We en- 
joyed Charles's visit uncommonly. . . Charles 
talked away most pleasantly all the time ; we 
plied him with questions without any mercy." 
The second volume opens with the engage- 
ment of Charles Darwin and Emma Wedg- 
wood, an event which gave unqualified delight, 
not only to the principals, but to all the rela- 
tives. Nothing could be more charming than 
the letters of this period; we will only quote 



264 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 30 



Emma's opinion of Charles, as expressed in a 
letter to her Aunt Jessie Sismondi : 

" I must now tell you what I think of him, first 
premising that Eliz. thinks pretty nearly the same, 
as my opinion may not go for much with you. He 
is the most open, transparent man I ever saw, and 
every word expresses his real thoughts. He is par- 
ticularly affectionate and very nice to his father 
and sisters, and perfectly sweet tempered, and pos- 
sesses some minor qualities that add particularly 
to one's happiness, such as not being fastidious, 
and being humane to animals." 

A friend writes to Emma : " You two will be 
quite too happy together, and I hope you will 
have a chimney that smokes, or something of 
that sort to prevent your being quite intoxi- 
cated." They were married on January 29, 
1839 ; the rest of the story has to do with 
their life together, and the lives of their 
children. 

"We have long known the main facts of Dar- 
win's life, how he struggled against ever- 
recurring illness, and in spite of all managed 
to do a prodigious amount of work. We have 
understood that his wife was an essential fac- 
tor in all this ; but now for the first time we 
are enabled to appreciate the beauty and 
strength of her character, and to see that she 
was very much more than a mere background 
for her illustrious husband. He also appears 
in a somewhat new light; and if anyone still 
has the illusion that the patron saint of 
naturalists lacked normal human qualities, 
this should be dispelled. Nothing could be 
more erroneous than the idea that Darwin's 
emotions and sympathies were dried up by his 
scientific pursuits. After Charles Darwin's 
death, his son Francis undertook to write his 
Life. Mrs. Darwin felt a shrinking dread of 
the publicity, but when she saw the book she 
was completely satisfied. 

"I have been_ reading Frank's notes. . . I am 
quite delighted with them. The picture is so mi- 
nute and exact that it is like a written photograph, 
and so full of tender observation on Frank's part. 
The whole picture makes me feel astonished at 
myself that I can make out a cheerful life after 
losing him. He filled so much space with his inter- 
est, sympathy and graciousness, besides his love 
underlying and pervading all. I think Frank has 
done so wisely in writing down every thing. I 
wrote a little note to him, as I knew I should break 
down in telling him what I felt." 

At the end of the book, as a postscript, is a 
brief account of the life of Erasmus Darwin, 
grandson of Charles and Emma Darwin, who 
was killed in action in the vicinity of Ypres, 
April 17, 1915. "There never was, that I 
ever met, a man so strong and yet so gentle," 
writes a dear friend, who was killed in action 
only a fortnight later. 



We rise from the book with a strong feeling 
that the story is not yet all told; that the 
Wedgwood-Darwin blood has yet much to do 
in the world, and it may well be that the 
record of the twentieth century will be read 
by posterity with as much interest and pleas- 
ure as we have found in following the history 
of the century past. T> D _ A> CocKERELL . 



THE 



RUSSIA.* 



An interesting development of the past 
quarter-century has been the change of atti- 
tude on the part of western Europe toward 
Russia and things Russian. A generation ago 
Russia, save within very restricted circles, was 
regarded as a vast, undeveloped, conglomerate 
empire, whose government was hopelessly au- 
tocratic and corrupt, and whose people were 
ignorant, intolerant, unproductive, barbarous, 
non-European, and largely incapable of prog- 
ress. To-day the Empire is considered one 
of the great and promising states of Europe, 
its government virile and in some degree 
enlightened, its people industrious, ambitious, 
serious, and possessed of large actual and 
latent culture. 

The change of view has come in part be- 
cause the realities of Russian life and char- 
acter have been made known as never before 
by travellers and writers, and by the transla- 
tion and diffusion of Russian literature. It is 
attributable in no small measure, also, to the 
fact that Russian government and economic 
and social organization have undergone a con- 
siderable transformation under the eyes of 
the present-day world. Heroic, if not always 
successful, attempts at reform have caught 
the attention, and have commanded the sym- 
pathy, of western peoples. 

Just now the currents of opinion regarding 
Russia are flowing strong and they are unusu- 
ally interesting, even though not very convinc- 
ing. Amid the stress of the war, sentiment 
upon this as upon every other political and 
social matter tends to be deepened and 
warped to accord with the exigencies of the

situation. From German sources we are hear- 
ing again that the Russian is an unregenerate 
barbarian, whose influence, were it to be 
further extended, would be the bane of Euro- 
pean civilization. From English and French 
sources we are being assured that the Russian 
is an altogether good sort of fellow, that he is 
on the high-road of political and social better- 
ment, and that from his larger participation 
in European and world affairs civilization has 
nothing to fear. Unsuspected frailties are 
matched by unsuspected virtues, until the 
impression is inevitably forced that there has 
been a deal of exaggeration on both sides. 

From the mass of books relating to Russia 
which have poured from the presses since the 
war began, one easily selects as most worth 
while "An Interpretation of the Russian Peo- 
ple," written by Professor Leo Wiener of 
Harvard University. Professor Wiener is 
Russian born and reared, and the subject of 
his prolonged researches and teaching has 
been the Slavic languages and literatures, 
especially the Russian. His attachment to his 
native country is close, yet at times he has 
been its unsparing critic. No man in Amer- 
ica, perhaps no man anywhere, is better fitted 
to interpret Russia, more particularly Russian 
culture, to the western world. 

The volume in hand undertakes such an 
interpretation. The object is stated to be 
"the ascertainment of those spiritual princi- 
ples which alone can help the reader to com- 
prehend and properly weigh the curious and 
frequently unique phenomena in the social 
and artistic life of Russia." There is no at- 
tempt at a formal or continuous history of 
Russian thought, literature, or art; so that 
to be read most effectively by one not reason- 
ably acquainted with that history, the book 
should be preceded by such treatises as Mr. 
Maurice Baring's " The Russian People " and 
his recent " Outline of Russian Literature " in 
the "Home University Library." After two 
introductory chapters in which are depicted 
clearly some of the fundamentals of the Rus- 
sian character and of the historical develop- 
ment of Russian life, Professor Wiener writes 
principally of the national ideals as expressed 
in Russian literature, of "art for art's sake" 
in Russia, of Russian music as an expression 
of the popular mind, of the Russian religion, 
of the " intellectuals " and the masses, of the 
peasants, and of the position and influence of 
Russian women. 

Perhaps the most original and illuminating 
of Professor Wiener's observations is that re- 
lating to the Russian's propensity to show to 
the world the worst that is in him, combined 
with his habit of self-abnegation. There is 



little or no effort in Russia, we are told, to 
keep the seamy side of life, whether individ- 
ual or social, from view. In matters of morals 
the Russian is not notably worse than other 
men; he is merely less cautious, less hypo- 
critical. " The criminal instincts are more 
obvious, not more serious, in Russia than else- 
where." Furthermore, the Russian delights 
in self-castigation. The brilliant Irish writer, 
Mr. E. J. Dillon, whose "Russian Character- 
istics" (published in 1892) contains one of 
the most scathing denunciations of all things 
Russian ever written, lives in Petrograd, a 
highly honored man, and his book is actually 
popular. The Russians take a curious sort of 
satisfaction in recitals of their shortcomings. 
They make their foibles and sins "visible," 
while other peoples seek to conceal their weak- 
nesses under a cloak of sanctimonious proprie- 
ties. The point may be over-emphasized, but 
it carries enough weight to justify the author 
in warning his readers against books upon 
Russia written by hasty observers who, misled 
by the unreserved frankness of the Slav, 
assume that where there is so much open cor- 
ruption there must be at least as much as in 
other countries that is hidden from view. 

Another interpretation of Russia by a 
Russian dwelling in a foreign land is Vino- 
gradoff s " The Russian Problem." This little 
book contains only a popular lecture entitled 
" Russia after the War," and a reprinted let- 
ter to the London " Times " on the psychology 
of the Russian nation. The standing of the 
author, however, gives it importance. After 
serving as professor of history in the Uni- 
versity of Moscow, and after suffering banish- 
ment for his liberal views, Vinogradoff was 
appointed some years ago to a professorship 
of jurisprudence in the University of Oxford, 
and he has taken first rank as a scholar in the 
field of mediaeval English agrarian history. 
The volume in hand is too brief to go far in 
the way of interpretation. It is rather a 
defence, its contents being prompted largely 
by recent German slurs upon Russian civiliza- 
tion, and it is intended to reassure the English 
that they are not fighting hand in glove with 
sheer barbarians. The author concurs with 
Dr. Wiener in a dislike for autocracy, in re- 
gret for the slipping back of Russia in consti- 
tutional matters since 1906, and in the belief 
that the salvation of the country lies in the 
extension of public education and in the solu- 
tion of the land question. He believes, how- 
ever, that Russia has need of strong monarchy, 
just as France had need of strong monarchy 
in the thirteenth century and England in the 
fifteenth; and he contends that it would be a 
fatal mistake to indulge in anti-monarchical,

anti-dynastic agitation. It is his hope that the 
Imperial Government "shall be able to per- 
ceive that the uncontested leadership of the 
nation through this war imposes the moral 
obligation of generous and far-sighted ac- 
tion." He is more sanguine, if not concerning 
the final outcome, at least concerning the more 
immediate effects of the war upon Russian 
government and social conditions, than is 
Professor Wiener. 

A volume of similar purport by an English- 
man is Mr. J. W. Mackail's " Russia's Gift to 
the World." The author starts with the pre- 
mise that the cultural achievements of Russia 
are largely unknown to the English, as to 
other western peoples. These achievements, 
he maintains, are many and varied, even 
though Russia is the last of the great states 
of Europe to undergo a modernizing regenera- 
tion. The subjects considered, in all cases 
very briefly, are literature, music, art, the 
drama, natural science, and the social sciences. 
The brochure has value as a popular hand- 
book. More than that it does not pretend to 
be. It is commendable for its moderation of 
statement and for its general accuracy. 

The principal value of Mr. Stephen Gra- 
ham's earlier writings on Russia arises from 
the splendid portrayal of the Russian peasant 
character contained in them. Mr. Graham, 
who is himself something of a mystic, has 
been strongly attracted by the simple, honest, 
uncommercial, mystical peasant temperament, 
and by Russia as the " sanctuary from West- 
ernism." He has travelled extensively among 
the peasants, lived with them, journeyed with 
them as a pilgrim to Jerusalem, and written 
about them charmingly in "Undiscovered 
Russia " and other books. In his most recent 
volume, " Russia and the World," which con- 
sists chiefly of articles published originally in 
English and American magazines, he records 
some of the impressions gathered on a long 
and arduous tramp across Russian Central 
Asia to the frontier of China, mainly through 
the great region of southern Siberia where 
Russian emigration and colonization can best 
be studied at close range. But in the main 
he writes of Russia in relation to the presenj; 
war and as a factor in world politics. Upon 
this subject he is interesting, yet he has no 
great contribution to make. Russia, he says, 
is fighting fundamentally to preserve her 
national life and religion, "that she may go 
on being herself." To Mr. Graham's mind, 
the worst thing that can happen to the Em- 
pire is to be Westernized and made like other 
countries. The nation's present cause is just 
and sacred, for, as he views the matter, it 
involves the right of a great, albeit primitive, 



civilization to exist and grow. Of the future 
of Russia as the dominant land-empire of the 
Eastern world the author entertains never a 
doubt. 

Mr. Denis Garstin's "Friendly Russia," 
made up of journalistic matter supplied by 
the author to various London periodicals, is 
yet another volume written with the manifest 
purpose of commending Russia to her English 
allies. In his opening chapter the author con- 
fesses that the word " Russia " has always sent 
a little tremor of excitement down his back, 
"pregnant with wolves, passion, and savag- 
ery," and he admits that although he should 
live in the country for the rest of his life it 
always would continue to do so. The burden 
of his book, however, is the distinction be- 
tween the two Russias the ogre-land of 
wolves, knouts, serfdom, and cruelty, and the 
Russia actually to be seen by the twentieth 
century traveller and observer. And we have 
the word of Mr. H. G. Wells, in an Introduc- 
tion from his pen which the volume carries, 
that the distinction is "very neatly" drawn. 
Twenty sketchy chapters of impressions, anec- 
dotes, and reminiscences are devoted to Rus- 
sia in peace ; five more to Russia in war. The 
book's only merit lies in its somewhat inti- 
mate, even if wholly unsystematic, view of 
everyday Russian life. 

An unpretentious body of reminiscences of 
Russian travel is contained in Mr. John Hub- 
back's "Russian Realities." Here again one 
finds only lightly recorded impressions, yet 
the average reader coming to the subject with- 
out previous knowledge could very likely 
learn more about Russia from this book than 
from any other one mentioned in the subjoined 
list. The physical aspect of the country is 
well described. But of history, psychology, 
and economics there is little, and that of no 
distinguished quality. 

"Abused Russia," by Dr. C. C. Young, is a 
volume written specifically to demonstrate 
that in times past grave injustice has been 
done Russia by those western peoples who have 
presumed to judge her policies and measures. 
The author makes no attempt to gloss over 
those aspects of Russian politics and morals 
which give ground for honest criticism. But 
he urges that the existence of certain grave 
defects be not permitted to give color to the 
whole of western opinion concerning the coun- 
try. The passport system and the treatment 
of the Jews he condemns. But he contends 
that a candid study of the history of these 
matters will reveal extenuating circumstances. 
If not at all points convincing, the argument 
is of some weight. The book is copiously sup- 
plied with excellent illustrations.

A VIENNESE PLAYWRIGHT IN ENGLISH.* 



The deep-seated American or is it an 
Anglo-Saxon ? habit of judging all art, and 
especially literary art, by its conformity to 
conventional morality is almost certain to 
prevent for a long time the complete recog- 
nition here of one of the subtlest of modern 
European dramatists and poets, Arthur 
Schnitzler. Over all his work, or at least over 
all of it that has been translated into English, 
there hangs what our popular critics are sure 
to interpret as the poisonous miasma from a 
very morbid kind of life, it is so difficult for 
most of us to see in an artist's preoccupation 
with erotic psychology, and with other forms 
of nevrosity, anything but an unhealthy 
dwelling upon unpleasant subjects. In fact, 
this general impatience with attempts to ex- 
press fine shades of temperament, this blind- 
ness in respect to artistic experiment and 
exploration in hazy borderlands of expe- 
rience, may easily cause Schnitzler's books to 
be anathematized, unless they are cast aside 
as merely dull and unnatural, by those who 
fail to penetrate their allusive delicacy and 
their witty indirectness. 

And yet Schnitzler is becoming fairly well 
known this side the water. "Anatol," his 
early series of dialogues, airiest of. com- 
edies, had long runs in New York and Chi- 
cago, and introduced to large audiences its 
author's most typical character. Anatol, the 
young aesthete of wealth and family, drifting 
from one exquisite moment to another, de- 
lighting in the analysis of fleeting sensations,

demanding no purpose, no responsibility, no 
continuity, and no finality in love and life, is 
a figure that reappears again and again in 
Schnitzler's work. Under the name of Fritz, 
in " Playing at Love," he loses his superficial 
resemblance to an Oscar Wilde hero, and 
becomes at once more recognizable and more 
hateful, for this tragedy shows with the ut- 
most poignancy the horror that may result 
from light loving when on one side there is 
serious passion and on the other merely a 
wish for diversion. Prince Egon, another 
version of the same type, who saunters not 
very gracefully through the play entitled 
" Countess Mizzie," has better luck than his 
fellows; but this is entirely because he is 
thrown into relations with a wpman of strong 
nature, and not because he is self-controlled. 

The background of all these plays, as of 
most of Schnitzler's novels and dramas, is the 
complex and highly sophisticated Viennese 
society in which he has lived. It is a world 
less fixed than ours, a world of loose ends, 
of shifting, dizzily shifting, values, where 
people are to each other like chameleons col- 
ored by passing situations, and where ideas 
have no reality and no meaning except as 
they rise mist-like from sensations delicious 
or painful but always teasing. Our own 
familiars, business, politics, social reform, 
appear only as flickering shadows on a wall, 
cast up from a window giving on a crowded 
street or court without. Of these shadows 
the most recurrent seems to bear a vague rela- 
tion to political events ; and in these times of 
Austrian struggle, it looms up in large and 
sinister outline. National disunion, class 
hatred and distrust are evident enough; a 
corrupt and hypocritical bureaucracy, self- 
interested reformers and a stupid public, may 
help to explain the present crookedness of 
events. Not that any of them are stressed at 
all; indeed, only in "Professor Bernardi" 
does a political intrigue really condition a 
plot, and even here it is held well in sub- 
ordination to the play's chief interest, the 
character of the doctor-professor. 

In the five brief acts of "Professor Ber- 
nardi," Schnitzler comes as close as so de- 
tached an observer could ever come to working 
out a distinct thesis, possibly because some 
of his own or his father's experiences as a 
physician have entered directly into the situ- 
ation dramatized. The protagonist, a Jewish 
surgeon of distinction, is driven from his posi- 
tion at the head of a large charity hospital, 
hounded out of professional life, and finally 
sent to prison because he refuses to allow a 
Christian priest to make miserable with ques- 
tions and threats a dying "sinner's" last

hours. Dr. Bernard! accepts all the tragic 
consequences of his act as inevitable in such 
a society, and insists that they are absolutely 
without effect upon his real self. So inde- 
pendent and so profoundly clear-sighted is 
he, so sure of the Tightness of his judgments 
and the value of his work, and equally of the 
impossibility of its being understood, that he 
passes untouched through what to a weaker 
man would have been the depths of humilia- 
tion. He says at the end of the play, in 
explanation of his attitude and in answer to 
the plea of his friends that he demand a 
revision of his case : 

" 'All my plans have vanished. . . . When I 
started to write that [a book presenting his views] 
my wrath melted. From the accusations against 
Flint and his consorts, I drifted into Austrian 
politics; then into philosophy and ethical respon- 
sibility, revelation and freedom of the will.' 

" ' That is always the case/ says Winkler, ' if 
you go to the root of the thing. It is better to put 
on the brakes sooner, for some fine day you begin 
to understand to pardon everything and then 
where is the charm of life, if you cannot love or 
hate any more ? ' 

" * Oh, one goes on loving and bating. . . I did 
not want to solve a problem. I only did what I 
considered right in a special case.' " 
This conclusion, which to the practical person 
might seem the ultimate destruction of all 
values, is actually the most positive kind of 
assertion of the modern individualist's creed. 
The self-sufficiency which results from wide 
comprehension, the independence born of a 
realization both of the individual's creative 
power and of the limits to that power, these 
are the central themes focussing Schnitzler's 
as well as many another modern's work. 

It is lack of strength, and so of self-suffi- 
ciency, that brings about Christine's tragedy 
in "Playing with Love" ("Liebelei "), and 
Robert's tragedy in " The Mate " ; both go on 
living lies more .or less consciously for want 
of independence and the force to make their 
lives sincere. "Be something, have so much 
in yourself that when you are deprived of 
position, of love, of every tie, yet there will 
always remain sufficient within yourself, "- 
Hermann Bahr's comment on " Liebelei " 
might be extended in its application to sev- 
eral of Schnitzler's pieces. The positive and 
triumphant aspect of the creed is illustrated 
in " Dr. Bernardi," its tragedy in " The 
Lonely Way," most powerful of the later 
plays. 

Ibsen never painted a tenser succession of 
scenes than the sequence of quiet conversa- 
tions which in " The Lonely Way " reveal 
through skilful characterization the story of 
a long-dead passion and its fruits, and which 



lead finally to a double suicide and to the 
still more terrible destruction of cherished 
hopes and illusions. Anatol, aged and dis- 
satisfied, reappears here as Julian, a bitterly 
satiric portrait of the artistic dilettante who 
was drawn so much more tolerantly in the 
earlier dialogues. His actual unhappy loneli- 
ness is, however, no greater than that of any 
other person in the group ; mutual incompre- 
hension and consequent isolation are the rule 
of life, and the working-out to this realization 
by all the characters makes the tragedy of 
their situation. Again strength is lacking, 
not simply strength to stand upright with 
stiff muscles under the blows of fate, that 
is too grim and humorless an attitude to suit 
any artist with so much of non-Teutonic blood 
in his veins as this Viennese, but sufficient 
creative force to analyze and to enrich with 
interpretation every moment of life, no mat- 
ter how painful. Want of this superabun- 
dant vitality makes defeat a certainty to some 
unfortunates, as its mere possession enables 
others to triumph. 

Some minor studies of differing tempera- 
ments are exquisitely set in lower keys in the 
"Viennese Idylls," a very inappropriately 
titled collection of six unusually moving and 
various short stories. The influence of Freud 
and his school of psycho-analists is apparent 
in more than one passage of subtly presented 
mood, with its complex of emotion and of com- 
paratively unmarked external action. In 
each of these stories, as in the plays, the 
drama is primarily internal; the tension is 
of the terrifying kind that holds during a 
nightmare ; the characters are, many of them, 
endowed with the almost magical intuition 
which gives certain quiet and unimpressive 
persons the power to draw from commonplace 
events a very real aesthetic satisfaction, 
through their power to lose themselves in the 
effort of analysis and appreciation. For this 
satisfaction there can be no rule and no pre- 
cise preparation, though incidentally there 
must be no prejudices, there can only be 
power of the sort Schnitzler himself seems to 
possess to an unusual degree. Extraordinary 
receptiveness and sensitiveness, sympathies 
of the widest range, unusual intellect and cul- 
tivation, and a will determined to follow 7 the 
intricate windings of the human spirit into 
shadowy corners of hitherto stubborn reti- 
cences, with a patience (not always emulated 
by his translators) in expressing his themes 
through a transparently suitable style, a style 
vigorously direct and natural, picturesque, 
suggestive or allusive as the case demands, 
these are the marked characteristics of 
Schnitzler's work. Its whole effect is of a

richness, a disinterested sincerity, and a sub- 
tlety which many of our thinner and cruder 
and more clamorous young writers could do 
no better than to study. 

WINIFRED SMITH. 



THE BUILDING OF WASHINGTON.* 

A history of the city of Washington tran- 
scends the ordinary local history in scope, and 
acquires a national interest. The subject is 
one to which the Columbia Historical Society 
has for many years devoted its attention; 
the "History of the National Capital" by 
Mr. W. B. Bryan, one of its prominent mem- 
bers, may be looked 011 as a resultant or con- 
clusion of its researches to the time of writing. 
This must not be said without a corresponding- 
emphasis on the personal factor, for ' Mr. 
Bryan's work is not a second-hand summary 
of the monographs of others, but the product 
of extended individual researches in the ar- 
chives of the government and in contemporary 
documents generally. The first volume to 
appear covers the decisive period from the 
beginnings of the city to the British destruc- 
tions of 1814. The planning of the city itself, 
the design and building of the Capitol and the 
President's house, the share in these matters of 
Washington and Jefferson, and of the archi- 
tects and engineers, are subjects which have 
more than a local importance. 

The struggle over the location of the seat 
of government, antecedent to the Residence 
Act of 1790, is one which has been often de- 
scribed ; so that it is properly treated, in the 
work in hand, by a relatively brief but intel- 
ligible resume. The subsequent proceedings 
under the act are much less known ; and they 
form the object of a large and original section 
of the book. The part of President Washing- 
ton in the establishment of the city, always 
predominant in the popular mind, has already 
been brought out in detail by Mr. Bryan's 
earlier publication of Washington's letters 
bearing on the matter. Washington's was the 
wise judgment and conciliatory spirit which 
secured the cooperation of the land owners, 
allayed sectional jealousy, and insisted on a 
stable policy in the execution of plans. Mr. 
Bryan now has opportunity to do justice to 
other actors in the enterprise, and he does not 
fail to give them their due share. The part of 
Jefferson, especially, which has been obscured 
by that of his superior in office, Mr. Bryan 
clearly recognizes. He emphasizes a point 
which any student of Jefferson's artistic inter-

millan Co. 



ests and architectural abilities would suspect, 
that in all which concerned the form of the 
city and the character of its buildings Jeffer- 
son was the' prime mover. The relative posi- 
tion of the public buildings, the rectangular 
groundwork of streets, the competition for 
architectural designs, were all his ideas. 

The estimate of L'Enfant, the French engi- 
neer who delineated the city plan, and was 
responsible for the radial avenues and for the 
detail of the design, has been the subject of 
more controversy than any other personal 
matter concerned in the founding of the city. 
The recent idealizers of L'Enfant have repre- 
sented him as a much injured man, whose ser- 
vices were neither appreciated nor rewarded. 
Mr. Bryan, who brings to bear fresh material 
concerning other phases of L'Enfant's career, 
takes a more judicial view. L'Enfant, who 
everywhere enacted the same role of brilliant 
} accomplishment, headstrong indiscretion, and 
disdainful rejection of compensations in- 
tended to be liberal, was temperamentally 
unfitted for the execution of the schemes he so 
finely conceived. 

In the discussion of the genesis of the de- 
signs of the Capitol and the President's House, 
Mr. Bryan is less successful, because he here 
; draws largely on previous monographic works 
which really do not conform to his own stand- 
ards of historical criticism. Mr. Glenn Brown's 
" History of the United States Capitol," and 
other writings, have adduced a mass of impor- 
tant drawings and a selection of interesting 
documents, but careful study in the same field 
should have shown that many of his conclu- 
sions are in need of drastic revision. Mr. 
Bryan does correct them in a few points, but 
repeats uncritically some of Mr. Brown's 
assertions, such as that the original draw- 
ings of Hoban for the President's House are 
not in existence, and that they contemplated 
a building with wings. He also makes bold 
to say that, as far as known, no other designs 
than those of Hoban, Hallet, and Collins 
were submitted in the competition for the 
President's House. As a matter of fact the 
Maryland Historical Society, the collections 
of which should be familiar to a student of 
the subject, preserves the designs of four 
other competitors, together with one of 
Hoban 's original drawings; and the Coolidge 
collection in Boston has another of JJoban's 
plans. By a very serious misquotation of one 
of Washington's letters (p. 203), Mr. Bryan 
is led to give the name of Hallet as the one 
essentially responsible for the revised plan of 
the Capitol adopted in 1793, whereas Wash- 
ington's meaning was that the plan might on 
the whole be considered as Thornton's.

These errors, although unfortunately im- 
portant, are not characteristic of the book, 
which in many cases says a final word on 
matters within its scope. Economic, social, 
educational, and legal problems are all com-

good deal that of a chronicle, lacking in relief 
and emphasis, this will not detract from its 
great usefulness as a book of reference.

AN AUTHORITATIVE HISTORY OF THE 
JAPANESE PEOPLE.* 



Notwithstanding the prominent place as- 
sumed and held by Japan in the developments 
of the past generation, it has not been easy 
for the western reader to find a scholarly and 
convenient history of that interesting land. 
Travel books and descriptive accounts with- 
out end were available, and few of them were 
worth the time spent in their perusal. His- 
tories there were, but so little had been done 
in exploring the great wealth of Japanese 
records that western students were ill pre- 
pared to present well reasoned narratives. 
The two massive volumes of Murdoch, and 
the papers of the Asiatic Society of Japan, 
were the best sources of information available 
in English. It is therefore with a keen sense 
of appreciation that everyone interested in 
Japan and the Japanese must welcome a work 
which assuredly "fills a long-felt want." 

"A History of the Japanese People, from 
the Earliest Times to the End of the Meiji 
Era" is the final work of the late Captain 
F. Brinkley, R.A., formerly editor of the 
"Japan Mail." Although written in col- 
laboration with Baron Kikuchi, former Presi- 
dent of the Imperial University at Kyoto, 
Baron Kikuchi gives practically all the credit 
to his senior colleague, asserting that his own 
"share is slight, consisting merely in general 
advice and in a few suggestions on some spe- 
cial points." Captain Brinkley has long been 
known as one of the most sympathetic inter- 
preters of modern Japan. A British officer, 
he early went to Japan, retired from the ser- 
vice, and became editor of the " Japan Mail," 
for many years the ablest conducted foreign 
newspaper in Tokyo. As the author of the 
histories of Japan and China in the " Orien- 
tal Series," and of the article on Japan in 
the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," he was well 
known abroad as a keen student, an open-

Times to the End of the Meiji Era. By Capt. F. Brinkley,

minded observer, and the master of a clear 
and graceful style. 

The time was ripe for this exceptionally 
well informed foreigner, who was "almost 
Japanese in his understanding of, and sym- 
pathy with, the Japanese people," to prepare 
this much needed brief history. In his own 
words : 

" During the past three decades Japanese stu- 
dents have devoted much intelligent labour to 
collecting and collating the somewhat disjointed 
fragments of their country's history. The task 
would have been impossible for foreign historiog- 
raphers alone, but now that the materials have 
been brought to light there is no insuperable diffi- 
culty in making them available for purposes of 
joint interpretation." 

One hundred and forty-three of these Japa- 
nese accounts are cited in the bibliography, 
and it is in the use of them that the supreme 
value of the present volume consists. 

In Captain Brinkley's book there is now 
available, for the general reader as well as 
for the student, a volume of 731 pages, 
printed on India paper and therefore of con- 
venient size, which gives a well balanced his- 
tory of the Japanese people in the light of the 
investigations of both Japanese and foreign 
scholars. It is not too much to assert that in 
spite of minor shortcomings it is distinctly 
the most useful work of its kind in existence. 

It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the 
many valuable features of this comprehen- 
sive work. In every period considerable 
attention is paid to the culture, the social 
order, the economic conditions. The illustra- 
tions, 150 in number, are well chosen, but in 
some cases have been carelessly placed so as 
to represent a chronological period different 
from the text. Readers unfamiliar with 
Japanese will find the frequent use of proper 
names tedious, and yet Captain Brinkley has 
avoided inconsequential details as much as 
possible. A single sentence, such as "the 
political complications that followed the death 
of the Taiko are extremely difficult to un- 
ravel, and the result is not commensurate 
with the trouble," covers a period on which 
a considerable controversial literature exists 
in Japanese. The frequent realignment of 
parties during the years of feudal anarchy is 
most difficult to follow, notwithstanding the 
author's effort to hold fast to the main lines 
of historical development. 

An endeavor to condense 1450 years of his- 
tory, and an uncertain epoch of mythology, 
into a single volume calls for rare talent in 
the art of omission. Frequently involved 
events must be described in summary phrases, 
and too often the dry bones of history lie

exposed without the covering of descriptive 
matter. And yet Captain Brinkley has been 
able to enliven his text with many incidents, 
extremely well chosen, which portray the 
genius of the people and their leaders. An 
illustration, which has several points of inter- 
est, is the following: 

" During the lifetime of leyasu, one of the most 
noted scholars was Fujiwara Seigwa. By the invi- 
tation of the Tokugawa chief he lectured on the 
classics in Kyoto, and it is recorded that leyasu, 
who had just (1600) arrived in that city, attended 
one of these lectures, wearing his ordinary gar- 
ments. Seigwa is related to have fixed his eyes on 
leyasu and addressed him as follows : ' The great- 
est work of Confucius teaches that to order one- 
self is the most essential of achievements. How 
shall a man who does not order himself be able to 
order his country? I am lecturing on ethics to 
one who behaves in a disorderly and discourteous 
manner. I believe that I preach in vain.' leyasu 
immediately changed his costume, and the event 
contributed materially to the reputation alike of 
the intrepid teacher and of the magnanimous stu- 
dent, as well as to the popularity of Seigwa's 
doctrines." 

It must not be forgotten that Captain 
Brinkley was evidently writing for the gen- 
eral public rather than for the special stu- 
dent, and therefore the absence of citations 
of the Japanese sources and the lack of in- 
cisive criticism in controversial matters are 
doubtless intentional. Notwithstanding the 
great number of unusual names, the text is 
remarkably clear of typographical errors, 
and misstatements of fact are rare. But that 
some should occur is scarcely surprising. In 
regard to the Shimonoseki complication 
(p. 674), the date should be June 24 or 25; 
and the firing on the American ship did not 
take place until June 26, instead of prior to 
May 11. And exception must be taken to the 
statement on p. 675 which credits Sir Harry 
Parkes with conceiving the idea of securing 
the Mikado's ratification of the foreign trea- 
ties by means of a naval demonstration at 
Hyogo; this proposal was first made by Mr. 
Pruyn, the American Minister, almost two 
years before Sir Harry arrived in Japan. 

It is to be hoped that this history of the 
Japanese people may have the wide circula- 
tion which it merits, and that it may con- 
tribute to a better understanding of a most 
interesting people with whom we are bound 
to come into increasingly closer relations. 

PAYSON J. TREAT. 

Although Mr. Edmund Gosse has completed his 
" Life of Swinburne," we understand that the book 
will not be published until after the war; when, 
presumably, we shall also be given Swinburne's 
correspondence and his posthumous poems. 



RECENT POETRY.* 

The decay of the hopes which were excited 
by the early work of Mr. Stephen Phillips is 
one of the tragedies of contemporary poetry. 
And his latest volume does nothing to miti- 
gate this tragedy. It consists largely of mat- 
ter such as one would expect to find published 
after the author's death by those persons who 
ransack the effects of deceased poets for new 
material wherewith to make "complete edi- 
tions," manuscripts, that is to say, which 
the writer himself knew better than to make 
public. Yet Mr. Phillips has not died. The 
banality and immelodiousness of many of 
these poems are almost incredible. Once their 
author was supposed to be the herald of a 
new narrative blank verse of no little power 
and beauty; he can now make such lines as 
the following the climax of the love-story of 
an English soldier and a wandering Moslem 
maiden : 

" ' Hath ever,' said he, ' such a feat of love 

Been known in this dull world as this of thine? 
Was ever so much risked or so much dared? 
Now to my mother will I make you known.' " 

The title poem, addressed to this country, is 
in heroic couplets of a second-rate eighteenth- 
century quality. In particular, there is a 
distinct echo of the gentlemanly Augustan 
who once described the grasshopper as "the 
crawling scourge that smites the leafy plain " 
in Mr. Phillips's account of the yellow-fever 
mosquito as 

" the fatal fly with baleful breath 
That bears on gaudy wings the buzzing death." 

As illustration for this poem, the frontispiece 
reproduces one of Mr. Joseph Pennell's etch- 
ings of the Gatun locks. It is well worth 
having, and furnishes the only reason I can 
think of why any one should possess the book. 
Or, if this be ungenerous, another reason may 
be found in the single poem called "Jesus 
and Joan," based on a fine bit of religious 
imagination : 

" When Jesus greeted Joan in the After-twilight, 
When the Crucified kissed the Burned,

[Sept, 30 



Then softly they spoke together, solemnly, sweetly, 

They two so branded with life. 

But they spoke not at all of cross, or of up-piled 

flaming, 

Or the going from them of God; 
But he was tender over the soul of the Roman 
Who yielded him up to the priest; 
And she was whist with pity for him that lighted 
The faggot in Rouen town." 

Of whatever is written by Mr. James Ste- 
phens, whether in prose or in verse, one may 
be sure that it will reveal a whimsical, Iris-like 
personality, darting unexpectedly from boy- 
like farce to the most matured sentiment, and 
always a distinguished sense of style. His 
" Songs from the Clay " are the utterance of 
this familiar personality, conscious now of its 
imprisonment in sordid clay, and again only 
of the stars that shine down upon the bog. 
I have drawn this figure from one of the 
poems themselves, which is addressed to " The 
Nodding Stars": 

" Brothers ! ' what is it ye mean ? 

What is it ye try to say? 
That so earnestly ye lean 
From the spirit to the clay. 

" There are weary gulfs between 

Here and sunny Paradise; 
Brothers! what is it ye mean 
That ye search with burning eyes 

"Down for me whose fire is clogged, 
Clamped in sullen earthly mould, 
Battened down and fogged and bogged 
Where the clay is seven-fold? " 

Close by it is this other, dealing with the 
same theme in the other mood : 

" While walking through the trams and cars 
I chanced to look up at the sky 
And saw that it was full of stars, 

" So starry-sown that you could not, 
With any care, have stuck a pin 
Through any single vacant spot. 

" And some were shining furiously, 
And some were big and some were small, 
But all were beautiful to see. 

" Blue stars and gold, a sky of grey, 

The air between a velvet pall; 

I could not take my eyes away. 

I 
" And there I sang this little psalm 

Most awkwardly, because I was 

Standing between a car and tram." 

The "New Poetry Series" devotes one of 
its issues, of less than forty pages, to poems 
on the present war, by Mr. Laurence Binyon. 
They are sturdy, dignified utterances, full of 
feeling, but of such restrained feeling as an 
Englishman will show; sometimes rising to 
really noble levels, sometimes tending to be 
merely oratorical, as is almost inevitable in 
the extended treatment of such a subject. At 



its best, no doubt because most truly lyrical, 
the verse takes up a dirge " For the Fallen," 
whose partly irregular rhythm moves with a 
kind of sobbing pathos which is yet kept under 
stern control: 

" They went with songs to the battle, they were young, 
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. 
They were staunch to the end against odds 

uncounted, 
They fell with their faces to the foe. 

" They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow 

old: 

Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. 
At the going down of the sun and in the morning 
We will remember them. 

" They mingle not with their laughing comrades 

again; 

They sit no more at familiar tables of home; 
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time; 
They sleep beyond England's foam. 

" But where our desires are and our hopes profound, 
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight, 
To the innermost heart of their own land they are 

known. 
As the stars are known to the Night." 

The Poetry Bookshop of London has issued 
a new group of poetical "chapbooks," whose 
rather garish paper covers, adorned with 
woodcuts of somewhat affected crudity, en- 
close widely varying contents. The only one 
of them which has appealed to me as of dis- 
tinctive interest is Miss Cornford's " Spring 
Morning." This little collection, unpreten- 
tious and naive in tone, represents a real indi- 
viduality and a gift for rapid, concentrated 
effectiveness of expression^ Take, for exam- 
ple, this sketch of a child's point of view : 

" My father's friend came once to tea. 
He laughed and talked. He spoke to me. 
But in another week they said 
That friendly pink-faced man was dead. 



"'How sad,' they said; 'the best of men ' 

So I said too, ' How sad '; but then 
Deep in my heart I thought with pride: 
' I know a person who has died.' " 

Or this, of "Autumn Morning at Cambridge" : 

" Down in the town, off the bridges and the grass 
They are sweeping up the leaves to let the people 

pass; 

Sweeping up the old leaves, golden-reds and browns, 
While the men go to lecture with the wind in their 

gowns." 

Greater England is represented by a vol- 
ume from an Australian poet, Miss Dorothea 
Mackellar, whose verse, it appears, has be- 
come known before this in her own continent. 
The larger world should make her acquain- 
tance, for not only does she present some 
vivid glimpses of her own unfamiliar land, 
but her art shows a fluent sense of both color 
and melody, that catches the attention apart 
from the incidental interest of the back-

ground. Color most of all; one poem cele- 
brates the joy of it in a veritable hymn of 
praise for "saffron sunset clouds, and lark- 
spur mountains," for " nights of blue and 
pearl," for " beaches yellow as sunburnt 
wheat," and the "wide purple sea." In 
others the pageant of Australian landscapes 
is made to pass by: 

" The tragic ring-barked forests 

Stark white beneath the moon, 
The sapphire-misted mountains, 

The hot gold hush of noon. 
Green tangle of the brushes 

Where lithe lianas coil, 
And orchids deck the tree-tops 

And ferns the crimson soil." 

Or thanks are given 

" For the pine-tree like a church-spire, that grows 

upon the ridge, 
For the lizard at its foot, . . . 

" And the luminous red leaves of the sapling gums in 

spring, 
And the fen-lake's reed-grown marge." 

Space must also be found for some lines from 
a charmingly facile and intimate lyric called 
" The Explorer": 

' Had I been Adam in Eden-glade 
I should have climbed the wall 
Or ever the Woman found the fruit, 
Crimson and ripe to fall. . . . 

" I'd think of naught save the wall, but gain 

Over the other side 
A fair mixed world of evil and good, 
Chancy and wild and wide. . . . 

" Had I been Adam in Par-adise 

I should ha' climbed the wall; 
T want not only the sweet of life 
But all all all ! " 

Turn we now to our own country. A sec- 
ond book of verse by Fannie Stearns Davis 
(Mrs. Gifford) will find readers to welcome it 
who have known a number of the poems in 
familiar periodicals, as well as those who 
enjoyed the writer's earlier volume. The 
title-poem of " Crack o' Dawn " is wrought 
about the same theme as William Vaughn 
Moody's " Gloucester Moors," and all through 
the book runs the like interweaving of joy in 
nature with a sense of world-sorrow because 
of the sins and inadequacies of society. 

" How dare I drink heaven-dew 
While those I love drink death?" 

This is the poignant query of so many voices 
of our generation. Mrs. Gifford seems just 
a little too insistent on the sorrow that under- 
lies all human experience. I have always 
resented the type of cradle-song which con- 
cludes by intimating to the infant that " sor- 
row is coming by-and-by," or that "soon 
comes the sleep that has no waking," or other 



such undeniably true generalization. For, 
since the lyric deals with momentary feeling, 
not with the exposition of the whole subject, 
it is right that at times it should confine itself 
to the absolutely simple joy, if we are still 
capable of having simple joys. In one of the 
most pleasant of her poems Mrs. Gifford takes 
precisely this point of view: 

" The hills are green and simple folk ; 

The wind is quick with comrade-calls; 
White wayside apple-trees, and smoke 
Of woodfires, and bright waterfalls, 

" They never bid me understand. 

They never say, ' You too must die.' 
I will go take the wind's cold hand. 
God knows, I cannot always cry! " 

And we are grateful for this. The only trou- 
ble is, the thing is evidently done with an 
effort, the poet doth protest too much; if 
she were really convinced that she need not 
always cry, she would have said nothing about 
it. But it would be unjust to imply that this 
mood of half-tones or mixed tones dominates 
the whole collection. Sometimes, as in " Wild 
Weather," there is real freedom from the 
doubts of both philosopher and sociologist: 

" My lips with salt were wild to taste. 
I leapt: I shouted and made haste: 
Along the cliffs, above the sea, 
With mad red mantle waving free, 
And hair that whipped the eyes of me. 

" And there was no one else but he, 
That great grim wind who called to me. 
Oh, we ran far! Oh, we ran free! " 

Nor could anything be more simply and vera- 
ciously happy than the "Fire Fantasy" of 
the child who lies dreaming 

" on the fox-skin, white 
As silver under the leaping light, 
White and furry and kind and warm, 
[While] out by the window scurries the storm." 

Mrs. Gifford's technique is noticeably sure 
and sound. Though touched by the Welt- 
schmerz, she has not been convicted of the sin- 
fulness of true rhythm or melodious rhyme, 
and one may follow her through many lyrical 
movements with security and pleasure. The 
limitations of her lyrical art are summed up 
in saying that it is wholly feminine ; perhaps 
not one of her poems fails to show the lam- 
bent, flame-like feeling that we know to be 
characteristic of the poetic in woman. A 
more symmetrical or completer art demands,, 
of course, the sense that the masculine'is pres- 
ent in it too. 

Mr. Brian Hooker has collected his poems 
for the first time, and one may assume that 
he includes work going back to comparatively 
youthful years. There is, at any rate, an air 
of youthfulness about the volume, not in 



274

[Sept. 30 



the way of immaturity, much less of sauei- 
ness, but from the sense that here is abundant 
experimentation interesting as promise rather 
than as accomplishment. There are ballades 
and sonnets, melodious and well wrought; 
there are couplets and blank verse ; there are 
songs which show the none too common sense 
of that which in words is really akin to music ; 
and there are pleasing experiments in a new 
form, akin to the triolet, which the inventor 
names the " Turn." Of this last an example 
may be given at once : 

" Love came back to look once more 
On the home he long had known: 

Found a vine across the door, 
Found the fountain foul and dry, 

Found the garden overgrown; 
Heard at last a tired sigh. 

Love came back to look once more." 

But in all this one is not sure that one knows 
where the poet himself is to be found what 
it is, after preparation and prelude, that he 
wishes to say. The most extensive composi- 
tion in the volume is " The "White Cat," a 
symbolic fairy-poem on the theme "That 
every quest is but a coming home " ; the nar- 
rative is lucid and facile, but memorable less 
for itself than for some fine passages of ornate 
Tennysonian blank verse. Since for the pres- 
ent reviewer this term " Tennysonian " is not 
the malignant reproach which it becomes on 
the lips of many of our contemporaries, let me 
quote from one or two of these passages, in 
evidence of the good hope we may have for 
Mr. Hooker's further work in the field of epic 
or romance : 

" Clambering a rocky slope interminable, 
He reached the height, and paused, and standing 

there 

Fronted a firm wind, and the mist fell, blown 
Asunder, and the stars shone. All around, 
Vast mountains bulked against an ebony sky 
League beyond league, crested with snow, and 

floored 

With sea-green pines; as though the almighty deep, 
Heaving his foamy legions to the war 
Of the four winds, hung suddenly motionless 
A storm in stone." 

" Slowly as one that from the house of death 
Bitterly escaping, swims through fires of pain 
And storms of fever, and black floods of sleep, 
Till at the last his soul, returning, clears 
Faint eyes, and with a dim wonder he sees 
The strange walls of his own remembered room, 
Where the gray day, through curtains closely drawn, 
Sickens the lamplight, and the house is still." 

If that sort of thing seems old-fashioned, it 
does not follow that its charm should ever be 
obsolete. 

Leaving behind, however, as our generation 
is tending to do, the more conventional and 
ornate poetic modes, we find ourselves realiz- 



ing a problem of great concern in current 
poetry the new development of a verse 
style which shall seem to be very nearly that 
of common speech. The problem is not new, 
of course; Wordsworth set it forth clearly, 
but his methods and results in seeking to solve 
it were not quite so clear. Coventry Patmore 
made interesting experiments in the same 
direction, anticipating (in " The Angel in the 
House" and in other poems) a number of 
effects, both metrical and stylistic, which we 
are likely to think of as peculiar to the twen- 
tieth century. Browning, again, showed what 
could be done with every-day diction by his 
method, and Walt Whitman by his. But the 
present generation has gone to work with new 
seriousness to see how it can get both the 
full effect of poetry in prose, and the full 
effect of common speech in verse. So far as 
I know, the late John Synge is the only writer 
of English who has accomplished the first of 
these things, and that because of his discov- 
ery (or invention) of an extraordinary dia- 
lect; but that is not the question here. Mr. 
Masefield, in the second matter, was perhaps 
the first to do to perfection what Wordsworth 
saw from afar ; and he is having a number of 
followers, showing varying degrees of inde- 
pendent power. A fresh line of experimenta- 
tion in the new diction appears in Mr. Robert 
Frost's " North of Boston," which has already 
been noticed in these columns, but which I 
am glad to have occasion to mention again 
because, having first appeared and won atten- 
tion in England, the book is now reissued 
with an American imprint. There are few 
better examples of success in this direction 
than two or three of the poems in Mr. Mack- 
aye's new volume, " The Present Hour," 
especially the one called " Fight," which opens 
the collection, and that called " School," writ- 
ten as a tribute to an old New England acad- 
emy. Note passages like these : 

" Jock rammed his cap 
And rubbed a numb ear with the furry flap, 

Then bolted like a faun, 
Bounding through shin-deep sleigh-ruts in his shaggy 

brawn, 

Blowing white frost-wreaths from red mouth agap 
Till, in a gabled porch beyond the store, 
He burst the door." 

" He dropped his hoe, but sudden stooped again 
And raised it where it fell. Nothing he spoke, 
But bent his knee and crack! the handle broke 

Splintering. With glare of pain, 
He flung the pieces down, and stamped upon them; 

then 

Like one who leaps out naked from his cloak 
Ran. ' Here, come back ! Where are ye bound 
you fool? ' 

He cried ' To school ! ' " 



1915] 



THE DIAL

The whole of both poems should be consid- 
ered by any who have been led to believe that, 
in order to secure the effect of freedom, 
veracity, and directness, it is necessary to 
abandon the limitations of a fixed rhythmical 
form or the reasonable restraints and digni- 
ties of a sound style. I do not here undertake 
to speak of Mr. Mackaye's volume as a whole, 
for it is already not of "the present hour," 
but of that year 1914 which occurred so very 
long ago ; and its chief contents have become 
more or less familiar in periodicals. Like 
most of the author's work, it is notable for a 
wholesome combination of sincerity and dig- 
nity. It is consoling to contrast the simple 
but high feeling and expression of the two 
poems that deal with the Panama Canal, with 
the meretricious tawdriness of Mr. Phillips's 
composition on the same subject. From that 
made in honor of Colonel Goethals I quote the 
opening stanzas : 

" A man went down to Panama 

Where many a man had died 
To slit the sliding mountains 

And lift the eternal tide: 
A man stood up in Panama, 

And the mountains stood aside. 

" The Power that wrought the tide and peak 

Wrought mightier the seer; 
And the One who made the isthmus 

He made the engineer, 
And the good God he made Goethals 

To cleave the hemisphere." 

Perhaps the only thing one is tempted to 
wish for, in these poems of Mr. Mackaye's, is 
something more of the elan vital, the flaming 
lyrical glow and warmth, which characterize 
the last volume of our present list; and, by 
the same token, one might covet for Mr. Wit- 
ter Bynner a bit of Mr. Mackaye's restraint 
and sense of form. Even without it, " The 
New World" is a notable, a really golden 
book. This I say in the face of prejudices of 
which the reader of this journal has already 
become aware, and which force me to add that 
a modicum of metrical firmness and soberness, 
just by way of alternation let us say 
with the unhemmed, flood-like flowing and 
splashing of his fine eloquences, would cer- 
tainly better the work. Better it, that is, for 
those who do not find essential satisfaction in 
the form of lines like these: 

" Celia, hold out your hand, 
Or anyone in any field or street, hold out your 

hand 

And I can see it pulse the massive climb 
And dip 

Of this America, 
My ship! " 

Whitman, by the explicit announcement of 
the poet, is in part his inspiration; but I do 



not find either in the occasional sprawling 
Whitmanesque versification, or in the unrea- 
soned Whitman-like outpourings of a kind of 
chaotic, mystical patriotism, the new values 
of "The New World." There is a warm, 
lovable sociology here; and there is a relig- 
ious philosophy, seemingly somewhat Hindu 
in character, though the writer distinguishes 
it from Hinduism; but as I know only just 
enough of either sociology or philosophy to 
be suspicious of the soundness of Mr. Byn- 
ner's doctrines, as such, I cannot value the 
book by them. But that does not matter. 
Wordsworth said of his "Intimations" ode 
that he had made use of certain notions, " as 
a poet," without bothering as to whether or 
not they were demonstrably true; and that 
is certainly what most of us do in reading 
his great poem. So here; those of us who 
cannot follow Mr. Bynner's transcendental 
socialism and pantheism (I use neither word 
with technical accuracy) may rejoice in the 
clouds of glory which they trail as they come, 
and I do not mean mere beauty of figure 
and word, but nobility and loveliness of 
thought and feeling. There is a great woman 
portrayed in this poem; and the reader is 
led, with a passionate skill which he is likely 
not to realize or understand, to follow the 
revelation of her spirit, and at the end to feel, 
as the poet represents himself as feeling, that 
he has made, and lost, and yet not lost, a 
friend. At times Mr. Bynner's style gives us 
new examples of that search for directness 
and veracity which we have been remarking 
in others: 

" Be my reply 

Challenge to poets who, with tinkling tricks, 
Meet life and pass it by. 
' Beauty/ they ask, ' in politics? ' 
' If you put it there,' say I." 

At other times it rises and soars yet with- 
out altogether losing its directness on 
flights which to seek to follow is a rich new 
experience. I know of nothing in recent verse 
finer than this strophe, in a meditation on the 
nature of everlastingness : 

" Therefore, O spirit, as a runner strips 
Upon a windy afternoon, 
Be unencumbered of what troubles you 
Arise with grace 

And greatly go! the wind upon your face! 
Grieve not for the invisible transported brow 
On which like leaves the dark hair grew, 
Nor for those lips of laughter that are now 
Laughing in sun and dew, 
Nor for those limbs that, fallen low 
And seeming faint and slow, 
Shall alter and renew 
Their shape and hue 
Like birches white before the moon 
Or the wild cherry-bough 
In spring, or the round sea,

And shall pursue 

More ways of swiftness than the swallow dips 

Among, and find more winds than ever blew 

The straining sails of unimpeded ships! 

Mourn not! Yield only happy tears 

To deeper beauty than appears! " 

That two such volumes as Mr. Mackaye's 
and Mr. Bynner's should appear within a 
six months' period is of itself an augury of 
confidence for American poetry.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

Is there to be a revival of the sword-and-cloak 
romance? And is S. R. Crockett's "Hal o' the 
Ironsides" (Revell) one of its symptoms? Here 
is a tale more readable than stories of its kind 
seem to have been for several years past; and the 
point of view of the world, which has seen such 
abrupt transitions since Europe went mad last 
year, may now be favorable toward any attempt 
to interpret history, if only that we may gain from 
the past some clue to the tragedy that has just 
befallen mankind. "A Story of the Days of 
Cromwell " is the sub-title of the work. Read with 
modern eyes, one learns that the Ironsides were, in 
contemporary language, the product of an effi- 
ciency expert. Except for an oriental lapse into 
the improbable, which all the author's skill does 
not quite carry over, the book shows that judicious 
blending of love and war which gives to tales of 
this kind their popularity. 

Following his " Children of the Dead End," Mr. 
Patrick MacGill shows the seriousness with which 
he takes his calling by a more ambitious work in 
the same genre, "The Rat-Pit" (Doran). Like 
its predecessor, it is a sombre tale of humble life, 
taking its name from a Glasgow lodging-house for 
women, where no questions are asked and where 
life is to be seen in its most sordid aspects. An 
Irish peasant girl, Norah Ryan, gifted with un- 
usual beauties of soul and body, is made to yield 
herself to a middle-class scoundrel, after what most 
would adjudge an insufficient temptation, remem- 
bering the high moral standard of the Irish peas- 
ant. An outcast thereafter, she finds a single 
friend in an older woman whose experience had 
been the same as her own. It is a tragically realis- 
tic novel, evidencing marked literary skill. 

One acquits Mrs. Bell Elliott Palmer of intend- 
ing to write a suggestive book in " The Single Code 
Girl" (Lothrop), just as one exonerates her from 
intending to use slang when she puts it in the 
mouths of her most cultured and dignified char- 
acters at critical moments in their careers. But 
the fact remains that the element of suspense in 
her book is built upon the expected confession of 
a man's immorality, and it is in the hope that he 
will disclose some Cazanova-like escapade that 
most readers will follow the story. Surely 
enough, the expected disclosure comes near the end 
of the book and it is n't half as bad as it might 
have been, after all. And, the man not being so 



very bad, the girl marries him just the same. 
What the moral is, one cannot tell; yet there is no 
doubt about the author's intention to have one. 

California clutches the hearts of those who give 
themselves up to her charm, and Mrs. Mary Hal- 
lock Foote proves herself a thoroughgoing Cali- 
fornian in " The Valley Road " (Houghton). She 
even goes to the lengths of contrasting the best New 
England has to offer with the best of the Western 
Coast to the disparagement of neither, be it 
quickly said. The life of an engineer and of his 
son, an engineer after him, constitute the back- 
bone of the narrative, into which is woven more 
than one wholesome love story. The leading char- 
acters are Americans, but there is a background of 
immigrant life, of which we are dimly conscious, 
just as we are of this element in our national life. 
As one expects from a writer of Mrs. Foote's 
ability, this is a novel well worth the reading. 

Primitive conditions as tests whereby to try the 
souls of men make up the framework for the theme 
of Mr. Edwin Banner's story of " The Wild Goose 
Chase" (Duffield). It is in the Arctic that the 
problem works itself out, the girl and her two 
suitors there finding themselves confronted with 
starvation. The girl's favorite of the two men had 
been opposed by her family ; the family's favorite 
proves lacking in that elemental thing known in 
civilization as honor. The point of the story 
the old difference between man's intelligence and 
woman's intuition is only reached on the last 
page. The story is a good one, vividly told. 

In " Maria Again," Mrs. John Lane continues 
that acute criticism of English life among the 
upper middle class which she began in "According 
to Maria." It is the lightest of froth, on the 
surface, where froth is usually found ; and what 
Maria has to say is largely drivel. But the froth 
indicates the vapidity beneath, and the drivel is a 
sincere expression of what that sort of woman 
thinks and says. The book is really a poignant 
satire, and those who believe that something is the 
matter with England at the present crisis can 
make good use of Mrs. Lane's material in diag- 
nosing the evils. (John Lane Co.) 

Mr. J. E. Le Rossignol has written an unusual 
book in "Jean Baptiste " (Dutton). With large 
powers of imagination, he is never satisfied with 
allowing the conventional to control the actions of 
his characters, and the jaded reader may find many 
a surprise awaiting him in consequence. Again 
and again, where a less skilful writer would have 
been satisfied to allow the narrative to pursue its 
customary course, temperament overrules and the 
story takes another and unexpected slant. Dealing 
with the Canadian habitant, the result justifies the 
method; one feels that one has met real persons, 
and not the mere types of more ordinary novels. 

A young and popular novelist hears it said that 
all his success was due to his first book, of which 
his others are merely variants. He forgoes his 
great prosperity, meets and marries a humble 
French girl, whom he takes to Paris. There, liv- 
ing in abject poverty, he writes another novel 
pseudonymously, and achieves another success.

This is the frame about which Mr. Robert W. 
Service writes "The Pretender" (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.), which is nothing if not amusing. There is 
more than a spice of Boheme about it, and much 
of the joy of youth and irresponsibility. 

A book most happily entitled is Miss Helen 
Mackay's "Accidentals" (Duffield). It is not a 
novel, it is hardly fiction at all. Episode after 
episode of life in Paris, seen with keenly sympa- 
thetic vision, make up its contents, the longest of 
these episodes filling only a few pages. Fully fin- 
ished as each of them is and quite complete in 
itself, they collectively constitute the raw material 
of literature rather than literature itself, many of 
them being suggestions from which novelist and 
dramatist might profit. 



BRIEFS ON ]STB\v BOOKS. 



" Manifestations of Economic 
welfare work in Liberalism" would have been a 

modern industry. -in 

better title for the last book of 
the much regretted Charles R. Henderson 
than the rather cryptic one that it bears- 
" Citizens in Industry" (Appleton). The 
central purpose of the volume is to present a 
picture of the welfare work done by capital- 
istic establishments for their employees the 
world over. It touches descriptively also 
upon those general social movements for the 
betterment of the laboring masses which such 
establishments are assisting, but which they 
do not control. The justification of the title 
lies in Professor Henderson's doctrine that 
all economic movements for the betterment of 
the worker, mentally, physically, and morally, 
must be founded on a conception of the 
democratic solidarity of modern society. In 
their programmes for the socialization of in- 
dustry, organizers and reformers must realize 
that a feudal, patriarchal, patronizing atti- 
tude on the part of capital is unacceptable ; 
that our workmen demand of their employers 
and the State recognition of their legal and 
political equality, and of their rights to the 
cultural fruits of social organization. Em- 
ployers and employed are common "citizens 
in industry." The book is a compilation 
which draws on all the principal American 
and European sources of information, and 
which combines wide knowledge with an excel- 
lent organization. There are chapters on 
hygiene and safety in the factory and shop; j 
on the improvement of the home life of em- 
ployees, from special homes for working boys 
and girls to wide civic housing schemes; on 
the moral and religious influence of churches, 
Christian Associations, and libraries; and on 
the training and work of welfare secretaries 
in large establishments. Happily, no fear of 
unduly advertising large American and 



European business houses has prevented the 
author from filling these chapters with con- 
crete illustrations. Two larger subjects, 
" Education and Culture " and " Experiments 
in Industrial Democracy," are naturally 
treated with less thoroughness. In connection 
with the first, Professor Henderson says an elo- 
quent and much-needed word against the plan 
for vocational education which would place 
industry alone in control of this part of the 
public school system, and thus give us a dual 
school organization, creating fixed classes of 
the liberally and the technically trained. But 
he makes only slight allusion to certain move- 
ments in modern education that promise a 
far-reaching effect on industry. In connection 
with the second subject, Professor Henderson 
has to say something upon the representation 
of the worker in shop management, upon his 
voluntary participation in welfare plans, 
upon profit-sharing, upon recent theories of 
economic wages, and upon plans for arbitra- 
tion and conciliation. It is little disparage- 
ment to state that his attempt to cover salient 
recent developments in these fields is unsatis- 
factory. He should have neutralized his 
limitations of space by a more frank recourse 
to generalization, especially as his illustra- 
tions omit much that will disappoint the 
careful reader, any mention under con- 
ciliation, for example, of the protocol in the 
garment trades of New York, Philadelphia, 
and Boston. But the book as a whole is such 
a conspectus of a complex field as we have 
long needed. It is filled, moreover, with an 
optimism, a faith in meliorism under the 
present trend of the economic system, that 
must impress those who were acquainted with 
Professor Henderson's farsightedness. 



French faith 



Two little books recently trans- 
lated bring confirmation of 
he great war. French earnestness and devo- 
tion in the present struggle. The first is a 
letter by M. Paul Sabatier, a distinguished 
writer on religious themes. It is entitled 
"The Ideals of France" (London: T. Fisher 
Unwin), and was written in response to a 
peace resolution passed by the International 
Society for Franciscan Studies at Assisi. The 
Allies, he says, are fighting for an ideal. To 
think of peace before the goal is reached 
would be an abdication, Dante's, gran 
rifiuto. Hence, though grateful to w r ould-be 
peace-makers for the excellence of their in- 
tentions, " we are somewhat embarrassed by 
the thought that they are more careful of 
our physical than of our moral life." Not 
" peace at any price " but that " righteous- 
ness and peace " preached by Saint Francis 



278

[ Sept. 30 



is the goal, and France is determined to strug- 
gle to the end against a " Kultur which is 
naught save worship of the sword and of the 
golden calf." The second book, Mme. M. 
Eydoux-Demians's "In a French Hospital" 
(Duffield), gives ample evidence that this 
ideal is backed by the heroism necessary for 
its accomplishment. These notes of a nurse 
in the hospital of Saint Dominic illustrate the 
willing offer by the soldiers of suffering and 
of life in the great cause, as well as the devo- 
tion of their families and nurses. The book 
is filled with anecdotes revealing the entire 
forgetfulness of self for the path of duty. 
Touching is the affection of the soldiers for 
each other and for their officers, and the offi- 
cers' praise of their men. All are conscious 
that they are doing their part for France, and 
that is the only thing that matters. This 
testament of a single line, found by a father 
on his son's body, is characteristic of them 
all : " If we are victorious, I beg my parents 
not to put on mourning for me." Nor is 
humor lacking, it never is in France, even 
in the midst of so much ghastliness. " The 
joy of the spirit gives the measure of its 
strength," wrote Ninon with a profound in- 
sight into French character. Written by a 
devout Catholic in a hospital under the man- 
agement of the Sisters of Saint Vincent de 
Paul, it is natural that the author should give 
full expression to her religious feeling. One 
hesitates to criticize, surely any ideal con- 
solation that the troubled hearts of France 
can find to-day is worthy; and yet one feels 
that this insistent sentimental reaction is a 
bit intrusive. The translator's work is not all 
that could be desired. The reader is fre- 
quently and unpleasantly reminded that the 
work is a translation, too hastily done. 



. , Mr. Clarence Hawkes tells with 

memories of a 

blind poet f rankness and modesty the story 

and naturalist. Qf hig her()ic jj fe j n ft gmall VQ[ _ 

ume entitled " Hitting the Dark Trail " 
(Holt). "Starshine through Thirty Years 
of Night" is the poetic sub-title. Blanco 
White's famous sonnet may have suggested 
this secondary title and also prompted the 
utterance : " The sun at noontide showed me 
the world and all its wonders, but the night 
has shown me the universe, the countless stars 
and illimitable space, the vastness and the 
wonder of all life. The perfect day showed 
me man's world, but the night showed me 
God's universe." In telling the pathetic story 
of his blindness the author does not note the 
striking similarity of his case to that of Henry 
Fawcett. A hunting excursion with a sport- 
loving father, a shotgun in the careless hands 



of that father, and the damage was done, 
leaving in each instance a flickering remnant 
of eyesight and a faint hope of ultimate re- 
covery, a hope destined in both cases to final 
disappointment after surgical skill had done 
its utmost. But while we know that Faw- 
cett's father made agonized endeavors to 
atone for his carelessness, we learn nothing 
of the elder Hawkes's conduct or frame of 
mind after that fatal day. The mother, how- 
ever, did all that a mother could do for a 
stricken child. Tragic also, though in a less 
degree, is the account of the writer's earlier 
loss of a leg. If ever a high-spirited youth 
entered on the struggle of life under serious 
handicaps, that youth was Clarence Hawkes, 
and the story of the struggle is to be reckoned 
a memorable piece of autobiography. Ex- 
pressing his disability in mathematical terms, 
Mr. Hawkes says : " I am confident that 
blindness is a twenty-five per cent handicap 
in the work of life, no matter what profession 
you adopt. The blind person, in order to suc- 
ceed equally with the seeing, must put in one 
hundred and twenty-five per cent of energy 
before he can stand abreast of his seeing com- 
petitor." More than that; for if he begins 
with only three-quarters of the normal equip- 
ment, the extra expenditure of energy to 
bring the total up to that normal will ob- 
viously be one third, not one quarter. The 
author's style is so good that one cannot but 
wish he had more carefully observed the nice- 
ties of "shall" and "should," which, it is 
true, hardly anyone does now observe, the 
more's the pity. Excellent illustrations by 
Mr. Charles Copeland and from photographs 
accompany the reading matter. 



Mr. Wells'* Mr - H " G ' ^ells ls ^ ftl1 O(Ws 

"holiday in the most original and untram- 
book-making." melled book-maker in the world 

to-day. " Boon : The Mind of the Eace, The 
Wild Asses of the Devil and The Last Trump, 
by Reginald Bliss, author of ' Whales in Cap- 
tivity/ with an ambiguous introduction by 
H. G. Wells," all sounds engaging enough; 
but the book itself repays even more than the 
title promises. Although copyrighted in the 
name of Reginald Bliss, it is altogether im- 
probable that the author wished or hoped to 
evade publicity, even though he might be 
willing to escape some of the responsibility. 
The style, the ideas, even the description of 
the dumpy figure of Boon so like Mr. Wells's 
description elsewhere of himself, all hint 
plainly that he had really no intention of 
concealing himself. But being what it is, the 
book is more engaging than if it were what it 
pretends to be. The publishers (George H. 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



279 



Doran Co.) speak of it as "a joyous holiday 
in book-making." As far as plan is concerned, 
this description is accurate; for it seems at 
first that the author is deliberately turning 
away from the gloom and strain of war to let 
his fancy cavort at will for the pleasure of an 
anxious and over-taxed reading public, to 
"gyre and gimble in the wabe." If so, he 
soon forgets his purpose; or, what is more 
probable, he was not really throwing out a 
tale of a tub any more than Swift was when 
by pretending to turn away from politics and 
the Church he focussed attention on them. 
Mr. Wells has things to say about the present 
times, vague, inchoate, ambiguous things in 
part; and being the literary craftsman that 
he is, he invents a delightful, indirect, effec- 
tive way of saying them. Of course he pokes 
fun at America (under the pseudonym of 
"Aunt Dove ") , the " Encyclopaedia Britan- 
nica," Aristotle, "The Nation," Mr. Henry 
James, and all manner of lesser things and 
men. But this is only rhetorical padding. 
Boon; the putative author Bliss; Dodd the 
Rationalist who was obsessed with the fear 
that some one might smuggle God back into 
the universe under some other name; Hal- 
lery, the hero of Boon's projected book; and 
Wilkins, the literary opponent of Boon, and 
the little author of Folkstone, all these are 
merely so many phases of the mind of Mr. 
Wells. He is using Carlyle's classical fiction 
of employing straw men to foist his doubtful, 
unsettled, or inconclusive theories upon. 
What he wants to say, and does say with 
much poetic power and engaging naivete, is 
this: The race of men is inevitably though 
slowly developing a unit consciousness, a col- 
lective wisdom; but meanwhile the Wild 
Asses of the Devil, who get into all manner 
of high places and cannot be detected and 
distinguished from real men, are paying their 
Master by cutting up the most asinine tricks, 
getting the world into the present war for 
instance, and creating the effect of utter riot 
and decay; and last most pathetic thing, 
even when the Last Trump inadvertently 
sounds a truncated note of warning and God 
becomes actual and visible, men will not per- 
mit themselves to believe that it is really God, 
though they may wish and pray half-heart- 
edly for the very sign they are at the moment 
receiving. 

Decorating and Evei T intelligent devotee of 
furnishing the home-making is glad to avail 
ment - himself of helpful books or pic- 
tures on this subject. And as a very large 
proportion of homes are now made in apart- 
ments, instead of in separate houses, such a 



book as Mr. B. Russell Herts's " The Decora- 
tion and Furnishing of Apartments" (Put- 
nam) is especially welcome. In it, the author 
calls attention to the fact that all the vast 
changes in methods of living, the bringing 
together of continents by means of fast steam- 
ers, cables, airships, and the telegraph; the 
advancement of the sciences; the growing 
ease of manufacture, all these have not re- 
sulted in a new style of architecture or decora- 
tion. American art, like American thought, 
being conservative, the antique has been cop- 
ied with avidity; but that "period" rooms, 
however good, or an eternal copying of former 
styles, are the best of which we to-day are 
capable, cannot be granted. The outlook is 
distinctly encouraging, as we may see by look- 
ing back some forty years, when taste in 
America was at its lowest. The vagaries of 
the 1875 designers had nothing to do with any 
new art; whereas in the art movements of 
to-day, whether we approve of them or not, 
we recognize the mature and concerted action 
of talented artists. Their messages converge 
to one essential point, the necessity of free- 
dom and simplicity. To establish certain 
canons of this nature, to urge that apartments 
shall be furnished in a manner at once effec- 
tive, satisfying, and sincere, is the purpose 
of Part I. of Mr. Herts's book, occupying 
about one-fourth of the total space. Part II. 
is devoted to the practical details, which are 
discussed in an intimate and informal fash- 
ion. Separate chapters are given to each type 
of apartment, from the smallest, consisting 
of only two rooms, with "kitchenette" and 
bath, to the sumptuous spaces of the " duplex." 
In dealing with large apartments, the author 
faces the danger of over-sumptuousness, and 
the difficulties too often experienced by Amer- 
icans of "becoming extravagant gracefully." 
The very important considerations of "Win- 
dows and their Curtaining," " Control of Arti- 
ficial Light," " Bric-a-Brac and Pictures " are 
not only described in detail, but illustrated 
by beautiful colored plates accompanied by 
descriptive notes. These plates alone form a 
liberal education for the amateur. Although 
in a field where personal taste counts for so 
much the reader may discover many points 
for his own dissent, he can hardly fail to find 
the book suggestive as well as entertaining.

development of social legislation, the impor- 
tant activities of the judiciary, all receive 
fresh and illuminating treatment. It is 
mainly, however, because of the point of view 
of the author with respect to the executive 
organs of national and state government that 
the work merits special notice. Mr. Young 
believes in executive leadership, its fitness in 
a scheme of democracy, its capacity for ser- 
vice, and its responsiveness to sound public 
opinion. He accepts executive leadership in 
American government as a distinct advance 
rather than as a dangerous usurpation. In 
doing so, and in effectively presenting this 
view, the author has made a real contribution 
to the cause of good government in the United 
States. The chief regret of the student after 
a perusal of the book is that some adequate 
attention could not have been given to local 
government, especially city government, as a 
part of the American system. Local govern- 
ment in the United States has suffered not a 
little from the fact that its relative impor- 
tance in the American system has not been 
sufficiently noticed in the existing books deal- 
ing with American government. In no other 
department of this subject has the devel- 
opment of executive leadership been more 
conspicuous than in municipal government. 
This omission, however, will not prevent Mr. 
Young's volume from serving a useful pur- 
pose. Its merits will be generally recognized 
and appreciated. Its frankly modern view- 
point will attract and interest the student. 
There will be a difference of opinion as to 
whether the amount of constitutional mate- 
rial introduced in the form of judicial opin- 
ions and interpretations does not exceed the 
assimilative capacity of the average college 
and university student of first and second 
year standing. Power of clear and forceful 
statement are present, however, to aid in the 
presentation of this material. Besides, the 
average student needs a little strong meat in 
his intellectual diet. 



A resume of 
the Chinese 
Revolution. 



Now that the days of the Re- 
public of China seem limited, 
and the monarchy is about to be 
re-established, it would be difficult to find a 
more satisfactory review of the Revolution 
which gave rise to the Republic and of the 
significant events of the Revolution that ren- 
der the impending reversion apparently fore- 
ordained and inevitable, than one finds in 
"The Remaking of China" (Button). Mr. 
Adolf F. Waley, the author, modestly dis- 
claims competition with recent major works 
dealing with the same subject, but he gives 
evidence of "very close study . . bestowed upon 



the problems . . which the recent changes in 
that country have brought into prominence." 
So close has been this study and so true the 
author's discernment that the daily press is 
now bringing us news of the fulfilment of 
prognostications contained in this brief treat- 
ise. Beginning with the period of the minor- 
ity of the Emperor Kwang-hsu in the middle 
of the last century, a time of stagnation and 
decay in China, the author narrates concisely 
but in considerable detail events leading to 
the establishment of the Republic, the plant- 
ing of seeds of new thought in the mind 
of the young Emperor by Kang Yu Wei, the 
sudden and extreme reform edicts of the con- 
verted monarch, the resumption of authority 
by the Empress Dowager and the crushing of 
the reform party, the brief terror of the 
Boxer uprising and the ensuing conversion 
of the Empress Dowager to a programme of 
reform, the death of the Emperor and the 
Empress Dowager, the futile reactionary pol- 
icy of the Regent, and the outbreaking and 
swift success of the Revolution. Events of 
the Revolution which were significant of 
future tendencies are carefully narrated and 
discussed. The character of Yuan Shi Kai is 
criticized with impartial appreciation and 
condemnation of its good and its bad traits. 
Suggestions are offered as to the probable 
developments of the near future. These sug- 
gestions are in part being realized at the 
present time. The little volume is therefore 
not only an excellent handbook of the Revolu- 
tion, but also a guide to the observer of pres- 
ent movements in China. 



The home Dr - ^J h i ur E " B O S t W i C k's 

library's larger thoughtful essays on library 
matters, originally contributed 
to " The Bookman," are now gathered into a 
book under the title, " The Making of an 
American's Library" (Little, Brown & Co.). 
As indicated by their headings, the five chap- 
ters treat successively of books as room-mates, 
the art of browsing, the library as a literary 
laboratory, the boy and the book, and re- 
cuperative bibliophily. Primarily it is from 
the book-buyer's standpoint that the public 
library is considered in these chapters. He 
who would form a collection of his own is 
counselled not to buy on the recommendation 
of others, but to ascertain and develop his 
tastes by a copious yet discriminating use of 
the public library. Far from superfluous is 
th"e caution against buying sets and complete 
works. Not even the greatest authors should 
be exempt from the weeding-out process : and 
still more are many of the arbitrarily formed 
series or " libraries." sold often through glib-

tongued agents, to be viewed with suspicion. 
Amazing is it to observe, even now, how 
largely the libraries of the uninformed, the 
careless buyers, are made up of this sort of 
lumber, which hardly anyone ever pretends 
to read. Wooden dummies would be far 
cheaper and could be painted to look just as 
showy. In one passage the author laments 
the failure of public libraries to secure from 
book-dealers " special consideration in the 
way of discount." But surely the consideration 
they do receive is not ungenerous ; it is much 
more, as a rule, than the dealer is justified in 
granting. With all the risks and uncertain- 
ties it has to face, the book-trade is not likely 
to make many millionaires. Excellent and 
rather novel in its form is Dr. Bostwick's 
paragraph on the individuality and charm of 
the printed word, a charm which, as he notes 
with regret, the spelling-reformer is trying 
to impair. His concluding chapter considers 
the unrealized possibilities of usefulness in 
the cooperation of public and private libra- 
ries. Though called " The Making of an 
American's Library," the book should have 
meaning and value to readers and library- 
formers of any nationality. 



An enemy's When thfi citiz611 f 

estimate of the ent country attempts to set 
down the national psychology 
of an enemy the result is almost sure to be 
unjustifiable disparagement. Mr. Thomas 
F. A. Smith, an Englishman who lived for 
twelve years in Germany and claims to know 
the country and its people thoroughly, vents 
himself in the following vein in his book 
called "The Soul of Germany" (Doran) : 
" In summing up, Germans are characterized 
by unbounded vanity, love of secrecy, morbid 
sensitiveness, envy, absence of consideration 
for others, a strong tendency to revert to ' the 
ape and tiger'; Germans lack true sentiment 
and affection, but have a remarkable inclina- 
tion to reckless, brutal self-assertion." The 
only virtues which the author thinks may be 
unreservedly ascribed to them are obedience 
and thrift. One wonders if, for example, the 
honesty of the German lower and middle 
classes counts for nothing, or if the wide- 
spread love of music and poetry does not indi- 
cate certain finer susceptibilities. Mr. Smith 
seems to place the blame for the deterioration 
of the German character on militarism and 
Social Democracy, although it must be evi- 
dent that these two forces counteract each 
other in certain important respects. One 
point in his invective may be granted: envy 
seems to be the most characteristic vice of the 
Germans, we have the authority of two 



chancellors of the German Empire, Bismarck 
and Biilow, for this generalization. The re- 
viewer, who has spent several years in Ger- 
many, can also endorse the author's statement 
that inveterate hatred of England was to be 
encountered among all classes long before the 
war, mixed with the hope that the day would 
come when England should be broken and 
humiliated. Perhaps envy and hatred stand 
here in the relation of cause and effect. An 
appendix gives some interesting statistics to 
show that crimes of violence and lust are 
much more frequent in "law-abiding" Ger- 
many than in England. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" The Alligator and Its Allies" (Putnam) is the 
title of a somewhat elaborate scientific work by 
Professor A. M. Reese, who has hunted this giant 
reptile in the swamps of Florida and Georgia for 
the Smithsonian Institution at Washington. The 
work gives an account of distribution, habits, and 
commercial uses of the American alligator and 
crocodile, and a brief statement of the characteris- 
tics and distribution of the old-world relatives of 
these giant reptiles. Much of the book is devoted 
to a technical account of the anatomy and develop- 
ment of the alligator, which will be useful in the 
anatomical and embryological laboratories in which 
advanced instruction is given. There are abun- 
dant illustrations, an extensive bibliography, and 
a good index. 

Mr. Axel Moth, of the New York Public 
Library, turns to account his long experience as 
cataloguer in a useful handbook on " Technical 
Terms Used in Bibliographies and by the Book 
and Printing Trades," which he further designates 
as a supplement to Mr. Frank K. Walter's earlier 
similar work. Terms found in Mr. Walter's book 
are, with a few exceptions, omitted by Mr. Moth. 
The arrangement is alphabetical, in nine lists rep- 
resenting as many languages, English, Danish, 
Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin (compiled 
by Mr. Walter), Spanish, and Swedish. A few 
puzzling omissions and irregularities, not attribu- 
table to the supplementary nature of the book, 
invite remark. While the English list gives 
equivalent terms in the other modern languages 
named, these equivalents are sometimes lacking, 
without apparent reason, in one or more of the 
foreign lists. Rather conspicuous, too, is the acci- 
dental omission of " German " in the second entry 
of the table of contents. Among the few defini- 
tions in the English list occurs an explanation of 
" signature " which fails to note the derived and 
more customary meaning of the term as a folded 
sheet, not merely the mark at the foot of its first 
page. A larger measure of comprehensiveness in 
its not very extensive field, with no attempt to 
make the book supplementary to an earlier one, 
would have rendered Mr. Moth's scholarly manual 
more thoroughly useful and satisfactory. It is 
published by the Boston Book Co.

NOTES. 



We learn that a volume of collected prose by 
the Irish writer "A. E." (Mr. George Russell) is 
ready for immediate publication. 

A volume of verses for children by Mr. James 
Stephens is soon to appear under the title, " The 
Adventures of Seumas Beg: The Rocky Road to 
Dublin." 

Mr. Temple Thurston has recently completed a 
new romance entitled " The Passionate Crime : A 
Tale of Faerie," which will appear during the 
autumn. 

The book rights for Miss Geraldine Farrar's 
autobiography have been secured by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co., and the volume will be published dur- 
ing the winter. 

Mr. John G. Neihardt writes of the adventurous 
life of Canadian pioneers in a volume of verse, 
" The Song of Hugh Glass," which Messrs. Mac- 
millan will soon issue. 

In "War, Progress, and the End of History," 
by Vladimir Soloviev, the author attempts a de- 
fence of war as a means of progress. Messrs. 
Doran will publish the book. 

A new and greatly enlarged edition of Sir Sid- 
ney Lee's " Life of Shakespeare " will appear dur- 
ing the autumn. The same writer's authorized 
" Life of King Edward VII." is also nearly ready 
for publication. 

" Six Portraits of Rabindranath Tagore " made 
by the English artist Mr. Will Rotbenstein are 
shortly to be published by Messrs. Macmillan. A 
prefatory note to the book is contributed by Mr. 
Max Beerbohm. 

Sir Martin Conway will shortly publish through 
Messrs. Longmans a book on " The Crowd in Peace 
and War." It is an attempt to deal in popular 
language with the relations of the individual to 
the crowd and of crowds to one another. 

" Indian Memories " is the title of Sir Robert 
Baden-Powell's new book, which will be issued 
during the autumn. The author has illustrated his 
impressions with sketches in color and in black 
and white. 

Three new " Bohn " volumes soon to appear are 
" The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley," edited in 
two volumes by Mr. Roger Ingpen, and Ranke's 
" History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations, 
1494-1514." 

A satire on war, probing the militarist philoso- 
phy, has been written by Vernon Lee under the 
title of " The Ballet of the Nations," and will be 
published with decorations by Maxwell Armfield. 
The volume will be issued immediately by Messrs. 
Putnam. 

Mr. Stephen Graham, who is rapidly making a 
reputation for himself with his books on Russia 
and the Russians, has still another volume in press 
for early issue, to be entitled " The Way of Martha 
and the Way of Mary." It is a study of life and 
religion in Russia. 

" National Floodmarks " is the title of a forth- 
coming volume composed of the most striking edi- 



torials that have appeared in " Collier's Weekly " 
which its editor, Mr. Mark Sullivan, has prepared 
in celebration of the twentieth birthday of the 
magazine. The book will be published by Messrs. 
Doran. 

A new volume of poems, " Rivers to the Sea," 
by Miss Sara Teasdale, is immediately forthcom- 
ing from the press of the. Macmillan Co. Most of 
the poems have had earlier magazine publication; 
they have also been translated into German by 
Mr. Rudolf Rieder to be published in Munich at 
the close of the war. 

"A Reverie of Childhood and Youth," by Mr. 
William Butler Yeats, is one of the recent an- 
nouncements of Messrs. Macmillan. The volume is 
described as a spiritual and emotional biography 
of Yeats's early years, written in charming prose 
with the interest inevitably attached to the account 
of a sensitive childhood. 

The first volumes of a " Vassar College Seini- 
Centennial Series " will comprise " Brissot de War- 
ville " by Miss Eloise Ellery ; " Elizabethan 
Translations from the Italian" by Dr. Mary 
Augusta Scott; " Social Studies in English Lit- 
erature '' by Miss Laura J. Wylie; and "An In- 
troduction to the Study of Variable Stars" by 
Miss Caroline E. Furness. 

In addition to the new translations of Bjornson's 
" Poems and Songs " and Strindberg's " Master 
Olof " just issued in the series of " Scandinavian 
Classics," the American-Scandinavian Foundation 
has in press for November publication an exhaus- 
tive monograph on " Ballad Criticism in Scandi- 
navia and Great Britain during the 18th Century," 
prepared by Mr. Sigurd Bernhard Hustvedt, of the 
University of Illinois. 

Mr. Hall Caine's series of newspaper articles on 
the war will shortly be issued in book form by 
Messrs. Lippincott under the title of " The Drama 
of 365 Days." In it are gathered many recollec- 
tions of famous actors in recent European history, 
studies in national psychology, based upon per- 
sonal observation and travel before the war and 
since, with anecdotes that throw light upon men 
and motives in recent times. 

The three volumes of " The Literary Diary of 
Ezra Stiles, D.D., LL.D.," edited by Mr. Franklin 
Bowditch Dexter, M.A., have been taken over for 
publication under the imprint of the Yale Uni- 
versity Press. In bequeathing his manuscripts to 
his successor in the presidency of Yale College, 
Ezra Stiles probably did not realize that his diary 
would be recognized as an historical record and 
be the one among his writings to live long years 
after the other pages had been forgotten. 

A new volume of essays by Mr. Arthur Symons, 
entitled " Figures of Several Centuries," will be 
an important feature of the autumn publishing 
season. The studies include " George Meredith as 
a Poet," "A Note on the Genius of Thomas 
Hardy," " St. Augustine," " Charles Lamb," " Gus- 
tave Flaubert," "Algernon Charles Swinburne," 
" Dante Gabriel Rossetti," " Henrik Ibsen," " Wal- 
ter Pater," " Coventry Patmore," "Aubrey Beards- 
ley," " Sarojini Naidu," and " Welsh Poetry."

"A Book of Victorian Poetry and Prose," com- 
piled by Mrs. Hugh Walker, is announced by 
Messrs. Putnam, in conjunction with the Cambridge 
University Press. The contents are classified un- 
der such headings as " Systematic Thinkers," 
" Biography and Criticism," " Poetry," " Novel- 
ists," and " History." The volume also serves to 
illustrate the criticisms offered upon this period in 
the " Outlines of Victorian Literature," in which 
the compiler collaborated with her husband, Pro- 
fessor Hugh Walker. 

The autumn announcement list of Mr. Blackwell 
of Oxford includes the following titles : " Life of 
Viscount Bolingbroke," by Arthur Hassall; "Tales 
by Polish Authors," translated by Else C. M. 
Benecke; " Still More Russian Picture Tales," by 
Valery Carrick, translated by Nevill Forbes; "An 
American Garland: Being a Collection of Ballads 
Relating to America, 1563-1759," edited with 
introduction and notes by C. H. Firth ; " Oxford 
Poetry, 1915," edited by G. D. H. C. and T. W. E.; 
" The War and Religion," by Alfred Loisy, trans- 
lated by Arthur Galton ; " Syria as a Roman 
Province," by E. S. Bouchier; "Analysis of Mill's 
Principles of Political Economy," by L. Older- 
shaw ; " Historical Geography of England," by 
Maud Holliday ; and " Symphonies : Poems on the 
Four Movement Plan," by E. H. W. M. 

Martin Luther d'Ooge, one of the best-known of 
American classical scholars, died suddenly at Ann 
Arbor, Michigan, on the 12th inst. Born in Zon- 
nemaire, Netherlands, in 1839, he came to this 
country at an early age, and was educated at the 
University of Michigan. Later he went abroad, 
and studied at the University of Leipzig. He 
joined the teaching staff of the University of 
Michigan in 1867, and from 1870 to 1912 was pro- 
fessor of Greek in that institution. Professor 
d'Ooge took an active part in the work of the 
American School of Classical Studies in Athens, 
the American Philological Association, and the 
American Archaeological Institute. He is the 
author of a volume on " The Acropolis of Athens," 
and the editor of several standard classical texts. 
His periodical contributions include a number of 
reviews prepared for THE DIAL. 

A translation, in seven volumes, of " L'Hisfoire 
de France Racontee a Tous," of which M. Franz 
Funck-Brentano is the general editor, is announced 
by an English publisher, under the title of " The 
National History of France." Its aim is to pre- 
sent the history of each epoch, its men, its events, 
the movement of ideas and social life, of art and 
letters, in a volume of moderate compass and in 
an easy style, with no parade of learning, but 
solidly based on research. Up to the present, four 
volumes have been published in the original 
French "The Renaissance," by M. Louis Batiffol, 
" The Great Century," by M. Jacques Boulenger, 
"The Eighteenth Century," by M. Casimir Stryien- 
ski, and " The Revolution," by M. Louis Madelin 
and of these, three have been " crowned " by the 
Academy. M. Batiffol's " The Renaissance," the 
first volume of the series which has been trans- 
lated into English, will be published during the 
present season.

HEART OF EUROPE 

By RALPH ADAMS CRAM 

Nothing could be a more timely or valuable contribution to the knowledge of what the great war 
means than this book. The description of the cities like Liege, Louvain, Malines, Rheims, Laon, Soissons, 
and Namur, which have been victims; of Amiens, of Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, and Brussels, which have 
been endangered, is eloquent far beyond the mere marshalling of facts and pictures; it is not possible to 
read it without a thrill of deepest sympathy with Mr. Cram's love of what he describes and his sense of 
its loss or peril. 32 illustrations and photogravure frontispiece. $2.50 net.

A Protest Against the New Tyranny 

WHICH IS NOT THE NEARLY OBSOLETE DESPOTISM OF 
ONE MAN OVER THE PEOPLE BUT THE NEWER DESPOTISM 

of Overzealous and Indiscriminate Popular Legislation 

OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN 

The dangers to America from this new tyranny have been ably pointed out in the August 
FORUM by Mr. Truxtun Beale, the eminent publicist and donor to education. In this con- 
tribution he shows how applicable to our present-day conditions are the remarkable essays by 
Herbert Spencer published in England fifty years ago under the title THE MAN vs. THE 
STATE. THE FORUM will republish eight of these essays serially, each chapter to be 
accompanied by expository articles on its present-day significance, these articles being specially 
written by the most eminent American authorities. Beginning in the September FORUM 
with Senator Root's article, the chapters with their expository contributors are as follows:

A WORD ON "THE GENTEEL CRITIC." 

If of late years the critic has ever been weak 
enough to fancy that his homely slighted trade 
might be looking up a bit, that its processes 
might be a little less an object of suspicion 
and its product a little less an object of con- 
tempt, he has always been brought to his 
senses quickly enough. The ancient assump- 
tion that all critics are knaves or fools or 
both is, to be sure, no longer universally held. 
Some readers, some writers even, are now pre- 
pared to admit that Aristotle, however mis- 
taken, had his excuse for being ; that Matthew 
Arnold occasionally talked a kind of fussy 
sense; that Sainte-Beuve and Jules Lemaitre 
(ah, let us never forget that tag about souls 
and masterpieces ! ) were probably honest and 
possibly useful men. So, among persons of 
liberal mind, a place in the sun is granted to 
the plumber, the dentist, the undertaker. The 
critic is a rarer bird : and, for one thing, more 
easily dispensed with. One or two in a gen- 
eration quite satisfy the public demand. As 
for the rank and file, the Toms, Dicks, and 
Harrys of criticism, to name them in the 
same breath with the Toms, Dicks, and Harrys 
of authorship is merely absurd ! On the con- 
trary (says tradition), these fellows are, in the 
very act of criticism, self-confessed failures 
and parasites, doing their paltry lines for 
their miserable pennies, shooting their idle 
squibs, stuffing their men of straw, wielding 
their ugly and thugly bludgeons for gross (if 
minute) rewards and to no other purpose. 
Reviewers ? Bless us ! There is no such thing 
as criticism of the contemporary, anyhow. 
A fellow just talks ! 

These painful considerations have been 
brought home to me afresh by certain lively 
utterances of that genuine, story-teller and 
honest hater of shams, Mr. Owen Wister. In his 
recent "Atlantic Monthly " paper on " Quack 
Novels and Democracy," he hangs, draws, and 
quarters the fiction of the populace,, of " our 
American hordes, who have learned to read 
without profit to themselves but with such 
huge profit to quack-novelists and publishers." 
You observe he assumes a firmly critical stance 
at the outset. A plain blunt man with no 



304 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 14 



aesthetic theory might perhaps maintain that 
the profit our American hordes derive from 
their quack novels, and plays, and " movies," 
and boluses, and religions, is certainly exis- 
tent, though not the kind of profit scored up 
by "highbrows." But of course no responsible 
critic could listen to him: he would be mak- 
ing nothing, or next to nothing, of the differ- 
ence between true art and sham art ; and this 
is exactly the point about which critics, Mr. 
Wister among them, have to be touchy. What 
Mr. Wister deplores is a muddled popular 
taste for which pretty much everybody 'but 
the populace itself is responsible. There is 
democracy, to begin with, which forces a little 
learning upon its hordes, and turns them loose 
with that dangerous instrument in their 
hands. And there are the novelists and pub- 
lishers who deliberately play upon the weak- 
ness of these hordes. 

Mr. Wister's awful example of quack fiction 
is the work of Mr. Harold Bell Wright. Not 
being among the five million readers of that 
author, I cannot judge the fairness of Mr. 
Wister's strictures, but am perfectly willing 
to take his word for it. I have read a dozen 
well-selling novels within a year as bad as, on 
the basis of Mr. Wister's amusing exhibits, 
Mr. Wright's appear to be. What particularly 
interests me is Mr. Wister's resentment of Mr. 
Wright, and the odd turn that resentment 
takes'. It is a critical, an aesthetic resentment 
turned, boomerang-fashion, against those 
who profess criticism. What he cannot bear is 
that so great a number of his fellow-citizens 
should be permitted to read the works of nov- 
elists like Mr. Harold Bell Wright as litera- 
ture. The plain blunt man "knows what he 
likes." That is all very well; but he ought 
not to be encouraged to think that what he 
likes is really, on that account, worth liking. 
Mr. Wister's complaint is that somebody is 
responsible for Mr. Wright and his millions 
and their muddled condition of mind and 
taste. There is Mr. Wright himself to begin 
with: he probably knows the commodity 
offered is a sham ; there is the publisher, who 
certainly knows it, but means to have the pub- 
lic think quite otherwise ; there are the news- 
papers which act as his tools ; finally, there is 
the " genteel critic." 

It is upon this last-named culprit that Mr. 
Wister unexpectedly and, as it were, inad- 
vertently centres his fire. The truth is, as 



readers of his prefaces may recall, he has a 
chronic scunner against reviewers ; put one in 
his way, and he drops everything for the fun 
of having a crack at the rascal. What he 
honestly intends to be interested in here is 
the Wright-reading public. "It is the read- 
ers, not the novels, I .am looking at," he 
declares. "My quotations are purely to help 
us get at the readers ; and I leave criticism to 
our native critics who find Mr. Wright like 
Dickens and Shakespeare." So far this is 
comfortable enough reading for critics who 
are incapable of "finding" anything of the 
sort. Alas, they are the last persons whose 
comfort Mr. Wister has in mind ; he is almost 
laughably in a hurry to make that clear. 
"Lest certain genteel critics who think they 
practice more discrimination than this, feel 
slighted, it may be well to explain here why 
they have so little influence. . . They do, 
tepidly, discriminate ; they do, after the fact, 
perceive and praise merit. They all the 
New York Times, the New York Sun, the 
Boston Evening Transcript, the New York 
Evening Post (very typical, this last one), 
with others of less note, stand ready ever to 
be the first to hail a perfectly well established 
artist." 

Now this is specific; this puts us where we 
belong, and pins us quivering there. The 
italics are Mr. Wister's; and here is, as it 
were, the lethal shaft : " Until the subsidized 
press is broken to pieces, and the genteel critic 
gathers heart, not only to brand the bad but 
to report and celebrate the good, I doubt if 
there will exist any word too contemptuous 
for American criticism." 

As for Mr. Wister's first clause, there is no 
room for disagreement : down with the venal 
puffery of a subsidized press! And down 
with the American publishers who strive to 
stultify the public taste by manipulation of 
" reading notices " and the like, as well as 
(this is the red rag to me personally) by their 
working assumption that one critic is as good 
as another or rather that the best critic is 
the one who shuts his eyes and slavers the 
proffered bone. Whatever the publisher may 
think of genteel critics, one cannot doubt his 
private opinion of the press driveller. Yet it

Shakespeare, for example, without a mo- 
ment's consideration of its source. Here, gen- 
teel critics must admit, is evidence that their 
influence upon the general public may be 
sadly small. Mr. Wister at least takes them 
seriously enough to demand that they shall 
mean something or other. He plainly sug- 
gests that the bathos of our criticism is largely 
responsible for the bathos of our popular lit- 
erature; and that if the critics were really 
worth their salt, they might be able to do 
something for our American hordes. Alas, 
the publishers are too clearly in the right of 
it : Mr. Wright's public has never heard of 
Mr. Howells, though it has heard of Mr. 
Hearst. Moreover, it thinks one fellow's opin- 
ion as good as another's: hence the efficacy 
for quotation of the soft-soapy lather stirred 
by some care-free underling on " The Spoon 
River Phenix." For the audience Mr. Wister 
is conning through his little window, the gen- 
teel critic does not exist. 

The genteel critic is probably just as sorry 
for that as Mr. Wister can be, and yet may 
not quite see that he ought on that ground to 
be counted out as a hypocrite or a poltroon. 
He may well wonder where Mr. Wister gets 
the impression that the best of our criticism 
of new fiction the best of our newspaper 
reviewing, let us say is either cowardly or 
backward in praise. I should think the best 
of our reviewers almost painfully ready to 
welcome signs of promise in a new writer 
to take chances, if need be, on the side of 
optimism. Not that it is part of the critic's 
business to " encourage " authors ; nothing is 
more irritating to an honest reviewer than to 
be thanked for praise. But it is certainly the 
highest and pleasantest part of his business 
to find good work and to advertise its good- 
ness. Why should he be timid or reluctant 
about it? As for the condition of things at 
present, it is hard to make out what Mr. 
Wister asks of us. He himself sadly pro- 
nounces that there are no new writers of high 
merit : " When an English novelist, who was 
lately in this country, asked four of us sitting 
at lunch, ' Who were the young ones ? ' we had 
to be silent." Doesn't the honest critic also 
have to be silent on that question? Or is he 
expected to produce writers of genius, as part 
of his job, like rabbits out of a hat ? 

Hardly less just, surely, is the obverse of 
this complaint; namely, that the best of our 



reviewers are content to lie down in the shade 
of known merit. I find them often, in default 
of other opportunity, taking up the work of 
" perfectly established artists," not to the end 
of solemnly ratifying a popular verdict, but 
to the end of verifying it if possible and, if 
not, of showing why it is false ; or of tracing 
the development or decadence of such an 
artist's work and registering its condition 
"to date"; or, it may be, of suggesting a 
right direction for future effort. The last- 
named possibility is, some one murmurs, 
fantastic, rather like teaching one's grand- 
mother to suck eggs. But there have been 
instances, even in America. Only the other 
day it happened that the fiction-critic of one 
of the publications on Mr. Wister's black-list 
of gentility was writing a little appreciation 
of a very popular story-teller, who happens 
to be on Mr. Wister's brief honor-roll of living 
American novelists who may be thought of 
without shame. The critic meant to make it 
a pretty careful study in small compass. He 
had a fairly clear impression of the kind of 
thing the novelist did and was capable of 
doing, and had read perhaps half his novels; 
but he wanted to confirm that impression, and 
therefore, as part of the day's work, read or 
reread a dozen volumes and found himself, in 
the process, surprisingly and enthrallingly 
converted to an altogether different view. It 
appeared, on the evidence of his work as a 
whole, that the novelist had all along been of 
two minds. His taste admired and pursued, 
let us say, realism, but his genius could not 
be diverted from romance : it was clear that he 
was in danger of choosing the wrong road in 
the end. Well, the critic had that little jump 
of pleasure which comes even to the galled 
jade when he finds a bit of succulence by 
the wayside. He put down his conclusions 
about the famous novelist without misgiving, 
being tolerably sure of his grounds. " It was 
his duty, and he did," but with the expecta- 
tion, if he thought of it, that his office would 
be taken as an ungracious if not impertinent 
one. Fancy a mere critic telling a successful 
Artist that he is wasting his time squinting 
the wrong way! Yet this artist promptly 
wrote a long letter thanking his critic, not for 
having been agreeable, but for having hit 
upon the truth,. "As to your conclusions," he 
said, " I believe you are just ; and your arti- 
cle reached me at an important moment."

Sweet and consoling hour for the homely 
slighted one! hour in which he once more 
assures himself, greatly daring (as the lady 
novelists say) that he may be not that figure 
of fun, the " genteel critic," but a man doing 
a man's work, not altogether in vain. 

As for the state of American fiction, of 
American art as a whole, doesn't it need to 
be looked upon with faith and with cheerful- 
ness? Must we (as Mr. Wister really appears 
to do) encourage ourselves to share that 
" certain condescension " with which the Mr. 
Edward Garnetts excusably (in view of 
their insularity) view us? Few questions 
have ever been determined by a monocular 
stare, or a contemptuous wave of the hand. 
We have our limitations, Heaven knows; 
but we are not altogether a peculiar paille 
in that respect. Certainly we shall not 
escape them by flying into a rage, or even 
by nagging each other. In the current 
number of the "Atlantic," another novelist- 
critic goes, smilingly, far deeper into the mat- 
ter than Mr. Wister (to whose outburst Mr. 
Nicholson alludes with good-humored depre- 
cation) has done. For the weaknesses of our 
fiction he blames not the public or publisher 
or reviewer, or outsider of any sort, but the 
novelists themselves. "When our writers 
cease their futile experimenting," he says, 
"and wake up to the possibilities of Amer- 
ican material, we shall have fewer complaints 
of the impotence of the American novel." 
Mr. Nicholson does not feel that we are alto- 
gether contemptible, in the meantime, and is 
sure that we are not to be helped by ill-humor 
or contempt. " The bright angels of letters," 
he concludes, "never appear in answer to 
prayer; they come out of nowhere and knock 
at unwatched gates. But the wailing of 
jeremiads before the high altar is not calcu- 
lated to soften the hearts of the gods who 
hand down genius from the skies." 



It is said. 



H. W. BOYNTON. 



THE LITERARY STAGNATION IN 
ENGLAND. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
If there be any truth and, personally, I 
doubt it in the theory that great wars pro- 
duce great literature, I incline to think that 
the explanation must be that wars are so 
supremely boring that the spirit of man, on 
emerging from them, leaps and dances in the 



sheer joy of escape. The tedium of the 
trenches has been recorded in the Marseillaise 
de nos jours: 

" Nobody knows how bored we are, 
Bored we are, bored we are, 
Nobody knows how bored we are, 
And nobody seems to care." 
But the tedium at home still awaits its song- 
ster. In a physical way, of course, England 
is active enough. She is pouring out men and 
munitions ; she means to win the war. But in 
the intellectual way she is completely stag- 
nant. It is impossible to think consecutively 
about Life, Art, Beauty, Truth, or any other 
such capital-lettered affair, with this vast pall 
hanging over one. Even when the war is not 
actually in one's mind, it is in the background. 
And if, with an effort, an artist throws off 
his torpor and tries to write about the war 
itself, he finds that he has nothing to say. 
If I speak, for the moment, purely from a 
literary point of view we could believe 
England's war to be an unjust one, things 
would be more cheerful ! The satirical genius 
at least would be busy: some of our writers 
during the South African War had the time 
of their lives. But fouling one's own nest 
the normal occupation of the satirist can- 
not be thought of when we are all agreed 
about presenting a " united front " to the foe. 
The " romance of war " is badly blown upon, 
and there is nothing more dull than abusing 
distant foreigners. About a just war there 
is in an age which has outgrown war al- 
though it has not discovered a substitute for 
it nothing to be said at all that cannot be 
said perfectly in a leading article. 

From the artistically creative point of 
view, therefore, the first twelve months of the 
war have been almost completely barren. All 
the better kind of writers who were in a posi- 
tion to join the forces have done so. Of the 
others, some have lapsed into complete silence; 
some have attempted to write fine literature 
about the war and failed abysmally; and 
others have, so to speak, gone into political 
journalism. Of these last, Mr. Arnold Ben- 
nett and Mr. Hilaire Belloc have made the 
greatest successes. Mr. Bennett has been 
writing articles weekly in the London " Daily 
News" on all sorts of topical subjects, from 
Conscription to the Position of Trade Unions 
and from War Pensions to the Selection of 
Staff Officers; and he has been doing it with 
invariable and characteristic efficiency. As 
for Mr. Belloc, he had the good fortune to be 
about the only intelligent man in England 
who had taken an interest in warfare during 
times of peace. The result was that the war 
found him ready equipped with the tactical,

mechanical, and geographical jargon which 
his colleagues had to acquire in feverish haste 
after hostilities had begun. His pen was 
engaged early by an ancient but, at that 
time, not very flourishing weekly, " Land and 
Water"; he contributes an enormous bale of 
comment, freely sprinkled with engaging dia- 
grams, to every issue; and his success has 
been such that wherever one goes one finds the 
name " Bellow " or " Beeloc " on the lips of fat 
old gentlemen who, a year ago, had never so 
much as heard of the author of "Emmanuel 
Burden," "The Path to Rome," and "Cau- 
tionary Tales." Mr. Shaw, besides his " Com- 
mon Sense," has written a certain number of 
war articles: but no new play from him 
appears likely. Mr. Chesterton, who, after 
his illness, is "fitter" than he has been for 
years, appears to be confining himself to the 
war; Mr. Wells is writing about the war 
everywhere ; and such of the novelists as have 
recently published new books wrote them, in 
most cases, before M. Princip let off his re- 
volver at Serajevo. The poets Mr. Yeats, 
Mr. Bridges, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Sturge Moore, 
Mr. de la Mare, Mr. W. H. Davies, and others 
have almost all been completely or nearly 
silent. Several of them have had one "go" 
at a war poem, but the " go " was usually " no 
go." Mr. Bridges's 

" England stands for Honour, 
God defend the Right," 

struck the typical note; and Mr. William 
Watson and Mr. Stephen Phillips, each of 
whom has been flooding the press with pom- 
pous metrical banalities, can do this sort of 
thing better than their superiors. The frag- 
ments of real literature produced by the war 
may be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
Mr. Hardy wrote a moving little poem about 
soldiers marching off and a critical doubter 
watching them; "A. E." has written several 
good poems about the criminality of war, 
which, one imagines, the " Times " only 
printed because it did not understand them; 
and Rupert Brooke, before he went to his 
death in the Dardanelles, produced a group of 
sonnets which, if they did not equal the best 
of his previous work, were nevertheless full 
of fine feeling, and admirable in their crafts- 
manship. But good poetry or prose not 
about the war has been still rarer since the 
war began. Scarcely any has been published; 
and, as far as one can gather from one's re- 
searches amongst one's own friends, none is 
being written. How, as I say, can one expect 
it, in an intellectual atmosphere blended of 
ennui, anxiety, and disgust? A few nights 
ago I was standing in a London street. High 



over my head not immediately over it, I 
am happy to say was what the newspapers, 
with perfect accuracy but rather tiresome 
iteration, describe as a cigar-shaped object. 
Faintly luminous, and with a row of small 
lights underneath it, the Zeppelin moved 
slowly across the moonless sky. Guns were 
roaring; the little white stars of shell-bursts 
sprinkled the air; and from time to time 
there was the crash of a bomb which meant 
the end of somebody's home. It was not a 
very terrible or exciting spectacle. The curios- 
ity of the population was a little heightened 
by the slight nip of danger, and it flocked to 
its doors in nightdresses and pyjamas, staring 
up quietly and, in the end, with a certain dis- 
appointment at this strange intruder which 
was providing so very inadequate a display of 
fireworks. On the practical mind, the event 
no doubt impressed more firmly than ever the 
need for " seeing the thing through." To the 
contemplative mind, the sight of this gas-bag, 
with its thirty men, shivering, possibly, 
with fear, dropping explosives upon a few 
harmless civilians in this immense city, was 
pitiful and a little comic. But whichever 
aspect of it struck the onlooker most, he cer- 
tainly did not feel inclined to go home and 
compose a song about Roses, or an essay on 
the March of the Seasons or the Heart of a 
Child. We are not visited by Zeppelins daily, 
but the distraction is only a matter of degree. 
A few miles away across the Channel that 
long-drawn-out tragedy is going on. We can 
think of nothing else; and, if we could, we 
should feel sheepish about admitting it. 

How long this paralysis of the imagination 
will continue one cannot say. It might be 
argued that if the war goes on much longer 
those who have to stay at home will begin to 
get, in a manner, acclimatized to it, and one 
by one pick up the thread of their old inter- 
ests. But, under modern conditions, that 
scarcely seems possible. During the Napo- 
leonic Wars, when communications were few 
and slow, and our comparatively small armies 
consisted of regular troops and foreign mer- 
cenaries, it was not difficult for an English- 
man to retire, say, to the Lake District, study 
nature, and not hear about the war from one 
month's end to another. To-day every family 
has men in the trenches, every morning's 
paper may tell us that they were going 
through hell a few hours ago: we are con- 
tinually seeing men off and continually 
shocked by the loss of friends. The lapse of 
time may possibly mean a little more free- 
dom for the controversialist and the satirist. 
The self-imposed gags which almost all writers 
of those kinds have put into their own mouths

may become wearisome and be removed. But 
the man whose business it is to produce imagi- 
native literature, and who, for that purpose, 
has to live, in a manner, detached from the 
every-day existence of his fellows, is going to 
be hobbled as long as the war lasts. At a time 
like this, the Human Being and the English- 
man come first and the Man of Letters is no- 
where. It may be that a few artists with an 
unusual strength of mind or an unusual 
frigidity of temperament will be able to pro- 
duce something. But, generally speaking, one 
will be well advised in expecting very little 
really important or impressive or beautiful 
work until the guns have ceased to thunder 

and the Congress of has begun its 

labors, j. c. SQUIRE. 

London, Sept. 25, 1915. 



CASUAL_CO_MMENT. 

READING BY THE CLOCK is a practice that 
commends itself to a certain order of minds. 
Those who regard method as all-important 
like to map out their day's doings on the 
clock-dial. A teacher of our acquaintance 
was fond of extolling the advantages of this 
mode of procedure, letting the stroke of the 
clock rather than one's unprompted inclina- 
tion determine what to read or study, when 
to do it, and when to leave off. But to most 
hearty and healthy natures this is a quench- 
ing of the spirit, a fostering of pedantry, and 
a sure road to the dry-as-dust desolation of 
utter barrenness and disgust. Nevertheless 
worthy things have been achieved by men 
notoriously addicted to these methodical hab- 
its in their reading and, indeed, in all their 
occupations. Franklin and Jefferson come 
readily to mind as famous for their self- 
scrutiny and their love of self-imposed order 
and method, with little or no margin left for 
that glad spontaneity which is the very 
breath of existence to those who regard life 
rather as an art than as a science. A writer 
in "The Canadian Magazine" throws some 
interesting light on a somewhat celebrated 
Nova Scotian of the nineteenth century, 
Joseph Howe, " a leader in the fight for 
responsible government and an active partici- 
pant in public affairs till after Confedera- 
tion." He was founder of " The Nova Sco- 
tian" (newspaper) and published, at a heavy 
loss, " Haliburton's History of Nova Scotia." 
A man of no little achievement in the face of 
obstacles, he seems to have made that achieve- 
ment possible, in part at least, by his strict 
economy of time and his adherence to a pre- 
established schedule. Rising at five o'clock in 



the summer and at seven in the winter, Joseph 
Howe ordered his day by certain rules, of 
which the following is a specimen : " Studies 
Read books from 5 to 8, or 7 to 9, science 
and history chiefly, then breakfast and walk, 
business and newspapers till 3, exercise and 
rumination till six, tea and chat till seven, 
write two hours, read till twelve." Another 
note for self-guidance was this : " Intellec- 
tual occupation Review arithmetic, French, 
and grammar, read poetry more, speeches 
more. Scripture 2 hours on Sunday." Another 
passage, equally characteristic, runs as fol- 
lows: "Company avoid none that is not 
bad, be polite and cheerful to all. Try to 
learn something from and communicate some- 
thing to everyone you meet, but make con- 
stant companions only of those from whom 
information can be gathered and the intellect 
strengthened." By publishing, with a com- 
mentary, these and other extracts from " The 
Howe Papers " in the above-mentioned maga- 
zine, Mr. Francis A. Carman has made his 
readers acquainted with a strong and attrac- 
tive, albeit somewhat precise and pedantic, 
personality. 

THE AUTHOR'S THIRST FOR APPLAUSE, the 
insatiate craving for recognition, is probably 
the chief motive that prompts to literary ex- 
pression, as indeed to all artistic utterance. To 
get the full enjoyment of a beautiful thought 
or noble conception, or even of a comical con- 
ceit or whimsical fancy, one must feel that 
the enjoyment is shared by at least one other 
person ; and so the thirst for applause is not 
wholly an ignoble passion for self-aggrandize- 
ment. But those successful and widely-known 
writers who pay the penalty for their success 
and fame by being made the recipients of 
innumerable unsolicited confidences and man- 
uscripts from would-be authors are often led 
to believe that the hope and expectation be- 
hind all these artless demonstrations can be 
little else than that they will elicit prompt 
and unqualified sympathy and approval. An 
interesting word in this connection occurs in 
Mr. A. C. Benson's chapter on authorship in 
his latest volume of essays (reviewed on 
another page). He says: "The social and 
gregarious instinct is really very dominant in 
all art; and all writers who have a public at 
all must become aware of this fact, by the 
number of manuscripts which are submitted 
to them by would-be authors, who .ask for 
advice and criticism and introductions to pub- 
lishers. It would be quite easy for me, if I 
complied fully with all such requests, to 
spend the greater part of my time in the 
labor of commenting on these manuscripts. . .

I suppose that painters and sculptors do not 
suffer so much in this way, because it is not 
easy to send about canvasses or statues by 
parcels post. But nothing is easier than to 
slip a manuscript into an envelope and to 
require an opinion from an author. I will 
confess that I very seldom refuse these re- 
quests. At the moment at which I write I 
have three printed novels and a printed book 
of travel, a poem, and two volumes of essays 
in manuscript upon my table, and I shall 
make shift to say something in reply, though, 
except for the satisfaction of the authors in 
question, I believe' that my pains will be 
thrown away, for the simple reason that it is 
a very lengthy business to teach anyone how 
to write, and also partly because what these 
authors desire is not criticism but sympathy 
and admiration." Astonishing and, to a con- 
siderate person, fairly inconceivable is the 
unrestraint with which these demands are 
made upon a busy author's time and strength. 


A NOTABLE CHAPTER IN AMERICAN LIBRARY 

HISTORY has to do with the founding and sub- 
sequent history of what finally became the 
free public library of Trenton, N. J. Dr. 
Thomas Cadwalader, one of Franklin's asso- 
ciates in establishing the Library Company of 
Philadelphia in 1731, was for seven years a 
resident and a part of that time mayor of 
Trenton. Before returning to Philadelphia 
to live, in 1750, he gave 500 for a public 
library for Trenton, of similar character to 
that in Philadelphia. In 1776 this library 
was almost destroyed by the British, but 
some of the books were saved and did service 
in subsequent collections for general use. 
The great-grandson of this early benefactor 
of Trenton, John Lambert Cadwalader, hand- 
somely supplemented his ancestor's gift by 
supplying a much-needed addition to the 
present library building of the city. A re- 
port of the dedicatory exercises has been pub- 
lished by the library, and it contains a sketch 
of Mr. Cadwalader by Mr. Henry W. Taft, 
one of the speakers. Active as a trustee of 
the great New York library which he helped 
Dr. Billings to build up and put into running 
order, Mr. Cadwalader was naturally also 
interested in the library of his native Tren- 
ton an interest that culminated recently in 
the manner indicated above. Eeaders of the 
Billings biography do not need to be told of 
his close and friendly relations with Dr. Bill- 
ings, Dr. Weir Mitchell, who was his (Cad- 
walader's) brother-in-law, Colonel Higginson, 
Frank Millet, and innumerable other promi- 
nent men of his time. He had a genius for 
friendship, as well as a genius for unobtru- 



sive generosity and service. " He had great 
vivacity in conversation," says Mr. Taft, his 
law partner and intimate friend, " and his 
pointed comment and witty repartee con- 
stantly enlivened the circle of his friends." 
He was also devoted to the rod and gun, and 
"had difficulty in seeing how there was any 
salvation for a man whose soul was dead to 
the fascination of such sports." The promi- 
nence of the Cadwalader family in the Revo- 
lution, in the establishment of our national 
government, and in the public affairs of 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, adds interest 
to the history of this w r orthy scion of the 
stock, whose useful life ended last year. 

THE UNWRITTEN AMERICAN NOVEL, the na- 
tive masterpiece for which we and the rest 
of the world have long been waiting, need not 
remain unwritten for lack of subject matter. 
Our supply of the raw material for fiction is 
abundant and varied and of the best quality, 
as Mr. Meredith Nicholson reminds us in his 
current "Atlantic " article on " The Open 
Season for American Novelists." " The songs 
have not all been written, nor the tales told," 
he reassures his comrades of the pen, calling 
their attention to the neglected opportunities 
before them and urging upon them above all 
the courage to be natural, to refrain from 
Anglicizing or Gallicizing or Russianizing 
their work. He bemoans " the ill luck that 
has carried so many American fiction-writers 
to foreign shores," and adds: "If Haw- 
thorne had never seen Italy, but had clung to 
Salem, I am disposed to think American lit- 
erature would be the richer. If fate had not 
carried Mr. Howells to Venice, but had posted 
him on the Ohio during the mighty struggle 
of the '60's; and if Mr. James had been sta- 
tioned at Chicago, close to the deep currents 
of national feeling, what a monumental li- 
brary of vital fiction they might have given 
us! If Mrs. Wharton's splendid gifts had 
been consecrated to the service of Pittsburg 
rather than New York and Paris, how much 
greater might be our debt to her ! " Without 
confining our hopes for the future of Amer- 
ican fiction to the possibilities represented by 
the turmoil and smoke of Pittsburg and Cin- 
cinnati and Chicago possibilities perhaps 
unduly emphasized by Mr. Nicholson we 
may reasonably look forward to interesting if 
not remarkable developments in our x imagina- 
tive literature as the swift seasons roll. In 
these days when our country is becoming the 
world's creditor in commerce and finance, it 
would be gratifying if we could at the same 
time open a credit account of a less math- 
ematically calculable kind, and if spiritual

and intellectual values could more often find 
their best expression in a currency minted 

within our borders. 



A WINDMILL CONVERTED INTO A LIBRARY will 

not be discovered even by the most observant 
traveller more than once in a lifetime, if as 
often as that. A church thus transformed is 
no unheard-of thing, barns have been pressed 
into service for the shelter of books, and 
somewhere there is said to be a gas-tank re- 
modelled and fitted up for library purposes; 
but where shall we find a public library in the 
form that aroused Don Quixote to one of his 
first exploits in knight-errantry? Mr. Ed- 
mund L. Pearson tells his readers, in the 
Boston " Transcript," that this strange sight 
greets the visitor to Wainscott, Long Island, 
He says further : " The mill was first erected 
in another town. A date carved on the floor 
indicates that it is at least a century old. 
There are a few similar mills in some other 
Long Island towns not far away. This one 
was moved to "Wainscott a number of years 
ago, and used for its original purpose of 
grinding corn until recent days. The machin- 
ery, millstones, and some of the grain are still 
there. Some of the latter occasionally sifts 
down on the books from the floor above a 
fact which amuses but does not bother the 
energetic librarian. She opens the library on 
several afternoons each week, and dispenses 
books to all who come." The collection, of 
books, he adds, is smaller than that of the 
Boston Public Library, for instance, but the 
ventilation is better than in the nobly vaulted 
Bates Hall of that great library, and there is 
no superfluity of red tape in the rules and 
regulations. It is a wonderful story that he 
tells us; but seeing is believing, and so he 
publishes a photograph of this truly unique 
public library, with its four windmill sails 
still spread to the winds. 



ABORTIVE EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS are wit- 
nessed at this time of year in all our colleges 
and universities. Young men and women by 
the thousand start, voluntarily or under pres- 
sure, and more or less hopefully, on an acad- 
emic course leading to innumerable delightful 
possibilities in the way of honors and distinc- 
tions and ultimate fame and fortune in the 
great world beyond ; but how many there are 
that drop out of the race even before it is well 
begun ! Any college graduate will easily re- 
call dim memories of perhaps a dozen or more 
classmates of that intensely vivid period of 
his adolescence, the first term of freshman 
year, who speedily and rather unaccountably 
faded from his view with the falling of the 



autumn leaves or the coming of the Christ- 
mas holidays. This lamentable lack of stay- 
ing power must have been in the minds of 
those \vho shape the curriculum at Brown 
University when they announced this year a 
new freshman course in " orientation." In- 
struction in the purpose and meaning of col- 
lege study and college life will be given to 
all members of the entering class, and it may 
be that an earnest and sympathetic word at 
the outset will help to kindle the young 
collegian's zeal and stiffen his backbone so 
that he will be in less danger of educational 
shipwreck. President Faunce ventures the as- 
sertion that " nearly fifty per cent of the stu- 
dents who enter some American colleges drop 
out before graduation. About twenty-five per 
cent drop out from our best colleges (except 
in a few small, compact institutions, where 
the per cent is smaller)." He asks: "How 
shall we grapple with this waste and wreck- 
age of hope and intention ? Harvard says by 
freshmen dormitories, Princeton says by pre- 
ceptors, Brown relies on small numbers in 
classes permitting much more personal con- 
tact than in the large universities ; the fresh- 
man advisers; the new course in aims and 
values of the college course." But, after all, 
does not at least a partial explanation of the 
difficulty lie in the fact that so many sons of 
rich men are to-day sent to college, whereas 
in the past it was the poor boys who went? 


A HAMLETLESS " HAMLET " is so difficult to 
conceive that it has furnished the world with 
a universally familiar phrase applicable to 
all attempts to achieve a desired result with- 
out recourse to the chief factor contributory 
thereto. And yet there is a vague tradition 
that this " Hamlet " with the part of Hamlet 
left out was once actually presented on the. 
stage by a company of strolling players who, 
at a certain one-night stand somewhere, 
found themselves suddenly bereft, by illness, 
of the services of their leading performer. 
But the piece had been advertised for that 
night, and there seemed no way to save the 
situation except by acting the play with its 
title role omitted. The success of this ardu- 
ous undertaking is left to the imagination. 
In a very readable contribution to the Octo- 
ber "Yale Review" Professor Brander Mat- 
thews begins with a brief rehearsal of the 
foregoing legend, but is constrained to add: 
"Despite diligent endeavor, I have not been 
able to discover where or when this fabled 
performance was believed to have taken place. 
Still less successful have I been in my search 
for one of the spectators at this unique rep- 
resentation of Shakespeare's masterpiece."

Then he proceeds to name a number of suc- 
cessful plays that actually omit, by design, 
each its leading or at any rate a prominent 
character. That is, the character is presented 
in the third person only, never appearing on 
the stage. In this peculiar species of drama 
Professor Matthews places Mr. George Mid- 
dleton's play, "Their Wife," Sardou's "La 
Famille Benoiton," and, in a modified sense, 
" The Second Mrs. Tanqueray," " Rosmers- 
holm," and one or two other modern plays. 
The entire article ("'Hamlet' with Hamlet 
Left Out") is a curious study of a difficult 
device employed with subtlety and success by 
a few playwrights and wisely avoided by the 
great majority. 

BOOK-BORROWERS' RESPONSIBILITIES are often 
taken very lightly. Hence the thousands of 
books borrowed and never returned. An 
individual lender cannot well proclaim and 
enforce a system of fines and other coercive 
measures to ensure the return of his precious 
volumes; but a library can and commonly 
does employ such a system. Its necessity is 
demonstrated in the statistical section of 
almost any library report. Let us take a few 
typical public libraries, large and small, and 
see to what extent delinquent borrowers have 
to be punished in the course of a year. The 
New York Public Library collected, in 1914, 
in fines on overdue books and in payments 
for lost books, $36,129.79. The Boston library, 
in the same year, received $6,502.44 in fines, 
and $426.36 for lost books. Cleveland reports 
receipts of $9,283.70 in fines. St. Louis shows 
$2,682.64 as the annual amount of fines col- 
lected, and $249.15 received for "books sold, 
lost and paid for." Brooklyn denies us any 
clear light on this question by lumping to- 
gether " fines and sale of publications " at 
$24,034.32. Grand Rapids collected $1,139.70 
in " book fines," and reports a total collection, 
in the forty-four years of its existence, of 
"nearly $20,000." Galesburg's yearly fine 
receipts were $358.93. At Lincoln (Nebraska) 
the " fines and penalties " amounted to 
$1,052.45, and "books lost" (and paid for), 
$55.57. Wilmington (Delaware) reports 
"library desk receipts" as $836.53. Many 
libraries refuse to aid us in this research, 
either making no mention of the yearly fines 
or including them in "other receipts." But 
enough evidence has been adduced in the fore- 
going figures to prove the necessity, lamenta- 
ble though it be, of imposing legal penalties 
on those who abuse their public-library privi- 
leges. 



NOT THE LEAST OF LINCOLN'S MANY BIOG- 
RAPHERS, and certainly not the last, was 
drowned near Foxboro, Mass., Sept. 29, while 
bathing in Beaumont Pond. Alonzo Roth- 
schild will be best remembered as the author 
of " Lincoln, Master of Men," a study of that 
quality of authority over his associates and 
contemporaries which, however lost sight of 
amid his other conspicuous attributes, was 
undoubtedly possessed by this one of our 
national heroes in common with all who 
before or since have taken the lead in great 
causes or arduous enterprises. But it was 
Lincoln's way to gain his ends with no need- 
less display of imperiousness, and that was a 
part of the secret of his success, however much 
he was misunderstood and under-estimated by 
many of his contemporaries. The essential 
with him was to get the thing done. Mr. 
Rothschild felt the appeal of this side of Lin- 
coln's character, and was moved to enter upon 
the study that resulted in the above-named 
book. He was born in New York, in 1862, 
the son of poor parents, or parents so situated 
that he felt it his duty to cut short his school- 
ing and become an office boy at four dollars a 
week in order to contribute his share toward 
the family purse. But he rapidly rose to 
higher things. Besides journalism and au- 
thorship he took an active part in the work 
of the Society for Ethical Culture. His 
attributes of mind and heart, as they show 
themselves in the retrospect, were of a sort to 
beget deep regret at his loss. 


EMBROIDERED HISTORY presents to most eyes 
an appearance so much more attractive than 
plain history that the historian's temptation 
to supply the embroidery is all but irresisti- 
ble. To spoil a good story in the telling, by 
sticking to literal fact, is something that most 
of us look upon with some contempt; to re- 
fuse to soar in the upper realms of romance 
is the mark of a grovelling spirit. Hence the 
popular acclaim given to such fascinating 
creations as Abbott's " History of Napoleon 
Bonaparte" and Froude's not too painfully 
accurate pictures of the past. This inex- 
haustible theme of historical inaccuracy has 
given us a library of more or less lively read- 
ing, a fresh addition to which will be found 
in Professor Hart's "American Historical 
Liars " in the current " Harper's Magazine." 
Captain John Smith and Parson Weems and 
the late Augustus C. Buell, with a number of 
others, are pitilessly pilloried by the Harvard 
historian for their refusal to remain content 
with the unadorned truth; and they and all 
their tribe are at the end dismissed in this

biting fashion : " Throughout this catalogue 
of gifted writers who transferred to history 
and biography talents that belong in the field 
of the serial novels, only one general com- 
ment may be applied : Whether they are forg- 
ing documents, capturing the choice pages of 
previous writers, or simply letting their fancy 
play upon a historical problem, they are all 
subject to Joe Gargery's remark: 'Lies is 
lies. Howsoever they come, they didn't ought 
to come, and they come from the father of 
lies, and work round to the same.' " 



POETIC VISION AND GRIM REALITY are brought 
into startling contrast by certain recent occur- 
rences not far from St. Paul's. To more than 
one student of current history there has 
doubtless come/ to mind in these days Mr. 
Alfred Noyes's beautiful piece of verse pic- 
turing a walk down Fleet Street when Lon- 
don glowed under a foggy sunset "like one 
huge cobwebbed flagon of old wine," and the 
soft sky 
" Flowed through the roaring thoroughfares, 

transfused 
Their hard, sharp outlines, blurred the throngs 

of black 

On either pavement, blurred the rolling stream 
Of red and yellow buses, till the town 
Turned to a golden suburb of the clouds, 
And, round that mighty bubble of St. Paul's, 
Over the upturned faces of the street, 
An air-ship slowly sailed, with whirring fans, 
A voyager in the new-found realms of gold, 
A shadowy silken chrysalis whence should break 
What radiant wings in centuries to be." 
From the " shadowy silken chrysalis " of 
actual fact, a few weeks ago, there certainly 
broke things radiant and astonishing, but 
also terrifying and death-dealing. The poet's 
vision was at fault only in stopping con- 
siderably short of the vivid reality, and in 
postponing its fulfilment to " centuries to be." 



A CURIOUS SPECIMEN OF LEARNED HUMOR is 

brought to public notice by bibliographers 
interested in the matchless collection of Elze- 
virs and other rare books in the Warsaw 
University Library, to which recent events 
have directed the attention of book-lovers. 
The example of rather ponderous playfulness 
here referred to is in mediaeval Latin, and is 
thus entitled : " Dissertationum Ludicrarum et 
Amoenitatum Scriptores Varii." As this title 
indicates, the volume is made up of sundry 
facetious essays from various pens. Among 
these amusing trifles, the recreations of their 
erudite authors' leisure hours, are to be noted 
a disquisition in praise of the gout, by Bir- 
baldus Pirkheimer ; one by Girolamo Cardano 
on the same sprightly theme ; one in praise of 



mud, by Majorragio; one in praise of the 
goose, by the elder Scaliger; and other pan- 
egyrics in like vein on the ant, the flea, the 
louse, the elephant, and the swan; also an 
anonymous piece on the death of a magpie, 
a "nuptial allocution," an essay on the art 
of swimming, one on "the reign of the fly," 
etc., all, including titles, in the language 
used universally by medieval scholars. The 
compilation, which may perhaps have served 
as a sort of "Joe Miller's Jest Book" among 
the learned of its day, was originally pub- 
lished at Leyden about 1625; but the War- 
saw copy is of the 1644 edition, which is 
considered the best. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

THE COMING- WOBLD-LANGUAGE, AND SOME 
OTHER MATTERS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In view of your comment upon my remarks, in 
your issue of Sept. 16 (page 206), may I be per- 
mitted to explain what I meant when I said to 
the interviewer from " The New York Times " 
that we were being " brought nearer to a univer- 
sal language, a sort of interlingnistic conglom- 
erate" by the war? This was no more than that 
English was becoming the lingua franca for uni- 
versal use. I based this belief that English is 
becoming more of a world-language than any 
other language upon statistics of usage nothing 
else. The English language is now spoken by 
more than one hundred and fifty millions of peo- 
ple; German by more than one hundred and 
twenty millions; Russian by ninety millions; 
French by sixty millions; Spanish by fifty-five 
millions; Italian by forty millions; and Portu- 
guese by forty millions. 

Just how many persons have been using Esper- 
anto during the twenty-eight years that have 
passed since its invention by Dr. Zamenhof in 
1887, I do not know. But this I do know, that 
from an examination of approximately 20,000 
words from the " New Standard Dictionary," En- 
glish may be correctly described as an interlin- 
guistic conglomerate, for the following are the

A 

In the same issue of THE DIAL referred to 
above, your generous reviewer of my " Essentials 
of English Speech" takes me to task for saying 
that Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, " wrote the 
first sonnets ever written in English," and chides 
me for making " no mention of Wyatt, Surrey's 
senior by fourteen or fifteen years, and acknowl- 
edged by him to be his master in poetry, and 
commonly credited with having taken the lead in 
importing the sonnet into our literature." Will 
you permit me to say in reply that some things 
that have been " commonly credited " investigation 
and time have proved to have been incorrectly 
credited? As examples, I need only to cite the 
well-known Chatterton and Macpherson imposi- 
tions. Samuel Johnson's exposure of the latter 
brought the famous lexicographer a challenge 
from Macpherson. Dr. Johnson is commonly 
credited with having purchased a stout oak 
cudgel and with having answered in a well-known 
letter that he would repel violence, and was not 
to be deterred from detecting what he thought to 
be a cheat from any fear of the menaces of a 
ruffian. 

But to return to the English sonnet. On page 
304 of his "Amenities of English Literature," pub- 
lished in 1841, Isaac D'Israeli says, " The Earl of 
Surrey composed the first sonnets in the English 
language." In the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," 
volume xxvi, eleventh edition, p. 139, I find 
" Surrey, indeed, expressly acknowledges Wyatt 
as his master in poetry. As their poems appeared 
in one volume, long after the death of both, their 
names will always be closely associated," but in 
the original form of this article, which appears in 
the ninth edition of the " Britannica " (vol. xxii, 
p. 731), the statement is "Seeing, however, that 
their poems were first published in the same vol- 
ume, many years after the death of both, their 
names can never be dissociated and it must always 



be hard to say which was the leader in the various 
new and beautiful forms of verse . . introduced 
into English poetry." The copyright date of this 
edition of the " Britannica " is 1875. Dr. William 
F. Collier, in his " History of English Literature," 
new edition, dated 1894, wrote (p. 92) : " Surrey 
is said to have written also the first English son- 
nets." In the " Dictionary of National Biog- 
raphy," edited by Leslie Stephen and Sidney Lee, 
and published in 1891, I find the following, under 
the title " Howard," in volume xxviii, p. 28 : 
" Surrey, who although the disciple of Wyatt was 
at all points his master's superior, was the earliest 
Englishman to imitate with any success Italian 
poetry in English verse. . . Surrey's taste in the 
choice of his masters and his endeavours to adapt 
new metres to English poetry are his most inter- 
esting characteristics. The sonnet and the ' ottava 
rima' were first employed by him and Wyatt." 
This was written by Sir Sidney Lee. 

And now as to the other peccadilloes charged 
against me, I may point out that, in English, the 
correctness of a form or of a construction is not 
impaired because nothing analogous to it exists 
in the language, any more than that the correct- 
ness of a word is to be challenged because there is 
no other in the language resembling it in sound 
or spelling. Your gentle reviewer does not like 
"equally as." Nor did Coleridge, yet Sir James 
Murray recognizes it, and cites Francis William 
Newman as authority for its use. 

The expression " no less than thirty " is char- 
acterized as a " questionable construction," yet is 
one that dates from the Old English Chronicles 
(1121). It was used by Shakespeare ("Taming 
of the Shrew," act ii, sc. 1), by Steele (" Tatler," 
No. 46, p. 12), and by Macaulay in his Essay on 
Warren Hastings "No less than twenty Arti- 
cles of impeachment." Again, the reviewer writes 
" of the same book we read on the same page that 
' the sanitation of cities is carefully preserved.' " 
Is not this the reductio ad absurdum of criticism? 
What I wrote is " Utopia . . is an ideal common- 
wealth in which vice does not flourish. . . Agri- 
culture is the chief industry and everybody works. 
The sanitation of cities is carefully preserved." 
The reference here is clearly to Utopia, the com- 
monwealth, not to " Utopia," the book. If the use 
of the word " preserved " is what " jars," then let 
us consult the dictionary and learn that in such a 
connection the word means "maintained intact or 
unimpaired," and is correctly used. As for 
"applied into," this I cannot find; wherever it 
occurs the text perhaps should read " applied 
unto," and I shall be greatly obliged if you will 
favor me with the page on which it may be found.

[Regarding the latter part of Dr. Vize- 
telly's communication, the truth sterns to be 
that Surrey remodelled and refined the son- 
net after Wyatt had introduced it; but to 
assert without qualification that he "wrote 
the first sonnets ever written in English " is 
to invite contradiction. Authorities might be

cited in great number, but it must here suf- 
fice to quote from Garnett and Gosse's 
" English Literature " the statement in re- 
gard to Wyatt that " the feature of his work 
which gives him his chief importance in the 
history of English poetical literature . . is 
his introduction of the sonnet into 'English 
poetry." " Equally as appropriate " offends 
by its manifest redundancy. " Less than 
thirty " has good authority, but " fewer than 
thirty" stands unchallenged, and the ques- 
tion remains whether it is wise, in trying to 
promote the cause of good English, to use a 
construction avoided by many careful writers. 
It may be, if it is felt that a principle is in- 
volved. Of course the reviewer's comment on 
" sanitation " as being " carefully preserved " 
referred only to the choice of verb, which 
still seems not the happiest possible. It 
should be noted that the italics in the quota- 
tions from the review are not the reviewer's. 
"Applied into," unless the reviewer's notes 
are at fault, will be found on page 308, one- 
third of the way down. THE KEVIEWER.] 



" BRYANT AND THE NEW POETRY." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

As I have been making a pilgrimage to the two 
Panama expositions, my attention has been called 
only recently to the communication from Mr. 
John L. Hervey in your issue of August 15, enti- 
tled " Bryant and the New Poetry." You and he 
will pardon me, therefore, if my answer seems 
somewhat tardy. 

What did I say at that Whitman dinner, now 
four months in the past? Mr. Hervey admits that 
he " cannot recall more than the drift, the pur- 
port," of a part of it, and I cannot pretend to 
remember with complete exactness. I can state, 
however, that my subject was not " The New 
Poetry," but " The New Movement in Poetry," and 
that I did not ascribe this movement to America 
alone, since English poets have done their full 
share in it, or say that it " had originated in the 
sanctum of her [my] magazinelet, ' Poetry.' " I 
may have said that " Poetry " was the first maga- 
zine to give a large group of young poets a chance 
to be heard, or that, as the New York " Sun " said 
editorially in its issue of Sept. 12, "'Poetry' right- 
fully stands at the head of the new movement." 
If I was so foolish as to make any " statement of 
doctrine," or put forth any " promulgation of 
law " on a subject so delicate, so fluid, so irreduci- 
ble to any definition or theory, as the art of 
poetry, I shall be obliged to Mr. Hervey if he will 
add chapter and book to his offhand accusation. 

Also he will perhaps show how I " asserted, at 
least by inference," that Whitman is " the patron 
saint of the movement." Whitman was a great 
revolutionist, and no doubt he is one of many cos- 
mopolitan influences which have tended of late to 
broaden the boundaries of poetic art in the En- 
glish language. 



But Mr. Hervey resents most seriously " the 
drift, the purport " of certain ill-remembered 
remarks of mine about Bryant. 

As I have made a definite charge against Bry- 
ant, and as neither Mr. Hervey nor I can pretend 
to remember exactly in what form I stated it at 
the Whitman dinner, perhaps you will permit me 
to refer to an editorial in " Poetry " for July, 
which does not lack precision. In that editorial 
I told of a publisher's statement that Bryant, 
toward the end of his long life, used to sell his 
name, along with his venerable portrait, as the 
author of books which he neither wrote nor edited, 
such as " Bryant's History of the United States " 
and " Bryant's Collection of Poetry and Song," to 
such an extent that he was known among New 
York publishers as " the great national tone- 
imparter." The article then continues: 

" This story always comes back to me when I make 
a detour from Fifth Avenue to see the beautiful rear 
facade of the New York Public Library. Here a 
throned figure of the venerable poet faces the park 
named in his honor, and offers us his life as a high 
inspiration to American youth. To whose memory 
was the statue erected the poet of the Thanatopsis 
or the ' great national tone-imparter ' ? If the former, 
are we not honoring too much the man who did his 
best work at nineteen? and if the latter, are we not 
honoring too much the man who sold out! 

" To have done one's best work in youth is proof that 
one has lived downward rather than upward. Long 
is the roll of artists who, beginning with more genius 
than character, shuffle off their glory like a rich gar- 
ment and sink down in rags or broadcloth to a 
sordid feast. Indeed, so often does the world watch 
this spectacle that the early death of the inspired one 
seems the only sure consecration. 

" There is only one code of honor for an artist to 
be true to his vision. Bryant preferred to lead a com- 
fortable life, and be a good journalist rather than a 
poet, and so he descended from the serene nobility of 
the Thanatopsis, to the puerile pieties of the Hymn 
to tlie Sea, The Future Life, The Crowded Street and 
many other truly orthodox utterances. Even The 
Forest Hymn, perhaps the best of these, says merely 
the proper and expected thing, offering bland counsels 
of moderation: 

But let me often to these solitudes 

Retire, and in Thy presence reassure 

My feeble virtue. Here its enemies. 

The passions, at Thy plainer footsteps shrink 

And tremble, and are still. 

" If the passions were indeed the enemies of this 
poet's ' feeble virtue,' they never got the upper hand. 
At least they do not appear in his poetry. It is said 
that Mr. Bryan pronounces To a Waterfowl the finest 
American poem a preference which marks the 
limitation of his reading or taste; but this, which is 
no doubt Bryant's best lyric, is also marred by the 
ever-present and expedient moral. The famous ' Truth 
crushed to earth ' quatrain from The Battlefield is the 
only bit of his poetry, after the Thanatopsis, in which 
his religiosity rises for a moment to higher ground 
and assumes something of prophetic dignity. 

" Bryant was, in short, a man born to be a poet who 
sacrificed the muse, not to those violent enemies, the 
flesh and the devil, but to that more insidious one. 
the world or, in other words, comfort and respecta- 
bility. Now and then a brief flash of inspiration dis- 
turbed his placidity, but gradually the light went out, 
until, in his tone-imparting old age, he could not even 
see that he was sitting in darkness."

THE DIAL

Probably even Mr. Hervey would admit that the 
greater part of Bryant's poetry was over-rated 
during and after his life, and that modern criti- 
cism can hardly be expected to take him and most 
of his contemporaries at their nineteenth-century 
face value. If Whitman admired him, it was part 
of the generosity of his nature that he admired 
almost everybody. If he lived to-day, no doubt he 
would praise Mr. Sandburg, and even say a good 
word for the magazine which had the honor of 
introducing him and many others as well, both 
radical and conservative! 

Whether any of our contemporaries, so intro- 
duced, " will live," it is quite beyond my power, 
or even Mr. Hervey's, to predict ; for I have never 
presumed to " speak in behalf of Time," but have 
always proclaimed, early and late, over and over 
again, that contemporary criticism cannot be 
final. " Poetry " is an exhibition place for current 
poetry, corresponding to our Art Institute exhibi- 
tions of current painting and sculpture. It would 
be rank injustice to deny to our artists and poets 
such places to be seen and heard, and no doubt it 
is right that critics and the public should praise 
or damn this or that in any exhibition, and that 
professional juries should even award prizes. But 
Time, which really means the accumulated opin- 
ions of experts, selects the masterpieces. 

In conclusion, permit me to take exception to 
Mr. Hervey's statement that " the verse printed in 
' Poetry ' " does not " convey a sense of the open 
air." If there is no open-air feeling in poems we 
have printed by Edith Wyatt, Ernest Rhys, 
Padraic Colum, James Stephens, Fannie Stearns 
Davis, Joyce Kilmer, Constance Skinner, John 
Gould Fletcher, and many others, I do not know 
where to find it in modern poetry.

"THE FEEELANDS" AND "UNCLE TOM'S 

CABIN." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

With your permission, I should like to present 
the following paraphrase of a portion of your 
review of Mr. Galsworthy's " The Freelands " 
(see THE DIAL for Sept. 16, page 219) as repre- 
senting what would undoubtedly have been your 
reviewer's method of dealing with " Uncle Tom's 
Cabin," had he been exercising his critical function 
when that book was published. Except for the 
substitution of Mrs. Stowe's name for Mr. Gals- 
worthy's, and the feminine for the masculine pro- 
noun, the only changes in phraseology which I 
have made in your review are indicated by the 
italicization of new words substituted for those 
used by your reviewer. 

" The pathos of it all, the appeal to pity, the suffer- 
ings of Uncle Tom, the despair which fills his soul 
these things are worked to their utmost in arousing 
our deepest sympathies for the victim. But what 
would Mrs. Stowe have? She urges that the condi- 
tions are intolerable which make such situations possi- 
ble. In other words, it is the slave system which is to 
blame, the system which gives the slave-holder this 
power over the private lives of his slaves. We admit 



that such interference is injudicious, and even to be 
condemned in principle; but, on the other hand, it is 
clearly a case of conscience with the slave-holder, to 
say nothing of legal rights. If such a thing as private 
ownership in slaves is admitted, the right of the 
owner to use them as he pleases is logically implied. 
So that Mrs. Stowe is in reality attacking the right of 
slave-holding, and if one believes in that right at all, 
one cannot be much stirred by this indirect assault 
upon it, which seems to us to be lacking in candor. 
We are in the heartiest sympathy with Mrs. Stowe in 
her detestation of people who seek to regulate the pri- 
vate affairs of other people, but the mischief that is 
done by such efforts is much more chargeable to 
Northern newspapers, abolition societies, etc., than to 
the owners of slaves or other property. While the lat- 
ter have at least a sound legal justification for their 
intolerance, the former have only their whims and 
petty prejudices; and the curtailments of liberty 
which they would impose excite our indignation far 
more deeply than do any restrictions imposed by the 
owners of slaves upon those whom they purchase to 
make productive use of their land. So it seems to us 
that Mrs. Stowe's lesson might have l>een made much 
more effective by the choice of a less dubious basis. 
Her real power is in her style rather than in her logi- 
cal process, and, for our part, we attach less impor- 
tance to all her special pleading and all the calculated 
ingenuity of her plot than we do to the single page in 
which, forgetting her thesis, she unfolds for us," 
etc., etc. 

Of course it is not my purpose to indicate or 
imply any analogy between " The Freelands " and 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin," although it might not be 
very difficult to trace such an analogy in certain 
important respects. But I wish merely to empha- 
size the fixed and frozen nature of the "stand pat" 
psychology, and to illustrate how applicable is 
its stereotyped verbiage to any questionings, 
wherever and whenever advanced, of the doctrine 
that Property is more sacred than Human Life.

INDIANS IN THE CIVIL WAR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of September 16, I note that your 
reviewer of Miss Abel's " Slave-Holding Indians 
in the Civil War " states that our remembrance of 
Albert Pike's Indians having fought at Pea Ridge 
and of General Grant having had an Indian on 
his staff is very nearly the sum of our information 
regarding the Indian in the Civil War. 

Pardon me, therefore, if I call your attention to 
the fact that a company of full-blooded Ottawa 
and Chippewa Indians from this section of North- 
ern Michigan, known as " Company K, First 
Michigan Sharpshooters," were in the service from 
January 12, 1863, until the close of the Civil War, 
and fought gallantly in many engagements in that 
bloody conflict. In view of their heroic sendee to 
the government, even after losing their lands, I 
regret exceedingly that history has not x been more 
liberal toward them. 

I have just published a little book regarding the 
manners and legends of these people. On page 88 
is a mention of the Indian company, and I possess 
its complete roster. J OHN c. WRIGHT.

THE ROMANTICISM OF FLAUBERT.* 

No historical period is so interesting as an 
age of transition. Renaissance or Revolu- 
tion there, in the conflict of opposing ten- 
dencies, the student finds his task and his 
reward. So, too, with literary types : no pure 
species, definite and definable, attracts like the 
transitional author, compelled by the accident 
of birth to serve a double ideal. Some writers 
reflect for us the spiritual struggles of an age. 
Such a type is Gustave Flaubert. Born in 
1821, at the very dawn of French Roman- 
ticism, he too is composing tragedies in the 
year that saw the thrice-memorable premiere 
of " Hernani/' At nine, he is already both 
author and actor, with his father's billiard- 
table for a stage! Five years later we find 
him sleeping with a poniard under his pil- 
low, a schoolboy Faust, talking of suicide in 
his letters and reconciled to life only by a 
historical romance which he is writing. Pure 
boyish bravado this, of course, but one does 
not smile at the Romantic despair which fills 
his correspondence and his first subjective 
novel: they tell too plainly the story of a 
malady grown real. Yet this youthful Byron 
lived to found the school of Realism, to create 
at one stroke its model and its chef d'muvre, 
" Madame Bovary." 

The case is unique in literature. At first 
sight, one might wonder at the Romanticism 
of an author who only made his debut in 1857, 
long after "Pere Goriot" and Musset's deri- 
sive " Lettres de Dupuis et Cotonet." But we 
forget the twenty-year apprenticeship that 
went to the making of "Madame Bovary." 
By 1842, when he attained his majority, Flau- 
bert had already written enough to fill two 
fat octavos : he had been writing for eight 
years, since his first school days at Rouen. 
Outside of Paris, the tide of literary theory 
has a slower ebb ; so we may see why his 
Juvenilia reflect nearly every phase of French 
Romanticism. 

Five years ago these " Oeuvres de Jeu- 
nesse " were at last published in toto by Co- 
nard. With them, too, appeared the collected 
correspondence, and it became possible to 
study the development of Flaubert from origi- 
nal sources. Here were letters dating from 
his ninth year, intimate letters filled with 
the enthusiasm of one who opened his heart

only to lovers of literature like himself. 
Hence the three scholarly monographs, from 
Johns Hopkins University, which invite us to 
consider the evolution and the literary meth- 
ods of this " Beethoven of French prose." 

The first of these studies takes up Flau- 
bert's 'prentice novels from his seventeenth to 
his twenty-fourth years. Up to seventeen his 
Juvenilia are almost entirely Romantic: the 
first volume of the " Oeuvres de Jeunesse " is 
ample evidence of his admiration for the his- 
torical novel, the historical drama, the sym- 
bolism of " Faust " and the violently macabre 
note of Gautier's early verse. But with all 
this, it contains a personal novel, "Les 
Memoires d'un Fou," inspired by Rousseau's 
" Confessions " and eloquent of the vital influ- 
ence of Rene's pessimism even in the late thir- 
ties. And Mr. Coleman's monograph gives us 
the parallels, notes the echoes of Byron, 
"Werther," Montaigne, Gautier, and others. 
None the less, the novel did spring from a 
real experience: here, in ten pages, we have 
the story of Flaubert's first passion, a hope- 
less boy-love for the lady who inspired his 
only sympathetic heroine, Madame Arnoux. 

" Les Memoires d'un Fou " date probably 
from 1838. Some four years later, Flaubert 
wrote another story in the " Confession " 
form. Like its predecessor, " Novembre " be- 
gins with a fugue of lyrical self-analysis ; but 
the Rene-note soon merges into a floridly re- 
alistic episode of carnal love chez une file. 
Externally the work would resemble Musset's 
"Rolla," did not the courtesan wax remi- 
niscent in turn, and prove herself like her 
lover a disappointed seeker after an ideal. 
All this, of course, is familiar to the Romantic 
formula, which may also be traced in the 
death of the hero after his disillusionment. 

Space forbids dwelling on the literary influ- 
ences, so carefully noted by Mr. Coleman. 
After Chateaubriand, it is "Mademoiselle de 
Maupin " which furnishes most of the parallel 
passages. The resemblance to "Rolla," re- 
marked by M. Descharmes in his earlier study, 
is proved inconclusive : Marie is seen to be a 
composite portrait of Gautier's ambiguous 
heroine and Rosette, while Flaubert's hero 
finds an elder brother in d' Albert. 

Both of these works are therefore typically 
Romantic. But in 1845 Flaubert completed 
another personal novel, begun two years be- 
fore, the first version of the " Education Sen- 
timentale." Now for the first time he studies 
the influence of love upon character : two 
friends, Romanticists both, pass through a 
" sentimental education " which shatters their 
illusions and turns them to objectivity. The 
history of Jules is not unlike that of Wilhelm

Meister ; but as Jules is Flaubert himself, one 
need only note the general inspiration. 
Traces of specific influence, moreover, become 
rarer ; at twenty-two Flaubert has found with 
experience larger powers of creation. Proof 
of this may be seen in the story of Jules's 
friend : for if we do find traces of Balzac and 
Musset, they are too slight to count. Flaubert 
is certainly working towards objectivity; his 
letters at. the time show him turning back to 
the great classics ; and his hero Jules, re-read- 
ing "Rene" and "Werther" and analyzing 
his admiration, finds in it "personal sym- 
pathy " and not " the disinterested contempla- 
tion of the true artist." Here, then, is the 
first statement of Flaubert's later creed. 

The evolution of the Realist is begun. At 
twenty-three Flaubert is already reacting 
from Romanticism. Does he owe this to 
Honore de Balzac? Mr. Coleman gives us 
many interesting parallels, but in the end 
ascribes the formulation of this new stand- 
point " to Flaubert himself, to his meditations, 
and perhaps to the lessons he drew from read- 
ing Shakespeare and La Bruyere." Thus he 
differs from M. Descharmes, who not having 
access to the unpublished " Education Senti- 
mentale," sets the reaction later and makes it 
largely the result of Flaubert's first attack of 
epilepsy. 

One would like to speak of the chapters 
which sum up the two sides of our author. 
But the monographs on " Salammbo " claim 
our attention, and we must sketch briefly the 
labors of the twelve years which intervene. 
For if Flaubert early foresaw and stated the 
Realistic theory, he could not subdue the lyrist 
that was in him. " Ce qui m'est naturel a moi, 
c'est le non-naturel pour les autres, 1'extraor- 
dinaire, le fantastique, la hurlade metaphy- 
sique, mythologique." And it is this lyrism 
which, through the next four years, flames up 
in the first version of his great philosophic 
allegory, " La Tentation de Saint Antoine." 

Things marvellous and mystical had always 
attracted him. When he first read "Faust," 
he told his niece, he " ceased to feel the earth 
beneath him." So at sixteen he wrote a long 
prose poem, "Reve d'Enfer," and two years 
later a still longer mystery-play, " Smarh," 
with Satan recast in a prominent role. In 
these precursors, rather than in Breughel's 
painting seen at Genoa, we find the begin- 
nings of the " Tentation." After two years 
of labor on a contemporary theme, Flaubert 
longed to escape from the Occident to the 
Orient, from the present to the exotic past. 

Might he not, perhaps, write a French 
"Faust"? "Ahasverus," to be sure, had 
proved a magnificent failure, Quinet's alle- 



gory being coldly received even in the cor- 
rected version of 1843. Yet the example was 
sufficient; and Flaubert, who loved to repeat 
Michelet's motto, "Nothing tempting but the 
Impossible," began the masterpiece of dream- 
literature on which he was to labor through 
twenty years. In his hands, the well-known 
legend becomes a monstrous vision, all modes 
of life and thought pass before him, a satur- 
nalia of philosophic systems, a mad proces- 
sional whose only lesson is the vanity of all 
things beneath the sun. How he read this 
stupendous phantasy to his friends Bouilhet 
and Ducamp, and how they told the indignant 
author to throw it into the fire and take a 
theme like " Cousine Bette," is told by Du- 
camp in his " Souvenirs litteraires " ; and by 
his testimony it was Bouilhet who, the next 
day, recalled to Flaubert the local incident 
which eight years later became "Madame 
Bovary." 

So Gustave Flaubert turned Realist. Out 
of the obscure physician's wife he created a 
world-type. Emma Bovary is not merely re- 
alistic ; she is more real than reality. She is 
not a woman, she is "Woman ; and her tragedy 
is the eternal tragedy of incapacity. All our 
modern life, with its blind democratic Titan- 
ism, is symbolized by that pathetic figure ; she 
reflects her century, typifies an age which lit- 
erature had spoiled for living. Like "Don 
Quixote " in the seventeenth century, she is a 
martyr to the Ideal, a victim of The Book, a 
martyr to all the poets who have added to the 
world's panoply of dreams. Too weak to 
fight Reality in that golden armor, she faints 
beneath the weight and fails, crushed down 
into the mire because the armor of her defence 
is not her own. 

"Madame Bovary" is the indictment of 
life against universal education. It is the 
indictment of Art against the theory of 
democracy. That characteristic of Roman- 
ticism, seen in its hatred of the bourgeois, 
was so essentially a reaction of Flaubert's cult 
of "Art for Art " that it is the obverse of his 
life-philosophy. But this aspect of " Madame 
Bovary" is lost in the larger significance of 
the novel, the miracle of its creation. What 
giant's will forged for us this cold analysis 
of human illusion, so typical that it has given 
the name to a philosophy?* A lyrist in a 
lyrical generation, foredoomed apparently to 
all the consequences of his Romantic, heritage, 
Flaubert rose through pure will above him- 
self, and carved his past sufferings into the 
masterpiece of modern realism. Like Cer- 
vantes, he "struck the death-blow to a false

ideal. But that ideal burned on like a banked 
fire in Gustave Flaubert, bursting out in 
the exoticism of " Salammbo," still smoulder- 
ing beneath the self-satire of "I/Education 
Sentimentale " and the bitter parody of 
"Bouvard et Pecuchet." Thus Romanticism 
is directly or indirectly the basis of all his 
work; like Zola later, Flaubert had "drunk 
too deeply of the Romantic brew." 

So after "Madame Bovary" came "Sa- 
lammbo." " I am going to write a novel whose 
action takes place three centuries before 
Christ," he writes in a letter of 1856. " I feel 
the need of getting out of this modern world, 
in which my pen has dipped too long, and 
which, moreover, tires me as much to repro- 
duce as it disgusts me to behold." So he 
turned back to the dreams of the past which 
had urged him on to the first prize in history 
at school. Then it was Hugo's Middle Ages 
or Stendhal's Renaissance that fired his ambi- 
tion; now, with that vein worked dry by a 
myriad of imitators, Gautier, and after him 
Flaubert, reverted to more distant and more 
exotic times. Not history, but archaeology 
now pointed the way, and Gautier had been 
quick to follow with his splendidly plastic 
classical and Egyptian tales. Why not, then, 
a Carthaginian romance? 

The task was certainly hard enough to be 
tempting even to Flaubert. He had, to be 
sure, the story of the mercenary war con- 
tained in the last few chapters of the First 
Book of Polybius. This he could follow, as 
indeed he did, for the characters and inci- 
dents of his military drama; he had only to 
add the love-interest by creating the figure of 
Salammbo. So he follows Polybius rather 
closely, as one may see in Mr. Fay's mono- 
graph; a bit careless of chronology because 
he is writing his novel scene by scene; but 
using everything and only occasionally sharp- 
ening the outlines of his model by greater 
precision of numerical detail. Still Polybius 
gave him scarcely more than an outline : to 
make his story real, to clothe his skeleton with 
flesh and muscle, he literally digested a classi- 
cal library. In two weeks, for instance, he 
"swallowed" to use his own expression 
the eighteen volumes of Cahen's translation 
of the Bible, with the notes, finding in them 
not a few precious details for costumes, 
musical instruments, architecture, and habits 
of life, which are brought together in Mr. 
Coleman's briefer study. But the mass of the 
material used is classical. Xenophon, JElian, 
Pausanias, Pliny, Silius Italicus, Strabo, 
Theophrastus, Herodotus, Appian, Plutarch, 
and the dusty ant-hill of modern archaeology 
must be ransacked ; one must be " stuffed with 



his subject up to the ears " to paint the " local 
color " which comes without effort and makes 
a book "exude reality." And Mr. Blossom 
sets forth, from Flaubert's correspondence, 
the Herculean labors which preceded and ac- 
companied the still more Herculean task of 
composition. The whole work was to take 
more than five years of constant toil, broken 
only by a trip to Africa required for further 
" documentation." 

This indefatigable patience, this pursuit of 
a truth no less scientific than artistic, reveal 
the realist in Flaubert. How a poet's dream, 
romantique s'il en fut jamais, was built into 
a plastic evocation of antiquity all the 
giant effort of materialization is shown in Mr. 
Blossom's pages. And if the finished " Sa- 
lammbo " leaves us cold, the story of its com- 
position reads like the work-filled letters of 
Balzac. Indeed, quite as strong a case might 
be made for Flaubert's Realism as for his 
innate Romanticism. Most critics have devel- 
oped one side or the other. After all, in these 
days of subjective criticism, the danger of the 
transitional type is the danger of the crystal

ELBA, WATERLOO, ST. HELEXA.* 

One consequence of " the Great War " seems 
certain, and that is a lessened interest in the 
figure of Napoleon and in his military achieve- 
ments. The epoch of modern warfare in 
which he was the unapproached master is now 
closed. The scale of action, the masses of 
men, the material resources, the means of 
destruction, the methods of transportation, 
everything sharply differentiates the present 
art of fighting from that of even the Napo- 
leonic past. Henceforward we shall study 
Napoleon as we study Hannibal, Caesar, or 
Gustavus. The books by Captain Becke and 
Mr. Norwood Young, fresh as they are from 
the presses, represent our attitude fifteen 
months ago, when they were brought to com- 
pletion, rather than that of to-day. This is 
not a disparagement ; it merely records a fact, 
or perhaps an impression. 

Books with such subjects Elba, Waterloo, 
St. Helena form a natural series. These 
volumes add solid contributions to the litera-

ture of these phases of Napoleon's career. 
Mr. Young's three volumes seem to be the 
most satisfactory and complete account of the 
two exiles. Captain Becke's volumes on the 
Waterloo campaign will appeal especially to 
readers interested in the problems of strategy 
and the management of armies in battle. The 
first volume, which carries the campaign up to 
June 18, contains more conclusions open to 
controversy than the second, which deals with 
the battle of Waterloo and the operations of 
Grouchy on June 18 and the days following. 

Captain Becke thinks that Napoleon "was 
no longer the Napoleon of Austerlitz; the sun 
still shone, but his power was waning visibly." 
One illustration of this loss of grasp was the 
manner of meeting the Prussian flank move- 
ment early on the afternoon of Waterloo. 
Captain Becke holds that it was a mistake to 
detach Count Lobau at that time to check 
Count Billow's advance. He argues that had 
Napoleon succeeded in breaking Wellington's 
line, the Prussians would have remained spec- 
tators. As it was, the Billow attack was not 
pressed for several hours after his corps was 
first sighted. Meanwhile Lobau was needed 
to support and complete D'Erlon's assault 
on Wellington's left. The gravest fault of 
Napoleon was, however, the day before, in the 
morning hours, when Wellington's army at 
Quatre Bras seemed to be at the mercy of the 
French had they brought into action troops 
not used the day before either at Quatre Bras 
or at Ligny. 

On the whole, Captain Becke is inclined to 
lay the principal blame for final failure upon 
Ney and Grouchy. This is especially true of 
the operations about Quatre Bras. His argu- 
ment that Ney should have been able to occupy 
Quatre Bras before noon on July 16 is not 
convincing. In the first place, Ney had no 
business to seize those cross-roads before he 
received specific orders, since a premature 
occupation of the British-Prussian line of 
inter-communication would probably, as Cap- 
tain Becke argues, have led Bliicher to fall 
back instead of fighting. The order to occupy 
Quatre Bras arrived at eleven. Secondly, it 
was materially impossible for Ney to get his 
wing of the army together before noon. Ac- 
cording to the careful calculations of the 
late Mr. Ropes, D'Erlon could reach the 
neighborhood of Quatre Bras only about 
three o'clock in the afternoon. Moreover, 
Keille, who was in command of the second 
corps, did not set out from Gosselies until a 
quarter before twelve, contrary to his under- 
standing with Ney. Captain Becke also fails 
to give Ney the benefit of the excuse that his 
orderlies had been collected hastily since his 



arrival at headquarters the day before and 
were not competent to put him in touch with 
various sections of his army. A fair reading 
of Napoleon's orders to Ney and to Grouchy 
shows that the unlucky marshals were not 
alone in failing to apprehend the true state 
of affairs. 

Captain Becke's discussion of Wellington's 
conduct is more judicial. He brings out the 
fact, hitherto not sufficiently emphasized, that 
Wellington would have been warned earlier 
of Napoleon's first moves had not the informa- 
tion sent to him on June 15 by Colonel Col- 
quhoun Grant, his trusted intelligence officer, 
stationed far in advance of the British out- 
posts, failed to reach him until the very morn- 
ing of Waterloo. But Captain Becke points 
out that Wellington more than made up for 
his faults of strategy by splendid defensive 
fighting both at Quatre Bras and at Waterloo. 

Mr. Norwood Young's books distinguish 
themselves from those of some of his predeces- 
sors on the same theme by an entire absence 
of false sentiment, polemics, and rhetoric. 
The unadorned tale, carefully documented, 
requires no adventitious aids to stimulate in- 
terest. The author is not unappreciative of 
the painful situation of Napoleon, which may 
excuse much of the ill-temper which the ex- 
Emperor displayed, but this does not lead him 
into unjust criticisms of the men whose dis- 
agreeable task it was to see that Napoleon 
remained secure on the island of St. Helena. 

Mr. Young believes that as Napoleon had 
succeeded in hoodwinking Neil Campbell, the 
British commissioner at Elba, he was espe- 
cially chagrined to find that neither Cockburn 
nor Lowe could be duped. Napoleon seems 
actually to have become obsessed by the idea 
that Lowe had been sent to St. Helena to make 
way with him. The fundamental difficulty, 
however, was that the British pursued a mid- 
dle course with Napoleon, treating him as a 
guest under restraint and expecting him to 
accept the part with equanimity. It seems 
silly to have refused him the title of Emperor, 
although, as Mr. Young remarks, the English 
had never formally recognized his sovereignty. 
They had, nevertheless, attempted to negotiate 
peace with him in 1807, which was a virtual 
recognition of his rule. In 1814 they had 
also, as allies of the signatories of the Treaty 
of Fontainebleau, agreed that he should re- 
tain the imperial title. Their main , concern 
was not his assumption of an imperial status, 
but the security of his person. The conditions 
which they imposed went far toward render- 
ing Lowe's task impossible. 

There are lighter sides to the Elba sojourn, 
and even the exile at St. Helena was not all

sombre. Napoleon's companions were a 
strange lot. Mr. Young carefully delineates 
each of them. Occasionally a single sentence 
gives an amusing glimpse of a personage. 
For example, of Piontkowski the author re- 
marks : " To be associated with the Emperor, 
and to be free from pecuniary anxieties, was 
for him a wonderful fortune." In other 
cases an anecdote accomplishes the same pur- 
pose. It appears that Montchenu, the French 
commissioner, was in the habit of accepting 
invitations and offering no return, which 
earned him the name of the "Marquis de 
Montez-chez-nous. " 

In the chapter on " Finance " at Elba, Mr. 
Young gives figures to demonstrate that, 
although the French government did not pay 
the two million francs stipulated, Napoleon 
had money enough to maintain his establish- 
ment not only through 1815 but also through 
1816 and 1817. If this was the case, the rapid 
shrinkage of his financial resources was not, 
as has been supposed, one cause of his return 
to France. 

The descriptions of both Elba and St. 
Helena are based upon the author's careful 
examination of every feature of the islands. 
The interest of the narrative is much en- 
hanced by the many illustrations drawn from 
the rich collections of Mr. A. M. Broadley.

FRAGMENTA SHAKESPEAREANA.* 

Of the thirty periodical essays on Shake- 
spearean subjects by Mrs. C. C. Stopes, now 
reprinted in book form, a few are well worth 
preservation between the covers of an easily 
accessible volume ; the others might as well 
or better have been left buried in the period- 
icals where they first saw the light. Mrs. 
Stopes's book, which would much more appro- 
priately have been entitled " Elizabethan and 
Shakespearean Fragments," adds very little 
if anything of value to our stock of dry 
facts concerning Shakespeare and his family. 
The chapter dealing with Asbies, Mary Ar- 
den's inheritance, does not clear up the mys- 
tery surrounding that estate; but it enables 
Mrs. Stopes to bring out a new detail in John 
Shakespeare's life, namely, that about 1580 he 
was fined forty pounds because of two law- 
suits in which he was involved. Mrs. Stopes 
fails to see the relevance of this " fact " to the 
question of John's fortunes. Like all the 
biographers of the greatest of Elizabethan 
poets, she too accepts the theory that John 

* SHAKESPEARE'S ENVIRONMENT. By Mrs. C. C. Stopes. New 
York : The Macmillan Co. 



had become poor and indigent about the time 
of the Asbies mortgage; although a careful 
examination of all the facts now known to us 
leaves no doubt that John's misfortunes have 
been enormously and grotesquely exaggerated. 
A broken bankrupt would not have been ac- 
cepted, as John was, as surety in the Queen's 
Court at Westminster and elsewhere. That 
the Shakespeares ever suffered from poverty 
is a fable. 

Mrs. Stopes has to her credit the discovery 
of the facts that in 1595 a "Mr. Shaxpere" 
of Stratford, perhaps it was John, was in- 
debted to one " Jone Perat " for " one book " ; 
and that at some time or other a "Maria 
Shaxpere," who may have been the poet's 
mother, was in some way connected with a law- 
suit. The statement that John lost his money 
" through some folly " is no more absurd or 
better founded than the conjecture that Will- 
iam "learnt some of his knowledge of law 
terms from the experience of his mother" in 
the suit referred to. Equally questionable is 
the value of the discovery that the much- 
tortured word " honorificabilitudinitatibus," 
which occurs in " Love's Labour's Lost " and 
in the mysterious Northumberland MS., is also 
to be found scribbled in a mid-sixteenth cen- 
tury hand in the registers of Pillerton Hersy, 
a town in Warwickshire, "a locality where 
the book and the writer were quite accessible 
to Shakspeare." Mrs. Stopes also claims credit 
for the discovery that, contrary to the general 
opinion, Queen Bess had in her service pro- 
fessional Fools and even women Fools. 

Much more value attaches to her discovery 
that in Ingleby's photographic facsimile of 
the Diary of Thomas Greene, one page had 
been placed out of its order, and that conse- 
quently Ingleby drew a wrong inference in 
the matter of the Welcombe Enclosures. Many 
Shakespeareans will appreciate the reproduc- 
tion of some of the correspondence of those 
concerned in the restoration of the Shake- 
speare Bust in 1748. The chapter on Bur- 
bage's " Theatre " is of interest only because 
it was expanded into a volume called "Bur- 
bage and Shakespeare's Stage," and because 
of a postscript in which Mrs. Stopes attempts, 
more malevolently than successfully, to claim 
for herself the discovery of many of the docu- 
ments pertaining to the " Theatre," thus 
denying Professor Wallace's claim to priority 
in this matter. Her chapter on " The Friends 
in Shakespeare's Sonnets " is one of the worst 
essays on those unfortunate poems we have 
ever read. Any critic who interprets, as Mrs. 
Stopes does, the word " passion " in the locu- 
tion, " The master-mistress of my passion," as 
meaning "sonnet," or who is satisfied to accept

Mrs. Jacquinetta Field, the wife of Shake- 
speare's friend, as the Dark Lady for no bet- 
ter reason than that " she was a Frenchwoman 
and therefore likely to have dark eyes, a sallow 
complexion, and that indefinable charm so 
much alluded to," is fit for treasons, strata- 
gems, and spoils, and is not to be trusted as 
a guide to Shakespeare. This is the kind of 
stuff on which Baconians feed fat. When it 
comes to making all sorts of rambling, im- 
probable., and improvable assertions concern- 
ing Shakespeare, Mrs. Stopes knows no limit. 
If there is any one thing that mars all her 
work, that takes all worth from her right 
copious industry, it is her want of the scien- 
tific temper, the desire for the truth for the 
truth's sake. She makes up her mind to what 
she wants to prove, and then twists all the 
facts around to her theory-, and when facts 
fail her she resorts to conjecture and guess- 
work. When Shakespeare commentators reach 
this stage of mental astigmatism, there is no 
arguing with them. They use such phrases 
as " it is clear," " it is probable," " there is 
no doubt," etc., without the slightest warrant, 
and with apparently not the slightest idea of 
the meaning of the words they employ. 

Our readers may recall a discovery made 
recently by Mr. Stevenson showing that in 
1613 "Mr. Shakspeare" was paid forty-four 
shillings in gold for having devised an im- 
prese or heraldic device for the Earl of Rut- 
land. For various good and sufficient reasons, 
which need not be repeated here, Shakespeare 
students are agreed that this " Mr. Shak- 
speare " was our poet. But Mrs. Stopes does 
not think it consonant with the dignity of a 
great poet to earn money in this fashion, 
and she proceeds to throw doubt on the iden- 
tification. She finds that there dwelt in Lon- 
don a bit-maker named John Shakspeare who 
might ( !) have been called "Mr." by the Stew- 
ard of Belvoir Castle and who was "probably" 
(possibly?) master of the Lariners Company. 
After regaling us with extracts from the ac- 
counts of various noblemen, in all of which 
the bit-maker is spoken of as "John Shak- 
speare," Mrs. Stopes concludes that she has 
proved that there was another contemporary 
and well-to-do "Mr. Shakspeare" in court 
service who might have been the person re- 
ferred to in the Belvoir accounts. As a mat- 
ter of fact, the extracts quoted by her prove 
nothing of the sort. Shakspeare the bit- 
maker is never given the appellation "Mr." 
in the accounts she quotes, and we have there- 
fore no reason for assuming that it was he 
who was associated with Richard Burbage in 
devising an emblem for the Earl of Rutland. 
A phycho-analyst would find it difficult not to 



conclude that Mrs. Stopes's defective logic is 
due to an overwhelming desire to belittle the 
discoveries of others and to magnify the im- 
portance of her own. 

The latter tendency is strikingly, if uncon- 
sciously, manifested in Mrs. Stopes's chapter 
on the "True Story of the Stratford Bust." 
As luck would have it, our author (re-) discov- 
ered that Dugdale's " History of the Antiqui- 
ties of Warwickshire" contains an engraving 
of the Stratford Bust which differs in certain 
details from the bust as we know it, and 
which had "been entirely ignored by all" 
Shakespeare students (except Halliwell-Phil- 
lipps, she might have added), although it is 
the earliest known engraving of the bust. In 
her enthusiasm over her discovery, Mrs. 
Stopes goes into raptures over the fact that 
in Dugdale's drawing the poet has " large and 
full dark eyes," hollow and emaciated cheeks, 
a softly-drooping (instead of a "perky") 
moustache, lacks the conventional sign-post 
pen, wants the familiar mantle, and is free 
from the "plump earthliness" of the bust. 
She finds in this engraving " the tired creator 
of poems, exhausted from lack of sleep," and 
boldly and falsely asserts that "it dif- 
fers in all important details from the bust as 
it appears now." The differences between the 
bust and the drawing can be explained only 
in one of two ways: either Dugdale and his 
engraver were careless in the representation 
of the tomb, or the tomb was altered and 
remodelled after the publication of Dugdale's 
work. Mrs. Stopes, as might be guessed, 
adopts the latter view because it heightens the 
importance of her discovery. Quite in keep- 
ing with this tendency, she exaggerates the 
imperfections of the bust, and the differences 
between the bust and the engraving, credits 
Dugdale with painstaking care in his work 
(although she is forced to admit after read- 
ing Andrew Lang's criticism of her essay he 
" was no artist " and " was careless as to insig- 
nificant details," and "made no attempt at 
accurate reproduction of the expression of the 
human countenance"), magnifies and misrep- 
resents the repairs of the bust made under 
Ward's direction in 1748 (there is no war- 
rant for the assertion that the bust was " sub- 
mitted to the moulder's mercenary hands " or 
that it was reconstructed), and strips the 
Droeshout and Chandos portraits of their 
value as fairly authentic presentments of the 
poet. To further bolster up the significance 
of her find, she asserts as "quite possible" 
that Dugdale saw Shakespeare in the flesh, 
but she omits to say that Dugdale was only 
ten and one-half years old when the poet died, 
and was not a resident of Stratford. If all

that Mrs. Stopes says were true, Dugdale's 
engraving would be a portrait of Shakespeare 
of the first importance. But Dugdale is not 
a reliable guide to the antiquities of Warwick- 
shire, as a comparison of his illustrations with 
modern photographs of these antiquities will 
show. Sir George Trevelyan has pointed out 
that Dugdale's Carew Clopton Monument is 
even more inaccurate than his Shakespeare 
Monument, which seems to have been roughly 
and inexactly sketched for him or by him and 
subsequently elaborated by his draughtsman 
or engraver in accordance with the dictates 
of his fancy. Mrs. Stopes admits that Dug- 
dale's rough sketch, in his diary, shows the 
mantle, though the engraving in his book does 
not. The failure to reproduce Dugdale's 
sketch for comparison with the engraving is 
a suspicious circumstance, as is also the omis- 
sion of photographs of the monument and of 
the engraving. These illustrations would not 
have added greatly to the cost of the book, 
and the readers would then be in a position to 
judge for themselves. As a matter of fact, 
the differences between the bust and monu- 
ment and the engraving are such as result 
from the indifferent workmanship of an un- 
skilled and careless draughtsman, and sucn as 
to leave no doubt that there was no attempt at 
exactness in the reproduction. 

As for the rest of the book, with the excep- 
tion of the really commendable chapter on the 
poet's maternal ancestry, it is too full of 
romancing to have any value as biography. 
Those who are not too particular about scien- 
tific exactness will find this a rather readable 
and fairly well written volume of odds and 
ends about Shakespeare and his times. It 
may not be an unfitting close to this review 
to mention that the very first page of Mrs. 
Stopes's introductory chapter contains a 
wholly inexcusable misquotation from " Ham- 
let" (" There's a divinity doth shape our ends 
Rough hew them as we will ") which is sym- 
bolic of the unscientific method characteristic 
of this author's work.

BUDDHIST PSYCHOLOGY.* 

Like the psychology of Europe, Buddhist 
psychology is a growth, the result of a slow 
development through the centuries. Euro- 
pean psychology, however, presents some 
cataclysmic changes, such as those from 
paganism to Christianity and from supersti- 
tion to the scientific analysis of mind. This 
is not the case with Buddhist thought, 

* BUDDHIST PSYCHOLOGY. By Mrs. C. A. F. Rhys-Davids. 
" The Quest Series." New York : The Macmillan Co. 



there is quiet and continuous growth from the 
earliest to the latest writings. 

Again, just as early European psychology 
is embedded in a larger body of philosophic 
doctrine, so this Buddhist psychology must 
be selected piecemeal from the philosophy 
through which psychological observations are 
scattered. These observations appear, how- 
ever, to be fundamental to the philosophy of 
the Orient, and incidental (or almost inci- 
dental) to that of Europe. In both cases, 
moreover, ethics seems to be the chief aim of 
the philosophic thought. 

To the above three rough similarities 
(grounded, perhaps, in the very nature of 
the human mind and its development) we 
may add a prime difference. The Buddhist 
thinkers did not begin with universals, but 
with more specific and concrete concepts of 
psychology. The chief categories are: (1) 
chitta, or consciousness; (2) chetasika, lit- 
erally mental things, or "mentals"; (3) 
rupa, visible form, material quality; and (4) 
nibbana (nirvana), the ultimate good, or 
summum bonum. 

The Buddhist concept of consciousness is 
far more extensive and pantheistic than our 
notion of personal consciousness. It includes 
the universe of being, from the infra-human 
through both inferior and superior celestial 
worlds. As is well known, Buddhist philoso- 
phy teaches that by sedulous exercise in con- 
templation " mundane consciousness might be 
temporarily transformed into consciousness 
experienced in either the less material or the 
quite immaterial worlds." Chitta is the name 
for this all-pervading consciousness, cheta- 
sika for its phases or factors ; though the logic 
of whole and part is not emphatic in Budd- 
hist thought, for it is a philosophy of the 
continuum. This pantheistic consciousness 
either "happens" in living individuals or 
is envisaged in them, and one of the most 
important attributes of consciousness is its 
badness or goodness. Hence ethics becomes 
an essential part of Buddhist psychology. 

The fleeting "impermanent" character of 
the stream of thought and experience is con- 
trasted with the more permanent human body 
in the earlier Buddhist writings. In later 
exegesis of this concept the mind is an " inter- 
mittent manifestation happening only in re- 
action to a suitable stimulus." Consequently 
there is visual, auditory, and other sensational 
consciousness "just as fire is different ac- 
cording to the kind of fuel." 

Besides the word chitta for mind or intelli- 
gence, the word vinnana, almost the equiva- 
lent of our word " soul," was also used. The 
Buddhist notion of the genesis of individual 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



323 



consciousness may then be inferred from the 
following quotation: "Were vinnana, An- 
anda, not to descend into the mother's womb, 
would body and mind become constituted 
therein ? " There are also terms for the self, 
and for mental and bodily life as combined in 
one individual. The self is also doubled in 
ethical passages, as in our term " self-accusa- 
tion," etc. Finally, self-analysis is valued as 
a means of self-mastery. 

Man is an " impermanent compound," with 
no unity save that conferred by the name, 
and he is capable of looking either into sense 
impressions or into spiritual impressions, in- 
cluding what may be called supernormal 
experience. 

The account of consciousness in Mrs. Rhys- 
Davids's little book, from which we derive 
the foregoing summary, includes discussions 
of the following: (1) stimuli, or "those mate- 
rial qualities" from which the individual 
receives sense impressions; (2) feeling (in- 
cluding the "feeling-tone" of sensations), it 
being of interest to note that the existence of 
neutral or indifferent feelings is claimed; (3) 
perception, which includes both sense-percep- 
tion and the perception of meaning and rela- 
tions; (4) thought or mental elaboration, 
later on volition seeming to have been in- 
cluded in this "compound"; (5) conscious- 
ness in general (vinnana), including the 
already-mentioned genetic consciousness. 

The reader will doubtless be surprised to 
find the fifth general notion, of which the 
preceding four are for us subdivisions, made 
coordinate with those four. This is accounted 
for by " the absence in the Buddhist tradition 
of any cogent logic of division by way of 
genus and species," and "an emphatic nega- 
tion of any substantial unity in vinnana." 
" To see further separateness would be, wrote 
Buddhgahosa, 'as if one drew water at the 
delta where the five rivers enter the sea say- 
ing : " This is Ganges water ; this is Jumna 
water." ' "All these mental states are one 
with respect to their object." Vinnana in 
this phase of its meaning is almost the equiva- 
lent of our word " awareness." 

No psychophysical theory of sensation, in 
the modern meaning, appears in Buddhist 
psychology ; yet the senses are discussed with 
the dominant place always given to sight and 
colors. The division of labor between the 
senses is also noted. In the heart, or seat of 
the mind, the senses become one, according to 
the early disciples of Buddha, though this 
idea is not to be found in the teachings of the 
Founder himself. 

Human emotions may be said to have begun 
only yesterday to yield to scientific analysis. 



Little wonder, then, that Buddhist psychology 
describes only sense-feeling, and includes in 
this term " not well," " ills and pains of body, 
ills and misery of mind, in a word, dis-ease." 

The analysis of intellectual processes is not 
carried far in the older books. Our every-day 
terms, perception, opinion, volition, wish, 
aspiration, remembering, comparing, discern- 
ing, etc., are used, and give a hint as to the 
stage which analysis had reached. 

The chief aim of the Buddhist disciples was 
to teach how to practise the exercises which 
helped toward the " emancipation of heart 
and mind from all hindrances and fetters ad- 
verse to spiritual perfection." The directions 
for auto-suggestion and the attainment of the 
trance-consciousness are excellent. Perhaps 
those in search of a rest cure for overwrought 
minds will find this portion of Mrs. Ehys- 
Davids's book the most valuable. 

Such in briefest outline is the psychology 
of the Buddhist books regarded as the earliest 
ones. Later writings made further advances 
in the study of the mind. Yet viewed from 
the standpoint of the sharp discrimination 
and keen analysis of modern psychology, this 
very ancient discussion reminds us of one who 
"sees through a glass darkly." This re- 
minder, however, comes when one reads any 
chapter of ancient psychology. Perhaps that 
is the best "exercise" to teach us how much 
labor our modern psychology has cost.

A DIVIXE VISIONARY.* 



"Your affectionate, enthusiastic, hope- 
fostered visionary, William Blake." Thus, 
in the conclusion of a letter to Hayley, Blake 
describes himself; and it would be hard to 
find more apt words of denomination. Add 
to them that Blake was one of the greatest 
artists in lyric verse that the world has ever 
known, and that he was nevertheless sepa- 
rated from communication with men by an 
impenetrable wall of curious mysticism that 
almost ruined his art, and you do very fair 
justice to Blake as a poet. 

Just because the larger part of Blake's work 
is so nearly an unintelligible ruin. Dr. Fred- 
erick E. Pierce has performed an especially 
valuable service in issuing his " Selections 
from the Symbolical Poems of William 'Blake." 
Blake's exquisite lyrics are known to every- 
one; but his "Prophetic Books" are so in-

humanly repellent that not a hundred persons 
in a decade ever read them. It is as easy to 
penetrate into a virgin jungle as to venture 
into them; the labor is enormous and the 
reward doubtful. Professor Pierce, by sepa- 
rating from the great mass of Blake's chaotic 
writings certain of the more coherent portions, 
has produced an attractive volume that will 
allure many a reader who would flee from the 
complete " Prophetic Books " in dismay. Per- 
haps such a reader may, even after making 
the attempt which this book facilitates, turn 
back hopeless and revert to those simple and 
subtle lyrics in which Blake shows himself an 
unquestionable master of beauty; but he will 
at least have had the satisfaction of partially 
soothing a conscience that may well hesitate 
to regard as negligible even the maddest work 
of a mind that could sometimes sing thus : 

" Thou the golden fruit dost bear, 
I am clad in flowers fair; 
Thy sweet boughs perfume the air, 
And 'the turtle buildeth there. 

" There she sits and feeds her young, 
Sweet I hear her mournful song ; 
And thy lovely leaves among, 
There is love, I hear his tongue." 

Swinburne, great metrist that he was, chose 
this passage out for special admiration ; and, 
indeed, there stirs everywhere through the 
lines a high aerial vibrancy, an auroral flush 
of music, that rises into regions never touched 
by Swinburne's own superb but earthly tides 
of sound. 

No one has ever really understood the whole 
of Blake's "Prophetic Books." Swinburne's 
generous enthusiasm, called into being by the 
indisputable greatness of the lyrics, led him 
somehow to believe that he was able to fathom 
the longer poems also ; and Mr. Yeats, influ- 
enced by his preoccupation with mysticism, 
has tried to make himself think that he can 
thread his way through these labyrinths. But 
neither one of them is very clear in his report 
of what he has seen in this cloudy nether- 
world; and it is not necessary for us to 
imagine that either one saw very much more 
than we see. For though Blake rose some- 
times to lyrical heights from which he could 
have looked Milton and Shelley straight and 
level in the eyes, he sometimes sank to depths 
of intellectual confusion where he was below 
the eye-level of the maddest street-corner 
prophet. No great genius was ever more 
unequal than he. He wrote, on occasion, in 
terms so simple as to be universal, and at 
other moments in wild mythological images so 
complex and private as to be literally incom- 
prehensible. 



To get anything from the "Prophetic 
Books," one must first of all put them aside 
and attempt to understand Blake himself. 
Visionary and mystic though he was, he did 
not differ from ordinary men so much in the 
quality of his mental state as in the con- 
sistency with which he preserved a mental 
state that is for most men a very fleeting one. 
To the dullest of us come rare keen moments 
when in the glow of some sunrise the material 
phenomena of earth and sun are obliterated 
by the overwhelming spirit of flaming joy and 
new creation that cries out of that dawn ; and 
for every man who has ever lived, the phy- 
sical vesture of some woman has in a magic 
hour dissolved to nothing and left him staring 
into the spiritual Eden of a world beyond. 
But for most minds, these are passing moods ; 
for most minds, the external signals by which 
the world makes itself known to our con- 
sciousnesses are the final verities. To Blake 
they were never verities. He forgot them as 
we habitually forget the alphabet through 
whose agency we read ; he passed immediately 
beyond them to touch lovingly the significant 
soul of beauty which was adumbrated to him 
by the phenomena of life's episodes. In the 
clearest piece of self-analysis he ever uttered, 
he writes : 

" I assert for myself that I do not behold the 
outward creation, and that to me it is a hinder- 
ance and not action. ' What ! ' it will be ques- 
tioned, ' when the sun rises, do you not see a round 
disc of fire somewhat like a guinea? ' Oh ! no, no ! 
I see an innumerable company of the heavenly 
host, crying ' Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God 
Almighty ! ' I question not with my corporeal eye 
any more than I would question a window concern- 
ing sight. I look through it and not with it." 

Some such power as that, penetrating 
through commonplace phenomena to the more 
significant essences that lie behind them, is 
the very life-blood of poetical imagination; 
and though Blake was far from being the 
greatest of the poets, it may be doubted 
whether any human being has ever had a 
more intense light of poetry in his soul. What 
Blake lacked was a cold calculating architec- 
tural intellect; and he left no single edifice 
that can be spoken of in the same breath with 
those of Milton and Shelley, who are in other 
ways his spiritual peers. Rather, his work 
is like a series of half-ruined Gothic windows, 
sometimes mere fragments of glowing mosaic ; 
but through them pours a light tinged with 
such unearthly splendor that, in certain 
moods, one asks for nothing more. He was a 
great craftsman, often, in these fragments; 
and it is a well selected group of the frag- 
ments that Professor Pierce has brought 
together. 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



325 



These selections will give to a reader un- 
familiar with the whole of Blake's work an 
impression of greater lucidity than is wholly 
accurate or w r holly fortunate. Professor Pierce 
would doubtless be the first to acknowledge 
that his attempt, while it will win Blake 
many new readers, does on the other hand 
diminish the chaotic and cloudy grandeur of 
Blake's wild universe without greatly abating 
its fundamental preposterousness. The selec- 
tions try to show in decent sequence the chief 
elements of Blake's mythological system; but 
this system is the one thing in the " Prophetic 
Books " that is quite negligible for sane men. 
Blake was by no means the profound and 
Platonean mind that some of his admirers 
think him. He was simply the wreck of a 
great artist. Those purgatorial visions, those 
volcanic fragments of thought, which in him 
too often take the place of really intelligent 
cerebration, he clothed in music and light- 
ning; and they issued forth with a splendor 
that is dazzling and misleading. Unable to 
subdue these sub-rational fever-hallucinations 
to the discipline of any intelligible order or 
even to the requirements of communicable 
expression, he created out of them a fictitious 
world of phantasmagoria, filled with names 
and symbols of arbitrary and indecipherable 
meaning. 

Mr. Yeats would doubtless damn to the pit 
a critic who chose to admit that he found the 
" Prophetic Books " chaotically unintelligible ; 
but Gilchrist, the devoted and sympathetic 
biographer of Blake, was forced to confess in 
his day that he believed them to be "inco- 
herent rhapsodies, . . a perplexed region of 
morbid analogy." These symbolic poems, in 
spite of all their interest, are failures; for 
art is expression, and these do not achieve 
expressiveness. One cannot properly quarrel 
with Blake for the mystical unreality of his 
conceptions; but we may justly blame him 
for his neglect to embody these conceptiops in 
a form capable of conveying the vision to us. 
It is a pure case of insufficient artistic con- 
science; the visionary who wrote "Vala," 
" Milton," and " Jerusalem " has overwhelmed 
the artist who wrote "The Tiger," and left 
him stammering in solitary darkness.

RECEXT PLAYS OF WAR AND TJOVE.* 



Like the rest of us, the dramatists cannot 
get away from the war ; and like us, they can- 
not find much that is new to say about it. 
Alas, that "bromides" taste no fresher for 
being prescribed by a celebrated doctor! 
Timeliness and a great name did not avail to 
give Sir James Barrie's "Der Tag" success 
on the stage; and for reading, too, it is a 
futile and unimpressive piece of work. The 
fact is that Barrie's genius is no better 
adapted to heroics than is that of his best 
known American interpreter. Mr. Alfred 
Noyes's "A Belgian Christmas Eve" reads a 
good deal better. It is a new version of 
" Rada," Mr. Noyes's one-act play of the 
Balkan War, with the scene changed from 
Servia to Belgium. Dramatically and as a 
protest against war, "A Belgian Christmas 
Eve" is much less effective than the Amer- 
ican war play, "Across the Border " (reviewed 
in THE DIAL of August 15). As a play- 
wright, Mr. Noyes has not fully mastered his 
technique; and the flavor of partisanship, 
from which the American play is kept scrupu- 
lously free, weakens the moral effect of the 
piece. Nevertheless, Mr. Noyes tells an ap- 
pealing story ; and his verse, one need hardly 
add, is vigorous and at times imaginative. Its 
fault, as usual, is a fatal fluency. Mr. Noyes 
seldom knows when to stop. Thus his epi- 
logue, beginning with the fine stanza quoted 
below, trails off into prolixity and weakness. 
" Now the muttering gun-fire dies,

vagueness and repetition of his earlier man- 
ner. A speech or two will serve as a sample : 

"Jeanne. But I cannot, Emil. What is it? I 
cannot understand. What is it? Where are we? 
My God, I don't understand anything. I used to 
understand, I used to understand, but now 
Where is Pierre? [Firmly] Where is Pierre? 

" Maurice. Oh, will he be here soon ? Mother 
dear, we'll start in a moment. 

" Jeanne. Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment. But 
I don't understand anything. Where are we? 
Why such a dream? Why such a dream? I can't 
understand. Who has come? My head is aching. 
Who has come ? Why has it happened ? " 
By this recipe, dramatic dialogue is indeed 
easy to write. Of Maeterlinck's imaginative 
uplift and spiritual insight the play has not 
a trace. 

Far more effective than these new pieces, 
even as a plea for the Belgium of to-day, is 
Sardou's powerful melodrama of the days of 
William the Silent, "Patrie." First per- 
formed in 1869, this play now appears for the 
first time in English, admirably translated for 
" The Drama League Series " by Mr. Barrett 
H. Clark. In his Introduction, Mr. Clark 
sensibly protests against the modern ten- 
dency to ridicule Sardou and the " well made 
play," for which Mr. Bernard Shaw set the 
fashion with his jests at " Sardoodledom." So 
far as this tendency represents a reaction 
against a standardized and machine-made 
form of play, it is wholesome ; yet a machine- 
made form is infinitely better than no form at 
all, as anyone who reads " The Sorrows of 
Belgium" or Gorki's "Submerged" (noticed 
below) will heartily testify. "Patrie" tells 
the story of the Count de Rysoor, a heroic 
Flemish patriot who with the help of William 
of Orange nearly succeeds in delivering Brus- 
sels from the cruel militaristic control of the 
Duke of Alva. The play is crowded with action, 
like a Shakespearean tragi-comedy ; its mate- 
rial is intensely dramatic, and is presented 
with the brilliance and skill of a great master 
of his craft. Beside the broad sweep of its 
action, its vivid and masculine force, most of 
the little modern " dramas of ideas " seem the 
peevish whinings of an invalid. 

For example, consider " The State For- 
bids," a little tract in dialogue which scatters 



its fire of complaints among various supposed 
abuses, including war. The State forbids the 
doctor to inform the drunkard's wife how to 
avoid having children; when the idiot child 
is born, the State forbids its mother or the 
doctor to kill it ; and finally the State through 
conscription takes away from the mother her 
only strong and intelligent son. Her conclu- 
sion, requiring no comment, is "Damn the 
State ! " In the reviewer's opinion, the only 
one of these complaints which has any justifi- 
cation is the first, and it is obvious that this 
cannot be satisfactorily treated in drama. 

A much stronger example of the play with 
a thesis is Miss Crothers's "A Man's World." 
The central idea is that a woman who believes 
in a single standard of sex morality should 
not marry a man who has lived in accordance 
with the " double standard." The plot is 
carefully constructed to fit this doctrine. The 
heroine, "Frank" "Ware, a successful writer, 
has adopted the illegitimate son of an Amer- 
ican girl who died when the child was born, 
in Paris. As her love for the adopted 
" Kiddie " has grown, her hate of his unknown 
father has kept pace with it. When through 
an ancient but skilfully handled dramatic 
device, she learns that the man with whom she 
is in love is " Kiddie's " father, her problem is 
before her. Here is the weak spot in the 
play. The author is determined that the hero- 
ine shall act consistently with her theory and 
reject her lover; but in order to make this 
plausible on the stage, it was necessary to 
violate all plausibility in another matter, and 
to sacrifice the consistency of the lover's char- 
acter. He is represented as a masterful and 
rather unscrupulous man of the world, much 
in love with Frank. Yet when she makes it 
perfectly plain that she would instantly ac- 
cept him if he showed the slightest sign of 
repentance, he suddenly develops a strain of 
scrupulous and unseasonable truthfulness 
which enables her to reject him. In spite of 
this weakness, the play is in general well 
planned, and in so far deserves its success on 
the stage. In style and characterization, how- 
ever, it is decidedly crude. 

Whatever may be thought of Gorki's " Sub- 
merged," it cannot be accused of having a 
thesis. " These plays," the writer of the 
Introduction tells us, "pass the test of all 
supreme art; they are slices of life." With- 
out commenting on the things which the " test 
of supreme art" would exclude, one may re- 
mark that this particular " slice of life " is cut 
from the toughest part of the rump. The 
scene is a Russian lodging house of the lowest 
type, an eddy into which the scum of human- 
ity has drifted. In this filthy hole appears

Luka, an aged pilgrim, and for a short time 
he brings a little kindness into the lives of 
the wretches who live there. Then for no 
apparent reason he disappears, and the in- 
habitants sink back to an even lower level 
than that on which they lived before his com- 
ing. The play is confusing to read on account 
of the large number of characters and the 
multiplicity of Russian nicknames. In this 
respect, at least, the translator would appear 
to have done his work rather badly. 

Of the three plays of Maurice Donnay 
translated by Mr. Barrett H. Clark for " The 
Modern Drama Series" two, as is usual with 
Donnay, are concerned entirely with illicit 
sex relations. In " Lovers " and " The Free 
Woman " we are in a world where informal 
and temporary relations are the regular thing. 
" Lovers " opens, as one of Clyde Fitch's plays 
does, with a children's party; but the moth- 
ers of these hopeful families are all unmar- 
ried. Claudine R-ozay, who gives the party 
for her little daughter, has been for years the 
mistress of the Count de Ruyseux. Vetheuil, 
the other man who gains her affections, be- 
comes dissatisfied because she will not break 
with the count and live with him openly. She 
is perfectly willing to be unfaithful to the 
count in secret, but for the sake of their 
daughter she refuses to leave him altogether. 
After a time Vetheuil can endure this no 
longer; in spite of tears and storms he goes 
off on an exploring expedition to Indo-China, 
and on his return marries. Meanwhile, Ruy- 
seux' wife having died, Claudine reconciles 
herself to marriage with her old lover. The 
title of " The Free Woman " is ironical. 
Antonia, like Claudine, enters on another 
intrigue while still the mistress of Roger 
Lembrun ; but he, a man of considerable char- 
acter, discovers her infidelity and discards 
her. A sub-plot emphasizes the point of 
the play: that people in irregular unions 
("free") are really in a double bondage to 
their lovers and to their own passions. Both 
plays, it need hardly be said, are well con- 
structed, and the characters are analyzed and 
discriminated with skill. The translation ap- 
pears to be excellent; but it is hard to see 
what good purpose is served by putting 
French plays of this type into English at all. 
If they are widely read, it will be not because 
of their literary merit, but because of their 
interest of scandal; and surely they give a 
misleading impression of French life and 
character. The third play in the volume, 
" They," is a clever and cynical one-act farce, 
in which a bridegroom and a bride, meeting 
by chance for the first time in a hotel, decide 
to leave their newly married spouses and 



elope. This trifle is written with much gaiety 
and spirit. 

At once more serious and more humorous 
are the three one-act pieces in Mrs. Havelock 
Ellis's " Love in Danger." The scenes are all 
laid in the kitchens of Cornish cottages, and 
the dialogue has a strong and delightful flavor 
of the soil. As the title of the volume sug- 
gests, each of the plays deals with a crisis in 
married love. In " The Subjection of Kezia," 
Joe Pengilly, rather stupid, much in love, and 
married two years, is perplexed and worried 
by the " teasiness " and crossness of his wife. 
He confides in his older friend, Matthew 
Trevaskis, a travelled philosopher who has 
had domestic troubles of his own. Matthew 
confidently diagnoses the case, and prescribes 
the cane as a remedy; with much difficulty 
he induces the reluctant Joe to go with him 
and purchase the hateful implement. The 
solution, unexpected by all three, is thor- 
oughly satisfactory. In "The Pixy" the 
endangered love is that of a husband for his 
dead wife. The situation is an uncommon 
one, and is not made entirely clear ; the piece 
succeeds as a study in character, but not as 
a play. In "Mothers" the threatened ruin 
of a family is averted by the triumph of the 
maternal instinct over the sexual, not in the 
wife, but in her rival. Mrs. Ellis's characters 
are always firmly and delicately drawn, and 
her situations are presented sympathetically 
and with the restraint that gives added force. 
The first and third plays should act well. 

Love is in danger in Mr. Zangwill's " Plas- 
ter Saints" also; but the main issue is of a 
different sort. The Reverend Dr. Rodney 
Vaughn is a leading light in one of the dis- 
senting churches. He is a robust, powerful, 
and thoroughly human minister, and exercises 
great influence throughout his neighborhood. 
His wife, a saintly Puritan, discovers and 
forces him to admit that a year or so pre- 
viously he has had a love affair with his secre- 
tary and is the father of her child. Mrs. 
Vaughn tries to force him to public confes- 
sion, and threatens to divorce him so that he 
may marry the girl. He defends his course 
of deception on grounds of the harm his expo- 
sure would do to the church and to individu- 
als, and of the uselessness of destroying his 
future influence. It is through his sin, he 
declares, that he has become able really to 
help sinners. The problem thus presented is 
the theme of the play. Vaughn comes' over to 
his wife's position, let the plaster saint be 
smashed, and the real man step forth to do 
what work he, can in the world. But when it 
appears that his public confession would ruin 
her daughter's prospects, Mrs. Vaughn too

reverses her attitude; and the play ends 
rather weakly with a quasi-vindication of 
Vaughn's original course. No real solution 
of the problem is presented; but both sides 
of the case are vigorously argued, with some 
wit and much rhetoric. Why Mr. Zangwill 
should choose to call the piece in his sub-title 
" a high comedy in three movements " is a 
double mystery. The authors of our genuine 
" high comedy," we may be pretty sure, would 
have shunned the term like poison if it had 
been invented in their days. "Plaster Saints," 
in point of fact, is primarily not comedy, but 
melodrama. And why on earth should any 
dramatist think proper to call his acts 
" movements " 1 

"Plaster Saints" is the work of a clever 
man of talent; Mr. Galsworthy's "A Bit o' 
Love " bears the mark of genius. Its charac- 
ters are never, like Mr. Zangwill's, " stagey " 
or rhetorical ; they are absolutely unconscious 
of an audience, and real. Mr. Galsworthy is 
not here dealing with a sociological problem, 
as he does in some of his earlier plays. The 
wrong-headed criticism which must find a 
thesis in every serious play can doubtless dis- 
cover one here, but the interest does not lie 
in any thesis ; it lies in the vivid and charm- 
ing characterization, and in the development 
of the central character through the action. 
For background there is a village in the "West 
of England, and a group of worthies whose 
talk is comparable in raciness and humor 
with that of Hardy's rustics. Michael Strang- 
way, the curate, is a very human saint with 
the passionate heart of a poet or musician. 
His wife, with whom he is hopelessly in love, 
has deserted him for a former lover. She 
comes back to entreat him not to divorce her, 
since divorce proceedings would ruin her 
lover. Rather than be the cause of this, she 
will even return to the husband for whom she 
has never cared. After a cruel struggle with 
himself, Michael consents to let her go. The 
interview is overheard by one of his parish- 
ioners, and the news, spreading rapidly, brings 
upon the curate the contempt of the neighbor- 
hood. He is hissed as he comes out of the 
church. Even the rector's wife an admira- 
bly drawn character, by the way, urges 
upon him the duty of divorce. " This great 
church of ours," she tells him, "is based on 
the rightful condemnation of wrong-doing. 
There are times when forgiveness is a sin." 
Strangway will not yield; but his desolation 
brings him to the verge of suicide. The ap- 
pearance of a child whom he frightens and 
then comforts, and of a farmer .who is pluck- 
ily struggling with a great grief, restore him 
to his real self. Mr. Galsworthy's insight 



appears in nothing more strikingly than in 
this fine and strong conclusion. A lesser play- 
wright would not have resisted the tempta- 
tion of the obviously effective tragic end. The 
workmanship of the play, indeed, is every- 
where fine and strong; from the literary as 
well as from the dramatic point of view, it is 
a continuous delight. 

An equally finished bit of work, which must 
be considered by itself, is Anatole France's 
charming mediaeval farce, " The Man Who 
Married a Dumb Wife." This has been well 
translated by Professor Curtis Hidden Page, 
who supplies also an interesting Introduction. 
The play is based on a story told by Rabelais, 
of a man who, sad because his wife is dumb, 
becomes sadder when her speech is restored 
by a famous surgeon, and who finds relief 
only in an operation which makes him stone 
deaf. M. France has adhered closely to this 
simple outline; but his play is a marvel of 
literary dexterity. Without any affectation 
of archaism, he has, as Professor Page re- 
marks, somehow infused the little farce with 
the very spirit of the old comedy, its lively 
action, its broad and simple humor. The thing 
is a trifle, a mere recreation for M. France, 
but it is executed with the cunning hand of 
the master. Our own writers lack this fine 
historical sense ; not one of them could so per- 
fectly assume the tone and manner of that 
earlier time. HOMER E. WOODBRIDGE. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

With the exception of two or three "sports," 
Mr. Harold Bindloss has written upwards of 
a score of novels having substantially the 
same thematic material, and it is surprising 
to note how successfully he contrives to in- 
vest this material with fresh interest upon 
each new venture. The scene is always West- 
ern Canada; the hero is always a man of 
simple integrity and self-reliant character; 
the heroine is always something of a patri- 
cian, slow to reach an appreciation of the 
hero's genuine human worth. Inimical social 
influences alw r ays work to delay the romantic 
consummation; there is always a villain or 
two occupied in thwarting the hero's activi- 
ties; and there is always a fierce battle with 
nature, in which the fury of the elements is 
met and overcome by sheer pluck and dogged 
perseverance. This is the story of " Harding

of Allenwood," as it is of most of its prede- 
cessors. We note that Mr. Bindloss's heroes 
are more convincing than his heroines. The 
charms of the latter are made known to us 
inferentially rather than by clear portraiture. 
The author is singularly chary in the matter 
of their personal description, and gives us no 
more than hints on the physical side. His 
heroes are much better done, and all in all 
he is a man's writer rather than a caterer to 
the tastes of his feminine readers. But in his 
plodding prosaic way he does it all remarka- 
bly well, and it is a marvel that he can thus 
continue doing the same thing over and over 
again without making the monotony of the 
proceeding too w r earisome. One thing we 
know for certain that whatever the tragic 
complications of the romance, the difficulties 
will all be cleared away, and the ending made 
happy. 

" The Landloper," Mr. Holman Day's new 
novel, hardly justifies its sub-title, "A Ro- 
mance of the Woods." It is true that it opens 
in the woods, with its vagabond hero on the 
tramp. But it soon takes us to the city, and 
keeps us there. Walker Farr (which is not 
his real name) has taken to the road as a 
fugitive from the law, owing to a situation 
created by his quixotic self-sacrifice to save 
his father's reputation. He has also sought 
to divest himself of human sympathies that 
he may escape active participation in the 
affairs of men. But the social claim proves 
too strong for him when he comes face to face 
with the conditions created by the unholy 
alliance of business and politics in the New 
England State which is the scene of his ad- 
ventures. An unscrupulous syndicate has 
got control of the municipal water-supply 
systems of the Commonwealth, and is sup- 
plying typhoid-infected drinking water to its 
customers. Farr feels constrained to make 
himself " an enemy of the people " by an 
attack upon this criminal conspiracy, and 
sets himself to work with such effect that he 
destroys the power of the syndicate, and 
causes the election of a new governor hon- 
est and courageous enough to overthrow the 
whole corrupt system. Along with this civic 
crusade goes Farr's own personal romance, in 
which the villain is duly thwarted, and the 
girl securely won. Farr makes a very en- 
gaging hero for this complication of senti- 
ment and pathos and political intrigue, and 
his procedure has a quality of originality 
which does credit to the author's invention, 
and does not permit the reader's interest to 
lapse for a moment. 

From the imagined memoirs of one Lord 
Henry Goade, in eighteen manuscript folio 



volumes, Mr. Rafael Sabatini has pretended 
to gather the material for a romance entitled 
"The Sea-Hawk." Without the aid of this 
ponderous autobiography, he tells us, "it 
were impossible to reconstruct the life of that 
Cornish gentleman who became a renegade 
and a Barbary Corsair and might have be- 
come Basha of Algiers but for certain mat- 
ters which are to be set forth." Adopting 
the fiction, then, w y e express our heartfelt 
gratitude to the mythical Sir Henry for pre- 
serving his record of the deeds of Sir Oliver 
Tressilian, the mighty-thewed and fiery- 
tempered hero of this stirring tale of the 
spacious times of Queen Bess. It is one of the 
most exciting yarns of its good old-fashioned 
sort that we have encountered for many years. 
Sir Oliver became a corsair because the 
treachery of his half-brother caused him to be 
trepanned and sold into slavery, and because 
the fair Rosamund believed him to have been 
the murderer of her own brother. When the 
whirligig of time eventually brought into his 
power both the treacherous half-brother and 
the faithless maiden, he was enabled to have 
his revenge upon the one, and so to enlighten 
the other as to regain her love. How he res- 
cued her from Moorish captivity, and how he 
cleared his own name in the eyes of the 
English judges who would have hanged him 
incontinently, is recounted for us in a thrill- 
ing tale which rises steadily to a dramatic 
climax, and comes out in a way to satisfy all 
our romantic instincts. Mr. Sabatini is a 
wonder-worker in the narrative of adventure, 
and we are especially grateful to him for 
sparing us the fustian of the artificial ar- 
chaism in language with which practitioners 
in this kind are wont to clothe the products 
of their invention.

Peaceful There is an old saying that 

musings in before forty we seek pleasure, 
after forty we shun pain. Some 
such truth as that, if it be a truth, may help 
to explain why Mr. Arthur Christopher Ben- 
son, in the maturity of his somewhat more 
than forty years, is inclined to look upon 
human life and all human activity as par- 
taking of the nature of an avoidance of ill. 
This, at any rate, is the view illustrated and 
defended in the opening paper of "Escape, 
and Other Essays" (Century Co.), a collec- 
tion of meditative disquisitions refreshingly 
remote from the theme now occupying the 
minds of so many writers and of the great

majority of readers. It is a remoteness for 
which the author feels constrained to offer an 
apology, or a justification. "Is it right, is it 
decent," he asks, " to unfold an old picture of 
peace before the eyes of those who have had 
to look into chaos and destruction ? " and he 
answers : " Yes, I believe that it is right and 
wholesome to do this, because the most treach- 
erous and cowardly thing we can do is to dis- 
believe in life. Those old dreams and visions 
were true enough, and they will be true 
again. They represent the real life to which 
we must try to return." Therefore he directs 
his thoughts and ours to such perennial 
themes of interest as literature and life, sun- 
set, charm, dreams, schooldays, authorship, 
"Walt Whitman, villages, and some of the 
deeper mysteries of our existence. Much of 
the writer's intimate personal history creeps, 
here and there, into his pages. In his chap- 
ter on authorship it is curious to note his 
confession that without the prospect of pub- 
lication he could hardly retain his interest in 
writing. This contrasts with a much earlier 
assertion, in one of his first books, that the 
mere act of literary composition was enough 
in itself to keep his pen going. Art for its 
own sake then seemed to suffice him. He does 
not note this significant change of tone. We 
acquire a sadder wisdom with the passing 
years. In discussing dreams Mr. Benson de- 
clares his belief that his own dreams, contrary 
to the usual rule, occur in the midst of pro- 
found sleep, not on its either edge; for, says 
he, "I have occasionally been awakened sud- 
denly by some loud sound, and on these occa- 
sions I have come out of dreams of an inten- 
sity and vividness that I have never known 
equaled." But, obviously, that proves noth- 
ing; or it may argue the very contrary of 
the author's contention. The book is a worthy 
addition to a notable series. 



A mine of 

entomological 

wonder-lore. 



The insect world remains a terra 
incognita to most people because 
of the small size of the individ- 
uals which compose its myriad hordes. The 
microscope makes possible, on the one hand, 
the minute examination of these diminutive 
hosts; and microphotography, on the other 
1 hand, has made such progress in recent years, 
due largely to applications of the electrio 
light, that permanent photographs of the 
scales of a butterfly's wing revealing the 
minutest detail of form and ornament can be 
made with great success. The unobserved 
and hidden beauties of^the insect world which 
have hitherto been reserved for the profes- 
sional entomologist or amateur microscopist 
have thus become available for publication 



without the great expense entailed by expert 
technical drawings and lithographic reproduc- 
tion. The explorations of tropical lands since 
the days of Bates and Wallace have accumu- 
lated great stores of unique and interesting in- 
formation about beautiful and curious insects 
largely unutilized since the compilations of 
Figuier and J. G. Wood. Mr. Edward Step, 
in his "Marvels of Insect Life" (McBride, 
Nast & Co.), has availed himself of a re- 
markably large mass of fresh and out-of-the- 
way material in this field, and has portrayed 
it with the aid of camera and microscope, 
and also with the frequent help, especially in 
his full-page plates, of the constructive artist, 
who usually adds a few unnatural touches to 
intensify the entomological drama. We can 
hardly agree with Mr. Raymond Ditmar's 
statement in his preface that Fabre is here 
"brought up to date." The great French 
popularizer of insect lore captivates his reader 
by the logical sequence as well as the dramatic 
interest of his story; while there is about as 
much sequence in Mr. Step's treatise as there 
is in a vaudeville programme. The author has 
studiously eliminated in his treatment all 
semblance of logical continuity of subjects or 
recognition of relationships of his material, 
with the false idea that chaos is simplicity. 
His sub-title, "An Account of Structure and 
Habit," is for this reason rather misleading. 
Fortunately, his index makes it possible for 
an inquiring reader to ascertain what the book 
really contains. Mr. Step uncritically calls 
the black gnat the " pellagra fly," apparently 
unaware that Sambon's theory of the relation 
of this insect to that dread disease has been 
discredited. The illustrations are very abun- 
dant, there being one or more on each page; 
and many, the microphotographs especially, 
are fairly well executed. The technique of 
illumination has not been well achieved in 
some of the photographs under low magnifica- 
tions. The text is clearly written, and the 
book is a mine of interesting but somewhat 
disjointed entomological lore.

Mr. Markino, and thus unites the grace and 
idealism and ingenuousness of the reminiscent 
poet with the delicacy and dreamy beauty of 
this eminent artist's brush. Both poet and 
painter are too favorably known to need a 
reviewer's commendatory word. San Fran- 
cisco in its radiance and gaiety, Joaquin 
Miller on his " Heights," Chicago in its smoke 
and busy turmoil, London with its fog and 
beautiful women, and Japan after eleven 
years of absence these are the writer's main 
themes, treated with much of the same boyish 
frankness and pleasing intermixture of native 
idioms that made Mr. Markino's story of his 
similar wanderings so oddly engaging. The 
piquancy of these pages from the life of a 
Japanese poet-traveller finds no small part of 
its explanation in the author's epigrammatic 
statement that " the Japanese mind, like any 
other Japanese thing, only works upside down 
to that of Englishmen." Admirable is his 
enthusiasm for the Poet of the Sierras, next 
door to whom on the mountain-side he made 
his home in reverent discipleship for four 
happy though impecunious years. In fact, all 
that is poetic in suggestion stirs Mr. Noguchi 
and gives eloquence to his pen, whereas the 
prosaic materialism of the Chicago viewed by 
him in a brief visit elicits expressions of not 
unnatural loathing. " I think the god of the 
Chicagoans is a devil," he frankly declares. 
Like his friend and compatriot already named, 
he attains some of his highest flights in praise 
of occidental female beauty. Throughout his 
narrative he shows himself fair-minded, as 
scrupulous to censure Japanese defects as to 
praise foreign excellences. It is a book of no 
narrow outlook, and it is entertainingly writ- 
ten. Interspersed bits of the writer's verse go 
well with his not unpoetic prose. 



Germany's 

economic 



In hls ^ ks On " The Theory of 

the Leisure Class " and " The 
Instinct of Workmanship," pub- 
lished in recent years, Mr. Thorstein Yeblen 
offered an acute and illuminating analysis of 
certain highly important modern sociological 
and economic conditions throughout the world 
at large. In his latest book, " Imperial Ger- 
many and the Industrial Revolution" (Mac- 
millan), he has achieved equal success in the 
interpretation of the economic development 
of a single country. This volume, it should be 
observed, was written more than a year ago. 
Its publication was delayed by the war, but 
it is in no sense a " war book." Furthermore, 
it has not been Mr. Veblen's purpose in the 
volume to write an economic history of Ger- 
many; that has been done by various other 
scholars. The object has been to establish a 



comparison and correlation between the eco- 
nomic phenomena of Germany and of the 
English-speaking peoples, " considered as two 
distinct and somewhat divergent lines of cul- 
tural development in modern times." The 
ground upon which the inquiry runs is chiefly 
the "industrial circumstances that have 
shaped the outcome in either case." And the 
intention has been to account for Germany's 
industrial advance and high efficiency by 
natural causes, " without drawing on the logic 
of manifest destiny, Providential nepotism, 
national genius, and the like." The author 
begins his inquiry in the stone age of the 
Baltic peoples. But he adds little to the value 
of his work by so doing, except in so far as he 
is enabled to impress the facts of the hybrid 
character of the German people and the lack 
of essential difference in race between the 
Germans, English, Dutch, and the Slavs of 
Great Russia. His appraisal of the physical 
resources and adaptiveness of the German 
lands is valuable. It is, however, the economic 
development which has taken place under the 
regulating hand of the Hohenzollern dynasty, 
and especially since the second quarter of the 
nineteenth century, that, deservedly, absorbs 
the author's attention chiefly. It is demon- 
strated that Germany did not develop the 
technical arts as a native growth, but bor- 
rowed them, largely from England, and that 
she thereby escaped many of the unfortunate 
conditions which in the latter country at- 
tended the earlier stages of the Industrial 
Revolution. Her people, too, did not develop 
that individual initiative and habit of self- 
help which in England promoted the growth 
of political democracy and the decline of 
"authority," a fact of the greatest impor- 
tance because it meant that there were pre- 
served those earlier habits of mind which were 
suited to the maintenance of centralized, coer- 
cive, irresponsible, dynastic control. The eco- 
nomic policy of the Imperial State since 1871 
is described fully and cleverly. That, in de- 
fault of the close and continuous regulation 
which the State has imposed, the course of 
German industry and trade would have been 
as different from the historical one as Mr. 
Veblen imagines, the reader may not agree. 
But the fact of regulation remains, and the 
inner character and significance of it has 
never been described more effectively than in 
the present volume. In a pregnant v chapter 
entitled " The Net Gain " the author makes 
an interesting appraisal of German "Kultur." 
The conclusion at which he arrives is that the 
principal characteristic of this culture is its 
retarded adherence to certain mediaeval or 
sub-mediaeval habits of thought, the equiva-

lents of which belong farther back than the 
historic present in the experience of other 
western peoples, notably the English and 
French. The cultural scheme, in short, is out 
of date, and out of touch with itself in that it 
is in part archaic and in part quite new. On 
this account the main body of it cannot be 
transfused abroad; indeed, it cannot per- 
manently be held fast in statu quo within the 
confines of the Fatherland. 



Recent P ro res* The N ' W ' Harris lectures for 

in the study 1914 at Northwestern Univer- 
sity were delivered by Dr. Ed- 
win Grant Conklin, professor of biology in 
Princeton University, and dealt with the gen- 
eral topic of human heredity. They are now 
published under the title, " Heredity and 
Environment in the Development of Men " 
(Princeton University Press). Though many 
books have been issued in this field in the past 
five years, none has attained so successfully 
the vitally important features of simplicity, 
clarity, and progressive development of the 
subject, and a sympathetic correlation of the 
teachings of biology with ideals of human 
freedom and with the basis of personal and 
social ethics. The lectures were prepared for 
a general audience, and the subject has been 
made both plain and interesting without sacri- 
fice of scientific soundness or logical complete- 
ness. The subject is consistently developed to 
its final applications to human problems of 
gravest import. The book deals with the de- 
velopment of the animal body from the germ 
cells to the functioning body, and of the mind 
from the lowest tropisms to will and con- 
sciousness. It discusses the germ cells and 
the mechanism of heredity and of develop- 
ment, the significance of the individual, the 
laws of inheritance, especially of human traits, 
the influence of environment and of func- 
tional activity upon development and evolu- 
tion. The control of human evolution by the 
application of our growing knowledge of hu- 
man strength and weakness and its behavior in 
inheritance is sanely discussed, with a frank 
and forceful statement of the possibilities and 
limitations of eugenic measures. Most sug- 
gestive and stimulating is the lucid discus- 
sion of genetics and ethics, determinism and 
responsibility, and the relations between the 
individual and the race. Simple diagrams 
elucidate the objective phases of the subject, 
and there are an adequate glossary, a bibliog- 
raphy, and an index. The book is an authori- 
tative, scholarly, complete, and very up-to-date 
presentation of current biological fact and 
conclusions, applied with breadth of view to 
the fundamental problems of human life. 



The arduous 
life of a 
reformer. 



Descended from the Shaws of 
Rothiemurchus on her father's 
side, and inheriting, apparently, 
many of the qualities of her maternal grand- 
mother, also a Scotch woman and a person of 
dauntless courage and of ideas in advance of 
her time, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw has but 
obeyed the promptings of her nature in de- 
voting her life to the service of one worthy 
cause after another, until now she is classed 
by general consent with such noted reform- 
ers of her own sex as Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. 
Livermore, Mrs. Stanton, and Miss Willard. 
A vivid and stirring account of her reform 
labors, and of her earlier life before the pas- 
sion for reform had seized her, comes from 
her own pen in " The Story of a Pioneer " 
(Harper), wherein her English birth and in- 
fant memories, her nearly fatal voyage to this 
country in 1851, the well-nigh incredible 
hardships endured by her family on the 
Michigan frontier, and all the obstacles she 
herself had to surmount in attaining her 
present position, are set forth with the magic 
touch found only in a true narration of things 
well worth narrating. Let a single passage 
from the Michigan epoch indicate the char- 
acter of the long struggle that furnishes the 
substance of the book. "During our first 
winter we lived largely on corn-meal, making 
a little journey of twenty miles to buy it; 
but even at that we were better off than our 
neighbors, for I remember one family in our 
region who for an entire winter lived solely 
on coarse-grained yellow turnips, gratefully 
changing their diet to leeks when these came 
in the spring." Dr. Shaw's public life is so 
well known that it need not be outlined here ; 
her earlier experiences in the forbidding 
enterprise of educating herself for that life 
in the face of family opposition and an utter 
lack of material resources are less familiar, 
and will be read with keen interest. School- 
teaching, the ministry, medical study and 
some occasional practice, and various reforms 
have successively or all together engaged her 
attention and her energies. In her character 
of President of the National American 
Woman Suffrage Association she has the 
following to say on a subject of some present 
importance : " There has never been any 
sympathy among American suffragists for 
the militant suffrage movement in England, 
and personally I am wholly opposed to it. 
I do not believe in war in any form; and if 
violence on the part of men is undesirable in 
achieving their ends, it is much more so on 
the part of women ; for women never appear 
to less advantage than in physical combats 
with men." Of interest is her assertion that

"Mr. Emerson, at first opposed to woman 
suffrage, became a convert to it during the 
last years of his life a fact his son and 
daughter omit to mention in his biography." 
The book's numerous illustrations have an 
attractive quality comparable with that of 
the reading matter. 



A Scandinavian Tt was exceptionally appropriate 
historical that the American-Scandinavian 

Foundation should include in 
its interesting series of " Scandinavian Clas- 
sics" a translation of that powerfully vivid 
dramatization of the career of one of Swe- 
den's great historical characters, Strind- 
berg's "Master Olof." The hero of this 
drama was the Luther of his people, the relig- 
ious innovator who overturned the rule of 
Rome in the realm and reign of Gustavus 
Vasa, and who was himself destroyed by his 
sometime protector, the King, when he be- 
came involved with a group of Anabaptists 
holding social democracy as a prominent arti- 
cle of their creed. In Strindberg's presenta- 
tion of his hero, Olof becomes the prototype 
of all idealistic reformers, uncompromising at 
moments as Ibsen's Brand, but more living 
than he because more subtly studied in his 
moods of weakness as well as in his exalta- 
tions of strength. He was, the poet admits, a 
kind of shadow of his own rebellious self at 
twenty-three, " ambitious and weak-willed ; 
unscrupulous when something was at stake, 
and yielding at other times; possessed of 
great self-confidence, mixed with a deep mel- 
ancholy; balanced and irrational; hard and 
gentle." The pessimism that colors most of 
Strindberg's later work is here already 
strongly marked, but it is a pessimism by no 
means entire, since it is rooted in a thor- 
oughly scientific and impersonal idealism. 
There is no end to the struggle for human 
progress, Olof's creator makes him say, 
although in the fight individuals who for- 
ward the victory must seem to fail and per- 
ish before they have done more than hold up 
the torch an instant to light their stumbling 
fellows on the way. 



Bodies politic 
and their 
government. 



A book reminiscent of Sir John 
Seeley's " Introduction to Polit- 
ical Science," but with vastly 
more of fact and less of philosophy, is Mr. 
B. S. Hammond's "Bodies Politic and Their 
Governments" (Putnam), which supple- 
ments an earlier volume on the outlines of 
comparative politics. The note struck is 
classification: the classification of communi- 
ties or welded groups of communities as dif- 
ferentiated from states, the author contending 



that the State is a legal and almost abstract 
conception, while the body politic whether 
we conceive of it as all the living members of 
a German tribe, or all the living inhabitants 
of the British Empire lends itself to con- 
crete presentation in its capacity for acting 
as if it were a single person. Having chosen 
this basis, the writer cannot deal directly 
with the evolution of forms of government, 
but gives a succession of historical and politi- 
cal sketches of the various nations at different 
periods. The necessary result is a sacrifice of 
smoothness of progression for vividness. His 
classification includes tribes, simple communi- 
ties, simple urban bodies politic ("city 
states"), composite urban bodies politic, uni- 
tary nations, and heterogeneous empires, and 
is conveniently set forth in diagram at the 
close of his discussion of each epoch of his- 
tory. The historical sketches are accurate, 
and founded largely on original sources ; but 
much detail could have been omitted without 
damaging the pictures of the structure of the 
bodies politic. The author's analyses of gov- 
ernments will not always pass without ques- 
tion, and there are especially to be noted some 
rather fantastic parallels, as in the compari- 
son of Tammany to the Parte Guelf a of Flor- 
ence. But this was inevitable in a field where 
speculation had to seek general analogies, and 
simply demonstrates what Mr. Hammond 
would certainly admit that the laws of 
political phenomena are not sufficiently well 
established to serve as the basis for a genu- 
inely scientific classification of bodies politic. 
The work shows vigorous original thought, 
and is a useful coup d'oeil of the field of 
government. 



A scientist in 
British East 
Africa. 



With the best of good-will, we 
can see little of importance in 
Dr. Felix Oswald's "Alone in 
the Sleeping-Sickness Country" (Button). 
It is the narrative of a trip into British East 
Africa for the purpose of collecting fossil 
bones from Miocene deposits near Karungu, 
on the east side of Lake Victoria Nyanza. 
The collector was but two months in his field. 
The results of his expedition may have had 
importance for palaeontology, but are pre- 
sented elsewhere. While he was industrious 
and devoted to his task, there was nothing of 
adventure or of special interest in his expe- 
rience. He came into contact with two tribes 
of natives the Kavirondo, of whom * he saw 
considerable; and the Kisii, of whom he saw 
little. He gives scant information regarding 
them, and some of what he gives is of doubt- 
ful quality. From the title of his book, we 
might expect him to present some information 



334 



THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 14 



about sleeping-sickness; but we have merely 
incidental references to the subject. There is 
some geological matter in the book, but even 
this is uninteresting and scrappy. In other 
words, the book is a mere narrative, and as 
narrative it lacks the elements desirable in- 
cident, adventure, novelty. There are some 
good illustrations, chiefly of landscape and 
physical features, and an apparently good 
map. 

BRIEFER MENTION. 

A recent addition to the " Home University 
Library" (Holt) is "The Negro" by Dr. W. E. 
B. Du Bois. The greater part of the volume is 
devoted to the history and culture of the negro in 
Africa; the final chapters deal with the negro in 
America and the problems of the negro. As con- 
trasted with Mr. Booker T. Washington, Dr. Du 
Bois demands a radical programme ; but his learn- 
ing, his scrutiny of the past, the present, and the 
future from the colored man's standpoint, and his 
exposure of the exploitation of negroes by the 
white races throughout the world in our day, make 
the volume informing and timely. 

Mr. John Cotton Dana's " Modern American 
Library Economy as Illustrated by the Newark, 
N. J., Free Public Library " has advanced to Part 
XVII. of Vol. II., which treats of " Maps, Atlases 
and Geographical Publications," and is a " revi- 
sion and enlargement of the second part of the 
Business Branch pamphlet published in 1910." 
Miss Sarah B. Ball, who has charge of the Busi- 
ness Branch, is the compiler. Directions are 
given for the care of the class of material indi- 
cated in the title, and lists of the more important 
maps and atlases suitable for library use are 
added. Drawings and facsimiles help to make the 
whole subject plain to the reader. No other 
treatise, so far as we know, handles -the matter so 
fully and with such care and expert knowledge. 

Mr. Porter E. Sargent has projected a new 
series of handbooks relating to education and 
travel, to be known as the " Sargent Handbook 
Series," for which he is responsible both as editor 
and publisher. The first volume, "A Handbook of 
the Best Private Schools of the United States and 
Canada," has been prepared chiefly for the 
guidance of the parent who wishes a discrimi- 
nating manual on the best schools of the country, 
the principle of selection being merit alone. There 
are chapters giving a general survey of the private 
school situation; while histories and criticisms of 
the schools are included. In the Introduction to 
the volume the editor tells how the work of com- 
pilation suffered, while in progress, due to delays 
and the reluctance of principals to give the infor- 
mation required, and he promises improvements 
in the next annual issue, which will appear in the 
spring. So practicable and serviceable is this 
initial venture that it is probable no one will feel 
the dissatisfaction in question so keenly as does 
the editor himself. 



NOTES. 



" The Elements of Style," an introduction to 
literary criticism, by Mr. David W. Rannie, is 
announced for autumn publication. 

The second volume of the collected works of 
Martin Luther is announced for immediate publi- 
cation by Messrs. A. J. Holman Co. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett's long-awaited completion 
of the " Clayhanger " trilogy will be published by 
the Doran Co. on November 6. " These Twain " is 
its title. ' 

" The Porcupine," a three-act drama of domes- 
tic entanglement, by Mr. Edwin Arlington Rob- 
inson, is announced for immediate issue by the 
Macmillan Co. 

Mr. Frederic L. Huidekoper has prepared an 
extended work on " The Military Unpreparedness 
of the United States," which the Macmillan Co. 
will soon publish. 

The fifth volume in Constance Garnett's new 
series of translations from Dostoievsky's works 
will bear the title " The Insulted and Injured." 
Messrs. Macmillan announce the book for early 
publication. 

Mr. Arthur Rackham's gift-book this year will 
be an edition of Dickens's " Christmas Carol," uni- 
form with the same artist's "^Esop's Fables." 
There will be a large paper edition limited to five 
hundred copies. 

In Mr. Compton Mackenzie's forthcoming novel, 
" Guy and Pauline," we shall have a glimpse of 
Michael Fane, the character whose boyhood and 
youth we followed in " Youth's Encounter " and 
" Sinister Street." 

"The Origin of the War," by Karl Fedem, 
written from the German point of view, and 
" Warlike England as Seen by Herself," by Ferdi- 
nand Tonnies, will be published this month by the 
G. W. Dillingham Co. 

" The Lusitania's Last Voyage," by Mr. Charles 
E. Lauriat, Jr., describing from the vantage-point 
of an eye-witness one of the most dramatic epi- 
sodes of the present war, will soon be published by 
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. 

Two volumes of serious interest to be published 
shortly by Messrs. Harper are Mr. John Barrett's 
"Pan- America and Pan- Americanism," and "Prin- 
ciples of Labor Legislation " by Dr. John R. Com- 
mons and Mr. John B. Andrews. 

With the news of the death of Henri Gaudier- 
Brzeska in the French trenches comes the 
announcement of a book on this famous Franco- 
Polish sculptor by Mr. Ezra Pound, to be pub- 
lished by the John Lane Co. early next year. 

Almost immediately Messrs. Putnam will pub- 
lish a volume entitled " Belgium, Neutral and 
Loyal: The War of 1914," by Emile Waxweiler, 
Director of the Solway Institute of Sociology at 
Brussels, Member of the Academie Royale of 
Belgium. 

" Modern Austria and Her Racial Problems," by 
Virginio Gayda, to be published at once by Messrs.

Dodd, Mead & Co., is a study of Austria just 
before the war, its main theme being the struggle 
between the feudal aristocracy and the popular 
movements. 

" Methods and Aims in the Study of Litera- 
ture," by Professor Lane Cooper of Cornell Uni- 
versity, will be issued before the end of the month 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co. It forms a companion 
volume to the author's earlier book, "Aristotle on 
the Art of Poetry." 

Mr. Frederick Palmer, the accredited corre- 
spondent of the American Press at the British 
Headquarters in France, who recently published 
an account of his visit to the Grand Fleet at sea, 
has a volume in the press entitled " Personal 
Phases of the War." 

Mrs. Edith Wharton is soon to publish through 
Messrs. Scribner a book dealing with her expe- 
riences and impressions of France in the war, 
including her own visits to different parts of the 
French battle line. Some of the chapters have 
already appeared in " Scribner's Magazine." 

A book from the trenches entitled " The Red 
Horizon," by Mr. Patrick Macgill, author of 
" Children of the Dead End," is nearly ready for 
publication. Having related in " The Amateur 
Army " his experiences as a soldier in the making, 
Mr. Macgill now describes some of his impressions 
at the front. 

One of the most interesting books of the season 
will doubtless be Mr. William Dean Howells's 
autobiographical volume, " Years of My Youth," 
which tells the story of his childhood and early 
manhood up to the time of his welcome into the 
circle of " The Atlantic Magazine " and his going 
abroad as United States Consul. Messrs. Harper 
plan to publish the volume this month. 

Mr. Walter Lippman, author of " Drift and 
Mastery" and "A Prelude to Politics," has ar- 
ranged with Messrs. Holt for the publication of 
his next book, " The Stakes of Diplomacy." The 
volume attempts to picture the conditions under 
which diplomacy is carried on, the central prob- 
lem with which it deals, and the general policy 
which a firm and peaceful organization of the 
world requires. 

Under the title, " The Nearing Case," Dr. Light- 
ner Witmer, head of the Department of Psy- 
chology of the University of Pennsylvania, has 
prepared a complete statement of the events that 
led up to Doctor Nearing's dismissal and the facts 
in all their ramifications. The book will be pub- 
lished at once by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. It contains 
practically the indictment, the evidence, the argu- 
ments, and many interesting documents relating to 
the case. 

The new life of Wordsworth by Professor G. 
McLean Harper, of Princeton University, which 
will be ready next month, deals with aspects of 
the poet's life little touched upon by his biog- 
raphers, especially in regard to his earlier years. 
Much unprinted material was placed at the 
author's disposal for the purpose by Mr. Gordon 
Wordsworth, the poet's grandson, who also al- 
lowed him to examine the manuscripts of Dorothy 



Wordsworth's Journals. Some unpublished letters 
of Wordsworth, now in the British Museum and 
Dr. Williams's Library, are also included. 

Professor George Edward Woodberry has about 
completed his critical Introduction to the " Col- 
lected Poems of Rupert Brooke," and the publish- 
ers (John Lane Co.) expect to have the volume 
ready for publication late this month. In addition 
to Professor Woodberry's Introduction, the book 
will contain a biographical note by Miss Margaret 
Lavington, of England, which was prepared under 
the personal direction of Mr. Edward Marsh, 
Brooke's literary executor. 

Mr. George Haven Putnam's " Memories of a 
Publisher," to be issued immediately, will continue 
his reminiscences, the first volume of which, 
" Memories of My Youth," appeared last year. 
The new volume will also be a continuation of the 
history of the House of Putnam from the year 
1872, to which date the record was carried by the 
author in his memoir of his father and the founder 
of the firm, George Palmer Putnam. Many per- 
sonal recollections will be included of well-known 
authors on both sides of the Atlantic. Other 
chapters relate to Mr. Putnam's manifold activ- 
ities outside the book world. 

Especial interest attaches to the collection of 
" Letters of Washington Irving to Henry Bre- 
voort, 1807-1843," edited by Mr. George S. Hell- 
man, which Messrs. Putnam plan to issue at once 
in an edition limited to 255 copies, printed on 
Strathmore paper, and distinctively bound, num- 
bered, and signed. In the " Life of Irving," writ- 
ten by his nephew Pierre more than half a century 
ago, there were included various excerpts from 
the letters of Irving to Brevoort, but this series 
of about a hundred letters has, for the most 
part, remained unpublished. Letters printed very 
fragmentarily, and omitting personal names, are 
now given in their entirety; while the greater 
number of those now included were not drawn on 
by the previous editor. 

The second decennial prize of six thousand dol- 
lars, offered by the Trustees of Lake Forest Uni- 
versity under the terms of a bequest from the 
late William Bross, has been awarded to Rev. 
Thomas James Thorburn, of Hastings, England, 
for his book of Christian apologetics entitled 
" The Mythical Interpretation of the Gospels : 
Critical Studies in the Historic Narratives." 
Eight months were required for the judges to ex- 
amine the forty-nine manuscripts submitted, which 
represented authors scattered all the way from 
England through the United States to Japan and 
Australia. The first decennial Bross Prize was 
awarded ten years ago to the late Professor James 
Orr, D.D., of Glasgow, for his treatise on " The 
Problem of the Old Testament." This book has 
had a very wide circulation, and has been trans- 
lated into several foreign languages. The new 
Bross Prize book will be published as Volume VII. 
of " The Bross Library," and in accordance with 
the provisions of the deed of gift, complimentary 
copies will be sent to libraries throughout the 
United States and to certain libraries in foreign 
lands.

The original edition of this book was

This book brings Lincoln the man, not 
Lincoln the tradition, very near to us. It 
embodies the reminiscences of over five hun-

largely at first hand.

You, too, 
would write 
such a letter! 

SOMETIMES when you read let- 
ters like this from Col. Watterson 
and other noted men of affairs who 
have endorsed Sanatogen, you cannot 
help but wonder "Why did they 
write such letters?" 

And truly, it is remarkable for such 

men rarely endorse any article. And 

yet, even though YOU were one of 

the world's leaders, you, too, would 

write just such a letter! 

For imagine yourself in such a 
man's place at the height of your 
powers, but handicapped by stub- 
born ill - health that threatens 
your very career. 

And, then, suppose that you begin to 
take Sanatogen, and as it feeds and 
rebuilds the impoverished nervecells, 
you FEEL the old-time vitality re- 
turn, with a new vigor of mind and 
a new elasticity of body 

Wouldn'tyou be grateful ? And 
wouldn't you be willing, ay, 
even eager, to tell others the 
good that Sanatogen had done 
for you just as Col. Watterson 
and scores of other noted 
people have done ? 

Sanatogen is sold by good 
druggists everywhere in three 
sizes, from $1.00 up.

THE HAITIAN 
REVOLUTION 

By T. G. Steward 

Aside from its great historical value, the 
book reads like a romance. The terrific 
struggles of a handful of slaves are thrilling 
and inspiring. It gives a clear understand- 
ing of the negro race and the relations of 
France with the West Indies.

THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW 

From Lord Bryce : 



"The whole REVIEW is, so to speak, almost too good for a serial. There is matter 
in it for the making of books of permanent value. . . . What strikes me most in it 
all through is that it is fresh, not hackneyed or conventional, and that it is full of think- 
ing, written not because something has to be said, but because the writers have some- 
thing to say." 

From Professor A. S. Johnson, Cornell: 

"If anybody had told me, a year ago, that we should have, in this country, a 
magazine as good as this, I'd have spurned him as a false prophet. " 

From Professor William Lyon Phelps : 

"My wife and I are enjoying THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW immensely. I wish you 
would tell [the editor] how much we admire it; it is a proof that wit, originality, and charm 
may all be successfully employed on the side of the angels. " 

From Professor Paul Shorey : 

"I read with interest a larger proportion of THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW, I think, 
than of any other periodical. " 

The Nation : 

"Solid substance and brilliant execution. ... To such a quarterly The Nation 
extends the right hand of fellowship." 

American Review of Reviews: 

"An instant and deserved success. " 

London Times: 

"THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW, . . . is welcomed here. "

A Protest Against the New Tyranny 

WHICH IS NOT THE NEARLY OBSOLETE DESPOTISM OF 
ONE MAN OVER THE PEOPLE BUT THE NEWER DESPOTISM 

of Overzealous and Indiscriminate Popular Legislation 

OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN 

The dangers to America from this new tyranny have been ably pointed out in the August 
FORUM by Mr. Truxtun Beale, the eminent publicist and donor to education. In this con- 
tribution he shows how applicable to our present-day conditions are the remarkable essays by 
Herbert Spencer published in England fifty years ago under the title THE MAN vs. THE 
STATE. THE FORUM will republish eight of these essays serially, each chapter to be 
accompanied by expository articles on its present-day significance, these articles being specially 
written by the most eminent American authorities. Beginning in the September FORUM 
with Senator Root's article, the chapters with their expository contributors are as follows:

THE GREATEST AMERICAN POETRY SINCE WHITMAN'S.' 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS' remarkable book (Eighth Edition NOW Ready) 

SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY 



Mr. Masters' book is considered 
by many to be the most striking 
and important contribution to 
American letters in recent years: 

"An American 'Comedie Humaine' brings 
more characters into its pages than any 
American novel. . . . Takes its place among 
the masterpieces which are not of a time 
or a locality." Boston Transcript. 

"A work splendid in observation, mar- 
velous in the artistry of exclusion yet of 
democratic inclusiveness, piercingly analytic 
of character, of plastic fictility of handling, 
sympathetic underneath irony, humorous, 
pathetic, tragic, comic, particular yet uni- 
versal a Comedie Humaine a creation 
of a whole community of personalities. "- 
William Marion Reedy. 
"We find a strange impressiveness, akin to greatness in the 'Spoon River Anthology' 
of Edgar Lee Masters. ... It is a book which, whether one likes it or not, one must 
respect." The New Republic. 

"Mr. Masters speaks with a new and authentic voice. It is an illuminating piece of 
work, and an unforgettable one." Chicago Evening Post.

in his bones." New York Times. Cloth $1.25. Leather $1.50.

Wedded to him, not through union, 
But through separation.

THE PUGNACIOUS STYLE. 

It is the nature of man to love a good hater ; 
at any rate, a considerable part of mankind 
pays him the tribute of admiration for the 
vigor and constancy of his animosity. In like 
manner the reading world enjoys the aggres- 
sive energy and the keen stabs, or sledge- 
hammer blows, of him who writes with the 
intent of annihilating a foe or exploding a 
false doctrine; and this in spite of the fact 
that little of worth in the cause of truth and 
justice has ever been effected by passionate 
vehemence of style, no wrong-headed person 
has ever been bullied into reasonableness, and 
no enemy has ever been crushed by mere force 
of vituperation. As is illustrated every week 
and every day in the heated discussions that 
in these fevered times claim so much space in 
our newspapers and magazines, and even in 
our books, the controversialist falls easily into 
the error of hurting his cause by undue 
warmth of manner, and repels by intemper- 
ance of speech where he might win by modera- 
tion and restraint. If it be true, as experience 
inclines one to believe, that nobody was ever 
convinced by argument who was not already 
more than half persuaded, it is doubly true 
that no prejudiced person was ever induced by 
vituperation to renounce his prejudice and 
alter his opinions. 

Intellectual independence is dear to every 
one of us, and the faintest suspicion that an 
author is assailing that independence is enough 
to erect a barrier against the cogency of his 
reasoning. But if the controversialist can so 
state his case as to seem to leave his readers 
entire freedom of choice between acceptance 
and rejection of his views, he stands a good 
chance of making converts; and if, employing 
a somewhat subtler art, he can cause the reader 
to imagine himself a little more acute or a little 
more logical than the author, and can tickle 
him with the illusion of seeing important 
points that had escaped the other's duller per- 
ceptions (though it was just these points that 
the writer had adopted this artful means of 
making manifest), then the case is won, and 
the pleader is willing enough to renounce the 
glory of victory for its more substantial fruits.

THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 28 



But the partisan pamphleteer of these fiery 
times is prone to begin his polemic by antago- 
nizing the very persons he wishes to conciliate, 
and so his purpose is often defeated before he 
has fairly begun his argument. He commonly 
writes in a lively and spicy and highly read- 
able style, and is therefore followed with im- 
mense satisfaction by those who are already 
on his side, or who are not positively opposed 
to him. The pugnacious style in itself, such 
is erring human nature, appeals to most read- 
ers w r hen it does not chance to be directed too 
pointedly and personally against them; it 
keeps them awake, pleases them with a sense 
of taking part in laying low an army of stupid 
or malicious adversaries who needed only this 
unanswerable demonstration of the matter to 
induce them to confess the futility of further 
opposition; and it is delightful to serve the 
cause of truth and righteousness in this easy 
fashion, when all that is just and virtuous and 
noble is so manifestly on our side, and all that 
is false and wicked and perverse and abomin- 
able so evidently on the other. 

The immense vogue enjoyed by such con- 
tributions to so-called popular science as Pro- 
fessor Haeckel's widely-read solution of " The 
Riddle of the Universe" is no doubt largely 
due to the confidently aggressive air with 
which he exposes the folly of all those philoso- 
phers who pretend to see in the scheme of 
created things some element other than mat- 
ter and mechanism. How vastly superior one 
feels to Plato and Emerson and the whole tribe 
of mystics and dreamers when one has taken 
a hand with the Jena professor in their demoli- 
tion and has arrived at the point where one 
can say with this sturdy foe to every form of 
transcendental nonsense, " The supreme and 
all-pervading law of nature, the true and only 
cosmological law, is, in my opinion, the law of 
substance," and can regard with him the be- 
lief in the soul's immortality as the "highest 
point of superstition." But what if one hap- 
pens to be a Platonist and a dreamer to begin 
with? Will the controversial tone of "The 
Riddle of the Universe" work a change of 
heart and win a new convert to the Haeckelian 
doctrine ? Hardly. 

A long-recognized master of the pugna- 
ciously vituperative style, and one whom it is 
an unending delight to read, even though the 
reader be wise enough not to yield entire 
assent to what affords him this intellectual 
refreshment, is found in the author of that 



history of England which in the middle of the 
last century rivalled in popularity the novels 
of Dickens and Thackeray. It has been said 
of Macaulay's style that it is admirable for 
almost every purpose but telling the truth. 
Certainly it is an admirable style to adopt 
when one wishes not to spoil a good story in 
the telling. With what an array of rhetorical 
weapons Macaulay has assailed the luckless 
monarch who was the last of the Stuarts to sit 
on the throne of England, all the world knows. 
His merciless handling of that king's infamous 
tool, the bloodthirsty chief justice whose name 
has become synonymous with judicial severity, 
is almost as notorious. Jeffreys, as we are 
now warranted in believing, was not absolutely 
devoid of humanity, though a reading of 
Macaulay or of Campbell would incline a 
credulous person to regard him as a veritable 
monster of malice and cruelty. Mr. H. B. 
Irving, not many years ago, showed us the 
man as a human being. When Macaulay, 
trusting to authorities that have since his time 
become more or less discredited, speaks of 
Jeffreys as "constitutionally prone to igno- 
rance and to the angry passions," he is but 
just beginning the list of the chief justice's 
evil qualities. In his early practice at the bar 
of the Old Bailey, " daily conflicts with prosti- 
tutes and thieves called out and exercised his 
powers so effectually that he became the most 
consummate bully ever known in his profes- 
sion. All tenderness for the feelings of others, 
all self-respect, all sense of the becoming were 
obliterated from his mind. . . The profusion 
of maledictions and vituperative epithets 
which composed his vocabulary could hardly 
have been rivalled in the fish-market or the 
bear-garden. . . There was a fiendish exulta- 
tion in the way in which he pronounced 
sentence on offenders. Their weeping and im- 
ploring seemed to titillate him voluptuously; 
and he loved to scare them into fits by dilating 
with luxuriant amplification on all the details 
of what they were to suffer." This lavishing 
of the historian's wealth of rhetoric upon one 
who was doubtless equally liberal in airing 
his vocabulary in the courts of law does not, 
to say the least, make for somnolence in the 
reader. As the popular opinion of "Bloody 
Jeffreys" was already far from complimen- 
tary when Macaulay's work appeared, this 
valiant thwacking of the odious wretch gave 
untold satisfaction to thousands of readers.

For vituperative energy, combined with all | 
the resources of erudition and reinforced by i 
the weight of a commanding personality, there 
is little in our literature to compare with 
Milton's famous reply, in his " Defense of the ! 
People of England," to Salmasius, the noted ! 
Leyden professor whose espousal of the cause 
of Charles I. had stirred the wrath of the ; 
Latin Secretary to the Commonwealth. When 
Milton says of his adversary's work, " I per- 
suaded myself, the extemporary rhymes of 
some antic jack-pudding may better deserve 
printing," he is at his mildest ; and even when 
he calls Salmasius " a vain and flashy man," 
and addresses him as " thou superlative fool," 
he does not attain the pitch of abuse to which 
he subsequently lashes himself. But in his very 
first paragraph he is sufficiently heated to 
write such sentences as this : " I would advise 
you not to have so good an opinion of your- 
self (for nobody else has of you) as to imagine 
that you are able to speak well upon any sub- 
ject, who can neither play the part of an 
orator, nor an historian, nor express yourself 
in a style that would not be ridiculous even in 
a lawyer; but like a mountebank's juggler, 
with big swelling words in your preface, you 
raised our expectations, as if some mighty mat- 
ter were to ensue; in which your design was 
not so much to introduce a true narrative of 
the king's story, as to make your own empty 
intended flourishes go off the better." And a 
little further on he adds : " I will tell you 
what the matter is with you. In the first 
place, you find yourself affrighted and aston- 
ished at your own monstrous lies; and then 
you find that empty head of yours not encom- 
passed, but carried round, with so many trifles 
and fooleries, that you not only now do not, 
but never did, know what was fit to be spoken, 
and in what method." This vigorous polemic 
was written, it is true, in Latin, in which it 
presents an appearance of perhaps greater 
seemliness and dignity than in the vernacular 
rendering ; but it illustrates a style no longer 
in vogue in our controversial literature, though 
whether it has given place to anything more 
worthy of admiration may be open to dispute. 

An eminent living writer has declared that 
no one should expect to accomplish anything 
in literature until he has first ruined his diges- 
tion. How much of Carlyle's fame he owes to 
his dyspepsia, one cannot accurately deter- 
mine; but his works contain an excess of 
invective that probably would have had no 



place there if he had been a eupeptic person. 
In all this amazingly fluent and varied and 
picturesque tirade, however, there, is a quality 
of artistic detachment, of humorous gusto 
even, without which these atrabilious outpour- 
ings would be offensive, or merely wearisome, 
instead of entertaining and stimulating. In 
his "Latter-Day Pamphlets," with what wealth 
of disparaging language the doughty pam- 
phleteer exposes the ineptitude of Downing 
Street! If he had been born on the west in- 
stead of the east side of St. Patrick's Channel 
he could scarcely have been more uncom- 
promisingly " agin the government " as may 
appear from a few random sentences. Con- 
cerning the solemn mummeries of the " strange 
Entities" in Downing Street he says, with 
characteristic opulence of imagery: "How 
the tailors clip and sew, in that sublime sweat- 
ing establishment of theirs, we know not : that 
the coat they bring us out is the sorrowfulest 
fantastic mockery of a coat, a mere intricate 
artistic network of traditions and formalities, 
an embroiled reticulation made of web-listings 
and superannuated thrums and tatters, endur- 
able to no grown Nation as a coat, is mourn- 
fully clear ! " The one invariable attribute of 
those who are set in high places to govern 
those beneath them, is stupidity. "For em- 
pires or for individuals there is but one class 
of men to be trembled at; and that is the 
Stupid Class, the class that cannot see, who 
alas are they mainly that will not see. A class 
of mortals under which as administrators, 
kings, priests, diplomatists, etc., the interests 
of mankind in every European country have 
sunk overloaded, as under universal night- 
mare, near to extinction; and are indeed at 
this moment convulsively writhing, decided 
either to throw off the unblessed super-incum- 
bent nightmare, or roll themselves and it to 
the Abyss." 

Among more recent masters of the pugna- 
cious style, one of the most enjoyable to read, 
and one in whom an irresistible drollery of 
humor never fails to mask any possible sub- 
stratum of malevolence, is the author of that 
spirited defence of Harriet Shelley, which was 
evoked by Dowden's admired biography of this 
unhappy lady's poet-husband. Mark Twain, 
when moved to anger by any exhibition of 
arrogance or inhumanity, was capable of show- 
ing himself an antagonist whose pen was to be 
feared.

Our brilliant and ever-entertaining contem- 
poraries, Mr. Bernard Shaw and Mr. G. K. 
Chesterton, naturally come to mind in this 
connection as notable exponents of the literary 
style here under consideration. Perhaps the 
dominant note of these two, especially of Mr. 
Shaw, might be indicated by the misquotation 
from Pope, "Whatever is, is wrong." The 
world is all at fault and needs to be scolded 
and ridiculed and paradoxed into right con- 
duct. Mr. Chesterton's recent vigorous on- 
slaught on the Prussians leaves no doubt as 
to his mastery of incisiveness. Mr. Shaw's 
infinity of resource when the perversities and 
asininities of his fellow-men require castiga- 
tion at his hands is too well known to call for 
comment or illustration. 

Although little of lasting value is ever 
accomplished by unbridled vehemence of in- 
vective, yet it may be assumed as certain that 
not until human nature shall cease to be what 
it now is, and not until the occurrence of a 
dog-fight in the street shall fail to draw an 
eager crowd of spectators, will the pugnacious 
style, as employed by a master of sarcastic 
vituperation, cease to be accounted an agree- 
able stimulus to the jaded senses, provided 
only one be not the conscious object against 
which this battery of abuse is directed.

FRENCH LITERATURE AND THE WAR. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 
One of the curious consequences of the war 
has been the suspension, in France at least, 
of the publication of many books which were 
on the point of appearing when the cloud 
burst. Let me give a few examples of this 
which have come under my personal observa- 
tion, as they throw a side light, which has 
many odd reflections, on this terrible conflict. 
M. Jean G. Prod'homme, who is one of the 
best authorities in France on everything con- 
nected with music and musicians, has been 
engaged for several years in bringing out in 
French, through Delagrave of Paris, the com- 
plete prose works of Richard Wagner, based 
on the German edition prepared by the com- 
poser himself between 1870 and 1883. M. 
Prod'homme's translation was to consist of 
twelve volumes. "I had corrected the final 
proofs of the tenth volume, when the war 
broke out," M. Prod'homme said to me the 
other day when I met him in uniform at 
present everybody in France is a soldier. 



"My publisher's printer is established at 
Lille, which has been in the hands of the Ger- 
mans from the earliest days of the hostilities, 
and I often wonder what they have done with 
our plates. It would be a strange commen- 
tary on German culture if hatred of things 
French should cause the destruction of the 
only French translation of their great 
master ! " 

The same publisher was engaged on a work 
in two volumes devoted to English and Amer- 
ican literature ( " Anthologie de la Litterature 
Anglaise"), whose author, M. Andre Koszul, 
is one of the most promising of the younger 
professors of the English department of the 
Sorbonne, but who, at the first sound of the 
guns, threw aside his university gown and 
donned the uniform of a second lieutenant, 
only to become a few days later a prisoner in 
Germany, where he is still in confinement. 
As though having an intuition of what was to 
happen, the dedication of the first volume of 
his work, published a few months before the 
war, was in these words, in English : " To 
one by my side, who, with her two little chil- 
dren, has now deserted the cozy Paris home 
because it is so lonely without him." 

The second volume of M. Koszul's work, 
which is to bring the review from the eight- 
eenth century down to the present day and 
which is all in type, contains sixty pages 
devoted to American literature, with extracts 
from the works of our principal authors, be- 
ginning with Franklin, then skipping to 
Irving and Cooper, and finally coming down 
to Mark Twain and Mr. Henry James. One 
of the last communications I had from this 
brilliant young scholar (who, if he wards off 
the diseases of the prison camp, will perhaps 
some day be a worthy successor of Legouis) 
before he started for the front, was a copy 
of his brief introduction to the American sec- 
tion of this second volume. A few extracts 
in translation, here made public for the first 
time, will be interesting perhaps: 

" When one thinks of the formidable growth of 
the United States, one may say perhaps that soon 
the English written, read, and most widely spoken 
will be the English not of England but of Amer- 
ica. . . Thus the literature of the English language 
is becoming less and less strictly the literature of 
England. More and more numerous are the writ- 
ers in English outside of England and who some- 
times even have foreign blood in their veins. . . 
For the moment, it seems that, after having fol- 
lowed a distinct line of its own, American litera- 
ture is now much more disposed to fraternize with 
that of England, and vice versa. . . The most 
notable literary movement in the rather confused 
ensemble is that which accompanied the grand 
philosophic and religious enfranchisement called 



1915]

rather pompously Transcendentalism, to which is 
attached the noble effort of Emerson. [At the 
beginning of his career, M. Koszul made a long 
and thorough study of the Concord School.] . . . 
Thanks to money, the universities, the libraries, 
and the special reviews of the United States are 
becoming the first in the world. . . America al- 
ready offers some creations which force themselves 
on the attention of Europe. In very different 
ways, Emerson in England and Whitman in Ger- 
many exercise perhaps not less influence than does 
Edgar Poe in France." 

What this Poe influence in France is most 
of us know; but we were to have been re- 
minded of it again, and in a most magisterial 
fashion, long ere this if the war had not 
checked, for the moment at least, the demon- 
stration. M. Andre Fontainas, the Franco- 
Belgian writer and poet, actually had in type 
when mobilization began his " La Vie d'Edgar 
Poe " (Paris: Mercure de France), which will 
now see the light only when peace comes and 
which promises to be the most important book 
yet published in France concerning Poe. M. 
Fontainas can speak with considerable au- 
thority, being an author of established repu- 
tation, associated with the early symbolists, 
whose name has appeared on the title-page of 
seven volumes of poetry, three novels, and a 
half-dozen other works devoted to art, biog- 
raphy, the theatre, etc. He is, furthermore, 
well acquainted with the English language 
and literature, and has translated into French 
parts of De Quincey, Keats, and Meredith. 
Referring to his forthcoming book, "while 
stricken to the heart's core by the ineffable 
woes of my misused native land," he writes 
to me as follows : 

" I have based my statements on more reliable 
and completer documents than those possessed by 
Baudelaire or Stephane Mallarme, to whose memo- 
ries I dedicate my volume. I have tried to be very 
impartial, notwithstanding my profound admira- 
tion for the grand American poet whose glory is 
more wide-spread in some European countries than 
in his native land. I am quite ready to recognize 
the weaknesses and faults of Edgar Poe on many 
unfortunate occasions; but the conclusions which 
I draw therefrom are not marked by the severity, 
bias, I am almost led to say, of Mr. Woodberry." 

M. Fontainas concludes that Poe was not 
an habitual drunkard, or an alcoholist, or a 
dipsomaniac ; and, taking into consideration 
all the surrounding circumstances, he con- 
siders him to have revealed a " really heroic 
nobility of character." Nor does M. Fon- 
tainas accept Mr. Woodberry 's version of 
Poe's ignominious death; and to the accusa- 
tion that the poet's compositions were con- 
ceived " in the fumes of drunkenness and the 
hallucinations of opium," M. Fontainas op- 
poses the statement that "we have here a 



work of the purest kind of thought to be 
found in imaginative writing, where severe 
logic often plays a more important part than 
invention or caprice." 

Giving free rein to a resentment common 
in many literary circles in Europe against a 
certain puritanical estimate of Poe too often 
prevalent in our country, M. Fontainas in- 
dulges in this criticism: 

"Americans have not yet the intuition of what 
makes, in the opinion of certain English and 
French poets, artists and critics, the grandeur of 
their poet. They are too much wrapped up in 
positive and practical things not to be discon- 
certed by the singularity of an Edgar Poe or a 
Walt Whitman. They are shocked by the absence 
of utility in his work, by the lack of that didac- 
tism which he so vehemently attacked. They are 
not open to what Stedman already praised in 
him, ' the absolute love of beauty/ and are inclined 
to see in him only, as Emerson put it, ' the jingle- 
man.' They are all the more ready to accept the 
existence of his vices because these seem to be the 
cause of what disconcerts them in his work." 

The progress of Mme. Marcelle Tinayre's 
next novel, "La Route Secrete" (Paris: 
Calmann Levy), was also checked by the war. 
She was in Paris at the moment of the 
mobilization, and of course was carried off 
her feet, as were even many of us foreigners, 
by the magnificent manner in which the 
superb youth of France swept through the 
capital to the threatened front. What she 
then saw and felt, she has described in, "Le 
Depart" (Paris: Calmann Levy). But she 
is now at Toulon, in her retreat by the sea, 
deep in her story again, which, however, is 
to be given a turn not contemplated at first, 
as it will reflect the all-absorbing crisis 
through which Europe is passing, and which 
has struck down into this mother's heart in a 
peculiar way, for her seventeen-year-old boy, 
"a sculptor in embryo," catching the univer- 
sal fever, is clamoring " to go too." 

And it is this same calamity which contra- 
dicts the rumor that has appeared in several 
English and American literary journals that 
M. Edmond Rostand is engaged on a new 
volume of poems. " This is not the moment 
to try to court the Muses, at least for a 
Frenchman. Even war songs should not be 
inspired now." 

Even such a staid writer as M. Salomon 
Reinach is affected in the same way. The 
editor of the "Loeb Classical Library," Dr. 
T. E. Page, asked me, if I chanced to see 
M. Reinach (who, it will be remembered, gave 
Mr. Loeb the idea of founding this noble col- 
lection), to inquire when they might expect 
to have the manuscript of the promised 
"Lucan." M. Reinach's excuse for the delay 



358 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 28 



was much like the remark of M. Rostand, 
"the war has prevented my getting 1 started." 
Another minor preventive, but of quite an- 
other sort, also due to the war, will interest 
American readers, as it is a fresh and rather 
striking example of the attention which Eu- 
rope pays to our position in regard to this 
conflict. M. Reinach, in the midst of his many 
other tasks, finds time to prepare a series of 
little unbound volumes, " Voix Americaines " 
(Paris: Berger-Levrault, 60 centimes each), 
made up of translations and analyses of the 
best contributions from American pens about 
the war appearing in our periodicals and 
newspapers. Two of these excellent brochures 
have been issued, and a third is in press. 

Nor has the war hampered " The Loeb 
Library " only in the matter of a delay in the 
translation of "Pharsalia." Dr. Page writes 
me : " When I retired four years ago, I was 
looking forward to rest and some indepen- 
dent work, but Mr. Loeb's enterprise seemed 
to me so full of generosity and wisdom that 
I have attended to nothing else, except inci- 
dentally ; and though at the present time, the 
work can only be conducted imperfectly, I 
hope at any rate to see it through these trou- 
bled times"; and then, coming down to the 
more purely clerical side of the labor, he tells 
how "we have lost two secretaries who have 
enlisted, and have only partial use of a girl 
typist." And from Munich, where the war 
found him caring for his health, Mr. James 
Loeb writes : " My own experience proves 
that in troubled times such as the world is 
now experiencing, there is no better or more 
delightful refuge than the Greek and Latin 
classics afford." So if the war has checked 
the output of the presses for the moment, it 
has sent some of us back to the old books that 
never grow stale ; and thus we are enabled to 
escape the censure of Guizot when he says: 
" Ceux qui n'ont pas parcouru les etudes 
grecques et latines ne seront de toute leur vie 
que des parvenus en fait d'intelligence."

CASUAL COMMENT. 



HIGHER LEARNING AS AFFECTED BY THE WAR 
is the subject of a thoughtful article by Presi- 
dent Thwing in the latest number of " The 
Hibbert Journal." Some readjustments and 
changes are inevitably taking place in the 
educational field, and there will be others in 
the near future ; but any serious or permanent 
arrest of the advancement of learning seems 
not to be feared bv the writer or by those 



other observers whom he quotes, though there 
is likely to be a loss of prestige in certain 
quarters that might be pointed out by a self- 
confident prophet surveying the university 
world. Certain studies, such as history, di- 
plomacy, and international law, will probably 
be stimulated, and it may well be that the 
study of certain modern languages, with their 
literature, wnll receive- a fresh impetus, per- 
haps at the expense of a certain other, or 
others, in a manner not unconnected with the 
final issue of the struggle. The compilation 
of opinions presented by Dr. Thwing is found 
by him to illustrate " several great truths," 
and foremost among them the following : " It 
illustrates the intimacy of the ties binding 
nation to nation. These ties are not simply 
diplomatic understandings and political alli- 
ances. They are also great relationships cov- 
ering every part of the life of man. No nation 
can say to another nation, ' I have no need of 
thee.' The relations are the growth of gen- 
erations of struggle and of mingled fellow- 
ship and enmity. Any breaking of these ties 
throws each of these relationships out of its 
proper place. Education among them is thus 
made to suffer. Its place in the sun is thus 
obscured, its laws are broken, and its work- 
ings interrupted." Woeful is the damage to 
the things of the higher life, as any writer on 
the f topic chosen by Dr. Thwing must have 
been forced to admit: but in the very fact 
that this damage is discerned and deprecated 
lies hope for ultimate reparation, so far as 
reparation is possible. 



" THE INSECTS' HOMER," as Henri Fabre 
has often been called, with ascription of the 
epithet to Victor Hugo's poetic invention, has 
died at the age of nearly ninety-two. Provence, 
the country of Mistral, who discovered him 
in the obscurity and poverty that were almost 
his lifelong portion, and who procured for 
him a modest pension from the government, 
was the scene of his birth and death and the 
loving study that he devoted to the bees and 
spiders and other insects. Born of poor and 
uneducated parents, Fabre struggled with 
poverty from the beginning and was forced 
to acquire as best he could the excellent edu- 
cation in natural science that his writings 
show him to have possessed. Teaching, of the 
least attractive and poorest-paid sort, was the 
industry to which he turned for support as 
soon as he could meet its requirements. The 
chair of physics at the college of Ajaccio. 
with a salary of not more than eighteen hun- 
dred francs, and. later, a similar position at 
the Lycee of Avignon, were held by him for 
a while ; but his true vocation was entomologi- 



1915] 



THE DIAL

cal study, with occasional ventures into lit- 
erature as the poetic interpreter of the 
insects' habits. His "Souvenirs Entomolo- 
giques" embrace the greater part of these 
reports from the insect world, though shorter 
studies appeared from time to time in various 
periodicals. In our own language have been 
issued a number of works under his name, 
but compiled with some freedom by others 
from the body of his writings. Thus he is 
known to English readers for his " Social Life 
in the Insect "World," "Bramble-Bees and 
Others," " The Life and Love of the Insect," 
"The Life of the Fly," "The Life of the 
Spider," and " The Mason-Bees." The poetic 
and imaginative quality of his writing raises 
him to a place high above all other author- 
naturalists. 



HOW TO BE HAPPY THOUGH REJECTED (not as 

a lover, but as a writer for the magazines) 
may be learned from an engagingly frank edi- 
torial confession to be found in " The Unpop- 
ular Review " for the current quarter. After 
describing, probably with some exaggeration, 
his nearly uniform unsuccess for twenty years 
as a would-be contributor to magazines, and 
after admitting the worldly unwisdom of so 
lavish an expenditure of stationery and j 
stamps, the editor continues : " But the charm j 
of literary ambition is in its lack of wisdom. 
One must exercise common-sense in earning 
the livelihood ; in the quiet of the study, with 
fair paper and an easy pen, one may lock 
common-sense out of doors. Delightful is it, 
after a day of compromises, to let one's own 
notions have play. That conceit, laughed at 
by nobody, will appeal to the editor, once it is 
set down with reserve and climax. That bit 
of eloquence, debarred from the casualness of 
society, will find its way home in print. Alas, it 
too comes back to my drawer of rejections, no 
longer inspiring." But " Writing as a Sport " 
is the topic in hand, and so it must be remem- 
bered that " if sports had not their pains and 
hardship, they would not be sports." The 
writer even holds that " there is a richer expe- 
rience in getting a manuscript back than in 
winning any other game. In no other game 
may one lose so handsomely." Writing often 
serves as a safety-valve, and the failure to 
appear in print does not much matter. "A 
man who has confided his dearest theories to 
an editor and promptly got them back is a 
better neighbor. He is never quite the same 
man : he is. somehow, vastly improved." 
Therefore it is urged upon all who have ideas 
pressing for utterance to "write them down 
and send them off for print." or, more likely, 
for rejection. No malice lurks behind this ad- 



vice, for, says the writer, " rejection has stead- 
ied us and made us more thoughtful. It has 
lessened conceit, improved the temper, made 
us more kindly to the race, and turned us to 
the vital work we can do well. And that is 
surely the test of sport." After this the editor 
of " The Unpopular Review " ought to have 
no idle hours for lack of manuscripts to reject. 


THE POTENCY OP STYLE, in literature, is 
such that it can often so dazzle the reader as 
to make him blind to the lack of thought and 
invention behind it. Naturally no self- 
respecting person likes to find himself thus 
imposed upon, and the bare suspicion of 
fraud, however unfounded, will not seldom 
excite hostility against the stylist. One of 
Mr. Henry James's distinguished contempo- 
raries, himself a writer quite different in 
manner from the author of "The Golden. 
Bowl," has rather wittily though not with 
the keenest discernment remarked that Mr. 
James reminds him of an intelligent elephant 
vainly trying to pick up a pea that has rolled 
into the corner of its cage. Is it perhaps 
some lack of humor in Mr. James that makes 
it possible to say such a thing about him? 
Another stylist, of another nation, a poet and 
romancer very much in the limelight just 
now, is the author of the " Canzone dei Dar- 
danelli," the Italian patriot for whose cap- 
ture the Austrian government is said to have 
offered a reward of twenty thousand crowns, 
the people's idol at whose feet they prostrate 
themselves in an ecstasy of adoration un- 
mixed with any suspicion that those feet may 
be of clay. And yet Signer d'Annunzio's 
critics maintain that there is nothing but 
style to anything he has written. Is it pos- 
sible that the mere trick of words, which this 
brilliant Italian certainly possesses, can raise 
one to such heights of popular favor ? To the 
winnowing hand of time it can safely be left 
to determine what else there is in the product 
of his pen; but even now it is clear enough 
that one who takes himself with such tremen- 
dous seriousness, and in so dramatic a man- 
ner, is not exactly rich in the saving grace of 
humor. 

PHILOLOGICAL FRENZY, together with mania 
of a less interesting sort, seems to have pos- 
sessed that asylum inmate who astonished 
and delighted the late editor of the Oxford 
Dictionary by sending him, first and last, be- 
tween five thousand and eight thousand quo- 
tations useful in his great work. Dr. W. C. 
Minor, the eccentric philologist in question, 
was (or perhaps we should say is) an Amer- 
ican surgeon who served in his professional

capacity in our Civil "War, became a victim 
to periodic fits of insanity, shot a man, a 
stranger to him, in one of these fits, but was 
acquitted on the grounds of insanity, and 
was confined in the Broadmoor Criminal 
Lunatic Asylum, where Dr. Murray, to his 
intense surprise, found him. In the preface 
to the Dictionary Dr. Minor's services to that 
work receive due acknowledgment. In our 
own experience, si parva licet componere mag- 
nis, a certain mad philologist, a frequent 
sender of unsolicited comments and criticisms 
upon literary usages of the day, has demon- 
strated the possibility of retaining a more or 
less sane interest in scholarly pursuits after 
sanity in some other respects has departed 
and confinement in an asylum has been found 
necessary. In fact, this philological bent has 
a way of manifesting itself in all sorts of 
unlikely quarters. No less a celebrity than 
the present editor of the above-named diction- 
ary, Dr. Henry Bradley (if he will pardon 
the mention of his name in this connection), 
began life as clerk in a Sheffield hardware 
house, with the most meagre sort of school 
education behind him. Yet he rose rapidly 
to eminence in his chosen specialty, edited 
" The Academy " at one time, contributed to 
that and other leading periodicals, thrice 
served as President of the Philological So- 
ciety, was made a Fellow of the British Acad- 
emy, and achieved many other distinctions in 
addition to that of being chosen joint editor 
and then editor-in-chief of the greatest dic- 
tionary ever attempted (with success) of any 
language. If the son of a miller and clerk 
to a hardware dealer can accomplish these 
things, who shall say that philological hon- 
ors are not open to all competitors? 


STATISTICS CONCERNING THE BOOK-READING 
HABIT among our own people are communi- 
cated to " The Library Journal " by Mr. E. W. 
Mumford of the Penn Publishing Company. 
Whereas the head of the Macmillan Company 
has deplored, in the pages of " The Atlantic 
Monthly," what he would have us believe to be 
a decline in the reading of good books and an 
increasing resort to frivolous amusements, his 
Philadelphia contemporary sees unmistakable 
signs of exactly contrary tendencies. For 
example, the February number of " New York 
Libraries" reported the free library circula- 
tion of books in New York City for the decade 
ending in 1914 as nearly twelve millions in 
excess of that for the preceding decade, and 
the Central Building alone shows a gain in 
circulation for one year of more than a mil- 
lion, with a gain in the use of reference books 
amounting to nearly half a million. In Wis- 



consin one hundred and thirteen libraries of all 
sizes show collective gains of about seventy- 
five per cent in seven years. The city of Wash- 
ington increased its book-circulation by one 
hundred and fifty-six per cent in the last 
decade. And so on. Certainly there is little 
ground for absolute despair in the present 
trend, however wide the gap between what is 
and what ought to be in such matters. 



A LEXICOGRAPHER'S LAMENT comes to our 
attention in the reported utterance of Mr. 
F. Sturges Allen, General Editor of the 
famous dictionary that still bears the name 
of Noah Webster, who has been dead seventy- 
two years. "It's a strange thing," says Mr. 
Allen, with that fondness for the good old 
things of our youth that grows upon us as the 
years pass, " how the late generations are get- 
ting away from the old language, from the 
old figures of speech. The old simplicity, 
almost poetry, of nature images is going from 
ordinary conversation. Slowly, too, it is 
going from poetry. I don't believe the world 
to-day could produce a Spenser." Of course 
not. Each generation speaks its own tongue, 
and the present age could no more produce 
a Spenser than his century could have given 
birth to a Kipling. One may regret, and with 
good reason, the carelessness, the laxity, one 
might almost say the irreverence, that are 
always threatening to make a shapeless wreck 
of our native language; but the designs of 
the wreckers never quite succeed, though they 
always attain a measure of success. A later 
remark of Mr. Allen's shows that even he is 
by no means devoid of hope for the future. 
Asked if he did not detect signs of danger 
"that the poetical qualities of the race are 
being rubbed off by machinery, that the 
poetical qualities may ultimately be lost," he 
replied with both good sense and a sane op- 
timism: "Oh, bosh! The poetry of life is 
life itself." 

A QUESTIONABLE ECONOMY has begun to 
show itself in the administration of public 
libraries in England. It is true that with an 
income tax of a crown in the pound sterling, 
and likely to go higher, tax-payers must con- 
tribute with diminished zeal toward the sup- 
port of the local library, but on the other 
hand the public library provides the least 
expensive and most wholesome form of popu- 
lar entertainment that can anywhere be 
found, and entertainment the people must 
have, of some sort, war taxes or no war taxes. 
At the recent meeting of the Library Associa- 
tion (of England) disclosures were made that 
presaged ill for the immediate future, at

least, of the public libraries of our British 
cousins. Current fiction is naturally the first 
to be struck off from the book-purchasing list, 
and it is feared that the more expensive of 
serious publications will follow. This latter 
retrenchment would be cause for regret, how- 
ever willingly one might consent to the other 
reduction. Some more or less disastrous 
effects from the European war debauch are 
sure to show themselves in European libra- 
ries generally, if not also in our own ; for no 
smallest department of human activity seems 
wholly exempt. 

THE POETIC SERBIANS are presented in very 
attractive colors to their English allies by the 
ex-Minister from Serbia to the Court of St. 
James, Mr. Chedo Miyatovich. He asserts 
that "of all Slavonic nations the Serbians 
can legitimately claim to be the most poetical 
one. Their language is the richest and the 
most musical among all the Slavonic lan- 
guages. The late Professor Morfill, a man 
who was something of a Panslavist, repeat- 
edly said to me : ' I wish you Serbians, as 
well as all other Slavonic nations, to join 
Russia in a political union, but I do not wish 
you to surrender your beautiful and well- 
developed language to be exchanged for the 
Russian ! ' On one occasion he went even so 
far as to suggest that the future United States 
of the Slavs should adopt as their literary 
and official language the Serbian, as by far 
the finest and most musical of all the Slavonic 
tongues." Of somewhat questionable euphony 
might seem to an outsider a language abound- 
ing in such harsh geographical names as 
the present war has made familiar to our eyes, 
though not yet to our tongues. Those inter- 
ested in the Serbs and their capabilities in lit- 
erature are referred to Mr. W. M. Petrovitch's 
" Hero Tales and Legends of the Serbians," one 
of the books of the season, from the preface to 
which the passage above quoted is taken. 



A CONCESSION TO DELINQUENT BOOK-BORROW- 
ERS might, as a rule, encourage further delin- 
quency. On the other hand, a too rigorous 
enforcement of the rules relating to fines 
might drive an impecunious borrower away 
from the library. Let us call attention to 
what seems to be a wise exercise of discretion 
on the part of the Springfield (Mass.) libra- 
rian, who reports as follows : "A procedure in 
the case of children who have had overdue 
books and failed to pay the fees has been 
worked out satisfactorily. It seemed undesir- 
able to deprive a child of the use of the library 
because of his neglect, and yet to remit these 



fees would discourage children, from paying 
them and lead to consequent carelessness in 
returning books on time. In occasional W 
stances children have been allowed to balance 
the charge by giving an equivalent of work in 
the library, but in more cases the payment of 
fines by installments has proved beneficial. At 
least one youngster was heard to announce 
that he had given up the ' movies ' so that he 
could save the money to redeem his library 

card '"

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The warfare between facts and poetry, it has 
been said, is a conflict as irreconcilable as that 
between science and theology of which condi- 
tion there is much evidence to be adduced. New 
items thereof perpetually and uninterruptedly ac- 
cumulate, and the mass of it is more than moun- 
tainous it forms a world of itself. A very 
strange world, too or so such an item as that 
contributed to THE DIAL of October 14 by Miss 
Harriet Monroe would give us to believe. As this 
contribution is, moreover, in the nature of a reply 
to one of my own, entitled "Bryant and the New 
Poetry," which previously had appeared in your 
pages, I will perhaps be allowed sufficient of your 
space, not to " answer " it but to point out briefly, 
in justice to the illustrious name that figures so 
prominently (and to me so very strangely) in its 
context, some particulars in which it is indeed 
surprising. 

Doubtless it is a much better, a vastly more de- 
sirable thing, to be a live " new " poet than a dead 
great one. For the living bard or " bardess," as 
the case may be can not only write " new " 
poetry, but can in addition indulge in the pleasant 
and poetical pastime of belittling if not actually 
vilifying, of misrepresenting if not deliberately 
falsifying, not only the poetry but the probity of 
the mighty dead. And the mighty dead cannot 
perhaps rather luckily for the living little make 
reply, save as their works, which have lived after 
them, and the records of their lives (such as are 
extant), may speak. 

Now I have not the slightest disposition to 
believe that Miss Monroe wishes to be other than 
fair in her critical estimate of Bryant which 
we are all of us at liberty to acclaim or to repu- 
diate as our individual tastes and preferences may 
prompt. She has chosen to belittle him, that 
being, doubtless, in her opinion no more than 
his poetical pretensions deserve. Whether her 
" placing " of his poetry is correct or not only the 
reading of that poetry can establish. ' It, and it 
alone, can validly speak in its own behalf to those 
who care to hear. 

But it is quite another matter when we come to 
the facts of Bryant's life, to which Miss Monroe, 
in her communication above referred to, devotes 
considerable space, incidentally quoting from an 
editorial which previously she had contributed to 



362 



THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 28 



her own magazinelet, " Poetry." I will reproduce 
a portion of her remarks, as follows: 

" In that editorial I told of a publisher's statement 
that Bryant, toward the end of his long life, used to 
sell his name, along with his venerable portrait, as 
the author of books which he neither wrote nor edited, 
such as 'Bryant's History of the United States' and 
' Bryant's Collection of Poetry and Song,' to such an 
extent that he was known among New York publish- 
ers as ' the great national tone-imparter.' . . . 

" This story always comes back to me when I make 
the detour from Fifth Avenue to see the beautiful rear 
facade of the New York Public Library. Here a 
throned figure of the venerable poet faces the park 
named in his honor, and offers us his life as a high 
inspiration to American youth. To whose memory 
was the statue erected the poet of the Thanatopsis 
or the ' great national tone-imparter '? If the former, 
are we not honoring too much the man who did his 
best work at nineteen? and if the latter, are we not 
honoring too much the man who sold out? " 

Continuing in the same strain, Miss Monroe holds 
Bryant up to ignominy as an artist who was not 
" true to his vision " ; as one who " preferred to 
lead a comfortable life and be a good journalist 
rather than a poet, and so he descended from the 
serene nobility of Thanatopsis to the puerile pieties 
of the Hymn to the Sea, The Future Life, The 
Crowded Street and many other truly orthodox 
utterances. . . Bryant was, in short, a man born 
to be a poet who sacrificed the muse, not to those 
violent enemies, the flesh and the devil, but to that 
more insidious one, the world or, in other 
words, comfort and respectability." With much 
more to the same effect, to which the reader can 
readily refer in your issue of October 14. 

Now these would be very damaging assertions if 
true. But, as it happens, they simply are not 
true. It was Bryant himself who wrote that 
" Truth crushed to earth will rise again " ; and in 
the present instance, as regards him, I should like 
to hold out an assisting hand to Veracity as she 
arises from beneath the debris where Miss Monroe 
has inhumed her. 

Who was the very vague " publisher " who made 
the preposterous statement upon which Miss Mon- 
roe has based her still more preposterous ones? 
One would like to know, for he should write his 
own romances instead of publishing those written 
by other people. The allegation that Bryant 
" sold his name, along with his venerable portrait, 
as the author of books which he neither wrote nor 
edited, such as ' Bryant's History of the United 
States ' and ' Bryant's Collection [sic] of Poetry 
and Song ' " is so gross a misstatement as to be 
absurd. By " Bryant's Collection of Poetry and 
Song " I take it that Miss Monroe means " The 
Family Library of Poetry and Song, edited by 
William Cullen Bryant"; and it also occurs to 
me that when she is making such serious charges 
concerning a work she should at least know enough 
regarding the book itself to be able to quote its 
title correctly. As for the facts about this work 
a work so well known that it has run through 
many editions they are as follows: It was 
originally issued in 1870, and at once became 
widely popular, the demand for it being so insis- 
tent that a new edition, much enlarged, was got 



out in 1876, and in 1878 a third one, still again 
enlarged. It is a copy of this edition which for 
over twenty j r ears has held an honored place in 
my library, and turning to it I quote as follows 
from the " Publisher's Preface " : 

" Shortly before his death, observing with gratifi- 
cation the great popularity attained by his book and 
the growing demand for it, Mr. Bryant desired to 
thoroughly revise the work and make it still more 
worthy of the public esteem and his own fame. . . 
The enlargement and reconstruction of this work 
entailed upon Mr. Bryant much labor, in conscientious 
and thorough revision of all material, cancelling, 
inserting, suggesting, even copying out with his own 
hand many poems not readily attainable except from 
his private library in short, giving the work not 
only the sanction of his widely honored name, but also 
the genuine influence of his fine poetic sense, his 
unquestioned taste, his broad and scholarly acquain- 
tance with literature." 

This in itself settles the question regarding 
whether Bryant really edited his "Library of 
Poetry and Song " or merely " sold out " his 
name and portrait to the publishers as an adver- 
tising asset. But beyond that we have the lengthy 
Introduction with the sub-title, " Poets and Poetry 
of the English Language," written and signed by 
Bryant for the original edition; as well as the 
! similar preface which he also affixed to the second 
edition. 

So much for one of Miss Monroe's allegations. 
As for that regarding the second work, " Bryant's 
Popular History of the United States," concerning 
which she makes, on the authority of the same 
i unnamed publisher, similar charges, it dissolves 
! into thin air in the same manner when investi- 
gated. 

This history (aside from the lengthy signed his- 
torical preface) was never claimed to have been 
written by Bryant. It was in the main the work 
of Sidney Howard Gay, but there were numerous 
collaborators, among them writers as well known 
as Edward Everett Hale, E. L. Burlingame, etc., 
etc. And the connection of Bryant with the under- 
taking was very clearly and explicitly set forth in 
the preface to the second volume in the following 
terms: 

" To the first volume of this History, as well as to 
this, it is due to say that the oldest living and most 
distinguished American scholar, whose name it bears, 
has given to every line read in proof, before print- 
ing the benefit of his careful criticism, his ripe 
judgment and his candid discrimination." 

This second volume appeared almost coincidently 
with the death of the poet, in 1878; and as the 
two concluding volumes did not come from the 
press for some time, the final one not until 1882, 
there was absolutely no chance for any misappre- 
hension regarding Bryant's authorship. 

These facts and they are the unimpeachable 
ones reveal pretty fully, I think, the grotesque 
nature of Miss Monroe's remarks, and the totally 
; unwarranted character of her allegations regard- 
ing the " man who sold out." 

Let us now glance briefly at her further accusa- 
tion that Bryant " sacrificed the muse to the 
world, or, in other words, to comfort and respec- 
tabilitv." 



1915] 



THE DIAL

Bryant was born in 1794. His father was a 
country doctor in a tiny New England village, a 
man altogether admirable but without " an eye to 
the main chance." He was always in straitened 
circumstances to the day of his death, and his 
family found the most rigid economy a necessity, 
while his sons were forced to enter the struggle 
with the world with no resources except such as 
those which the force of heredity and the best 
up-bringing that their parents found it possible 
to provide had endowed them with. William 
Cullen, as Miss Monroe truly says, " was born a 
poet." But he was also born a human being, with 
the necessity of food, clothes, love, and a fireside. 
He first tried the law, and drilled away at it for 
a number of years. In his own words, at a time 
when his poetic genius was clamoring for utter- 
ance (the era of " Thanatopsis," " To a Water- 
fowl," " Fairest of the Rural Maids," " Summer 
Wind," "A Forest Hymn"), and 

" Each gaze at the glories of earth, sky and ocean 
To my kindled emotions was wind over flame," 

he was being 

" Forced to drudge for the dregs of men 
And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen." 

The struggle was a severe one and it was 
complicated by his early marriage and growing 
family. It was as impossible for a penniless New 
Englander to live by poetry alone, to say nothing 
of supporting a wife and family, in the United 
States of 1825 (or for many years afterward) as 
it is for a bee to gather honey from hornblende. 
" Thanatopsis " was written in 1811, the " Water- 
fowl " in 1815. The one waited seven years, the 
other four, for publication, finally appearing in 
1818 in the "North American Review" (then an 
obscure literary bantling), to which Bryant's 
father, who had found them in his son's desk, had 
sent them without the latter's knowledge. Their 
author received no payment for them; and when, 
three years later, their publication having caused 
him to be hailed as the first great American poet, 
he issued his first volume of verses, what was the 
result? Why, five years after its publication he 
had realized net profits, from the sales, of pre- 
cisely $14.92! 

Finally, in 1825, Bryant took a desperate step. 
He recognized that his vocation was literature, and 
that the only place in which its practice would 
yield him a livelihood was New York City; so 
there he removed, as, in his own phrase, " a lit- 
erary adventurer." Previous to this time, as a 
poet, he had been receiving the princely stipend 
of $200 a year for contributing to the " U. S. 
Literary Gazette " not less than one hundred lines 
of poetry each month. Miss Monroe can " figure 
it out for her herself," if she wishes to, as a prob- 
lem alike in poetical stimuli and domestic economy. 
At the same time Bryant sold his poems, wherever 
a market offered, for two dollars apiece ! 

In New York, leaving his family in the country, 
he grubbed along as best he might, and was having 
a bitter time of it financially, until at last chance 
threw in his way an associate editorship of the 
" Evening Post," which he accepted as one ship- 
wrecked does a friendly sail. It proved the turn- 



ing point of his fortunes ; but he had yet " a hard 
row to hoe." The paper was not then strongly 
established, and its value was small so small 
that four years later he was able to buy a con- 
trolling interest in it for $2,000, which he bor- 
rowed for the purpose. This was in 1829. Eight 
years later he thought it safe to undertake the 
European tour which he had long dreamed of; 
but returned to find that mismanagement during 
his absence had been such as to force him to go 
deeply into debt to straighten out the tangle, and 
to bind himself to the wheel again like " a 
draught horse harnessed to a drag," as he ex- 
pressed it. 

This is an outline of the manner in which 
Bryant, to quote the language of Miss Monroe, 
" sacrificed the muse to the world " and " sold 
out " his " name and venerable portrait " to pro- 
mote publications sailing under false colors in his 
old age. I do not offer this outline on the author- 
ity of some nameless New York publisher, but as 
attested historical fact of which the proofs are all 
of record. Unless all credible witnesses are at 
fault, if ever there was a poet whose personal 
probity was irreproachable that poet was William 
Cullen Bryant. If ever there was a poet who had 
a higher or more dignified conception of the nobil- 
ity and sacredness of poetry and the practice 
thereof or held more steadfastly to that concep- 
tion throughout his life, I have never heard of 
him. And, habituated as I have become to the 
reckless assaults which the " new " poetry makes 
upon the poetry of the past, it has been with a 
feeling not so much of surprise as of pain that I 
have found it necessary to thus come to the 
I defence of one whose name and whose fame, alike 
as a poet and as a man, should be a precious heri- 
tage to all the generations of Americans who shall 
come after him. JOHN L. HERVEY.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND CITIZENSHIP. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I wonder if the " vocation of enlightened citi- 
zenship " and " other vocations " are really such 
extremes as Dr. Showerman suggests in his arti- 
cle published in your issue of Sept. 30. I wonder 
if the ultimate end of liberal education is only the 
production of the ideal citizen and the ideal State. 
It is not conceded by all intellectual experts and 
educators that the State is the final end of life, or 
that citizenship is the only aim of education. The 
fundamental principle of democracy repudiates 
the assumption that the State is the end of 
education. 

That some business and professional men are 
handicapped by an incomplete knowledge of 
fundamentals cannot be denied. But that the 
handicap is due to an incomplete liberal education 
is an assertion not substantiated by the facts. It 
is true we have too many stenographers and 
printers and proofreaders who cannot be trusted 
with spelling, punctuation, and composition. It 
may be noted, however, that if these inefficient 
workers had enjoyed the benefits of vocational 
training instead of being bored by following the 



364 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 28 



dubiously helpful labyrinths of Latin conjugations 
and other dead high-school inheritances, they 
would know how to spell, to punctuate, and to 
write compositions. Had they been taught spell- 
ing, punctuation, and composition in a vocational 
class, organized for the definite purpose of pre- 
paring them for the occupations they were to 
pursue, instead of learning these branches in the 
dry, helpless, uninteresting method of the ordi- 
nary English class organized for an indefinite use 
in a still more indefinite future, there probably 
would be no occasion for this criticism. It is true 
that we have reporters, editors, and writers who 
use slip-shod English; it is true that many teach- 
ers are inefficient; and that numerous lawyers, 
physicians, and other professional men need ful- 
ness and rounding. But these defects can be 
remedied only by improving vocational training, 
not by inflating an already hazy education that 
leaves the victim of it hanging helpless in the air. 

Dr. Showennan's article leaves the impression 
that vocational training is not liberal or cultural. 
It cannot be denied that some vocational training 
is based on this lamentable principle. Usually the 
aim of cultural education is the cultivation of 
mental power and the acquisition of knowledge. 
A well-regulated vocational school teaching a bal- 
anced curriculum can accomplish this. It is not 
proved that a liberal education is the only means 
to secure mental power. It requires as much 
mental effort, as much hard thought, to assemble 
a gasoline motor as to assemble the dry bones of a 
dead language into a useless sentence or para- 
graph or composition. Moreover, in assembling a 
gasoline motor, or in making a table, or in baking 
a loaf of bread, we are learning something of the 
real everyday body of useful knowledge which is 
needed to turn the wheels of life. Vocational 
training supplemented by proper liberalizing stud- 
ies can accomplish more than a liberal education 
so called. The refinement of intellectual and spir- 
itual temper need not be lost. The perceptions 
may be deepened, and the vision broadened, by a 
curriculum that judiciously embodies the liberaliz- 
ing and spiritualizing elements of the old system 
with the usefulness of the new. 

After all, the day of poorly trained lawyers, 
preachers, and physicians, together with the atten- 
dant hosts in other professions, is rapidly passing. 
Yesterday, the day of liberal education, produced 
medical men whose education consisted of a year's 
study with a country practitioner. The long- 
suffering public then became the victims of his 
ignorance. It was during the regime of liberal 
education that a prospective lawyer could read a 
few law-books and pass the bar-examination. It 
was also during this regime that the preacher with 
an unspeakable theology and the questionable 
diploma of an indefinite something misnamed a 
"call," undertook the elevation of morals and 
religion. The tendency and influence of the new 
education resulted in legislation that eliminated 
the first two, and inspired a public opinion that is 
fast exterminating the third. 

Liberal education need not oppose vocational 
training. They may be made logical coordinates. 



We must preserve certain elements of both and 
discard others. Moreover, we must remember that 
the individual as well as the State must benefit 
by our system of education. On its social side, 
education aims at the preservation of the State; 
on its individual side, it aims to produce rounded 
as well as thoroughly equipped men and women. 
Let us not forget, however, that good citizenship 
is secured only when the individual is fitted to do 
his particular work. When we have cultivated 
mental power, broadened our vision, deepened 
our perceptions, and refined the intellectual and 
spiritual temper, we still fall short of fulfilling the 
duties of citizenship. We have hitched the horse 
only partly to the wagon. Citizenship implies 
efficiency to fill our place in the scheme of civil 
and social affairs, in other words, to accomplish 
with the skill that comes from special training, 
the work society gives us to do. To complete the 
figure, we must hitch to the cross-piece both tugs 
that draw the wagon. The great vocation needs 
both types of learning. QRVIS c

THE GEKMAN WAE BOOK AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Mr. Tannenbaum's somewhat acrimonious letter 
(in your issue of Sept. 30) on my review of " The 
War Book of the German General Staff " (issue 
of Sept. 2) might be allowed to pass harmlessly 
into oblivion, were it not that it ignores in an 
astonishing way a point which the reviewer had 
thought would be manifest to all. Mr. Tannen- 
baum asks, " Since when is the doctrine that neces- 
sity knows no law a German doctrine ? " The 
answer is obvious : since August 4, 1914, when the 
German Chancellor proclaimed it unqualifiedly in 
the Reichstag. Speaking of the invasion of Bel- 
gium, von Bethmann-Hollweg said on that occa- 
sion : " We are now in a state of necessity, and 
necessity knows no law." A little reflection will 
show that the doctrine is not synonymous with 
self-defence, as your correspondent seems to as- 
sume, but is a negative and euphemistic form of 
" might makes right." Human frailty, which is 
not confined to Germany, has made use of the plea 
in all ages and climes to cloak injustice, but the 
reviewer is not aware that any modern state save 
the present Imperial German Government has 
ever deliberately emblazoned that device on its 
escutcheon. 

As to charges of unfairness (and even of false- 
hood!) the reviewer would like to assure the read- 
ers of THE DIAL that the text of the War Book 
was reproduced literally in the two quotations. 
A score or more of other passages might have 
been cited with almost equal appositeness. The 
German General Staff speaks for itself in this 
book, and he who runs may read. 

For the rest it might be pointed out that Mr. 
Tannenbaum's comparison of the German War 
Book with the American Naval War Code breaks 
down in various ways. The regularly sanctioned 
usages of naval warfare differ from those of land 
warfare in certain important respects, as the na- 



THE DIAL 



365 



ture of things requires. A careful scrutiny of the 
two passages discloses also such differences of 
expression and implication in the American state- 
ment as will render probable a difference in the 
conduct of officers and men. The American navy, 
we are fain to think, would not be guilty of a 
" Lusitania " massacre. But the real heart of the 
matter is that the tu quoque or " you're another " 
argument, so liberally employed by Mr. Tannen- 
baum and other German apologists, is both ethi- 
cally untenable and practically futile. American 
indignation at the violation of Belgium, for exam- 
ple, not only should not but also will not be 
quenched by a reminder that America has mal- 
treated the Indians in the past. And it is well 
that this is so; if that form of argument were 
accepted as effectually silencing an opponent, all 
moral reprobation would cease and consequently 
all moral progress would be estopped. 

Oct. 16, 1915. THE REVIEWER. 



DE. VIZETELLY AND DIPHTHONGS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

May I call attention to a confusion of terms to 
be found on pages 290-291 of Dr. Frank H. Vize- 
telly's " Essentials of English Speech " which 
escaped the comment of your reviewer. He says: 

" We have been told that six of the symbols in the 
National Education Association alphabet are ' conso- 
nants replacing our present symbols/ which ' is unde- 
sirable since the sounds to be represented are clearly 
and adequately shown by our present letters.' This 
is not so our present letters do not show the diph- 
thongal characters of ch, sh, ng, th, and zh. The 
Committee of the National Education Association 
recommended the use of ties in certain of these sym- 
bols purposely to bring out this very diphthongal 
character. The amateur philologist, who declares 
these undesirable, even though he may have sat at 
the feet of the great professors of languages in the 
universities of Europe, simply shows colossal igno- 
rance as regards these digraphs. Every one of the 
great dictionaries has decided that the sound of these 
letters is diphthongal." 

Dr. Vizetelly then goes on to quote from the 
late Dr. William T. Harris to the effect that ch is 
diphthongal, " a combination of t and sh." This, 
of course, is true, and it is a fact which the 
N. E. A. alphabet does not in the least bring out 
by tying a c and an h together in a digraph. But 
what can Dr. Vizetelly mean when he calls sh, ng, 
th, and zh diphthongal, and says that " every one 
of the great dictionaries " has so decided ? 

On the contrary, there is no dictionary in En- 
glish, no authoritative phonetic statement in or 
out of a dictionary, which has not decided the 
direct reverse, that is, that the four sounds men- 
tioned (really five, since th stands for two differ- 
ent consonants) are monophthongs. Selecting the 
one consonantal diphthong out of the group of 
five (or six), and quoting Dr. Harris to prove that 
it is a consonantal diphthong, does not prove 
anything regarding the others, which are single 
sounds, sh the voiceless and zh the voiced open 
point teeth consonants of Mr. Sweet, th as in 
" thin " the voiceless, and th as in " then " the 
voiced open blade point consonants of the same 



authority, and ng his voiced back nasal consonant. 
The New English Dictionary gives them each a 
single character to that end, and there is no dis- 
senting voice among phoneticians anywhere. Will 
Dr. Vizetelly explain why he uses the term " colos- 
sal ignorance" of others in this connection? 

Chicago, Oct. 18, 1915. WALLACE RICE. 

THE AUTHOE OF " SANINE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am surprised that the Russian author Michael 
Artzibashef (he is really an admixture of five 
races) should be regarded as a so-called " prophet 
of pessimism," when he distinctly says that in his 
view the outlook of any student of humanity is lia- 
ble to continual change. " Each day, each hour 
even," he says, " has its message for us." 

It appears so plain to me that, while he is 
acutely sensible of the unfortunate environmtnt of 
thousands of human beings, and to what appears 
to be the injustice of their fate, he is only portray- 
ing a few individuals of the millions or billions 
of humanity. He has also said (in " Sanine ") that 
no one can get a right conception of life from 
books. I observe also that his critics are prone to 
mistake the sentiments he attributes to the passing 
emotions of his characters for his own opinions and 
beliefs, which is deplorable; and the liability to 
such misconstruction is accentuated in the transla- 
tion of his writings. 

It is gratifying, however, to find his American 
critics as a unit in recognizing the fact that he is 
essentially clean-minded. The character of Sanine, 
though a puzzle to some of the critics, is intended 
to show that no man can be sure of himself in the 
toils of temptation. And here he also presents one 
of the awful facts in life, the paralyzing power of 
a dominant will, call it hypnotism, mesmerism, or 
what you please. 

Some things that I have not seen commented 
upon (or only very lightly touched) are his admira- 
ble restraint and his remarkable gift of word paint- 
ing. He has told of his grief at not being able to 
devote his life to painting upon canvas; but he 
possesses the great gift of handling words as col- 
ors, and his books are worth reading for this alone. 
We also observe his extreme sensitiveness to sounds 
and odors, his love of music, and his response to the 
tones of the speaking voice. Not the slightest sigh 
of the breeze or tremor of the leaves escapes him.

RECOLLECTIONS OF A PUBLISHER ANI) 
MAN OF ACTION.* 

The activities of Mr. George Haven Put- 
nam have been so multifarious that it is diffi- 
cult to pick out the central strand of his life. 
As a publisher, as a sort of unofficial agent 
to preserve the intellectual comity of England 
and the United States, as a worker for Civic 
Reform, as Secretary of the International j 
Copyright League, he has done a full stint of j 
work, and may be said to be coming home i 
to-day, " bringing his sheaves with him." 

The first instalment of Mr. Putnam's auto- 
biography, published early last year under j 
the title "Memories of My Youth," brought ; 
the narrative of the author's life to the com- j 
pletion of his twenty-first year and the close I 
of the Civil War. The volume now published, j 
"Memories of a Publisher," deals with the 
ensuing half century of time. It is mainly a 
bundle of little essays sketches in biog- 
raphy of some of the remarkable personalities 
with whom the author has come into contact. 

"Hands across the sea" has been one of 
the mottoes of Mr. Putnam's life, and some 
of the pleasantest chapters of his book are 
what might be termed a cross-section of the 
intellectual life of England as represented at 
the great universities. Many of the digni- 
taries and scholars of Oxford and Cambridge 
are the subjects of illuminating sketches. 
The dons seem to have put off their donnish- 
ness in Mr. Putnam's company, and become 
really human. In this connection, it may be 
noted that he has repaid his hosts by a strong 
advocacy of their cause in the present crisis. 
In the appendix to this book are collected the 
strong letters he has written to the public 
prints about the causes and conduct of the 
war. In particular he has repudiated, most 
earnestly, any possible parallel between the 
acts of the Union army and the German 
atrocities in Belgium. 

"We fancy that Mr. Putnam's preference is 
rather for action and men of affairs than for

first choice of a profession was forestry, and 
he gave three years of his early life to soldier-

should take the inclination of the twig. He

reformers in public affairs, and indeed puts

in these pages of Carl Schurz, Grover Cleve- 
land, William H. Baldwin, Henry Villard, 
Roger A. Pryor, Joseph H. Choate, and many 
other leaders of opinion. 

Mr. Putnam's prose is always easy and 
limpid, and sometimes sparkling. Here is a 
passage describing the launching of a cele- 
brated leviathan of fiction : 

" One afternoon, some time in the winter of 
1880, just as I was preparing to close my desk, a 
young lady and her father came in, the latter bur- 
dened with an enormous package of manuscript. 
The daughter was about twenty, and admitted that 
this was her first attempt at literary production. 
The father did most of the talking, but his state- 
ment that the story that his daughter had pro- 
duced was certain to attract widespread attention 
was a word that is listened to so often in a pub- 
lishing office that it did not impress me very 
seriously. I could only dismiss my callers with 
the word that the manuscript would receive care- 
ful attention. The great amount of the material, 
the admitted inexperience of the author, even the 
detail that the script had been written, not in ink 
but in pencil and on yellow instead of white 
sheets, gave a pretty strong impression against the 
probability that the story possessed any publish- 
ing importance. I put a few of the first chapters 
into my bag and began the reading rather late in 
the evening when I had gotten through with other 
matters. I found myself annoyed, notwithstand- 
ing the troublesome strain on my eyes from the 
pencil script, that I had not brought home more 
chapters. The old man was right in his contention 
that the manuscript would attract at once the 
attention of the reader, for the book was the 
famous 'Leavenworth Case,' and the murder, 
the solution of which constitutes the problem of 
the story, occurs in the second chapter. The narra- 
tive was absorbing, but its exceptional compass 
made it difficult, if not impossible, to manage on 
ordinary publishing lines. As first written ' The 
Leavenworth Case ' contained about 200,000 words. 
In arranging for another call from the father and 
daughter, I expressed my cordial interest and at 
the same time pointed out the difficulty from a 
business point of view in the management of such 
an elephant of a romance. With a good deal of 
protest Miss Green accepted the task of elimi- 
nating certain portions of the narrative, but it 
was as if she had undertaken to cut up a baby. 
Twice did the manuscript go back for curtailment, 
but as finally printed the volume still contained 
160,000 words." 

There is less in Mr. Putnam's book about 
the publishing enterprises of his firm than 
might be expected. Considerable space is 
devoted to an account of the publication of 
the series of " Writings of the Fathers of the 
Republic," which may fairly be called among 
the major undertakings of the kind in this 
country. It covers the writings of Washing- 
ton, Franklin. Hamilton, Madison, Monroe, 
Samuel Adams, George Mason. Thomas Paine,

and Lincoln. Later the firm published the 
"International Series," the "International 
Science Series," the "Story of the Nations" 
series, and the " Heroes of the Nations " series. 

Mr. Putnam has issued a fair shelf-full of 
books of his own. In 1893 he brought out 
"Authors and Their Public in Ancient 
Times," a work which, though based on Ger- 
man scholarship, is valuable because it covers 
ground hardly touched upon in English. 
Later, he added a study of "Books and 
Their Makers in the Middle Ages," which is 
largely an investigation as to how far the 
Church, with its two sets of Indexes, Pro- 
hibitory and Expurgatory, interfered with 
authorship and publication in Europe. In 
1909 there appeared from his pen a biograph- 
ical study of Lincoln. An illustrated frivol- 
ity entitled " The Gingerbread Man " has had 
something of a popular success. The memoir 
of his father and the two volumes of his own 
"Memories" complete the tale of Mr. Put- 
nam's contributions to literature. 

We have left to the last what many people 
will consider Mr. Putnam's most important 
service. He inherited from his father the 
interest in and the lion's share of the work of 
furthering International Copyright. The 
two of them seem to have borne the brunt of 
the fight for this important reform. As he 
points out, the wrongs were not all on one 
side. English publishers were just as free in 
"conveying" anything they wanted from 
American writers as our pirates were in deal- 
ing with English publications, only they 
did not want so much. The whole question 
of copyright is still on an unsubstantial and 
illogical basis. If any property at all is 
sacred it would seem to be those estates that 
writers conjure up out of their own minds. 
However, for the considerable protection thus 
far secured, authors both in this country and 
abroad owe much to the self-sacrificing labors 
of Mr. Putnam and his associates.

THE MAKTXG OF AMERICA.* 



Each year brings forth a constantly in- 
creasing number of special studies in the 
field of American history. These investiga- 
tions, some of which are exceedingly careful 
monographs confined to limited periods, add 
to the general knowledge of the subject and 
consequently modify the views of students. 

THE RIVERSIDE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Com- 
prising: Beginnings of the American People, by Carl L. 
Becker ; Union and Democracy, by Allen Johnson ; Expan- 
sion and Conflict, by William E. Dodd ; The New Nation, by 
Frederic L. Paxson. With maps. Boston : Hough ton Mif- 
flin Co. 



It is therefore desirable that these revised 
judgments and newly discovered facts should, 
at more or less regular intervals, be gath- 
ered, sifted, weighed, and woven into a re- 
statement of what may be, in essence, an old 
story. For this reason the authors of the 
"Riverside History of the United States" 
have undertaken "to describe in proper pro- 
portions and with due emphasis . . the 
forces, influences, and masterful personali- 
ties which have made the country what it is." 
This is no small task which they have at- 
tempted, for the growth of the American 
people cannot be treated as the simple and 
steady development of a nation, the various 
parts of which have been in harmonious 
accord as to ideals political, social, eco- 
nomic, or intellectual and the methods of 
realizing them. On the contrary, this growth 
has been an unsteady one, because sectional 
prejudices have been slow in giving way to 
national sentiment. 

Professor Becker, who contributes the vol- 
ume on " The Beginnings of the American 
People," writes from the viewpoint of the 
student of European history, and for this 
reason his work is of more than passing 
interest. He sees the colonies as parts of the 
European system. His thorough understand- 
ing of European political affairs, of social 
conditions and ideals, and particularly of the 
economic theory of the age, enables him to set 
forth in a remarkably clear and compact, but 
at the same time exceedingly entertaining 
way, the narrative of the three hundred 
years with which he deals. 

Generally the works on American colonial 
history which come to the hand of the average 
reader lack this broader interpretation which 
is so essential to the proper understanding of 
the period. It is true that the facts pertain- 
ing to the founding of the colonies, their 
growth, and the development of their insti- 
tutional life are known, as are the incidents 
connected with the French occupation of and 
expulsion from America. So, too, are the 
issues which developed in the last half of the 
eighteenth century, and which ended in the 
severing of our connections with the mother- 
country. But they are known from the 
standpoint of the American colonist. It is by 
no means damaging to one's Americanism to 
examine the problems of this period from the 
standpoint of the British imperialists whom 
circumstances forced into the position of 
empire-builders. Viewing questions of pol- 
icy, as they did, in this light, it is reasonable 
to assume that their views surpassed in 
breadth those of many of the colonial leaders 
of the day, who, hampered by local pre-

judices, drifted toward provincialism and 
particularism. 

Professor Becker shows clearly that eco- 
nomic theory was at the bottom of the earlier 
colonial policy of England, as well as the 
later imperialistic policy. The cardinal doc- 
trine of the age was that to be politically 
independent a nation must be self-sufficing. 
In the nation dependent upon rivals for the 
necessities, not only the prosperity of the 
trading class was threatened, but the very 
life of the nation itself. When the English 
merchants, in the age of Elizabeth, began to 
bewail the lack of markets, the chartered 
trading and colonizing companies came into 
existence. So it appears that the dependence 
upon foreign countries for various commodi- 
ties, coupled with the decline of the English 
export trade, gave rise to the colonizing move- 
ment. Other influences contributed to the 
founding of the English plantations in Amer- 
ica, but economic causes were of primary 
importance. 

As the colonies grew in commercial and polit- 
ical importance, the English statesmen came 
to feel more and more strongly that these na- 
tional investments should be made paying 
ones. They determined to regulate the com- 
mercial and political activities of these small 
states, not with any idea of limiting their 
growth or prosperity, but because they be- 
lieved that through regulation the greatest 
good would result to the greatest number of 
English subjects. Thus the numerous regu- 
lating acts passed prior to 1765 were attempts 
to foster the commerce and industries of the 
whole nation at the expense of foreign coun- 
tries, and to develop colonial industry along 
lines which would not come into competition 
with English industry. 

The overthrow of France in the New "World 
brought some weighty problems to England. 
The latter country became an empire in terri- 
torial extent, but in territorial extent only; 
for it lacked all the administrative machinery 
necessary for the consolidation and control 
of a political organism so vast. The attempts 
to create an administrative system capable 
of regulating the internal and external rela- 
tions of this empire were of necessity experi- 
mental in character, and were certain to meet 
with opposition wherever imperial interests 
ran counter to those of the small and widely 
scattered political units which heretofore had 
managed their own affairs according to their 
own inclinations. To assure a more perfect 
union, the political system must be over- 
hauled, and any such reorganization would 
of necessity tend to limit the chartered rights 
of the American plantations. Any reorgani- 



zation of the commercial system something 
which was demanded by the powerful mer- 
chant class now so important in English 
affairs was certain to interfere with the 
profits of the commercial class in the colonies. 
The enlargement of territorial holdings 
meant a decided increase in the size of the 
army; the reorganization of the administra- 
tive machinery meant the creation of numer- 
ous offices. The increased operating expenses 
could be met only by heavier taxation, a part 
of which the colonies would be expected to 
bear. 

Upon these points of imperial policy was 
based the opposition to the mother-country. 
One can scarcely deny that from a legal point- 
of view the English statesmen had right upon 
their side. Lack of tact, however, and a 
stubborn disregard for the prejudices of the 
provincials, turned passive resistance into a 
revolt which rent asunder the imperial state 
the English lords were trying so earnestly to 
mould into an indestructible unit. 

It is not to be wondered at that the mother- 
country could not win the undivided support 
of the American colonies for her imperialistic 
policy. The colonies had difficulties in agree- 
ing among themselves on any subject. When 
it was scarcely possible for Puritan, Angli- 
can, Calvinist, Quaker, and Catholic to live 
together in peace in this age of rancorous 
religious prejudice, it was highly improbable 
that these elements would gather themselves 
together into a single state without a decided 
struggle. Moreover, the geographical environ- 
ments of these groups were such as would 
intensify rather than diminish the prejudices 
of each, since economic differences, so power- 
ful in influencing the formation of political 
beliefs, were bound to develop. So it was 
that physiographic conditions, together with 
certain definite religious and political beliefs, 
developed a political, social, and economic 
unit in colonial New England which differed 
radically from the unit developed in Vir- 
ginia. Communication, except by sea, was 
well-nigh impossible; and each colony, devel- 
oping along its own lines, nursing its own 
prejudices, and exalting its own ideals, strove 
to become sufficient unto itself. Commerce, 
the great agency for the widening of men's 
minds, had little opportunity to exert its 
powerful influence upon these isolated bodies 
politic of seventeenth century America. 

In the course of events, a common danger 
from without compelled the colonies to bury 
their differences long enough to win inde- 
pendence and a place among the nations of 
the earth. The treatment which Professor 
Becker accords to the Revolution is not the

one generally set forth for American readers. 
It is impossible not to receive the impression 
that even the few successes gained by the 
poorly organized colonial armies in the early 
years of the war were due not so much to the 
patriotism of the American people as to the 
studied inactivity of the British generals. 

" The ministers [of England] had doubtless 
thought that the policy of conducting the war with 
the olive branch and the sword in either hand 
would prove successful. Certainly Howe had so 
interpreted his instructions. He had fought only 
when it was necessary to fight; easily accom- 
plished everything he seriously attempted; never 
pressed an advantage; had supposed that by occu- 
pying the principal cities, affording protection to 
the loyal, and by moderation winning the luke- 
warm, the flame of rebellion would burn low for 
want of fuel and in good time quite flicker out." 
As it was, the colonial army looked with con- 
tempt upon a government which could 
neither feed nor clothe its soldiers; Congress 
criticized the army for weakness, and feared 
it when it threatened to usurp congressional 
powers. The states wanted to control their 
own troops and direct their activities; fur- 
thermore, they tried to dodge taxes and to 
leave their quotas unfilled. Here and there 
a fortunate victory aided the cause of the 
colonies; the French alliance gave new life 
to a weakened resistance ; but most of all the 
steadfastness of purpose displayed by "Wash- 
ington brought success to the American cause. 
Professor Becker's narrative thus differs in 
several essentials from the version usually 
accepted. 

The second volume of the set, "Union and 
Democracy," by Professor Johnson, covers the 
period from 1783 to 1828. The writer treats 
first the commercial, financial, and political 
troubles of that unfortunate experiment in 
government, the Confederation. The forma- 
tion of the Constitution, the organization of 
the new national government, and the steps 
by which this government sought to establish 
its authority over the states, are portrayed in 
the orthodox way. The period is interesting 
and complex; and although the term "criti- 
cal period" is pretty generally applied to 
that of the Confederation, the years imme- 
diately following the adoption of the Consti- 
tution may also lay claim to an importance 
scarcely less great. Particularism was strong, 
respect for the national government was slow 
of growth; party loyalty and factional ani- 
mosity often obscured the goal toward which 
the nation moved. The constant and strenu- 
ous effort to establish itself as a nation, to 
protect its subjects, to maintain its rights, 
and at the same time to avoid being drawn 
into the general European war which was 



raging, laid heavy burdens upon those who 
guided the destinies of the new American 
State. The unrest of these years was in- 
creased by the fact that the parties, divided 
as they were over the interpretation of the 
Constitution as to the relative powers of the 
states and the national government, were also 
clearly in opposition as to the attitude which 
America should assume toward the warring 
powers. 

Still another line of development the 
occupation of the West served to compli- 
cate the situation. Professor Johnson points 
out that the " greatest obstacle in the path of 
the people of the United States in their strug- 
gle towards national life was the vastness of 
the territory which they occupied." The 
occupation of the trans-Alleghany country 
was one of the tremendous movements of 
the period. This was accomplished in the 
face of the most serious opposition, not only 
upon the part of the Indians, but of the 
European nations as well, since each of these 
hoped by diplomatic intrigues among them- 
selves, with the Indians, and with the settlers 
in the West, to establish themselves in the 
Mississippi Valley, and thereby rob the 
American people of the fruits of the late war. 
This diplomatic contest for the possession of 
the West is one of the most fascinating and 
complex studies in our history. 

With the occupation of the West, which 
was accomplished with astonishing rapidity 
by the pioneers, a distinctly sectional feeling 
developed. The antagonism of the back- 
country farmer of colonial Virginia toward 
the planter of the tide- water country 
which in itself was really class antagonism 
based upon differences in wealth, social posi- 
tion, and political importance appeared 
again in the opposition of the young, provin- 
cial, trans-Alleghany West to the older and 
more conservative East. 

The West came into political power in 
1811. Urged on by the hatred borne by the 
western men for the English, whom they 
held responsible for most of the Indian trou- 
bles along the frontier, it carried the nation 
into the second war with England. As far 
as land operations were concerned, this war 
had little in it to which the American could 
"point with pride." One lesson was not lost 
on Madison, who, in a special message to Con- 
gress in 1815, wrote : 

" Experience has taught us that neither the paci- 
fic dispositions of the American people nor the 
pacific character of their political institutions, can 
altogether exempt them from that strife which 
appears, beyond the ordinary lot of nations, to be 
incident to the actual period of the world; and 
the same faithful monitor demonstrates that a cer- 



370 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 28 



tain degree of preparation for war is not only 
indispensable to avert disaster in the onset, but 
affords also the best security for the continuance 
of peace." 

The influence of the war was beneficial, 
however. The nation was released from its 
close dependence upon Europe, and a favor- 
able peace laid the foundations for the settle- 
ment of our differences with Great Britain. 
There developed, also, a national conscious- 
ness which drew attention to such internal 
problems as the tariff, the bank, internal 
improvements, and the extension of slavery. 
During these years, too, came several of the 
remarkable decisions of Chief Justice Mar- 
shall, by which the doctrine of Federal 
supremacy over the states was first given 
definite legal form. 

The triumph of American democracy came 
with the election of Jackson. The period 
from Jackson to Lincoln, during which the 
nation wrestled with the most important 
problems it had been called upon so far to 
solve, has always been one of deep interest. 
The volume covering this period of " Expan- 
sion and Conflict" has the additional attrac- 
tion of being written by a Southerner. Pro- 
fessor Dodd works upon the assumption that, 
except in extent of territory which they occu- 
pied, the American people did not form a 
nation until after the close of the Civil War. 
The assumption seems well founded, since sec- 
tional interests undoubtedly were uppermost 
in the thoughts of all save a few of the most 
broad-minded leaders. 

In this unsettled period the sectional feel- 
ing which had existed between the Atlantic 
states and those beyond the Alleghanies was 
submerged in a sectionalism much more vio- 
lent in character, which was determined along 
lines of latitude instead of longitude. The 
North was a land of towns and small farms ; 
the South a land of plantations, where the 
problem from the very beginning of the plan- 
tation system had been that of labor. 
Through the introduction of negro slavery, a 
solution had been reached at an early date. 
As long as the slave communities had been 
confined to the Atlantic Plain, the question 
of the extension of slavery had not been 
one of great political significance. With the 
expansion of the slave power, coming after 
the War of 1812 as the result of the rapid 
increase in the production of cotton and 
tobacco, the opponents of the institution be- 
came alarmed, and the question grew rapidly 
in importance until it came to over-shadow 
and finally to obscure all others. Very natu- 
rally the Southern leaders felt that the eco- 
nomic life of the South was dependent 



largely upon slavery. They could see, too, 
that sooner or later the rapidly growing 
North was to outstrip the South in the race 
for political supremacy, and consequently it 
was but a question of time until the several 
branches of the national government would 
fall into the hands of those hostile to negro 
servitude. This could mean only one thing: 
slavery would be declared illegal, and the 
economic structure of the South would be 
ruined. 

Southern leaders saw two possible ways 
through which the situation might be con- 
trolled. In the first place, the doctrine of 
strict construction of the Constitution must 
be rigidly adhered to, and developed still 
further. This was done most skilfully by the 
powerful mind, of Calhoun ; and out of the 
older doctrine grew the States Rights doc- 
trine, under which slavery in the common- 
wealths seemed safe. In the second place, the 
South must keep her representation in the 
Senate equal to that of the North, which was 
certain to gain control of the House of Repre- 
sentatives. This could be accomplished by the 
extension of slavery into the territories, in the 
hope that when new commonwealths came to 
seek admission to the Union they would come 
with constitutions legalizing slavery. The 
vigorous opposition of the North to this pol- 
icy led the sections into a series of violent 
controversies which could not be disposed of 
by compromises. The fact that the territory 
left open by the Missouri Compromise to the 
peaceful extension of slavery was decidedly 
limited in extent undoubtedly influenced the 
nation's policy of expansion which prevailed 
in the forties. 

This storm and stress period, when the 
South fought hard for the extension of its 
power and the protection of its economic and 
social organization, Professor Dodd treats 
from the standpoint of the historian, not the 
partisan. In addition to a clear sketch of 
the political events of the time, he has found 
space to give us a glimpse of the economic 
and social background so necessary to the 
proper interpretation of these years of un- 
rest. The great personalities under whose 
leadership the sentiment of either section 
crystallized are briefly characterized, the 
greater emphasis being laid, very properly, 
upon the influence each exerted in moulding 
the political thought of the time. The chap- 
ters on "The Militant South," "The Aboli- 
tionists" and "American Culture" will attract 
attention, as will those on the war itself. 

The period from the close of the Civil War 
to the present time, which Professor Paxson 
covers in " The New Nation," is, from the 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



371 



standpoint of the average college student at 
least, the " Dark Ages " of American history. 
Still it is a period of very decided interest. 
During the years of Reconstruction, states- 
men and politicians alike wrestled with the 
problem of the status of the seceded common- 
wealths. An undignified struggle went on be- 
tween the legislative and executive branches 
of the government, neither party being cer- 
tain of its constitutional ground in the mat- 
ter. In the meantime the South suffered 
under the rule of the carpet-bagger, which 
ruined what remained of its civilization, 
wasted its scanty resources, fastened upon it 
the rule of an inferior race, and delayed for 
years the efforts of the planter to rebuild his 
wrecked economic system. In the end, it was 
the mysterious Ku Klux Klan and the 
Knights of the White Camellia, whose ghostly 
riders struck terror into the hearts of the 
dusky politicians and rid the South of the 
hated political adventurers. 

During the quarter century after the war 
the trans-Missouri West was occupied. These 
are the times of the cattlemen of the Great 
Plains ; of the miners of the Black Hills and 
Colorado ; of Red Cloud, Black Kettle, Crazy 
Horse, and Chief Joseph; of Custer, Fetter- 
man, and Crook. Whoever loves the romance 
of the frontier will find something here to 
interest him. During these years the trans- 
continental railroads bridged the American 
Desert, brought about the disappearance of 
the frontier, and relegated the picturesque 
cowboy to the pages of fiction. 

Our foreign relations during the period 
are also of much importance. For years after 
the close of the war there was a decided ten- 
dency toward expansion, as is evidenced by 
the purchase of Alaska and the attempts to 
obtain the Danish West Indies and San 
Domingo. The settlement of the Alabama 
Claims, the Venezuelan question, and our 
several boundary controversies indicate the 
beginning of an era of cordial relations with 
the other great English-speaking people. Our 
relations with Spain grew more and more 
strained through these years, until at last we 
became involved in a war with that nation 
and emerged from it a world power. Pro- 
fessor Paxson's treatment of this event is 
certain to attract attention, since it differs 
radically from the popular accounts usually 
accepted. To him it appears that Spain was 
not entirely to blame for the situation which 
developed; that the Spanish nation made 
nearly every concession which could reason- 
ably be expected of it; and finally that the 
"yellow" newspapers forced America into a 
struggle which diplomacy might have averted. 



Probably the most interesting part of the 
volume is that dealing with the economic, 
social, and political reorganization of the na- 
tion which shows itself in the widespread 
unrest of recent years. New parties have 
been formed to protest against the reaction- 
ary tendencies of the older political organiza- 
tions, and are demanding radical changes in 
the administrative system. A conflict is in 
progress to compel "big business" to con- 
form to the laws of the land. The restraining 
influence which the judiciary has exercised 
over state legislatures in their battles with 
the railroads has brought this branch of our 
government under closer scrutiny than ever 
before. There is an undoubted sentiment 
against the so-called legislation by the judi- 
ciary. Labor has organized to protect itself, 
and is making earnest demands for social and 
economic justice; the Far West is insisting 
that its interests be given consideration; the 
representatives of various powerful indus- 
tries are urging the national legislature to 
frame tariff bills consistent with the desires 
of each. The people have awakened to the 
value of the nation's natural resources, and 
earnestly oppose that school of capitalists 
which supports the doctrine " that all natural 
resources of the country should be trans- 
ferred to private hands as speedily as possi- 
ble, at a nominal charge, or no charge at all." 

Many thousands of government documents, 
monographs, and editorials have appeared 
treating these questions from every conceiv- 
able point of view, and each colored by the 
sympathies of the writer. By gathering the 
facts which are important, and presenting 
them in an orderly way, together with inter- 
pretations which are clear cut and consistent 
with the principles of sound scholarship. 
Professor Paxson has made a contribution 
which will be appreciated by those who 
attempt to grasp the significant things in the 
development of this exceedingly interesting 
period. 

The "Riverside History" is a good one, 
but it will be found more serviceable to the 
reader who has some groundwork in the sub- 
ject than to him who has none. The treat- 
ment of the social and intellectual phases, 
although brief, is worth while. In some 
cases, however, it may call forth comments 
which are not entirely sympathetic. An 
abundance of really good maps will be an 
invaluable aid to the reader, as will also be 
the short bibliographies found at the close of 
the several chapters. As a piece of book- 
making the series could scarcely be improved 
upon.

DANTE IN A NEW TRANSLATION.* 



A new translation of an old classic must 
expect the keenest criticism, unless it be put 
forth under private imprint and confessedly 
as solace or pastime of the translator. Such, 
however, is not the case with Professor John- 
son's rendering of " The Divine Comedy." 
Emanating from one university and endorsed 
by another, it challenges comparison with the 
already existing translations, and should show 
superiority to most or all of its predecessors. 
This new translator aims especially at "mod- 
ern English," at " rhythmical qualities pleas- 
ing to the English ear," while holding to a 
line-for-line version and giving consideration 
to Dante's words even so far as their place in 
the sentence. At the same time, he stands for 
the claim and obligation of the translation to 
be " a work of art." Yet he alters the femi- 
nine endings of the original to masculine, 
thus, in the absence of rhyme, giving blank 
verse. 

It will be seen that the translator begins 
with certain inconsistencies in his programme. 
A reverence for the original which insists on 
retaining words in their place in the sentence 
is hardly reconciled with the license to alter 
the rhyme-plan and the metre of the master. 
Nor has the former adherence to the original 
as good grounds as could be urged for a close 
following of .the verse form. In fact, it has 
very poor grounds, and is altogether imprac- 
ticable as a working rule. Professor Johnson 
must have forgotten it before he proceeded 
very far, for the lines in which the rule is 
violated are more numerous than those in 
which it is followed. 

The best that may be said of this new ver- 
sion is that it contains not infrequent pas- 
sages combining great dignity and great 
simplicity. The following, from Paradise 
II., may serve as an example of the best : 

" ye, who in a very little bark, 

Eager to listen, have been following 
Behind my ship that singing makes its way, 

Turn back to look again upon your shores; 
Put you not out to sea, lest it befall 
That, losing me, ye should remain astray. 

The water which I take was never sailed ; 
Minerva breathes, Apollo is my guide, 
And Muses nine point out to me the Bears." 

Or this, from Canto IX. of the Purgatory : 
" It was the hour before the dawn, when first 
The swallow sings her melancholy lays, 
Perchance in memory of former woes, 
And when our mind is more a wanderer 

From flesh, and less held captive to our thought, 
And in its visions is almost divine." 

* THE DIVINE COMEDY. Translated by Henry Johnson.

One could find many passages of from five to 
ten lines each in which the style is as straight- 
forward and the rhythm as good. But one 
should not have to seek for them; they are 
what one has a right to expect. 

Unfortunately, the challenges of the under- 
taking seem to be rather recklessly met, and the 
promises of the preface are not kept. Clarity 
and simplicity are often far from our path 
in this version. Vocabulary and idiom are not 
always modern. Obscurity and awkwardness 
mar many passages. Worst of all, the versi- 
fication is painfully imperfect, a constant 
stumbling-block to distract attention from 
form and thought. Rhythm and clarity suffer 
alike in such a rendering as this (Inferno, 
I, 8-9) : 

" But yet, to treat of the good that I found there, 
I speak of other things that there I found." 

It is not sufficient to urge that the original 
is sometimes obscure. The translator should 
see clearly and make clear, especially when 
he abstains from any and all notes. So in 
Paradise I., 76-77 : 

" When the revolving, which Thou longed-for 

makest 
Eternal, drew my thought into itself." 

These are merely examples of numerous sim- 
ilar passages which might be cited. 

Not obscurity but mere awkwardness of 
expression is the fault with the following 
(Inferno IV., 1) : 

" The deep sleep in my head was broken off 
By heavy thundering." 

We understand at the end of the sentence 
that thunder roused him from sleep. But 
certainly the first image from the chief ex- 
pression is of a sharp instrument "broken 
off " in the man's head. 

A long list of constructions which are 
neither "modern English" nor manifesta- 
tions of "the strength and beauty of our own 
language" could be cited; but the following 
may serve as typical : 
" Like one who listens to some great deceit 

That has been done him, and resents it sore," 

Inferno VIII., 22-23. 
" San Leo can be reached . . . 

With only feet, but here one needs to fly," 

Purg. IV., 27. 
" Moving his look only along his thigh," 

Purg. IV, 113. 

" But the deep wounds from which 
Came forth the blood, in which I had my seat," 

Purg. V, 73-4. 
(No, reader, he was not sitting in a pool of 



" S ,u,s 
Who for the valley were not seen without," 

Purg. VII., 84. 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



373 



" They both from Mary's bosom have come down," 

Purg. VIII., 37, 
" No salutation fair from each to each 

was silent," Purg. VIII., 56, 

(Meaning, "was lacking.") 

" So much of wax 
As to the enameled summit is required " 

Purg. VIII., 114. 
" I craved the mercy of his opening," 

Purg. IX., 110, 
(Meaning, "I begged him to open it.") 

The fact that Longfellow used several of 
these too literal and awkward translations will 
scarcely make them more acceptable in a later 
work. 

In addition to the stiffness of style, there is 
a considerable archaic vocabulary, puzzling 
to the modern reader. The rendering "St. 
Lawrence " for " San Lorenzo " takes us quite 
unnecessarily far from Italy. Is it good 
English to speak of an " Empress over many 
languages" when "races" is meant? Is it 
permissible to locate "mosques" in the city 
of Dis? Consider in the following the sense 
of "thrust" and "gall" (Parad. IV., 27-29) : 
" These are the questions that upon thy will 
Thrust equally, and therefore I will first 
Treat of the one that has the more of gall." 
Or of "seat" in this (Parad. III., 82) : 
" So that as we exist from seat to seat 

Throughout this realm." 
Or of this expression (Parad. II., 77) : 

"As a body 
Divides the fat and lean." 

A curious judgment has led to the transla- 
tion, in a supplement, of all the Latin phrases 
in the* text, such as suo loco, in exitu Israel de 
Egypto, miserere, Te Deum laudamus, Agnus 
Dei, etc. Since all other annotations are dis- 
pensed with, it would seem as though the 
reader of "The Divine Comedy" could be 
trusted to cope with such small Latin, almost 
all of it being familiar in the Bible and tlje 
church service. 

If it was hoped that this translation was to 
be read for pleasure, alone or in comparison 
with any of the older versions, the necessary 
pains should not have been spared to make it 
scan better, to attain "the rhythmical quali- 
ties pleasing to the English ear." It is not 
merely an occasional line which gives offence, 
where the excuse might be that fidelity to the 
text and the line-for-line rendering seemed in- 
compatible with pleasing rhythm. There are 
hundreds of lines in which an agreeable move- 
ment is attainable by the simple transposition 
of a word or a phrase, giving in most cases a 
better poetic construction. A few of these 
will suffice to demonstrate the validity of the 



criticism. " I pray, bring me to the memory 
of men," Inf. VI., 89, (Bring me, I pray thee, 
to men's memory) ; " Of wishing to speak 
with them secretly," Inf. VIII., 87, (Of wish- 
ing secretly to speak with them) ; " That he 
would tell me who might be with him," Inf. 
X., 117, (That he would tell me who with him 
might be) . 

It is a curious fact that a large number of 
the bad scansions have evidently been justi- 
fied by an unwarranted stress on a pronoun. 
But the most irritating cases are those of 
which the following is an example (Purg. 
VII., 7) : "I am Virgil ; and for no other sin," 
where the simple transposition, "Virgil am 
I," gives good scansion and a stronger line. 

The line, "My ancestors made me so arro- 
gant" (Purg. XI., 62), is doubly defective. 
It can be scanned only by stressing "me"; 
and the sense is obscured by the idiom. " My 
ancestry begot in me such pride" deviates 
from the phrasing of the original, but it obvi- 
ates both defects. Yet since the translation 
deviates from the original anyway, one should 
at least save rhythm and sense. " The rays 
were striking us full in the face," which gal- 
lops instead of stalks, is easily made into a 
good iambic line by inversion, " Full in the 
face the rays were striking us." So also with 
" I asked that I might give strength to thy 
feet," " I went along through air bitter and 
foul," "Me to Parnassus to drink in its caves," 
"As it was possible when it lost her," " Thou 
shalt see me come to thy chosen tree," and 
scores of other lines, which limp or refuse 
utterly to go ; with the aid of a simple inver- 
sion they march properly enough. The very 
small number of six-stressed lines would be 
overlooked much more readily than these 
rough ones. 

It is a disappointment to find the product 
of so much labor unsatisfactory, and it is 
painful to give an unfavorable judgment on 
the serious work of an earnest man. One 
function Professor Johnson's translation may 
fairly serve, that of pacing-mate to the Ital- 
ian text, for one who needs assistance.

THE FASCINATION OF JAPANESE PRINTS.* 



The sense of detachment necessary to the 
formation of an impartial estimate of the 
worth of a book is made difficult when the 
book is dedicated to the reviewer, and various 
complimentary references to him are scat- 
tered through its pages. It is with a keen

realization of this disability that the present 
reviewer ventures to tell the readers of THE 
DIAL, what he thinks of Mr. Ficke's " Chats 
on Japanese Prints," and he craves their 
indulgence should what he have to say seem 
lacking in critical judgment. There is the 
more need to ask this because the book is of 
such conspicuous merit as to call for generous 
praise. 

In the forty years or thereabout since the 
color prints by the Ukiyoe masters first came 
to the attention of art lovers in Europe and 
America, the circle of their ardent admirers 
has steadily widened, and without doubt 
would be far wider still were there more 
abundant opportunities for seeing prints of 
the better class. From the beginning these 
prints have gone into the portfolios of eager 
collectors, who were quick to feel their charm 
and to appreciate their artistic worth, but 
who have been loath to lend them for exhibi- 
tion or even to hang them upon their own 
walls, for they soon learned that extended 
exposure to light was at the risk of virtual 
destruction through the fading of the lovely 
reds and yellows printed in fugitive tints. 
As for the most precious prints of all, the 
supreme impressions in perfect preservation 
of the most distinguished designs by the 
greatest artists of the school, they are so rare 
that the number of their possessors at any 
time can never be more than a very few. 

Although the collector's prizes are so scarce 
as to make the search for them an exciting 
pursuit, with the hope ever present to give 
it zest that some wonderful hidden stores 
may yet be discovered, the number of prints 
of a little less distinction, but still of great 
beauty, is very large, and these have found 
their way into many hands. And while op- 
portunities for seeing the finer prints have 
been restricted, they have not been altogether 
lacking. Some very good prints have been 
acquired by museums and public libraries in 
Europe and America, where they are accessi- 
ble to all who apply; important exhibitions 
have been held in Paris, London, New York, 
and Chicago, and smaller ones an other cities ; 
and everywhere collectors have been gener- 
ous in showing their treasures privately. 

"With increasing interest has come desire 
for information. This the books hitherto 
available very imperfectly supply. The need 
has been for a compact and readable work, 
which, while giving the historical facts so far 
as they are known, should emphasize the 
aesthetic charm of the prints and make clear 
the soundness of the conception upon which 
it rests. Such a book Mr. Ficke has now 
given us. It opens with a " Preliminary Sur- 



vey " in which the claims of Far Eastern art 
are admirably presented. Then the incep- 
tion, development, and decay of the Ukiyoe 
School are passed in review, all of the more 
important artists being taken up in turn and 
the strong and weak points in their works put 
before the reader in nicely discriminating 
phrase. Throughout, the aim is to set forth 
the distinctive qualities that to the discerning 
mind make the prints " a unique source of 
repose and exaltation." A few sentences from 
the introductory chapter will show how vividly 
the right point of view is put forward : 

" That sublimated pleasure which is the seal of 
all the arts reaches its purest condition when 
evoked by a work in which the aesthetic quality is 
not too closely mingled with the everyday human. 
. . All Asian art has recognized for centuries the 
fact that vision and imagination are the faculties 
by which the painter as well as the poet must 
grapple with reality. . . Its function is the func- 
tion which the European public grants to poets 
but not always to painters the seeking out of 
subtle and invisible relations in things, the percep- 
tion of harmonies and rhythms not heard by the 
common ear, the interpretation of life in terms of 
a finer and more beautiful order than practical 
life has ever known." 

These considerations are reiterated and 
specifically applied in dealing with the sev- 
eral artists upon whose works Mr. Ficke 
pleasantly discourses. His pages are packed 
with information for the student and the col- 
lector, but so deftly is it worked in that the 
reader may easily fail at first to realize its 
extent. There are a few mistakes, but all of 
them relate to matters of minor importance. 
Still, as even little things are of interest to 
students, it may not be amiss to point out 
those that seem to invite comment. 

In the opening chapter the assertion is 
made that "the linear perspective of the 
Japanese exactly reverses that of Western 
painting," and that " in their system, par- 
allel lines converge as they approach the 
spectator." Isometric projection, which the 
Japanese artists employed until the elements 
of linear perspective were learned from the 
Dutch at Nagasaki, cannot be called " Japa- 
nese perspective," and when it is used par- 
allel lines do not actually but only apparently 
converge as they approach the spectator. 

The Hanekawa Chiucho Motonobu men- 
tioned on page 105 is identical with Hane- 
kawa Chincho named on page 91, and it is 
not known that he was a pupil of Okumura 
Masanobu, nor is it likely, for he appears to 
have been the elder man by some ten or 
eleven years. 

Whether the artist who, unless it should be 
determined that Torii Kiyonobu did not die 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



375 



in 1729, must be regarded as the second 
Kiyonobu, produced any hand-colored prints 
is not "uncertain," as Mr. Ficke asserts on ; 
page 88. Two pages farther on he says it is j 
" fairly established " that he did. The fact is ! 
that there are in existence several hand- 
colored prints signed Torii Kiyonobu which ! 
can be definitely ascribed to the year 1742. 

The blue of Koryusai's " own devising," 
mentioned on page 163, was used before his ! 
day by Harunobu, Kiyomitsu. and Toyonobu. i 
And Shuncho was so far from having " only ; 
one manner except in a few early actor j 
prints," that, after the passing of Kiyonaga's 
style, he designed prints in that of Eishi, 
Utamaro, and even Sharaku ; and early in his 
career he made a few that closely imitate the 
style of Shigemasa. 

Such errors as " the Kikunojo clan " 
(p. 135) in place of the Segawa line; or 
specifying Nakamura Matsuye when Naka- 
mura Tomijuro is depicted (plate 20) ; or of 
naming one of Kiyonaga's masterpieces rep- 
resenting a party of merrymakers in a room 
open upon one side, " The Terrace by the 
Sea," when no terrace is shown, are of little 
consequence. 

More serious is the spelling of certain j 
Japanese names in a way that will not stand 
critical examination. That one should be 
confused by such divergent forms as Ukioye, 
Ukiyoye, and Ukiyoe is not surprising. For 
the first form, however, there is no warrant 
save that it has obtained currency among 
English writers. The word is made up of 
the three syllables Uki (floating) yo (world) 
e (picture). It is possible to use the syllable 
ye, which also signifies a picture; but as the 
y is silent, the other syllable is preferable 
and is the one that is used by the Japanese. 
In transliterating Japanese words there is 
seldom any occasion for the use of ye. It 
represents a sound heard only in the middle 
of words where, as in " Shunyei " for ex- 
ample, the sound of the preceding syllable 
forces it. It is not heard in such names as 
Eishi. Eiri, Edo, and the like; and the forms 
Yeishi, Yeiri, and Yedo therefore invite mis- 
pronunciation. So also does the spelling 
''Koriusai," though in lesser degree. In the 
accepted system of phonetic transliteration i 
has the sound of ee in " meet." To represent 
correctly the name of the artist just men- 
tioned we must spell it Koryusai. The r is 
slightly rolled, the y sounded full, and the u 
prolonged. The word is made up of the syl- 
lables Ko (lake) ryu (dragon) sai (studio). 

Mr. Ficke's estimates of the work of the 
several artists are singularly just. His clear- 
sighted appreciation of the qualities in these 



works that commend them so strongly to peo- 
ple of taste, and his felicitous portrayal of 
their fascination, are the things that give his 
book its value. With very few of his asser- 
tions respecting the leading artists is it pos- 
sible to quarrel. Of Harunobu he truly says 
that " his real theme was the great harmonies 
of colour and line." But when he claims that 
"every print signed Harunobu is suspect," 
until we know whether Shiba Kokan, the con- 
fessed forger of a few prints signed Haru- 
nobu, was "the greatest liar or the greatest 
forger in history," he does grievous injury to 
the reputation of a great artist. The truth 
is that none of Harunobu's important works 
can be suspect. Kokan was far from being 
his equal. He had some ability, and a few 
clever forgeries put forth immediately after 
Harunobu's death were not inferior to some 
of the master's pot-boilers. But the number 
of his forgeries that are easily recognizable 
by their mannerisms makes it fairly certain 
that all or nearly all of them must similarly 
betray their origin. That Koryusai also may 
have forged Harunobu's signature is a state- 
ment with which the reviewer cannot agree. 
He has never seen a scintilla of evidence to 
support the supposition. 

Aside from this failure to realize the un- 
approachable charm and the strength of 
Harunobu's designs, Mr. Ficke's remarks 
about the several artists are all that could be 
desired. Take, for example, his chat about 
Sharaku. How could the significance of his 
work be better expressed than in the words 
of the opening paragraph? 

" Few people approach Sharaku's work for the 
first time without regarding him as a repulsive 
charlatan, the creator of perversely and sense- 
lessly ugly portraits whose cross-eyes, impossible 
mouths, and snaky gestures have not the slightest 
claim to be called art. At first these strange pic- 
tures may even seem mirth-provoking to the spec- 
tator a view of them which he will remember 
in later years with almost incredulous wonder. 
To overcome one's original feeling of repulsion 
may take a long time; but to every serious stu- 
dent of Japanese prints there comes at last a day 
when he sees these portraits with different eyes; 
and suddenly the consciousness is born in him that 
Sharaku stands on the highest level of genius, in 
a greatness unique, sublime, and appalling." 

The final chapter of the book is addressed 
to the collector, and is full of practical wis- 
dom. The author was perhaps ill-advised in 
giving instructions for washing prints, since 
it may lead people to attempt it with disas- 
trous results. And when mentioning the 
possibility of certain stains being removed 
mechanically it would have been well to add 
that the knife should be used only on un-

printed parts of the paper. The other sug- 
gestions as to the care of prints, and the 
advice about what to look for and what to 
avoid when buying, are very much to the 
point. A unique and delightful feature of 
the book is found in the poems that serve to 
introduce many of the artists to the reader. 
The volume is well printed, and is illustrated 
with half-tone reproductions of a considera- 
ble number of prints. To say that it is a 
distinct contribution to the literature of the 
subject is not enough: it is easily the best 
book about Japanese prints that has yet been 
written. FREDERICK W. GOOKIN. 



PROFtnsrms.* 



Remembering the tendency to sluggishness 
that at all times besets the human imagina- 
tion, and our proneness 
" In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined 

On the hills like Gods together, careless of 
mankind," 

it is perhaps well for us that by a blast as 
from some subterranean trumpet, we should 
be reminded of the under-world of tragedy 
and suffering from which we are separated 
by the thinnest of partitions. The time seems 
peculiarly appropriate for just such a call to 
serious thinking as Mr. Sinclair's anthology, 
" The Cry for Justice." The collective con- 
science of the world, with its accompanying 
sense of responsibility for the woes of human- 
ity, is awakening in these latter days to an 
extent that constitutes this a new age. But 
like all awakening sleepers, the world resents 
the intrusion of troublesome realities and the 
disturbance of pleasant dreams, and is fain 
to turn on the other side and sink once more 
into slumber. It is this proclivity to somno- 
lence that must justify the bringing together 
of these vivid pictures of human misery 
selected from the entire range of the world 
of literature. That the volume will serve a 
useful purpose in arousing many from the 
ignoble repose which life offers to even a 
moderate degree of affluence, when combined 
with a sensitiveness to the joys of the intellect 
and the things of the spirit, we cannot doubt. 
" The Cry for Justice " must be considered 
as being specially addressed to those middle- 
class people who are the chief creators of 
public opinion, who owe little of their enjoy- 
ment of life to the leverage of special privi- 
lege, and who are not too removed from 
the menace of poverty to be alive to the

of Social Protest. Edited by Upton Sinclair; with Introduc- 
tion by Jack London. Illustrated. Philadelphia: John C.

appeal for social justice. That the anthology 
is as forceful and convincing as it might have 
been we cannot concede. When one remem- 
bers the immense field over which the mate- 
rial for such a compendium is scattered, one 
hesitates to suggest that the book might well 
have been condensed or boiled down. Every 
writer and editor knows, however, as every 
horticulturalist knows, the wisdom of ruthless 
pruning, and we fancy the readers of this 
book will agree with us in thinking that much 
which is included might with advantage have 
been omitted. Passages from Talleyrand, 
Lafcadio Hearn, Nietzsche, the German Em- 
peror, and others that could be named, seem 
to have little bearing on the main purpose of 
the book, and only weaken its appeal. We 
should have liked to see greater use made of 
the writings of the later prophets of Israel. 
The cry for justice has never gone up to 
Heaven in more impressive language than 
was constantly used by Habakkuk, Hosea, 
Malachi, and Amos; and the condemnation 
of the economic structure of Society which 
prevails to this day was never more convinc- 
ingly expressed than in the words, "Behold, 
it is not of the Lord of Hosts that the people 
should labour as in the fire, or weary them- 
selves for very vanity." 

While admitting that the production of this 
anthology is fully justified by the tragic con- 
ditions under which human life is being 
passed upon this planet, by the seething 
restlessness and discontent on the part of 
those who have to bear the heavy burdens of 
life while debarred from participation in its 
higher joys, and by the stupid misunder- 
standing of the signs of the times on the part 
of the governing classes, a critic's function 
would not be discharged if he failed to point 
out that, as inevitably happens in such cases, 
the picture presented is composed entirely of 
shadows, and the lights (not to speak of high 
lights) are completely omitted. The conse- 
quence is that the feeling of atmosphere and 
perspective is lost, and the impression left 
upon the mind of the' reader is not entirely 
true to fact. There is, for instance, little in 
the book to remind us that misery is not dis- 
tributed in inverse ratio to affluence, nor 
happiness directly in proportion to wealth. 
There is no suggestion of "the soothing 
thoughts that spring out of human suffering." 
There is little hint of the gleams of joy that 
gild the horizon of the most wretched, or of 
the abject joylessness that attends life in 
many a luxurious drawing-room. The editor 
quotes an impressive passage from Carlyle, 

" It is not because of his toils that I lament for 
the poor; we must all toil, or steal (howsoever we 



1915] 



THE DIAL

name our stealing), which is worse. The poor is 
hungry and athirst, but for him also there is food 
and drink; he is heavy-laden and weary, but for 
him also Heaven sends sleep and of the deepest; 
in his smoky cribs a clear dewy heaven of rest 
envelops him, and fitful glimmerings of cloud- 
skirted dreams. But what I do mourn over is that 
the lamp of his 1 soul should go out; that no ray 
of Heavenly or even of earthly knowledge should 
visit him." 

But none knew better than Carlyle that the 
lamp of the soul is extinguished by wealth 
more readily than by poverty and oppression, 
and that the spiritual plight of the slave- 
owner or the irresponsible capitalist is fre- 
quently worse than that of the slave. Indeed, 
it may reasonably be maintained that the 
capacity for joy in the human soul expires 
more rapidly in the asphyxiating atmosphere 
of riches than in the social stratum where a 
struggle for the bread that perishes is the 
rule of daily life. That it is easier for a 
camel to go through the eye of a needle than 
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of 
Heaven, is not merely a poetic metaphor but 
a statement of fact which many millionaires 
are bitterly aware of; while those who are 
best acquainted with the life of the poor 
know well that it is difficult to find a human 
being so destitute as to have entirely lost the 
capacity for joy, or the power of reacting to 
the stimuli of starlit nights and the beauty 
of the sunrise. 

We should be exceedingly unwilling to 
appear as though acting the part of apologist 
for things as they are. Our only concern is 
that we should see life as it is, and in its true 
proportions and perspective; and if the 
reader of "The Cry for Justice" can be 
trusted to bear in mind that the picture is 
inevitably out of drawing and lacking in the 
elements that constitute truth in art, the les- 
son that the book teaches of the dire necessity 
to save civilization by a study of the eco- 
nomics of industry, will be well learned. But 
after having steeped himself, possibly to the 
point of despair, in the atmosphere of misery 
which the book presents, we recommend the 
reader to seek a quiet corner in which to 
study carefully Burns's " Jolly Beggars " by 
way of a spiritual counterpoise. There he 
will find all that is lacking in the doleful pic- 
tures of life presented in the book he has just 
read. The joy in human companionship ; the 
delight in that irresponsibility that only those 
know who have nothing to lose; the trustful 
instinct which feels no anxiety for the future 
and tastes with gratitude the cup of joy as it 
passes, without a misgiving as to what may 
come next; the sane and rational attitude 
toward life that is unknown to most men of 



wealth and which expresses itself in the lines, 
" The present moment is our own, the next 
we never saw": all these side-lights on the 
life of the poor he will find in that great mas- 
terpiece, and will be compelled to admit that 
it bears the stamp of truth which only a great 
artist can give to a picture.

The idea of translating Gerhard Haupt- 
mann's " Parsival " was indeed a good one, 
but in Mr. Oakley "Williams's rendering the 
spirit of the original has been grossly mis- 
interpreted. Hauptmann's work was written 
as a child's book, for his twelve-year-old son, 
and published with spirited pictures. Disre- 
garding this fact, the translator has sought 
to make it into a sententious " allegory of 
life." The book jacket advertises the transla- 
tion as " retaining to a remarkable degree the 
beauty and simplicity of the original." One 
who has really read Hauptmann's exquisite 
German will feel that the kind of alliterative 
prose in which the translator has rendered it 
is little more than a mockery. 

The legend of the Grail was one which 
entered German literature early in the thir- 
teenth century, with "Wolfram von Eschen- 
bach's "Parsival." To him is due the trans- 
formation of the fantastic story of the Grail 
into a legend filled with deepest human signifi- 
cance, the principal characteristics of which 
have endured and reappeared in modern ver- 
sions. Wolfram divested the legend of the 
churchly character which his French prede- 
cessor had endeavored to give it, and made 
the Grail a centre of extra-ecclesiastical wor- 
ship, guarded in a castle accessible only to the 
truthful and pure of heart. The Grail that 
hovered before the poet's eyes was rather an 
Aladdin's lamp than a body relic. In the 
centuries after Wolfram, the meaning of the 
Grail fell rapidly to a significance purely sen- 
sual; its castle became an earthly paradise. 
Neither the printing of Wolfram's poem in 
1477 nor Bodmer's attempted revival in 1753- 
81 bore fruit. The literary renaissance of the 
legend, stimulated by new editions of the 
poem and by histories of mediaeval literature, 
began with Immermann's "Merlin," 1830-32, 
and culminated in Wagner's "Parsival." 
These two were not dramatizations of the 
mediaeval epic, but rather new creations de-

pendent upon the ancient sources for only a 
few motifs. 

In his work Hauptmann has reverted for 
the main outlines of the story to the version 
of Wolfram, but has restored to the legend 
much of the lofty religious atmosphere and 
significance which it had lost. Parsival, who | 
has lived alone with his mother Heartache, 
unconscious of the existence of other human j 
beings, forsakes her to battle against the 
world. After slaying the Proud Knight of 
the Heath to avenge a maiden, he turns back 
only to find that Heartache and the hut where 
she lived have disappeared. Parsival sets out 
to find her and to kill the man from whose 
wrong she suffered. In his wanderings he 
comes upon the Grail, but forsakes it because 
he does not know its meaning. When he 
guesses what it may be he is never again able 
to find it. Intent on the search, he forsakes 
his young wife Blanchefleur. and casts away 
an earthly., kingdom. When he returns, after 
years of fruitless search, it is only to find 
that his wife has just died. His son Lohen- 
grin does not recognize him. nor does anyone 
except the old Arab from whom he had 
learned that the Grail was a miraculous sym- 
bol of Christ's passion, and that Amfortas, its 
keeper, was his own father. Parsival then 
becomes a serving man. a bearer of burdens 
in the cities and a serf in the country. He 
comes to realize that Heartache is but a sym- 
bol for the sorrows of the whole world. 
Finally, when he feels that his search is near 
an end, the aged messenger of the Grail, fol- 
lowed by a knightly train, enters his hut. He 
places upon Parsival's own head the "crown 
of joy and sorrow of the Grail." 

The episode of the Proud Knight of the 
Heath preserves the germ of the ancient inci- 
dent of Schionatulander and Sigune. Haupt- 
mann's Arab recalls the Priest Johannes, who 
in Wolfram's version tempts men's fancy to 
stray in distant India. In both versions 
Lohengrin is the son of Parsival. The Grail 
castle, however, is no longer a gay paradise 
where the comrades live in luxurious ease, but 
"there where God-like beings of their own 
free will suffer torment to the end that they 
may release the world from its burden and yet 
are immortal in the light of their near-by 
Paradise." 

Notwithstanding its modest pretensions as 
a child's book, Hauptmann's " Parsival " may 
be regarded as one of the most noteworthy 
modern versions of the story, a great poet's 
contribution to a great legend. It is unfor- 
tunate that the present English rendering 
should be so inadequate. jyj Q OEBEL 



RECENT FICTION.* 



Since Professor Phelps devoted a chapter 
to Michael Artzibashef in his book on the 
Russian novelists, and since the publication 
of an English translation of " Sanine " a 
year ago, the name of this writer has become 
fairly familiar to American readers. More 
recently, we have had "The Millionaire" (a 
group of three novelettes) , and now we have 
a very long novel entitled " Breaking-Point." 
The meaning of the title gradually dawns 
upon us as the characters commit suicide one 
after another, and it becomes evident that the 
author intends to sweep the board. Other- 
wise, the novel might have grown to an in- 
definitely greater length, since it has nothing 
in the nature of a rounded plot to force a 
conclusion. All these tragic people live in a 
little village of the steppes; all but one or 
two lead strictly sensual lives, without a 
gleam of the higher motives for existence; 
and when their appetites fail to provide them 
with enduring satisfaction, they naturally 
force their exits from an intolerable world. 
There is 'in the book hardly a suggestion that 
there is such a thing as morality for men and 
women, and none of these characters could 
read " Comus " with the faintest idea of its 
meaning. Their watchword seems to be: 
"Let us eat and drink (especially drink) and 
indulge the sexual passion, for to-morrow we 
die (by our own hands)." We have had 
occasion to characterize certain conspicuous 
English novels of recent years as devoted to 
a portrayal of the futility of life, but the 
gloomiest of them are optimistic tracts in 
comparison with this exhibition of the soul 
of Young Russia. The author bares this soul 
remorselessly; and if we believed his revela- 
tion to be typical, we should indeed despair 
of the great people from which he has sprung. 
But we must not forget that the people that 
claims a Gogol and a Tolstoy and a Tourgue- 
nieff has a great deal more to say for life 
than this, even when we admit a strain of 
temperamental melancholy running through 
their work: and we must not allow ourselves 
to be persuaded that M. Artzibashef speaks 
for anything more than a disillusionized sec- 
tion of the younger generation. That he 
speaks powerfully there is no question, but 
even the magic of his passages descriptive of 
nature does not go far to rescue us from de- 
pression as we contemplate his studies of the 
human animal wallowing in the trough.

The hero of " God's Man/' a lengthy novel 
by Mr. George Bronson Howard, is one Arnold 
L'Hommedieu, descended from a long line of 
distinguished ancestors, domiciled since colo- 
nial times on Long Island. The title of the 
novel is thus accounted for in a literal way; 
but the author intends it also to be taken 
symbolically, as indicating a man's struggle 
against temptation, and his underlying pur- 
pose to do God's will in a very demoralized 
world. About midway in the narrative, Ar- 
nold makes a confession which epitomizes the 
success which he has at that time attained. 
" May be you can tell me why two of my 
friends and myself who had intended to live 
decent lives and be some help to our fellows 
why we have been forced into shoddy prac- 
tices and shady lives? For exposing a rascal, 
I was expelled from college. For shielding a 
friend, I was reduced to the worst kind of 
poverty. For trying to get justice for a help- 
less woman, I got into jail. By using influ- 
ence with the most corrupt kind of politicians 
I got out. To get back to my former kind of 
life I had to accept a position with a man who 
is a wholesale poisoner. To get the little 
money I've saved, I had to blackmail my 
employer." This confession shows that 
" Ein guter Mensch in seinem dunkeln Drange 

1st sich des rechten Weges wohl bewusst." 
But we are a little dubious about accepting 
Arnold as God's man when he thereafter 
engages, from strictly sordid motives, in a 
scheme for smuggling a cargo of opium into 
the United States. The story of this enter- 
prise, and of the way in which it was finally 
thwarted, forms the core of the narrative, 
which is by no means devoid of exciting inter- 
est. Arnold's relations with the underworld 
of New York give the author an opportunity 
to display his minute knowledge of the activi- 
ties of that sphere of life, and his extraor- 
dinary acquaintance with the thieves' jargon 
\diieh in these circles serves as a medium of 
communication. The linguistic feats of Mr. 
George Ade and Mr. George M. Cohan are 
outdone in these pages. And yet, despite the 
sickening atmosphere of the novel, it displays 
a considerable degree of power, a remarkable 
gift for characterization, and a kind of philos- 
ophy of life. In its exuberance and its ar- 
resting commentary upon life it even suggests 
the later work of Mr. H. G. Wells. But it 
does not convince us that its hero is cast for 
the role implied by the title of the novel. 

Some weeks ago, we reviewed a novel in 
which American inventiveness came to the 
rescue of a world in agony, and ended the 
war by means of a device for neutralizing the 
force of gravity, whereby an aerial warship 



was constructed that should hover, massive 
and impregnable, at a convenient altitude 
over the enemy's fortress or host, and bring 
it quickly to terms. To-day, in " The Pass- 
port," by Mr. Emile Voute, we have another 
ingenious phantasy of the same type, the 
invention in this case being an asphyxiating 
gas, discharged from shells or toy balloons 
over the heads of its victims, and in a trice 
reducing them to an unconsciousness that 
lasts for several hours, but has no injurious 
after-effects. This is the most humane 
method of enforcing peace that has thus far 
been suggested. Armed with his invention, 
our hero proceeds to the theatre of war, 
has an interview with the German Emperor, 
and dictates the terms upon which the new 
weapon will be withheld from his enemies. 
When these conditions are rejected, the 
formula is turned over to the allies, and the 
German forces are speedily routed and dis- 
armed. The author writes as an American, 
although his name appears to be French, and 
he contrives to tell a singularly interesting 
story. He is beset by German spies from the 
moment when he is suspected of having some- 
thing "up his sleeve"; but his resourceful- 
ness, aided by good luck, is quite adequate to 
all the difficult situations in which he is 
placed, and whenever he gets into a fix we 
are confident that he will get out of it in the 
next chapter. The author is clearly no parti- 
san of the method that piles up agonies until 
the denouement, and then sweeps them all 
away at once, leaving us to recall our scat- 
tered senses from their bewilderment. One 
crisis at a time is his motto, and that is to be 
surmounted before the next one arises. The 
; story derives its title from a rather foolish 
wager made by the hero, to the effect that he 
will make his way through the warring camps 
without a passport. He is provided with one, 
of course, but he destroys it as an evidence 
of good faith at the time the terms of the 
wager are agreed upon.

appropriate title would be " Extra-Constitu- 
tional Government in the United States." The 
Virginia lectures undertake to show how those 
matters which were placed by the framers of 
the Constitution in the hands of the federal 
government have frequently been managed by 
agencies which are extra-constitutional and 
very different from those which were intended 
to manage them. The agencies principally 
considered in this connection are political par- 
ties and the press, the most original and illu- 
minating of the lectures being that one 
devoted to the press as the present seat of 
actual political power. It is demonstrated 
that in a democracy public opinion must some- 
how be organized in order to be effective. 
This organization was once the work almost 
entirely of party managers; but it is main- 
tained that nowadays it is through the press 
that the American people forms its opinion as 
to men and measures, and that the man who 
accomplishes most in modern politics is he 
who recognizes this fact most fully. The 
organization of public opinion by the news- 
papers instead of by the party managers has 
the advantages, we are told, of involving a 
more direct appeal to reason and of causing 
public opinion to be formed in the open; but 
it affords no necessary guarantee against 
appeals to prejudice, emotion, and impatience. 
The Oxford Lectures, on Property and Dem- 
ocracy, show how in this country a great many 
organized activities of the community have 
been kept out of government control alto- 
gether. Here are traced the gradual growth 
of political democracy in the United States, 
the essentials of the constitutional position of 
the property owner, and the more important 
recent tendencies in economics and in. legisla- 
tion. It is shown that in spite of frequent 
acts of adverse legislation the constitutional 
position of the property owner in the United 
States has been stronger than in any country 
in Europe, and that there is no nation which 
is so far removed from Socialism as ours by 
its organic law and its habits of political 
action. The rights of private property are 
substantially buttressed by numerous provi- 
sions of the Constitution, and they have re- 
mained unshaken amidst the most sweeping 
democratizing changes in the domain of poli- 
tics. Only since the opening of the present 
century has there been any serious movement 
toward State Socialism in America, the main- 
spring of this movement being popular dis- 
satisfaction aroused by the manifest failure 
of competition as a regulator of business and 
of industrial operations. Experiments in State 
control, however, are proving more costly than 
the general public knows, and Mr. Hadley 



properly concludes that the solution of the 
problem will not be reached until the public 
demand for State control of industry and for 
trained civil service go hand in hand. " Until 
the public appreciates expert work in the 
offices of state, industrial control in the United 
States is likely to remain in the hands of the 
property owner"; after that, the inference 
is, there may be a very considerable extension 
of public ownership and control.

the " Recollections of an Irish Judge : Press, 
Bar, and Parliament" (Dodd) ought to be

It is not and does not profess to be an auto- 
biography ; it is a collection of anecdotes con- 
cerning illustrious and other persons known 
or at least met with by the writer, the Hon. 
M. McD. Bodkin, K. C., in his varied activities 
as journalist, at the bar, on the bench, and in 
Parliament. Descended from the Bodkins of 
Galway, he has evidently inherited the quick- 
ness of wit that one expects to find in every 
true son of Erin; for have we not his own 
testimony to that effect in his book? Here is 
a parliamentary incident of which the narra- 
tor was the hero: "On one occasion Mr. 
Johnston, of Ballykilbeg, whose comic bigotry 
was a source of perennial amusement, ob- 
jected . . to the use in primary schools of 
the book containing Moore's song, 'Row, 
brothers, row,' on the ground that its allusion 
to 'saints of our own green isle' inculcated 
the worship of saints. Before the Minister 
could reply I popped up with a supplemen- 
tary question. ' Is the right honourable gen- 
tleman aware,' I asked, with a face as grave 
as a mustard-pot, 'that in the intermediate 
schools and universities they require the 
study of an alleged poet named Homer, who 
encourages the worship of Jupiter, .Juno, 
Venus and other objectionable personages ? ' ' 
and "the uproarious laughter of the House" 
told him he had scored. Parnell, Gladstone, 
Justin McCarthy, and other notables figure in

Wister, who was in Germany shortly before 
the war began, tells first of the delightful 
impressions made on him by the smiling order- 
liness and smooth efficiency of life there. But 
months and years before this, as he now be- 
lieves, Germany had been crouching for her 
spring. In his opinion, she had been mad- 
dened by self-esteem, the mania of grandeur 
complemented by the mania of persecution. 
The Superman, the Superrace, and the Super- 
state were the new Trinity of her worship, 
and war became for her a sort of holy crusade. 
Then in a short chapter he gives a composite 
statement of Prussianism, compiled sentence 
by sentence from the utterances of the Kaiser 
and some of his most illustrious subjects, 
which, it must be granted, goes far to confirm 
his thesis. There is very little discussion in 
the book, and perhaps no new fact is brought 
out unless it be the amazing confession, 
which the author ascribes to Prince Lich- 
nowsky, that the Kaiser had sent him as 
ambassador to England to find out when the 
English were so embroiled in their own domes- 
tic troubles as to enable Germany to strike 
her blow on the Continent with impunity. 
Mr. Wister ends by pointing out the special 
significance of the struggle for America, who, 
he thinks, cannot stand aside with mute lips 
and folded arms while what he regards as the 
deadliest assault ever made on democracy is 
being perpetrated in Europe. 



Desultory studies '' A Q ulet p m * Library," 

in four by Mr. William Henry Hudson, 

wooes the reader by its title and 
wins him by its agreeable contents. Four 
authors are discussed in as many chapters. 
They are Thomas Hood, Henry Carey, George 
Lillo, and Samuel Richardson. The Lillo 
paper gives a foretaste of a more elaborate 
work, now nearing completion, on " George 
Lillo and the Middle Class Drama of the 
Eighteenth Century '' ; the article on Hood is 
expanded from a lecture prepared many years 
ago for California hearers; but nothing in 
the book has before been printed. Good read- 
ing will be found between the covers of this 
compact little volume, even though there is 
nothing in the subjects chosen or the treat- 
ment of them to give promise of novelty. But 
a certain freshness of interest felt by the 
writer is likely to communicate itself to the 
reader. In his thirty-three pages on Henry 
Carey, Mr. Hudson rather unaccountably 
omits all mention of the one production that 
in some if not in many minds is most nearly 
associated with that oddly gifted genius. 
Though the authorship of " God Save the 
King" is ascribed to Carey without conclu- 



sive proof, yet it is thus generally ascribed, 
and to tell his story without the slightest ref- 
erence to that famous anthem is somewhat 
like narrating the life of Newton with no 
allusion to the law of gravitation. It is even 
asserted by Mr. Hudson that of all Carey's 
works, " the one which, leaving ' Sally in Our 
Alley ' out of the question, has done most to 
preserve his name from oblivion . . is ' Chro-, 
nonhotonthologos.' " It is a good and schol- 
arly book, however, and its closing chapter, 
on Richardson, is perhaps the best of the 
four. (Rand, McNally & Co.)

is often asserted that while the 
rich are growing richer, the poor are growing 
poorer. In his volume entitled " The Wealth 
and Income of the People of the United 
States" (Macmillan), Dr. Willford Isbell 
King defines wealth and income, and dis- 
cusses the distribution of wealth and of in- 
come in this country among the factors of 
production, corporations, and families. The 
book is based upon a careful study of various 
sources, both public and private. The author 
does not claim mathematical exactness for his 
conclusions, but believes that they are approx- 
imately correct. Good evidence is produced 
to show that " since 1876 there has occurred 
a marked concentration of income in the 
hands of the very rich; that the poor have 
lost, relatively, but little; but that the mid- 
dle class has been the principal sufferer." In 
some cases the poorest four-fifths of the popu- 
lation own scarcely ten per cent of the total 
wealth, while the richest two per cent own 
almost three-fifths. Whether the individual 
is to be regarded as a gainer by this condition 
of affairs will depend upon the answers 
offered to a number of questions of economic 
and social import.- The facts gathered are 
interesting in themselves, and are presented 
in an orderly way, subject to some criticism 
of details.

Interest at large in the seem-

These performances range from the doing of 
simple sums in arithmetic to the reputed ex- 
traction of the roots of large numbers. Some 
horses, on the other hand, exhibit an apti- 
tude for spelling. Mr. E. M. Smith, in his

telepathy, an unknown sense, and of fraud as 
adequate explanations. He analyzes the evi- 
dence, put forward by Pfungst and others, of 
unconscious involuntary signs on the part of 
the interrogator (who is generally the trainer 
of the horse), such as infinitesimal move- 
ments of the head or eyes which give the 
horse his cue. He cites as militating against 
this explanation the success of blinded horses, 
the marked individual preferences of the 
horses, the nature of the errors made, and the 
evidences of indecision in the replies. On the 
whole, he believes that the evidence tends to 
discountenance the sign theory; but that, 
with a few notable and as yet unexplained 
exceptions, all of the feats so far achieved 
might be accounted for by association, involv- 
ing an excellent memory but not certainly 
any rational process. The booklet is a brief 
and inadequate summary of the main facts 
and theories regarding the evolution of intel- 
ligence among animals, from the lowest to the 
highest, as evidenced by behavior. The au- 
thor avoids extensive considerations of the 
much debated tropism theory, and fails to 
utilize a wide range of available and valuable 
material from the insect world. 



Bitsoftra aedv The ""Woman Homesteader"

ming life in further communications to her 
'' dear Mrs. Coney," and this time the packet 
of letters is entitled "Letters on' an Elk 
Hunt " (Houghton). It was on or during the 
hunting excursion of two months in the au- 
tumn of 1914 that the letters were written, not 
about the hunt, except a few pages ; and thus 
it is that so much of the writer's well-known 
skill in depicting character and incident finds 
room for exercise. Humor and pathos, trag- 
edy and comedy, romance and realism, suc- 
cessively enrich these unstudied accounts of 
every-day persons and events amid the hard 
conditions of the western frontier. Mrs. 
Stewart has a genius for discovering heroic 
characters in humble life, and for making her 
readers feel that heroism. She can also pre- 
sent the amusing or otherwise interesting side 
of any man, woman, or child not hopelessly 
devoid of interest. Her great-hearted Mrs. 
O'Shaughnessy and sturdily unromantic Mrs. 
Louderer reappear in this book, and new 
friends are introduced, including two prom- 
ising youngsters that Mrs. O'Shaughnessy 
feels irresistibly moved to adopt on the jour- 
ney. To what extent (if any) Mrs. Stewart 
had designs on a book-reading and book- 
buying public in writing this second series of 



letters, is a matter of conjecture; but her 
pages have the freshness and naturalness that 
one looks for in the friendly correspondence of 
a bright and observant woman. 



If you can't see the difference,

such a series of distinguo's Dr. H. M. Kallen 
is led after a searching analysis and com- 
parison of the Jamesian and the Bergsonian 
philosophies. For this task the author, who 
was for several years in intimate contact with 
James, and who edited James's unfinished 
" Some Problems in Philosophy," is eminently 
fitted. In his "William James and Henri 
Bergson : A Study in Contrasting Theories of 
Life" (University of Chicago Press), Dr. Kal- 
len argues that James's, and not Bergson's, is 
the theory of life that " faces forward " ; that 
in their Weltanschauung, in the intuitional 
and the pragmatic methods, and in the result- 
ing implications about God, the universe, and 
man, the two philosophies, despite current 
near-identification, are fundamentally and 
diametrically opposed. These challenging 
conclusions Dr. Kallen expounds, for the 
Packman, with painstaking detail; for the 
layman, with a captivating style; for both, 
with the zeal of the disciple. 



Mr. Arthur Machen more than 

half slls P ects that the recent 
crop of legends concerning sun- 
dry miraculous occurrences in the critical 
retreat from Mons may all have sprung from 
seed of his own sowing, in the shape of a little 
story that he wrote and sent to a London 
newspaper in the early days of the war. This 
fanciful tale now reappears as the first in a 
little book of stories, " The Bowmen, and 
Other Legends of the War" (Putnam), all 
by Mr. Machen, and all in similar vein, par- 
taking of the supernatural and appealing to 
the credulous reader's love of the miraculous. 
The Bowmen in question are ghostly archers 
led to the rescue of the hard-pressed English 
by England's patron saint. Such tales of 
celestial succor seem to have spread from one 
end of the Anglo-French battle-line to the 
other, and it appears more likely that they are 
all traceable to the peculiar horror, the stupen- 
dous magnitude and unspeakable awfulness. 
of the titanic struggle, than to any single 
invention. But the curious in such matters will 
enjoy Mr. Machen 's argumentative introduc- 
tion and postscript. The book is a slight pro- 
duction, but of considerable present interest.

A record of the achievements of " The Irish 
Abroad," written by Mr. Elliot O'Donnell, is an- 
nounced for early issue by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
& Co. It begins with the first authentic migra- 
tions, and comes down to the present day. 

We have received word from Mr. Alfred A. 
Knopf that he has taken over from Messrs. George 
H. Doran Co. the publishing rights to Dr. J. W. 
Mackail's "Russia's Gift to the World" and Dr. 
Paul Vinogradoff's " The Russian Problem," both 
of which were reviewed in our issue of Sept. 30. 

A new series of Russian fiction in English trans- 
lation is projected by Messrs. John W. Luce & Co.

in preparation : Tchekov's " The Bet, and Other 
Tales " ; Danchenko's two novels, " With a 



Diploma" and "The Whirlwind"; Korolenko's 
"The Blind Musician"; and Kuprin's "The 
Shulamite." 

An important item, hitherto unannounced, on 
Messrs. Scribner's autumn list is Mr. Ralph 
Adams Cram's " Heart of Europe," embodying 
descriptions of the architectural treasures of those 
towns of northeastern France and of Belgium 
which have been damaged or endangered in the 
present war. 

To the " Wayfarer's Library " will be immedi- 
ately added four new volumes (all novels). Their 
titles are : " Seaf orth Highlanders," by Mr. 
F. W. Walker; " Blackwatch," by Messrs. L. Cope 
Cornford and F. W. Walker; "In the Wake of 
King James," by Mr. Standish O'Grady; and 
" Rosemary's Letter Book," by Mr. W. L. Court-

" The Life of Clara Barton " by Mr. Percy H.

nounced for immediate publication. This, the first

cooperation of the friends and relatives of Miss 
Barton. Mr. Epler has had access to many unpub- 
lished letters and diaries, and also to official re- 
ports and documents. 

Lockhart's " History of Napoleon Buonaparte " 
has been edited by Dr. Holland Rose for the 
"Oxford Editions of Standard Authors." Two 
other forthcoming additions to the same series are 
Creasy's " Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World," 
with an Introduction by Mr. H. W. C. Davis; and 
" Stories and Poems " by Bret Harte, edited by 
Mr. William Macdonald. 

The death of Henri Fabre lends unusual inter- 
est to the latest volume of translated matter from 
the great naturalist's "Souvenirs Entomologiques." 
This volume, devoted to " The Hunting Wasps," 
will appear immediately. The publishers, Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co., have prepared an illustrated 
booklet devoted to Fabre's life and work, which 
they are glad to send without charge upon request. 

The first number of the " Technical Book Re- 
view Index," a selected list of important technical 
and scientific books and book reviews in leading 
journals, has been issued by the Index Office of 
Chicago. The compilation has been made by the 
Technology Department of the Carnegie Library 
of Pittsburgh. The Index is to appear quarterly, 
and will embrace from two to three thousand titles 
annually. The aim, to make the work done for one 
library of service to the many, is praiseworthy. 

Among other historical works announced for 
autumn publication by the Oxford University 
Press are the following : " Lord Selkirk's Work 
in Canada," by Professor Chester Martin ; " The 
Evolution of Prussia," by Messrs. J. A. JR. Mar-

THE DIAL 



[ Oct. 28 



" Women at The Hague," a narrative account of 
the International Congress of Women held at The 
Hague last spring, will soon be issued by the 
Macmillan Co. The authors are Jane Addams, 
Emily Greene Balch, and Alice Hamilton. The 
volume will contain an appendix on continuous 
mediation by a delegate to the Congress from the 
University of Wisconsin, as well as the resolutions 
adopted by the Congress. Among the chapter- 
titles are the following : " Journey and Impres- 
sions of the Congress," " The Women at the 
Congress," " Civil Government in Time of War," 
" Journey to the Northern Capital," and " Factors 
in Continuing the War." 

There are not a few readers to whom one of the 
most welcome announcements of the season is that 
of a new collection of Mr. Austin Dobson's de- 
lightful eighteenth-century vignettes. " Rosalba's 
Journal and Other Papers " is the title of the 
forthcoming volume. In addition to Rosalba Car- 
riera, the Venetian miniature painter whose jour- 
nal during her stay in Paris in 1720-21 gives the 
book its title, there are papers on Matthew Prior's 
" noble, lovely, little Peggy," the Duchess of Port- 
land, Streatham Place, Lord George Gordon and 
the Gordon Riots, and the early years of Madame 
Royale. "A New Dialogue of the Dead," in which 
the author conceives an interview between Henry 
Fielding and his first biographer, Arthur Murphy, 
brings the volume to a close. 

John Bishop Putnam, son of the founder of the 
Putnam publishing house, and brother of Mr. 
George Haven Putnam, its present head, and of 
Mr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of the Library of 
Congress, died on the 7th of this month in his 
sixty-seventh year. He was born on Staten Island, 
N. Y., July 17, 1849, educated at Clark and Fan- 
ning's Collegiate Institute in New York City, and 
at the Pennsylvania Agricultural College; entered 
the publishing house of G. P. Putnam's Sons in 
1868, and was its treasurer at the time of his 
death. The Knickerbocker Press, which prints the 
Putnam publications, was under his management 
as president. He was a member of the New York 
Typothetae and of the Society of Mechanics and 
Tradesmen, New York. "Authors and Publishers " 
came from his pen in 1890, and "A Norwegian 
Ramble " in 1902. 

A new study of " Maurice Maeterlinck : Poet 
and Philosopher" has been written by Miss Mac- 
donald Clark, a distinguished student of Edin- 
burgh University, who has specialized in the 
literature of the Low Countries. M. Maeterlinck 
has written in highest praise of the work, and 
bears testimony with no little surprise to the 
ingenious synthesis which it develops. His char- 
acteristic modesty in this respect is shown in the 
following sentences from his letter : " The writer 
seems to believe, with only too much indulgence, 
that from the first day, from the first book of my 
writing, I had my way traced out before me, and 
that I knew what I was going to say, what I meant 
to do ; when like every sincere man who is only 
groping his way I do not know even to-day." 
The book is to be published this month by Messrs. 
George Allen & Unwin, Ltd., of London. 



John Edmands, the dean of American librarians 
and the originator of classification and numbering 
systems now in general use in libraries through- 
out the country, died at his home in Philadelphia 
on the 17th inst. He was ninety-five years old. 
Mr. Edmands was born in Framingham, Mass., 
and was graduated from Yale University in 1847. 
In 1848-51 he attended the Yale Divinity School, 
in the meanwhile teaching school. He entered on 
library work in 1845, when he took charge of the 
library of the College Society of Brothers in 
Unity. Mr. Edmands continued in library work 
until 1901, when he became Librarian Emeritus 
of the Mercantile Library in Philadelphia, his total 
service covering fifty-six years. From 1851 to 
1856 he was in charge of the Yale College Library, 
and then went to the Mercantile Library, where 
he stayed for forty-five years. He is the author 
of several bibliographies. 

A considerable number of Belgium's most dis- 
tinguished writers and artists, now refugees in 
England, have cooperated in the production of a 
noteworthy volume which the John Lane Co. an- 
nounces under the title, "A Book of Belgium's 
Gratitude." The work is being issued under the 
highest authority. His Majesty King Albert is 
the patron ; His Excellency M. Paul Hymans, Bel- 
gian Minister in London, is the president, and 
MM. Emile Cammaerts, Emile Glaus, Henri Da- 
vignon, Jules Destree, Paul Lambotte, Caron Mon- 
cheur, and Chevalier E. Carton de Wiart are 
members of the Committee of Publication. The 
book will be printed in French and English, and 
the list of translators will include many well- 
known English names. Mr. W. J. Locke has con- 
sented to act as Translation Editor. The profits 
from the publication are to he placed at the dis- 
posal of Queen Mary of England. 

Charles Frederick Holder, author and natural- 
ist, died at his home in Pasadena, Calif., on the 
10th inst., in his sixty-fifth year. He was born in 
Lynn, Mass., and received his education at the 
U. S. Naval Academy, and at the Friends' School 
in Providence. From 1871 to 1875 he was assis- 
tant curator of zoology in the American Museum 
of Natural History, and later he occupied the 
chair of zoology at Throop University in Pasa- 
dena. Always an enthusiastic fisherman, Dr. 
Holder founded the Tuna Club of Catalina Island, 
and was a member of leading fishing clubs 
throughout the world. He was the author of 
many books, and was regarded as one of the 
foremost marine authorities in the world. Among 
the best known of his works are " Elements of 
Zoology," " Marvels of Animal Life," " The Ivory 
King," " Living Lights," "A Strange Company," 
"A Frozen Dragon," "Louis Agassiz, His Life," 
"Life of Charles Darwin," "Along the Florida 
Reef," " The Treasure Divers," " Stories of Ani- 
mal Life," "Big Game Fishes of the United 
States," " The Lower Animals," " Fishes and Rep- 
tiles," " Hand Book to Submarine Gardens," " The 
Log of a Sea Angler," " Big Game at Sea," 
"Marine Animals of the Pacific Coast," "The 
Ocean," and "Angling Adventures around the 
World."

Digestion 

Indigestion and Constipation are so common 
they cause so much needless pain and suffering 
and lead to so many ills more dangerous, that 
Dr. John Harvey Kellogg has written a book tell- 
ing how Constipation and Indigestion may be 
relieved and prevented. Dr. Kellogg is the greatest 
authority in the world on diet and digestion. He 
has invented many health foods, and for nearly 
forty years has been Superintendent of the Battle 
Creek Sanitarium, where he has had opportunity 
to observe, treat, and prescribe for thousands of 
cases. This means that Dr. Kellogg writes from 
experience deals with facts, not theory. The 
teachings of Dr. Kellogg's book, "Colon 
Hygiene," are easy to follow right in your own 
home. He tells you the dangers of Constipation 
and Indigestion how to remove their causes and 
natural methods of relief which are easy to apply. 
Reading this book will profit you. Nearly 400 
pages. Many illustrations, diet table and full 
instructions for exercise, rest, and sleep. Cloth $2;

ROBERT FROST 

THE NEW AMERICAN POET 

North of Boston 

ALICE BROWN: 



THERE IS A RARE 
NOTE */ SPONTA- 
NEOUS ENTHUSI- 
ASM IN THESE 
COMMENTS 



"Mr. Frost has done truer work about New England than anybody except 
Miss Wilkins." 
CHARLES HANSON TOWNE: 

"Nothing has come out of America since Whitman so splendid, so real, so over- 
whelmingly great. ' ' 

AMY LOWELL in The New Republic: 

"A bock of unusual power and sincerity. A remarkable achievement." 

New York Evening Sun: 

"The poet had the insight to trust the people with a book of the people and 
the people replied 'Man, what is your name?' . . . He forsakes utterly 
the claptrap of pastoral song, classical or modern. . . His is soil stuff, not 
mock bucolics." 

Boston Transcript: 

"The first poet for half a century to express New England life completely with 
a fresh, original and appealing way of his own." 

Brooklyn Daily Eagle: 

"The more you read the more you are held, and when you return a few days 
later to look up some passage that has followed you about, the better you find 
the meat under the simple unpretentious form. The London Times caught that 
quality when it said : ' Poetry burns up out of it, as when a faint wind breathes 
upon smouldering embers.' . . That is precisely the effect. . ." 

Reedy's Mirror: 

"Genuine poetry, these 'North of Boston' tales, they hold one with the grip 
of a vivid novel. . . I can only refer my readers to 'North of Boston' for 
acquaintance with what seems to me a fine achievement; such achievement, 
indeed, as contributes vitally to the greatness of a country's most national and 
significant literature." 

FORD MADOX HUEFFER in The Lon- EDWARD THOMAS in The New Weekly: 

don Outlook: "Few who read it through will have 

"Mr. Frost's achievement is much been ag much astonished b an 

finer, much more near the ground, and A . . TTT1 . 

much more national, in the true sense, American since Whitman. . . It 

than anything that Whitman gave to 1S drama with a lyncal intensity which 

the world." often borders on the magic."

SOME SCRIBNER BOOKS 



HEART OF EUROPE 

By Ralph Adams Cram 

Nothing could be a more timely or valuable contribution to the knowledge of what the great _war means 
than this book. The description of the cities like Liege, Louvain, Malines, Rheims, Laon, Spissons, and 
Namur, which have been victims, is eloquent far beyond the mere marshalling of facts and pictures; it is 
not possible to read it without a thrill of deepest sympathy with Mr. Cram's love of what he describes and 
his sense of its loss or peril.

THE FOUNTAINS OF PAPAL ROME 

By Mrs. Charles MacVeagh 

One of the most characteristic features of the Eternal City is the quantity of magnificent fountains 
served by the exceptionally abundant water-supply. Of papal Rome, particularly, these monuments may 
almost be said to summarize the story. Mrs. MacVeagh has treated them in this sense as well as 
describing them with artistic sympathy. Each one is the nucleus of a wealth of historical associations as 
well as an object of sculptural and architectural interest.

FRENCH MEMORIES OF EIGHTEENTH 
CENTURY AMERICA 

By Charles H. Sherrill 

An extremely vivid, lively, and instructive presentation of a most interesting period of our history, 
based upon the memoirs, and other forms of recorded observation and commentary of those French men 
and women who visited this country between 1775 and 1800 many of them to assist in our war for liberty.

THE FIGHTING CHEYENNES 

By George Bird Grinnell 

It would be hard to find a book so full of action, adventure, and stratagem or of heroism and self- 
sacrifice as this first full history of a great and typical tribe by one of the first living authorities on the 
American Indian. It will be surprising if it does not become a classic in its literature.

FIGHTING FRANCE DUNKERQUE TO BELFORT 

By Edith Wharton 

A book on the author's experiences and impressions of France in the war, including her own visits to 
different parts of the French battle line. Commenting upon the vividness and dramatic intensity of some 
of these, an editorial writer in the New York Times says: "What that hard-won knowledge of human 
misery, cruelty, tenderness, and courage known as war will effect in the work of such a consummate artist 
as Mrs. Wharton is the secret of the literature of the future."

VIVE LA FRANCE! 

By E. Alexander Powell 

This intensely interesting record of Mr. Powell's second visit to the front is the result of the very 
unusual opportunities accorded him as a correspondent. The book describes, among other things, the 
bombardment of Dunkirk, the destruction of Soissons, the fighting on the Aisne, the invasion of Alsace, 
the battle of Neuve Chapelle, the second battle of Ypres, the poison gas, etc.

THE LYEIC LORD. 



Of all forms of verse, the lyric alone still 
remains in the ascendant. It does not ex- 
actly keep the zenith, nor is it allowed to 
burn clear and unobscured. But it is at least 
aloft in the literary sky, whereas the epic, the 
poetic drama, the narrative poem, and the 
ballad are muffled in clouds on the horizon. 
Poetry in lyric roles is still allowed to flaunt 
itself a courtier of the sun ; though of course 
it is not quite equal to the aldermanic or 
beadle-like figures of prose. In its other 
forms, however, it is a Belisarius begging for 
obols in the shadow. 

How shall we account for the popularity, 
or at least the permitted existence, of the 
lyric ? That it is brief may have something to 
do with it. " 'Tis a very excellent piece of 
work ; would 't were done ! " says the ennuied 
Christopher Sly ; and the modern intellectual 
helot echoes him in regard to long poems. 
But the short story and the essay have not 
displaced the novel, the history, the book of 
travels or biography. Poe thought that a long 
poem was impossible because it could not be 
read at a sitting, and so must lose its totality 
of effect. But what we can read at a sitting 
depends on the character of our minds and 
the interest of the piece of work itself. Most 
of us have often sat up nights to get through 
some enthralling novel three times as long as 
the " Iliad " or " Paradise Lost." Mere brev- 
ity will hardly explain the lyric's hold on the 
public mind. 

The fact is that lyrical poetry is usually 
the expression of emotion, and the capacity 
for emotion is universal. Anyone can recog- 
nize a natural feeling or instinctive mood of 
the soul put into words ; whereas the ordered 
designs and logical sequences of the drama or 
narrative poem require thought and labor to 
understand. Again, the movement and the 
music of lyrical poetry are as a rule more 
apparent, more obvious, though not loftier or 
nobler, than those of the continuous verse 
forms. Even the great mass of the unmusical 
like to hum or whistle some short recollected 
air : we do not expect of them the intelligence 
or effort to appreciate Beethoven or Brahms.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 11 



Its emotional quality and its lively or striking 
musical accent would therefore seem to be the 
secrets of such hold as the lyric retains. 

It has been said that with a thorough 
knowledge of the Bible and Shakespeare and 
Gibbon's "Rome" a man would be educated. 
We do not think that the study of lyrical 
poetry would amount to a liberal education. 
Too much of the spectacle of life, its intellect 
and action, would be left out. But for the 
training and stimulation of the emotions, 
lyrical poetry alone would very nearly suffice. 
What feelings, what instincts, are there, which 
have not been perfectly expressed by it? 
Religious ecstasy, patriotism, martial ardor, 
love in all its moods, hope, joy, resignation, 
the beckonings of nature, the brotherhood 
of man, all the agitations and intoxications 
which lift and sweep us out of dulness and 
routine, ring from the vibrant chords of the 
lyric lyre. 

If we should say that a lyric is primarily 
a gush of emotion, more vivid in picture and 
more vital in movement than other verse 
forms, we should perhaps define its central 
type. This would exclude narration and 
character creation, and also overmuch medita- 
tion. But it is a question whether the ballad 
is or is not a lyric. The odes of Pindar are 
full of mythological episodes. Some of the 
so-called Homeric hymns are pure narrative. 
Dry den's "Alexander's Feast " is a story. And 
the sonnets of Shakespeare and Wordsworth, 
Tennyson's " In Memoriam," and a multitude 
of other pieces usually classed as lyrical, are 
weighted with the profoundest meditation. 
Thus do art forms elude limitations. 

Taking the world over, the variety of lyric 
forms is very great. By means of the chorus 
it interpenetrated the Greek drama. The 
Book of Job and the Song of Solomon are 
half lyrical and half dramatic. Dante's 
great trilogy is more like a lyric than an epic 
poem. Every race has its own lyrical forms. 
In the time of the Irish Bards, or of the Trou- 
badours and Minnesingers, men must have put 
in as much time in metrical invention as we 
give to the making of machines. In English 
poetry the lyric falls into four or five great 
divisions, the ode, the somewhat related 
forms of the elegy and the epithalamium, the 
song, and the sonnet. There are, of course, 
minor forms, such as the religious hymn, the 
epigram, and possibly others. 



The stanzaic and the irregular ode are the 
two species of this form in English. The first 
of these is of two sorts, the pure Pindaric 
ode, with its strophe, antistrophe, and epode; 
and the ode where but one stanzaic form is 
repeated throughout. Gray's "Bard" and 
"Progress of Poetry" are the only famous 
Pindaric odes in the language. Cowley made 
an awful mess of the business, and Shelley 
muddled it still further. The latter poet puts 
his epode before his strophe, and makes no 
attempt to repeat the metres of the three 
divisions. To the trained mind, there is some- 
thing inexplicably pleasing in the regulated 
motion of the three parts of the poem, re- 
peated, as they usually are, two or three times. 
The strophe is like a line of figures in a dance, 
moving toward the spectator; in the anti- 
strophe they retrace their steps, and in the 
epode they break up into lively groups. 

The stanzaic form of ode is very much more 
common in English, and it boasts by far the 
greatest number of successes. Such include 
Milton's "Ode on the Nativity," Gray's "Eton 
College" and the "Hymn to Adversity," 
Wordsworth's "Ode to Duty," Shelley's 
" Skylark," Keats's " Grecian Urn " and " Ode 
to a Nightingale," and scores of others. 

The irregular ode also seems natural to 
English poets, though the triumphs in it are 
much fewer than in the stanzaic form. Words- 
worth's "Intimations" is the greatest of these, 
and Dryden's "Alexander's Feast," Collins's 
"Passions" and "Liberty," Tennyson's "Death 
of Wellington," and Lowell's "Commemora- 
tion Ode " the other pieces of high rank. The 
form is "free verse" with a vengeance: the 
writer changes the length of his stanza or 
lines, and their rhythm and movement, as his 
mood dictates. Theoretically, this ought to 
consort with " poetic frenzy " ; but the human 
mind prefers the circumscribed and the sym- 
metrical, and discipline usually wins out over 
lawlessness. 

Of the great English elegies, Milton's 
"Lycidas" can scarcely be called irregular. 
It is a mighty gush of music, breathed forth 
almost without stop, written in smooth-slip- 
ping couplets and quatrains with only the 
occasional break of a short line. The other 
best known pieces of this kind, Shelley's 
"Adonais," Arnold's " Thyrsis," Tennyson's 
"In Memoriam," Swinburne's "Ave atque 
Vale," are stanzaic in form. The rarity of

great wedding songs in the language would 
seem to imply that our writers of the English 
tongue did not hold the marriage state in high 
regard; but we suspect that the lack is due 
rather to their reticence about that relation. 
Spenser's two pieces are the only famous epi- 
thalamia that come to mind; though perhaps 
Suckling's sparkling "Ballad of a Wedding" 
could properly be classed with this genre. 

It is plain that what we have been describ- 
ing are lofty and elaborate performances of 
the Muse. Lyrical they are, but they are not 
central in their type. The song is really the 
norm of lyrical poetry. It is not only capable 
of being sung, as the longer works scarcely 
are, but it answers better to the instinctive 
and emotional qualities of the form. If this 
is so, then Burns is certainly the central lyrist 
of our language, and possibly of the race. 
No lyrical poet in the world outranges him. 
Passion, pathos, heroic ardor, pure imagina- 
tion, fun, satire, and world-upsetting humor 
are all within his compass. It is a curious 
fact that more of his songs have been set to 
music and widely sung than of any other 
really great poet. As a rule, composers seem 
to fight shy of words which would compete in 
effect with their tones. Shakespeare, Shelley, 
and Tennyson come next in their count of 
song successes. Perfect and lovely and varied 
as their pieces are, there is a touch of art, of 
brain-work, in them which makes them just a 
trifle set and artificial as compared with the 
purely instinctive and natural utterances of 
Burns. The Elizabethan dramatists and 
lyrists, the Cavalier poets, the Scottish minor 
poets, Campbell, Sir Walter himself, whose 
wealth of lyric poetry is scarcely realized by 
the world, hidden as it is in the mass of his 
work, these and scattered writers through 
the ages have added vastly to the English 
stock of lyrical poetry. One good song has 
been found enough for an immortality. The 
Irish poets, Moore, James Clarence Mangan, 
and George Darley, are melodists and pas- 
sionists of the first water. Barley's "Innis- 
f alien " is one of the great war lyrics of the 
language. Emily Bronte's half a dozen fine 
lyrics give her precedence among the women 
poets; they are as intense as Sappho's frag- 
ments, though they have not Sappho's perfec- 
tion of picture. Poe fused the Irish gift of 
melody and the Welsh gift of picture, and his 
dozen or so lyrical pieces are unsurpassed. 



He does not possess Burns's immense range, 
otherwise he might stand side by side with 
the latter. 

The sonnet draws away from the central 
lyric type on the side of meditation, as much 
as the ode and elegy do on the side of narra- 
tive and description. Yet such sonnets as 
Milton's "Avenge, Lord, thy slaughtered 
hosts " and Shakespeare's " Let me not to the 
marriage of true minds " ring out like trum- 
pet notes. The first question about the sonnet 
is one of form. Which is best, the Italian or 
the Shakespearean model? Two such high 
judges of verse as Tennyson and Palgrave 
gave the preference to the latter. And Scho- 
penhauer, in his greatest philosophical work, 
devotes a page to proving the superiority of 
the Italian form. Roughly speaking, this 
form tends to the abstract ; the Shakespearean, 
to the concrete. The former is likely to go off 
into sound, while the latter turns into picture. 
The sonnet is a small thing, it has not even 
the ordinary length of a song in which to 
develop itself, and it must therefore be con- 
centrated. Now concentration is best secured 
by vividness of image. To our mind, at least, 
there are about fifty of Shakespeare's son- 
nets which have more of this concentration 
and vividness than any others. Yet Keats 
and Wordsworth occasionally reach an equal 
objectivity. In Rossetti's, which are the best 
regular sonnets of recent times, the concen- 
tration is overdone. They become vague and 
monotonous by too much particularity. They 
are so rich in image that they surfeit us, 
like a cake which is all plums. A rich sim- 
plicity, that is the ideal which the sonnet- 
writer should aim at. Perhaps it is the ideal 
of all art. There have been many attempted 
innovations in the number and order of 
rhymes of the sonnet; but no one has yet 
improved upon the two great forms. The 
Italians have a form of sonnet con coda, with 
a tail, which has never been naturalized in 
English. 

It may be said in favor of the lyric that it 
is essential poetry. It does something that 
cannot be done in prose. The creative mind 
can work with the latter material, though it 
loses a good deal by putting off the wings and 
cloud-apparel of verse. The prose epic, the 
novel, and the prose drama may be very 
great ; but the prose lyric practically does not 
exist. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN LONDON, 

THE AUTUMN PUBLISHING SEASON. NEW 

WORK OF THE YOUNGER ENGLISH POETS. 

BACON versus SHAKESPEARE ONCE MORE. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

The autumn publishing season has opened 
here. It will be a flat affair. One or two of 
the lesser houses have increased their output, 
and are pouring forth floods of cheap novels ; 
but most of the lists are much shorter than 
usual, and one of the most important firms in 
England presents a list only a quarter of the 
normal length. From publishers and book- 
sellers alike I gather that the reduction is 
fully justified by the falling-off in sales. The 
lighter novels are selling well, and the minute 
sales of poetry are less minute than usual. 
But the demand for war books except for 
the class in which the future settlement is 
seriously discussed has dropped almost to 
nothing (for one cannot go on reading for 
ever the same remarks about Huns and 
Kultur) ; and all kinds of " heavy " books are 
unsaleable. The purely decorative books 
the bibliophile's book and the expensive illus- 
trated edition have naturally gone the way 
of all luxuries. The new Budget has given 
them the coup de grace. Little of interest, in 
fact, may be expected to issue from this side 
during the present season. 

About the most interesting of the announce- 
ments, to my mind, is that of a second volume 
of "Georgian Poetry." The first volume of 
this anthology of the work of certain of our 
younger poets appeared three years ago ; and 
its success has been so great that its editor 
(who half-conceals his identity under the 
qualified anonymity of the initials "E. M.") 
has compiled another. I do not know exactly 
what material he has got together this time; 
but if the new collection is as good as the old 
it should be very useful. For the majority 
even of intelligent readers have as yet no idea 
at all of the profusion of good poetry which 
was produced in England during the ten or 
twelve years before the war. You may put 
aside the most distinguished of the long- 
established poets, Mr. Bridges, Mr. Yeats, 
"A. E.," and Mr. A. E. Housman, none of 
whom has done much in recent years; and 
you may also put aside Mr. Thomas Hardy, 
who, having deserted fiction, is writing in his 
green old age lyrics of extreme originality 
full of a new music. There still remains a body 
of writers whose work would entitle this age 
to consider itself richly productive. Rupert 
Brooke and James Elroy Flecker have, un- 
happily, died young since " Georgian Poetry " 



appeared ; but Mr. Sturge Moore, Mr. W. H. 
Davies, and Mr. Walter de la Mare are still 
writing, and none of them has passed early 
middle age. Not one of these men, perhaps, 
can be called a great poet; they are all of 
them, if you care for classifications, in the 
ranks of the lesser immortals. But each of 
them unlike those poetic aftermaths of the 
mid-nineteenth century who are so well-known 
on both sides of the Atlantic is original and 
individual, and their work is very varied. 
Mr. Sturge Moore, the one man of our time 
who can write on classical subjects without 
writing at second-hand, is best read in bulk: 
except in a few poems like " The Gazelles " an 
unfamiliar reader will never get his quality out 
of a selection. Mr. Davies, on the other hand, 
has written about three hundred "nature- 
poems"; of which, say, forty are perfect, as 
many others rather taking, and the rest imita- 
tions of his better self. Mr. de la Mare has not 
written very much verse, but if " The Listen- 
ers," "Arabia," and a dozen other of his lyrics 
do not last, posterity will not know its busi- 
ness; and Rupert Brooke and Flecker, had 
they lived, might have done very fine things, 
for they both had, everything else apart, un- 
usual intellects, the full powers of which they 
had only begun to apply. All these poets 
were represented in the Georgian Book ; and 
others, such as Mr. Gordon Bottomley (who 
has written a few extraordinarily fascinating 
things), and Mr. Masefield, whose "Biog- 
raphy" (which was included) is a much bet- 
ter poem than those celebrated narratives in 
which he held the mirror up to the flabber- 
gasted populations of rural England. I 
would not be misunderstood. I do not think 
that everything in the Georgian Book was 
good, for there were certainly a few bad 
poems and a few unnecessary names in the 
book. And I am far from contending that 
there is as yet any evidence that this genera- 
tion has been, or will be, as fruitful as that 
which was illuminated by (though it did not, 
in most cases, purchase) Wordsworth, Cole- 
ridge, Shelley, Keats, and Byron. But there 
was before the war an unmistakable stir in 
the air, a new atmosphere of keenness, a new 
intellectual fervor, and a strongly marked 
tendency on the part of the most sensitive and 
intelligent of the young men to dedicate them- 
selves to verse rather than to any other me- 
dium of expression. This last tendency was 
and is so obvious that it is the commonest 
thing to hear people asking whence on earth 
the next group of good novelists is to come. 

The Shakespeare-Bacon controversy seems 
to have resolved itself into a struggle of 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



405 



M. P.'s. Sir Edwin Burning-Lawrence has 
died, so the Conservative benches at Westmin- 
ster are no longer graced by the intrepid 
scholar Avho found irrefutable proof of 
Bacon's authorship in the fact that one of 
" Shakespeare's " characters said something 
very like "hie, haec, hog," and in the still 
more staggering fact that the initial letters 
of three consecutive Shakespearean lines are 
P, I, G. But the remaining protagonists in 
the fight (at any rate as far as the English 
Front is concerned) are both Members of Par- 
liament. One is Mr. J. M. Robertson and the 
other Mr. George Greenwood. Mr. Robertson 
is one of the most energetic, versatile, and per- 
tinacious men in the United Kingdom; and, 
one is bound to add, one of the most acrimo- 
nious of our controversialists. He began pub- 
lic life as assistant to the late Charles Brad- 
laugh, the Colonel Ingersoll of Europe; and 
for many years he spent his whole time in the 
congenial atmosphere of hopeless minorities. 
He was a Socialist before Socialism became 
fashionable ; a Rationalist before Atheism be- 
came fashionable. He venomously attacked 
"Joe" Chamberlain at the height of that 
statesman's popularity; and the time which 
he could spare from politics and the fight for 
religious free-speech he employed in demon- 
strating to his own satisfaction, with all the 
apparatus of mythological research, that 
Jesus Christ was not merely not God but had 
never even existed. The most heterodox of 
us, however, has a w r eak spot somewhere : and 
the " soundness " of Mr. Robertson's opinions 
on literature is impeccable. As for the accu- 
racy of the ascription of Shakespeare's plays 
to the gentleman whom Sir Edwin Burning- 
Lawrence used invariably to denounce as "the 
drunken, illiterate clown of Stratford," Mr. 
Robertson is shocked, appalled, when anyone 
questions it. 

Mr. Robertson is grim. He devotes to lit- 
erature all the seriousness and industry that 
he used to devote to the rites of Osiris and 
Mithra and he was at the Board of Trade 
when holding office in the late Liberal Gov- 
ernment to the exports and imports of 
Tientsin and the Bahamas. Mr. Greenwood, 
on the other hand, is a cheerful soul. His 
chief political hobby has been a long cam- 
paign against "blood-sports" and the de- 
struction of wild-life, and he has even infused 
a certain vivaciousness into this. His line in 
the Shakespeare controversy is a wary one. 
He does not claim Bacon as the Swan (or 
shall we, with Sir Edwin, say the Hog?) of 
Avon. He does not know who wrote the plays. 
All he knows is that Shakespeare did not. 
Some years ago he formulated his views in 



a large volume, " The Shakespeare Problem 
Restated." To this Mr. Robertson replied in 
another large tome entitled (the expositor of 
a hundred heresies must have found a deli- 
cious savour in the name) " The Baconian 
Heresy." Mr. Greenwood has now counter- 
attacked in six hundred closely printed pages 
of a book which he calls "Is There a Shake- 
speare Problem?" "Let us hope there is," 
one feels inclined to say, aghast at the thought 
that all this laboring may have been totally 
superfluous. It is a readable, good-tempered, 
and sensible piece of argument. The author 
returns once more to the questions of Shake- 
speare's learning and his law, with the conclu- 
sion that he was a learned lawyer; he 
discusses his will, his handwriting, his name, 
his portraits, and his knowledge of " Nature," 
which he contends, with some force, to have 
been rather that of the gentleman who knows 
his hounds, hawks, and horses well and other 
birds and beasts not so well, than that of the 
person who stalks the blackbird and the but- 
tercup in their native haunts. It is all one to 
me. " I do n't care where the water goes if it 
does n't get into the wine," sings Mr. Chester- 
ton in one of his most earnest lyrics ; and for 
myself I don't care what the critics say if 
they leave the plays intact. But Mr. Green- 
wood's book, if you enjoy this perennial dis- 
pute at all, is well worth reading.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY is an educa- 
tional ideal, never to be fully realized outside 
of Utopia, although presenting itself as an 
inviting possibility in countries far less 
favored than that pattern republic. In the 
State of Illinois there has for four years been 
in preparation a plan for a greater measure 
of efficient self-government on the part of the 
State University; and a constitution with 
that end in view has finally been drafted by a 
committee of professors and other officers of 
that institution, and now awaits formal action 
from the proper authorities. In 107 clauses, 
filling seventeen octavo pages, this scheme of 
internal administration is carefully developed, 
with three additional pages of tentative sug- 
gestion, the whole prefaced by a, detailed 
" historical statement " from Professor Henry 
B. Ward, chairman of the committee. Among 
notable items in this Magna Charta from 
Urbana- Champaign, a document too long to 
be even summarized here, attention may be 
called to the following as of considerable sig-

stitution, copies of which, we infer, may be 
obtained on request. 



IMPLACABLE FOES TO FICTION have risen in 
their might, or in their impotence, in the city 
of New York, and are demanding that the 
public library shall cease to provide novels 
for the amusement of the people. This, at 
least, is the recommendation or suggestion of 
the head of the municipal Bureau of Statistics 
and Investigation, which of course is not actu- 
ated exclusively by a tender concern for 
public morals, but chiefly by a desire to effect 
economy in the city's finances; and the old 
cry against the frivolity if not the actual 
wickedness of novel-reading is raised in sup- 
port of the proposed measure. No disastrous, 
outcome from this agitation need be feared 
by New York novel-readers, since the enter- 
tainment-providing function of the public 
library is too generally recognized and ap- 
proved to be discontinued. But the incident 
arouses discussion and a rehearsal of the old 
arguments for and against the story-book and 
its right of admission to the people's library. 
More than sixty years ago George Ticknor, 
who was a member of the Boston Public 
Library's first Board of Trustees and was 



appointed one of a committee to draw up a 
plan for the proposed library, urged the 
desirability of providing a generous supply of 
copies of "the more respectable of the popu- 
lar books of the time," so that "many per- 
sons, if they desire it, can be reading the same 
work at the same moment." Wholesome fic- 
tion was evidently included by him in this 
class. The protest against "trashy novels," 
so often raised by those who think the library 
too liberal in its provision of fiction, is one 
that few library officials can listen to with 
patience ; for is it not the earnest endeavor of 
these officials to bar out the trashy novel? 
And are they not in general succeeding as 
well as the obvious difficulties of the problem 
will permit? On this head there appears a 
sane and well-informed utterance by Mr. 
Edmund Lester Pearson in the October issue 
of " Branch Library News," which he edits 
for the New York Public Library. He takes 
occasion to quote from a letter of Ticknor's to 
Edward Everett, in the same vein as the pas- 
sage cited above. Significant, too, are the 
statistics he gives of the circulation of stand- 
ard fiction, the recognized classics of romance. 
Despite the people's unwisdom in clamoring 
for the very latest fiction, regardless of qual- 
ity, the public library ought not to be and 
will not be forbidden to furnish what Ticknor 
called "the pleasant literature of the day." 


ENTERPRISE IN THE PUBLISHING BUSINESS 
has recently exhibited a new and thought- 
provoking development. The publisher of a 
juvenile series of books which, he boldly 
asserts, are " the most successful of their kind 
ever published," was approached last summer 
by a costume-maker in New York, for permis- 
sion to name a dress after the breezy young 
heroine of his best-sellers. The publisher, who 
presumably has not attained to his present 
measure of success without a sad realization 
of the relatively wide appeal that clothes 
make to the buying public, eagerly assented to 
the proposal of the costume-maker. Between 
them they worked out a plan whereby each 
purchaser of the costumer's dress should, in 
return for her own name and that of five 
friends, be entitled to receive a free copy of 
whatever book in the publisher's series she 
preferred. The names thus obtained are put 
upon the mailing list of both publisher and 
dressmaker, each of whom is carrying on an 
extensive campaign of advertising this sea- 
son. The manufacturer has a reasonable ex- 
pectation of selling ten thousand dresses, and 
this should ensure to the publisher at least 
twenty-five thousand new names, to which he 
is mailing special circulars. As a final coup 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



407 



the publisher has issued a circular to retail 
book-sellers, offering- a dress to each of the 
fifteen salespeople who dispose of the greatest 
number of the titles in his series during the 
rest of the year. Salesmen are not excluded 
from the contest; the suits they win will be 
fitted to their "wives or daughters." "We 
believe," concludes the circular, "that this is 
something entirely new in the book-selling 
business, but it promises to prove exceed- 
ingly popular." Without doubt, it will be 
popular. Our astute publisher has seen the 
main chance ; he has put books, which nobody 
buys except under stress, into connection with 
clothes, which are bought casually and lav- 
ishly by the average American woman. And 
it is our women who buy books, when they 

are bought at all. 



HALF A CENTURY OF LIBRARY SERVICE, and 
in fact rather more than that, is credited to 
the account of the lately deceased John Ed- 
mands, whose activity in his chosen profession 
began in 1846 at Yale College, where for a 
year he had charge of the library of the 
Society of Brothers in Unity, and where also 
from 1851 to 1856 he was assistant librarian 
of the college library. From 1856 to 1901 he 
guided the fortunes of the Mercantile Library 
in Philadelphia, being Librarian Emeritus at 
the time of his death. Significant of his 
bibliographic bent is the fact that in the very 
earliest months of his library service he pre- 
pared and published a small work that served 
as the germ of the later and much larger 
" Poole's Index." This was his list of " Sub- 
jects for Debate, with References to the 
Authorities." He also compiled bibliogra- 
phies of the " Letters of Junius " and of the 
"Dies Iras," drew up one of the first of the 
now somewhat numerous lists of historical 
prose fiction, devised a system of book-classifi- 
cation, and was a valued though not frequent 
contributor to periodical library literature. 
Memory recalls to the present writer the ven- 
erable figure of Mr. Edmands presiding over 
some of the earlier meetings of the association 
of Pennsylvania librarians formed by a group 
of Philadelphia library workers in the early 
nineties of the last century. He was the first 
president elected by that body, and his age 
and experience gave dignity and impressive- 
ness to its deliberations. A charter member 
also of the A. L. A., and one of its first vice- 
presidents, his name has long been familiar to 
the American library world. He furnished a 
conspicuous example of the sustaining power, 
physical and mental, of rather arduous intel- 
lectual pursuits continued considerably be- 
yond the scriptural threescore years and ten. 



THE SECRET OF SUCCESS IN MARTIAL VERSE IS 

not to be revealed in a dozen w r ords, nor yet 
in a hundred. Some glimmerings of the ele- 
ments of effectiveness in this variety of metri- 
cal composition may nevertheless be caught 
from an examination of the enduring exam- 
ples familiar to all the world. In no other 
form of poetry is the personal and the par- 
ticular, as contrasted with the general and 
the abstract, so sure of finding favor. "My 
Maryland " and the lines inspired by John 
Brown's tragic fate are no vague appeals to 
patriotism. Even the "Battle-Hymn of the 
Republic " begins with a possessive pronoun 
denoting the first person singular. An 
English writer (Mr. Arthur Waugh) on the 
subject of war poetry, in the current issue of 
the London "Book Monthly," lays emphasis 
on this quality of personal appeal, and goes 
so far as to say that " probably no single war- 
song ever exercised more influence in its time 
than Julia Ward Howe's republican .master- 
piece, and the appeal of that hymn will be 
found upon examination to be entirely per- 
sonal, embellished with a quantity of highly 
effective decoration which inflames the fancy 
without portraying actualities." Then he 
quotes the opening lines and calls attention to 
their personal touch combined with " pure 
though noble rhetoric." He continues: 
" There is great virtue in this ; indeed % it may 
be said to be the secret of the whole matter, 
so far as the achievement of war-poetry is 
concerned. The best war-songs are always 
those that speak straight to the individual. 
The best war-poetry is invariably subjective." 
It is true that lofty verse may be inspired by 
the general theme of armed strife, and it may 
be immeasurably finer poetiy than the favor- 
ite ballad of the camps and trenches; but the 
martial lays that live in the hearts and on the 
lips of men are of the less abstract quality 

indicated above. 



INDIA'S FIRST LIBRARY EXHIBITION was held 
recently at Mehsana, in the Kadi District of 
the State of Baroda ; and " The Library Mis- 
cellany" (product of the enterprise of Mr. 
B. M. Dadachanji, member of the A. L. A., 
now living in the city of Baroda) gives con- 
siderable space to a description of its notable 
features, with a view of the fine library build- 
ing that was the scene of the interesting event. 
Graphic representations of library progress 
in the Kadi District, with pictures bf noted 
foreign libraries, including many in America, 
greeted the eye of the visitor, who was further 
instructed and entertained by cinematograph 
and stereopticon views, all illustrative of li- 
brary activity. "Another specially noteworthy 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 11 



feature of the exhibition," we read, " was the 
children's room, specially organized. There 
in cases were attractively arranged typical 
children's books, such as ragbooks, picture 
books, artistically bound books, including the 
charming series of the Japanese fairy tales, 
as also various kinds of children's game- and 
puzzle-boxes." It was, too, with all its variety 
of interest, a rather impromptu exhibition, 
hurriedly prepared in honor of an unexpected 
visit from the Maharaja of Baroda, who seems 
to be an exceedingly popular as well as 
actively beneficent potentate. " The Library 
Miscellany" gives in each issue detailed and 
highly encouraging accounts of library prog- 
ress in its own and other districts of India, 
but its fortunes, like those of many another 
periodical,- seem to have been adversely 
affected by the war. At any rate the number 
now at hand is dated "January & April, 
1915." denoting a merging of two quarterly 
issues into one half-yearly number. Bein,g a 
tri-lingual magazine, its publication is neces- 
sarily a rather arduous undertaking. 



A PATHETIC APPEAL TO BOOK-BUYERS takes 

the form of a volume, lately published in 
London, entitled " The Blinded Soldiers' and 
Sailors' Gift Book," which the beneficiaries 
will never be able to read. All the profits 
from the sale of this volume are to be devoted 
to carrying on the work, inaugurated at " St. 
Dunstans," Regent's Park, of teaching the 
sightless unfortunates of the war such trades 
as will make them self-supporting in the 
future. Artists, poets, and prose-writers have 
liberally responded to the call to collaborate 
in the making of this gift book, and the con- 
tributors are said to include " most of the best 
names in literature and art." Many of the 
illustrations are products of the four-color 
process, and are of great beauty, if report is 
to be trusted. Queen Mary shows a most 
helpful interest in the work, which is also 
cordially received by less exalted purchasers. 
By issuing a very large edition the publishers, 
Messrs. Jarrold & Sons, have kept the price 
down to three shillings. It is to be hoped 
that the book will be on sale in America as 
well as in England. 



APHORISTIC WISDOM commends itself to us 
in inverse proportion to our need of it. Impa- 
tient and self-confident youth is prone to 
regard all maxims as the feeble-foolish maun- 
derings of doddering old age; while the 
hoary-headed sage, past the time for profiting 
by apophthegmatic counsels, prize these nug- 
gets of wisdom. The Chicago Public Library 
issues to all members of its staff a "Rule 



Book " for their guidance, and on the inside 
of its covers are printed pithy bits of advice 
like the following: "Do what you are paid 
for and then some ; it's the ' then some ' 
that gets your salary raised." "Folks that 
never do any more than they get paid for, 
never get paid for any more than they do." 
" Some men are ground down on the grind- 
stone of life, while others get polished up. It- 
depends on their kind of stuff." " You will 
never push yourself forward in this world by 
patting yourself on the back." " The man 
who thinks he can learn nothing thinks a 
great truth." One need not be a head librarian 
or even a library assistant in order to have 
the capacity to appreciate and perhaps to 
derive benefit from these " wise saws." 


A PRIZE COMPETITION FOR ESSAYISTS IS just 

announced, with the tidy sum of five thousand 
dollars as bait to lure the writers. The sub- 
ject of the prospective essays and the circum- 
stances attending the offer of the prizes are 
interesting, for more reasons than one. In 
brief, as reported in the daily press, Colonel 
Gustave Pabst of Milwaukee, newly elected 
president of the United States Brewers' Asso- 
ciation, made it known at the recent conven- 
tion of that body that the aforementioned 
sum of money was to be appropriated to 
stimulate literary and argumentative zeal in 
the treatment of the saloon problem. It will 
readily be believed that the presidential ad- 
dress was not lacking in eloquent tribute to 
Gambrinus, and a careful reading of that 
address might advantageously precede the 
competitor's effort to win one of the offered 
prizes; just as a cold disregard of its tenor 
might, and probably would, result in no 
pecuniary addition to the essayist's resources. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

MADAME TINAYEE'S WAR NOVEL. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Some months ago I contributed to this depart- 
ment of your journal a brief review of the novels 
of Madame Tinayre, in which I indicated the 
feminist trend in her work. She has recently 
issued a new book, " La Veillee des Armes," which 
should be of interest to your readers. On the 
cover we read " roman," but the dedication de- 
scribes the work more accurately as " a mirror in 
which are reflected the familiar and the heroic 
aspects of a Paris which will never be seen again." 
The centring of the action about a few characters 
merely serves to heighten the human interest and 
pathos of the narrative. The author adds that 
none of her books " owes less to imagination and 
depends less on literary artifice." We have, then, 
a poignant picture, or rather a photograph, of a 



1915 



THE DIAL

tiny corner of Paris, and never did a part better 
represent the whole, on July 31 and August 1, 
1914. Whoever had the privilege of being in the 
city at that time has witnessed all that Madame 
Tinayre relates, and the dramatic simplicity of her 
narrative will make the scenes live again even for 
those who did not witness them. As " a moment's 
monument," the book deserves a place with Sar- 
cey's " Siege de Paris." 

The scene is laid in a quiet little street on the 
left bank of the Seine, inhabited by the petite 
bourgeoisie. Its denizens are charming, and the 
reader follows with keen interest the varying emo- 
tions of each one. We meet first the keeper of a 
newspaper stand, who flatly refuses to give change 
for a fifty franc note. Every new comer is 
promptly suspected of wishing to procure a little 
precious gold or silver under pretext of paying for 
his paper with a bill. Customers devour and com- 
ment upon the latest news as they stand before 
the booth. A veteran of 1870 mutters, " Bon 
Dieu, must we go through that again? " A young 
man exclaims, as he spies two marauding cats, 
' There's some fresh meat for the siege ! " Work- 
men discuss eagerly the loyalty of their brothers 
across the Rhine to the Socialist cause; women, 
eager to lay by provisions for emergencies, com- 
plain of the crowds at the grocers', and of the 
greed of the dealers who have already raised 
prices. Marie Pourat arrives to get the papers 
for her patrons; she is a sturdy woman, slaving 
to give her two children a better chance in life 
than she has had. Though not given to gossip, for 
once as she performs her duties she relates the 
rumors of the morning to her late-rising employ- 
ers. A German firm was hidden behind the 
" Maggi " milk depots, and a plot to poison 
Paris had been discovered. Already crowds were 
smashing the windows of these unhappy dairies. 
Germans had been arrested trying to cross the 
frontier with enormous sums of gold. Marie goes 
iirst to the studio of M. Frechette, an artist who 
cohabits scandalously with his models and is so 
sympathetic for all that! At the first glance over 
the paper he cries : " Hurrah ! now we'll escort 
the cubists [e. g. the Munich artists] to the fron- 
tier! " Marie carries the paper to Simone Daves- 
nes, the heroine of the story, in so far as there 
is one. Her youth had been pinched and sad ; but 
two years before the scene opens, she had mar- 
ried a lieutenant, now an engineer in an aviation 
factory. Fleeting glimpses of their idyllic happi- 
ness are offered the reader. From the first, Fran- 
cois Davesnes has been convinced that Germany 
wishes war. He says calmly that France will 
know how to accept it when it comes. From day 
to day his wife watches him become again what he 
has never ceased to be a soldier; and she cannot 
entirely repress her sadness. The following bit of 
dialogue may be cited, as it rang from one end of 
France to another in those terrible days: 

" ' Then you must love me as one should love a 
soldier without weakness.' 

" ' I will try, Francois. . . ' 

" ' You must be calm, wait, hope, accept destiny. . . 
I shall only be truly strong if I feel you strong behind 
me. Until evening, dearest.' " 



| And so the story goes on, the same simplicity 
obtaining throughout. The men conceal their emo- 
tion under a stoic mask or with a jest, while the 
women try to love them as soldiers should be 
loved, that they may be truly strong. Here is no 
literary artifice; it is photographic truth. 

Interesting are the recurring scenes which show 
the French people, torn asunder on the very eve 
of the conflict by the scandal of the Caillaux case, 
rapidly welding together under the foreign menace. 
We see the police grow paternal, the Socialist 
laborers salute their superiors as they leave the 
work-shops, while one phrase rings through all 
classes : " On ne pent pas devenir Prussiens! " 

The spirit of coolness in which the book is 
written is striking. Though all the characters are 
convinced that Germany wished the war, there is 
no expression of hatred for the enemy. The same 
was true of the Paris of last August. Perhaps the 
moment was too solemn for violent outbursts of 
feeling; but no small credit is due to this author 
for having observed truth to the reality. The spirit 
of " the new Germany " is judged as follows : 

" They are modern Germans. They dream only of 
material power, wealth, domination. They despise all 
that is not German, I have felt in them this strange 
mysticism, this cult of force, almost lyrie in its ex- 
pression, which has become the mental malady, the 
megalomania with which all their race is afflicted." 

In my previous review, I presented Madame 
Tinayre as a perhaps over-ardent champion of 
feminism. I confess that on first seeing her new 
book, I feared to find something like the spirit of 
the recent play, " War Brides." No such matter. 
The fact that the lot of the women who stay 
behind is more bitter than that of the men who 
fight is fully appreciated. The women feel a keen 
sense of wrong, all that the heroine of " War 
Brides " felt, as is shown by the following out- 
cry from a porter's wife: 

" ' It's heart-breaking. We aren't cowards ; but 
when we have borne a child and suckled and reared 
him to manhood by our toil, and then they say to us: 
" Now give him up, to be killed perhaps, and you will 
remain alone in your old age, you will have nothing 
. . . ," that breaks the heart . . . it's worse than 
death ... Ah! ~bon Dieu Seignerur! If there were 
women in the government, it would be over, all this 
warring! Soldiers fight the battles, but women bear 
the soldiers. . . Between us, we'd always come to an 
agreement to save our children. I can't believe that 
German mothers' hearts are different from mine . . '" 

But in the final hour, la patrie en danger in- 
spires an idealism of sacrifice, each one his part; 
and, as the author says in her dedication, " the 
weakest among us felt throbbing in his mortal 
heart the eternal heart of France."

A SOUTHERN TRIBUTE TO A NEGRO. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
There has been gross mistreatment of the negro 
in the South. Of this fact we are often and 
vehemently reminded. There has also been recog- 
nition, friendship. Of this fact, though more 
pleasant, we hear less. The kindlier relationship, 



410 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 11 



to be sure, has not gone wholly unproclaimed. 
White men in the South cannot cease to be grate- 
ful to Booker T. Washington for reminding North- 
ern audiences that where a Southern negro has 
succeeded, in nine cases out of ten it is through the 
encouragement, goodwill, and financial assistance 
of some white neighbor. We should not ignore, 
as Mr. Washington does not ignore, the wrongs, 
the grave problems ; but surely we should not close 
our eyes either to the understanding and cordial 
cooperation which so often exists between the two 
races. 

I subjoin a tribute to a negro which appeared 
editorially in the Lynchburg " News " on October 
10. It is the more appropriate to your columns 
because the negro whose virtues are celebrated has 
long been a living force in one of the oldest of 
Southern educational institutions. To my knowl- 
edge the editorial has been read by housekeepers 
here in Lexington to their colored servants as an 
inspiration and a reminder that negro merits are 
perceived and acknowledged.

THE PASSING OF HENRY MARTIN. 

Henry Martin, for more than half a century the 
colored janitor of the University of Virginia, has 
ceased to walk the rounds of his daily duty; sur- 
rendered his keys; abandoned all temporal responsi- 
bilities and his place in the ranks of the living will 
know him no more. The man was widely known 
his passing will be widely noted with regret. You 
remember him. Mr. Alumnus; you and your con- 
temporaries. President Wilson used to know him; 
so did Attorney General Gregory; and Secretary 
MeAdoo, and Supreme Court Justice McReynolds, as 
did Mr. Underwood and Senator Martin, and Thomas 
Nelson Page but why go on? The roll is all too 
long, which embraces those of high or mediocre sta- 
tion in the current affairs of human life who knew 
Henry Martin, and in knowing, honored him. How 
easily he can be summoned to the chamber of our 
memories, and there be visualized as we used to see. 
him a striking and pleasing figure of a man. Tall, 
erect, kindly visaged, with a nameless sort of ease 
and courtliness of carriage, which served an admira- 
ble setting for a noble soul that was Henry Martin. 
We need no photograph to aid in the delineation. 

It may be truthfully said of " Uncle Henry," as he 
used to be affectionately called, that in high degree 
he exemplified the attributes of fidelity, courtesy and 
the sort of dignity which is as easily, instantly recog- 
nized as it is certain to command the tribute of high 
respect. He was naturally, unostentatiously the gen- 
tleman always. He was very true to his trust 
faithful in the performance of duty; gentle of heart 
and yet equipped with an unassuming force of per- 
sonality that made distinct impression upon all with 
whom he came in contact. Besides, Henry Martin 
was a man of upright life; clean of character; 
scrupulous and vigilant in observing all polite ameni- 
ties. And so as he passed from one period of service 
to another, he grew into a sort of influence in the 
University's life, which was of good import. We dare 
say that of all the many thousands of students who 
knew him, there was not one who did not see in 
Henry Martin something to respect something in 
his manner, bearing, or in the outward manifestation 
of his heart to merit the unaffected esteem of others, 
regardless of their color. 



It is good to know that Uncle Henry lived to a 
ripe old age; that he discharged well and conscien- 
tiously all that was given him to do, and that in 
passing, he yet dies not in the kindly regard of Vir- 
ginia's alumni who are now scattered throughout the 
United States. Even, Mr. Alumnus, as he used to 
tip his hat to you and me as we passed him on the 
old walks or under the old arcades of the University, 
so may we both now salute his memory with uncov- 
ered head this and besides this the throb of 
sadness in the heart. 



HAWTHORNE'S SHORT STORIES IN JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I have read with great pleasure and profit the 
article by Mr. Charles Leonard Moore on " The 
Best Short Stories " in your issue for Sept. 2 
last. Of course, the selection made in such a case 
will depend, to some extent, upon the individual 
taste; it would be quite difficult to eliminate 
entirely the subjective element in such a critical 
choice of " the best." And yet the general " rules 
for guidance" in such a choice, as suggested by 
Mr. Moore, are those which one would not over- 
rule. But I wish to raise a query concerning the 
application of one of those rules. 

I refer to the mention of Hawthorne, whose 
short stories are all rejected on the ground that 
" they have been stopped at the frontiers of other 
countries," and thus lack " a certain universality," 
which is the requisite of the second rule. 

Now, I beg to submit that Hawthorne's short 
stories have not all been stopped at the frontiers 
of Japan. If " The Miraculous Pitcher " is out 
of this court, because it is not exactly original but 
rather a kind of translation, " The Great Stone 
Face " is certainly original, and it has crossed the 
boundaries of Japan. I do not mean merely that 
it has been translated into Japanese; I mean that 
it has proved " capable of general acceptation " in 
Japan by the Japanese and that it is somewhat 
popular here. This may be partly due to the fact 
that there is a counterpart in an old Japanese 
fairy-tale called " The Matsuyama Mirror." And 
yet the latter is not well known to Japanese 
youth, who never fail to appreciate " The Great 
Stone Face." Anyhow, Hawthorne's great short 
story has become a naturalized citizen in the 
Japanese school world. " David Swan " and " The 
Ambitious Guest " are also popular here. 

I write this not to dispute Mr. Moore's general 
rules or even their special applications, but only 
to point out that one application (to Hawthorne) 
does not apply in the case of Japan. And I write 
this after several years of experience in using 
" Twice-Told Tales " as a text-book in English. 

Since writing the above, I have made inquiries 
of some of my Japanese colleagues, who are teach- 
ers of English, and find that I am supported, not 
only in my general contention, but even in my 
specific choice of stories. And one of them added 
that he liked " David Swan " because it has " a 
Japanese tone." For an Occidental story to have 
an Oriental tone is a good proof of its univer- 
sality- ERNEST W. CLEMENT.

THE DIPLOMAT OF THE GOLJXEX RULE.* 

Few men of note in American life have | 
worked their way more deeply into the hearts j 
of their intimate associates than John Hay. ! 
When he chose to give of his personal affec- 
tion at all, he gave unstintingly and received i 
unstintingly in return. This innate tendency ; 
was doubtless powerfully developed by the 
fact that when hardly more than a boy he 
came under the influence of the most intimate 
daily association with the strong and tender 
nature of President Lincoln. And it was one j 
of his most lovable traits that the boy in him 
never died. The fresh, breezy jest, full of | 
youthful spirit, -keeps breaking out even dur- 
ing the closing year, after he had written the 
lines, 
" At eve. when the dull wintry day is sped, 

I muse beside my fire's faint-flickering glare 
Conscious of wrinkling face and whitening 

hair 

Of those who, dying young, inherited 
The immortal youthfulness of the early dead." 

It was only a year earlier than this that he 
had given to the Ohio Society in New York 
the following humorous description of his 
origins : 

" If I am not that altogether deplorable crea- 
ture, a man without a country, I am, when it comes 
to pull and prestige, almost equally bereft, as I am 
a man without a State. I was born in Indiana, I 
grew up in Illinois, I was educated in Rhode 
Island, and it is no blame to that scholarly com- 
munity that I know so little. I learned my law 
in Springfield and my politics in Washington, my 
diplomacy in Europe, Asia and Africa. I have a 
farm in New Hampshire and desk-room in the 
District of Columbia. When I look to the springs 
from which my blood descends, the first ancestors 
I ever heard of were a Scotch man, who was half 
English, and a German woman, who was half 
French. Of my immediate progenitors, my mother 
was from New England and my father was from 
the South. In this bewilderment of origin and 
experience, I can only put on an aspect of deep 
humility in any gathering of favorite sons, and 
confess that I am nothing but an American." 

With his college course at Brown, sur- 
rounded by men and women of culture and 
refinement, Hay imbibed an ardent apprecia- 
tion of the things of the mind, and developed 
an ambition for a literary career. But hin- 
drances came, which he chose, perhaps un- 
necessarily, to regard as decisive, and his 
cultivation of the muses was never more than

desultory. Edmund Clarence Stedman took 
him to task for desertion, thirty years ago. 
" Such poetry as the blank- verse impromptu 
on Liberty shows the higher worth of a man 
who should rise above indifference, and the 
hindrance of his mood, and in these spiritless 
times take up the lyre again, nor fitfully 
touch the strings." This insinuation that it 
was lack of will power which kept Hay out of 
a great literary career was seconded, after his 
death, by Mr. Howells, who expressed the 
opinion that in the literary work which he did 
do " he avouched his ability to have done what 
he wished in literature if only he had wished 
it enough." That the mood and not the want 
of inborn ability was at fault in his failure to 
place his name among the very highest on the 
roll of American poets will probably be the 
final judgment in the case. But whether the 
country could well have spared him to the 
muses is another question, which will be more 
easily answered when the lapse of years shall 
have shown whether certain high ideals which 
he sought to engraft upon diplomacy have 
effected a connection vital enough to stand 
the douche of Prussic acid to which interna- 
tional relations are now being subjected. 

With no definite prospects which seemed to 
justify the devotion of his talents to letters, 
Hay turned to the law and entered the office 
of his uncle, Milton Hay, of Springfield, Illi- 
nois. Here he soon met Abraham Lincoln, 
who had recently gained fame throughout the 
land by his debate with Douglas. Two years 
later, Lincoln was in the White House and 
Hay had begun his preparation for a states- 
man's career by taking service as assistant to 
John G. Nicolay, the President's private secre- 
tary. During the four momentous years that 
followed, he was employed on many a delicate 
enterprise, such as feeling out the possibility 
of setting up loyal state governments in the 
South, or slipping across the river from 
Niagara and meeting informally the alleged 
agents of the Confederacy through whom 
Greeley was making his famous and fatuous 
effort of the summer of 1864 to put an end to 
the war. The contribution of Lincoln's great 
spirit to the impressionable mind and heart 
of Hay was of course immeasurable, but Mr. 
Thayer's pages give ample evidence that the 
young Secretary, humble though his position 
was, made no insignificant contribution to the 
success of the most vitally important admin- 
istration ever seated in Washington'. 

After Lincoln's death, Hay went to Paris as 
Secretary of Legation, carrying from Thur- 
low Weed a letter to John Bigelow, American 
Minister, recommending him as " a bright, 
gifted young man, with agreeable manners 



412 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 11 



and refined tastes." Weed doubtless saw in 
the appointment only the taking care of a 
young man who had been Lincoln's secretary. 
In Paris, Hay drank in disgust for the petty- 
spirited despotism of Napoleon III., found 
food for moral reflection in 

" The tremulous shafts of dawning 
As they shoot o'er the Tuileries early," 

wormed his way into the intricacies of Papal 
politics through conversation with the Rever- 
end Professor of Dogmatic Theology in the 
Propaganda Fide College at Rome, learned 
the running gear of Imperial diplomatic func- 
tions, tasted of the higher artistic and intel- 
lectual life of the incomparable French capital, 
and then came home in 1867. all the better 
American for this varied and broadening ex- 
perience. John A. Dix had succeeded Bige- 
low as Minister, and wished, as a politician, 
to have a secretary of his own choice rather 
than to retain one already trained to the du- 
ties of the position. Hay went to Washington, 
willing to receive another position, though 
instinctively unwilling to press his claims by 
the wire-pulling methods of which he had seen 
so much during his service with Lincoln. At 
Washington he was invited to dine with Sum- 
ner, who discussed the Tenure of Office bill, 
then under consideration in the Senate. Sum- 
ner severely criticized Senator Sherman for 
opposing the inclusion of members of the 
Cabinet under the provisions of the bill, but 
Hay was not blinded to fundamental truths 
by the passions of the moment, as is shown by 
an entry made in his diary the same evening : 

" In all this ingenious and really clever and 
learned talk of Sumner's, I could but remark the 
blindness of an honest, earnest man, who is so 
intent upon what he thinks right and necessary 
that he closes his eyes to the fatal consequences of 
such a course in different circumstances and dif- 
ferent times. The Senate is now a bulwark against 
the evil schemes of the President; therefore he 
would give the Senate a power which might make 
it the most detestable engine of anarchy or oppres- 
sion." 

Sumner was opposing the confirmation of 
Dix as Minister to France; and if he had 
succeeded, Hay was to have been sent to Paris 
as Charge d'Affaires. But the friends of Dix 
won the battle, and Hay returned to his Indi- 
ana home, without money and with no suita- 
ble occupation yet in sight. He and Nicolay 
were already planning a biography of Lincoln, 
but with no encouragement from publishers. 
"Nobody is keen for our book," he reported 
to Nicolay. "We will have to write it and 
publish on our own hook some day, when we 
can afford." Within a few weeks, however, 
he was appointed as Secretary of Legation, to 



act as Charge d'Affaires, at Vienna, the post 
from which Motley had been driven through 
a piece of that brutal political bungling all 
too characteristic of our diplomacy. On his 
way to his new position he met Motley in 
London, still chafing bitterly over the injus- 
tice and rudeness of his recall, and tried to 
persuade him that the incident indicated no 
hostility on the part of Secretary Seward. 
though he admitted that Seward's letter of 
recall was " a frightful one for a gentleman 
to write or to receive." Hay's own career was 
never to reveal such dulness of perception in 
matters of the kind. Public life could not kill 
in him the essential qualities of the gentleman. 

Vienna gave him still more of the training 
and culture which he had absorbed at Paris. 
And he acquired there, too, a reasoned hatred 
for militarism. " The great calamity and 
danger of Europe today," he wrote to Sew- 
ard, "are these enormous armaments. No 
honest statesman can say that he sees in the 
present attitude of politics the necessity of 
war. No great power is threatened. There 
is no menace to peace that could not be imme- 
diately dispelled by a firm protest of the 
peacefully disposed majority of nations. 
There would be, therefore, no danger to any 
people, but a vast and immediate gain to all 
from a general disarmament. . . Why then is 
this awful waste of youth and treasure con- 
tinued? I believe from no other motive than 
to sustain the waning prestige of Kings." In 
the Europe about him he thought that he saw 
many germs of progress toward a greater 
human freedom. England had come abreast 
of John Bright, while Austria was governed 
by Forty-Eighters. The spirit of freedom 
which Bismarck had suckled with the blood 
of Sadowa was rising up to appal him : while 
France, still in a comatose slumber, was talk- 
ing in her sleep and murmuring the Marseil- 
laise. "And God has made her ruler blind 
drunk, that his Helot antics may disgust the 
world with despotism. If ever in my green 
and salad days I sometimes vaguely doubted. 
I am safe now. I am a Republican till I die. 
When we get to Heaven we can try a monar- 
chy, perhaps." 

In the autumn of 1868, Hay resigned and 
returned to America, but the following sum- 
mer found him again in diplomatic harness, 
as Secretary of Legation at Madrid. Here he 
remained for a year, and in addition to his 
secretarial duties gained that intimate knowl- 
edge of Spain and her people which he was 
later to give to the world in " Castilian Days.'' 
Castelar. then in his prime as the eloquent 
advocate of Republicanism, won his especial 
admiration. A chance visit to the office of the

New York " Tribune," as he passed through 
the city on his way home, and the chance 
writing of an able editorial comment on a 
cable dispatch which happened to arrive just 
at the time, chanced to please Greeley so 
highly that Hay was at once invited to join 
the staff of the paper. The offer was accepted, 
and Hay's status was fixed for the next five 
years. He then resigned and went to Cleve- 
land, partly because the strain of newspaper 
work was undermining his health, and partly 
in accordance with the desire of Amasa Stone, 
the founder of Adelbert College, whose daugh- 
ter lie had married in 1874. 

In 1871 " Castilian Days " and the " Pike 
County Ballads and Other Pieces" had been 
published by Osgood. Hay himself was sin- 
cere in placing very little value upon that 
part of his verse which won immediate popu- 
larity, and one may trust his judgment rather 
than that of Mr. Howells, who has said that 
the "Pike County Ballads" would as infal- 
libly carry his fame as the " Biglow Papers " 
carry Lowell's. Only a year before his death, 
" Castilian Days " was to figure as the basis 
of an impudent demand from some extremists 
that he be expelled from the Cabinet, because 
of certain strictures against the Spanish Cath- 
olic Church. During the World's Fair at 
Chicago someone with intentions superior to 
his information introduced him to the Span- 
ish Princess Eulalia and her companions as 
the author of a book on Spain which they 
really ought to read, "unconscious," Hay 
wrote to Henry Adams, "that my unhappy 
little volume treats the august family of 
Spain as a set of pas grandes choses from 
Wayback, who have no place outside of penal 
and reformatory institutions." This, by the 
way, is a good illustration of Hay's character- 
istic freedom of expression in private corre- 
spondence, which he, as many other great men, 
was wont to employ as a kind of offset to the 
dignity imposed by a keen sense of fitness in 
public utterances. 

After leaving the " Tribune," Hay began in 
earnest his long labor on the Lincoln biog- 
raphy, which was finally published in 1890. 
In the meanwhile, he had written " The 
Bread- Winners," stimulated by reflection on 
the railroad riots of 1877, but published 
anonymously and never formally acknowl- 
edged. In 1879, Secretary Evarts asked him 
to become Assistant Secretary of State, and 
he held the position until the opening of the 
Garfield administration. It is a poor com- 
ment on the management of our diplomacy 
that from Lincoln to McKinley a man of 
Hay's qualities was used only to fill occasional 
gaps of short duration. Thrown out with the 



passing of Evarts, he served for six months 
as editor-in-chief of the " Tribune," while 
Whitelaw Reid was touring Europe on his 
honeymoon. His editorial ability and judg- 
ment were severely but successfully tested in 
dealing with the crisis in New York politics 
caused by the break between the New York 
Senators and the administration, and the 
subsequent assassination of the President. 

In the early eighties, Hay left Cleveland 
and built a fine home in Washington, by the 
side of that of his most intimate friend, 
Henry Adams, both structures being designed 
by Henry H. Richardson, foremost of Amer- 
ican architects. Mr. Thayer gives a charm- 
ing picture of the social and intellectual life 
that centred in these two homes. Hay's 
appointment to diplomatic service was sug- 
gested to President Harrison, who only made 
the foolish answer, " There is n't any politics 
in it." And so the fated diplomatic career 
had to await the coming of McKinley, who 
was too deeply indebted to Hay's kindness to 
have passed him by on any mere balancing of 
political values. We may well believe, how- 
ever, that Hay would have received the Lon- 
don Embassy on the score of his conspicuous 
fitness, even if McKinley's rise to the Presi- 
dency had not involved certain incidents 
which many would gladly forget, but which 
Mr. Thayer chooses to set forth with no dis- 
guise of their inherent unpleasantness, doubt- 
less that the unvarnished truth may show 
Hay's kindness to McKinley to have had no 
ulterior motive. Nor does Mr. Thayer's nar- 
rative conceal the fact that the same cannot 
be said of the aid rendered to McKinley by 
the Ohio Republican boss of the period. 

One does not need to dwell on the details 
of Hay's service in the London Embassy. A 
sentence from a letter to Senator Lodge, writ- 
ten after the outbreak of the war with Spain, 
gives the keynote of his policy : " It is hardly 
too much to say that the interests of civiliza- 
tion are bound up in the direction the rela- 
tions of England and America are to take in 
the next few months." In Mr. Thayer's 
words, "He realized that on the welding to- 
gether of England and the United States, the 
future welfare of two hemispheres depended." 
Meanwhile, John Sherman, broken under the 
burden of the State Department, into which 
the Ohio Republican boss had forced him in 
order to clear his own path to the Senate, had 
surrendered his portfolio to Judge Day. 
Three months later. Day resigned, to take 
service on the Paris Commission which was 
to conclude peace with Spain. The President 
immediately tendered to Hay by cable the 
office of Secretarv of State. He took his desk

on the first of October, 1898, and remained 
there, absorbed head and heart in far-reaching 
labors for his country's good and the good of 
humanity, until he sank in the harness from 
exhaustion, in the spring of 1905. A journey 
to Bad Nauheim did no good, and he came 
back to his own country, to die in his New 
Hampshire summer home, on the first of July. 

In the Department of State, it is fair to 
say that he alone turned the tide which for a 
time threatened to precipitate a mad struggle 
for the partition of China among the great 
powers. Of our dealings with the Boxer trou- 
bles he wrote to Henry Adams : "At least we 
are spared the infamy of an alliance with 
Germany. I would rather, I think, be the 
dupe of China than the chum of the Kaiser." 
He saw clearly that England was for a time 
deceived by Germany in the Boxer matter; 
and if later, in 1905, he worked in apparent 
harmony with Germany in maintaining the 
integrity of China, it was only because Ger- 
many had been forced by circumstances to his 
position. It was characteristic of Hohenzol- 
lern diplomatic methods that the Kaiser and 
von Billow tried to persuade Hay that the 
other European powers were all in a con- 
spiracy, headed by France, to break down his 
policy. Hay sent out his famous " self-deny- 
ing circular," asking the other powers to join 
in a policy of respect for the integrity of 
China; and the prompt and satisfactory re- 
plies, he writes in his diary, " show clearly the 
extent of the Kaiser's illusion." But the 
Kaiser, as was soon disclosed, had merely been 
planting his mines for the humiliation of 
France; and the forced resignation of Del- 
casse, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
was signalled on the same day by making a 
Prince of von Billow, whom Hay once char- 
acterized as having made German diplomacy 
" as brutal as possible." 

In the matter of upholding the Monroe 
Doctrine against the desire of European 
powers to collect claims from Venezuela by 
force, as well as in the establishment and 
recognition of the Republic of Panama, Presi- 
dent Roosevelt assumed responsibility and 
Secretary Hay was not directly concerned in 
the negotiations. In the Venezuela matter 
the real antagonist was Germany, though she 
had inveigled England into temporary and 
not very resolute partnership. Mr. Roose- 
velt's threat to Dr. Holleben, German Ambas- 
sador, to send Dewey to Venezuela with the 
American squadron unless Germany should 
agree at once to arbitrate her claims, brought 
the desired answer. In the Panama matter, 
Mr. Thayer devotes a chapter to the task of 
proving that President Roosevelt's course was 



justifiable and honorable ; but he is careful to 
indicate that Hay was not even informed as 
to a good deal that was going on, and he 
leaves ample ground to those who prefer to 
believe that if Hay himself had been in charge 
methods would have been very different. 
That Hay never criticized that or any other 
official act of Mr. Roosevelt's was only in har- 
mony with his unbroken characteristic of 
entire devotion to any administration under 
which he served. Hay was a believer in peace 
and the things that make for peace, and if he 
could have had things entirely his own way 
the chances would have been good that the 
whole Panama matter would have been so 
handled as to make the canal a more powerful 
factor in promoting world peace than it may 
perhaps become, with the Panama "revolu- 
tion " attached to its record and its banks 
bristling with fortifications. When Hay was 
negotiating with England for a canal treaty 
he had said: "The fact is that no govern- 
ment not absolutely imbecile would ever think 
of fortifying the canal"; but he was over- 
borne in the end. 

But we must trespass no farther upon the 
reasonable limits of space. Mr. Thayer has 
given us a remarkable book on a man to whom 
all will concede unusual poAver, even those 
who cannot follow Mr. Howells in ranking 
him as the ablest statesman of his time. As 
if to prove that he was not more than human, 
there were points which his usual breadth of 
mind and sympathy did not cover. As late as 
1885 he could write to Nicolay : " Gilder was 
evidently horrified at your saying that Lee 
ought to be shot: a simple truth of law and 
equity. I find, after a careful reading of a 
dozen biographies and all his own reports, 
that Stonewall Jackson was a howling crank." 
Fortunately he realized, and added, that it 
would be folly for him to say so, in the 
Lincoln biography. In spite of his personal 
affection for Henry Adams, he never got 
above an instinctive prejudice that no Demo- 
crat could really be fit for a responsible gov- 
ernment position. It is only fair to add. 
however, that his experience with the Senate 
in trying to secure the ratification of arbitra- 
tion treaties convinced him that many promi- 
nent Republicans were in the same boat. "A 
treaty going into the Senate," he wrote, "is 
like a bull going into the arena : no one can 
say just how or when the final blow will fall, 
but one thing is certain it will never leave 
the arena alive." His deep personal affection 
for McKinley led him to an estimate of 
McKinley's abilities and services far higher 
than many who were not his enemies or oppo- 
nents would now be disposed to allow. And 



1915]

his attitude toward Mr. Roosevelt was much 
the same. Perhaps the nearest he ever came 
to a really damaging criticism of Mr. Roose- 
velt lies in the suggestion which one might 
find in a diary entry concerning a luncheon 
at the White House at which Hay himself, 
Yves Guyot, and Mr. Theodore Stanton were 
the guests : " The President talked with great 
energy and perfect ease the most curious 
French I ever listened to. It was absolutely 
lawless as to Grammar and occasionally bank- 
rupt in substantives ; but he had not the least 
difficulty in making himself understood, and 
one subject did not worry him more than 
another." Which is calculated to make the 
gray-haired reader green with envy of the 
younger generation, which may live until time 
shall unseal even the most intimate of the 
private diary entries which the career of the 
Rough-Rider has doubtless inspired.

THE NEW DKAMA IN ENGLISH.* 



It would seem the irony of fate that while 
literary discussion in this country has recently 
centred around the drama, it is our poets and 
not our playwrights who have pleasantly sur- 
prised us by finding themselves. Can it be 
that the movement for a better stage has suf- 
fered from self-consciousness? At any rate, 
to neither its workers nor its patrons have 
most of the prophetic utterances about it 
proved of practical value. To these utter- 
ances. Professor Dickinson's " The Case of 
American Drama " presents a wholesome con- 
trast. It is a sober and thoughtful analysis 
of the underlying problems of our contempo- 
rary theatre, such, for example, as the ten- 
dency toward centralization, which, while 
increasing the financial returns for manager, 
author, and actor alike, has resulted in disas- 
ter for the art that is in the last analysis also 
the life of the stage. Unlike most writers on 
the subject, the author does not attack the syn- 
dicate system of theatre management in itself, 
finding it on the whole " a necessary outgrowth 
of the spirit and methods of the time." It is 
the entrance into this system of " the theory 
of monopoly and absentee managerial con- 
trol" which he deplores, and the consequent 
organization of " the entire country as tribu- 
tary to one city." Working on this basis, he 
points out that the system has not only alien- 
ated the audience for good plays, caused the

art of acting to decline, and "perverted the 
springs of playmaking," but it has in so doing 
proceeded to defeat its own end of financial 
success. Its unfortunate effect on the pro- 
vincial theatres is well known. But the chief 
set-back, as Professor Dickinson shows, has 
come from the dramatists who have registered 
the artificiality and the futility of the 
system by their failure to provide the neces- 
sary plays. 

For all these ills, the author proposes no 
panacea, nor does he admit that a panacea is 
needed. Yet his criticism is not entirely de- 
structive. He believes that forces are already 
at work that can be depended on for the ulti- 
mate solution of the main problems. On the 
business side, the more efficient and less cen- 
tralized management of the "movies" and 
vaudeville is teaching its lesson to the heads of 
the theatre "trusts." Sporadic repertory 
theatres and independent producing societies 
are doing much to encourage both actors and 
authors ; while the growing tendency to read 
and study plays, and the reviving interest in 
out-of-door theatricals and pageants, are edu- 
cating popular taste. It is accordingly on the 
leavening possibilities of these forces rather 
than on the influence of any individual or 
group of individuals that Professor Dickinson 
rests his case for the American drama. Thus 
our stage is to work out its own salvation, 
and eventually we are to arrive at the form of 
repertory theatre best adapted to our national 
temper and traditions. Just what this form 
will be, the author does not undertake to say. 
He does, however, show clearly and concisely 
what we have to build on in the experience of 
the short-lived New Theatre of New York and 
that of the typical repertory theatres of 
France and Germany. For the completeness 
of the picture, and also because it touches 
more nearly our own problems, some account 
of the recent renaissance of the repertory 
theatre in England might well have been in- 
cluded here. 

It is proof of the emphasis that the author 
desires to lay on the significance of the open- 
air play and pageant that he treats these 
from the practical as well as from the theo- 
retical side. And the general reader will per- 
haps find his chapters on the construction of 
the theatre in the open and on the production 
of pageants both happily free from techni- 
cal terms among the freshest and most 
stimulating of the book. 

The lack of an index, or at least a detailed 
table of contents, will be felt by those who 
wish to use the volume for reference, particu- 
larly as the reasons for the arrangement of 
the material are not always apparent. And

here and there, an unqualified statement in- 
vites challenge. Such is the assertion with 
regard to the ancient Greek theatre that "it 
was really of little importance that the audi- 
ence was seated in the open," and " in every 
essential respect the performance might as 
well have taken place behind closed doors." 
Yet, in the main, the book is distinguished for 
its sound sense, its thorough understanding, 
and its vigorous presentation of the status quo 
of American drama. 

For the practical guidance of the many who 
by reading plays are, as Professor Dickinson 
suggests, making straight the way for our 
stage, Mr. Clark's "British and American 
Drama of To-day" is designed. Its advan- 
tages as a play-reader's or a play-goer's hand- 
book must be obvious at a glance. Here may 
be found brief biographies of the foremost 
modern writers of drama in English, with a 
concise statement of the consensus of opinion 
regarding their chief works, chronological 
lists of stage productions, and bibliographies 
that include even articles in the magazines. 
For definitive studies of the dramatists men- 
tioned, the reader must still go elsewhere. 
Indeed, the benefit he derives from the book 
will depend largely upon the background of 
knowledge he brings to it, and the use he 
makes of the excellent bibliographies. In cer- 
tain cases these should have been made still 
fuller by the inclusion of works in other lan- 
guages than English. To the list of criticisms 
of Bernard Shaw, for example, might well 
have been added such works as those by Cestre 
and Hamon in French and by Julius Bab in 
German. Some mention, also, of the Conti- 
nental productions of Shaw's plays was to be 
expected, especially in view of their remark- 
able popularity on the German stage. 

Mr. Clark shows a wide acquaintance with 
modern plays of all nations, and his facility 
of reference is well-nigh bewildering. Never- 
theless, in several instances he allows himself 
to be betrayed into hasty generalizations. 
Many will be quite unable to subscribe to such 
a dictum regarding contemporary American 
drama as this : " The dialogue is usually good, 
idiomatic, and clever " ; or to this astonishing 
statement : " The only criticism to be made 
against such plays as ' On Trial ' is that their 
very novelty is soon outworn, and that it is 
above all useless." Indeed, throughout his 
book Mr. Clark puts a far more favorable con- 
struction on what our dramatists have already 
achieved than does Professor Dickinson or 
than the facts of the case would seem to war- 
rant. Of this the American reader will fortu- 
nately be able to judge for himself. It should 
be stated that even though such a reader may 



not agree with the general conclusions, he will 
find Mr. Clark's exposition of the stagecraft of 
dramatists like Augustus Thomas and Clyde 
Fitch instructive. Yet it is chiefly for its sug- 
gestive reading lists, and its body of informa- 
tion, conveniently arranged and indexed for 
purposes of reference, that the volume may be 
recommended. MoArBE> 



CASSANDRA-VOICES OF " PREPAREDNESS. "* 

Preparedness is the topic of the hour. The 
press is filled with it, organizations are pro- 
moting it, military training camps are teach- 
ing it, and politicians are carefully surveying 
it as a possible political issue. Naturally, the 
publishers are not behindhand, but have pro- 
vided books for those who wish to read. 

The volumes to be considered in the present 
review vary greatly in quality and purpose. 
Professor Johnston's "Arms and the Race" 
exhibits a much broader and more philosophi- 
cal view of human relations than any of the 
others. It alone of these books shows that its 
author views society as an evolving organism 
which forever goes on to other things ; hence 
he alone has some idea of the philosophy which 
underlies anti-militarism, and considers the 
international mind worth some discussion. 
Like most of those persons who really know 
the past, he is not disposed to rest his case on 
it ; and so, unlike the other authors here noted, 
he does not consider statements of Washing- 
ton as final proof that we need a greater army 
to-day. He also recognizes that to get any- 
where one should rest one's case on facts 
instead of on opinions. Contending that the 
nationalizing of armies with the adoption of 
popular sovereignty has removed the danger 
of armies being agents of tyranny, the author 
continues with the view that the United States 
alone has not perceived that the modern army 
is not to be feared, and has consequently fallen 
behind other nations in its armaments. For 
this reason he holds that we need a greater 
military establishment. He favors strength- 
ening the navy primarily, and the army sec- 
ondarily, but making less than we are doing 
of coast defense.

tized for the " movies " under the title, " The 
Battle Cry of Peace." The book is clever and 
entertaining, and in parts gives evidence of 
having been written in collaboration with men 
in our army and navy. It is prepared dis- 
tinctly with one idea, to arouse the Amer- 
ican people to provide greater defenses. Its 
author does not, probably cannot, grasp the 
fundamentals of anti-militarism. No better 
illustration than this book could be found of 
what Mr. Norman Angell has called " one- 
sided aberration,"- the process of trying to 
solve questions involving many nations by 
considering only one of them. Mr. Maxim 
thinks that all will be well if we but get " ade- 
quate preparation," whatever that means. 
He neglects to state what effect our getting 
that preparation will have on other nations, 
which is a strange oversight ; for if his course 
for us is the highest wisdom, why should not 
rival nations continue to act on it ? It is need- 
less to state that Mr. Maxim says nothing about 
the final issue of the armament race between 
nations, beyond quoting ex-Secretary Meyer to 
the effect that " we are rich enough to match 
dollars for national defense with any other 
nation in the world." So the ultimate triumph 
is to be with dollars ! It does sound truer to 
experience to say that " dollars make right." 
It also contributes to make clear why Mr. 
Maxim should call the area wdthin two hun- 
dred miles around New York the "heart of 
America," though the reason which he ad- 
vances is that in this district lie most of the 
factories of armaments and war materials, and 
the coal beds for their use. After the fore- 
going one need not be surprised at a certain 
vein of prophecy and also finality in these 
pages. " It is a fact, which I absolutely know 
as certainly as anything can be known in hu- 
man affairs, that we . . are sitting to-day on 
a powder magazine with the train lighted," 
etc. To announce as a fact what cannot pos- 
sibly be other than an opinion of course ends 
all discussion. 

Major Carter's book on " The American 
Army" is the straightforward and unpreten- 
tious work of a professional man. The writer 
sticks to his specialty and to fact, and there- 
fore his book, though not entertaining read- 
ing, has real merit. 

Not so with Mr. Neeser's " Our Navy and the 
Next War," the title of which indicates that it 
has to do with things yet to come, rather than 
those.that w r e know about. The book is free and 
easy with opinions and generalizations that 
are announced as though they were axioms. 
It does not stick to its topic of the navy, but 
rambles considerably, and therefore repeats 
itself. Altogether, it is a compilation of the 



author's opinions and wishes, without an ade- 
quate presentation of his reasons for those 
opinions, and therefore cannot expect to con- 
vince its readers. 

"America Fallen ! " by Mr. J. Bernard 
Walker, editor of " The Scientific American," 
is the account of an imaginary invasion of the 
United States by Germany, one month after 
the end of the European War. There are some 
difficulties in making the thing reasonable, but 
the author surmounts these with the same 
superhuman skill that his Germans show in 
their attack on us. Mr. Walker is pro- Ally, 
hence Germany must be and is defeated in the 
present war. But for the sake of alarming us 
about our defenses, we must have an invasion. 
Of course England wouldn't think of this; 
hence it must be the Germans, even though de- 
feated. However, England, vexed at our con- 
duct during the Great War, does agree not to 
hinder Germany. The attack is planned and 
executed without a hitch of any consequence. 
The Germans get across the sea without any- 
body, even the British seemingly, getting word 
of it. They attack Boston, New York, Wash- 
ington (having slipped by the coast forts un- 
noticed) , and the Atlantic end of the Panama 
Canal on the same night, and with practically 
no difficulty or mistake. Two Germans cap- 
ture a ferry boat with its crew; the German 
submarines, having sneaked in at night, sink 
or destroy every warship in Norfolk yards and 
in the yards of the Newport News Shipbuild- 
ing Company. Even Nature favors the Ger- 
mans, for the fatal night is " unusually dark " ; 
the sea at Boston is " calm and clear " ; and at 
Coney Island, where the pleasure-seeking Ger- 
mans land a force, there is a "scarcely per- 
ceptible surf." Need it be added that, in the 
face of these supermen, we Americans prove 
to be plain fools, showing not a single bit of 
the initiative or ability about which we ordi- 
narily boast? Nobody in the whole "heart of 
America " thinks of destroying the New York 
Central tracks leading to Albany, of which the 
Germans take possession as they might take 
another glass of beer. ( It is pertinent to note 
here that Professor Johnston believes that 
Germany does not constitute a great danger to 
us at the present time; and that New York 
could probably be defended with complete 
success against a sea raid.) The effect of this 
book is questionable ; it may be pernicious, as 
others of its kind have been. So eager is it 
to insure its effect on Americans that it alto- 
gether forgets the effect it will have on the 
nation it represents as our foe. " The Battle 
of Dorking," which told of a similar invasion 
of England by Germany in 1875, increased

sides. Can we not secure adequate prepared- 
ness without goading our possible rivals into 
resentment and accelerated action ? 

The anonymous author of " Stultitia," who 
is " a former government official," employs 
the dramatic form to awaken us from our 
defenselessness. The book is melodramatic, 
appeals to blind emotion, makes the average 
congressman unpatriotic and shifty and the 
military man the real patriot. It, too, imag- 
ines a war which sets everybody right about 
preparation. It has not, to our present knowl- 
edge, been staged. 

Taken together these books show certain in- 
teresting similarities and divergencies. They 
all contend that we are unprepared. They 
offer programmes which differ in detail and 
exactness; but space forbids a discussion of 
these. All show a disposition to prophesy that 
we are to have a rude awakening unless we 
change our policy. They are unanimous ,in 
condemning the pacifist; but the prize for 
picturesqueness of vituperation must go to 
Mr. Maxim. Civilian control of the army and 
navy comes in for a good deal of condemna- 
tion ; Congress is freely blamed for sacrificing 
defense to politics ; and the people are charged 
with incompetence. Our authors agree in the 
main that national defense ought not to be 
made a matter of politics. 

Certain tendencies of other recent writers 
on preparedness reappear in these books. They 
rebuke our historians for making our past 
wars glorious, when in fact they were badly 
managed and unnecessarily drawn out. It is 
contended that the Monroe Doctrine has hith- 
erto endured chiefly because Great Britain 
protected it for us, but that she may refuse to 
do this any longer. 

All of the writers, so far as they express 
themselves on militarism, declare they are op- 
posed to it. Yet one cannot help but observe 
a certain admiration for the success of the 
German methods. Mr. Neeser would have uni- 
versal military service. Mr. Maxim thinks 
conscription in Germany produces excellent 
results, and states that it is not an unreasona- 
ble conclusion that militarism is responsible 
for the German culture of efficiency, since 
German militarism is the greatest school of 
economics that the world has ever seen. Else- 
where he says : " "We must play the game as 
a World Power, and as other nations are play- 
ing the game. To get fair play we must pro- 
vide ourselves with the weapons with which 
they are providing themselves." Mr. Maxim 
says he is opposed to militarism, and is urging 
"preparedness against war": yet his words 
just quoted are not very different from the 
utterances of Bernhardi. who is now every- 



where except in Germany regarded as 
the arch-priest of militarism. 

That the coming session of Congress will 
deal with the subject of preparedness is evi- 
dent, and as it should be. We want reasonable 
preparedness, but we ought to go about it 
rationally and not hysterically. Unhappily, 
some of the books here reviewed tend to cloud 
reason, and thus to benumb the very faculty 
which should give the country what it really

PETRARCH AGAIX.' 



In the Harvard copy of Professor Norton's 
catalogue of the Fiske Petrarch Collection in 
the library of Cornell University, there is 
preserved a letter from the late Professor 
Fiske. Norton had offered Fiske his copy of 
the Venetian folio of Petrarch Bevilaqua's 
of 1503. Pardonable satisfaction may be 
detected in his reply : " I already possess an 
excellent copy." The possessor of folios is 
not unfamiliar with this note of satisfaction; 
owner or not, one feels a stirring of pride in 
the knowledge that there are folios in the 
country, should one care to study them. 

The letter continues: "The Villa Forini 
[he was about to sail for Italy and Florence 
in July, 1883] will at least not lose its Scan- 
dinavian attractions, as I also take with me 
my Icelandic collection, the gathering of 
which, instead of being, as is my Petrarch 
collection, a whimsey of my old age. has been 
the work of many years. I hope to do some 
work with both these collections, but the 
danger is that I may fall between two very 
attractive stools." 

The letter is a poignant reminder of fruit- 
ful days at the Villa Forini. Professor Fiske 
gathered about him students and professors, 
silent scribes and talkative counts. He ar- 
ranged comforts for his American guests at 
which Browning might have cavilled as being 
un-Italian. But no change was made in the 
smoking-room at the top of the house. There 
old-fashioned frescoes in the slender strips of 
wall were left undisturbed and undiscerned 
between open spaces of purple haze beyond 
Fiesole. Ashes of American cigars might fall 
unheeded on the cement floor, where painted 
lizards flattened on painted stones. Char- 
treuse from without the Porta Romana gave 
pungency to talk about folios and manu- 
script, or, long remembered, mingled in flavor 
with the story of how Professor Rendell Har-

ris, in an eastern monastery, secured the rare 
Codex over " another glass of Rosoglio." 

Fears that the Icelandic and Italian Col- 
lections would be left in Europe were finally 
dispelled; and now the catalogues of the 
Fiske-Cornell libraries may be had, and the 
books are available within twenty-four hours, 
more or less. If we have appropriated so 
much of Italy, we are now also assimilating 
it. Petrarch's Latin works refuse to stay in 
folios : Columbia and the University of Chi- 
cago have revealed, most readably, some of 
the treasures first used in English by Chau- 
cer. Yale has given us the Concordance to 
the Italian poems. Sooner or later we may 
learn all that Petrarch himself wished us to 
know, without changing spectacles over the 
solid printed page, or halting to expand the 
Latin of incunabula. 

No labor is involved in reading the latest 
American book about Petrarch. In " Some 
Love Songs of Petrarch," Dr. William Dud- 
ley Foulke continues the long tradition of 
the English poets. If Chaucer made no son- 
net of his " Song of Troilus," he showed that 
Italian verse may be fitted to English. Yet 
even he, with his wealth of rhyme, most of it 
now lost to us, felt that it was impracticable 
to attempt complete imitation of Italian 
rhymes, every one of which had a feminine 
ending. Five masculine rhymes come first in 
the " Song of Troilus," then seven feminines, 
then masculines until the final couplet. In 
Dr. Foulke's version feminine rhymes appear 
now and then, oftener in other forms than 
the sonnet. Shakespearean are forty-six of 
his sonnets, and a Petrarchan sestette ap- 
pears in each of the other five. The object, 
then, has been to render the substance faith- 
fully in the more flexible English form; and 
in the cases selected for comparison this has 
been effectively done. Petrarch's enjambe- 
ments are at times preserved; in the four- 
teenth ode and in the " Hymn to the Virgin " 
one is reminded of the melody of Dry den. 
Monosyllables, the bane of the translator, 
have been avoided where possible. How 
could one escape them in turning such a 
rugged sestette as this? 

" Poi che se' sgombro della maggior salma 
L'altre puoi giuso agrevolmente porre, 
Salendo quasi un pellegrino scarce. 
Ben vedi omai siccome a morte corre 
Ogni cosa creata, e quanto all' alma 
Bisogna ir leve al periglioso varco." 

This is translated, with a courageous sub- 
junctive, as follows : 

" For, when delivered of thy heaviest load 
From what remains thou canst be quickly free, 



And like a pilgrim to thy new abode 

Rise all unburdened. Thou canst clearly see 

How all things move to death. Well may we 

pray 
The soul go light upon its perilous way." 

Yet the technique of the English sonnet, 
so challenging since Milton and Wordsworth, 
invites no tricks of the translator. The verse 
is never careless, nor is it mechanical or 
labored. With the diction Saxon and idioma- 
tic, and the style simple and severe, the 
reader will not be surprised to find lines of 
dignity and elevation, less Asiatic than 
Petrarch, less Italianate than older English 
translations. The introductory sonnet to 
Petrarch betrays restraint, and an artistic 
sense of the sonnet's limitations. It is grati- 
fying to record the classical spirit of this 
little volume when romantic, not to say untu- 
tored, freedom in verse invites public favor. 

A judicious Introduction and biographical 
sketch informs the reader without obtruding 
the quarrels of critics, French and Italian. 
An appendix, reviewing the attempts made 
to identify Laura, will stir the dullest of stu- 
dents or the most unliterary of psychologists. 
The " Epistle to Posterity " is printed, and a 
convenient list of Petrarch's works. The 
book must be welcome to all whose care it is 
to make a revue of literature stimulating, and 
devote a few precious hours to Petrarch and 
his influence. The general reader will be 
grateful for a fresh appraisement of the poet 
and the man. It is a useful complement to 
Professor Robinson's version of the "Letters" 
and his volume on Petrarch. Dr. Foulke, it 
may be urged, should not confine his verse 
to translation. 

One note to return to the folios may 
be added. The "six folio editions of his 
Epistles and other prose works printed at 
Basle and Venice between 1494 and 1500" 
(p. 121) have not all been identified. Fiske 
thought that the Deventer of 1494, the Basle 
of 1494 and 5, and the Venetian of 1496 



never existed.

field ready ploughed and sown, and only 
waiting for genial warmth and moisture to 
make it burst forth into life and eventual 
abundance." Gardens are of various kinds, 
but the developing interest referred to is that 
in flower gardens, kept by amateurs for the 
love of natural beauty. We have heard it 
said by those who ministered to the broken 
down and criminal classes in London, that 
men who seemed to have lost almost every 
good feeling would still respond to the beauty 
of flowers. In the mining camps of Colorado, 
where there has long been such bitter discon- 
tent with the conditions of life, the little rows 
of box-like houses stand in barren desolation, 
without the gardens which would make them 
at least resemble normal homes. Miners and 
owners alike would doubtless laugh at the 
suggestion that the lack of flowers was one of 
the things most seriously the matter with the 
whole situation ; yet the idea is by no means 
wholly grotesque, nor is it altogether false to 
say that the development of flower,gardens is 
a fair index to the civilization of a neighbor- 
hood. In England, when the " Garden Cit= 
ies " were first established, the factory hands, 
moved suddenly into rural surroundings, did 
not altogether like the change. What were 
gardens compared with the " movies," and all 
the excitement of city life ? In a year or two, 
however, they learned to appreciate their new 
opportunities, and settled down to a really 
normal life, which we hope will in course of 
time everywhere replace the distorting en- 
vironment of crow r ded towns. Thus in all 
schemes for human betterment, the garden 
necessarily has a large part, and floriculture 
becomes an intensely vital thing for the whole 
community, instead of a mere amusement for 
the rich. 

Mrs. Theodore Thomas writes of her " home- 
made" garden on a New Hampshire moun- 
tain as a thing beloved; growing under her 
hands and that of the " Meister," to whom we 
may well believe that flowers and music 
seemed to have a certain kinship, in the imme- 
diacy of their- appeal to the higher human 
emotions. Very charmingly are \ve led 
through the history of the garden's develop- 
ment, seeing almost with the author's eyes 
the many interesting little happenings, some 
triumphant, others quite the reverse. The 
combination of pure delight with innumerable 
little practical suggestions will appeal to all 
those who are growing flowers, although the 
exact circumstances will not be duplicated 
elsewhere. Then there is the keen interest in 
all that lives, in the birds and animals, all of 
which belong to the scheme of things and are 
part of the purpose for which the garden 



exists. There is a story of a French author, 
who was visited by a friend who was about 
to journey around the world. Said the au- 
thor : "I cannot leave my home ; but while 
you go around the world, I will go round my 
garden." This he did, and wrote a charming 
book about the things he saw. but he who 
circumnavigated the globe left nothing for 
posterity. Mrs. Thomas, in the same spirit, 
can stay at home and enjoy the drama of life, 
M r hich never becomes stale. 

Mrs. King writes a more ambitious book, in 
which she discusses, with the judgment born 
of experience, the planning of a somewhat 
elaborate garden. Much is said about color 
harmony and the grouping of plants, mat- 
ters w r hich the beginner is too likely to over- 
look, either from ignorance or indifference. 
Mrs. King writes : 

" I have a new profession to propose, a profes- 
sion of specialists : it should be called that of the 
garden colorist. The office shall be distinct from 
that of the landscape architect, distinct indeed 
from those whose office it already is to prescribe 
the plants for the garden. The garden colorist 
shall be qualified to plant beautifully, according to 
color, the best-planned gardens of our best design- 
ers. It shall be his duty, first, to possess a true 
color instinct; second, to have had much expe- 
rience in the growing of flowers, notably in the 
growing of varieties in form and color; third, so 
to make his planting plans that there shall be 
successive pictures of loveliness melting into each 
other with successive months; and last, he must 
pay, if possible, a weekly visit to his gardens, for 
no eye but his discerning one will see in them the 
evil and the good." 

Finally, it is suggested that " he " will usu- 
ally be a woman. This is not exactly the 
" home-made " idea of Mrs. Thomas, w r ho also 
appears to know nothing of " that man who 
must be constantly in sight of those who 
garden, the gardener, the paid, the earnest, 
and almost always the friendly, assistant in 
our labors w r ith flowers." 

Mrs. King's garden is not the back-yard of 
a cottage, nor are her plans those of a small 
clerk in a grocery store. We confess to a 
preference for the genuinely amateur point 
of view, which can make something worth 
while out of a window-box, and will under no 
circumstances abandon the control of things 
to a " discerning one " who will alone see this 
or that. Yet. after all, Mrs. King's main con- 
tention, set forth with such a wealth of exam- 
ples and illustrations, is entirely wise and 
sound. It is, that gardens, like houses, large 
or small, should be regarded in their entirety, 
and so planned that the parts harmonize. 
Furthermore, as in music, so in color and 
form, harmony is a reality, the sense of which

can and should be cultivated. By ignoring 
these things, we not only fail to develop some 
of our best faculties, but shut ourselves out of 
much of the pleasure of life. Thus " The 
Well-Considered Garden " has its mission 
even for those who have only a few yards of 
earth at their command; while its larger 
ideas may be carried out in public parks, 
under the stimulation of citizens who have 
been converted to the newer point of view. 
To those of us who are old enough to remem- 
ber the ribbon-like arrangement of flower- 
beds in the seventies of the last century, the 
tremendous advance in {esthetic feeling repre- 
sented by modern gardening is astonishing, as 
is the increasing variety of plants cultivated. 
Among the minor matters which we are led 
to consider, is the not unimportant one of 
names. We greatly need, in this country, 
some organization with power to standardize 
the names of garden varieties, or at least to 
prevent each dealer from giving new names to 
old things, with the implication that what he 
offers is different from that sold by his com- 
petitors. We would even suggest that short 
latinized names would sound better than 
some of the designations now in use. One 
can get used to anything, perhaps; but does 
it not sound a little queer to read in an 
orchid catalogue of " The Duke of Marlbor- 
ough, parentage unknown," or to be informed 
that Mrs. W. T. Ware is badly blighted? 
Professor Francis Darwin, the eminent bota- 
nist, is a living reality to us, and we do not 
altogether like to be told that his " tones are 
Rouge fraise No. 2 within the petals, Vin de 
Bordeaux No. 2 outside." Were the tulip 
named Danvini, there could be no offence, 
and the name would be less cumbersome.

RECENT FICTION.* 



Mr. H. G. Wells is the chief figure in En- 
glish letters nowadays. Mr. Arnold Bennett i 
may rival him when the story of Clayhanger 
and Hilda Lessways is finished. Mr. Bernard j 
Shaw seems under a cloud, and Mr. Chester- j 
ton spends much time on the Lethe-wharf of j 
journalism. But Mr. Wells continues to think 
indefatigably. and to write almost as by in- 
stinct. He is, of course, deeply concerned 
with the day-to-day anxieties of the war,

like every other Englishman worth his salt ; 
but he seems to be able to disregard that hor- 
ror, at least in his thinking. Mr. Wells's 
thoughts are prone to run ahead of the actual 
event: in "The World Set Free" he said 
what he had to say of the war before people 
had much of an idea that there was to be one. 
Now his ideas have got back to the regular 
line, he does not write as though the war 
were over, but rather as though there had 
been no war; he is going ahead on the road 
whereon he was moving before. 

Several of Mr. Wells's books have been stud- 
ies of society from the general standpoint; 
but in some of his later stories, such as " The 
New Macchiavelli " and " The Passionate 
Friends," he has been more interested in 
thinking of what the individual life could do 
in and for society. His latest book, " The 
Research Magnificent," is the story of a man 
who, being unlimited by minor matters, set 
himself to find some " theory of his work and 
duty in the world, a plan of the world's 
future that should give a rule to his life." 

"A world-state sustained by an aristocracy 
of noble men," that idea or theory is not 
new to a reader of Wells; but here will be 
found someone who tried to work out some 
practical way in the matter. "Not a novel," 
one may readily say, just as White, the 
literary man who was called to look over Ben- 
ham's papers, said, when the magnificent 
search had come to an end. It is not unlike 
those autobiographical novels that (as Mr. 
Wells once wrote) "were popular throughout 
the third and fourth decades of the twentieth 
century." It is the work of a novelist, of 
course, a story by a man who feels things 
keenly, a man who is sensitive, appreciative, 
humorous, whimsical. But it is chiefly a mat- 
ter of record, valuable for the results it has 
in it. 

The main thing from this standpoint is that 
now Mr. Wells has his eye on the limitations 
of the finer life. What is it that prevents 
those who desire from being the aristocrats of 
the newer world? Benham, with the keenest 
desire, finds himself continually hindered, 
limited, "cribbed, cabined, and confined," 
stopped from something here, held back from 
something there. Mr. Wells has settled in his 
own mind the four great limitations of life : 
fear, sex, jealousy, prejudice ; and he presents 
the experience of Benham with each. r These 
are individual limitations, it will be seen, not 
caused by social life. 

All that is stimulating, especially to 
those who have other limitations, also, which 
Benham had not : income, education or lack 
of it. " circumstances.'' and so forth. But one

must confess that Benham, whatever he 
learned or found out or decided for himself, 
seems actually " not to live but know/' or, if 
not to know, to strive for knowledge. The 
search for knowledge is a fascinating thing, 
one of the most fascinating things in the 
world, if it be not the finest. But in this 
book it weighs on the reader somehow that 
Benham brings nothing to pass, and does not 
even try. And that rather impoverishes the 
novel though it may thereby be more like life. 
Benham was a pioneer. Perhaps now that he 
has lived his life with less accomplishment 
than knowledge, others may put his inven- 
tions to everyday use. However that may be, 
this is one of Mr. Wells's interesting books, 
full of things wholly in his especial way, like 
the experiences in the Balkans, and aimed at 
a high ideal, bringing into a definite form 
many fine ideas that one has met with else- 
where in Mr. Wells's work. 

Mr. Theodore Dreiser does not hold the 
commanding position in letters that Mr. 
Wells does, but his work is always worth 
while, for he has certain fine possessions, one 
of which is a vast amount of knowledge of 
the thing he is writing about, which is joined 
to an unrestricted willingness and great abil- 
ity to impart whatever he knows. Eugene 
Witla, the chief figure of his new novel, 
" The ' Genius,' " is not in the least like Ben- 
ham, but his very unlikeness suggests much. 
Mr. Wells's man, like Mr. Wells himself, was 
intent on knowledge, in a large way a scien- 
tist, a person who wanted to know. Mr. 
Dreiser's character is an artist. Whether Mr. 
Dreiser means that he is a great artist, or 
only that people think he is. may be doubtful. 
The quotation-marks in the title imply a 
query which becomes more insistent as one 
reads the book. Certainly Mr. Dreiser con- 
veys no notion of a great artist that is ade- 
quate to ordinary conceptions; he presents a 
man of "artistic temperament" who has no 
ideas or feelings that are not shared by many. 
His ideas of art seem ordinary, such as would 
come from a reading of the magazines. Here 
Mr. Dreiser seems deficient. He gives chap- 
ter and verse for most of Witla's acts and 
ideas; but for his artistic aims and accom- 
plishments, even so far as they go, he depends 
usually on what seem rather bare common- 
places. Perhaps he means to do so. What- 
ever he means, he has depicted a man very 
unlike Mr. Wells's creation. Benham was a 
man of average abilities who was led to a fine 
life by mere determination ; Witla was a man 
of great abilities who passed through strug- 
gle, success, failure, without any definite mo- 
tive or idea, except that of doing just as he 



liked at any given time. " He loved beauty, 
not a plan in life," that is what Mr. Dreiser 
says of him. That may be the real difference 
between artist and scientist: Benham had a 
plan. But Witla's love of beauty (as of course 
one will guess) brought about a great deal 
that would make any plan of life look rather 
mean. 

Whatever kind of man he was and let us 
be glad of a chance not to take him for a 
typical American, great artist or not Mr. 
Dreiser presents him with his usual remarka- 
ble vitality. He seems to do this by a multi- 
tude of details that flow .from his pen as 
readily as ideas come from Mr. Wells, and 
much more voluminously. This is a good 
thing; it gives confidence. Compare Mr. 
Dreiser in this respect with another American 
novelist: Mr. Winston Churchill at a critical 
point of his hero's career tells us that his 
religious beliefs underwent a change, caused 
by three months reading in books furnished 
by the head of the public library. What were 
the particular ideas and what were the par- 
ticular books we are, with a few exceptions, 
left to guess. But Mr. Dreiser, when (rather 
by the way) Witla becomes reconciled to some 
sort of religious feeling, tells us exactly what 
ideas he had and exactly what books he read. 
In half a dozen pages he puts a great mass of 
detail ; it may be good or bad, sound thinking 
or not, but there it is. If it is worth while 
you can look it up and see what it is all about. 
You do not have to take it on trust. That is 
the way with Mr. Dreiser, as a rule. He is 
generally " there with the goods," as they say. 
Many do not care for what he offers, but at 
least he does offer it. And that is a great 
thing. It means an original imagination. 
We do not have a big figure struck out in 
outline from a set of ideas actually or conven- 
tionally held. We have a figure definitely 
conceived, doing this and that, thinking and 
feeling this and that; but in all his thinking, 
feeling, and doing, quite definite, real, and 
vital, except in the one point mentioned, 
where perhaps Mr. Dreiser meant that his 
" genius " was not definite, real, and vital, and 
therefore necessitated the quotation-marks. 

In " Eltham House " Mrs. Humphry Ward 
had a subject which was certainly, as she con- 
ceived it, an immensely good one. She 
thought of the case of Lord Holland, who in 
1796 ran away with the wife of Sir Godfrey 
Webster, and subsequently became a great 
figure in English social and political life: and 
in meditating on the questions involved, she 
thought of presenting the same case to-day. 
Would the twentieth century endure a man 
whom the nineteenth century had honored?

What sort of change in manners and morals 
would the experiment bring forth? It will 
be no surprise that Lord Wing, when he tries 
to enter politics, finds that his alliance with 
a charming and able woman who had left her 
husband for him, constitutes an insuperable 
obstacle, in. spite of divorce and marriage. 
Most people would agree with Mrs. Ward in 
her estimate of current feeling. Her book is 
rather disappointing, however, in that it does 
not really deal with the subject presented. 
Mrs. Ward does not seem to try to give an 
adequate idea of how people at large feel 
about such matters. Lord Wing fails, almost 
by an accident, on the arousing of a senti- 
ment against him. which Mrs. Ward presents 
in the main as narrow and prejudiced, if not 
mean. That may have been just what she 
meant to do. If she did, one would think that 
she misread public feeling ; if she did not, she 
hardly carried out her first idea. More prob- 
ably, however, Mrs. Ward really gave little 
attention to the larger, the social, aspects of 
the case ; for most of her effort is given, and 
that successfully, to a presentation of the 
position of Lady Wing. The novel is really 
very little of a social document, but rather 
the picture of a personal experience. 

This is true. also, some will say, of Judge 
Grant's new book. " The High Priestess." It 
is the story of a woman of our day, a woman 
of ability and character, who is presented as 
having misunderstood the true direction of 
woman's progress and as only reaching a true 
valuation of her own great powers after much 
trouble and difficulty. Here readers will dif- 
fer as to whether we have a particular story 
or a general case. I think the former, but the 
fact is one of sociology or current history 
rather than of literature. 

It is more than a generation, now, that 
Mr. Grant has been an observer of society and 
a maker of books, and in that time his eye has 
not grown dim or his hand lost its cunning. 
He began as something of a satirist in a 
lighter way, and he has never quite lost the 
satirical touch. He continued in life in a 
profession that is almost of necessity mindful 
of general laws and regular precedents. Such 
a combination of influences, one might think, 
would render impossible either the exuberant 
ideality of Mr. Wells or the elaborate imagi- 
nation of Mr. Dreiser or the personal sym- 
pathy of Mrs. Ward. But it gives other 
things quite as interesting, all sorts' of pic- 
tures of manners and character ; so that the 
book is good reading even to those who do not 
care for its thesis. But it does not succeed in 
giving something which is lacking in the oth- 
ers as well, and which is very often lacking 



in the fiction of our day, namely, power of 
construction: ability so to order one's mate- 
rial as to make the most telling effect on those 
who read. That is one of the great things of 
fiction, Mr. James has it preeminently, and 
Mrs. Wharton and some others of our day. 
Any of the above books would be better with 
it, if they lost nothing else thereby.

BRIEFS oxJSjsw BOOKS. 

If proof were required of the 
obvious fact that the intellec- 
tual and spiritual development 
of the human mind is taking place at present 
chiefly along the feminine side, it may be 
found in the number of first-rate contribu- 
tions to the study of religious psychology 
that are being offered by women writers. 
Following upon the excellent triad of books 
on Mysticism by Miss Evelyn Underbill, we 
welcome Miss Annie Lyman Sears's " The 
Drama of the Spiritual Life" (Macmillan). 
The Introduction by Professor Josiah Royce 
adds much to the interest of the work; and 
though any conscious or intentional direction 
of Miss Sears's arguments and conclusions is 
generously disavowed by Professor Royce, it 
is not difficult for anyone who is acquainted 
with " The Problem of Christianity " and 
" The Philosophy of Loyalty " to trace the 
influence of the master on the pupil. Nor 
need this be regarded as in any sense a dero- 
gation from the claim to originality on the 
part of the writer. We are all in large part 
what our teachers have made us, and the 
highest service any writer can perform is to 
"interpret" the truth and focus the light 
generated through the spiritual experiences 
under which his own mind has been formed. 
In the opening chapter, Miss Sears deals with 
religious idealism in a particularly satisfying 
manner, and reveals the distinguishing char- 
acteristic of Man as a creature who "looks 
before and after," who creates ideals and is 
unhappy because of his inability to attain to 
them. How the ideal which is " not his actual 
self but beyond his present self" becomes 
sublimated into the concept of God, and this 
in turn " becomes moralized and spiritualized 
into the Absolute Self," is discussed in a way 
that does no violence to the thought that the 
law of continuous evolution has ordered the 
course of spiritual as well as physical devel- 
opment. The consciousness of sin becoming 
ever more keen as ideals of perfection rise 
higher, is seen to be a natural corollary to 
growth in grace; and its ultimate develop-

ment into that consciousness of moral re- 
sponsibility for the sins and oppressions of 
society which so strikingly characterizes mod- 
ern times, is shown to be what it is, a step 
toward the ultimate end of all religion, 
union with the beloved community. Very 
timely, however, is the warning that " the 
emphasis on the social experience easily tends 
to the external and mechanical, and yet the 
conscious goal of the modern .social movement 
is not an external and mechanical one. It is 
in part brotherhood, but not merely broth- 
erhood. It is in part an emphasis on the 
enhancement of life, that is, on a value which 
is aesthetic and individual as well as social." 
" Shall we not," our author asks, " behold a 
new type of rebel? The rebellion of the new 
day will come, I believe, not from the rebels 
against established religion, but from the 
idealists, the artists and poets, for it is 
these who to-day suffer under the authority 
of scientific-materialism and of social prac- 
tical life." If it does not seem ungracious to 
say so of a book that is good in every page, 
we could have wished it had been considera- 
bly shorter. When so much claims our atten- 
tion, it makes too great a draft upon time and 
thought to face nearly five hundred pages of 
closely printed matter of a kind that forbids 
" judicious skipping." With this qualifica- 
tion, we estimate " The Drama of the Spir- 
itual Life" as among the most valuable of 
recent contributions to the subject dealt with. 



Problem, of Although the end of the great 
readjustment European war is not yet in 
sight, discussion of the probable 
results, economic, social, and political, and of 
the problems of reconstruction that must be 
faced by Europe after the conclusion of peace, 
has already begun. In a collection of essays 
entitled " The Problems of Readjustment 
after the War" (Appleton), a group of dis- 
tinguished American professors has under- 
taken to forecast certain of these results, and 
to point out the problems of readjustment. 
Professor Hart of Harvard, who is the editor 
of the volume, discusses some of the political 
transformations that have already occurred, 
particularly in respect to democracy, and 
some that are likely to take place in conse- 
quence of the war. He points out that the 
measures to which some of the belligerent 
governments have been compelled to resort 
have given a marked stimulus to Socialism, 
which as a principle has never before in the 
history of mankind won such a victory. The 
method of the war, he tells us, has given the 
Socialists ammunition for half a century to 
come by proving that the community can 



work more efficiently through collective effort 
than through individual effort. Whether the 
war will enhance the principle of representa- 
tive government depends in a large degree, 
he thinks, upon the success of republican 
France and democratic England. Finally, he 
asserts that there are certain lessons which 
we in America can learn from European ex- 
perience during the war, especially in regard 
to organization for defence. Professor Selig- 
man of Columbia undertakes the more diffi- 
cult task of discovering the origins of the 
war in economic rather than in political 
causes. His economic interpretation of the 
war shows originality and insight, but his 
theory of causes is not entirely convincing. 
Professor Giddings, also of Columbia, deals 
with the social aspects and results of the war, 
with particular reference to their bearing 
upon the future birth rate and the character 
of the offspring begotten by those left behind 
and the physically enfeebled who return. His 
conclusions are less pessimistic than those 
popularly held ; indeed, he is skeptical enough 
to doubt whether war greatly affects the 
course of natural selection. Professor Wil- 
loughby of Joljns Hopkins University, in an 
essay on "The Individual and the State/' 
contrasts the German theory of state control 
with that which prevails in England and the 
United States. The German doctrine, which 
largely sacrifices the individual to the State, 
possesses, he admits, elements of lofty ideal- 
ism, but it rests on a false assumption and 
demands sacrifices for which no real return 
is made. He agrees with Professor Hart that 
if the extraordinary extension of state func- 
tions produces good results the regime will 
in many instances be continued after peace 
is established. Professor Wilson of Harvard 
reviews the conduct of the belligerents in 
respect to their observance or non-observance 
of the laws of war, and points out possi- 
ble modifications in the existing rules that 
may be necessary on account of the new 
agencies and methods of warfare. One of 
the most valuable essays in the volume is 
that by Professor Emory R. Johnson of the 
University of Pennsylvania, who considers 
the financial and commercial aspects of the 
war and the probable results on international 
trade, the rate of interest, investments, credit, 
etc. Professor Johnson thinks the interest 
rate will undoubtedly be higher, that there 
will be 'an abnormal inflation of credit, that 
the American supply of gold will be greatly 
reduced, that a period of business depression 
will in all likelihood follow the war. and that 
there will probably be a marked rise in the 
tide of immigration.

From Waterloo 
to Liege. 



The fourth and concluding: vol- 
ume of Mr. Arthur D. Innes's 
"History of England and the 
British Empire" (Macmillan) covers the full 
and intensely interesting period from 1802 to 
1914, and has been finished since the beginning 
of the "^schylean drama " now being enacted 
upon the stage of Europe. Thus the writing 
of this volume has laid upon the author the 
task of opening and closing his narrative with 
the circumstance of a general European war. 
His treatment, at the outset, of the Napoleonic 
struggle has the advantage of a century of 
historical perspective; the volume ends with 
a nine-page epilogue which outlines the well 
known events from 1911 to the outbreak of 
hostilities among the protagonists of the pres- 
ent war. The account of the military and 
economic conditions leading to the Peace of 
Amiens, which opens the first of the eleven 
chapters of the book, shows very clearly that 
England's re-entrance into the continental 
upheaval was self-defensive. Napoleon's pur- 
pose to absorb the small states of Holland 
and Switzerland, as well as the little princi- 
palities of Germany, involved the presump- 
tion that the affairs of the continent were no 
concern of England's. This imperial attitude 
led to the conflict that ended at Waterloo. 
As the student of this period reads again, in 
Mr. Innes's well written account, the story of 
Napoleon's attempt at imperial expansion by 
conquest, he will find himself reflecting upon 
how far the French and German positions of 
a century ago have changed places, and to 
what extent the political principle on which 
insular England then fought France is re- 
asserting itself in the present "pentacost of 
calamity." Mr. Innes traces the story of 
Britain's succession of great changes during 
the century in politics, industry, and litera- 
ture. His treatment of persons and events is 
admirable in proportion, and his style is 
always free from obscurity and iteration. 
His judgments on the greater English writers 
are expressed with dignity and with insight, 
and he speaks clearly and sympathetically 
throughout of the growth of democracy among 
the English people. As he reaches the latter 
half of his story, however, his comment at 
points becomes less satisfactory. This is par- 
ticularly true of his treatment of foreign 
affairs. His exposition, for example, of the 
" Trent affair " is somewhat misleading. A 
mere statement of facts without comment 
would have been better. There seems to be 
no real ground for the phrase that Lincoln's 
position in the matter, which averted war, 
was "yielded, though with an ill grace" 
(page 303). This statement, as well as 



another on page 460 to the effect that Presi- 
dent Cleveland's attitude in the Canadian 
Fisheries Treaty and the Venezuelan dispute 
" was an electioneering move," and that Lord 
Salisbury's management of the affair was un- 
influenced " by the blatancy of the presiden- 
tial appeal," is too journalistic for historical 
purposes. Mr. Innes's volume is rendered 
still more useful by the addition of an ab- 
stract of a recently issued report of the 
British Admiralty stating in detail the tac- 
tics employed by Nelson and Collingwood at 
Trafalgar. The abstract is accompanied by 
a good diagram exhibiting the relative posi- 
tions of the French and English at the point 
of attack, as well as the relative parts played 
by the two English commanders in the battle. 



Platitude, Dr - Charles W. Eliot's "The 

for the college Training for an Effective Life " 
(Houghton) is a compact little 
volume containing seven lectures or addresses 
to students. When one recalls some of the 
classic utterances to students by Emerson, 
Carlyle, and others, one realizes all that such 
exhortations to the higher life by a veteran 
scholar might be, and one regrets the more 
that such exhortations should contain any- 
thing that savors of the merely platitudinous. 
In few sentences does Dr. Eliot's book rise 
above the level of Samuel Smiles's " Self- 
Help." The Englishman's heaven of "Getting 
on " is too persistently held before the mind 
of the reader. One is forced to recall Ruskin's 
scathing satire on that idea of " advancement 
in life" which means having a visitor's and 
servant's bell at one's door, and his sugges- 
tion that advancement in life conceived in 
such terms may mean literally " advancement 
in death"; or that the most pathetic life- 
failures are to be found among what the 
world calls the effective successes. We are 
distressed, also, by one or two obvious slips 
which amount almost to a descent into the 
grotesque. On page 5 the author defines an 
honorable man as "one who never oppresses 
or cheats a person that is weaker or poorer 
than himself." We had assumed that an 
honorable man is equally scrupulous in his 
dealings with the powerful and rich. Again, 
the student is enjoined to "associate with 
your superiors rather than with your infe- 
riors; this is an excellent rule on which to 
select your friends." The obvious rejoinder 
is that this may turn out to be rather hard 
upon our superiors; and that the altruism 
which Dr. Eliot assures his readers "is an 
important element in the enjoyment of most 
kinds of work," might suggest seeking the 
companionship of our inferiors for the infe- 



426 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 11 



riors' sake if not for our own. Some one has 
said of Jesus that he not only loved the poor 
and outcast ; he did more, he liked them, and 
preferred their company to that of the rich 
and powerful. Perhaps Dr. Eliot intends his 
injunction to point to our spiritual superiors, 
regardless of wealth, education, or social 
status; but we fear that most readers of his 
address entitled " The Character of a Gentle- 
man " will hardly interpret his words in this 
way. On the whole, this little book does 
nothing to enhance the high estimate in which 
Dr. Eliot is held, and for that reason we could 
have wished it had not been published. 



Favorites 
in poetry 
and fiction. 



"A Book of Preferences in Lit- 
erature " (Dutton), by Mr. 
Eugene Mason, is well named. 
The author presents a few of his favorites in 
poetry and fiction, and tells why they are his 
favorites. The list contains ten names: M. 
Anatole France, Mr. Kipling, Guy de Mau- 
passant, Jose-Maria de Heredia, Mr. W. B. 
Yeats, Christina Rossetti, Paul Verlaine, 
Francis Thompson, Walter Pater, and the 
author of the " Roman de Brut/' The second 
and third names figure prominently in a chap- 
ter on " The Short Story," in which is traced 
the development of that form of literary art 
and it is asserted that England shares with 
France the glory of having revived the conte 
in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, 
with no slightest reference to America's nota- 
ble contribution to this species of literature. 
The author .of " Sylvestre Bonnard " is made 
to serve as an example of " the complete scep- 
tic," Heredia is "the poet as artist," Mr. 
Yeats is " the poet as mystic," Christina Ros- 
setti and Paul Verlaine appear as " two Chris- 
tian poets," Francis Thompson as " a Catholic 
poet," "Walter Pater is exalted, as a master of 
English, to an eminence not below that of 
Shakespeare, Lamb, and Newman, and "Wace's 
name heads a hitherto unpublished introduc- 
tion to the King Arthur portion of the 
"Roman de Brut." The atmosphere of the 
little volume is that of refined taste and care- 
ful scholarship, and in its style the book is a 
refreshing oasis in the desert of arid medi- 
ocrity of facile English. Admirably expres- 
sive is the author's characterization of the 
sonnet as viewed by the average reader. " I 
believe," he says, "the public considers the 
sonnet a very hard boiled egg at best." 



No one would think of applying 
Mr. Wister's playful metaphor 
of quackery to the kindly and 
venerable author of the sayings in "An Art 
Philosopher's Cabinet" (Putnam) ; yet many 



The Harold 
Bell Wright of 
art criticism. 



of these sayings show a parallelism with the 
quotations from best-selling novels that Mr. 
Wister has adduced. Mr. George Lansing 
Raymond's books on aesthetic subjects have 
become so many, it seems, that a chrestomathy 
is necessary, to supplement the compendium 
already issued. The congenial task of prepar- 
ing it has fallen to his disciple, Mr. Marion 
Mills Miller, who shows the same appreciation 
as in his earlier four-hundred-page classified 
selection from Mr. Raymond's poetical works. 
A semester under Theodor Vischer. which 
convinced him that the basis of art is expres- 
sion, a sympathetic reading of Ruskin. an 
astonishing accumulation of curious lore, 
together with a sound piety of character, have 
been Mr. Raymond's equipment in writing his 
voluminous system of comparative aesthetics. 
The Burlington " Hawkeye," " The Christian 
Register," and " The Fireside," with some 
more sophisticated periodicals, have united in 
acclaiming the successive volumes, as the pub- 
lishers recite with pardonable gratification. 
For those who have not had the leisure to read 
them, we may quote the following statement 
by Mr. Miller of one of his author's most 
important fundamental propositions : " The 
primary and most universal endeavor of the 
imagination when influenced by the artistic 
tendency is to form an image that is made to 
seem a unity by comparing and grouping 
together effects that, when seen or heard, are 
recognized to be wholly or partially alike." 
Those who wish an inspiring and reverent 
treatment of artistic topics incidental to the 
main theme, cannot do better than refer to 
the sections under such rubrics as " Fads in 
Art," " Nude Art," and so on. As the Buf- 
falo " Courier " says of the companion vol- 
ume. " The compiler has done fine work." 



The disease 
of lying. 



Dr. and Mrs. William Healy 
have written an interesting and 
significant book under the title, 
"Pathological Lying, Accusation, and Swin- 
dling," which forms the initial number of 
the "Criminal Science Monographs" (Little. 
Brown & Co.). Of the nineteen cases of 
" normal " mentality here dealt with, in which 
at least the lying is the central symptom and 
in some cases the total abnormality, all but 
one are young women (ages mostly sixteen to 
nineteen.) Thus it will be seen that the mal- 
ady is a strikingly feminine failing; which 
means that the masculine counterpart of the 
kindred disorder takes a different form. One 
girl comes with a pathetic story of family 
tragedy; another is a mystery to herself and 
friends: a third simulates illness and makes 
the rounds of the hospitals: a fourth accuses

her father of immorality and also indulges in 
shoplifting; a fifth confesses to her professor 
that she has killed a man ; a sixth indulges in 
wild romancing about all sorts of exploits; a 
seventh is plainly incorrigible and includes 
lying among her bad habits ; the eighth, ninth, 
tenth, and the rest range from mild falsifica- 
tion, petty swindling, accusing self and others 
of imaginary crimes with elaboration of de- 
tails, to most serious criminal violations and 
charges. From beginning to end it is a tissue 
of lies, and, until the clue is found, a baffling 
one. Many of these cases come forward in 
the courts or in preliminary legal investiga- 
tion, when testimony is contradictory or scan- 
dal seems unfounded. Society has an interest 
in such offenders ; and the clear connection in 
many cases with subnormal mentality estab- 
lishes the close relation of such vagaries with 
mental deviation. Dr. Healy seems inclined 
to limit the diagnosis of hysteria to cases 
with marked major or bodily symptoms, and 
thus loses the chance to expand the hysterical 
concept to precisely fit his cases. The self- 
centred mentality, the alliance with the sex- 
impulse, the desire for attention, interest, 
sensation, the weak hold of the objective world, 
the indulgence in romancing, make a classic 
picture of the hysterical culture-bed. As a 
fact, his cases have simply carried the issue 
to a more dramatic conclusion. They ap- 
proach the borderland, and some belong on 
the yonder side. The feminine quality of the 
complex is equally convincing, as is also the 
occasional alliance with nervous symptoms 
equally characteristic of the feminine liabil- 
ity. The collection of cases is valuable, and 
the interpretation restrained and objective. 
The facts are available for some interesting 
psychological and sociological conclusions. 



History of 
dubious value. 



It is reported that when the 
Kaiser sent his soldiers to 
China in the year of the Boxer 
uprising, he counselled them to terrorize the 
Chinese as the Huns terrorized the people of 
Europe in the fifth century. The story may 
be mythical, but Englishmen find it very 
credible just now and frequently refer to the 
German soldiers as Huns. In order to prove 
that the appellation is not without its justifi- 
cation, Mr. Edward Hutton has written a vol- 
ume on "Attila and the Huns" (Button), in 
which Attila's policy of " f rightf ulness " is 
illustrated by the citing of recent events and 
parallels. The author also accepts and con- 
tends for the theory that the Prussians are of 
Finnic origin, and consequently of the same 
race as the Huns. We do not know much 
about Attila's career, so his story is soon told ; 



to lengthen the book somewhat, the author 
has published his sources, which comprise 
about one-third of the volume. If these were 
translated, their introduction might be of real 
value ; but there seems to be but little justifi- 
cation for printing Latin documents in a book 
which is evidently intended for popular con- 
sumption. In his account of the preliminaries 
of the battle of Chalons. which, by the way, 
was also fought on the Marne, Mr. Hutton 
takes occasion to rebuke the Americans for 
their failure to assist the allies: "The Visi- 
goths replied as America is doing to-day : ' It 
is not our business ; see you to it.' " Mr. 
Hutton's history can have no value, and can 
serve no purpose except to stir up hatred ; but 
unfortunately it is to be feared that in this 
respect it will not differ from much of the 
history to be written during the next decade. 



As seen from 
the editor's 
sanctum. 



Rather unusual must be the cir- 
cumstances justifying the pub- 
lication of a four-hundred-page 
volume of short editorials on questions of the 
day that is, of the day on which they sev- 
erally were written. But the publishers 
(George H. Doran Co.) of "National Flood- 
marks: Week by Week Observations on 
American Life as Seen by Collier's " would 
doubtless maintain that " Collier's " is no 
ordinary newspaper-, and in fact the editor 
of the book, Mr. Mark Sullivan, takes pains 
to inform the reader that no perfunctory 
utterances have ever been allowed to deaden 
the vivacity of that weekly's editorial col- 
umns. Each article is "the sincere expres- 
sion of either a conviction or a mood," and 
not "written to order," he earnestly assures 
us. These selected expressions of convictions 
and moods run back over four years and are 
grouped under twenty-three general headings, 
making a total of about three hundred more 
or less piquant paragraphs on topics not yet 
of purely antiquarian interest. Admirers of 
Mr. Norman Hapgood's trenchant style might 
wish the volume to have been extended so as 
to cover an even longer period. There is, 
however, good reading in plenty, of the sort 
here indicated, in the present collection. 



True stories 
of the deaf 
and the blind. 



Miss Margaret Prescott Mon- 
tague tells a number of pathetic 
and moving stories about some 
of the little deaf children and blind children 
whom she has learned to know as only a sym- 
pathetic teacher (next to a loving mother) 
can know them. "Closed Doors" (Hough- 
ton) she appropriately names this collection 
of first-hand narratives from a certain State 
school for the deaf and blind. Touching in-

deed is the story she tells of the little deaf 
and dumb boy who heroically and successfully 
struggled to articulate the one word that gave 
ecstasies of rapture to his blind mother when 
next she visited him at the school. Equally 
moving is the account of the deaf boy threat- 
ened with blindness and vainly trying to 
wipe away the darkness from his eyes. The 
pompous and unfeeling Mr. Prouty, head of 
the Board of Control and an astute politician, 
is also well portrayed; one is glad to see, in 
the end, that the piteous sights before him do 
finally move him to some show of feeling. 
Dr. Richard C. Cabot warmly commends the 
book in an appreciative preface. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

Publication of the late Francis Fisher Browne's 
" Every-Day Life of Lincoln " has been taken over 
by Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons, and the book is 
now issued in a new and cheaper edition. Since 
its first appearance, nearly thirty years ago, this 
work has gradually taken precedence in popular- 
ity over all other biographies of Lincoln ; and the 
excellent form of this new edition, combined with 
the low price, will undoubtedly ensure for it a 
still wider circle of readers than it has hitherto 
had. A fine photogravure reproduction of Mar- 
shall's portrait of Lincoln is included as a frontis- 
piece, and there are two other portraits in the 
volume. 

One of the latest school texts in English history 
is the " Short History of England and the British 
Empire" (Holt), by Professor Laurence M. Lar- 
son of the University of Illinois. This book covers 
the field adequately for secondary schools. It is 
written in a clear and direct style, and constitutes 
one of the most readable texts in its class, at the 
same time producing the impression of a scholarly 
acquaintance with the sources. The industrial and 
social facts, as well as the political, are dealt with. 
There are nearly seven hundred pages in the vol- 
ume, and a number of illustrations are included. 
As a text for high schools, it will doubtless meet 
with general favor. 

The momentous events now transpiring in the 
Far East make timely the new edition of Sir 
William Muir's "The Caliphate: Its Rise, De- 
cline, and Fall." First issued in 1883, the book 
at once became the standard treatment in English 
of its subject. Subsequent editions appeared in 
1891 and 1899, and now Mr. T. H. Weir has 
given the work a thorough revision. Among the 
changes which he introduces are the adoption of 
the system of Arabic transliteration followed by 
the Royal Asiatic Society, the incorporation of 
many observations from Wellhausen's "Das Ara- 
bische Reich und Sein Sturz," and the compilation 
of an up-to-date bibliography. The publisher, 
Mr. John Grant of Edinburgh, has given this new 
edition a most attractive and workmanlike setting. 



NOTES. 



An English edition of Mr. H. C. Chatfield- 
Taylor's scholarly biography of Goldoni will be 
published at once by Messrs. Chatto & Windus of 
London. 

A critical study of Mr. Kipling by Mr. John 
Palmer will be added at once to the " Writers of 
the Day " series, issued under the imprint of 
Messrs. Holt. 

" The Psychology of Relaxation " by Mr. G. T. 
W. Patrick, announced for autumn publication by 
the Houghton Mifflin Co., has been postponed 
until next spring. 

An additional title soon to appear in the " New 
Poetry Series " is "Stillwater Pastorals, and Other 
Poems " by Mr. Paul Shivell, with a preface by 
Professor Bliss Perry. 

Three books of fiction, hitherto unannounced, to 
be published this month by Messrs. Appleton are 
" The Winged Victory " by Mme. Sarah Grand, 
" Birds' Fountain " by Baroness von Hutten, and 
"Police! " by Mr. Robert W. Chambers. 

A collection of stories and poems by Mr. H. 
Fielding-Hall is announced by Messrs. Houghton 
Mifflin Co. The volume is inspired by the present 
situation in Europe, and more specifically by inci- 
dents and methods of recruiting in England. 

Many of the monuments and other treasures 
shattered in the war are illustrated and described 
in the new volume by Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champ- 
ney, entitled " Romance of Old Belgium," whicli 
Messrs. Putnam have nearly ready for publication. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett's first-hand impressions of 
the war will be published by Messrs. Doran under 
the title of " Over There." From the same house 
will come Mr. David Lloyd George's " Through 
Terror to Triumph," being a collection of war 
speeches. 

" Wood and Stone " is the title of a forthcoming 
novel by Mr. John Cowper Powys whicli will be 
published about the middle of this month by Mr. 
G. Arnold Shaw of New York. The book is 
described as " a dramatic answer to Nietzsche's 
philosophy." 

Mr. Conway Whittle Sams has written, and 
Messrs. Putnam will publish, a series of books 
describing " The Conquest of Virginia." The first 
volume, to appear this month, is entitled " The 
Forest Primeval: An Account, based on Original 
Documents, of the Indians in that Portion of the 
Continent in whicli was Established the First 
English Colony in America." 

One of the few war books likely to serve a 
definitely constructive purpose is the forthcoming 
volume entitled " Towards a Lasting Settlement," 
in which various fundamental problems relating 
to the war and the future are discussed by Messrs. 
G. Lowes Dickinson, H. N. Brailsford, J. A. Hob- 
son, Vernon Lee, Philip Snowden, M.P., and oth- 
ers. The book is edited by Mr. C. Roden Buxton. 

Some new light is thrown on the life of Sir 
Philip Sidney in the forthcoming memoir by Pro- 
fessor Malcolm W. Wallace, of University College,

Toronto, who points out that Sidney's life pos- 
sesses a new interest for us to-day, " for he, too, 
died in the Netherlands in defence of ideals 
strangely similar to those for which the British 
nation is to-day engaged in a life-and-death 
struggle." 

Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, Professor of the 
Science of Government in Harvard University, is 
the author of " The Monroe Doctrine : An Inter- 
pretation," which Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. 
will publish at once. The writer's aim is to set 
forth what the Monroe Doctrine has meant at 
different times in our history, what it means at the 
present time, and what are the difficulties in the 
way of making it work under present world condi- 
tions. 

The history, aims, and achievements of Jewish 
nationalism are dealt with by several writers in a 
volume entitled, " Zionism and the Jewish Future," 
which is to be published under the editorship of 
Mr. Albert H. Hyamson. The possibilities of the 
movement are demonstrated in the story of what 
has already been accomplished in Palestine in the 
way of founding colonies, schools, banks, and in 
general re-creating a Jewish national life in the 
ancient home of the Jewish people. 

The critical and biographical study of Words- 
worth by Professor George McLean Harper, al- 
ready announced for publication in England, will 
appear in this country 7 under the imprint of 
Messrs. Scribner. Among other forthcoming im- 
portations of this house are : " The Russian Cam- 
paign, April to August, 1915," by Mr. Stanley 
Washburn ; " In Russian Turkestan," by Miss 
Annette M. B. Meakin ; and " England's Guar- 
antee to Belgium and Luxemburg," by Messrs. 
C. P. Danger and H. T. J. Norton. 

An extended work on " The Iconography of 
Manhattan Island," in the preparation of which 
Mr. I. N. Phelps Stokes has long been engaged, is 
announced for early issue. The work is to be pro- 
fusely illustrated by reproductions of rare and 
interesting paintings, drawings, prints, maps, and 
documents in the public and private collections of 
America and Europe which relate to the history 
and development of Manhattan Island, from the 
earliest times down to the Hudson-Fulton cele^bra- 
tion. The work will be published by Mr. Robert 
H. Dodd, of New York, who expects to issue the 
first volume early in December. The edition will 
be limited, with a small number of copies on 
Japan paper. 

In announcing the publication this month of 
his Doves Press edition of Wordsworth's " The 
Prelude," Mr. Cobden-Sanderson makes the fol- 
lowing statement : " This Book is the last which 
will be published in English at The Doves Press. 
It will be followed by the final edition of The 
Catalogue Raisonne of the Books published at the 
Press, and, if a sufficient number of subscribers 
be obtained, by the long promised collection of 
Goethe's Gedichte, which I have already selected 
and arranged. This I hope to publish and so bring 
to an end the scheme of Books which I had 
planned on issuing to my subscribers my farewell 



to them and to the Press in 1913. . . On the pub- 
lication of the Gedichte the Press will be closed." 

Another vacant chair in the French Academy is 
now to be filled, owing to the death, on October 25, 
of Paul Hervieu, novelist and playwright with a 
considerable list of successful works to his credit, 
though he was but in the prime of life when he 
died. Born at Neuilly, Sept. 2, 1857, he was edu- 
cated in Paris, chose the law as a profession, and 
practised in the court of appeals for a short time; 
was also for a brief space a secretary of embassy; 
but by the time he was twenty-five found his true 
vocation, and had ever since been producing nov- 
els and plays with a facility that might have meant 
inferior work in one less gifted. A half-score of 
works of prose fiction, with a dozen stage produc- 
tions, form the most notable product of his pen. 
His fame, with his plays and novels, has gone 
abroad to other lands, including our own, where 
he is known to theatre-goers and readers. 

Green's " Short History of the English People " 
is to be included, in two volumes, in the next 
batch of twelve additions to " Everyman's Li- 
brary." The work has been edited for this pur- 
pose, with an Introduction, by Mr. L. Cecil Jane, 
and will include an appendix by Mr. R. P. Farley, 
bringing the narrative to the beginning of the 
present war, and there will be maps in color and 
black and white. Among the remaining volumes 
which Messrs. Dutton are adding to the series are : 
" Edwin Drood," with an Introduction by Mr. 
G. K. Chesterton, completing the " Everyman " 
edition of Dickens; Gogol's "Dead Souls," trans- 
lated by Mr. C. J. Hogarth ; Balzac's " Ursule 
Mirouet," with an Introduction by Dr. George 
Saintsbury ; Newman's " On the Scope and Nature 
of University Education " and " Christianity and 
Scientific Investigation," with an Introduction by 
Dr. Wilfrid Ward ; and Ibsen's " Lady Inger of 
Ostraat," " Love's Comedy," and " The League of 
Youth," translated by Mr. R. Farquharson Sharp. 

An immediately forthcoming volume (the 
twelfth) of " The Cambridge History of English 
Literature " forms the first of three volumes deal- 
ing with the literature of the nineteenth century, 
which will bring the History to a close. The open- 
ing chapter is devoted to Sir Walter Scott, by 
Dr. T. F. Henderson. Professor F. W. Moorman 
contributes a chapter on Byron; Professor C. H. 
Herford on Shelley, as well as another chapter on 
Keats; Dr. George Saintsbury has chapters on 
"Lesser Poets, 1790-1837," and "The Landors, 
Leigh Hunt, De Quincey"; Mr. Harold Child on 
" Lesser Novelists," and Jane Austen ; Sir A. W, 
Ward deals with " Historians : Writers on An- 
cient and Early Ecclesiastical History"; Profes- 
sor W. D. Howe, of the University of Indiana, 
has a chapter on Hazlitt; Mr. A. Hamilton 
Thompson on Lamb; the Hon. Arthur R. D. 
Elliot on " Reviews and Magazines in the Early 
Years of the Nineteenth Century"; the Ven. 
W. H. Button on " The Oxford Movement " ; the 
Rev. F. E. Hutchinson on " The Growth of Liberal 
Theology"; and Sir John E. Sandys a closing 
chapter on " Scholars, Antiquaries, and Bibliog- 
raphers."

THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW 



From Lord Bryce : 

"The whole REVIEW is, so to speak, almost too good for a serial. There is matter 
in it for the making of books of permanent value. . . . What strikes me most in it 
all through is that it is fresh, not hackneyed or conventional, and that it is full of think- 
ing, written not because something has to be said, but because the writers have some- 
thing to say. " 

From Professor A. S. Johnson, Cornell: 

"If anybody had told me, a year ago, that we should have, in this country, a maga- 
zine as good as this, I'd have spurned him as a false prophet." 

From Professor William Lyon Phelps : 

"I am enjoying THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW immensely, and greatly admire it; it is 
a proof that wit, originality, and charm may all be successfully employed on the side 
of the angels." 

From Professor Paul Shorey: 

"I read with interest a larger proportion of THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW, I think, 
than of any other periodical." 

The Nation : 

"Solid substance and brilliant execution. . . To such a quarterly The Nation 
extends the right hand of fellowship." 

American Review of Reviews : 

"An instant and deserved success." 

London Times: 

"THE UNPOPULAR REVIEW, . . is welcomed here."

THE HOUSE ON HENRY STREET 

The story of THE HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT on the east side of New 
York City, of the transforming miracle that makes American citizens out of the 
emigrants that throng the city's tenements and shops and more. For over 
twenty years this settlement has been a sort of moral galvanic battery of construc- 
tive social ideas. This book fuses the interest of an important contribution to our 
social literature and an absorbing personal narrative.

THE BENT TWIG

WALTER LIPPMANN'S 

THE STAKES OF DIPLOMACY 

By the author of "DRIFT AND MASTERY," etc. $1.25 net. 

Mr. Lippmann makes a proposal which would prevent the emotion of patriotism and 
questions of national prestige becoming involved in the protection of citizens and 
commercial interests in the backward places of the earth. This would do away 
with the prime cause of international friction. A book sure to attract unusual 
attention.

CONSTANTINOPLE 

Old and New 
By H. G. DWIGHT 

"The work has been a labor of love Constantinople is the author's birthplace. He knows 
it as home, and the touch of affection appears on every page. Life high and low, the hut and the 
palace, the marts, the water-front, the retired nooks float gently within our ken under the author's 
guidance, and the story of the 'glory of the East' unfolds gently, informingly, seductively, but 
effectively. One can almost say, after reading the book, I know Constantinople. . . . Few 
books of the kind will prove more satisfying to the mind that would inhale Eastern aroma or the eye 
that delights in knowing things as they are." Literary Digest.

The Fountains of Papal Rome

them with artistic sympathy.

into the legend and romance of the city of the Tiber, and the Churchman who is seeking for sidelights upon

All the World's Impor-

AD all the information up-to-date. You are 
invited as a reader of The Dial to accept for 
inspection a set of the wonderful Every- 
man Encyclopaedia in any binding that 
you may select. 

, You owe it to yourself to make the acquaintance 
of this epoch-making work. Just think of it! A 
great, authoritative, up-to-the-minute encyclo- 
paedia covering the whole range of human knowledge 
all in twelve beautiful bound volumes, each one of 
which can be handled and read with the ease of a 
small novel. 

You would not have believed it possible, but the 
thing has been done and thousands acclaim the 
achievement, and literary critics of the greatest 
papers and magazines in the world unite in hearty 
commendation of this really sensational achieve- 
ment. "Truly astonishing," says the Baltimore 
Sun. "More up-to-date than the larger works," 
says the New York Sun. "No work one-quarter 
as good and useful for a man in my position, " says 
a leading publisher. "A veritable mine of informa- 
tion," says the Philadelphia Public Ledger. "If a 
friend had but $6 to spend for books of reference, 
I would advise him to spend the entire sum on the 
Everyman," says the editor of the Kentucky Post. 
"Here is just what I can afford, just what I can 
carry around with me," says a college professor. 

The Everyman supplies exactly what is required 
by the family that needs an encyclopaedia, but can- 
not afford, and really does not require, the ponder- 
ous high-priced works. The Doctor, Teacher, 
Lawyer, Banker, College Man every person who

reads will recognize in these twelve compact, 
pocket-fitting books an indispensable, modern, 
intellectual tool; the acme of reference efficiency. 

Every classroom needs a set, every business office, 
every home. No student at college should be with- 
out this compact, ready information on literary, 
scientific, historical, political subjects. No edu- 
cator but can use it profitably in the daily work at 
school or college. No parent with growing children 
who "ask questions" should fail to put the Every- 
man on the Christmas tree. No woman who is 
seeking broader culture should fail to own it. No 
alert business man should fail to have it on his desk. 

Remember these points. It is a distinct effort, 
and means loss of efficiency to look up matters while 
you work in the bigger volumes on your book shelves. 
It is easy and efficient with the Everyman which can 
be right at your elbow, occupying only a foot of 
space seven inches high, on desk, table, shelf or in 
your trunk. You can always have the Everyman 
with you wherever and whenever you need it. 

And everyone of you can have the Everyman 
Encyclopaedia now, instead of "some day," as you 
say about the big, expensive encyclopedias. For 
the price has been fixed to place the Everyman 
within easy reach of all. Only the nation-wide 
demand for such a reference work, only the large 
production, could make these prices possible. 

The set of twelve volumes in red cloth with gold 
stamping is SIX Dollars ($6.00). Volumes open 
flat; carefully sewed for hard use; type clear and 
readable; paper thin, opaque and tough; tinted 
tops. The set with box reinforced in cloth at $8.00. 
In full red leather with gilt tops and gold stamping 
on side and back at $10.00 the set. Quarter pig- 
skin at $12.00 the set. 

In accepting our invitation you need send no 
money now, unless you prefer to remit immediately 
with coupon. But do not fail to mail the coupon

Roads 

By Richard LeGallienne 

12. 1.50 


The author has won for himself a place in the front rank of 
essayists, for subject as well as for style and grace of expres- 
sion. This new volume discloses fresh viewpoints of familiar 
things. The book is full of keen comments on contemporary 
ideals and misconceptions, but embraces much, too, that 
transcends the present and includes the past. Here are 
essays vital to the lover of nature, and essays of assured appeal 
to the student of manners and men.

as the Ambassador from the Mikado's Empire to the Court 
of St. James, had a large measure of responsibility for the 
shaping of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. His verbatim 
account of the diplomatic play of forces gives a very clear 
impression of the conduct of this important affair of state.

Two Books of Intimate Interest to Dl AL Readers 



The Everyday Life of 
Abraham Lincoln 

By FRANCIS F. BROWNE 

Late Editor of "The Dial" 
Compiler of " Bugle Echoes," " Golden Poems," etc. 

12. With Portraits. $1.75 
The original edition of this book was published 
about twenty years after Lincoln's death, and 
has continued to attract attention among the 
growing circle of Lincoln's admirers. 

This book brings Lincoln the man, not Lincoln 
the tradition, very near to us. It embodies the 
reminiscences of over five hundred contem- 
poraries and friends of Lincoln reminiscences 
which were gathered largely at first hand. 

" This book gives the everyday reader a clearer, more com- 
plete and intimate picture of Lincoln the man than may 
be had from any other biography." Oregon Journal. 

"Stands out as a notable achievement ... an 
intimate and valuable picture of Lincoln the man, which 
can not be found in the many biographies ordinarily con- 
structed. " Phila. Public Ledger. 

"Collecting the most salient features of Lincoln's char- 
acter and weaving them into an entertaining story and 
record." Boston Transcript. 

"A valuable volume for any shelf of Lincoln books 
. a different type of book from all other lives of 
Lincoln. " Boston Transcript. 



Incense and Iconoclasm 

By CHARLES LEONARD MOORE 

12. $1.50 
General Morris Schaff writes the author as follows: 

" Do you know that this last book will put you 
in the very first rank, if not in the lead, of our 
critics on literature? It is altogether the firmest, 
broadest, and has the most marching step, so to 
speak, of anything that has appeared, and should 
bring you great honor, especially from students 
and teachers of literature, for no one can read 
your essays and not be conscious of a new light 
on the pages of the writers whose works and 
genius you have dealt with." 

"The author has written arrestingly regarding many 
subjects fundamental to literature and life." Buffalo 
Express. 

"For a score of years his nicely weighed and admirably 
judicious essays in miniature upon literary topics have 
been one of our outstanding features." The Dial. 

"A charming conversational style, pleasing enough to 
cover his evident seriousness, and he has ideas, two wel- 
come qualities little found in the work of our American 
essayists struggling to appear original under the influence 
of a De Quincey or a Hazlitt. " The Bellman. 

"Mr. Moore is pleasingly erudite. His range of sub- 
jects is broad. His style is alert and interesting. " Syr a* 
cuse Post-Standard. 

"A sparkle of diction that makes his pages a delight. " 
The Argonaut. 



The Golden Slipper 

And Other Problems for Violet Strange 
By ANNA KATHARINE GREEN 

12. Frontispiece in color by A rthur I. Keller. $1.35. 

The famous author of "The Leaven worth 
Case," "Marked Personal," "That Affair Next 
Door," "Lost Man's Lane," etc., has 
created a character quite different from 
the usual "master detective," and one 
which will be eagerly accepted by the 
multitude of readers who are always on 
the lookout for "something good" in 
detective fiction. 

This solver of mysteries is an attrac- 
tive young girl, but one of the most dominant 
and forceful figures in detectivedom since the 
advent of Sherlock Holmes. 

The mysteries Violet Strange is set to solve 
are so bound together as to offer the sustaining 
interest of one long story. 

A Rogue by Compulsion 

By VICTOR BRIDGES 

Author of "Jetsam," " The Man From Nowhere," etc. 

12. Color Frontis. $1.35 
A story all action. From the moment when 
Mr. Lyndon, the wrongly imprisoned hero, leaps 
over the wall and falls to safety, narrowly escap- 
ing the pursuing shot, to the time when he re- 
ceives the thanks of the nation, as the joint 
captor of a band of spies, with whom he has, in 
ignorance of their real motives, worked in en- 
forced association, one thrill follows another. 



The Promise 




A Story of 

The Great Northwest 
By JAMES B. HENDRYX 

12. Picture Wrapper. $1.35 
A tale of a strong man's regeneration; the 
transformation of " Broadway Bill " 
Carmody.millionaire's son, rounder and 
sport, whose drunken sprees have finally 
overtaxed the patience of his father 
and the girl, into a Man, clear-eyed and 
clean-lived. 

From New York the scene shifts to 
the lumber camps of the Northwest, 
where strong men work, and where the hero fights 
wolves and humans as dangerous as they 
where he struggles against heavy odds; where he 
undergoes terrific hardships and bravely meets 
and passes many dangers and where he earns 
the title of "The Man Who Could Not Die." 

Mid-Summer Magic

Author of "The Uplands," etc.

An elemental story laid in the Cotswold 
Hills a story full of deep-lodged passion,

A red-blooded story redolent of the hills, fields,

SAFETY FIRST 

A Book-Disinfecting Machine 

Something New for Libraries, Schools, etc. 

Wm. H. Rademaekers, the well-known Library 
Binder of Newark, N. J., has for many years 
noted that libraries and schools need to safe- 
guard employees, pupils and borrowers of books. 

He has invented and patented a book-disin- 
fecting machine, which enables him to disinfect 
without the slightest injury every page of a 
book after it is rebound. 

BOOKS CARRY DISEASE GERMS 

Libraries and schools can now have their 
books rebound, and at the same time disinfected, 
without extra cost. 

Thirty years of experience in all branches of 
bookbinding have taught me what binding is most 
suitable for hard use in libraries and schools. 

I supervise all my work. My bindery is 
always open for visitors. 

Send me two works of fiction prepaid and I 
will rebind same, one in Lib. Buckram and one 
in Half Leather, and send them to you that you 
may see samples of our work. 

I return all work four weeks after receiving it. 
Ask for price list. Give us a trial.

SOME PRESS NOTICES OF VOLUME 1 

" We find ourselves profoundly impressed with this en- 
terprise, and shall follow its development with keenest 
interest." The Theological Quarterly. 

" Students of the Reformation may look forward to a 
valuable addition to their resources." The Nation. 

" The editors have accomplished with skill and discretion 
the difficult task of turning Luther's highly idiomatic Ger- 
man into illuminating English, and the various treatises 
and discussions are preceded by thoughtful and ably-writ- 
ten introductions." The Philadelphia Press. 

" We have here a wisely thought-out and well-executed 
plan, far surpassing anything that has been attempted 
heretofore in the way of giving what is immortal of Luther 
to the English-speaking world." The Christian Herald. 

" The translators have done the work well. Ten such 
volumes will do much to bring into the daylight one of the 
simplest and most earnest of Christians and one of the 
widest-hearted men of his or any age." The Sunday School 
Times.

The N. Y. Times says: 

"This work, written by a

summed up as a standard book 
of information for the general 
public. It is exceedingly simple 
in its statements of basic prin- 
ciple, explains the principles of 
color, form, balance, the uses of 
various textures, scales and 
motifs. He goes into the vexing 
'little things' of modern house 
decoration and takes up the 
famous 'periods.' 'Interior Dec- 
oration' is for the average house- 
holder who wants to learn the 
principles on which a living place

very beautifully illustrated."

France at War 

On the Frontier of 
Civilization 

By RUDYARD KIPLING 

Here is the French soldier in 
action here the spirit of France 
resurgent described by a master 
hand. Mr. Kipling's observa- 
tions have created a profound 
impression in England for they 
have brought home to the 
English as nothing else has done 
the tremendous sacrifices of her 
ally, and her fortitude in war. 
Included in the volume is Mr. 
Kipling's poem "France" which 
is peculiarly fitting to the vol- 
ume though written two years 
ago. In it he expresses in stir- 
ring words the new spirit of 
France.

OUR AMERICAN WONDERLANDS is not only 
an interesting and instructive volume for current 
reading, but a valuable and permanent addition to 
any library. It is beautifully illustrated. 

THE CORNER STONE is an inexpensive little 
volume, but remarkably handsome and eminently 
suitable for gift purposes. It's a plain little story 
with smiles and heart-tugs in it; and the spirit of 
Christmas inspiring the whole. 

BEYOND THE FRONTIER is rattling good histo- 
rical romance. It's of especial interest to dwellers 
in the middle west, being a story of Fort St. Louis 
(Starved Rock) on the Illinois River in the time of 
LaSalle and Tonty. 

HORSE SENSE is the latest collection of Walt 
Mason's Wit and Wisdom. "The High Priest" of 
Horse Sense is George Ade's characterization of 
the man whose prose poems are world famous. 

THE GREEN HALF-MOON is a lively yarn of 
thrilling adventure in the Orient, with a pair of 
Americans in the respective roles of Hero and 
Heroine. It concerns a mysterious jewel, the war 
token of the Moslems. 

THE GLAD HAND is a little book of helpful and 
practical discussions of the things of life worth 
while. It preaches the gospel of cheerful optimism, 
and, as Mr. Desmond expresses it, "The noblest type 
of citizen bears upon his shield a glad hand rampant." 

THE FUR TRAIL ADVENTURERS is an ex- 
cellent book to place in a boy's hand. It will gratify 
his natural taste for adventure while teaching him 
self-reliance and a right standard of living. 

ALICE IN WONDERLAND is Lewis Carroll's 
wonderful stories in play form. Children will be 
delighted with the beautiful book just as they were 
with the play itself when it was recently presented.

"JUST A NICE STORY." 

The old-fashioned woman of a generation 
ago used always to be looking for that isle of 
safety in the perilous thoroughfare of current 
fiction which she called the "sweet pretty 
story." Her mother had escaped to it from 
unpleasant writers like Thackeray and George 
Eliot. She herself sought refuge there from 
the deeper distresses of Thomas Hardy, the 
shocking young cynicism of Kipling, and 
those new importations, from France and Rus- 
sia of the strange thing called realism, which 
showed only too plainly what a dreadful state 
foreigners must be in. A quaint figure now : 
and yet not all her daughters have outgrown 
her. From the novels of sex, of crime, of 
sophistication, of the supernatured man and 
the denatured woman, they still, in their thou- 
sands, look for relief to the white-and-gold 
volume with the red-haired girl on the cover ; 
and they pass it on, murmuring more or less 
shamefacedly (for it is frightfully unfashion- 
able to be innocent) that it is "just a nice 
story." 

Now the critic, in his crusty moods, or at 
moments when his virility obliges him to cor- 
rect female members of his family, is wont to 
dispose of this kind of commodity as " mush," 
or peradventure " slush." He builds a fence, 
and barbs it stiffly, between true idealism, the 
stuff of which manly life and manly imagina- 
tion are made, and the insipid sentimentalism 
with which the ladies, and the ladylike gen- 
tlemen, love to confound it. But even the 
critic, unless he is fairly frozen in among his 
categories, must have his more responsive or 
relenting moments. In these days, when 
authoresses pride themselves upon being vir- 
ile, it is a relief, now and then, to own the 
soft impeachment of parlor romance, to taste 
the lucent syrups of the sentimentalist. 
Granted that the "pretty" story is often 
sickish to a robust appetite; nevertheless has 
it not its proper place in the diet? There 
is a balance to be kept: the gamijiess of the 
game course, the altitude of the cheese, de- 
mand offsets at the other extreme of the 
palate. 

What is the genesis of the nice story? I 
suggest that it is time for some budding Ph.D.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 25 



to make a serious study of it (very serious it 
must be, with tables and diagrams) for the 
academic mart. Unless she were very ambi- 
tious, she might make shift with a start in 
Sanskrit or Pali literature. The tale of Ruth 
would edge her along through the somewhat 
grim Hebrew pages. Greece, handled with 
discretion, would respond more liberally to 
her coaxing hand. Rome, I fear, would hold 
off a little ; sweetness and prettiness were not 
much in the Roman line. For the middle 
ages, the tale of Griselda hangs on the peril- 
ous edge of tragedy ; but the lady is the real 
sort, and everything turns out right in the 
end; Boccacio could be as pretty as you 
please when he was not happening to be 
naughty. The days of Elizabeth were not too 
spaciously masculine to produce several of 
the nicest stories in the world. Rosalind was 
prototype of how many hundreds of virtuous 
daring heroines? Viola, her damask cheek 
not more than becomingly ravaged by con- 
cealment, her humor (as Rosalind's is not) 
always subject to her sentiment, is nearer 
the sweet pretty type, while Perdita and 
Miranda are perfect embodiments of it. There 
was not much chance in the days of Dry- 
den and Congreve. The eighteenth century 
trickled its damper sentiment through the 
channel of the so-called Eastern Tale, that 
queer concoction of sickly sentiment and pre- 
posterous action, concerning persons with 
names which no longer figure in print except 
on the covers of cigarette-boxes. And of 
course there was "Paul and Virginia," not 
too tragic in the end for the lachrymose taste 
of the time. 

This is all very sketchy and doubtless inac- 
curate, and will, I fear, only suggest to our 
aspirant for academic honors the way in 
which the thing ought not to be done. Any- 
how, I am sure she will find more prettiness 
and niceness in the nineteenth century than 
in all the others put together. Of course the 
lachrymose habit persisted in its earlier years 
yes, well into its middle. If you will look 
into any of those quaint annuals which flour- 
ished in the forties and fifties, the Tokens, 
and Souvenirs, and Books of Gems, you will 
observe that the happy ending as a requisite 
of the nice story is a relatively modern affair. 
People loved to have Little Nell die by inches, 
under a pink light. Poets were encouraged to 
warble about their pleasing woe and their 
cherished despair. It was at least as popular 



to kill a pair of lovers in each other's arms 
(preferably by lightning) as to land them at 
the altar. But a little later in Victoria's reign 
fashions changed, melancholy ceased to be a 
preferred pleasure; the kiss curtain, as they 
say in dramatic circles, came in once more. 
The light that never was on sea or land was 
spotted upon the happy pair at that supreme 
instant of tableau when happiness has not 
begun to be menaced by the grocer, the cradle, 
or the third member of the triangle. We saw 
them married, and we left it to them to be 
happy ever after. However dismally, in real 
life, we might be bored by the young lady 
who has just struck a final balance between 
her skirts and her back hair, or the young 
gentleman who has just "graduated," we, or 
the females of our species, were well content 
to philander with them for a season, in print. 
For they are youth, ourselves as we are, 
have been, or might have been. Therefore the 
silly and wonderful time that links adoles- 
cence to the hour of mating is the one age of 
man which is of universal interest. 

Hence the enormous and hardly yet dimin- 
ishing popularity of " Little Women." Here, 
if you like, is the nice story, the pretty story, 
the story that leaves a pleasant taste in one's 
mouth. If it is capable of furnishing mate- 
rial, now and then, for " a good cry," and if 
its sentiment is unabashedly Victorian, it 
lived and still lives chiefly in an atmosphere 
of harmless laughter. Miss Alcott's world is 
an undergraduate world without cynicism, a 
" flapper " world which somehow escapes silli- 
ness, the world of immortal youth at some- 
thing approaching its best. That world has 
its rightful limitation. When its young fig- 
ures have passed in pairs up the church steps, 
and we have lingered a moment to hear the 
strains of Mendelssohn or " The Voice that 
Breathed o'er Eden," we may well let the 
curtain fall. We have had the cream of life, 
never mind about the skimmed milk. For 
our purposes, at least, the hero and heroine, 
having discharged, with the act of mating, 
the supreme function of youth, have rightly 
ceased to be. 

Against this view of life let the realists 
rage. Turning an ingenuous ear, we simply 
perceive that they are talking about some- 
thing else. Life happens to interest them 
chiefly in other phases. They are willing to 
admit that puberty and the act of mating are 
episodes of physiological and racial import;

but they find more absorbing themes in the 
physiology or psychology of marriage as a 
state, in the devious conduct of the "ever 
after" if, indeed, they condescend to treat 
life in themes rather than in slices or in 
hunks ! 

Well, there is no real matter for argument 
here, is there? It all comes down to the old 
brass tacks of preference. And one is not 
invariably a silly ass because he fails to be a 
curmudgeon. Some people like to grit their 
teeth and stare at things, others like to shut 
their eyes and dream of them. It is a ques- 
tion of mood, with a great many of us. The 
sweet pretty story, reduced to its elements, is 
merely a sort of easy and soothing substitute 
for poetry, prepared for what used to be 
called the boudoir. It is a literature for the 
emotional toilet, and very useful in restoring 
(for the moment at least) the bloom and 
perfume of life. 

In its purest form, I have said, it deals 
with young love and its immediate conse- 
quences the license, the ring, and the mar- 
riage-peal. This article is warranted to 
soothe the tenderest emotional cuticle. But 
there are variants. One of them pushes the 
action back into infancy, and represents the 
little child (in a blue sash and gold ringlets) 
leading them. Nowadays, to be sure, she 
often leads them by the nose. The old theory 
of her as an influence powerful through its 
very weakness and innocence is exploded. 
She is now very much " in the know," the 
family oracle and censor ex officio. It is she 
who persuades poor father to give up playing 
auction for money which she can so ill afford ; 
it is she who reveals to dear mother that it is 
her own fault poor father is drifting away; 
it is she who tells grandfather just what she 
thinks of him for his treatment of big brother. 
And father and mother and grandfather are 
all tickled to pieces, when they come to think 
it over. Or it is the fine manly little fellow 
who, not yet in his teens, supports his wid- 
owed mother and orphaned sisters, and stops 
the runaway which is hurling the sash and 
ringlets to their last home, and they are the 
daughter of the President of the Bank, and 
everybody knows the rest. A queer cult of 
precocious love-making is important in this 
kind of yarn. It does not hesitate to extend 
the range of mating-sentiment clear below the 
bounds of adolescence. 



Another popular variant of the pretty 
story owes its fascination to its activity in 
pushing this same sentiment along in the 
other direction. I recall a story hailed enthu- 
siastically the other day by lovers of the 
sweet pretty. It was about an aged pair, 
wed for many years, who call each other 
Pelleas and Etarre, and whose chief occupa- 
tion turns out to be making eyes at each other 
and otherwise going through the exercises 
proper to a normal and healthy -calf-love. I 
thought it rather indecent, myself an ex- 
treme instance of the kind of thing which I 
suppose represents a reaction against the sor- 
did or squalid aspects of marriage as shown 
up by the gloomier realists. The reaction is 
legitimate enough, up to a certain point. The 
natural way to see a thing is with the naked 
eye. But if some people are going to use a 
glass, and to insist on looking through the 
uncomplimentary end of it, there will natu- 
rally be other people to reverse the process. 
If some people are going to be forever telling 
us that all of the sweet sentiment of life van- 
ishes during the honeymoon, other people are 
sure to try to persuade us that none of it need 
ever escape or be transmuted. 

There are a goodly number of writers now 
producing nice stories along this line, stories 
eagerly or wistfully piping the tune of domes- 
tic sentiment. Were not we, after all, mis- 
taken in our readiness to bury romance at the 
altar? Has youth, in truth, such a monopoly 
of heart-interest? Do home and mother 
necessarily mean haircloth and a red shawl? 
By no means, cry these gospellers any more 
than they mean a bridge-table and a make-up. 
Look ! here is happiness in your thirties and 
forties. Here is the kind of fiction in which 
tired and middle-aged women may find a 
sweet flattery, which let no man grudge them. 
Here is no pretty fancy out of the faded past, 
but a dream based upon real life as they 
know it. It is a vision of humdrum colored 
by romance: themselves and their surround- 
ings bathed in a rosy light of sentiment; the 
everyday worjid of housewife and commuter 
blown upon by consciously wholesome airs of 
"idealism"; a world, in short, where being 
good is really being happy, and loving one's 
neighbor the popular sport. 

Yes, it is easy enough for us to make fun 
of this kind of commodity it is not the lit- 
erature upon which men's souls are fed. But 
it has its function. If we are going to look 



474 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 25 



upon the world as it is not, we may quite as 
profitably see it the color of a rosebank as the 
color of a dunghill. After all, daydreams are 
better medicine for tired hearts than night- 
mares are. We may safely let mother have 
her sweetmeat. Lord knows, we shall have 
plenty of stories left that are neither sweet 
nor pretty nor nice ! H> w> BOYNTON . 



LITERARY AFFAIRS IN FRANCE. 

MAXIM GORKY'S SON, AND OTHER COMING EURO- 
PEAN LECTURERS IN AMERICA. M. JULES Bois's 
NEW NOVEL. THE LATE REMY DE GOURMONT. 
(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

One day last summer when I came into one 
of the smaller wards of our American Ambu- 
lance at Neuilly, where I go afternoons to 
write letters for the wounded, I noticed a 
little table alongside of that of the nurse, 
heaped with books and writing materials. A 
few days later I found seated behind this 
table M. Zenovi Pechkoff, Gorky's son, a ner- 
vous, energetic young man of perhaps twenty- 
five, whose left arm had been amputated close 
up at the shoulder, for he has been for many 
months a soldier in the first regiment of the 
French Foreign Legion. Perhaps I may say 
in passing that my own son is also a member 
of this regiment, which has seen some of the 
hardest fighting on the western front. M. 
Peehkoff, who has been decorated for bravery 
and has an honorable discharge from the 
army, is now residing near Genoa, and is 
engaged in delivering lectures in Italy on the 
war and writing out for publication his im- 
pressions and experiences at the front, these 
latter being of no ordinary nature. " I have 
had an informal invitation," he tells me, "to 
lecture in the United States ; and if the offer 
takes definite shape, I will go." I seized the 
opportunity at one of our meetings to ask 
M. Pechkoff if there was any truth in the 
rather surprising statement contained in 
"Who's Who" for the present year, that 
Gorky had " enlisted in the Russian army," 
and his reply was much what I expected, 
" Gorky has not only not enlisted in the Rus- 
sian army, but is hard at work at his usual 
literary occupations in a town in Finland." 

Another possible early foreign lecturer in 
America is the Belgian publicist, Professor 
Celestin Demblon, who always writes proudly 
after his name, " Depute de Liege." He will 
be remembered perhaps less to his credit 
as the author of the theory that Lord Rutland 
was the writer of the Shakespeare plays. The 



fact is that he was on the point of starting on 
an American lecture tour on this subject when 
the war broke out. " But I may go over when 
the peace comes," he said to me in Paris last 
spring. M. Demblon is now in London nego- 
tiating for an English translation of his 
magnum opus, "Lord Rutland est Shake- 
speare" and "L'Auteur d'Hamlet et son 
Monde," while engaged in seeing through the 
press, also in English dress, his latest book, 
"La Guerre a Liege." M. Demblon was in 
the noble little city all through the memorable 
month of August of last year, and his family 
is still hedged in there. 

And before I dismiss the subject of Euro- 
peans lecturing in America, I should add that 
M. Jules Bois is just back from a several 
months' sojourn in the United States, where 
I understand he had a really remarkable suc- 
cess on the platform and in drawing-rooms. 
" I am going back shortly," he wrote me from 
Bordeaux on landing last month, which 
shows that he feels that he had a good time 
there. Since then I have spent a most inter- 
esting afternoon with him, when he gave me 
a resume of his next novel, " The Woman 
who Killed," which Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
are to bring out this season in New York. 
The book, written especially for the American 
public and based largely on M. Bois's expe- 
riences on your side of the Atlantic, will, if 
published in France, have quite another and 
more commonplace title, " L'Impitoyable." 
In fact it is in the United States that the 
volume will probably attract the most readers, 
and I venture to predict that the number will 
be large, for it is unquestionably a powerful 
story, which will certainly provoke contro- 
versy. The heroine, Mrs. Cynthia Maitland, 
"the type of the super-lady," as M. Bois 
describes her, first appears on the scene as a 
nurse at the American Ambulance already 
referred to. The two other chief characters 
are Frenchmen, Michel d'Aulnieres, the 
hero of the tale, an officer who has invented a 
remarkable gun ; and Lavisor, " a great mor- 
alist, who has become a sort of mystic because 
of the war." The development of the per- 
sonality of Mrs. Maitland is the feature of 
the book; and though she certainly will not 
wholly please the New Woman, the New 
Woman will find not a little comfort in the 
fact that it is the heroine who stands forth 
the stronger, and the hero the weaker, vessel. 
Though the late Remy de Gourmont, who 
died at the very end of last month, never lec- 
tured in America and never dreamed of doing 
so, he was, at a certain period of his life, 
quite "at home" in some of the drawing- 
rooms of the Paris American Colony. During 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



475 



the last half of the eighties, he was par- 
ticularly assiduous at the house of a wealthy 
American widow who had three or four very- 
pretty marriageable daughters. He there 
sounded his title of Marquis for all that it 
was worth, probably for more than it was 
worth, and was even seen waltzing with the 
hostess's girls. I will never forget this waltz- 
ing. Remy de Gourmont had a short, rather 
stoutish body, was awkward in his move- 
ments, wore clothes without any cut, always 
had his trousers "'up for high tide," as a 
young American said, and then went whirling 
around like a top, French fashion, without 
ever reversing. 

All these strange things, doubly strange in 
the Remy de Gourmont whom we knew later, 
happened before he was known as a writer; 
and he was brought into this stylish circle by 
his bonne amie of that day, who became his 
faithful Egeria at the end, a pleasant niece 
of the well-known French sculptor Clesinger 
(1814-84), son-in-law of George Sand, and 
whose fine statue of his famous mother-in-law 
is one of the art treasures of the foyer of the 
Theatre f ranc.ais. This very slight connection 
with Nohant and its group gave a dash of 
literary color to the early life of Remy de 
Gourmont, even before he began himself to 
write. But what suddenly made him a full- 
fledged man of letters was one of his first 
contributions to the " Mercure de France," of 
which, by the way, he was one of the eleven 
founders, and where all his volumes have been 
published, for the "Mercure" has a book- 
publishing department, and where he wrote 
almost uninterruptedly for twenty-five years, 
the last article from his pen appearing there 
on the very day of his funeral. In 1891 he 
there aired his views on Patriotism, and 
boldly declared that he cared no more for 
Alsace-Lorraine than for the ashes of his 
cigarette. Thereupon the ultra-patriotic li- 
brarian of the National Library, where M. de 
Gourmont was one of the assistants, and 
where he might have continued down to the 
present day engaged in passing out books to 
the public, ruthlessly discharged him. Yet 
Remy de Gourmont was at bottom a good 
enough patriot, as is sufficiently proved by his 
book, "Pendant 1'Orage," issued recently by 
Champion. Furthermore, his article was 
really a protest against the braggings of Paul 
Deroulede and his group, who were always 
bent on plunging France into a war with 
Germany, with what result we see only too 
clearly to-day. 

So, to use a vulgar but expressive phrase, 
the over-zealous director of the National Li- 
brary kicked Remy de Gourmont up into the 



galaxy of contemporary French authors, 
where he has become one of the most brilliant 
stylists of the present generation. His 
French is clear-cut and pure, and he was 
always sure of himself. M. Andre Fontainas, 
however, said to me very truly as we left the 
church after the funeral: "He was not an 
inventor of style, a finder of images, a turner 
of happy phrases, which create new relations 
between ideas by means of words." Nor does 
this delicate Belgian poet think that " because 
of its style would one, after reading a para- 
graph of Remy de Gourmont, be likely to 
exclaim, ' That's de Gourmont,' as one can 
say, 'That's Voltaire, or Renan, or Flaubert.' " 
The social change that came over Remy de 
Gourmont when he rose to the rank of a lead- 
ing writer should also be pointed out. When 
he stopped dancing in the American Colony, 
he shut his door on society and practically 
never " went out " again. The last time I saw 
him, several years ago, was when I called on 
him in his plain, huddled-up, bachelor quar- 
ters in the old Rue des Saints-Peres. The 
whole place looked like the pictures of those 
ancient astrologers, wrapped in big morning- 
gowns something like Balzac in Falguiere's 
statue in the Avenue Friedland, and buried 
among their books and papers. And how his 
face had changed since the eighties! The 
victim of some skin disease, I believe, his 
features had become really repulsive, and this 
repulsiveness was increased by the remedy 
that the doctors had had recourse to, the 
burning of the cheeks in such a way that they 
were covered with many ugly little scars. 
This physical state alone would have checked 
Remy de Gourmont from entering a drawing- 
room again, even if he had wished to do so, 
which, however, was not the case. While I of 
course admire the intellectual Remy de Gour- 
mont of the post National Library epoch, I 
have always felt a discreet preference for the 
modest, kindly, gentle, young Marquis de 
Gourmont of the ante "Mercure de France"

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE DRAMATIC RENASCENCE is the subject 
of a notable contribution to the current 
" North American Review " from Mr. Thomas 
H. Dickinson, who pays especial tribute to 
Mr. Henry Arthur Jones as a prominent fig- 
ure in this encouraging development. Mr. 
Dickinson joyfully proclaims the rebirth as 
an accomplished fact, and continues: "Be-

ginning with Matthew Arnold's respectful 
words written in ' The Nineteenth Century ' 
for 1879 the first respectful words spoken 
for the modern English drama by an acknowl- 
edged critic of our day the consideration of 
drama has grown more and more familiar 
under the pens of the learned. Augustine 
Birrell, H. D. Traill, W. L. Courtney, Ed- 
mund Gosse, Professor Gilbert Murray are 
but a few of those who have turned from the 
concerns of the scholar to the consideration of 
modern drama. Drama has entered the uni- 
versities of England and America, no longer 
as a species of elocution, or a debased form of 
literary teaching, but as an art that is con- 
nected structurally and by content with the 
interests of our day. Moreover, drama is win- 
ning acceptance in the sisterhood of the arts. 
Arthur Symons applies to the play the same 
delicate criticism that he applies to music and 
painting. Barrie gives up the novel for the 
play. Even Meredith and Hardy and James, 
to mention those of an older generation, tried 
their hands at dramatic composition, and 
Arnold Bennett and John Galsworthy of the 
newer generation are almost as well known 
for their plays as for their novels. The fact 
that the kindly recognition that is coming to 
drama is based no less on what drama is 
expected to do than on what has already been 
performed, quite as much on potential as 
actual achievements, does not diminish the 
significance of the standards of respect that 
have been enforced for an hitherto despised 
art." But there is no happy accident in all 
this; it has come about by well-directed 
effort ; and among the zealous workers for the 
good cause high honor is paid to Mr. William 
Archer in England and Professor Brander 
Matthews in our own country. A review of 
the history of the stage might incline one to 
name the present attitude of scholars and 
writers toward the drama not a renascence, 
a rebirth, but a wholly new and unprece- 
dented manifestation. Has the player's art 
ever before been held in such esteem and 
made the subject of so much serious study? 



BETTER TEXTBOOKS AT LOWER PRICE has been 
the trend for a quarter century or more in 
the great domain of educational literature. 
It is pleasant to be able to name something 
that has not followed the general rule and 
mounted skyward in price. One of the lead- 
ing publishing houses in this field (Messrs. 
Ginn & Co.) issues a readable and instructive 
pamphlet, " Quality and Cost," in which it is 
asserted that this steady decline in price since 
1890 now amounts to more than ten per cent, 
notwithstanding a constant increase in the 



cost of materials and of workmanship in the 
making of this class of books. Competition in 
the business, combined with a wise insistence 
upon the best quality on the part of teachers 
and other school authorities, must be re- 
garded as the cause of this gratifying devel- 
opment. But, as Professor Kittredge has 
publicly declared, the genius of the late Edwin 
Ginn is not to be overlooked in any explana- 
tion of the present high standing and mod- 
erate price of the American school textbook. 
The firm founded by Mr. Ginn in 1867 set up 
and maintained a higher standard in text- 
book-publishing than had been known to most 
of us before that time, or to our fathers and 
grandfathers if our memory goes not quite so 
far back. Significant in this connection are 
certain statistics lately published by the na- 
tional Bureau of Education, showing that, 
contrary to the general impression, our an- 
nual expenditure for schoolbooks is no very 
staggering sum. Seventy-eight and one-third 
cents for each pupil will be found to cover the 
bill and leave a little over; that is, about 
seventeen million dollars, all told, for one 
year, while in the same length of time twenty- 
five million dollars is spent for chewing-gum, 
one hundred and thirty-five million for candy, 
and three hundred twenty-five million for ice- 
cream soda and similar liquid refreshments. 
Emphatic denial of the existence of any text- 
book trust is given by the above-named firm. 
Perhaps so comparatively small a market is 
not thought worth cornering. 

IMAGISM AND PLAGIARISM may be found in 
rather surprising association in the October 
number of " Poetry : A Magazine of Verse." 
The last piece in a group of what are de- 
scribed in the contents list of this issue as 
" three poems by T. S. Eliot " consists of some 
dull data concerning one Miss Nancy Ellicott, 
evidently a person of extraordinary physical 
if not intellectual weight, who " strode across 
the hills and broke them, . . riding to hounds 
over the cow-pasture," and who " smoked and 
danced all the modern dances," while "her 
aunts were not quite sure how they felt about 
it, but they knew that it was modern." (We 
like those aunts, by the way.) This stuff, 
with more of the same sort, is broken up into 
lines of irregular length, each of which begins 
with a capital letter. The old-fashioned 
reader to whom poetry is something more 
than capitalized lines of irregular length, if 
he finds sufficient entertainment in following 
this society item to the end, will be struck at 
once by the closing line, a phrase whose 
genuine poetic quality stands out in vivid 
contrast with the prose wish-wash that pre-

cedes it. " The army of unalterable law," 
there is a familiar ring to that ; and the old- 
fashioned reader will probably not be long in 
identifying it as the closing line, also, of 
Meredith's fine sonnet, " Lucifer in Starlight." 
It would be edifying to have Meredith's own 
comment on this incident, and his opinion of 
the company into which his fastidious muse 
had been forcibly introduced. 



THE FASCINATION OF FORBIDDEN FICTION 

works often to the bookseller's advantage, in- 
asmuch as books banned by the public library 
are likely to enjoy a " boom " at the book- 
shop. Conversely, the removal of previous 
restrictions on novel-reading ought to take 
away also some part of the charm investing 
the interdicted literature. And something of 
this sort has been found to be the case where 
limitations imposed on the circulation of fic- 
tion have been abolished. At the Pratt Insti- 
tute Free Library, for example, the restriction 
of one novel at a time to a card-holder had, as 
almost everywhere else, been the rule until 
five years ago, when two novels at a time 
became the limit. No general demoralization 
following, the bars were further lowered last 
February and, except to borrowers under 
eighteen and also excepting the latest fiction, 
as many novels as are desired have since then 
been at the borrower's disposal. One might 
have expected from the irksomeness of the one- 
novel or the two-novel rule that its annul- 
ment would have greatly increased the fiction 
circulation ; but we learn from the librarian's 
report that no such increase has taken place, 
even in the first few months when, if ever, it 
ought to have been a dizzy delight to stagger 
away with all the thrillers one could hold in 
one's arms. Perhaps now that the charm of 
novelty is rubbed off, the enlarged privilege 
may even beget a loathing for story-books. 
The poster baby familiar to us all will cry 
for the cake of soap just beyond his reach till 
he gets it, and then he won't care for it. 



THE YEAR'S PERIODICAL POETRY receives at 
this time a little earlier than in former 
seasons Mr. William Stanley Braithwaite's 
expert review and criticism. For the twelve 
months ending with September (not with 
December as heretofore) he has examined 
more than thirty publications, quarterly, 
monthly, weekly, and daily, reading fifteen 
hundred poems from five hundred and thirty 
writers, and sifting the "poems of distinc- 
tion " from those of ordinary merit. His 
results are published, as usual, in the Boston 
" Transcript," and show a generous and cor- 
dial attitude toward verse-writers of promise. 



Too long to be counted is his list of " distinc- 
tive" poems, five of which he prints in full 
as the five best of the lot. They are, in the 
assigned order of merit : " Patterns " by Miss 
Amy Lowell, " The Adventurer " by Mr. Odell 
Shepard, " Needle Travel " by Miss Margaret 
French Patton, "The Road mot Taken" by 
Mr. Robert Frost, and "Peter Quince at the 
Clavier" by Mr. Wallace Stevens. Encour- 
aging to poetry's well-wishers is this critic's 
view of the year's product and his outlook 
toward the future. He sees " continued prog- 
ress of the art [of poetry] in the magazines," 
and notes with especial satisfaction "the in- 
crease of critical writing about contemporary 
poets and poetry." Of course every lover of 
poetry likes to be and ought to be his own 
critic and guide, but the well-weighed opinion 
of the professed student of this form of art 
is always more or less interesting and of more 
or less authority. Many will take issue with 
Mr. Braithwaite in his bestowal of highest 
honors upon the vers libre of the Imagist poet 
whose name stands first in the foregoing list ; 
and, fortunately, everyone is at liberty to 
draw up a list to suit himself, an exercise as 
harmless and as inconclusive as naming the 
ten or twenty or hundred best books. Mr. 
Braithwaite's researches are about to be pub- 
lished in full in book form, "Anthology of 
Magazine Poetry and Year Book of American 

Verse for 1915." 



A QUARTER-MILLENNIAL JUBILEE is in prepa- 
ration at Newark (our chief city of that 
name), and "The Newarker" devotes its 
November issue to a proclamation of the great 
event. Otherwise we might have forgotten 
that next year a quarter of a millennium will 
have passed since Robert Treat and his sturdy 
little band of followers from Connecticut 
landed on the banks of the Passaic River and 
founded the city that was destined to have, 
among other things, one of the most promi- 
nent, progressive, and aggressive public libra- 
ries in all America. From May to October, 
1916, the people of Newark are expecting to 
indulge in pageantry, oratory, feasting, and 
rejoicing of divers sorts not uninterruptedly 
for six entire months, we assume, but more 
or less spasmodically, though systematically 
and with befitting dignity. And now, as to 
the literary part of these elaborate prepara- 
tions indicated by the appointment of many 
kinds of committees and other preliminary 
measures : Mr. John Cotton Dana reminds his 
fellow-Newarkers that the rich store of books 
under his charge is there to be drawn upon 
for the better accomplishment of the end in 
view. " Before anything else," he tells them,

"you must learn what kind of a celebration 
it is to be, and who is to run it and how it is

And all this you can learn at the library 
and can take away the information in print, 
and read it. And then you must learn about 
Newark itself, .unless you know it already, and 
the only man who knew it all has moved to 
New York." Until further notice, it appears, 
Mr. Dana's enterprising monthly is to be used 
for celebration purposes by the Committee of 
One Hundred having charge of the great fes- 
tival ; and then the paper is to return to the 
quieter walks of bibliothecal and kindred 

interests. 



OUR DEBT TO THE PATIENT SCRIBE who has 

subordinated himself to the fame of his mas- 
ter is beyond calculation. What should we 
know of Johnson, the real, every-day Johnson, 
had there been no Boswell ? Lost to the world 
would have been the wise sayings of Epicte- 
tus, had not his pupil Arrian preserved them 
for us. jEsop seems to have left no book of 
fables, written by his own hand; or at least 
none has come down to us only the frag- 
mentary records of such versifiers as Babrius 
and Phsedrus. Socrates without a Plato to 
report him to the world would have been all 
but lost to posterity. In like manner, the 
latest and perhaps the best of Lafcadio 
Hearn's productions, his posthumous " Inter- 
pretations of Literature," owes its being to the 
faithful labors of his student hearers at the 
University of Tokio, where these lectures were 
delivered between 1896 and 1902, and where 
they were so fully taken down in the students' 
notebooks from the lecturer's lips (he lectur- 
ing without notes, but slowly, as befitted the 
needs of his Japanese audience) that the 
whole series was afterward reproduced in 
proper shape for publication, and was pre- 
sented to the beloved teacher's literary execu- 
tor. Not many college classes in the western 
world would have taken the pains that these 
young men of Japan evidently took to pre- 
serve intact the lecturer's ipsissima verba. 



THE MOST VOLUMINOUS REFERENCE WORK IN" 

THE WORLD was, before its destruction by fire 
in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the Chinese 
Encyclopaedia Maxima, in 11,100 volumes, 
housed in the Han-Lin College, which fell a 
victim to Boxer fury. Last year two stray 
fragments of this work that seem to have 
escaped incineration made their appearance 
in a London bookshop and were picked up for 
a trifle by someone who afterward lent them 
to the London Library. Only one other prod- 
uct of industrious scholarship comes to mind 



at present as in any degree comparable in 
scope with this Chinese work. The story goes 
that long ago a certain oriental potentate, 
filled with a desire to promote the welfare of 
his people, ordered the wise men of the land 
to prepare an exhaustive history of the hu- 
man race. Accordingly these men of learning 
formed themselves into an academy, elected 
the proper officers, and set about the com- 
pilation of the desired work. After twenty- 
five years of unflagging industry they 
appeared before their sovereign lord accom- 
panied by a train of camels bearing the 
completed history in five hundred formidable 
volumes. Terrified by its mere bulk, the 
monarch ordered an abridgment. Fifteen 
years of labor ensued, after which the surviv- 
ing academicians (a slender body by this 
time) appeared with a fifty-volume epitome 
of their former work. But even this was too 
much for their royal master to think of read- 
ing, and with tears in his aged eyes he begged 
them to abridge the abridgment. Five years 
passed, and then the sole surviving member 
of the academy presented himself, on crutches, 
with one stout volume borne upon the back 
of an ass. But the king, himself on the edge of 
the grave, turned away in despair at sight of 
the huge tome. Thereupon the academician, 
seized with an inspiration, threw down the 
rejected volume and cried to his moribund 
master : " Sire, the history of the human race 
may be summed up in three words, man is 
born, he suffers, he dies." Might not the 
11,100 volumes of encyclopaedic learning have 
been advantageously subjected to some such 
compression ? 

SAFETY FIRST IN JUVENILE LITERATURE is the 
slogan with which all promoters of good read- 
ing for the young folk are expected to make 
the welkin ring during the week beginning 
Nov. 28. In other words, this is to be Safety 
First Juvenile Book Week in the libraries and 
other haunts of young readers, thus appointed 
by the organization of Boy Scouts of America. 
Precautionary measures for the protection of 
the young from the dangers of deleterious lit- 
erature are urged upon librarians, booksellers, 
editors, and others of influence in the book 
world; and attention is especially called to 
the book-lists prepared by the Boy Scouts 
association and furnished to all libraries 
desiring them. These lists, headed "Books 
Boys Like," embrace about three hundred 
carefully selected works, with annotations, 
the selection being based upon reports re- 
ceived from many librarians and booksellers 
throughout the country, and the titles grouped 
in the following three general classes of chief

"ANDROCLES AND THE LION" IN GERMANY, 
acted by a company of interned British civil- 
ians at Ruhleben on the outskirts of Berlin, is 
described as a most entertaining and credita- 
ble performance. But what a curious mixture 
of incongruous elements is presented by the 
whole affair, an old Roman legend, turned 
into a farce by an English playwright of 
Irish birth, acted by a chance assemblage of 
British subjects held in detention on German 
soil, with a stolid Prussian commandant as 
chief spectator, the scene of the strange enter- 
tainment being the grandstand of a disused 
racetrack, and the stage properties, costumes, 
etc., showing a marvellous exercise of ama- 
teur ingenuity and resourcefulness on the 
part of the "scratch" company engaged in 
the difficult undertaking! Full descriptions 
of this theatrical event have been slow in 
making their way to the outside world, but 
we are now assured that the success of the 
performance was such as to elicit from the 
above-named German officer a very polite 
"Danke Ihnen, meine Herren! Aeusserst 
nett ! " But this is by no means the first time 
that Mr. Shaw's genius has evoked German 

applause. 



THE DECEITFULNESS OF APPEARANCES IN 

BOOKS, to those unskilled in looking beneath 
the surface, was well expressed at the late 
annual meeting of the New York Library 
Association by Dr. Slosson, editor of "The 
Independent." With epigrammatic pithiness 
he told his hearers that "the least valuable 
volumes in the library are those with the 
finest bindings; the most valuable are those 
with no bindings at all." To be sure, the 
modern librarian is ever on the alert, dress- 
ing the ranks of his literary regiment and 
keeping their uniforms in good condition, so 
that the most valuable book is now likely to be 
the most recently rebound book ; but the epi- 
gram deserves to stand as it is. Another 
pregnant word from the same speaker was 
this : " The man who needs the library most 
is the one who draws a book with as much 
reluctance as he draws a revolver." Never- 
theless it remains true, epigram apart, that 
the man who most readily draws his revolver 
is the very one who most needs the civilizing 
influence of the library. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

No one would be better pleased than I if your 
correspondent, Mr. John L. Hervey, could per- 
suade us that William Cullen Bryant remained, 
throughout his long life, " true to his vision " as 
an artist and righteously jealous of his fame. But 
I submit that Mr. Hervey's indignant defence of 
the "mighty dead," as contained in your issue of 
Oct. 28, does not establish his case. 

Mr. Hervey asks, " Who was the very vague 
' publisher ' who made the preposterous state- 
ment?" that Bryant, during his later life, was 
known to " the trade " as " the great national 
tone-imparter," because he was willing to sell his 
name and portrait as the author of books he did 
not write. Because my informant died last year 
I have been reluctant to mention his name, but 
perhaps this reticence is a mistake. He was John 
Denison Champlin, long in the employ of Charles 
Scribner's Sons, and the chief author, or com- 
piler, of their " Cyclopedia of Painters and Paint- 
ings " and " Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians," 
and, I believe, other such works. Mr. Champlin's 
characterization of the poet as a " tone-imparter," 
and the facts he related in support of it, were at 
the time a great shock to my youthful mind. And 
I find nothing in Mr. Hervey's long letter to con- 
tradict the facts or allay the shock. 

Mr. Hervey presents absolutely nothing to dis- 
prove the charge that the " Family Library of 
Poetry and Song, Edited by William Cullen 
Bryant," which is popularly known as " Bryant's 
Collection of Poetry and Song," was not actually 
edited by Bryant at all; or the other charge that 
" Bryant's Popular History of the United States " 
was not actually written by Bryant. On the con- 
trary, he admits the truth of the second charge, 
and tries to cover up the first in nearly a column 
of vague talk and personal denunciation of the 
accuser. 

Let us study Bryant's own words. In the 
"Editor's Introduction" to the "Library," the 
poet naively writes: "At the request of the pub- 
lishers I undertook to write an Introduction to the 
present work, and in pursuance of this design I 
find that I have come into a somewhat closer per- 
sonal relation with the book." (Italics are mine.) 
A " somewhat closer personal relation " with a 
book accredited to him on the title-page and sold 
by the authority of his fame I He then hastens to 
explain : " In its progress it has passed entirely 
under my revision, and although not absolutely 
responsible for the compilation or its arrange- 
ment, I have, as requested, exercised a free hand 
both in excluding and in adding matter according 
to my judgment of what was best adapted to the 
purposes of the enterprise." This is< first-hand 
testimony that the " Library " was neither com- 
piled nor arranged by the poet, that he merely 
supervised its contents, and that he had to write 
an Introduction in order to acquire a feeling of 
" somewhat closer personal relation " with the 
book! Mr. Hervey quotes a paragraph from the 



480 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 25 



"Publisher's Preface" to the edition of 1878, 
which states that the poet made a "thorough 
revision " of the work before he died. Is not Mr. 
Hervey close enough to the inside of the publish- 
ing business to know how stretchable is such a 
phrase in an unsigned " Publisher's Preface " ? 

Of the second charge Mr. Hervey writes : " This 
history (aside from the lengthy signed historical 
preface) was never claimed to have been written 
by Bryant." This surprises me. It is true that 
everyone " in the trade " knew that, as Mr. Cham- 
plin said, " Bryant scarcely even read the proof- 
sheets." But what of the public who bought the 
book? Let me copy the title-page from the 
London edition of 1876 in the Newberry Library. 
This title-page, which faces a steel-engraving of 
the poet, reads: "A Popular History of the 
United States from the First Discovery of the 
Western Hemisphere by the Northmen to the End 
of the First Century of the Union of the States: 
by William Cullen Bryant and Sydney Howard 
Gay." I leave it to your readers to decide what 
sold this work, here and abroad the real author- 
ship of Mr. Gay, or the pretended authorship of 
Mr. Bryant. Was it, or was it not, as I alleged, 
a case of Bryant's selling his name and venerable 
portrait as the author of a book which he did not 
write? 

As for Bryant's reputation as "the great 
national tone-imparter," let us consult that valua- 
ble bibliography, "American Authors, 1795-1895," 
compiled by P. K. Foley and printed in Boston in 
1897. There we find that, while no other cases 
were so flagrant as the " Popular History of the 
United States," the poet spread his name pretty 
thin, as editor, or author of Prefaces, Introduc- 
tions, etc., over many title-pages; sometimes out 
of mere good will, perhaps, but more often, proba- 
bly, for a financial consideration. He appears, 
for example, as one of the editors of the " Strat- 
ford Edition " of Shakespeare ; but was it he, or 
Mr. Duycinck, who actually did the work? I give 
the titles of some of these publications:

esque sous la direction de W. Cullen Bryant. A

I regret that I am not yet able to change my 
opinion that Bryant, highly gifted and full of fine 
ideals in his youth, yielded gradually to worldly 
influences toward ease, comfort, and respectability, 
to such a degree that his poetic inspiration, and 
even his moral sense, became dulled. As proof of 
the dulling of his poetic inspiration I offer the 
facts that Bryant's best poem, the " Thanatopsis," 
was written before he was twenty, and his next 
best, " Lines to a Waterfowl," only a few years 
later ; and that his later poems show a diminishing 
sensitiveness to the true and permanent spiritual 
values, along with increasing sentimentality and 
conventional piety. 

Mr. Hervey, Mr. William Ellery Leonard, and 
all other admirers of Bryant, may of course give 
him, as a poet, whatever rank they think he 
deserves. But in the interest of a saner, juster, 
and more temperate criticism I submit that to 
place this poet among the " mighty dead " is pre- 
posterous. HARRIET MONROE.

THE LIBRARIAN AS LITERARY CRITIC. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The function of the modern librarian is a multi- 
form one. He must be an administrator, under- 
standing how to control subordinates and plan out 
their work. He must be a practical man, who 
knows how to build and repair the structures he 
administers. He must be a man among men, hav- 
ing that priceless knowledge of how to make 
friends among the people of the community where 
his work is carried on. He must possess those gifts 
which would have made him a good salesman, able 
to meet the wishes of the public and to induce 
them to use such of his wares as he wishes to put 
in their hands. But he must also be much more 
than all this. The librarian must be a scholar, 
knowing books, with ability to judge them, evalu- 
ate them, and appraise them at their true value. 
In other words, he must be a literary critic. Many 
of those who carry on library work are, in greater 
or less degree, possessed of such a character, which 
is after all the highest attribute of the true libra- 
rian. He is the mediator between the author who 
has a message for men, and those to whom the 
message is designed. To librarians, these ideas are 
not new; but to the general public they are not 
so familiar. The average person is too likely to 
forget this vitally important feature of the modern 
librarian's work. 

Mr. Charles Miner Thompson, writing in " The 
Atlantic Monthly" for July, 1908, remarked: 
" There are five groups interested in literary criti- 
cism: publishers of books, authors, publishers of 
reviews, critics, and finally the reading public." 
" No one can quarrel with this grouping," said 
Professor Bliss Perry in " The Yale Review " for 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



481 



July, 1914, " although the more superstitious 
among us may be inclined to assert that there is a 
sixth person present, namely, Literature herself." 

Both of these writers ignore the librarian, and 
for that reason I do not hesitate to quarrel with 
their grouping as incomplete. When the literary 
criticism of librarians is given to hundreds of 
thousands of people who come to libraries for 
books, when the old and young of all grades of 
education and all classes of society come to libra- 
rians for suggestion and advice as to what books 
they should read, when the librarian is continually 
guiding those who borrow books from library 
shelves, is not he one of the most important of 
literary critics? One may readily admit that some 
librarians are not as good literary critics as others, 
because of lack of education or taste or early 
culture; yet the fact remains that one of the most 
potent influences tending to form literary taste 
in America is that proceeding from the contact of 
the librarian with the book borrower. The bor- 
rower realizes this, and often bears testimony to 
the guidance he receives, if it be only that mute 
guidance which comes through the inclusion or 
the exclusion of a book on the shelves, or on a 
reading list. The librarian realizes it, when an 
advanced student thanks him for the appraisal of 
some unknown work, or when a child asks for 
" another pretty book like the last one I had." If 
the library is to do its best work, however, the 
general public must recognize the fact that, by the 
very nature of things, the librarian is forced to 
become a literary critic; for only through such 
recognition can the people secure the greatest 
advantage they may expect from the library. 

We have said that the librarian, from the nature 
of things, must be a literary critic. He must be 
more than this, however, for men and women 
come to the library for many books which are not 
literature. The librarian must be able to guide the 
intending reader to satisfactory books on plumb- 
ing, the indoor cultivation of flowers, the care of 
infants, the keeping of bees. In other words, he 
must take all knowledge for his province, and must 
be a fingerpost to all roads to learning. None of 
these roads are royal; but the librarian who is a 
good roadbuilder may be of great assistance to the 
wayfaring person who may wish to walk in them. 

It follows, from the vastness of the world of 
books, that the librarian must take much of his 
criticism at second hand. He must know where 
to look for the information that he lacks. This 
may be gained from an acquaintance who is versed 
in the subject on which advice is needed, or from 
some periodical of established reputation which 
reviews books in that department of knowledge, or 
from some general guide like the "A. L. A. Book 
List," or from some such specialized evaluation of 
books as Larned's "Literature of American His- 
tory." Even in the narrower field of the literature 
of power and of inspiration, one must know how 
to use the histories of literature. Then, too, the 
librarian must be an adept in the art of skimming 
over a work, of glancing through a series, of 
browsing over a shelf of books; he soon learns 
what a deal of information even the lettering on 



the back of a volume or the words on a title-page 
can convey. Most of all, he must have an insatia- 
ble thirst for reading and a love for the best in 
literature. He must have high ideals and stand- 
ards of life, along with an infectious enthusiasm, 
for literature; and he must endeavor to kindle in 
his readers similar ideals and standards and a like 
love for the written expression of man's highest 
thoughts, hopes, yearnings, and disappointments. 

With the multitudinous details of administration, 
and the constant call of the day's routine, the 
temptation comes to every librarian to relax in his 
duty as a literary critic. This temptation is some- 
times yielded to, for librarians are but men and 
women. But, in any case, the librarian must per- 
force be a critic, whether good or bad, and must 
do his share toward molding the literary taste of 
the community in which he lives. To perform 
this duty aright, he must possess a love for his 
fellow-men and a desire to help them, a broad 
culture based upon a thorough and accurate educa- 
tional training, an ardent zeal to impart to others 
that appreciation of good literature which he has 
gained for himself, and the knowledge of the 
books in which that good literature may be found.

THE LAW OF NECESSITY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of October 28, the reviewer of 
"The War Book of the German General Staff" 
attempts to defend himself against my charge of 
having misrepresented Germany by assuring your 
readers that " the text of the War Book was repro- 
duced literally" in his review. But I did not, 
directly or indirectly, charge him with misquoting 
the War Book. My charge was that he misrepre- 
sented Germany by asserting that to the Germans 
military necessity takes precedence over interna- 
tional law. I quoted from the American Naval 
War Code to show that with us, too, military 
necessity precedes international law. Your re- 
viewer says, absolutely without warrant, that " the 
regularly sanctioned usages of naval warfare 
differ from those of land warfare in certain impor- 
tant respects." I refer your reviewer and your 
readers to any book on International Law for 
proof that the law pertaining to non-combatants, 
the only point now at issue, is the same on land 
and on sea. This is an inevitable and necessary 
corollary of the law of self-preservation, the first 
principle of military law. (Cf. the text-book on 
International Law by G. Davis, professor of his- 
tory and law at West Point.) Your reviewer 
insists that the German principle of warfare re- 
duces itself to " might makes right." Let anyone 
read Mr. Davis's book and he will be convinced 
that all international law is based on this principle. 
Every nation can decide for itself what it chooses 
to consider right if it has the might to enforce it. 

As to your reviewer's statements about my 
tu quoque argument: I meant no more nor less, 
and so your readers undoubtedly understood me,

g A TANNENBAUM . 



New York City, Nov. 12, 1915. 



(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The reviewer of the German War Book quotes 
Dr. Tannenbaum in your issue of October 28: 
" Since when is the doctrine that necessity knows 
no law a German doctrine? " And he attempts an 
answer which he says is obvious. If the answer 
is not thoroughly British in its view-point, it is 
obviously anti-German, at least to one who is 
thoroughly American, to the extent of eight gen- 
erations. This answer is that the doctrine dates 
from "August 4, 1914, when the German Chancel- 
lor proclaimed it unqualifiedly in the Reichstag." 
That proclamation referred to the invasion of 
Belgium. 

We cannot agree with the reviewer. We regret 
the invasion of Belgium. But we have not for- 
gotten the pleas made in the United States Senate 
in 1847, that necessity knows no law. The doc- 
trine was applied to the continuance of an unneces- 
sary war against a country more unfortunate, and 
therefore less influential, than Belgium. But the 
necessity was not one of self-preservation. It was 
not a case of fear for the invasion of one's own 
fatherland. The " necessity " was an imagined 
need for " space." We fought the Mexicans for a 
year after they were ready for peace, because we 
needed their vast territory that would give us the 
Pacific Ocean as a protection from invasion on 
the West. In the course of his noble speech oppos- 
ing this policy, Daniel Webster spoke as follows: 
" Since I have lately heard so much about the dis- 
memberment of Mexico, I have looked back to see how, 
in the course of events which some call Providence, it 
has fared with other nations who have engaged in this 
work of dismemberment. I see that in the latter half 
of the eighteenth century, three powerful nations, 
Eussia, Austria, and Prussia, united in the dismem- 
berment of Poland. They said, too, as you say, ' It is 
our destiny.' They ' wanted room.' Doubtless each of 
these thought that with his share of Poland his power 
was too strong ever to fear invasion or even insult. 
One had his California, another his New Mexico, and 
the third his Vera Cruz. Did they remain untouched 
and incapable of harm? Alas, no! Far, very far 
from it! Eetributive justice must fulfill its 'destiny' 
too. A very few years pass and we hear of a new 
man, a Corsiean lieutenant, a self -named ' armed sol- 
dier of Democracy ' Napoleon. He ravages Austria, 
covers her land with blood, drives the Northern Caesar 
from his capital and sleeps in his palace. Austria 
may now remember how her power trampled upon 
Poland. Did she not pay dear, very dear, for her 
California? " 

He who runs can read the retributive justice 
that has followed France and Russia since Napo- 
leon's day. But how about Prussia? How about 
Mexico? One wonders what Mexico would be 
to-day with her California. 

Three years after Webster's speech, California 
asked for admission as a state, and the conflict 
was precipitated that resulted in a war compared 
with which the Mexican War was a child's adven- 



ture. And it was the slavery issues raised by the 
asking of this state for admission that resulted in 
the introduction of the Clay resolutions and the 
" Seventh of March Speech." That speech was a 
plea for temperate tongues and pens and loyalty 
to the constitution. It failed of its object because 
those in power considered that necessity knows no 
law. We defied the Fugitive Slave Law, and 
Daniel Webster died of a broken heart two years 
later, as pure a patriot as George Washington 
or Abraham Lincoln, and the greatest statesman 
this country has produced. But he stood unsuc- 
cessfully for the idea that the Law must teach us 
patience and wisdom when it comes in conflict 
with what we conceive to be our necessities.

ME. BENSON AND AUTHOES' AGENCIES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A " Casual Comment " paragraph in your issue 
of October 14 deals with Mr. A. C. Benson's good- 
natured acceptance of the labor imposed upon him 
by writers seeking criticism of and advice regard- 
ing their work. Mr. Benson says that " nothing is 
easier than to slip a manuscript into an envelope 
and to require an opinion from an author. I will 
confess that I very seldom refuse these requests." 
It would be interesting to know about Mr. Ben- 
son's attitude toward the numerous commercial 
critics and authors' agencies whose cards appear 
so prominently in the advertising pages of our 
literary periodicals. Why should he not slip his 
burden onto their willing shoulders? Are they too 
strict in their criticisms to be acceptable to the 
writers, or is it feared that their criticism will have 
reference not to the merits of the work criticized 
but to the prospect of further employment? 
Doubtless the fact that an authors' agency must 
naturally charge a fee for its services, whereas 
Mr. Benson could not or at least would not ask 
payment, has a great deal to do with the case.

PEONUNCIATION AND POETEY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Pronunciation has a profound effect upon 
poetry. Take, for example, those famous lines of 
Whittier's : 

" Of all sad words of tongue or pen, 

The saddest are these : ' It might have been ! ' ' 
If this sentiment were expressed by an English 
poet, he would be forced to write : 
" Of all sad English words, I wean, 

The saddest are these: ' It might have been! ' ' 
And a poet of the Middle West would probably 
have done it like this : 
" Sad words are sorrow, sickness, sin ; 

But sadder are these: ' It might have been! ' ' 
Had Whittier bin a Middle Westerner, or had 
he bean English, I should never have ben writing 
these lines. ROBERT J. SHORES.

CARLYLE REDIVIVITS.* 



" Paul of Tarsus whom admiring men have 
since named Saint," in writing to the Church 
at Corinth on the gift of tongues, declares: 
" There are, it may be, many kinds of voices 
in the world, and not one of them is without 
significance. Therefore if I know not the 
meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that 
speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh 
shall be a barbarian unto me." Countrymen 
of the author of " Sartor Resartus " who owe 
their spiritual awakening, or "Baphometic 
fire baptism," to the spirit which animates that 
notable book, are apt to classify the human 
race under the two categories of those who 
have and those who have not a natural affinity 
for the Carlylean philosophy, the Carlylean 
temper, and the Carlylean language. It is not 
easy for those who have rounded the corner of 
middle age, and who are conscious that the 
whole direction of their life-currents and their 
attitudes toward the mysteries and eternities 
have been determined by an early encounter 
with the printed utterances of that incan- 
descent soul, to convey to the youth of this 
generation any adequate impression of all that 
Carlyle has meant for them. By what con- 
ceivable collocation of words is it possible to 
describe the enfranchisement of the spirit, the 
liberation of the imagination, the widened 
horizon, and the breaking of the shackles that 
bind the natural man to the commonplace and 
conventional and make of him a mere atom in 
the cosmic " dance of plastic circumstance " ? 
It cannot be done. Ruskin declared that he 
lamented not so much what men suffer as 
what they lose, and the disciple of Carlyle 
may well deplore that many of his fellow- 
men are deprived of one of the deepest joys of 
the intellect through lack of affinity to the 
mind of that great John the Baptist of modern 
times. 

In the last paragraph of his book entitled 
" Carlyle : How to Know Him," Professor 
Bliss Perry writes what might perhaps more 
appropriately have appeared in the preface: 

" How many Americans, in this first quarter of 
the twentieth century, may be fairly said to know 
Carlyle's work? We read by scraps and patches. 
We recall phrases, we retain impressionistic 
glimpses of characteristic attitudes and gestures, 
we hazard our facile American guess at the per- 
sonality of a Thomas Carlyle, as we do at a hun- 
dred others of yesterday's distinguished names. 
The intent [of this book] is to invite a new gen-

eration of hurried and pre-occupied Americans to 
look back steadily and wisely upon a great figure, 
and to study that figure in the light of Carlyle's 
own varied stimulating and magnificent utter- 
ances." 

That the present book will accomplish this 
high purpose we sincerely hope and confi- 
dently believe. 

Twenty years ago we should have said that 
another volume on the great Scottish seer was 
unnecessary, that it would indeed have been a 
superfluity, and that the last word that need 
be said had already been spoken. But to-day 
conditions have altered. A mighty change has 
come over the world and human life. A revo- 
lution has broken out in Europe, similar in 
character to, but immensely greater in volume 
and significance and tragedy than, that which 
took hold of the imagination of Carlyle in his 
youth and whirled it upwards in a tempestu- 
ous flame of prophetic interpretation. In a 
sense we may say that the French Revolution 
made Carlyle the kind of man be became, and 
gave to his mind the peculiarly individual 
quality by which we have known him. The 
volcanic eruption that shook human society 
to its foundations called for an artist-inter- 
preter, and Thomas Carlyle appeared. 

Has Destiny a similar interpreter of the 
course of human affairs under her wing for 
us at present ? Shall the time call in vain for 
a seer who will tell us the meaning of present- 
day happenings, and restore to us our faith 
in the eternal goodness and wisdom ? Are our 
great publishing houses expectantly looking 
for the advent of such a prophet ; or are they, 
while we write, rejecting the manuscripts of 
God-sent teachers, as the Frasers and Long- 
mans and Hurrays rejected the priceless 
" Sartor Resartus " eighty years ago ? These 
are questions it may be well that all should ask 
themselves whose function in society it is to 
stand at the outposts of thought and watch 
for the coming of the interpreters. Doubtless 
spurious imitations will abound, as they al- 
ways do; but this only makes it the more 
imperative that we keep the feeling for real 
greatness alive, that we may know what a seer 
and prophet is like, and be able to "sense" 
him on his approach. For this reason it is well 
that we should be recalled to a grateful re- 
membrance of the best gift of the gods to the 
English-speaking people of the nineteenth 
century. "We therefore welcome Professor 
Perry's book, and commend it to the attention 
not only of those fortunate ones to whom the 
words of Carlyle are already luminous, but 
even to those others who may yet for the first 
time come under his strange and magnetic 
influence.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 25 



To rightly assess Carlyle's value to the 
world, to accurately estimate his true propor- 
tions, to determine the directions in which his 
vision was sure and unerring and those in 
which his limitations may be discovered, 
here is a task requiring not only knowledge, 
intellectual power and feeling, but unbounded 
admiration and sympathy. For, notwithstand- 
ing the popular maxim, Love is not blind. 
Love is indeed the only human faculty that 
does see clearly, that can discern faults as well 
as virtues and limitations equally with tran- 
scendent powers. In the case of a glowing 
soul of many facets like that of Carlyle, only 
the devout lover can be trusted as his judge, 
to determine the particular niche in the Tem- 
ple of Fame he must ultimately occupy. The 
mere lapse of time, too, makes this more pos- 
sible. The dust of controversy has been finally 
laid ; personal animosities and the " scrannel- 
piping of the night-birds and screech-owls of 
journalism " have died down ; the happenings 
of his time have fallen into their proper 
perspective ; and the titanic figure is revealed 
to those who will lift their eyes, towering 
above the men of his age and generation. 

It can hardly be said that Professor Perry 
has provided answers to the questions which 
he sets forth as follows: 

" It may well be granted that Carlyle's eye and 
hand are marvellous, but how about his mind? 
What shall be said about his political views, his 
theory of the hero, his diagnosis of the Condition 
of England, and the social remedies he proposes? 
Has he trust in progress, in the education of the 
race? Does he believe that a democracy develops 
leadership or promotes fellowship? With the 
word ' faith ' so often on his lips, has he himself a 
living faith in Man and in God, and in the coop- 
eration of man with God ? " 
These are among the insistent questions which 
many a youthful Carlyle-worshipper of thirty- 
five years ago is now compelled to ask himself 
after a working life-time of experience has en- 
riched the content of his mind and changed his 
angle of vision. For it is indeed a strange fact 
that the impassioned utterances of a poet-phi- 
losopher frequently make a more direct appeal 
to the youthful mind before the experiences 
have arrived of which these utterances are the 
interpretation. And when these experiences do 
come, with something of the power of original 
reaction, it requires a strenuous mental effort 
to recall the teachings that had then seemed to 
be as a voice from Sinai, and to re-assess their 
value in the light of the wider horizon and 
enlarged vision that the years have brought. 
Such a one, if a true hero-worshipper, will 
inevitably be haunted by self-accusations of 
the sin of presumption. Even if endowed with 
a large measure of spiritual independence, he 



may have an uneasy recollection of the fable 
which tells of an ass braying at a dead lion, 
and the smallest degree of modesty may deter 
him from putting to himself just those ques- 
tions which Professor Perry asks. Justice to 
our great men, however, demands that we who 
stand upon their shoulders, and thereby enjoy 
an outlook which but for them would have 
been impossible, should in all humility correct 
their reports in so far as our enlarged horizon 
requires. To revert to the similitude contained 
in the fable mentioned, we may admit our kin- 
ship with the humbler creation, yet claim to 
have a vision of a sharper focus though of a 
less wide range and a narrower angle than that 
of our natural superiors. To abandon meta- 
phor, the plain man must recognize that just 
because he is a plain man the duty lies upon 
him of interpreting life for himself, of see- 
ing the world not solely through the eyes of 
the prophet, but by his own vision, aided and 
clarified by what the prophet has told him. 
His critical understanding will thus revive, 
and he will realize, as he did not when under 
the influence of unreasoning devotion, the true 
uses of great men in the world. 

With these precautionary considerations, 
we may examine the questions that Professor 
Perry presents for his reader's consideration. 
It will readily be granted that Carlyle's eye 
and hand were marvellous. His eye was that 
of a seer rather than of an onlooker at human 
life. His vision was like that of the artist to 
whom the curtain has been lifted which (like 
the blinkers on the restive horse) shuts out 
to ordinary mortals all that distracts atten- 
tion from the immediate and practical, and 
the lifting of which reveals the inner mean- 
ings and hidden realities of things. And 
here we touch upon one of the paradoxes 
which we must accept as inseparable from 
the history of those who are naturally eman- 
cipated from the " foolish consistency ' which 
is " the hob-goblin of little minds." That man 
was created to work rather than to speculate 
or feel or dream was, as Professor Perry indi- 
cates, the central maxim of Carlyle's philoso- 
phy; yet his whole life's energies were 'spent 
in feeling and dreaming and speculation, the 
results of which are preserved for us in 
twenty-five octavo volumes. And if we love 
him all the more for this fact, it is because we 
demur to his maxim and believe that in his 
inmost heart Carlyle knew that man was 
made to speculate, and that his work (in the 
ordinary acceptation of the word) ought only 
to serve as a means for helping him to those 
higher elevations from which to scan the hori- 
zon of life and provide food for his dreams 
and speculations. What, indeed, are all his 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



485 



hero-worships, clothes philosophies, and bis- 
torical phantasmagorias but adventures in the 
field of speculation, and attempts to draw 
aside the veil which limits our vision to those 
things that pertain to our "work"? In all 
our attempts to define the intellectual limita- 
tions of Carlyle, or to estimate the value of 
his guidance in the politics of the world, we 
must accord him the highest place as an ad- 
venturous speculator, as a seer and prophet. 
His instinct for the lightness and wrongness 
of things as they are was accurate and un- 
erring. He gave the world an impetus in the 
direction of righteousness such as no other 
modern teacher has done. His name repre- 
sents the greatest moral force that has moved 
Europe during the nineteenth century. His 
craftsmanship, too, was indeed marvellous. 
Never has an instrument been so perfectly 
adapted to its work as was the natural lan- 
guage of Carlyle to the delivery of his mes- 
sage. It is almost impossible in thought to 
dissociate the two; and a translation of 
"Sartor Kesartus" into "classic" English 
would be nearly as unendurable as the ren- 
dering into French of the poems of Burns 
which we were recently privileged to peruse. 
Carlyle's command of his own language was 
that of the supreme artist over his chosen 
medium of expression. 

But granting the seeing eye and the skilful 
hand, what about his mind, as Professor 
Perry asks? Were his intellectual percep- 
tions, his judgments on the correlations of 
causes and effects, his diagnosis of "the con- 
dition of England question," trustworthy and 
of value for the guidance of poor stumbling 
humanity ? Regretfully we reply in the nega- 
tive; and though Professor Perry makes no 
very definite pronouncement of opinion, we 
gather from his quotation of Mazzini in the 
case for democracy that he too feels the time 
has come when we must out of our very love 
for Carlyle recognize wherein his guidance 
has been untrustworthy. His attitude toward 
democracy becomes more and more intolera- 
ble in these latter days, when we are realizing 
that the only hope for the permanent peace 
of the world lies in the direction of a still 
more complete democracy than any we have 
yet known. Since Carlyle was laid to rest, 
Autocracy has been tried on a scale such as 
Nero of Rome or Frederick of Prussia only 
feebly foreshadowed; and, as a consequence, 
Europe is now aflame. Autocracy has been 
weighed in the balance and found wanting; 
and the prophet who told us in words of 
thunder that our highest good lay in finding 
our strong man and putting our affairs 
blindly in his hands, will never again be fully 



trusted as a guide in the conduct of life. In 
regard, again, to the relation of the classes, 
the governing to the working, and the capi- 
talist to the laboring classes, could any utter- 
ance be more offensive both to the reason and 
to the sentiment of a sane and high-souled 
modern democrat than the words : "Despotism 
is essential to most enterprises; and freedom 
too, this is indispensable, we must have it and 
will have it. To reconcile despotism with 
freedom; well, is that such a mystery? Do 
you not already know the way ? It is to make 
your despotism just." 

It would be an ungrateful task to multiply 
quotations from the many that might be given 
of an intellectual attitude toward the prob- 
lem of social life which is becoming more 
repugnant to good men every day. Nothing, 
indeed, but a lofty admiration combined with 
a sense of humor can protect a democratic 
reader from a tendency to throw his "Past 
and Present " out of window on coming upon 
passages like the one quoted. We must con- 
tent ourselves with inquiring into the cause 
of this curious survival of medievalism in the 
mind of a modern prophet. Professor Perry 
remarks that " Carlyle's difficulty lay in his 
distrust of humanity," and this brings us 
pretty near to the cause of all his intellectual 
tortuosities. If the first duty of a free and 
independent soul is to escape from his ances- 
tors, then Carlyle, in spite of his enormous 
endowment of original force, failed to do this, 
for the theology of eighteenth century Scot- 
land held him firmly in its grasp till the close 
of his life. "A Calvinist with the bottom fallen 
out of his creed " is probably the most accu- 
rate description that has yet been given of 
his emotional attitude toward human life and 
destiny. His faith in God and in human 
depravity were equally profound. "Mostly 
fools " was no mere carelessly dropped expres- 
sion in referring to his three million fellow- 
Londoners, but represented his real estimate 
of average humanity. From such a view- 
point what could have been expected in the 
way of sociological theory other than the hope 
for a beneficent despotism to drive the "fools" 
along the paths of pleasantness and peace by 
the masterful hand? 

Another explanation which a sincere dis- 
ciple may offer of Carlyle's reactionism in 
social philosophy is his deeply rooted distrust 
of the intellectual processes, his profound 
contempt for logic-choppers and theory- 
grinders and for mere thinkers in general. 
Shortly after the death of Herbert Spencer a 
story bearing the marks of probability went 
the round of literary circles in London, and 
may not yet have become familiar in America.

THE DIAL 



I Nov. 25 



After the only known occasion on which Car- 
lyle and Spencer intersected one another's 
orbits, Spencer wrote in his diary in his usual 
methodical manner: "Have just been intro- 
duced to Carlyle, a poor creature lacking in 
co-ordination of ideas both intellectual and 
moral." Carlyle, in a letter to a friend, wrote 
of the same interview : " I have just met 
Spencer, an immeasurable ass." Apart 
from the grim humor of the story, it reveals 
the limitations of genius in a pathetic man- 
ner. That the great apostle of the understand- 
ing and the mightiest preacher of modern 
times should have utterly failed to obtain 
even a glimpse of one another's souls, while 
multitudes of plain men and women have 
been able to catch the light that flowed from 
the one and the heat that radiated from the 
other, is a circumstance full of consolation 
for mediocrity, and one that should go far to 
justify the plain man in trusting his critical 
judgments. 

It is, however, because we believe that 
after all the deductions which the discovery 
of his limitations demand, and when every 
possible allowance is made for his inherited 
prejudices and perversities, there will stand 
forth in the stronger relief the greatest spirit 
that has descended among men during a hun- 
dred years, and the force without which our 
intellectual life would be immensely poorer, 
it is because we believe this that we welcome 
and commend Professor Perry's book.

THE 



PAINTING.* 



A good alternative title for Mr. "Willard 
Huntington Wright's book on "Modern 
Painting " would be " The Purification of 
Painting." 

This is the manner of its thought. " Paint- 
ing has been a bastard art an agglomera- 
tion of literature, religion, photography and 
decoration." A " dead cargo of literature, 
archaeology and illustration" has kept it 
from functioning freely. " Those qualities in 
painting by which it is ordinarily judged are 
for the most part irrelevancies from the 
standpoint of pure aesthetics." " It is the 
misfortune of painting that literary impuri- 
ties should have accompanied its development, 
and it is the irony of serious endeavor that on 
account of these impurities there has been an 
indefinite deferment of any genuine appre- 
ciation of painting." 

But " painting should be as pure an art as 

* MODERN PAINTING. Its Tendency and Meaning. By Wil- 
lard Huntington Wright. Illustrated in color, etc. New York : 
John Lane Co: 



music" an art expressing itself "with the 
means alone inherent in that art, as music 
expresses itself by means of circumscribed 
sound." And the means alone inherent in 
painting is color. " Since Cezanne, painting 
means, not the art of tinting drawing or of 
correctly imitating natural objects, but the 
art which expresses itself only with the me- 
dium inherent in it colour." 

This idea that color alone is the concern 
of painting is the thread that runs through 
Mr. Wright's entire treatment. The reader 
of psychological bent will feel like proposing 
as a third title, "The Adventures of an 
Idea." After a hundred years of misunder- 
standing and persecution, the Idea has hero- 
ically arrived. Its final helpers up the rocky 
steep have been the Cubists and the Synchro- 
mists. Its ultimate triumph in Synchromism 
represents the "final purification," or, in the 
somewhat less elegant alternative term of Mr. 
Wright's, the " defecation," of painting. 

There have been three epochs in painting. 
The first began with oil painting about 1400, 
and terminated with Rubens in the "attain- 
ment to the highest degree of compositional 
plasticity which was possible with the fixed 
means of his period." The second a cycle 
of "research and analysis, of scientific ex- 
perimentation and data gathering" was 
ushered in by Turner, Constable, and Dela- 
croix. Courbet and Manet, in this epoch, 
" liberated the painter from set themes " ; the 
Impressionists followed; the Neo-Impression- 
ists "went further afield with scientific ob- 
servations; and finally Renoir, assimilating 
all the new discoveries, rejected the fallacies 
and co-ordinated the valuable conclusions." 

The third epoch resulted in the final purifi- 
cation of painting. Cezanne was its primi- 
tive. " Colour with him became for the first 
time a functional element capable of produc- 
ing form." Absolute freedom of subject- 
selection was followed by absolute freedom 
also in the treatment of subject. Unconven- 
tionality of form went hand in hand with 
unconventionality of theme. Cezanne and 
Matisse, making distortion an aesthetic princi- 
ple, led to Picasso and Cubism. Throughout 
this epoch, abstraction was the aim the 
exclusion of recognizable objects, "the final 
elimination of natural objectivity," the rele- 
gation of the illustrative. " So long as recog- 
nisable objects are presented," art purely as 
abstract form cannot be appreciated. " The 
Cubists, by breaking up a model into parts 
which separately bore little resemblance to 
nature, proved that they not only recognised 
the demands of pure organisation but that 
they knew those demands could never be met 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



487 



so long as there were recognisable objects in a 
painting." Synchromism " took the final step 
in the elimination of the illustrative object." 

" Thus was brought about the final purifica- 
tion of painting. Form was entirely divorced 
from any realistic consideration: and colour 
became an organic function. The methods of 
painting, being rationalized, reached their 
highest degree of purity and creative capabil- 
ity." " The evolution of painting from tinted 
illustration to an abstract art expressed 
wholly by the one element inherent in it 
colour; was a natural and inevitable progress. 
Music passed through the same development 
from the imitation of natural sounds to har- 
monic abstraction." "Form and colour 
the two permanent and inalienable qualities 
of painting have become synonymous. An- 
cient painting sounded the depths of com- 
position. Modern painting has sounded the 
depths of colour. Research is at an end. It 
now remains only for artists to create. . . No 
more innovatory ' movements ' are possible. 
. . The era of pure creation begins with the 
present day." 

Upon reading the penultimate sentence at 
least, public and artists alike, of whatever 
aesthetic creed, will heave the traditional sigh 
of relief. No more innovatory movements 
are possible. " The means have been per- 
fected: the laws of organisation have been 
laid down." Painting has at length settled 
to her task. The production of ineffably puri- 
fied and unrecognizable masterpieces may 
now be expected as a matter of course. 

The clearness and sureness with which Mr. 
"Wright records the triumph of the Idea are 
such as to prompt the lively hope that the 
experience of painting is symptomatic. It is 
a daring thought, but it may be that in mor- 
als, in religion, in pedagogy, in civics, in 
social relations, in poetry, and in other fields 
where Ideas have been adventuring, as well as 
in painting, we are nearer than we suspect to 
ultimate defecation and absolute unrecogniza- 
bility. In these fields, too, we may live to see 
the day when we can stop talking about things 
and begin to do them. 

Yet" it is with feelings of dismay that the 
lover of art contemplates the history of paint- 
ing as told in these pages. The path to per- 
fection has been strewn with awful wreckage. 
One movement after another is proved by a 
quickly arriving successor to have been abor- 
tive. Impressionists, Pointillists, Divisionists, 
Chromo-luminarists, Neo-Impressionists, Cu- 
bists, Futurists, Intimists, Vorticists, Syn- 
chromists all have come and gone with ever 
increasing swiftness. There has been endless 
theorizing, talking, and experimentation, with 



a good deal of wild putting of things on 
canvas; but only once in a while an achieve- 
ment in itself worth while, even in Mr. 
Wright's mind. Of the Vorticists, whose 
headquarters are in London, he says : " Their 
creed is an intelligent one, and is in direct 
line with the current tendencies. As yet they 
have produced no pictures which might be 
called reflective of their principles, but have 
kept before English artists the necessity of 
eliminating the unessentials." The Cubists 
are already a thing of history. Even the 
Futurists are in the past tense. Besides, the 
Futurists never did represent real advance. 
They are "at bottom decadent, inasmuch as 
they turn their art back to illustration." The 
reader who wishes to know the extent of 
Futurist reversion to illustration may satisfy 
his curiosity by turning to Mr. Wright's two 
reproductions, Severini's Hieroglyphe Dynam- 
ique du Bal Tabarin and Russolo's Dyna- 
misme d' une Auto. For specimens of the 
really unillustrative and objectively unrecog- 
nizable as it culminates in the Synchromists, 
he should look at Russell's Synchromie Cos- 
mique and Macdonald- Wright's "Arm Organi- 
sation in Blue-Green." The latter is impure, 
however; we are bidden to look near the 
centre for a " small and arbitrary interpreta- 
tion of the constructional form of the human 
arm." 

Mr. Wright is conscious of the disparity 
between claims and achievement in the New 
Painting. Men and movements have con- 
tributed to theory and technique rather than 
to art, to possibility rather than to possession. 
He explains : " The new methods are so young 
that painters have not had time to acquire 
that mastery of material without which the 
highest achievement is impossible. . . Mod- 
ern art, having no tradition of means, has 
sapped and dispersed the vitality of its expo- 
nents by imposing upon them the necessity 
for empirical research. It is for this reason 
that we have no men in modern art who 
approximate as closely to perfection as did 
many of the older painters." 

And yet the gravity and assurance with 
which Mr. Wright presents and discusses his 
illustrations leave no doubt in the reader's 
mind as to his very favorable estimate of the 
actual achievement of modern painting. 
Praise of the modern and disparagement of 
the old go hand in hand. Courbet's Les Cas- 
seurs de Pierres is "far greater than any- 
thing Millet has ever done, despite the vast 
popularity of such purely sentimental pic- 
tures as the Angelus and The Man with the 
Hoe. . . In Millet's best canvases one finds 
at most only a parallelism of lines, and in his 



488 



THE DIAL 



Nov. 25 



lesser pictures even this amateurish attempt 
at organisation is lacking." 

In the light of so much assurance, it is 
interesting to examine the four subjects in 
color and the twenty-four reproductions with 
which Mr. Wright has adorned his book. If 
they illustrate anything as a whole, it surely 
is that in proportion as the painting of the 
past century has ascended in the scale of 
theory and technique it has descended in the 
scale of beauty, intelligibility, and emotional j 
appeal. Of the twenty-eight illustrations as j 
they appear in this book, fifteen would be 
classed by any person except a modernist stu- 
dent or a devotee of the comic supplement as 
either ugly, grotesque, or mystifying; and 
most of the fifteen fall within the period of 
nearest approach to " final purification." 
Nor is it clear how these qualities could fail 
to be felt before the actual canvas, however 
perfect the color. It is significant, too, that 
Mr. Wright's criticism is almost wholly con- 
cerned with the Idea the theory and the 
science of painting, rather than its apprecia- 
tion. Of enthusiasm for beauty there are 
comparatively few traces. 

Of course the answer to this is all ready. 
The competence of the adverse critic is con- 
sistently denied. " The ignorant and reac- 
tionary may laugh and hurl philippics. For 
centuries painting has been reared on a false 
foundation, and the criteria of aesthetic appre- 
ciation have been irrelevant." " The lack of 
comprehension and consequently the ridi- 
cule which has met the efforts of modern 
painters, is attributable not alone to a misun- 
derstanding of their seemingly extravagant 
and eccentric mannerisms, but to an ignorance 
of the basic postulates of all great art both 
ancient and modern." Preferences for the 
old masters, "if they are symptomatic of 
aught save the mere habit of mind immersed 
in tradition, indicate an immaturity of artis- 
tic judgment which places prettiness above 
beauty, and sentimentality and documentary 
interest above subjectivity and emotion." 
"An untechnical onlooker . . can never sound 
the depths of art. . . Critics for the most part 
are writers whose admiration for art has been 
born in front of the completed works of the 
great masters." 

What this really means is that what the 
modern painters say of themselves is true 
because the modern painters say it is true. It 
is a denial of the right of even the cultivated 
public to participate a denial of the social 
nature of art. 

And of course we are reminded that criti- 
cism has a record by no means free from 
examples of fallibility, and that genius has 



often before been laughed at. The logic of 
this is simple. The critics fought Wagner, 
and the critics were wrong; therefore the 
critics are wrong in opposing the Synchro- 
mists. Genius has sometimes been resisted 
and laughed at; therefore everything that is 
resisted and laughed at is genius. And yet 
Mr. Wright himself says the Futurists are at 
bottom decadent. He does not laugh at them. 
The modernist is incapable of laughter at 
anything except what are foolishly called the 
eternal verities. 

Mr. Wright's book is well written, and dis- 
plays a thorough familiarity with modern 
painting. Considering the content, it is writ- 
ten even with some restraint. It serves well 
the purpose of definition, and is for this rea- 
son very welcome. But for most lovers of art 
it has a fundamental defect. They will deny 
ignorantly and undefecatedly, of course 
the doctrines of unrecognizability and the all- 
sufficiency of color. We often speak of carry- 
ing a thing to its logical conclusion, and it is 
no very great compliment to logic that we 
usually balk at the carrying of things to their 
logical conclusions. Modern painting and its 
apologists have not balked. Ordinary earthly 
logic could ask no greater compliment than 
the one they have paid it. But perhaps the 
musical analogy is not perfect. Perhaps a 
symphony itself is not absolutely uninvolved 
with illustration. It is to be doubted whether 
any art may or ought to be perfectly pure. 
Perhaps painting must be, let us not say a 
bastard art, but a complex art. Perhaps the 
old masters, and the earlier of the new, were 
not wholly illogical or incompetent in still 
conceiving of color as instrument rather 
than end. The old masters were undeniably 
geniuses, if only in a small way. 

For the reader who desires to regard the 

painter's art from a different angle, Kenyoii 

Cox's solid and spirited " The Classic Point of 

View" cannot be too strongly recommended.

MEMORIALS OF A GREAT ASTRONOMER.* 



To those of us who knew Sir Robert Ball, 
the volume of "Reminiscences and Letters," 
now published under the editorship of his son, 
is very satisfactory. A " big " book was neces- 
sary for any complete account of the man and 
his career. Fortunately, Sir Robert had dic- 
tated many of his reminiscences some years 
before his final illness, and the result makes 
a very engaging volume. The hiatus which

sometimes occurs in his recollections is admira- 
bly filled with his own letters, and also with 
those of his friends of whom, indeed, there 
were an army. 

Sir Robert's account of his early years at 
Trinity is a charming record of undergraduate 
life ; and his own efforts to perfect his charac- 
ter, as well as his scientific studies, are shown 
in the records of this period. In one of these 
he says : " I have not sufficiently practised 
(1) kindness, (2) moderation, (3) gentleness, 
(4) sufficient thought before speaking, (5) re- 
pression of sarcastic habits." 

His first position after leaving college was 
that of tutor to Lord Rosse's three youngest 
sons, a very congenial billet. Lord Rosse was 
hospitably inclined toward the young tutor, 
who already felt a drawing to astronomy, and 
permission to use the famous Rosse telescope 
was his chief delight. This instrument was 
actually constructed by Lord Rosse; and al- 
though since removed to the Victoria and Al- 
bert Museum at South Kensington, was at this 
time in fine shape for use, particularly upon 
the nebulas. The young man was both tutor 
and astronomer, and some of his happiest days 
were during these two years. The morning 
was spent with his pupils in the castle; and 
aside from the games and recreation with 
them afterward, he devoted his afternoons and 
spare time to the workshops. Lord Rosse gave 
him carte blanche, also, to borrow any book 
from his library. The use of the large tele- 
scope must have been very laborious, as it took 
four assistants to make observations. On fine 
evenings Ball would go to the observatory as 
soon as it was dark. It was here that he 
witnessed the display of November meteors of 
1866, a magnificent occasion brilliantly de- 
scribed by the author. The guest book at Par- 
sonstown Observatory contains the names of 
many of the great astronomers. Ball speaks 
of visiting Sir William Huggins, to whose 
house Lord Rosse took him during some of 
their London trips, and to those of other scien- 
tific men. 

The seven years after Ball left Lord Rosse 
were full of work and achievement. He took 
a position in the Royal College of Science in 
Dublin, as professor of applied mathematics 
and mechanics. At Trinity he had devoted 
much attention to these subjects, and his hours 
in Lord Rosse's workshop had given him a 
deeper insight into mechanics, to which he 
devoted his first course of lectures. He con- 
tinued at the Royal College until 1874, when 
his friends urged him to apply for the position 
of Royal Astronomer of Ireland. He was ap- 
pointed, finding himself Astronomer Royal of 
Ireland and Andrews Professor of Astronomy 



in the University of Dublin, a double assign- 
ment which he held for eighteen years. Al- 
ways happy in himself, his work, and his 
friends, Sir Robert's sense of humor was 
kindly and never cynical, and this endeared 
him to all. At the Dunsink Observatory some 
of his happiest hours were spent. He speaks 
of the magnificent prospect from this site. 
Indeed, we remember well the extraordinary 
view spread out on every side, the sea and 
the city of Dublin, Phoenix Park in front, and 
the beautiful range of mountains including 
Three Rock and Two Rock, and the Wicklow 
mountains behind. 

Sir Robert speaks in appreciative terms of 
hisi predecessors, among them Sir William 
Rowan Hamilton and Dr. Briinnow. Dr. 
Copeland was assistant astronomer, but he was 
absent when Ball first went to Dunsink, hav- 
ing accompanied the famous expedition of 
Lord Lindsay (subsequently Earl of Craw- 
ford) to observe the transit of Venus at Mau- 
ritius. The second of the pair of transits of 
Venus, in December of 1882, Sir Robert ob- 
served himself. The sky was covered with 
clouds during the day, but in the late after- 
noon it lightened almost miraculously, the 
sun burst forth, and Sir Robert beheld the 
globe of Venus standing out on the solar disc. 
It was extremely gratifying to him, and of 
the utmost importance to the astronomers of 
this and all other countries. Those who beheld 
this spectacle in all its beauty will have no 
other opportunity until June, 2004, although 
Venus in her frequent journeys around the 
sun passes only a little above or a little below 
the disc each time. 

In 1892, Sir Robert was appointed Lown- 
dean Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, 
in succession to John Couch Adams. He was 
also appointed Director of the Cambridge Ob- 
servatory. There is less in his reminiscences 
concerning the life at Cambridge than of some 
other portions, but fortunately his many let- 
ters enable the chapter to Jbe written largely 
from his own point of view. There are numer- 
ous letters of congratulation on his appoint- 
ment, and his own letters are filled with his 
reasons for making the change, particularly 
the letter to Mrs. Adams, the widow of his 
predecessor. 

In July, 1892, he was given a fellowship at 
Kings College, Cambridge. In December of 
the same year the degree of Master of Arts 
was conferred on him at the Senate' House at 
Cambridge. The account of his reception 
there, and the countless friends who made this 
occasion noteworthy, takes up a large part of 
the chapter on Cambridge. Sir Joseph Lar- 
mor has written a fine account of Ball's work 



490 



THE DIAL 



Nov. 25 



during the Cambridge years. Dr. A. A. Com- 
mon, Sir William and Lady Hugging, Sir 
David Gill, and others of his friends give char- 
acteristic pictures of this great man who was 
nevertheless so delightfully human. In 1899 
the Cambridge University Press undertook the 
publication of his treatise on the Theory of 
Screws, the most abstract and purely mathe- 
matical of Sir Robert's writings. His work on 
" Spherical Astronomy " is constantly referred 
to, and his " Story of the Heavens " is widely 
popular. 

Sir Robert's mind appears to have been won- 
derfully versatile. His interest in botany was 
very great, and one of the constant compan- 
ions on his travels was a copy of Bentham's 
"British Flora." On his country walks of 
spring or early summer it was difficult to find 
a plant which he could not name in English or 
Latin. His copy of Bentham was especially 
interleaved, and on the blank pages he re- 
corded the place in which he found any par- 
ticular plant. In wild animals, also, Sir Robert 
was not less interested. He was a member 
of the Council of the Dublin Zoological So- 
ciety, and he always actively engaged in its 
affairs. 

Ball's own account of the real beginning of 
his career as a lecturer is contained largely in 
some notes which he collected when planning 
to write his reminiscences. His first lecture on 
the public platform was in February, 1869, 
when at the Belfast Athenaeum he spoke on. 
" Some Recent Astronomical Discoveries." 
He records triumphantly: "I made 14 s. 
This is the first sum I ever made by this 
method." Later in the same year he gave other 
scientific lectures, exhibiting even in those 
early days that power of exposition which 
afterwards rendered him facile princeps 
among public lecturers. In 1881 he gave one 
of his most famous lectures, "A Glimpse 
through the Corridors of Time." The vast 
reach of tides was appreciated by mathemati- 
cians; but few in a large popular audience 
could have known the part played by tidal 
evolution in molding earth, moon, and planets 
millions of years ago. It was a singularly 
beautiful and instructive address. "A Night 
with Lord Rosse's Telescope," "The Moon," 
and " Krakatoa " were some of the later sub- 
jects. His lectures became more and more 
popular. He went on numerous tours, and 
his accounts of his entertainment and the 
journeys in connection with these are espe- 
cially interesting to those of us who have done 
similar work on a smaller scale. 

Ball's lectures at the Royal Institution were 
highly significant. Faraday had explained to 
a delighted audience the results of his investi- 



gations in magneto-electricity; and Profes- 
sor Tyndall's lectures had been subsequently 
published in book form. Faraday himself had 
given a famous Christmas course on " The 
Chemistry of a Candle." With some diffi- 
dence Sir Robert gave his first course of 
Christmas lectures, illustrating them by appa- 
ratus which he had made himself. It is hardly 
necessary to say that these lectures were very 
popular. The audience comprised persons of 
all ages, from a child of eight years to Madame 
Antoinette Sterling and the Lord Chancellor. 
" The Universe in Motion " was another of his 
most popular lectures. Sir Robert's personal 
notes and memoranda about his lectures were 
very exacting ; but when some one inquired if 
he did not weary of speaking night after 
night, his reply was : " When you have some 
skill in your art, the exercise of it is delight- 
ful." He several times made lecture trips 
through the United States, and was every- 
where greeted with great affection and ac- 
corded the closest attention. At home he gave 
courses of lectures to his advanced students at 
Cambridge on Screws, the Planetary Theory, 
and other abstract subjects. 

In 1882 he was appointed Scientific Advisor 
to the Irish Lights Board, in succession to the 
late Professor Tyndall. For several years he 
enjoyed the annual cruise of the Inspecting 
Committee around the island on their yacht, 
the " Princess Alexandra." He went to Nor- 
way for the eclipse in 1896. All expeditions 
of that year, save Nova Zembla, suffered de- 
feat from clouds. The present reviewer was 
in Yezo, and can testify that, as a spectacle, 
the eclipse will never be duplicated. The 
Astronomer Royal was on the south-east coast 
of Yezo, and we afterwards met and compared 
notes. Sir Robert gives a very delightful de- 
scription of the north country. 

In this charming biography, or autobiog- 
raphy as it might almost be called, the interest 
of its subject in human nature, as well as in 
the wonders of the heavens, is all-pervasive. 
The pictures which it gives of Sir Robert 
Ball's human and genial nature are beauti- 
fully sketched, and one reads every word of 
the memoir, from the first to the last. It is a 
delightful book about a delightful man whose 
hands and head were always busy with some 
abstruse yet popular subject. It was in 1913 
that he died, when but seventy-three years 
old, having filled those years to the full with 
strenuous endeavor. The sentence from Car- 
lyle which just before his death Sir Robert 
chose for a motto well expresses the spirit of 
his own life, " Happy is the man who has 
found his work."

THE IRVING-BREVOORT LETTERS.* 

Washington Irving was frank and open in 
his relations with all men, yet it is doubtful if 
he ever revealed himself more fully than in 
the letters to his life-long friend Henry Bre- 
voort. A considerable number of these letters 
were known to Pierre M. Irving, who gave 
copious and on the whole well-chosen extracts 
from them in his " Life and Letters of Wash- 
ington Irving," but it is a pleasure to have 
them in their completeness. They are now 
issued, as edited by Mr. George S. Hellman, in 
an edition limited to 255 sets, beautifully 
printed at the Knickerbocker Press, and taste- 
fully bound. In a prefatory note, the publish- 
ers speak of " the relations of close sympathy 
and of personal friendship that existed 
through a long series of years between Wash- 
ington Irving and the late G. P. Putnam," and 
express their pleasure at being able to bring 
forth this work of Irving's, much of which has 
hitherto remained unpublished. The happy 
tone of this note and the attractive appear- 
ance of the volumes tend to make their appear- 
ance a formal festive occasion, on which 
tributes may be paid to the genial American 
author whose work is now rounding out a cen- 
tury of popularity, and congratulations offered 
to the publishers whose name has been so long 
and so honorably linked with his. 

This being the spirit in which the reader 
takes up Mr. Hellman's edition of the letters, 
it may seem inappropriate to point out defects. 
But there are certain things which one has a 
right to demand of any work, be it textbook, 
standard edition, or volume de luxe; and it 
must long be a cause of regret to students of 
American literature that the editor's work in 
the present instance has not been better done. 
Intimate personal letters like these, full of 
references to friends and relatives designated 
by abbreviated and pet names, would be im- 
mensely more valuable if accompanied by 
explanatory notes. It may be that the task of 
annotation has been left for a later edition; 
but surely such editorial work as has here 
been done should be reasonably accurate and 
intelligent. 

The letters are supposedly given in chrono- 
logical order. The first is printed with the 
date " Oct. 23d, 1807," and of this the editor 
says: 

"And now, following the path of these letters, 
let us accompany Irving down the stream of the 
years. We find him first a genial, light-hearted 
youth of twenty-four, preparing the publication of 
that book which is more intimately associated than 
any other with the name and traditions of our city

the History of New York by Diedrich Knicker- 
bocker." 

The testimony of Irving's biographers is that 
in 1807, when Irving was a youth of twenty- 
four, the "Knickerbocker History" was not 
begun and probably not even thought of. The 
author himself says, in the ''Apology" pre- 
fixed to later editions, that it was " commenced 
in company with my brother, the late Peter 
Irving, Esq." ; and according to the " Life and 
Letters," "Peter had returned from a year's 
absence in Europe just before the appearance 
of the last number [of " Salmagundi," Jan. 25, 
1808], and in conjunction . . the two broth- 
ers commenced the History of New York." 
There is no evidence that Washington Irving 
made any extended visit to Philadelphia in 
the autumn of 1807, and he surely published 
no important work there. But let the letter 
speak for itself: 

" I have been delayed in putting my work to 
press by some minute & curious facts which I 
found in a Mss. in the Phila d Library & which has 
obliged me to make alterations in the first vol. but 
to-morrow I begin by God. 

" I wish you would immediately forward me the 
inscription on old P. Stuyvesant Tombstone and 
get Jim as well as yourself to prepare some squibbs 
&c to attract attention to the work when it comes 
out." 

It would be interesting to know how the 
editor interprets all this in the light of the 
date he assigns. Certainly the paragraphs 
quoted seem to place the letter in the autumn 
of 1809, when Irving is known to have been 
in Philadelphia for the purpose of bringing 
out the History. In the absence of the MS., 
it seems a reasonable conjecture that the 
editor mis-read 1807 for 1809 ; that he failed 
utterly to consider the contents of the letter; 
and that instead of being printed as number 
one, it should be number five. 

If the error is only in the year, the day of 
the month raises some interesting questions. 
The " Life and Letters " states that 
" In the November succeeding, Mr. Irving repaired 
to Philadelphia to superintend the publication of 
his History of New York. . . Though the author 
had carried the manuscript in a complete state to 
Philadelphia, yet he afterward made some addi- 
tions, as was not unusual with him, as the work was 
going through the press. It was here that he wrote 
the voyage of Peter Stuyvesant up the Hudson, 
and the enumeration of the army." 
But if this letter were dated October 23, 1809, 
Irving went to Philadelphia before November, 
and we have another of the many instances 
in which the earlier biographer is not impec- 
cable in matters of detail. Moreover, the 
mock advertisement announcing the disap- 
pearance of Mr. Knickerbocker from the 



492 



THE DIAL 



[ Nov. 25 



Columbian Hotel in Mulberry Street appeared 
in -the "Evening Post" of October 26 (the 
"Life and Letters" seems to give the date 
incorrectly as Oct. 25). Was this a prompt 
response on the part of Brevoort to the 
appeal for "squibbs" to call attention to the 
work? And if so, is the credit for this in- 
genious advertising to be given not to Irving, 
but to his friends who remained in New York ? 
It is, however, unsatisfactory to base specula- 
tions on printed data that are clearly wrong 
in one important point, and that may be 
wrong in others. Such looseness as this on 
the first page of a work casts doubt on the 
accuracy of any part. 

If the reader loses his tone of urbanity 
over the vagaries of the editor, he is helped 
to regain it when he comes to the writings of 
Irving himself. Irving is urbane, with the 
unfailing urbanity that comes from kindli- 
ness of heart. The earlier letters are not 
wholly without a certain affectation that is 
more representative of the time and the place 
than of Irving. The " by God " of the letter 
already quoted, the "Damme" with which 
another ends, and similar expressions, are 
strange oaths which seem somehow to be 
swaggered forth with an embarrassed air. 
Though there can be no doubt of Irving's 
susceptibility, the references to women that 
fill so large a space in the early letters imply 
an attitude as man of the world that is not 
quite natural. 

" The little Taylor has been here and passed some 
time since your departure. She is a delightful 
little creature, but alas, my dear Hal, she has not 
the pewter, as the sage Peter says. As to beauty, 
what is it ' but a flower ! ' Handsome is that hand- 
some has, is the modern maxim. Therefore, lit- 
tle Taylor, ' though thy little finger be armed in a 
thimble,' yet will I set thee at defiance. In a word, 
she is like an ortolan, too rare and costly a dainty 
for a poor man to afford, but were I a nabob, 'fore 
George, ortolans should be my only food. 

"As I rode into town the other day, I had nearly 

ran down the fair Maria M re. I immediately 

thought of your sudden admiration for her, which 
seemed to spring up rather late in the season, like 
strawberries in the fall when every other swain's 
passion had died a natural & lingering death. The 
fair Maria (for almighty truth will out) begins in 
my eyes to look, as that venerable Frenchman Todd 
would say D d stringy. She has been act- 
ing very much the part of the dog in the manger 
she cannot enjoy her own chastity but seems un- 
willing to let anybody else do it. There certainly 
is a selfish pleasure in possessing a thing which is 
exclusively our own and which we see everybody 
around us coveting. And this may be the reason 
why we sometimes behold very beautiful women 
maintaining resolute possession of their charms 
and what makes me think this must be the reason is 
that in proportion as these women grow old, and 



the world ceases to long after their treasures, they 
seem the most ready to part with them, until they 
at length seem ready to sacrifice them to the first 
bidder, and even to importune you to take them off 
their hands. This however I hope and believe will 
never be the case with the fair Maria, who, thanks 
to her cool temperament can still pass on ' in maiden 
meditation fancy free.' " (July 8, 1812.) 

There is much of this sort of thing; but, 
though it would be too strong to call it pose, 
it is not quite the real Irving. 

By far the greater number of the letters 
were written during Irving's long stay abroad 
from 1815 to 1832. A marked, almost an 
abrupt, change seems to come over the man 
as he finds himself at Birmingham and Liver- 
pool, oppressed by the perplexities of busi- 
ness, and anxious concerning the health of his 
brother Peter. He never loses courage, and 
in all his letters there is no trace of bitter- 
ness or cynicism; but he is never again the 
petted and somewhat irresponsible younger 
son, content only to enjoy life gaily. In July, 
1817, when there was no hope of saving the 
family fortunes, he wrote in a letter part of 
which was quoted in the " Life and Letters " : 

" I have weighed every thing pro and con on the 
subject of returning home and have for the present 
abandoned the idea. My affections would at once 
prompt me to return, but in doing so, would they 
insure me any happiness? Would they not on the 
contrary be productive of misery? I should find 
those I love & whom I had left prosperous strug- 
gling with adversity without my being able to 
yield them comfort or assistance. Every scene of 
past enjoyment would be a cause of regret and dis- 
content. I should have no immediate mode of sup- 
port & should be perhaps a bother to my friends 
who have claims enough on their sympathy & exer- 
tions. No no. If I must scuffle with poverty let 
me do it out of sight where I am but little known 
where I cannot even contrast present penury 
with former affluence. In this country I have a 
plan for immediate support it may lead to some- 
thing better at any rate it places me for a time 
above the horrors of destitution or the more galling 
mortifications of dependence." 

To this same subject of returning to America, 
and to the pain caused by friends who mis- 
understood his motives for staying abroad, he 
frequently recurs. To a question by Brevoort 
whether he intends to renounce his country 
he writes, March 10, 1821, a spirited reply the 
best parts of which are given in the "Life 
and Letters," and need not be quoted here. 
The details of personal business affairs of 
embarrassments and drafts and loans 
which fill many pages are not in themselves 
edifying, but they show how beset the author 
long was by financial difficulties, how trou- 
bled he was by them, and how anxious he was 
not to burden 'others or even to blame them

when they were less considerate than they 
might have been. 

These volumes contain no great and strik- 
ing contribution to our knowledge of Irving's 
life, and they are not especially rich in pic- 
turesque detail. It seems as if the author 
wrote more objective description of sights and 
scenes to other friends and relatives, and 
kept for Brevoort his most intimate and per- 
sonal feelings. The letters do, therefore, help 
us to a closer view of the man, and they do 
nothing but add to the regard and respect 
which we already feel for him. Nor should 
this notice close without reference to Henry 
Brevoort. Once a well known citizen of New 
York, a man of wealth and culture and public 
spirit, it is probably his fate henceforth to be 
remembered chiefly as the friend of Irving. 
So is literary fame, if it be really fame, 
greater and more lasting than that won in 
most fields of endeavor. Of his writing no 
word is given here ; but a man may be judged 
by the letters he receives as well as by those 
he writes. The friend to whom Irving could 
so express himself was a kindly and manly 
person, and worthy of at least passing 
remembrance. WILLIAM B. CAIRNS. 



JjITERATTJRE AND HISTORY.* 

Mr. Hilaire Belloc's new volume, resplen- 
dent in red and gold, with its many attractive 
illustrations, its double-leaded pages with 
luxurious margins, its freedom from all scien- 
tific apparatus in the form of maps, foot- 
notes, and bibliographies, and above all its 
dramatic title, "High Lights of the French 
Revolution," displays all the outward signs of 
history conceived in the literary vein, whose 
avowed purpose is to entertain. An examina- 
tion of the contents of the volume only serves 
to strengthen the inference drawn from its 
outward form. As the title suggests, Mr. 
Belloc makes no serious effort to describe the 
revolution as a whole, but sketches in a light 
way a few of its dramatic episodes, and is 
far more concerned with literary effects than 
with historic truth. But it is not simply as a 
piece of literature that Mr. Belloc's volume 
would be judged ; it is history in the form of 
literature, the work, we are told, of " the 
ablest living writer on these themes. . . Pic- 
turesque, vivid, minutely circumstantial, rush- 
ing in interest. In literary qualities the 
episodes are comparable to those of Carlyle, 
and they have the added advantage of a less 
prejudiced point of view, a greater precision 

* HIGH LIGHTS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. By Hilaire 
Belloc. Illustrated in color. New York : The Century Co. 



in matters of fact, and an easier, more gra- 
cious style." If we can believe this announce- 
ment, Mr. Belloc has succeeded in reconciling 
the legitimate demands of both history and 
literature, has produced a book that is at 
the same time a work of science and a work of 
art. 

But has he succeeded? Has he given us a 
sound piece of historical writing? If not, 
whatever else his book may be, it is not his- 
tory. Now truth is the first test of the value 
of every historical work. If it be not true, it 
matters not how " interesting " or " readable " 
a work may be, it is not history. Even 
Croce, who would classify history and litera- 
ture under art, defines literature as "knowl- 
edge of the ideally possible," history as 
" knowledge of what has actually happened." 
Literature appeals primarily to the emotions, 
history to the intellect. The task of the his- 
torian, the truthful restoration of man's 
unique social evolution, is an arduous one, 
and has little in common with the work of 
the poet or of the novelist. To search labo- 
riously for evidence, to criticize the evidence 
when found, to reconstruct the facts of the 
past by a comparison of the affirmations of 
independent eye-witnesses, to combine these 
facts into a complex and changing whole, 
restraining the inclination of the imagination 
to go beyond the evidence and state more than 
the evidence would justify, this is work for 
a scientist, not for an artist. So true is this 
that a man with a decidedly artistic tempera- 
ment, with a strong subconscious imagination 
fitting him for creative literary work, may be 
utterly unfitted for scientific historical work. 
It was said of Froude that he was " constitu- 
tionally inaccurate." Everyone "commits 
some errors . . the abnormal thing is to com- 
mit many, to commit them constantly, in spite 
of the most persevering efforts to be exact. 
. . The involuntary imagination, taking a part 
in the intellectual operations, produces bad 
results. It fills in by conjecture gaps in the 
memory, it magnifies or attenuates the real 
facts, it confounds them with its pure inven- 
tion." Like Froude, Mr. Belloc artistically 
brilliant is " constitutionally inaccurate," 
the victim of a too powerful subconscious 
imagination that unfits him for scientific his- 
torical work. I made this observation some 
years ago in a review of his life of Robes- 
pierre. All of his later work has simply 
strengthened this first impression, most of 
all the present volume on "High Lights of 
the French Revolution." 

This criticism, if well founded, is a serious 
one. It is the duty of the historian to pro- 
tect the public against unsound historical

work. And against no modern writer dealing 
with historical subjects does the public stand 
more in need of protection than against Mr. 
Belloc. He literally invites confidence in his 
seemingly exact scholarship. In the preface 
to his life of Robespierre he wrote : 

" It will be discovered by my reader that con- 
tinually throughout the following pages I have 
introduced that kind of description which is ex- 
pected rather in the evidence of an eye-witness or 
in the creations of fiction. I know that such an 
attempt at vivid presentation carries with it a cer- 
tain suspicion when it is applied to history. I can 
only assure my readers that the details I have 
admitted can be proved to be true from the witness 
of contemporaries or from the inference which 
their descriptions and the public records of the 
time permit one to draw." 

In the face of that statement, who of the 
many readers of Mr. Belloc's delightful vol- 
ume even suspected that it swarmed with 
errors from cover to cover? And to how 
many of the readers of the present volume 
will he fail to communicate confidence in his 
scholarship when he writes : 

"Necker would have it in his memoirs that he 
was overborne by Barentin and, as one may say, 
by the queen's party; that his original compro- 
mise was made a little stronger in favor of the 
crown. To this charge, like the weak and false 
man he was, he would ascribe all the breakdown 
that followed. I do not beliete him. I think he 
lied. We know how he made his fortune and we 
know how to contrast the whole being of a man 
like Necker with the whole being of a man like 
Barentin. Read Barentin's notes on those same 
two days and you will have little doubt that Necker 
lied." 

The inference Mr. Belloc would have us draw 
from this passage is that he has carefully 
investigated the matter of his book, and that 
we may put the utmost confidence in the cor- 
rectness of his statements. To prove that this 
inference is unjustified is not difficult. The 
examples are numerous; it is simply a ques- 
tion of choice. I shall limit myself to two. 
The first of Mr. Belloc's sketches deals with 
"The Royal Seance" of June 23, 1789. 
Somewhat unusual familiarity with the 
sources of this period puts me in position to 
judge of Mr. Belloc's methods of work and of 
the trustworthiness of his results. The work 
impresses me as being of the most uncritical 
and superficial character. In his account of 
the events of May 19, Mr. Belloc describes a 
midnight visit of Talleyrand to Marly, where 
a long interview took place between Talley- 
rand and the Comte d'Artois. The only evi- 
dence bearing upon the matter is found, so 
far as I am able to discover, in the Memoires 
of Talleyrand. Talleyrand writes of going to 



Marly, but does not mention any dates. 
Bacourt, his editor, reports in a note what he 
had heard about a call of Talleyrand upon 
the Comte d'Artois on the night of July 
15-16, and his account of that interview cor- 
responds exactly with Mr. Belloc's detailed 
account of the interview of June 19 at Marly. 
How could Mr. Belloc have made such a care- 
less blunder? The probable explanation does 
not increase one's confidence in his scholar- 
ship. In only one other secondary work have 
I ever found any reference to the presence of 
Talleyrand in Marly on the night of June 19 ; 
that work is Lord Acton's "Lectures on the 
French Revolution." He uses the incident in 
the same way, making the same blunder about 
the date that Mr. Belloc makes. Lord Acton 
undoubtedly used Bacourt's note. A com- 
parison of the text of Lord Acton's lectures 
with the text of Mr. Belloc's book makes clear 
that Mr. Belloc got his information from 
Lord Acton's work, reproducing part of it 
verbally without quotation marks. The two 
important things to note here are that the 
incident reported in detail by Mr. Belloc is 
not history, and that he did not take ordinary 
pains to determine whether it was or not. 
The trained historian, encountering that inci- 
dent for the first time in Lord Acton's pages, 
would " run it down " and discover that it 
was not true. It evidently never occurred to 
Mr. Belloc that the matter should be investi- 
gated. 

Mr. Belloc blunders again when he repeats 
after Lord Acton that the delegation of the 
clergy that went to Marly on the night of 
June 19 consisted of the archbishops of Paris 
and of Rouen ; the two sources I have before 
me say the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault and 
the Archbishop of Paris. 

The second example of " precision," and by 
far the worst bevue I have noticed, is found 
in the chapter on " The Storming of the Tuile- 
ries." Every schoolboy knows that on the 
morning of August 10 Louis XVI. left the 
chateau for the assembly before the chateau 
had been attacked by the people. Even Mr. 
Belloc must know this when he is not writing 
literary history! And yet, after describing 
the murderous fire of the Swiss guards and 
the retreat of the besiegers, he discovers Louis 
j "at his window, overlooking the still empty 
; inclosure beneath him"! Roederer is by his 
j side. " The Swiss guards still held the main 
| door of the Tuileries; the fire from its long 
i tiers of windows was still well nourished ; the 
muskets in the hands of the half -trained popu- 
lace were still regularly recharged and held 
their own. It was in this moment of doubt 
that Roederer, the politician who stood by

the king at his eastern window, said to Louis 
that it was the duty of a monarch not to risk 
the state." The king decided to leave the 
chateau and take refuge in the assembly. 
Then follows the description of the famous 
crossing of the garden through the fallen 
leaves. It was so difficult to believe that " the 
ablest living writer on these themes" could 
blunder like the veriest novice in recounting 
so well known an episode that I turned to the 
sources to assure myself that the traditional 
order of facts is correct. There was no mistake 
about it; Mr. Belloc's subconscious imagina- 
tion was once more interfering with his intel- 
lectual operations and falsifying the results. 
It seems to me that examples like these 
and they are only specimens justify my 
statement that Mr. Belloc is " constitutionally 
inaccurate." How much confidence can be 
placed in the historical work of a writer 
whose method is so bad, and who blunders so 
unconsciously in dealing with well-known 
facts? "Would a cautious student venture to 
use any "fact" found in his work without j 
having first verified it? Mr. Belloc has not, ; 
then, succeeded in producing a book that is 
at the same time a work of science and a work 
of art; he has not given us a sound piece of 
historical writing. FRED MORROW 



Along in the eighties there was a general 
arraignment of the fiction of the day. There 
was not so much fiction then as now, but j 
there was a good deal ; and a large part of it, j 
chiefly English, was widely circulated in the j 
paper-covered editions of the so-called " libra- | 
ries." There are many houses to-day where 
in the attic or in some closet you may still 
find piles of novels by William Black, L. B. 
Walford, W. E. Norris, and many others. 
These novels were undoubtedly interesting, 
but there arose a feeling that such stories 
they were likely to be stories of English so- 
ciety were rather tame. Then there set in 
a tide of tales of adventure, such as " The 
Wreck of the Grosvener," " King Solomon's 
Mines," " Treasure Island," and many more. 
People were delighted to read such things, 
and liked the feeling that they were literary. 

At the same time that the everyday novel 
was attacked as not being romantic enough, it

was also attacked as not being true enough 
to life. The last generation (like this) had 
many who became irritated, or angry, or dis- 
couraged, or perhaps merely disgusted or 
tired, at having life presented as attractive, 
sentimental, charming, and yet presented (so 
it was urged) in a superficial way that always 
avoided real truth. It might be true enough 
on the surface, it was said, but it did not get 
to the things that were important in the 
actual life people lived. Real life, many peo- 
ple felt, was so fine that anything in it, 
everything, in fact, had its beauty, and was 
at least better than the touched-up conven- 
tionalities that one could get at any after- 
noon tea or sewing-circle. So there came in 
a kind of realism (encouraged by foreign 
example), of which Mr. Hardy's "Jude the 
Obscure " is a good specimen. Mr. Hardy 
had made something of a sensation in select- 
ing Tess as his type of " a good woman." He 
now made a more vigorous sensation by the 
pig-killing episode and other things in " Jude 
the Obscure." 

This " reaction," as the histories of litera- 
ture would call it, produced many " realistic " 
books. It did not, however, do away with the 
kind of book from which it differed. There 
are many conventional " domestic " novels to- 
day of no especial importance ; but there are 
also a good many books which, without being 
domestic, appear to take life according to its 
obvious, popular, external characteristics, and 
some of them are worth noting. 

The late Hopkinson Smith's " Felix O'Day " 
is a book similar to those which caused the 
wrath of many a realist generations ago. It 
is almost generations ago that Mr. Smith told 
about Colonel Carter of Cartersville. That 
book and a number of others "Peter" and 
"Kennedy Square" will be best remembered 
presented with great sympathy and skill a 
"charming" view of life. So does "Felix 
O'Day." The story is quite impossible. The 
characters amount to little save as they are 
quaint and eccentric. The real thing is the 
atmosphere, the general feeling of life. 
There in New York, along Fourth Avenue, 
was a phase of life now passed away which 
Mr. Smith knew and loved. He liked to give 
pictures, sketches, impressions of places and 
people that he thought charming, sometimes 
in print, sometimes in paint. So he does here ; 
and just as people like his sketches of literary 
or artistic bits of London or Venice, so they 
will like his sketches of passing New York. 

Mrs. Burnett goes in for more than does 
Mr. Smith. She never is absolutely domestic 
any more than he, indeed, in "The Lost 
Prince" she is not domestic at all. But like

THE DIAL 



[ Nov. 25 



Mr. Smith, she always gives us a view of life 
which the realist calls superficial, sentimental, 
conventional, and other such things. No one, 
however, would call her work tame. A lit- 
tle mountainous country somewhere beyond 
Vienna, a picturesque and turbulent people, 
a rightful dynasty lost for centuries, a secret 
party (the most wonderful in the world) 
devoted to the lost prince, a silent wanderer, 
a military servant, a crippled street waif, a 
noble-minded boy trained by hardship to ser- 
vice, all this would certainly make a novel 
by Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim, if there were 
only a few suppers at the Hotel Milan. Cer- 
tainly it is not tame; and yet to one who 
has read anything about Servia of late, or 
indeed to anyone else, how wholly different 
from real life! 

Mrs. Burnett presumably would not for a 
moment urge that she has given an unvar- 
nished view of actuality in the Balkans or 
anywhere else. That has rarely been her 
way. But she has things to say : she thinks of 
characters, qualities, actions, that are real at 
bottom ; and if she presents them in a rather 
decorative manner, imaginative, somewhat 
conventionalized even, why, that is the way 
with many forms of art. Take the part about 
the Indian hermit. One may not be much 
impressed with the tale of the wanderings in 
the Himalayas ; but if the Indian Doctrine is 
true, there you are! "There are a myriad 
worlds. There is but One Thought out of 
which they grew. Its Law is Order which 
cannot swerve." If that is so, and one gets 
the impression strongly in Mrs. Burnett's ver- 
sion, so much the better. There you are: 
if there is a real idea at bottom, how much 
better than any number of other pictures of 
actual realities which all together give no idea 
of life, give nothing but a desultory series 
of impressions! 

Sir Gilbert Parker's " The Money Master " 
has an idea at bottom, too. One might imag- 
ine that at such a time as this, when a man is 
strained to the utmost to do as much for En- 
gland as man can do, one might imagine that 
a novel would be merely a sort of relief, an 
unbending in a way one can, when everything 
else is tense. But " The Money Master " is 
not merely a picture of old French life in 
Canada, though it is that too ; it has more to 
it. It will be admitted that the "more" is 
not at first obvious; the general setting is of 
the " charming " order. The peace and plenty 
of the Manor Chartier, the whimsical extrava- 
gance and practical business of Jean Jacques, 
the secret passion of his Spanish wife, all 
that seems as if we were to have little more 
than a romantic story which would hold our 



attention as we read, and then vanish, leav- 
ing a few pictures, one or two figures, which 
will be interesting or attractive but in their 
turn will vanish too. But as one goes on, the 
book takes more and more of a hold. Pic- 
tures of life or not, here is evidently some- 
thing worth having in mind and heart. The 
determination of the funny little philosopher- 
farmer or philosopher-financier is fine. He 
will be a philosopher, he will take the right 
view of life. At first, doubtless, he was wrong 
in thinking that one could get it from books, 
that one could pack it all in one's head. But 
in spite of misfortune, he is still a philoso- 
pher, " always, always, but in his heart, and 
not with his tongue." " His philosophy was 
the bent of a mind with a capacity to feel 
things rather than to think them." He un- 
derstands what the old Judge had meant 
when he said : " It is not vows that keep the 
world right, but the prayer of a man's soul 
from day to day." 

So we read Sir Gilbert's book, and so it 
seems a book worth reading. It has little to 
do with the war on the surface ; and yet who 
can fail to see that England now, and the 
whole world at any time, needs men and 
women who feel to the bone that life is more 
than opinions and resolves and arguments, 
that it is an affair of the soul ? And to press 
that point in one's book as well as one's life 
seems something worth doing; realistic, ro- 
mantic, these are but pedantic words if the 
thing be actually done. 

Miss Gather's "The Song of the Lark" is 
something different. On the face of it, it 
appears to be one of the biographies child- 
hood, education, love-affair or affairs, what- 
not else of which there are not a few 
nowadays. This time it is the story of a singer, 
as Mr. Beresford's latest book is the story of 
a novelist, Mr. Dreiser's of a "genius" at 
painting, Mr. Maugham's of one who was not 
a genius. But the form is not much, in 
fact, here it is not even a form (not even, 
like Logic, is it a dodge) ; it is hardly more 
than an excuse. Why tell us so much and no 
more? Why not tell everything? Why ever 
stop? Miss Gather or any other novelist 
would tell us that there must be just so 
much, no more, no less. The theory has 
been that such a book is to be the account of 
life (or a life) just as it is. That gives rea- 
son for anything. But here is a book where 
theories of form go for little. " It was a 
wondrous storm that drove me on " says the 
title-page, doubtless with truth. Miss Gather 
wants to give the soul of the artist, the sense 
of art, that something so impossible and so 
inevitable, which never explains itself, never

philosophizes, is perhaps never even conscious 
of what it is. Here we have a fine realization 
of the artist nature, a picture which stands 
for itself in its own way. Method and form 
are of little importance in so successful an 
achievement. 

So one need not say much about the realis- 
tic touch. To tell the truth, though there is 
much record of picture and event, there is 
much also that is not in that manner at all. 
Miss Gather explains a good deal. Often she 
shows us life and lets us get the impression; 
but often for some reason she does not do 
that, but merely tells us what the impression 
should be. She not only analyses, as they 
used to say, but she explains, as, for in- 
stance, that Thea found faithful friends in 
these good women, and that no musician ever 
had a better wife than Mrs. Harsanyi. There 
is much that is seen", but there is much that is 
not seen at all, and that with no apparent 
reason. Sometimes it is one way, sometimes 
another. One cannot understand the method. 
Why sometimes tell the fact and sometimes 
explain ? Why sometimes skip and sometimes 
not? 

In spite of all this, one must take the book 
on trust, as far as I can see. One might per- 
haps understand these matters with more 
study, or with more appreciation. But un- 
derstanding is likely to be the perfunctory 
task of the critic. The first thing to do is to 
get the experience; and then understanding 
and criticism, and so on, may be left to them- 
selves. And for anyone who will have it, 
here is certainly an experience such as one 
has all too rarely, even though there be 
several hundred novels this year, and among 
them a number that are excellent. Is it (as 
hinted) the experience of an upland garden 
in the windy dawn when the world seems 
young? I have never been in such a place, 
nor have I ever heard the song of the lark, 
at least not of the "unbodied joy whose race 
is just begun." It is not so much the feeling 
of life that I get here, as the sense of some- 
thing much less common than life: namely, 
art as it exists in life, a very curious and 
elusive thing, but so beautiful, when one gets 
it, that one forgets all else.

ART AND ARCHITECTURE. 

Other poets before Longfellow have felt the 
poetry of bridges, and other painters before Mr. 
Frank Brangwyn have discerned their artistic pos- 
sibilities, though it has remained for the eminent 
Royal Academician to devote a whole volume of 
generous proportions to their picturesque qualities 
as caught by the brush and in the soberer medium 
of pen-and-ink. "A Book of Bridges " (Lane) 
contains thirty-five reproductions of paintings and 
thirty-six black-and-white sketches, all by Mr. 
Brangwyn and all representing historic or other- 
wise notable bridges in Europe. Mr. Shaw Spar- 
row, known for his appreciative book on Mr. 
Brangwyn's art, supplies a descriptive and his- 
torical commentary to the pictures, a literary fea- 
ture that will appeal to many readers. Inevitably 
one looks for certain favorite bridges of one's own 
in this rich collection, and fails to find them. 
Even the Bridge of Sighs at Venice has failed to 
be favored with the artist's attentions; and the 
bridge spanning the Golden Horn and recently the 
object of a hostile assault that might have proved 
memorable does not appear. But the beautiful 
book has enough and more than enough to merit 
hearty commendation. 

Methods of illustration have a certain interest 
for everyone who reads or handles illustrated 
books or magazines; therefore such a work as 
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Pennell's "Lithography and 
Lithographers " (Macmillan) must appeal to many 
besides artists and craftsmen. In its historical 
portion the book is based upon the similar work 
by Mr. and Mrs. Pennell published in 1898 and 
now long out of print, but this part has been 
entirely rewritten and corrected by Mrs. Pennell, 
while the technical parts are the work of Mr. Pen- 
nell. Generous in its design and scope, this hand- 
some volume, quarto in size, is enriched with 
almost four-score notable examples of lithographic 
art, and that art itself is made the subject of 
eighteen carefully written chapters, tracing its 
development from its invention in 1798 by Alois 
Senefelder to the present time. Concerning the 
" Graphic Art Series," to which the book belongs, 
and which Mr. Pennell edits, he says in a brief 
foreword : " There are endless series of art books 

and endless schools of art, endless lectures on 
art and art criticism. But so far as I know there 
are no series of books on the graphic arts, written 
or edited by graphic artists. This series is in- 
tended to be a survey of the best work in the past 

the work that is admitted to be worth study- 
ing and a definite statement as to the best 
methods of making drawings, prints, and engrav- 
ings, written in every case by thos$ who have 
passed their lives in making them." Intelligibility, 
even to a layman, is a notable characteristic of 
the technical portions of the book.

sented in old houses and other buildings along our

eastern seaboard? Those who cannot arid they ; 
are sufficiently numerous will find means to 
repair their ignorance in " The Architecture of 
Colonial America" (Little, Brown & Co.), by 
Mr. Harold Donaldson Eberlein, with lavish illus- 
trations from photographs. First is considered the 
Dutch colonial type, then the New England colo- 
nial, the pre-Georgian of the middle colonies, the 
colonial architecture of the South, and so on 
through fourteen informing chapters. Like many 
other writers in this field, Mr. Eberlein deplores 
the havoc wrought by modern " improvers " of 
antique architecture, also " the relentless tide of 
mercantile progress," especially in New York City. 
Chapters on early American architects and their 
resources, and on the "materials and textures" 
that played so important a part in our early 
architecture, are added to the more customary 
topics of the book. It is a more scholarly, more 
systematic treatment of its theme than one often 
encounters. 

Melancholy associations necessarily link them- 
selves with Mr. Ralphl Adams Cram's "Heart of 
Europe" (Scribner), a sympathetic review of the 
former architectural glories of that war-scarred 
zone of northern Europe where no one yet knows 
with accuracy what small portions of the artist's 
and craftsman's handiwork have been spared by 
Mars, and still less what will in the end be found 
to have been spared. The frontispiece of the 
book, showing the incomparable facade of the 
Rheims cathedral, and later views of the Univer- 
sity of Louvain, the Cloth Hall of Ypres, the 
Hotel de Ville of Arras, and other masterpieces of 
the builder's hand, present in their beauty of form 
and richness of detail the strongest possible con- 
trast to their present ruinous aspect. But the 
author's reflections are not all sombre, by any 
means; and, even while admitting the irremedia- 
ble consequences of the war, he prophesies a 
nobler, a more sincere, a more consecrated art for 
the future, with a new realization of the very 
nature and function of art. His book covers a 
far wider range than that within which the ordi- 
nary writer on the war or any of its aspects con- 
fines himself. The pictures, from photographs, 
are many and good. 

The splendid country places of California mil- 
lionaires a round dozen of them are pre- 
sented to the eye of imagination and to the eye 
of sense in Mr. Porter Garnett's " Stately Homes 
of California" (Little, Brown & Co.), the book 
itself being a stately quarto of luxurious appoint- 
ments, including twenty-five colored and uncolored 
plates, the product of the camera combined with 
various processes known to mechanical art. Exte- 
rior and occasional interior views are given of 
palatial mansions owned by Mr. James L. Flood, 
Mr. H. E. Huntington, Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst, 
Mr. James D. Phelan, and others on whom for- 
tune has visibly smiled. Both the author and his 
sponsor (Mr. Bruce Porter, who contributes an 
Introduction) reveal their passion for gardens, 
and there is much good garden-description in the 
book, with a grace of style rather unusual in lit- 
erature of this sort. The spacious plan of the 



volume, with its wide margins and its clear and 
uncrowded print, is entirely in harmony with its 
theme. 

Who that has ever attended or even heard about 
the old-fashioned quilting-bee, who that has ever 
slept under or seen an old-fashioned quilt, will 
refuse to cast a kindly eye on Miss Marie D. 
Webster's " Quilts : Their Story and How to 
Make Them" (Doubleday) ? Back to ancient 
Egypt and its relics of patchwork in colored goat- 
skins she goes for the beginnings of quilt-making 
and for the first illustration (after the frontis- 
piece) in her elaborately illustrated book. Mu- 
seums and ancestral chests have evidently been 
ransacked for material with which to enrich her 
chapters, and it appears that she has gained 
unusual familiarity with her subject from dealing, 
in a business way, with the quilt-pattern-buying 
public. Similar in design to Mrs. Eliza Calvert 
Hall's admirable work, "A Book of Hand-woven 
Coverlets," this treatise will please many of the 
author's sex, if not also a few mere men. The 
many handsome designs shown in color or in black- 
and-white are notably superior, in aesthetic qual- 
ity, to the stiffly geometrical patterns so common 
in the bed-coverings of our grandparents. Some 
conception of the possibilities of Miss Webster's 
theme may be gained from the mere fact that her 
appended list of quilt names has nearly five 
hundred entries. 

Introducing " The Art Treasures of Great Brit- 
ain" (Dutton), Mr. C. H. Collins Baker, editor 
of the handsome quarto, refers somewhat vaguely 
to a series, of which this work seems to form a 
part, though no number is assigned to it, and no 
series name appears on the title-page or else- 
where. Also, in saying that "had circumstances 
permitted the extension if not completion of this 
publication other living masters would have been 
represented," Mr. Baker implies in the same 
indefinite manner that his work is but a fragment 
and that no continuation is contemplated. Both 
public and private collections are represented in 
the fifty-six plates, mostly in " rotogravure," con- 
stituting the bulk of the volume, and the excel- 
lence of these reproductions is beyond dispute; 
but the arrangement seems to be without system, 
periods and schools and subjects mingling in care- 
less comradeship. A page of explanatory text 
accompanies each plate. The volume has much in 
it to delight an art-lover and to make him regret 
the non-completion of the series and the following 
out of a plan more intelligible than any that is 
discernible in the present work. 

Many persons of refined taste and peculiar 
force of character confess a fondness for f restoring 
and refurbishing the old, in preference to con- 
structing the new. The late Jacob A. Riis had 
this passion, and frankly acknowledged it. How 
far it has been carried in the fashioning of more 
or less luxurious country residences may partly 
be gathered from turning the leaves of Miss Mary 
H. Northend's richly illustrated volume, " Remod- 
eled Farmhouses" (Little, Brown & Co.), wherein 
more than a score of these modernized relics of a 
ruder age are elaborately presented to our inspec-

tion. As in her earlier books devoted to domestic 
architecture, it is New England with its wealth of 
interesting old houses that here claims the writer's 
attention. Some of her restored farmhouses are 
wonders of up-to-date comfort and even luxury; 
others retain more of their original simplicity; 
but all are attractive. It is a valuable book for 
the home-maker of means and taste. 

As Rome has been called the most religious city 
in the world because of her many churches, so she 
might also be called the cleanest by reason of her 
numerous fountains. With this remark Mrs. 
Charles MacVeagh opens her notable volume on 
" Fountains of Papal Rome" (Scribner), in 
which are told the stories of a score or more of 
these acceptable and beautiful gifts to the people. 
" Pagan emperors and Christian popes alike," she 
says, " have found both profit and pleasure in add- 
ing another fountain or in making or repairing 
one more aqueduct to give a still greater supply 
of water to the Roman populace. No other peo- 
ple, with the possible exception of the Spanish 
Moors, have so appreciated the value and the 
beauty of abundant water." A pleasing departure 
from the usual order is found in the wood engrav- 
ings, by Mr. Rudolph Ruzicka, of most of the 
fountains described in the book. Appended in- 
scriptions, chronological tables, and alphabetical 
index of architects, sculptors, painters, and engrav- 
ers mentioned by Mrs. MacVeagh, add to the use- 
fulness of her carefully prepared work. 

Mr. Joseph Pennell went to Greece in the 
spring of 1913 for two reasons: first, to see the 
country and what remained of its ancient glory, 
to see whether " the greatest work of the past " 
would impress him " as much as the greatest work 
of the present and to find out which was the 
greater " ; and second, he says, " I went because 
I was told by a Boston authority that I was noth- 
ing but a ragtime sketcher, couldn't see Greek art 
and couldn't draw it if I did." Whether the 
accusation was true or false the public is invited 
to judge after inspecting the handsome volume 
that resulted from that visit. " Joseph Pennell's 
Pictures in the Land of Temples " (Lippincott) 
presents forty views of famous ruins, chiefly in 
Greece, with some Greek ruins in Sicily and south- 
ern Italy. Preliminary remarks and interspersed 
brief notes from the artist's pen contribute to the 
interest of the book. It is made quite plain by 
Mr. Pennell that one need not be a Greek scholar 
in order to appreciate Greek architecture and 
reproduce something of its charm with the pencil. 

In this country alone there are said to be thirty 
thousand paintings bearing the signature of Corot, 
real or forged; and as he is believed to have pro- 
duced not more than eight thousand pictures 
(enough for one man, surely) in his half-century 
of activity, most of these thirty thousand alleged 
Corots must be imitations. But in any event there 
ought to be wide-spread interest in this country in 
Corot and his fellow-artists of the Barbizon 
School. To this interest ministers Mr. Arthur 
Hoeber, Associate of the National Academy of 
Design, in his well-planned and well-executed 
work, "The Barbizon Painters" (Stokes), which 



contains readable chapters on Millet, Corot, Diaz, 
Dupre, Troyon, Rousseau, Daubigny, and Charles 
Jacque, with many examples of each artist's style 
reproduced in sepia. Excepting Mr. David C. 
Thomson's book on " The Barbizon School of 
Painters," published twenty-five years ago and 
now out of print, there seems to be nothing in the 
field to rival Mr. Hoeber's present volume, which 
is a delight to the eye as well as a satisfaction to 
the inquiring reader. 

A thirty-six years' residence in Mexico has 
enabled Mrs. John Wesley Butler to familiarize 
herself with the more famous of the historic cathe- 
drals and other church buildings in that land so 
rich in houses of worship and so poor in the condi- 
tion of most of the worshippers. " Historic 
Churches in Mexico" (Abingdon Press), which is 
the fruit of some of these visits to various parts of 
the country, devotes four of its twelve chapters 
to churches of Mexico City, and the remaining 
eight to those of other cities. The faithful camera 
furnishes nearly fifty good illustrations to help 
out the descriptive matter. Noticeable in many of 
these pictures is the almost barbaric wealth of 
ornament characteristic of Mexican church archi- 
tecture. Present turbulent conditions beyond our 
southern border make such a book as Mrs. Butler's 
more welcome than a free excursion ticket to the 
land of the Aztecs. 

Five books that gain their peculiar interest 
from the greater of the two Panama expositions 
come from the publishing house of Messrs. Paul 
Elder & Co., San Francisco. The pleasing pattern 
of their artistic design stamps them at once as 
products of that establishment. Brown-tinted 
paper, delicate illustrations in tint, beautiful 
though simple bindings protected by wrappers of 
corresponding hue, and, best of all, the clearest of 
well-proportioned type these are among the 
commendable features that attract the eye at the 
very outset. " The Lure of San Francisco " is a 
small volume by two sisters, Mrs. Elizabeth Gray 
Potter and Miss Mabel Thayer Gray. Its object 
is to " aid in the general awaking of the dormant 
love of every Californian for his possessions and 
be a suggestion to the casual visitor that we are 
entitled to the dignity of age." From beginning 
to end it preserves the form of a dialogue between 
the narrator and a visiting Bostonian, who finds 
himself justly rebuked for saying " Frisco " by 
hearing his own beloved city called " Bost," and 
is in many other ways brought to a recognition of 
the dignity and historic importance of the scenes 
before him. The four chapters deal successively 
with " The Mission and its Romance," " The Prae- 
sidio, Past and Present," " The Plaza and its 
Echoes," and " Telegraph Hill of Unique Fame." 
Eight appropriate drawings are interspersed. In 
two somewhat larger volumes, well supplied with 
full-page plates from photographs, -the Panama- 
Pacific Exposition's appeal to the eye of the art- 
lover is exemplified and commented upon. " The 
Art of the Exposition " presents " personal im- 
pressions of the architecture, sculpture, mural 
decorations, color scheme, and other aesthetic 
aspects " of the great exhibition ; while " The

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 25 



Galleries of the Exposition " gives " a critical 
review of the paintings, statuary, and the graphic 
arts in the Palace of Fine Axis " at the same 
international show. Both books owe their being 
to Professor Eugen Neuhaus, teacher of decora- 
tive design in the University of California, mem- 
ber of the exposition's jury of awards in the 
department of fine arts, and chairman of the 
Western Advisory Committee. He speaks from 
fulness of knowledge, and has made a judicious 
selection of objects to be illustrated in his hand- 
some volumes. General and particular views of 
Panama Exposition architecture and landscape 
gardening are presented in a volume prefaced by 
Mr. Louis Christian Mullgardt, architect of the 
Court of Ages and member of the Architectural 
Commission of the exposition, and briefly anno- 
tated by competent hands. The illustrations, 
nearly one hundred beautiful examples of photo- 
graphic art, occupy the right-hand pages, the 
descriptive notes the left-hand. The title is " The 
Architecture and Landscape Gardening of the 
Exposition." An aesthetically satisfying little 
paper book, with stiff cover and wrapper, and 
calling itself " Palace of Fine Arts and Lagoon," 
gives a short description, by Mr. Bernard R. May- 
beck, of these two features of the exposition, with 
a three-page introduction by Mr. Frank Morton 
Todd, and two illustrations. It is a pleasing 
souvenir of an unpretentious sort. 

TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

Mr. H. G. Dwight has " as little patience as 
possible with the Gladstonian theory of the un- 
speakable Turk," and is therefore in a frame of 
mind (and heart) to write with sympathetic 
understanding of the native inhabitants of Con- 
stantinople, where he has lived long enough to 
acquire an intimate knowledge of that strange and 
little-known city. "Constantinople, Old and New" 
(Scribner) is, as its title indicates, both historical 
and descriptive, exhibiting the real, Turkish Stam- 
boul as few writers of western Europe are quali- 
fied to exhibit it, and bringing the narrative down 
to the eventful and, to the Turk, humiliating days 
of the late Balkan wars. A laudable desire to 
produce a book comparable with Mr. Howells's 
" Venetian Life " has animated the author, though 
he modestly admits the difficulty of its attainment. 
As a matter of fact, his work is much more com- 
prehensive, much more imposing in its material 
aspects, with its broad pages and innumerable 
illustrations (from photographs), and its equip- 
ment of bibliography and index and chronological 
table of rulers. It is a book of peculiar timeliness 
and also of enduring merits. 

Mr. Francis E. Leupp has had every oppor- 
tunity to learn well the Washington that has been 
for many years his home and the scene of his offi- 
cial and journalistic activities. Hence he writes 
with ease and a chatty f amiliarity in his " Walks 
about Washington " (Little, Brown & Co.), a book 
of historic and perhaps also fabulous anecdote, 
such as the well-known features of one's own city 
would call forth from any communicative pedes- 
trian of the requisite powers of memory and nar- 



ration. It is not, however, personal experience 
and first-hand narrative that fills the bulk of the 
book. The historians and memoir-writers have 
been called to his aid, and he avails himself of 
their assistance with skill and grace. His readable 
chapters are generously and tastefully illustrated 
with line drawings by Mr. Lester G. Hornby. Not 
the least of the book's attractions is its inclusion 
of a goodly number of not too stale Lincoln anec- 
dotes and allusions. 

To visit with Mr. Norman Douglas the birth- 
place of Horace (Venosa, the ancient Venusia), to 
stroll with him amid Italian scenes made especially 
notable by memories of George Gissing, and to 
enjoy throughout these and other rambles in the 
toe of Italy the conductor's rich fund of humorous 
or learned allusion and reminiscence this is the 
pleasure offered to readers of " Old Calabria " 
(Houghton). The simplicity of the native Cala- 
brians, their childlike faith in matters of religion, 
is illustrated by anecdotes. One woman of the 
country took pains to explain to the benighted 
visitor that the saints in heaven take their food 
exactly as do mortals on earth, and at the same 
hours. " The same food 1 " was the incredulous 
rejoinder. "Does the Madonna really eat beans'?" 
"Beans'? Not likely! But fried fish, and beef- 
steaks of veal." Unable to declare himself con- 
vinced, Mr. Douglas suffered the humiliation of 
being considered a pagan. A notable chapter 
entitled " Milton in Calabria " deserves more ex- 
tended mention than is here possible. The book is 
full of readable and often unusual matter. Illus- 
trations from photographs abound. 

Mrs. Hugh Fraser, like her late brother, F. 
Marion Crawford, loves her adopted Italy and 
is steeped in its lore. "Storied Italy" (Dodd), 
from her pen, is a collection of personal memories 
and historical retrospects relating chiefly to Rome 
and more or less noted Romans. These reminis- 
cences and studies are to her, she says, a refuge 
from the trouble and pain of the modern world. 
Accordingly she devotes four chapters of some 
length to the holy life and charitable labors of 
St. Frances of Rome, whom she styles a " Romana 
di Roma," and the details of whose history are 
apparently drawn from the biography written with 
much fulness by her father confessor immediately 
after her death. Other parts of Mrs. Fraser's 
book have more of her own vivid experiences, so 
that the volume is saved from the danger of too 
much mediaeval or other ancient lore. It is well 
illustrated, with colored frontispiece and half-tone 
plates on the whole a fitting supplement to the 
same writer's " Italian Yesterdays." 

Mr. Stephen Gwynn, who has already testified 
in print to his love of his native Ireland, gives 
further vent to his enthusiasm for Old Erin in a 
series of chapters, historic and descriptive, on 
"The Famous Cities of Ireland" (Macmillan). 
Eleven familiar names, rich in manifold associa- 
tions, head these chapters, videlicet: Waterford, 
Dundalk, Galway, Maynooth, Kilkenny, Derry, 
Limerick, Dublin, Wexford, Cork, and Belfast. It 
was Galway that sent Mr. Gwynn to Parliament 
in 1906, and it is therefore fitting enough that to 



1915]

Galway should be accorded more space than to 
any of her sister cities except Dublin and Water- 
ford. Characteristic of this loyal Irishman is it 
that he should write of " Derry," not of " London- 
derry." A frivolous seeker for amusement might 
have wished that he had enlivened his Kilkenny 
chapter with some allusion to the famous cats of 
that town. Mr. Hugh Thomson vividly and 
humorously illustrates the book, partly in color, 
and even more enjoyably in his free and spirited 
pen-and-ink drawings. 

Vacation in Europe is becoming next to impossi- 
ble for travelling Americans, and so their attention 
is turned, more than ever before, to the vaca- 
tional possibilities at home. " In Vacation Amer- 
ica" (Harper), by Mr. Harrison Rhodes, with 
pleasing illustrations in color by Mr. Howard 
Giles, is designed to furnish hints and useful 
information to the sort of vacationers that would 
in happier times seek to lighten the burden of 
existence by going to Europe, unmindful of the 
Horatian maxim that keeps the wise from chasing 
happiness in foreign lands. Not at all in guide- 
book style, but in familiar, chatty, anecdotal vein, 
the author touches on some of the delights await- 
ing the visitor to our coast and inland resorts, our 
summer and winter scenes of holiday-making. It 
is a small book, and good reading even for the 
stay-at-home. 

Mr. Jack London's adventurous voyage in the 
Snark from San Francisco to Hawaii, and thence 
to the islands of the South Pacific Ocean, has 
already been related in his characteristic manner 
in " The Cruise of the Snark." Now Mrs. Jack 
London (Charmian Kittredge London is the way 
she signs her name) tells the same story in her 
feminine and more voluble fashion under the sim- 
ilar title of "The Log of the Snark" (Macmil- 
lan), her narrative taking the form of a diary 
covering the eighteen months from April, 1907, to 
October, 1908. That the thrill of danger was not 
wanting to complete the charm of this eventful 
cruise is proved by concluding references to cer- 
tain cannibal incidents in islands visited by the 
Snark. "And, believe it or not," are the writer's 
closing words, " ye of little faith in the joy that 
was ours on the voyage, our one ultimate hope of 
earthly bliss is to fit out another and larger boat, 
and do it all over again, and more and do it 
more leisurely, more wisely under the tropic sun." 
Thus does Mrs. London show herself a fit mate 
for her roving author-husband. The book is fully 
illustrated from photographs. 

Australia, New Guinea, Thursday Island, and 
sundry other regions, form the successive scenes 
of the incidents and conversations related by Mr. 
Norman Duncan in his "Australian Byways : The 
Narrative of a Sentimental Traveler" (Harper). 
Not the popular resorts, not the great cities or the 
things set down in the guide-books, have attracted 
this wanderer, but rather the remote and out-of- 
the-way places accessible only by the slower, more 
primitive modes of conveyance. Yet there is no 
lack of human intercourse in the narrated expe- 
riences; in fact, the pages are enlivened with 
conversation from beginning to end. Among other 



wonders, the exploits of the native Australian 
trackers are described, and we have a glimpse of 
the Papuan tree-dwellers, while here and there 
we make the acquaintance of some exceptionally 
remarkable " aborigine," as the author has the 
courage to call him. The " sentimental " element 
promised on the title-page is nowhere conspicuous, 
one is not sorry to note. It is a brisk and varied 
narrative, well illustrated with both colored and 
plain pictures by Mr. George Harding. 

As the best teacher of a foreign language is 
often the outsider who appreciates from hard 
experience the peculiar difficulties of that lan- 
guage, so the most illuminating commentator on a 
foreign country and its institutions is likely to be 
the observer from without who has won his way 
with some effort to a true comprehension of his 
theme. Professor Arthur Reade, Lecturer in 
English at the University of Helsingfors, brings to 
the writing of his book, " Finland and the Finns " 
(Dodd) the vivid impressions of a visitor and also 
the more accurate knowledge of a dweller in the 
land he undertakes to describe. His chapters, far 
from being descriptive of externalities, deal with 
such important topics as the national movement, 
the racial struggle, education, painting and music, 
literary landmarks, the rights of women, political 
parties, the first and second periods of Russianiza- 
tion, and Finland's position in the Russian Empire. 
The expected pictorial accompaniment, in color 
and in monotone, is not lacking. It is a timely 
book and, better still, a trustworthy one or so it 
impresses us. 

Long ago Stevenson made it plain to a host of 
delighted readers that there are unexhausted and 
inexhaustible possibilities of pleasure in a small 
boat and a few accommodating rivers and canals. 
"An Inland Voyage " may have suggested to Mr. 
and Mrs. Lewis Chase their recent adventure in 
"A Vagabond Voyage through Brittany" (Lip- 
pincott), an aquatic saunter from St. Malo to 
Rennes and thence to Brest, chiefly by canal, with 
two short stretches of river to complete the tour. 
Mrs. Chase is the chronicler of the voyage, and she 
adorns her tale with sixty-four views from photo- 
graphs, all interesting and som.e unusually pleas- 
ing. One needs only to have read Blanche Willis 
Howard's " Guenn " to become convinced of the 
quaint attraction of Brittany; and this attraction 
loses none of its force in Mrs. Chase's handling of 
her theme. It is a book to make one wish to dupli- 
cate the author's experiences when peace shall 
have settled once more over the fair face of 
France. A good map accompanying the narra- 
tive points the way for any such emulous reader. 

RECORDS OP THE PAST. 

How the Concord celebrities looked to their 
fellow-townsmen is entertainingly indicated in the 
" retrospective " portion of Mr. Allen French's 
"Old Concord" (Little, Brown & Co.), an intelli- 
gently sympathetic treatment of a perennially 
interesting theme by a resident and lover of the 
historic town. To Hawthorne's neighbors, we read, 
the modestly reserved author was a queer man 
who " was becoming celebrated, so people heard,

from his book about a scarlet letter; but he was 
so unsocial that he took to the woods when people 
came to visit him. Did n't he use to stand in his 
garden at the Manse and dream, in full sight of 
the road, instead of working? The man lived in a 
dream ! " When Emerson's little son showed him 
some pictures of the public square of his own 
town, the dreamer actually asked what place it 
was, though he had passed through it hundreds of 
times. The remaining chapters of the book are 
headed "Military Affairs," "Chiefly Literary," 
and " The Burying Grounds." Thirty excellent 
drawings are supplied by Mr. Lester G. Hornby. 
Useful as a guide, but without the guide-book's 
lack of literary charm, " Old Concord " is a good 
book to own and, above all, to read. 

Zealous in promoting the good name and fame of 
his beloved State, Mr. Sherman Williams prefaces 
his "New York's Part in History" (Appleton) 
with some comparisons to prove that Massachu- 
setts and Bunker Hill and the Boston Massacre 
do not necessarily stand for bigger things than 
New York and Oriskany (where, he affirms, Bur- 
goyne's fate was really settled) and the so-called 
Battle of Golden Hill (in which American patriots 
and British soldiers came to blows nearly two 
months before the historic " massacre " in Boston). 
Other comparisons to the advantage of New Yor 1 : 
appear in the preface, and furnish matter for 
more extended treatment in the body of the book. 
In a word, the memorable achievements of this 
commonwealth in war and also in peace are ably 
and eloquently presented in seventeen stirring 
chapters, with abundant pictorial accompaniment 
and eight maps. 

Puritanical Boston's famous old theatre under 
another name (the Boston Museum and Gallery of 
Fine Arts) was for more than half a century a 
purveyor of innocent entertainment to good people 
who would have been shocked at the suggestion of 
going to a regular playhouse. No stock company 
in America has enjoyed for so long a period so 
enviable a repute. But it was too good to last, 
and comparatively few of the present century have 
any personal knowledge of the Boston Museum 
and its wholesome delights. To those few, and we 
hope to many others, Miss Kate Ryan's " Old 
Boston Museum Days" (Little, Brown & Co.) 
will be a treat. Miss Ryan (we follow the lead 
of her title-page and give her the name by which 
she was known on the stage) joined the Museum 
company in 1872 and remained with it until its 
disbandment in 1893, and thus is admirably quali- 
fied to write about the old playhouse in its well- 
matured prime. It is the personally reminiscent 
character of her book that makes it so enjoyable. 
Good stories, often amusing, as such anecdotes 
commonly are, abound; and all the old favorites 
of the famous company live once more in her 
pages. They are also presented in photo-engrav- 
ings. Not to be able to find enjoyment in such a 
book is to be an object of pity. 

A volume of nearly five hundred closely printed 
pages is added to the " Great Nations " series in j 
evidence of the magnitude, historical if not geo- j 
graphical, of that rugged corner of Great Britain ! 



known to the Romans as Britannia Secunda. 
" Wales, her Origins, Struggles, and Later His- 
tory, Institutions, and Manners" (Stokes), by 
Mr. Gilbert Stone, presents the history of this 
romantic land of the Celts in a manner agreeably 
at variance with the conventional style of history- 
writing. Not the rulers and the wars they waged are 
made the prominent features of the narrative, but 
rather the people and their habits and institutions, 
with all that goes to make up the civilization (or 
to mark the lack of it) of a nation strongly defined 
in its distinguishing characteristics. Even more 
fully than J. R. Green in his " History of the 
English People," Mr. Stone enters into the details 
of daily life, manners and customs and culture, of 
the folk about whom he writes. From the dim 
" origins " to the union with England the story of 
this gallant nation is traced, with many good 
illustrations to help out the text. 

How America impressed our French visitors in 
the last quarter of the eighteenth century, when 
Lafayette and other less illustrious Frenchmen ob- 
tained more than a bowing acquaintance with our 
ancestors of that period, may be agreeably learned 
from Mr. Charles H. Sherrill's " French Memories 
of Eighteenth-Century America" (Scribner). An 
old mahogany sofa treasured by the Sherrill fam- 
ily, a piece of furniture on which the above- 
named general is said to have sat more than once, 
started the author on his study of French memoirs 
relating to early American life and manners; and 
hence the present book. Nearly ninety names 
appear in his appended list of " French authori- 
ties consulted and records examined," and a respec- 
table array of " authorities in English " follows. 
The book treats of such matters as costume, con- 
versation, cards, etiquette, dancing, courtship and 
marriage, food and drink, city life and country 
life, education, newspapers, professions and indus- 
tries, and, in fact, a remarkably wide range of 
further subjects. Many illustrations from con- 
temporary sources are inserted. 

Wellesley's memorable fire of last year awak- 
ened such an interest in the plucky little college 
(no longer so little, however) as had never before 
been felt. The rapid recovery from this disaster 
gave evidence of Wellesley's vigorous vitality 
the vitality of comparative youth, for the college 
is but forty years old. These forty years, how- 
ever, contain a wealth of notable history, a chapter 
of no little significance in the larger story of 
female education ; and this chapter is now written 
by a Wellesley graduate, Miss Florence Converse. 
" The Story of Wellesley " (Little, Brown & Co.) 
is embellished with graceful drawings by Mr. Nor- 
man Irving Black, which form a fit accompani- 
ment to Miss Converse's careful narrative. But it 
is somewhat unexpected not to find in a work of 
this kind a single portrait of past president or 
beloved professor. Things, not persons build- 
ings, not the occupants of chairs in those buildings 
are chosen for illustration. 

Fitting enough is it that the present revival of 
the pageant should bring us books in which the 
attempt is made to present a pictorial and, as far 
as possible, a verbal pageant of the subjects

treated. Dr. J. Edward Parrott's truly gorgeous 
volume, " The Pageant of British History " (Sully 
& Kleinteich) is a rather conspicuous attraction 
of its sort this season. The narrative, covering the 
chief events in England's history from the earliest 
times to the close of Queen Victoria's reign, is in 
the simple and attractive style of Dickens's sim- 
ilar work for young readers; and the numerous 
pictures are from famous artists, such as Turner, 
Alma-Tadema, Orchardson, and Maclise. Nothing 
short of splendid is the brilliant appearance of 
the colored plates; the black-and-white, if not 
preferred by any large majority of readers, will 
at least serve as a grateful relief to the eyes. A 
scant two pages is devoted to " Edward the Peace- 
maker," and the book closes with only the briefest 
mention of his successor's accession. 

BIOGRAPHY AND MEMOIRS. 

"My labor, like my life, is drawing toward a 
close. It has, from first to last, been devoted to 
one service, to the Ministry of Beauty. That is 
the consummate agency of civilization, and that 
should be the supreme purpose of all art." Thus 
writes Mr. William Winter, our dean of dramatic 
critics, our much loved poet and genial man of 
letters, in his latest volume of reminiscences, 
" Vagrant Memories " ( Doran ) . Naturally enough, 
and very acceptably to the reader, these memories 
are almost wholly of famous players, a baker's 
dozen of them, with a chapter on Augustin Daly, 
friend and patron of players, thrown in for good 
measure. A fine tribute to William Warren, with 
the poem that Mr. Winter wrote and recited in his 
honor on the occasion of his completing half a 
century on the stage, opens the book; a char- 
acteristic and in every -way admirable discourse 
on " The Theatre and Morality " closes it ; while 
between the two stand notable personal recollec- 
tions and anecdotes of Laura Keene, Matilda 
Heron, Lester Wallack, the Booths, Irving, and 
others, including three living representatives of 
the stage. Though the author admits that praise 
of the past and despondency over the present have 
always been indulged in by men of advanced 
years, he believes this present day of ours pecu- 
liarly and exceptionally bad in many respects, and 
especially in things theatrical as if the same 
lament had not been raised ever since the first 
theatre was built. But he regards the evil as a 
passing aberration only, and optimistically looks 
for better things in the future, which the typical 
croaker never does. Therefore his pages are to be 
heartily commended as almost equally cheering 
and entertaining; they register the gold days, not 
the gray, of the writer. The usual rich accom- 
paniment of illustrations, chiefly portraits, is to 
be found in this welcome addition to Mr. Winter's 
works. 

Unsparingly, withholding no sordid or distress- 
ing detail, Maxim Gorky (his real name is Alexei 
Maximovitch Peshkof ) tells the story of his early 
years in "My Childhood" (Century Co.), and at 
the outset he defends his pitiless realism by say- 
ing : " But truth is ' stronger than pity, and 
besides, I am writing not about myself but about 
that narrow, stifling environment of unpleasant 



impressions in which lived aye, and to this day 
lives the average Russian of this class." It is, 
however, about himself primarily that he writes, 
and he does so with astonishing frankness and 
with the vivid force of a born artist in narration. 
Revolting, though fascinating, many of his pages 
must in truth be styled. The following is a de- 
scription of the writer's school costume : " I went 
thither in mother's shoes, with a coat made out of 
a bodice belonging to grandmother, a yellow shirt, 
and trousers which had been lengthened. My 
attire immediately became an object of ridicule, 
and for the yellow shirt I received ' The ace of 
diamonds.' " His great pity and tenderness for 
all suffering, and a sense of fellowship with the 
sufferers, were first awakened by a cruel flogging 
from his inhuman grandfather. The reminiscences 
end with the death of the writer's mother and 
his own going forth into the world. The transla- 
tion, a vigorous performance, is from an unnamed 
hand, and an unnamed artist supplies illustrations. 
Facing the title-page is a portrait of the author, 
from a photograph. All who like Russian realism 
of an unflinching intensity will delight in this 
book. 

" Court Life from Within " (Dodd) is made up 
of the chapters of bright and informal chat about 
royal and imperial personages and their surround- 
ings that have in the last two years entertained 
many magazine readers and inspired them with a 
decided liking for the frankly democratic royal 
writer, the Infanta Eulalia of Spain. That a 
member of the Bourbon and Hapsburg families, 
and one reared amid the strict formalities of the 
Spanish court, should display such an understand- 
ing and appreciation of democratic ideals and cus- 
toms, is something not to be passed over without 
remark even in the hastiest reading of her book. 
Again and again she holds up to good-natured 
ridicule the inane pomposities of court life, and 
in the heaven-anointed German Kaiser especially 
she finds food for her fun-making. His belief in 
his divine right as sovereign, and his very con- 
spicuous " religiosity " evoke her caustic comment, 
if one may apply so strong an adjective to her 
gracious and graceful manner of expression. The 
book is ornately bound and well illustrated. 

The Princess Lazarovich Hrebelianovich 
known before her marriage to the Serbian states- 
man above-named as Miss Eleanor Calhoun is 
not only the grand-niece of a famous man (John 
C. Calhoun) but also famous in her own right. 
Both London and Paris applauded and feted her

Shakespearean parts and with Sir Johnston 
Forbes-Robertson, Mounet-Sully, and Coquelin. 
From the rich store of reminiscences that she has 
put into writing, and of which some foretaste has 
already been vouchsafed to the reading public, 
selected chapters now appear in book form under 
the title, "Pleasures and Palaces" (Century Co.),

came to know it as a young American actress with 
keen perceptions and an eager desire to see as 
much as possible of the great world. Representa-

tives of royalty and nobility, of authorship and 
art, of statesmanship and diplomacy, crowd her 
pages, which seem to contain not a dull para- 
graph or line. A notable chapter describes the 
writer's planning and execution of " the first f or- 
rest production," as she calls it, of "As You Like 
It," in Coombe Wood Grove, Surrey. Many pho- 
tographs and drawings, the latter by Mr. John 
Wolcott Adams, adorn the book. 

After the death of the Rev. Laurence Henry 
Schwab, who was to have been the authorized 
biographer of the late Bishop Potter, the task 
was entrusted to Dean Hodges, of the Episcopal 
Theological School at Cambridge; and with Mr. 
Schwab's accumulated material to help him, and 
his own peculiar fitness for the work, it was a 
virtual certainty that he would produce a worthy 
memorial of Dr. Potter and a notable piece of 
biographical writing. In the case of one whose 
energies were so unreservedly devoted to the 
church as were Henry Codman^ Potter's, the biog- 
rapher's labors must concern themselves largely 
with the history of the church as interwoven with 
the professional activities of the man. Thus we 
have in Dean Hodges's book not so much a per- 
sonal portrait as a chapter from the annals of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church, though it is a chap- 
ter in which the personality of Bishop Potter 
stands conspicuously forth. In his record of 
biographical details a record not supremely 
important, it. is true the writer might have 
shown more scrupulous accuracy. For instance, 
on his second page he makes Alonzo Potter 
(father of the subject of his book) marry Sarah 
Maria Nott in 1823; and on page ten he places 
this marriage in 1824. Portraits accompany the 
text, and an index is appended. The book is 
entitled "Henry Codman Potter, Seventh Bishop 
of New York," and it is published by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

The frail objects of royalty's errant affections 
have a strong attraction for Mr. H. Noel Williams, 
who this season gives us some readable chapters on 
those court beauties of the Restoration, Nell Gwyn, 
Louise de Kerouaille, and Hortense Mancini 
"Rival Sultanas," as the book's title designates 
them. The Merry Monarch's fair favorites played 
so conspicuous a part in the social and political 
life of their period as to invest them with a his- 
toric importance not always possessed by king's 
mistresses. Hence the ease with which Mr. Wil- 
liams spins out his tale to the extent of nearly 
four hundred pages. Ten of Sir Peter Lely's 
sleekly graceful productions in portraiture, with 
fifteen similar works of art by Sir Godfrey Kneller 
and others, have been made use of in illustrating 
the book, which is offered to the American public 
by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 

The romance and tragedy of Camille Desmou- 
lins's life and death, and the heroic bearing with 
which his young wife followed her adored husband 
to the guillotine, are the subject of Miss Violet 
Methley's " Camille Desmoulins" (Dutton), a sub- 
stantial octavo divided into four parts bearing the 
somewhat fanciful headings, " The North Wind," 
" The West Wind," " The East Wind," and " The 



South Wind." The abundance of French memoirs 
and other published material relating to the event- 
ful period of Desmoulins's public activity makes 
it no difficult undertaking to produce a readable 
account of the man, and authentic portraits of him 
by contemporary artists are not wanting for the 
suitable illustration of such a book. In its appeal 
to the reader's sympathies this biography is skil- 
fully written; it certainly catches and holds the 
attention. David's painting of the young revolu- 
tionist, with his wife and infant boy, is reproduced 
in the frontispiece, and four other portraits of 
the man follow in the body of the book. Bibliog- 
raphy and index are added. 

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

Symptomatic of the western world's increasing 
interest in the Japanese stage, as well as in other 
manifestations of Japanese culture, is the appear- 
ance of a collection of condensed epic dramas of 
that island kingdom, edited and translated by 
Professor Asataro Miyamori, revised by Professor 
Stanley Hughes, and furnished with a commen- 
datory foreword by the British Ambassador at 
Tokio. " Tales from Old Japanese Dramas " 
(Putnam) contains eight masterpieces in English 
dress, necessarily much shortened for the play 
in Japan is an all-day performance and wisely 
turned into narrative style, with division into 
chapters instead of acts and scenes. To " the 
Shakespeare of Japan," Chikamatsu Monzayemon, 
is accorded the place of honor, at the end of the 
volume, while seven lesser lights precede him. 
Thirty pages of historical introduction prepare 
the way for the " tales," and a profusion of stage 
scenes and characters is presented in illustrations 
from photographs. The male actor in female 
impersonation is notably present in these pictures, 
as actresses are not yet much more numerous in 
Japan than they were in ancient Greece. The 
English rendering throughout is highly creditable 
to the translator. 

In compendious form and in a style of narra- 
tion suited to its subject, the heroic exploits of 
the Antarctic explorer, Captain Scott, of glorious 
memory, are " retold " by Mr. Charles Turley in 
a well-illustrated volume entitled " The Voyages 
of Captain Scott" (Dodd). As is indicated on 
the title-page, free use has been made of " The 
Voyage of the ' Discovery ' " and " Scott's Last 
Expedition," indispensable authorities to any later 
chronicler of the great adventures to which this 
intrepid explorer and true hero gave the best of 
his energies and, finally, his very life. Sir James 
M. Barrie, from his intimate acquaintance with 
Scott, contributes an introductory sketch of the 
man, showing him to have possessed a nobility of 
character and a heroism in the wear and tear 
of every-day life unsuspected by many a reader of 
his more conspicuous and dramatic achievements. 
Pathetic in the extreme are those last pencilled 
words of Scott's to the world he was leaving, and 
the publishers have done well to insert a facsimile 
reproduction of that page from his diary. A good 
map is added. Four reproductions of water-color 
drawings are among the illustrations.

From the collection of Serbian legends and bal- 
lads compiled by the self-taught Serbian peasant, 
Vouk Stephanovitch-Karadgitch, " the father of 
modern Serbian literature," Mr. Woislav M. 
Petrovitch has selected the specimens of folk-lore 
contained in his stout volume of " Hero Tales and 
Legends of the Serbians" (Stokes). He is at 
present an attache to the Serbian Legation in 
London, and shows an excellent command of our 
language. A former Serbian Minister to England, 
Mr. Chedo Miyatovich, supplies a preface of no 
perfunctory nature; and Mr. William Sewell and 
Mr. Gilbert James enliven the book with colored 
illustrations in apparent harmony with the primi- 
tive legends that they accompany. The inevitable 
and always interesting merging of early pagan in 
later Christian myth and tradition is found here 
as in the folk-lore of other European countries. 
For example : " Our pagan ancestors used to 
sacrifice a pig to their Sun-god, and in our day 
there is not a single house throughout Serbia in 
which ' roast pork ' is not served on Christmas 
Day as a matter of course." Three Serbian bal- 
lads, in Sir John Bowring's version, to which is 
accorded high praise, help to give variety to the 
book, which of course has just now an obvious 
timeliness in addition to its other merits. 

Mrs. T. P. O'Connor does not go so far as to 
say that a long acquaintance with both men and 
dogs has led her to prefer dogs, but she does open 
her book of dog stories which she calls " Dog 
Stars : Three Luminaries in the Dog World " 
(Doran) by quoting Mr. Yeats' s lines on the one 
man who loves " the pilgrim soul " in a woman, 
and adding that " there is more than one woman 
even a beautiful woman who has never found 
the man to love the pilgrim soul in her; and, 
after passionate protestations and broken vows, 
old, disillusioned, sad, and deserted, she has re- 
gained faith in love and fidelity through the devo- 
tion of a dog." The three canine heroes of her 
book are most interesting and lovable creatures, 
and they could not have had a more sympathetic 
biographer. The artist, too, Mr. Will Rannells, 
seems fairly to have been inspired in his excellent 
colored portraits of these intelligent animals. 
Without pretence to greatness as literature, the 
book is one of the very best of its kind. 

Together with the little, amusing, affectionate 
bickerings of intimate domesticity, Mrs. Elisabeth 
Woodbridge Morris (whose pen-name omits the 
last element) gives us, in "More Jonathan Papers" 
(Houghton), some further acceptable chapters of 
outdoor life and outdoor recreation such as made 
her " Jonathan Papers " so breezy and refreshing 
to the reader. In this second volume are depicted 
the joys of amateur maple-sugar-making, the 
pleasures of gardening, the quiet delights of eve- 
nings on the farm, which did not always prove to 
be so quiet as expected, the satisfactions of row- 
ing and fishing, and other kindred matters; and 
through it all it is the engaging manner and per- 
sonality of the chronicler that makes the unpreten- 
tious history so peculiarly enjoyable. Jonathan is 
made to exhibit himself not always to his best 
advantage, but as he thereby contributes no little 



to the general enjoyment he will doubtless forgive 
the mistress of the exhibition. 

The story of the Bible, how it came to be writ- 
ten and something about its subsequent history 
and the part it has played in the progress of the 
world, has an interest that with many readers 
exceeds that of the scriptures themselves. Mr. 
Harold B. Hunting tells once more " The Story 
of Our Bible" (Scribner) and "how it grew to 
be what it is," in a richly illustrated volume of 
nearly three hundred pages. Rather oddly he 
begins with the New Testament, because, as he 
explains, " it is easier to understand the conditions 
in which the New Testament arose, for the very 
reason that they are more like those of modern 
life." His attitude toward modern Bible inter- 
pretation is indicated by his concluding remarks, 
among which he says : " On the other hand, many 
more accepted these new ideas, and suddenly dis- 
covered that to them the value of the Bible had 
been extraordinarily increased. . . They have seen 
that it is no less a divine book for being so thor- 
oughly human." It is this human interest that 
especially appeals to the reader in Mr. Hunting's 
pages. 

Animal stories, told with a sufficiently tight 
curb on the imagination, are likely to be both 
pleasant and profitable reading, provided always 
the narrator knows his subject and has a good 
command of language. These prerequisites are 
not wanting in Mr. John Coulson Tregarthen, who 
also knows his Cornwall and its human types as 
well as the beasts of the field that play the chief 
part in his companion volumes, " The Story of a 
Hare" and "The Life Story of an Otter" 
(Hearst). The camera has been adroitly handled 
to supply pictures of the hare and otter in their 
native haunts, and one of the volumes contains a 
" sketch-map of the scene of the story " from the 
author's own hand a bit of Cornwall to increase 
the verisimilitude of these Cornish animal tales. 
The books are welcome additions to an unfailingly 
popular branch of literature. 

Short stories, little tales or fables, so compressed 
sometimes as to be little more than epigrams, are 
peculiarly popular in Russia, where the long novel 
is no great favorite. Of these bits of sprightly 
fiction Fedor Sologub is a most successful and 
prolific writer, and he has so commended himself 
by his work to Mr. Stephen Graham that the lat- 
ter and his wife have collected, chiefly from Rus- 
sian newspapers, a score and a half (less one) of 
his best pieces and translated them under the title, 
" The Sweet-Scented Name, and Other Fairy 
Tales, Fables, and Stories" (Putnam). Ranging 
from half a page to thirty-three pages in length, 
these selections are very different from our con- 
ception of the short-story masterpiece as written 
by a Poe or a Maupassant or an " 0. Henry," but 
they are all novel and hence of considerable inter- 
est. Mr. Graham's name is a sufficient voucher 
for the faithfulness of the translation. 

"My Growing Garden" (Macmillan) has rather 
unusual individuality. The pleasures of amateur 
horticulture have seldom been so alluringly de- 
picted as by Mr. J. Horace' McFarland in this

chatty and familiar record of his own experience 
on a modest urban, or perhaps we should say 
suburban, estate at Harrisburg, Pa. It is a natu- 
ral growth, this book of his, rather than a product 
of cold calculation. " I have written it," he says, 
"but my family have lived it with me, and the 
print-shop which bears my name and enjoys my 
garden has made of the book much more than a 
perfunctory item of work. The publishers, too, 
have let down the bars, so that in a very special 
sense the book has been lived, written, designed, 
illustrated, printed, and bound as the work of one 
man and those about him." Many pictures, four 
in color and thirty-two in sepia, accompany the 
reading matter. 

Mr. FitzRoy Carrington, who has several times 
acquitted himself with credit in similar tasks of 
poetic taste and selection, compiles this year a 
small anthology which he calls " The Quiet Hour " 
(Houghton), embracing choice bits of verse from 
English poets of the sixteenth and following cen- 
turies. These selections are grouped under the 
headings, Cradle Songs, Infancy, Childhood, Night, 
Sleep, Charms, and Dirges. An apt and graceful 
dedicatory sonnet to his wife proves the compiler 
to be a poet as well as a lover of poets. Eight 
portraits are scattered through the book, which in 
every aspect is a tasteful little production. 

This year's pictorial re-interpretation of "A 
Christmas Carol " comes from the skilful hand of 
Mr. Arthur Rackham. Twelve colored and eight- 
een uncolored drawings enliven the immortal tale. 
Master of the whimsical and grotesque, of the 
humorous, and of that which makes a direct 
appeal to the human nature in us all, the artist 
has done his work well; and printer and binder 
have seconded his efforts. The book is brought 
out in this country by the J. B. Lippincott Co. 

Sound doctrine, expressed in homely terms, with 
a jingle to them, will be found in Mr. Walt 
Mason's "Horse Sense" (McClurg), an enter- 
taining collection of his popular pieces of rhymed 
prose. The whimsical regret that "there'll never 
be such days as those when people wore no under- 
clothes" recalls, by its faulty rhyme, the Words- 
worth couplet introducing the Blind Highland 
Boy's nautical adventures on Loch Leven in " a 
household Tub, like one of those which women use 
to wash their clothes." But it should be added 
that the poet, "in deference to the opinion of a 
Friend," afterward substituted a turtle-shell for 
the tub. To have reminded one of Wordsworth is 
no despicable achievement. The frontispiece shows 
" the author as ' Zim ' sees him." 

Mr. Ralph Henry Barbour's annual contribu- 
tion to the season's fiction is this year entitled 
" Heart's Content " (Lippincott) , being, as the 
name indicates, a love story with a happy ending 
altogether a cheery little romance for Christ- 
mas or any other festive day. The hero, Allan 
Shortland, asks the heroine, Beryl Vernon, whom 
he has resolved to win, for congratulations on his 
approaching marriage before securing her con- 
sent to play a leading part in that ceremony. Of 
bright dialogue and clever invention there is no 
lack. Colored pictures and marginal sketches of 



a decorative character abound. It should be added 
that the story is not unknown to magazine-readers 
under the title, " The Happy Man," but that fact 
is rather in its favor than otherwise. 

Advocates of woman suffrage, just now perhaps 
a little down-hearted from their recent setback at 
the polls, will find in Mr. Orison Swett Marden's 
"Woman and Home" (Crowell) a source of con- 
solation and encouragement. He is an enthusiastic 
admirer of the " new woman " and a vigorous 
defender of her rights. His chapters discuss 
woman's opportunities and responsibilities, her 
education, her home, woman as voter and as wife, 
the divorce question, and many other topics of 
interest to women, and indeed to readers of both 
sexes. " Woman has never taken a step forward," 
he believes, " that has not benefited the whole 
human race. Everything she has touched she has 
improved, elevated, purified." This latest product 
of the writer's pen is likely to be hailed by many 
readers as one of his best utterances. 

Mrs. Florence Hobart Perin regrets that " fam- 
ily devotions have largely gone out of fashion," 
but derives some consolation from the thought that 
" f amilies do still come together at the breakfast 
table whether they live in country, village, or city," 
and believes that " a pause of three minutes 
before starting the work of the day will give the 
spiritual uplift which will enable us to do better 
work and fight a braver battle" provided this 
pause be put to the right use. " Sunlit Days," a 
collection of passages of verse and of prayer 
selected by her, furnishes the material for thus 
wisely filling the three minutes each morning. A 
page is given to every day in the year, and the 
writers quoted range from the famous to the 
obscure. Good taste is shown by the compiler, 
whose two previous similar works have, she an- 
nounces in her preface, begotten a widespread 
desire for a third. (Little, Brown & Co.) 

"The Shadow on the Dial" (Abingdon Press), 
by Mr. Orton H. Carmichael, is a book of mystical 
musings if one may attempt a brief characteri- 
zation of it strung together on the thread of 
Vera Meldrum's life and death and personality. 
Devotion and nature-study and philosophy and 
poetry mingle throughout the successive chapters, 
while some notably clean-cut and beautiful half- 
tones from the great book of nature, as spread 
open at " Elmwood " in western New York, help 
in no small measure to emphasize the meaning of 
the reading matter. 

A new and enlarged edition of Mr. J. Walker 
McSpadden's "Opera Synopses" (Crowell) makes 
its appearance. Since its first issue, four years 
ago, there have been presented in this country a 
sufficient number of new operas and revivals of 
old ones to justify this extended reissue, which 
includes twenty-four operas not found in the ear- 
lier work, and among them the ten-thousand-dollar 
prize production brought out at the Metropolitan 
Opera House in 1911-12. Thus, although of about 
the same size and general plan as the familiar 
work by Mr. George P. Upton in the same field, 
this later handbook has the advantage of being 
more nearly up to date.

NOTES. 



" Columbine " is the title of an immediately 
forthcoming novel by Miss Viola Meynell. 

It is reported that the Nobel Prize for litera- 
ture, for 1914, has been awarded to M. Romain 
Holland, the author of " Jean Christophe." 

A new novel by Miss Marguerite Bryant, author 
of " Christopher Hibbault : Roadmaker," is an- 
nounced by Messrs. Duffield. Its title is " Felicity 
Crofton." 

Lovers of Tacitus will be glad to hear of a new 
English translation of the Histories, made by Dr. 
George Gilbery Ramsay, which Messrs. Dutton are 
about to issue. 

Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer has prepared an an- 
swer to Mr. Bernard Shaw's views about the war, 
which Messrs. Doran will issue at once under the 
title of " Between St. Dennis and St. George." 

A volume of " War Letters of an American 
Woman," by Miss Marie Van Vorst, who has been 
in Paris with the American Ambulance, and else- 
where on the Western front, is soon to appear. 

" Lodges in the Wilderness," by Mr. W. C. 
Scully, which is announced for winter publication 
by Messrs. Holt, is a record of impressions and 
reminiscences by one who was for several years a 
British Rural Magistrate in South Africa. 

A biography of Dostoieffsky, by Eugenii Solo- 
viev, is being translated into English and will be 
published shortly. In this study the author has 
aimed to correct some popular misconceptions of 
Dostoieffsky, and to supply a balanced view of 
his life and influence. 

Among the new volumes announced for publica- 
tion by Messrs. Longmans before the end of the 
present month are : " The Capture of De Wet : 
The South African Rebellion, 1914," by Mr. Philip 
J. Sampson; " Cuba Old and New," by Mr. A. G. 
Robinson ; and "An American Garland : Being a 
Collection of Ballads Relating to America, 1563- 
1759," edited, with Introduction and notes, by 
Professor C. H. Firth. 

An illustrated monograph entitled " Rudyard 
Kipling: A Literary Appreciation," by Mr. R. 
Thurston Hopkins, who gives an anecdotal history 
of his hero's career as well as a critical review of 
his works, will be published at once by Messrs. 
Simpkin, Marshall & Co. of London. A bibliog- 
raphy of criticisms and reviews is also included, 
as well as parodies and a list of various portraits, 
drawings, and caricatures. 

Five new volumes in the " Oxford Garlands," 
edited by Mr. R. M. Leonard, making fifteen in 
all, are about to be published by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press. Their subjects are " Elegies and 
Epitaphs," " Songs for Music," " Poems on Ani- 
mals," " Modern Lays and Ballads," and " Epi- 
grams." The Press will also publish before long 
an anthology of Buddhist verse entitled " The 
Heart of Buddhism," translated and edited by 
Mr. K. T. Saunders; "A Book of Sorrow: An 
Anthology of Poems," compiled by Mr. Andrew 
Macphail ; " This England," an anthology of En- 
glish character and landscape, compiled by Mr.

Edward Thomas ; " English Prose : Narrative, 
Descriptive, and Dramatic," compiled by Mr. H. A. 
Treble; and "English Critical Essays (Nineteenth 
Century)," selected and edited by Mr. Edmund D. 
Jones, the last two volumes being additions to the 
" World's Classics." 

The " Covent Garden Journal," which Henry 
Fielding, late in life, edited for about a year 
the last of the periodicals to be edited by the 
novelist has been ransacked for a volume under 
that title which is to be published by the Yale 
University Press. The volume, which is edited by 
Dr. Gerard E. Jensen, with notes and an Intro- 
duction dealing with Fielding's varied activities, 
contains a reprint of all the leading articles 
seventy-two in number and other contributions 
clearly from Fielding's own pen. 

Supplementing Mr. Rudyard Kipling's just- 
published " France at War," which includes his 
memorable poem, " France," there were to have 
come, it is said on good authority, further sketches 
from the front, which the author was preparing to 
visit again with special arrangements for seeing 
and recording things noteworthy in the war area. 
But this half -promised, half -projected book seems 
now, unfortunately, not likely to be forthcoming, 
as word has been received that Mr. Kipling's son 
is reported " missing " and it is feared that he has 
been killed in action; 

Dr. Walter Leaf's new work, on " Homer and 
History," which Messrs. Macmillan hope to have 
ready next month, is based in part on an undeliv- 
ered course of 'lectures on the Norman Wait Harris 
foundation prepared by the author on the invita- 
tion of Northwestern University, Evanston, Illi- 
nois. Everything was arranged for Dr. Leaf's 
journey to the United States when the outbreak of 
war and imperative duties of another kind left 
him no alternative but to cancel the engagements. 
The Lecture Committee, however, has given its 
permission for the publication of the book as one 
of the series. 

The National Council of the Independent Labour 
Party will be responsible for an official biography 
of the late Mr. Keir Hardie. Some time since, 
Mr. Hardie deposited at the head office of the 
party a mass of his private correspondence and 
other papers; but, in order that the biography 
should be as complete as possible, an appeal is 
made for the loan of letters or other documents, 
which should be sent to the General Secretary of 
the I. L. P., St. Bride's House, Salisbury-square, 
London, E.G. Care will be taken of all papers 
sent, and they will be returned to the sender if 
desired. Reminiscences or accounts and impres- 
sions of personal contact with Mr. Hardie would 
also be much appreciated. 

Having completed his epic of Dartmoor in some 
twenty-five volumes, Mr. Eden Phillpotts is con- 
templating a similar series of romances to be 
written round such English national industries as 
seem to lend themselves to the scheme. This is an 
old idea of Mr. Phillpotts's, begun long ago with 
his early stories of the Cornish fisheries, but 
brushed aside by the Dartmoor series. It was 
revived by " Brunei's Tower," the author's recent 



story of the Devonshire potteries, and is continued 
by "Old Delabole," a tale of the Cornish slate 
quarries, which has just appeared. This will be 
followed in due course by " Song o' the Hops," 
which has just been completed in manuscript. 
Mr. Eden Phillpotts is also collecting in a volume 
his series on " The Human Boy and the War," 
many of which have appeared serially. 

Professor Frederick Starr, of the University of 
Chicago, has recently left for a six-months' expedi- 
tion to Japan and Korea, where he plans to finish 
studies already begun, leaving himself free for 
proposed labors in Siam and Cambodia. In 
Japan, particular attention will be given to photo- 
graphic work, the effort being made to finish out 
his already large series of negatives illustrating 
the life and culture of the Island Empire; he will 
continue his study of Buddhist sects and will visit 
the more important Shinto shrines, so far as he 
has not seen them; he hopes also to complete his 
investigation of Japanese symbolism, upon which 
he has been engaged for several years. In Korea 
he plans pilgrimages to the more famous old 
Buddhist monasteries, which abound in interesting 
and almost unknown works of art; he hopes also 
to gather much material for a " Manual of Korean 
Ethnography " and to make the beginnings of an 
ethnographic collection along lines which he has 
long had in mind; he will continue his collections 
of Korean riddles and proverbs, already of con- 
siderable extent; finally, he desires to study fur- 
ther the administrative work of the Japanese in 
Korea, a work which he has watched with interest 
ever since Japan began to exercise preponderant 
influence in that land. 

The following note regarding the late Sir James 
Murray appears in the latest section of the Oxford 
Dictionary : " Sir James Murray died on the 
26th July, 1915. His great wish that he should 
live to finish the Dictionary on his eightieth birth- 
day, in 1917, has not been fulfilled ; the unceasing 
labour of three and thirty years has ended when 
less than a tenth part of the work remains to be 
done. Almost within a week of his death he was 
still hard at work, showing, as Dr. Bradley wrote 
of a visit made to him, ' not a little of the zest and 
mental lucidity that I remembered of old.' In the 
preceding months, while barely convalescent from 
an illness that seemed to bring him to the gates of 
death, he had prepared, and at the appointed date 
of July 1 published, his usual ' double section.' 
' The words contained in it/ Dr. Bradley says, 
' present an extraordinary number of difficult 
problems, which are handled with the editor's char- 
acteristic sagacity and resource; the section is a 
piece of his work of which he might be proud.' It 
has always been the rule that each of the editors 
should be exclusively responsible for the portions 
of the Dictionary issued under his name. The 
sections in the hands of Dr. Bradley, Dr. Craigie, 
Mr. Onions, and their staffs, will not be affected. 
But Sir James Murray at the beginning laid the 
lines and drew the plan ; in the prosecution of the 
work, when it became clear that it must be shared, 
his amazing capacity for unremitting labour ena- 
bled him to take more than an equal part, and the

volumes produced by himself show characteristic 
excellences which cannot be exactly matched, 
though they may be rivalled by merits of another 
kind. He will not write the last pages, but more 
than that of any other man his name will be asso- 
ciated with the long and efficient working of the 
great engine of research by which the Dictionary 
has been produced." 

The leader of his race in America, in all that 
makes for a better, richer, nobler, and more useful 
life, has passed away and left no one to take his 
place. So it seems, at any rate, in viewing the 
vacancy left by the death of Booker T. Washing- 
ton, educator of colored youth, uplifter of his 
fellow-negroes, writer of notable books on his own 
chosen work and on the peculiar problems that he 
has wrestled with in his labors of five and thirty 
years, public speaker of eloquence and force, and 
loyal citizen of the country from which his people 
can hardly feel that they have received nothing 
but benefactions. fourteen years of scantily 
rewarded toil at Tuskegee preceded any general 
recognition of his rare quality as an educator. It 
was by his address at the opening of the Cotton 
States Exposition at Atlanta, in 1895, that he first 
attracted public attention. Since then his life has 
been a part of the history of the South, or at least 
of the colored race in the South. Our especial 
concern with his achievements must here be limited 
to his books, of which, in the midst of crowding 
duties and engagements, he somehow found time 
to write eleven, " Sowing and Reaping," " Up 
from Slavery," " The Future of the American 
Negro," "Character Building," "The Story of 
My Life and Work," "Working with Hands," 
" Tuskegee and its People," " Putting the Most 
into Life," "Life of Frederick Douglass," "The 
Negro in Business," and " The Story of the 
Negro." In his autobiographic writings he was, 
naturally enough, at his best; but in all that he 
wrote there is directness and force that belong 
only to records based on personal experience. His 
published works form a worthy monument to his 
memory.

Irving Manuscript Wanted 

THE GROLIER CLUB, 29 E. 32d Street, New York 
City, is about to publish from the original manuscript, a 
Journal of Washington Irving, covering the period of 
his first visit to Europe, 1804-1805. A small portion of the 
manuscript, written during April and May, 1805, is missing, 
and the club would appreciate any information regarding 
its whereabouts. The journal was written in small, vellum- 
bound notebooks, and it is probable that the lacking portion 
is labeled "Vol. 3d."

The^ale Review 

The New American Quarterly 

is not a Yale University review. It is an Ameri- 
can review. More even than an American review, 
it is a cosmopolitan review, and that of the high- 
est order 

Its articles on foreign affairs and American politics, 
the literary essays, the brilliant discussions of the 
theatre, peace and war, feminism and the press, 
have already won attention both in this country 
and abroad.

the late John Bigelow, was Minister to France. Through 
the father's friends among Berlin Court officials, young 
Bigelow had the opportunity of associating as play- 
fellow with the present Emperor. Mr. Bigelow's nar- 
rative is dramatic, spirited, humorous, and shows a full 
knowledge ; and, though with an unusual freedom from 
prejudice, he warns America that Germany contemplates 
forcible intervention in the Western World. 

Secret Diplomatic

The veteran Japanese diplomat traces some of the 
great consummations of recent Japanese diplomacy. 
The author, as the Ambassador from the Mikado's 
Empire to the Court of St. James, had a large measure

the last. It will prove a splendid library or 
reference book for newspapers, authors, and 
readers of history." Atlanta Constitution. 

The author records what he can remember 
of the people with whom he has had personal 
relations on both sides of the Atlantic during 
the fifty years since 1865, and he gives also 
his own views in regard to certain questions 
of the day in which, as a citizen, he has taken 
his part, such as Free Trade, Honest Money, 
Civil Service Reform, Copyright Interna- 
tional and Domestic, and matters connected 
with municipal, state, and national politics.

the events of the author's distinguished career 
on the field are traced with the help of a diary 
which he had kept, an important part of the

experiences, and observations of the Provost- 
Marshal of Washington, an office which the 
author filled during 1862-3. The author 
likewise had the distinction of being one of 
the lawyers for the defense in the famous

The Modern Study of Literature. By Richard Green Moulton, Head of the Depart- 
ment of General Literature in the University of Chicago. 

An introduction to literary theory and interpretation by the Head of the Department of General 
Literature in the University of Chicago. The purpose of this work is to discuss the Study of Literature: 
what it must become if it is to maintain its place in the foremost ranks of modern studies. The author's 
previous well-known books on literary criticism and his long and successful experience in the public 
presentation of literature have especially fitted him for the authoritative discussion of this great problem 
of modern education. 

The Nation. Professor Richard Green Moul ton's "The Modern Study of Literature " is the culmination 
of over forty years wholly occupied in the teaching of literature and in preparing various books 
which the author now regards as preliminary studies discussions of particular principles in 
application to special literary fields .... His enthusiasm for literature, his intimate acquaintance 
with it in classical, Hebraic, and modern English forms, .... the mingled precision and fluency of 
his style these characteristics are familiar to readers of even one or two of his preceding books. 
vi+542 pages, I2mo, cloth; $2.50, postage extra (weight i Ib. 13 oz.). 

London in English Literature. By Percy Holmes Boynton, Associate Professor of 

English Literature in the University of Chicago. 

This volume differs from all other volumes on London in that it gives a consecutive illustrated 
account of London, not from the point of view of the antiquarian, but from that of the inquiring student 
of English literary history. It deals with ten consecutive periods, characterized in turn by the work and 
spirit of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Addison, Johnson, Lamb, Dickens, and by the qualities 
of Victorian and contemporary London. The temper of each epoch is discussed, and then in particular 
those literary works which are intimately related to certain localities in London. The work contains 
four maps and forty-three other illustrations, selected from the best of a great fund of material. 
Harvard Graduates' Magazine. Whoever looks into "London in English Literature" by Percy H. 

Boynton, will be likely not to dismiss it until he has read it through The numerous 

illustrations, reproduced from old prints, deserve especial notice. Persons going to London 
will do well to take this volume with them. 

xii+346 pages, 8vo, cloth; $2.00, postage extra (weight 2 Ibs. 2 oz.). 

A Short History of Japan. By Ernest Wilson Clement. 

Because of the intense interest in the present political situation in the Far East this short history 
of Japan will make a strong appeal to readers and travelers who are asking for a better knowledge of 
the background of the struggle for supremacy in the Orient. 

The author, Ernest Wilson Clement, whose long residence in Japan as a teacher, interpreter for 
the United States legation, correspondent, and editor has given him a wide familiarity with the country, 
has written a brief but discriminating account of both Old and New Japan; and for the many readers 
who do not care to go into the details of Japanese history the book will be found a highly interesting epitome 
of what has happened during the long course of Japanese development. As frequent references are 
made to fuller accounts, the book may well serve as an introduction to further study of the country and 
its institutions. 

The Japan Gazette. This small volume is just the book that a traveler or one desiring the facts of Japan's 
history in the shortest compass and in readable form will be especially grateful for. And yet, 
notwithstanding its brevity, it in no sense partakes of the guide-book style of composition,

Chicago and the Old Northwest. 1673-1835. By Milo Milton Quaife, Superinten- 
dent of the Wisconsin State Historical Society. 

This book recounts, in a manner at once scholarly and dramatic, the early history of Chicago. 
Important as this subject is, it is not treated solely for its own sake. The author's larger purpose 
has been to trace the evolution of the frontier from savagery to civilization. From the point of view 
of Chicago and the Northwest alone the work is local in character, although the locality concerned 
embraces five great states of the Union; in the larger sense its interest is as broad as America, for every 
foot of America has been at some time on the frontier of civilization. It is believed that this book will 
take rank as the standard history of Chicago in the early days. 

The Independent. At last we have an adequate history of the beginnings of Chicago. It is certainly a 
remarkable circumstance that not until the lapse of one hundred and ten years after Captain 
John Whistler erected Fort Dearborn on the west bank of Lake Michigan should a trustworthy 
history appear of that wonderful western city of which he was the founder.

TRUE GHOST STORIES 

By HEREWARD CARRINGTON 

In this book the author presents a number of startling cases which he has dis- 
covered in his unrivalled investigations of psychical mysteries. They are not the 
ordinary "ghost stories," based on pure fiction and having no foundation in reality, 
but are a collection of incidents all thoroughly investigated and vouched for, the 
testimony being obtained first hand and corroborated by others. 

The first chapter deals with the interesting question What Is a Ghost? and at- 
tempts to answer this question in the light of the latest scientific theories which have 
been advanced to explain these supernatural happenings and visitants. 

Other chapters are: Phantasms of the Dead; More Phantasms; Haunted Houses; 
Ghost Stories of a More Dramatic Order; Historical Ghosts; The Phantom A rmies Seen in France; Bibliography.

A New Volume by James Whitcomb Riley 

In the Famous Illustrated Deer Creek Edition 

RILEY SONGS OF FRIENDSHIP 

In answer to an insistent demand, a new volume has been added to the immensely popular Deer Creek 
collection of Riley verse, containing the poems devoted to the celebration of friendship. Old times, old 
friends how James Whitcomb Riley loves them and loves to sing of them ! When he comes back to them 
after other, perhaps more ambitious flights, we feel he is striking his truest note. Half a hundred poems 
here including a number of old favorites voice in homely fashion the poet's greetings, and glorify the 
ties that everywhere bind kindly human hearts together. Young at heart, we enter here with Riley into the 
happy kingdom of the days that were. Hoosier Pictures by WILL VAWTER. Cloth, $1.25. Leather, $2.00

An Official Notice 

'T V HE new llth edition of The Encyclopaedia 
A Britannica after this date will be sold in two 
forms : 

1. The "Cambridge University" issue the work as at present published 
by the Cambridge University Press, England, and sold in America by 
The Encyclopaedia Britannica Corporation; a large-page book, printed 
from large type and with wide margins; in general, the form that it 
has appeared in since 1768 when the first edition was published. 

2. The "Handy Volume" issue, designed for a wider public, at a popular 
price; an entirely new form, more economically manufactured, printed 
from new plates, with smaller page, smaller margins and smaller type. 
It will be sold exclusively by Sears, Roebuck and Co., Chicago. 

The text, illustrations, maps, in short, the entire contents 
are exactly the same in both issues. Both will be printed on 
Britannica India Paper. 



The Encyclopaedia Britannica, nth

one years before the inauguration 
of Washington as President, it has 
again and again been re-written 
and re-issued in enlarged and im- 
proved form. Each edition has 
been more successful than its 
predecessor. The new Eleventh 
Edition of the Britannica is the 
culmination of a century and a 
half of constant progress. How 
useful The Encyclopaedia Britan- 
nica is now and has been for six 
generations is proved by the fact 
that more copies of it have been 
sold than all other encyclopaedias 
combined.

By CHARLES S. BROOKS. Illustrated 
with thirty woodcuts by ALLEN 
LEWIS. 

These Essays possess at once rare 
bookish flavor, keen if whimsical in- 
sight, and a happy pictorial power. 

The author possesses the unusual 
gift of being able to write charm- 
ingly on simple subjects, finding his 
appeal in the happy turn he is able 
to give to homely things. The 
book is illustrated from wood blocks 
cut by Allen Lewis, who has been 
markedly successful in reproducing 
the spirit of the Essays.

Civilization and 
Climate 

By ELLSWORTH HUNTINGTON, Ph. D., 
author of "The Pulse of Asia." 

Mr. Huntington has mapped the 
civilization of the world and has 
mapped its climate. He shows not 
only that the most advanced people 
are those living in the most changeable 
and therefore the most stimulating 
climate, but applying his discoveries 
to history, he shows that the nations 
which advanced and then fell back, 
such as the Peruvians, the Greeks, and 
the nations of Palestine, enjoyed a 
climate at the time of their preeminence 
which they no longer have.

A Voice From 
the Crowd 

By GEORGE WHARTON PEPPER. 

This volume contains the first Lyman 
Beecher Lectures to be delivered by a 
layman. Mr. Edwin C. Dargan says of 
it in the Homiletic Review. 

"The work reveals a strong and 
highly cultured mind, clear and solid 
thinking, facility and charm of ex- 
pression, and a winsome and brotherly 
spirit. The occasional direct or im- 
plied criticism of preachers is ever 
kindly, never trenchant, and invariably 
just .... The counsels given are emi- 
nently wise and true, pointed by 
common sense and weighted by keen 
observation and careful thought."

Some Christian 
Convictions 

EV. HENRY SLOANE COFFIN, 



Bishop Burnett, in his History of His 
Own Time, writes of Sir Harry Vane, 
that he belonged "to the sect called 
'Seekers,' as being satisfied with no 
form of opinion yet extant, but waiting 
for future discoveries." It is for 
"seekers" that the author has restated 
a few essential Christian convictions 
in terms that are intelligible and per- 
suasive to persons who have felt the 
force of the various intellectual move- 
ments of recent years.

A NEW SERIES OF BOOKS ON POPULAR PHILOSOPHY 

By GEORGE TRUMBULL LADD, LL.D., Emeritus Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics, Yale University. 

Each Volume, Crown 8vo. $1.50 net. 

WHAT CAN I KNOW ? An Inquiry into Truth, Its Nature, the Means of its Attainment, and its Rela- 
tions to the Practical Life. 
WHAT OUGHT I TO DO ? An Inquiry into the Nature and Kinds of Virtue and into the Sanctions, 

Aims and Values of the Moral Life. 

WHAT SHOULD I BELIEVE ? An Inquiry Into the Nature, Grounds and Value of the Faiths of Sci- 
ence, Society, Morals and Religion. 

WHAT MAY I HOPE ? An Inquiry into the Sources and Reasonableness of the Hopes of Humanity, 
Especially the Social and Religious. 

"The Yale professor's series of books on knowledge, ethics and belief . . . is a work of which Americans may be 
justly proud. Nothing could be more blessedly remote from the dry and unprofitable profundity of modern Teuton philosophy 
than these common sense formulations of the questions that occur and recur to every man's mind, these travelling directions 
for the pilgrim between two darknesses. . . . Prof. Ladd handles sensible questions in a sensible way, and sensible 
people will thank him for giving them a ^af when they ask for bread, instead of the Belgian block with which so many philoso- 
phers fool themselves and try to fool plain John Smith. . ~" v ~*- c "~ 



CONDUCT AND THE SUPERNATURAL 

By LIONEL SPENCER THORNTON, M.A., of the Com- 
munity of the Resurrection, Mirfield. 8vo. $2.25 net. 
The writer has had a double purpose before him through- 
out: first, to examine and criticize certain ethical systems 
which illustrate the modern reaction against Christian ideals, 
and, secondly, to offer in apologetic form an argument for the 
supremacy of the Christian ethic. 

PRINCIPLES OF GENERAL PHYSI- 
OLOGY 

By WILLIAM MADDOCK BAYLISS, M.A., D.Sc., 
F.R.S., etc. Professor of General Physiology in Uni- 
versity College, London. With 259 Illustrations, Royal 
8vo. $6.00 net. 

The book treats of the fundamental properties of animal 
and vegetable cells and organisms, somewhat on the lines of 
the "Ph<nom6nes de la Vie," of Cl. Bernard. Special atten- 
tion is given to phenomena whose laws are n9t usually to be 
found in similar books, such as those of reactions in colloidal 
systems, oxidation, action on surfaces, as well as to secretion, 
excitation, inhibition, nutrition and other more strictly 
"vital " processes. A book of wide interest. 

CUBA, OLD AND NEW 

By A. G. ROBINSON, Author of "Cuba and the Interven- 
tion," etc. With numerous Illustrations from Original 
Photographs. Small 8vo. Cloth, ornamental. $1.75 net. 
The author's chief purpose in the preparation of this vol- 
ume was a presentation of the main points in Cuba's history, 
a fair knowledge of which is absolutely necessary in any 
proper understanding of the relations of the United States to 
the Island of Cuba and of the conditions existing to-day. He 
writes from nearly twenty years of special study of, and con- 
tact with, the affairs of the island; from many visits to it; 
and from personal acquaintance with many of those who have 
been prominent in Cuba's experiences since the American 
occupation in January, 1899. 

THE LIGHT WITHIN. A Study of the 
Holy Spirit. 

By CHARLES LEWIS SLATTERY, D.D., Rector of Grace 

Church in New York. $2.00 net. 

In this book Dr. Slattery describes the growth of the human 
understanding of the Holy Spirit, first through Old Testament 
times, then through the first century, with special emphasis 
upon Christ's teachings, the Day of Pentecost, St. Paul's 
Epistles and the point of view of the Fourth Gospel. Inci- 
dentally this study bears traces of the great European War, 
which had begun before the book was published and_ which 
demanded of the writer a searching justification of his faith 
in an immanent and unfaltering Divine Leadership. 

THE CROWD IN PEACE AND WAR 

By SIR MARTIN CONWAY, late Roscoe Professor of Art, 

Liverpool; Slade Professor of Art, Cambridge; President 

of the Alpine Club. Crown 8vo. Pp. 340. #7.75 net. 

This is an attempt to deal in popular language with the 

relations of the individual to the crowd, and of crowds to 

one another. The writer discusses the broad questions of 

morality, religion, government, socialism, war, education, 

etc., from a novel point of view, and illustrates his remarks 

by numerous tales and citations from authors ancient and 

modern.

By E. CE. SOMERVILLE and MARTIN ROSS, Authors of

Mr. Knqx's Country is that district of South-Western 
Ireland which was hunted by the hounds of which Flurry 
Knox was the M.F.H. Some new friends will be met with in 
that cheerful country, and many old ones, amongst them the 
Narrator, Major Sinclair Yeates, R.M., and Mr. and Mrs.

At the request of many friends. Dr. M'Taggart has re- 
printed the interesting chapters on Human Immortality and 
Pre-Existence from his well-known work "Some Dogmas of 
Religion," in order to bring them within the reach of those 
readers who found the expense of the larger book a bar to its 
purchase. The author is recognized as one of the most dis- 
tinguished exponents of Philosophy in the present day, and 
the subject of this little volume is of such vital importance 
that his carefully thought-out propositions can not fail to 
be of great interest. 

A SURGEON IN KHAKI 

By ARTHUR ANDERSON MARTIN, M.D., etc. With 
25 Illustrations. 8vo. Pp. x+2?9. $3.00 net. 
Dr. Martin was attached to one of the Field Ambulances, 
and did his share of its work at the battles on the Marne and 
the Aisne, and afterwards in Flanders. 

Although it is written by a surgeon, and contains one or 
two chapters on the professional side of the campaign, this 
book is essentially for the general reader. It is written in a 
fresh, free style, and as the author does not scorn to give the 
small details of how he fared from day to day, the reader gets 
a more vivid idea of the events as they struck the individual 
on the spot than has hitherto been given. 

BLACK AND WHITE IN THE SOUTHERN

By MAURICE S. EVANS, C.M.G., Author of "Black 
and White in South-East Africa." With Map and Index. 
8vo. Pp. xii + 299. 2.25 net. 

"The keen intellect and tender conscience of the Twentieth 
Century both imperatively demand that the illogical and 
unethical attitude in which the races face each other in the 
Southern States and in South Africa shall be changed for 
one that we can justify, and with which the black man shall 
be satisfied. Our question is one phase of the greater prob- 
lem of race and color which touches all the European nations, 
and nearly every backward race and tribe throughout the 
wide world. The problem of the Twentieth Century is the 
problem of the color line." From the Author's Introduc- 
tion."

SAFETY FIRST 

A Book-Disinfecting Machine 

Something New for Libraries, Schools, etc. 

Wm. H. Rademaekers, the well-known Library 
Binder of Newark, N. J., has for many years 
noted that libraries and schools need to safe- 
guard employees, pupils and borrowers of books. 

He has invented and patented a book-disin- 
fecting machine, which enables him to disinfect 
without the slightest injury every page of a 
book after it is rebound. 

BOOKS CARRY DISEASE GERMS 

Libraries and schools can now have their 
books rebound, and at the same time disinfected, 
without extra cost. 

Thirty years of experience in all branches of 
bookbinding have taught me what binding is most 
suitable for hard use in libraries and schools. 

I supervise all my work. My bindery is 
always open for visitors. 

Send me two works of fiction prepaid and I 
will rebind same, one in Lib. Buckram and one 
in Half Leather, and send them to you that you 
may see samples of our work. 

I return all work four weeks after receiving it. 
Ask for price list. Give us a trial.

confidences. 

Private correspondence of great thinkers, artists,

THE GREAT BIG

By 

Jeffery Farnol 



TheN.Y.Even-

There are 572 pages

not a dull one 
among them. It 
more than fulfils 
the expectations 
aroused by "The 
Broad Highway." 



BELTANE THE SMITH 

A ROMANCE OF THE GREENWOOD 

$1.50 Net. 



The greatest literary achievement for years, 
a book that is bound to last and grow in popular- 
ity with the years. It is a romance of love and 
adventure that for charm and beauty rivals in 
its allurement Tennyson's "Idylls of the King." 
Boston Globe. 

More strongly than any other literary figure 
does Mr. Farnol's latest hero suggest Don Quix- 
ote's own heart. We follow Beltane from one 
exploit to another with a constantly increasing 
curiosity. The romance as a whole is illusive 
and it betrays a vigorous and resourceful im- 
agination. Boston Transcript. 

The author of "The Broad Highway" long 
ago proved the magic of his pen, and the many 
who have enjoyed his previous tales will find 
570 pages of fresh allure and enjoyment in this 
new story of derring-do and the greenwood and 
high emprise and romantic love. New York 
Times. 



Mr. Farnol has brought to the development 
of this theme the same study of the epoch dealt 
with as he did in "The Broad Highway." It 
reminded one of Gil Bias; this, in some ways, 
reminds one of Don Quixote though Beltane 
is as sane as a young Lohengrin. . It is a fine 
example of Mr. Farnol's thoughtful work, 
written in his happiest style. Philadelphia Pub- 
lic Ledger.

1915] THE DIAL 543 



II 



The Literary "Find" of the Year 

What It Is: 

"Lafcadio Hearn sat himself down before a company of keen, alert young Japa- 
nese how keen and alert nobody can fully understand who has not himself met such 
a company in a university lecture room and talked to them right out of his head, 
just as the fancy moved him. He had no text-book before him, and no notes. He 
just talked, in a simple, direct, intimate, colloquial fashion, about the authors and 
books that thronged the chambers and shelves of his own compendious mind. He 
talked discursively, after the style of a peripatetic philosopher, yet always coherently 
and logically. He talked slowly, too; partly because he had to think out what he was 
to say as he went along, and partly because he was speaking in a language somewhat 
unfamiliar to his hearers, and he wanted them to comprehend his words. So de- 
liberately did he talk, indeed, that some of his hearers were able with nimble hands 
to write down verbatim what he said, and it is from these reports of his lectures, thus 
prepared, that these volumes ("Interpretations of Literature," by Lafcadio Hearn) 
have been compiled. There are in them, consequently, a spontaneity and a sympa- 
thetic charm which must have been compelling and convincing to his Japanese hearers, 
and which will prove no less triumphant among his American readers." New York 
Herald. 

What Critics Say:^- 

"The supreme value of the work for present consideration is the efficiency of its interpretations 
of English literature to English readers, who perhaps are as much in need of such service as were 
Hearn's pupils at the Imperial University of Japan." New York Herald. 

' ' For these remarkable documents there is probably no equivalent in any language. . . . Delivered 
in a Western tongue to Oriental hearers, one expected a certain simplicity of utterance, and yet no 
one could have anticipated such an amazing flow of elementary terms, perfect in their expression of 
the most complex thoughts." San Francisco Chronicle. 

"A body of the finest kind of criticism, so far as substance is concerned, almost meriting Professor 
Erskine's sweeping claim that it is 'unmatched in English unless we return to Coleridge, and in 
some ways unequaled by anything in Coleridge'." N. Y. Times. 

"In publishing the lectures which Lafcadio Hearn delivered at Tokio University from 1896 to 
1902, a service has been done not only to literature, but to friendship among the nations." N. Y. 
Evening Post.

WILLIAM MORRIS AND THE WORLD 
TO-DAY. 

" I have not been well, and there have been 
other troubles of which I won't speak, and the 
sum of all has rather made me break down. I 
hope I am not quite unhumble, or want to be the 
only person in the world untroubled; but I have 
been ever loth to think that there were no people 
going through life, not without pain indeed, but 
with simplicity and free from blinding entangle- 
ments. Such an one I want to be, and my faith 
is that it is possible for most men to be no worse. 
Yet indeed I am older, and the year is evil; the 
summerless season, and famine and war, and the 
folly of peoples come back again, as it were, and 
the more and more obvious death of art before 
it rises again, are heavy matters to a small crea- 
ture like me, who cannot choose but think about 
them, and can mend them scarce a whit." 

Thus wrote William Morris to Mrs. Burne- 
Jones in 1882. Thus could many of us write 
to-day. Whether we regard the European 
chaos, or our own poor success in dealing with 
labor of head or hand, or the present state of 
the arts, they are heavy matters for us, who, 
it seems, " can mend them scarce a whit." 
Perhaps the dominant national feeling, the 
undercurrent which indicates the real flow of 
the river, is that of distress and incompetence. 
To escape it, we gyrate in the eddies, think 
and do the superficial things, and hope that 
God at least is looking after His work. 

Those who would criticize us, as indeed 
we criticize ourselves, may fairly be asked to 
consider whether, after all, they are not wit- 
nessing a necessary stage of our evolution. 
We feel that it must be so, and therein is one 
ray of hope. Some one has said that a man 
who had never reached the conclusion that he 
was an ass, was indeed one, with little chance 
of redemption. It may be so with nations. 

Out of all this came Morris, as we also must 
come, with a programme of salvation. It was 
the present writer's privilege to know him in 
the days of his active Socialistic propaganda, 
and to hear him read, when it was new, his 
stirring " Message of the March Wind " : 

" Yet, love, as we wend, the wind bloweth behind 

us, 

And beareth the last tale it telleth tonight, 
How here in the spring-tide the message shall 

find us; 
For the hope that none seeketh is coming to light. 



546 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



"Like the seed of midwinter, unheeded, unperished, 
Like the autumn-sown wheat 'neath the snow 

lying green, 
Like the love that o'ertook us, unawares and 

uncherished, 
Like the babe 'neath thy girdle that groweth 

unseen ; 

" So the hope of the people now buddeth and 

groweth, 

Rest fadeth before it, and blindness and fear; 
It biddeth us learn all the wisdom it knoweth ; 
It hath found us and held us, and biddeth us 

hear. 

" For it beareth the message : ' Rise up on the 

inorrow, 
And go on your ways toward the doubt and the 

strife ; 
Join hope to our hope and blend sorrow with 

sorrow, 
And seek for men's love in the short days of 

life.' " 

And again, in his lecture on " The Aims of 
Art," he says : 

" The world's roughness, falseness, and injus- 
tice, will bring about their natural consequences, 
and we and our lives are part of those conse- 
quences; but since we inherit also the conse- 
quences of old resistance to those curses, let us 
each look to it to have our fair share of that in- 
heritance also, which, if nothing else come of it, 
will at least bring to us courage and hope ; that is 
eager life while we live, which is above all things 
the Aim of Art." 

So Morris, in a blue suit, looking like some 
sea-captain, stood at street corners on Sunday 
mornings, and tried to give his message to the 
public. Two or three of us, his comrades of 
the Socialist League, would form the nucleus 
of a crowd; miscellaneous passers-by would 
stop to see what was going on, and the indif- 
ferent little assemblages would be treated to 
lectures which many would now pay a good 
price to hear. John Burns tells a good story 
of an occasion when he went out with Morris 
on behalf of the propaganda. Burns, who has 
a voice like a fog-horn, started things, and the 
inhabitants of the little village began to as- 
semble. The crowd obtained, Burns gave way 
to Morris, who was warming up to his subject, 
when Burns plucked his sleeve and warned 
him to stop. Morris obeyed, but was visibly 
annoyed, and wanted to know what was the 
matter with his speech or with the crowd. 
" Well," said Burns, " I had seen what Mor- 
ris had overlooked, that the adjacent 'pub' 
had just opened, and I didn't think it fitting 
that the author of ' The Earthly Paradise ' 



should be left speaking, as he certainly would 
have been, to a baby in a ' pram ' ! " 

So it seemed that all this wave of hope 
and enthusiasm surged against stone walls, 
rebounding upon itself. Even among the 
comrades, within the Socialist League, dissen- 
tion arose, and eventually active educational 
propaganda was abandoned by Morris him- 
self, who took to new and wonderful forms 
of art, whereby we all profit greatly to this 
day. 

It would be logical to ask whether Morris's 
earlier pessimism did not better express the 
reality of things; whether we, in our doubt 
and hesitation, are not facing the real world 
with an understanding of its nature. It 
would be easy to defend ourselves with an 
intellectual cynicism, or to pacify our con- 
sciences with a programme presenting only 
the outward appearance of activity. To one 
who has lived through the last thirty years, 
observing the progress of events, it does in- 
deed appear ludicrous that some of us could 
have believed the " industrial revolution " 
would come before the end of the century; 
but it is none the less evident that the seed so 
passionately sown has brought its harvest. 
The gain was real and substantial, and his- 
tory will see, not poor little crowds of stupid 
people bearing witness, but the whole wide 
world. 

It was extremely characteristic of Morris 
that he threw himself whole-heartedly into 
whatever he chose to do. He had no patience 
with half measures. I remember his scorn 
when the committee of the League had the 
posters announcing the meetings printed on 
pinkish paper, instead of full red. "Why," 
he said, " it looks like revolution and water ! " 
He was essentially constructive in all his aims. 
The Socialistic propaganda took the form of 
an attack on existing society, and to super- 
ficial people it might seem only an effort to 
destroy ; but the mind of Morris, if not of all 
his followers, was illumined by a vision of 
what might be. Must it not be the same with 
us? If our present condition, nationally and 
individually, is but a stage, well and good. 
It remains, however, to see that something 
positive, genuine, and purposeful comes out 
of it all. The spirit of America must emerge 
as a real contribution to civilization. It can 
hardly be said to-day that our literature, our 
educational institutions, or our political or-

ganizations are adequately dealing with the 
problems they confront; they are instead 
seeking lines of the least resistance, trying to 
do what good they can without inconvenience. 
One is almost ready to believe that the Uni- 
versity, which seems to represent the high- 
water mark of our intellectual attainment, 
must suffer from the frailty of its weakest 
link ; gathering together the best the country 
affords, and then levelling downward. Such 
a statement is too extreme ; to express it is to 
fall in some measure into the pessimism we 
condemn ; yet it remains true that unless we 
can react to evil as Morris did, rising on 
wings of seemingly quixotic hope, we must be 
written down as having failed when failure 
was most calamitous to the human race. 

Eecently I witnessed a curiously mixed 
programme in the local theatre. The first 
part of the evening saw the production of a 
long " movie " play, a tale of the wild west, 
dramatic, bloodthirsty, and highly moral. 
The second event was a drama with real 
actors, " War Brides," done by members of 
the women's club, and done extremely well. 
Little as these matters seemed to be related, 
the thoughts they initiated finally met each 
other on the cross-roads, and recognized a 
kinship. The combined result led back to the 
memory of AVilliam Morris, and of his plans 
for human happiness. 

In " The Roots of the Mountains " we find 
a picture of peaceful activity, which for its 
beauty and eloquence, as well as its appro- 
priateness to the present time, is perhaps 
unsurpassed : 

" ' Sweet friend/ he said, ' what thou sayest is 
better than well; for time shall be, if we come 
alive out of this pass of battle and bitter strife, 
when I shall lead thee into Burgdale to dwell there. 
And thou wottest of our people that there is little 
strife and grudging amongst them, and that they 
are merry, and fair to look oh, both men and 
women; and no man there lacketh what the earth 
may give us, and it is a saying amongst us that 
there may a man have that which he desireth save 
the sun and moon in his hands to play with; and 
of this gladness, which is made up of many little 
matters, what story may be told? Yet amongst it 
I shall live and thou with me; and ill indeed it 
were if it wearied thee and thou wert ever longing 
for some day of victorious strife, and to behold me 
coming back from battle high-raised on the shields 
of men and crowned with bay; if thine ears must 
ever be tickled with the talk of men and their 
songs concerning my warrior deeds. For thus it 
shall not be. When I drive the herds it shall be 



at the neighbours' bidding whereso they will; not 
necks of men shall I smite, but the stalks of the 
tall wheat, and the boles of the timber-trees which 
the wood reeve hath marked for felling; the stilts 
of the plough rather than the hilts of the sword 
shall harden my hands; my shafts shall be for 
the deer, and my spears for the wood-boar, till war 
and sorrow fall upon us, and I fight for the ceas- 
ing of war and trouble. And though I be called a 
chief and of the blood of chiefs, yet shall I not be 
masterful to the goodmen of the Dale, but rather 
to my hound ; for my chieftainship shall be that I 
shall be well beloved and trusted, and that no man 
shall grudge against me. Canst thou learn to love 
such a life, which to me seemeth lovely? ' " 

I should like to see this passage graven on a 
tablet, and set in one of the great railroad 
stations of this country, where the seething 
mass of humanity daily passing through 
might pause for a moment and read. Yet in 
reading, we must not let the musical charm 
of the language fill our minds to the exclusion 
of the deeper thought it conveys. The Mor- 
risian doctrine, here expressed, is that happi- 
ness lies in normal self -activity, in doing a 
multitude of little things to serve our needs 
and those of our fellows. The " War Brides " 
drama is first of all an exposure of the 
hideousness of war ; but it is hardly less pow- 
erful as a plea against unjust suppression, the 
denial of the right to be and do. Our sons 
and daughters shall live their proper useful 
lives, and shall not, at the command of some 
external authority, be fed into the jaws of the 
war machine. Nay, if they must come to that, 
there shall be no sons and daughters. 

All this is evident; but what, in this con- 
nection, of the "movies"? The outgoing! 
thought was this : that whereas we rebel, and 
must rebel, against forceful injustice and 
suppression, we may ourselves do what we 
will not permit others to compel, voluntarily 
abandoning our proper activities. Morris 
always rebelled against the tendency to allow 
machines to usurp the pleasurable work of 
man, " labor saving " devices, to save us from 
that which really makes life worth living. He 
hardly contemplated such degradation as the 
turning of our play also over to machines. 
The "movies" may be moral or instructive, 
or may be otherwise, but the " movie " mania, 
like that of athletic "fans," means the ever 
greater extension of sloth, the replacement 
of the humble happy play of other years by 
the mere contemplation of things. Morris did 
indeed recognize and insist upon the impor- 
tance of satisfying the "period of idleness,"

which was one of the great aims of art, but 
he dreaded the cheapening of endeavor by 
competition with devices intended to curtail 
the expenditure of human energy. It was for 
this reason that he wrote his "News from 
Nowhere," to stand against the picture pre- 
sented by Bellamy's "Looking Backward." 
The moving picture, reasonably used, is a 
beneficial invention ; even Morris would never 
have gone so far as to regret the existence of 
the printing press, in which machinery takes 
the place of hand-work on a vast scale. Argu- 
ing as a lawyer, we can make it appear that 
there is no logical basis for objecting to mod- 
ern methods of entertainment ; yet those who 
thoughtfully contemplate the facts have rea- 
son to be alarmed lest we, having won free- 
dom and peace, may sacrifice the due fruits 
of these blessings to the god of sloth. 

T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



SOME AMERICAN NOVELISTS AND 
THE LAME ART. 



A very pretty quarrel seems to be going on 
in the pages of " The Atlantic Monthly." It 
is taking a somewhat leisurely course, as it 
began about a year ago. The opening shot 
was fired by a red-coat, Mr. Edward Garnett, 
introduced in the "Atlantic" (on the author- 
ity of a popular English novelist) as "the 
most valuable of British critics." If he is 
that, there was little evidence of it in " Some 
Remarks on American and British Fiction." 
No doubt conditions were unfavorable. The 
editor of the "Atlantic " had asked him to say 
a little something; and, without special in- 
clination or preparation, he did just that. It 
was only for American consumption, anyhow. 
The result was a casual and rather bungling 
attack upon American letters, and especially 
current American fiction. America (it is to 
be supposed) sat up. Clearly something must 
be said for our literary Stars and Stripes; 
and the "Atlantic" presently put a champion 
in the field. This, of course, was not a critic 
(since we have no critics), but a popular 
novelist and man of the world. So Mr. 
Owen Wister, entering the arena, proclaims 
in a clear voice that Mr. Garnett is right, that 
we have no current fiction of value, and that 
this is due to the venality or impotence of our 
criticism, the slack ambitions of our novelists, 
and the hopeless stupidity of our "reading 
public." America sat up again. It was plain 
enough that while Mr. Wister had told some 
home truths he had also restated many 



ancient and lamentable fallacies, and had 
ignored the real issue. Here, if we had pos- 
sessed such a thing as a critic, would have 
been an appropriate moment to call upon 
him, so that we might at least stand a chance 
of discovering what we were talking about. 
In default of that, the "Atlantic" did the 
best it could by calling upon a second popular 
American novelist, Mr. Meredith Nicholson, 
to take up the cudgels in the cause, whatever 
that might be. Mr. Nicholson, in " The Open 
Season for American Novelists," turned out 
a very graceful and amusing piece of writing, 
in the course of which he gently chaffed Mr. 
Garnett, Mr. Wister, and the rest of us, and 
came to the sound conclusion that, after 
all, there is nothing whatever to be gained 
for American literature by the habit of 
scolding. 

Well, some of us breathed easier after that. 
It was reassuring to feel that our literary 
estate was not so desperate that it could not 
still be smiled about. To be sure, Mr. Nichol- 
son had not altogether cleared up the situa- 
tion, and there might still have been room, if 
we had had a critic . However, that being 
out of the question, the little exchange of 
more or less random shots seemed to be in 
some sense " over " ; when lo ! in the current 
number of the "Atlantic " a new champion 
appears, far more fierce and determined than 
his predecessors. This, under the conditions, 
could be none other than a third popular 
American novelist, Mr. Henry Sydnor Har- 
rison. Him, on the evidence of his bearing, 
I take to be a volunteer, zealous for the 
cause, and actually intent upon finding out 
what the cause is. What he believes he has 
found is suggested by his title, " Conven- 
tional Critics and Poor America." The issue 
is between the novelists and the people of 
America on the one hand, and the " genteel 
critics," as Mr. Wister calls them, on the 
other. Those gentry, as far as we can make 
out, are damned from the cradle, since criti- 
cism (unless, we suppose, as practised by 
popular novelists) is, according to Mr. Har- 
rison, "the lamest of all arts." The sting in 
his title is that it includes Mr. Wister! Mr. 
Harrison announces with joy, which I for one 
have not the heart to grudge him, that in his 
"Atlantic" utterance the older novelist has 
shown himself no better than a critic, the 
hidebound timid genteel critic whom he has 
crushed beneath a passing heel. Of course 
the new champion has no difficulty in getting 
under his victim's fifth (or critical) rib 
(even THE DIAL may be said to have done 
that!). Mr. Harrison, taking him to repre- 
sent the best that "authorised criticism" in 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



549 



America can put forward, handles him ex- 
haustively. If there is anything left to be 
done to Mr. Wister in connection with his 
article, " Quack Novels and Democracy," it 
does not occur to us at the moment. After a 
slight attempt at the urbane ironical manner, 
Mr. Harrison throws caution to the winds, 
and goes at his adversary with the bare 
knuckles. The result is not the less amusing 
by reason of Mr. Harrison's devout conviction 
that he is disposing of two adversaries by 
knocking their heads together. Mr. Wister 
has said that critics are fools and weaklings. 
So they are. But Mr. Wister himself is one 
of them: therefore by showing up Mr. Wis- 
ter's folly and feebleness you are polishing 
off the whole breed. 

For example : Mr. Wister damns the Amer- 
ican " reading public " because some millions 
of persons read the works of one Harold Bell 
Wright. Mr. Harrison makes the point that 
there are many distinct reading publics, and 
that most of them do, on the whole, respond 
to and support good work. These are excel- 
lent points. That they are frequently reit- 
erated by professional critics, and are, indeed, 
among the truisms of the trade, would no 
doubt have disabled them in Mr. Harrison's 
mind, if he had but known ! 

All this kind of thing is delightful if incon- 
clusive : there appears to be no reason why it 
should not go on for some time, since there 
are doubtless other popular story-tellers 
among us, who might be induced to try their 
hands at the lame art of criticism.

LITERARY AFFAIRS IN LONDON. 

NEW PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES. AN ALL-EMBRAC- 
ING EPIC. THE CHRISTMAS BOOK SEASON. 
WAR BOOKS. A PROHIBITED NOVEL. MR. 
SHAW'S NEW PLAY. 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

The publishing season drags its slow length 
along without anything of much importance 
appearing. Of the few notable books that do 
appear, most are translations; and among 
them there are some of old books of which 
we could well have done with English versions 
before. The firm of Stanley Paul, for exam- 
ple, is issuing a six- volume edition of Saint 
Simon's Memoirs, containing all one wants of 
them; and Nelson's have very enterprisingly 
brought out a much compressed but very well 
chosen translation of the Journal of the de 
Goncourts, a book which gives a better idea of 
nineteenth century literary France than any 
other work ever written. Another volume of 



the " Cambridge History of Modern Litera- 
ture" has lumbered out, regardless of Arma- 
geddon ; a few small books of criticism, a few 
bad books of verse, and a good many so-so 
novels (mostly with a war-chapter at the end !) 
have also been added to the year's total. One 
of the volumes of " poetry " I really must men- 
tion : no amateur of the curious can afford to 
miss it. Its title is " The Chronicles of Man " ; 
its author's name is C. Fillingham Coxwell; 
the poem is written in of all things in the 
world rhymed Alexandrines; and it chal- 
lenges the position of " The Faerie Queene " 
as the longest epic in the language. Modern 
England already possessed one highly ambi- 
tious epic poet in the person of Mr. J. Row- 
botham, an elderly gentleman who describes 
himself in advertisements as " The Modern 
Homer." He has written " The Epic of Crea- 
tion," '' The Epic of the Devil," and so on ; 
and from time to time, clad in a bardic robe, 
he gives public recitations from them in Lon- 
don. But Mr. Coxwell beats him hollow. All 
knowledge is his province: and almost all 
knowledge has gone into his epic. It contains 
the whole history of man, from the Javanese 
excursions of the pithecanthropus erectus to 
the sinking of the " Falaba." Every religion, 
every civilization, every great movement in 
politics, art, and thought, the disputations of 
Duns Scotus, the conquests of Alexander and 
the Grand Duke Nicholas, everything you 
can imagine passes across his screen, and he 
finally deposits the exhausted pilgrim of eter- 
nity upon the still-contested banks of the 
Bzura and the Rawka. It will take the minor 
versifiers of two hemispheres some time to go 
one better than this. 

The prospects of Christmas publishing are 
not bright. The organized publishers are now 
conducting a National Book Fortnight of 
propaganda, in order to promote the con- 
sumption of their products ; but it is scarcely 
likely that a publicity campaign will induce 
people to read books who otherwise would be 
playing billiards, arguing about the war, or 
going to what are now called Cinedromes and, 
last abomination of all, Picturedromes. A cer- 
tain number of expensive gift books have 
begun to appear; one of the best actually 
breaks new ground, being a book on Bridges 
beautifully illustrated by Mr. Frank Brang- 
wyn. But nobody can really say how far 
people will abstain from this kind of Christ- 
mas present; a partner in one very promi- 
nent firm tells me that the only picture-book 
of the kind that is to come from his office is 
one which was originally to be priced at a 



550 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



guinea, and which is now, owing to the econ- 
omical proclivities of the war-time public, to 
be priced at six shillings. Pessimism is not 
universal: a few publishers are doing well, 
and immense quantities of sevenpenny re- 
prints are being sold. But publishers as a 
body do not expect their Christmas to be as 
Merry as usual. 

Some people, perhaps, may be tempted into 
unintentional irony by the chance of giving 
their friends new War Books as Christmas 
presents. I need scarcely say that the war 
books are still pouring out, though few of 
them can be really profitable to their pro- 
ducers. The flood shrank a little in the sum- 
mer ; almost every person with a name in any 
sort of sphere had written a War Book, and 
we hoped for a rest. But no: they were 
merely pausing to return with reinvigorated 
lungs. Mr. G. K. Chesterton is about to pro- 
duce his third war book: and, needless to 
remark, what he has to say is epoch-making 
compared with what most of the others emit. 
A few intelligent and thoughtful works are 
buried in the mass ; but the vapidity, banality, 
and, above all, egoism of the great majority 
of them are indescribable. Why, merely be- 
cause there is a war on, should Professor 
Bilgewater write about Nietzsche, of whom, 
two years ago, he had never heard? Why, 
because France has been invaded, should Miss 
Marianne Nokes, normally a purveyor of su- 
burban fiction, give us pictures of herself with 
France as a background? Day after day 
they surge forth : " Life in a German Grocer's 
Family," "Attila and the Kaiser," " Krupp 
and Kultur," " The Real Schopenhauer," "Ar- 
mageddon and After," "My Week in a Hos- 
pital," " What I Think of the War," "A Short- 
Story Writer in Tortured Belgium," "The 
Alsace-Lorraine Problem through Sussex 
Eyes," " O God ! Montreal ! " as Samuel 
Butler remarked when he met the man whose 
brother-in-law had been haberdasher to Mr. 
Spurgeon. It is small consolation to feel that 
the civilian populations of our enemies' coun- 
tries are going through a similar ordeal. 

The one mild literary sensation of the 
autumn has been the prosecution and confis- 
cation of Mr. D. H. Lawrence's new novel, 
" The Rainbow." The prosecution resulted 
from some exceedingly intemperate criticisms 
in the press; one of our horrified mandarins 
even going so far as to say that Zola is 
" child's food " to Lawrence which is asinine. 
Had it not been for the predominance of a 
somewhat more important subject of public 
interest, we should certainly have had a re- 



newal of newspaper discussion on the literary 
censorship, and, probably, manifestos by all 
our advanced litterateurs concerning the 
necessity of securing free speech for the artist. 
It is not that "The Rainbow" has many ad- 
mirers. It is a dull book, choppily written ; 
and there is a gloomy ferocity about its 
author's insistence upon the physical phe- 
nomena of sex which you could scarcely find 
in any other English-speaking novelist. Parts 
of it are certainly repulsive; and all of it is 
morbid. The grievance is, not that a great 
work of art has been lost to the world by what 
Americans, I believe, call Comstockery; but 
that the book is no more offensive than many 
works which are not interfered with ; and that, 
in any case, it is desirable that the greatest 
possible amount of rope should, on principle, 
be allowed to writers whose bona fides is un- 
questionable. And Mr. Lawrence's certainly 
is. His seriousness is so profound as to be 
almost painful to watch. 

He has undeniably a strain of genius in him, 
though " The Rainbow " itself is an exceed- 
ingly tedious affair. This strain comes out, 
to some extent, in his early novels (he is still 
only twenty-eight), but still more in "Sons 
and Lovers," in the volume of short stories 
called " The Prussian Officer," and in his 
verse. He has written nothing perfect ; his is 
an achievement of flashes. But even those 
who are most repelled by his brutality and his 
obsession with the body he appears to be 
under the influence of Freud, and there is a 
good deal of Strindberg in him recognize 
the occasional wonderful exactitude of his 
observation and his phraseology. There are 
sentences in his writing which burn across the 
page like flames leaping into the smoky mid- 
night pall of a factory district. His gifts are 
gifts of sight; his defects are defects of 
thought. Philosophizing is obscuring his 
spark of genius; if he does not pull himself 
together his work will deteriorate. But he is 
one of the very few men amongst the younger 
English novelists who is worth a second look. 
He has a strong and compact body of ad- 
mirers; and there has naturally been a good 
deal of indignation at his name being dragged 
through the mud in a police court and his 
novel being stigmatized by a shocked barrister 
as "a bawdy volume." If they had let the 
book alone its dulness would have condemned 
it to an early oblivion ; as it is, one hears that 
such copies as have got about are changing 
hands privately at fabulous prices! 

No sooner had this case been heard than there 
was a rumor that the production of Mr. Shaw's 
new play, "O'Flaherty V. C.," which is an- 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



551 



nounced to be put on at the Abbey Theatre, 
Dublin, shortly, had been forbidden by the 
authorities. The play has not been published 
but one knows roughly its drift. When the 
great Michael O'Leary won his Victoria Cross 
an evil story went round London. It was to 
the effect that, on hearing, in her remote 
Hibernian retreat of her son's great feat, the 
hero's mother observed, " I always knew that 
Michael was the broth of a bhoy, but I little 
thought that I would live to see the day when 

he would kill eight b y Englishmen." The 

complex relations of Irishmen towards each 
other, towards England, and towards the war 
naturally lured Mr. Shaw; something of the 
spirit, and even of the letter, of the O'Leary 
anecdote has got into the play ; and though the 
dramatist's conclusions as to Irishmen's course 
of action are, from an Englishman's point of 
view, admirable, it is a perilous thing to make 
jests at a time like this. However, as I write, 
the report of the "banning" of the play is 
contradicted, and we may possibly see it after 
all. Mr. Shaw's preoccupation with the top- 
ical in the last year has not been quite com- 
plete. He has written a preface for his forth- 
coming volume of plays ("Androcles," etc.), 
which is said to be the best preface he has ever 
done. It examines Christianity and the Bible 
de novo; and it concludes, I understand, with 
the suggestion, Why not Try Christianity? 
That is a very revolutionary proposal.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A GRACEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A LIT- 
ERARY HONOR comes from Mr. Howells's pen 
on the occasion of the award to him, by the 
National Institute of Arts and Letters, of its 
gold medal, the highest distinction bestowed 
by that body for achievement in any of the 
fine arts. Especially noteworthy is this 
award because he is the first novelist to be 
thus honored, and his words of acceptance 
were both worthy of the occasion and finely 
illustrative of his style as a master of English. 
It is an intellectual recreation to read such 
sentences as these from his letter of acknowl- 
edgment: "A rumor of one of those good 
things which seem too good to be true has 
come to me with such insistence that I must 
take it for a fact, and I am asking the secre- 
tary of the Institute to acknowledge it for me. 
I know he will fitly account for my not doing 
this in person, and I will not hamper him 
with any expression of my preference as to 



how he shall convey to you my sense of the 
supreme honor which your award of the 
' Medal for Fiction ' has done me. In the last 
analysis I find this sense a sort of dismay 
which it would be difficult to render. Yet I 
will not pretend that it is altogether the 
unexpected that has happened, or that, with 
whatever consciousness of demerit, I did not 
hope it might happen. . . So far as pure criti- 
cism has governed your vote, I might say that 
the novelist to whom you have done the great- 
est honor that the world could do him has 
striven for excellence in his art with no 
divided motive, unless the constant endeavor 
for truth is want of fealty to fiction. The 
fashion of this world passes away, and I have 
seen it come and go in my art, or phases of it. 
The best novel of my day is not the best novel 
of yours in some of these." Finally, says Mr. 
Howells, " I prize your award more than all 
the words of my many books could say." 


EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE OF EASY WRITING 
AND HARD READING are probably, if the truth 
were known, not many. The man who with- 
out conscious effort masters the art of perfect 
literary expression is not born oftener than 
once in a century, though examples are not 
wanting of remarkable effectiveness in the use 
of the pen on the part of men given to action 
rather than to letters. We approve and 
admire the conscientious toil of a Flaubert 
agonizing for the one supremely appropriate 
word, and of a Pater with his little squares 
of paper on which he wrote and re-wrote his 
exquisite sentences, which he afterward re- 
vised and re-revised in the proof ; but we greet 
with a more spontaneous burst of applause 
him who dashes off his literary masterpiece 
with one rapid stroke of the pen. Lincoln's 
Gettysburg address, hastily pencilled on the 
backs of old envelopes on the train that was 
carrying him to the place of delivery, is a 
classic, even though a somewhat mythical, 
instance; and Grant's facility of impromptu 
written expression as shown by his despatches 
from the field, and to some extent, one sus- 
pects, by his published memoirs, is another 
and more authentic example. A few days ago 
Senator Lodge, addressing the Massachusetts 
Historical Society, paid tribute to the mem- 
ory of its deceased president, Charles Francis 
Adams, and in enumerating the talents and 
achievements of that distinguished descendant 
of distinguished men took occasion to say: 
" From the earliest beginnings in the days of 
the college and the law office he wrote easily 
and well. He seems never to have passed 
through the severe struggle necessary to most

men when learning to express themselves in 
writing with force and lucidity. Yet the old 
saying that easy writing makes hard reading 
does not apply in his ease. All that Charles 
Adams wrote is eminently readable." Never- 
theless the old saying is one that very few can 
afford to forget. ... 

AN EMBARGO ON LITERATURE WOuld Seem to 

mean a relapse into the dark ages. That a 
highly cultured nation of western Europe 
should adopt measures to prevent the export 
of printed matter, of any class not clearly 
obnoxious, would have seemed, a year and a 
half ago, a ludicrously absurd impossibility. 
Yet to-day we have an English correspondent 
of the New York "Evening Post" writing 
thus to that journal: "All our liberties are 
being taken from us one by one, and after 
to-morrow (or a few days later) we may send 
no more pamphlets to America. Militarism is 
daily more and more fastening itself upon us, 
and many of us cannot see where the differ- 
ence lies between our militarism and the Prus- 
sian form we are supposed to be out to kill! " 
Demoralizing to any country must be the 
effects of long-continued armed strife, and 
there is no cause for surprise in the further 
contents of the letter, which, with a few 
changes, might have been written from any 
one of half .a dozen or more European coun- 
tries. " The degeneration of our own people, 
morally, intellectually, and spiritually, is the 
most serious result of the war. If I could 
give you the details of what is happening 
along these lines I do not think you would 
believe me, as it is almost impossible to believe 
it myself. The indirect evils of war are even 
greater than the direct ones." A number of 
pamphlets issued by the Union of Democratic 
Control are sent by the writer, before the 
interdict goes into effect, and American aid is 
asked for the work engaged in by that society. 
No name is signed or address given, but 
inquiry of the above-mentioned newspaper 
would perhaps elicit details. 



BILL PRATT, SAW-BUCK PHILOSOPHER, whose 
memory is cherished in humorous affection by 
Williams graduates of the middle and late 
nineteenth century, was one of those unlau- 
reated men of nondescript genius encountered 
from time to time on every college campus, 
and the source of untold entertainment and 
perhaps also some inspiration to the succes- 
sive classes that come and go, that wax and 
wane, while these uncatalogued stars in the 
academic firmament shine on, if not forever, 
yet often for as many decades as can be 
counted on the fingers of one hand. And now 



Bill's life and labors have been made the sub- 
ject of a book, they have been preserved for 
all time in literary form, by two alumni who 
were in college with Bill, though not reciting 
from exactly the same textbook or pursuing 
the same courses with him. It was meet that 
he should have his history related by Williams 
men, for he was himself first and foremost a 
Williams man. " He had wormed his way 
into college life," says his biography, " far 
back in the homespun times when 'there 
war n't no buildin's there but East College, 
West College, and the gable-end of a car- 
tridge-box,' and he refused to be counted out. 
It troubled him little that he had no learning, 
for he had learned to love life and could teach 
even the students themselves something on 
that score." Through six decades Bill sawed 
wood, blacked stoves, sold apples and pop- 
corn, "made music," practised oratory, and 
upheld the dignity and glory of his adopted 
college, as will be found duly recorded in his 
authorized biography, by Mr. John Sheridan 
Zelie and Mr. Carroll Perry. From this book, 
entitled "Bill Pratt the Saw-buck Philoso- 
pher," and published by Mr. Talcott M. 
Banks, Williamstown, Mass., we quote, in 
closing, a passage illustrative of Bill the ora- 
tor. It is from "A Funeral Address delivered 
in front of West College after the passage of 
a funeral procession." "Murmur and mourn! 
The language of life is past. The grass of 
gullory is gone and the electricity of the 
bay-rum tree is decided with the laments of 
refuge. Oh, he was a good man. How the 
grasshoppers of his belief floundered with the 
winds of his whiffle-trees. What a burden he 
was! What a beautiful Pharisee! By the 
corduroy of his attainments and the melody 
of his magnificence he retired and the palms 
of his pussy-willows wave with the Rolling 
Ottaw." . . . 

A WORD ABOUT ACADEMY-MAKING, by One of 

the founders of the organization from which 
sprang the society which in turn gave birth 
to our American Academy of Arts and Let- 
ters, may be of interest in connection with 
the recent annual meeting of that body and 
its bestowal of a gold medal on its absent 
president, Mr. W. D. Howells. Mr. Frank B. 
Sanborn writes in his weekly Boston liter- 
ary letter to the Springfield "Republican": 
"Another society, bearing the name of the 
American Institute of Arts and Letters, met 
here on Thursday. . . This institute was 
formed by the Social Science mother organi- 
zation in 1898." Correcting some erroneous 
impressions prevalent in regard to this asso- 
ciation, he continues: "Dr. Charles W.

Eliot was never the president of the Social 
Scientists, who had for presidents, in succes- 
sion, President Rogers of the ' Tech ' [Mass. 
Institute of Technology] , George William Cur- 
tis, President Angell of Michigan, President 
Gilman of Johns Hopkins, President White of 
Cornell, Dean Wayland of Yale, Oscar S. 
Straus, F. J. Kingsbury, and others. It was a 
nephew of Mr. Kingsbury, Dr. Holbrook Curtis 
of New York, who suggested the formation of 
this Institute, to be made up partly from exist- 
ing members of the parent body and partly 
from artists and authors outside, and for sev- 
eral years the starred list of Institute members 
was printed in the annual Journal of Social 
Science, which I edited for some thirty years. 
Out of these original Institute brethren was 
developed a smaller body, an American 
Academy, which seeks to hold a rank like that 
of the French Academy, and has advanced 
measurably in that direction." In conclusion 
the somewhat melancholy fact is noted that 
"meanwhile the mother society of social 
science has gone into cold storage, and no 
longer holds meetings, having long outlived 
its parent, the British Social Science Associa- 
tion, formed ,by Lord Brougham and his 
friend, G. W. Hastings, before our Civil 
War." . . 

SIMPLE SIMONS OF THE CENSORSHIP have 
been provoking the mirth of Great Britain's 
leading comic paper, the sprightly sheet pub- 
lished weekly at 10 Bouverie Street, and it 
prints a few quasi-official regulations for the 
guidance of incautious ' persons addicted to 
careless quotation from the poets. Thus, one 
must no longer say, or sing, or write, " Drink 
to me only with thine eyes," for fear of sug- 
gesting to the enemy a defective water sup- 
ply. " Come into the garden, Maud " should 
be "Come into the basement, Maud" (see 
official directions) . Fond memory ought until 
further notice to refrain from bringing the 
light of other days, or any light whatsoever, 
around one, for obvious reasons (see police 
regulations). Even "Mary had a little 
lamb " is objectionable, as suggesting a short- 
age in the food supply. All persons desirous 
of promoting the effectiveness of this censbr- 
ship are, we assume, at liberty to mention 
other instances of dangerously ambiguous 
lines or couplets or stanzas. For instance, 
one might point out the peril in the first line 
of Gray's Pindaric ode, "Ruin seize thee, 
ruthless King ! " In place of this last word 
another, also beginning with K. should be 
substituted, lest in the present hair-trigger 
condition of the Balkan States King Constan- 
tine of Greece or Ferdinand of Roumania 



should think himself meant and take offense, 
to the serious detriment of Great Britain and 
her allies. Again, Pope's "Lend, lend your 
wings, I mount ! I fly !" is obviously trea- 
sonable, as if the domestic supply of aircraft 
were inadequate! Those of us who have 
received in our foreign mail letters tampered 
with by the censor can heap coals of fire on 
his head by sending in valuable suggestions 
like the foregoing. 

" THE GREATEST MENACE TO UNIVERSAL EDU- 
CATION," declares the editor of the "Wiscon- 
sin Library Bulletin," though he qualifies the 
assertion with a " possibly " that might safely 
enough have been omitted, "is the cessation 
of the educational processes immediately upon 
leaving school." It is then urged upon all 
concerned to teach the pupil the use of the 
public library, since if this is done he will be 
likely to make the library his continuation 
school. The school period is the time, par 
excellence, "to beat a path to the public 
library" and to become enamoured of its 
chaste delights. Apropos of this, or of any- 
thing you please, there conies to mind the 
enthusiastic vein in which the learned Hein- 
sius, the classical philologist of Leyden, sings 
the praises of the library there. " I no sooner 
come into the library," said he, "than I bolt 
the door to me [figuratively speaking], ex- 
cluding Lust, Ambition, Avarice, and all such 
vices, whose nurse is Idleness, the mother of 
Ignorance and Melancholy. In the very lap 
of eternity, amongst so many divine souls, I 
take my seat with so lofty a spirit and sweet 
content, that I pity all our great ones and 
rich men that knew not this happiness." 
Heinsius made this resort his continuation 
school to the end of his life of scholarly 
industry. . . . 

SOME ANECDOTES OF THE LATE SlR JAMES 

MURRAY, editor of the monumental Oxford 
Dictionary, are sent to us by our Paris corre- 
spondent, Mr. Theodore Stanton. While one 
of the early letters of the alphabet was being 
dealt with, a Scotticism describing a certain 
part of the hoof of cattle puzzled the Oxford 
lexicographers. Finally Sir James decided to 
consult the tenant on his Roxburghshire farm. 
" He is very intelligent, and will tell us what 
is meant by this word." A few days later 
came by parcel post a package which carried 
with it a very strong odor, and by mail a 
letter from the farmer, who wrote: "Not 
understanding just what part you referred to, 
I thought it best to send you the whole leg." 
A reader of Stevenson's works for the Dic- 
tionary sent in a word that could be found in

no other lexicon ; so Sir James turned to the 
author himself for the definition, and by 
return of post received these lines written on 
a post card: " For heaven's sake don't touch 
that word; it is simply a typographical 
error ! " A story characteristic of that other 
eccentric Oxfordian, Professor Freeman, is 
the following : Sdr James had six sons and 
five daughters, and to all of them he gave old 
Anglo-Saxon names, the boys taking those of 
the kings. Freeman dropped in one day to 
congratulate the Hurrays on an addition to 
the family, and asked: "Well, what is the 
name this time?" "Ethelbald, the seventh," 
was the reply. Whereupon, the historian, so 
particular in minutiae, forgetting all about th. 
real object of his visit, remarked rather quer- 
ulously, "Why, Dr. Murray, you ought to 
know that there was but one King Ethelbald." 
"Yes," came the quiet reply, "but this is my 
seventh." ... 

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CURIOSITIES OF LIT- 
ERATURE, however inconsiderable, is never out 
of order among the lovers of such odds and 
ends of unclassifiable lore. Not all the inter- 
esting things of this sort are gathered within 
the ample volumes of the industrious Disraeli 
the elder. For instance, he lived too early to 
note the following: Edward FitzGerald, as 
all FitzGeraldians will recall, used to pride 
himself on having constructed the worst line 
of poetry to be found in all literature, though 
Thackeray ( or was it Spedding, or some other 
of the FitzGerald circle?) obstinately con- 
tended with him for the honors of author- 
ship. It was a line in heroic metre, -but 
hardly heroic in any other respect, and ran 
thus: 

"A Mr. Wilkinson, a clergyman." 

The exact date of the composition of this 
masterpiece it would now be difficult if not 
impossible to ascertain, but it is safe to ascribe 
it to the poet's earlier years, the period of life 
when such inspirations are far more frequent 
than in the sere and yellow leaf of senescence. 
Consequently it may be placed before 1865, 
when there appeared a book in which we have 
discovered this identical line, buried in the 
prose of a fictitious narrative. It is enclosed 
in no quotation marks, and the plagiarism has 
every appearance of being unconscious. The 
book is Anthony Trollope's "Miss Mackenzie," 
and the passage occurs in chapter ten, where 
Miss Baker conveys an invitation to the hero- 
ine to attend a tea-party at Miss Todd's, at 
which there is expected to be present, she 
says, " a Mr. Wilkinson, a clergyman." Has 
the world hitherto been conscious of the 
double fame of this clerical gentleman? 



GEMS OF PUREST RAY SERENE from the 
depths of the Atlantic not the dark un- 
fathomed caves of the ocean, but the pages 
of the magazine are gathered and displayed 
attractively in that annual reminder of the 
swift passage of time, " The Atlantic Monthly 
Almanac." In its issue for 1916 are to be 
noted, in addition to zodiacal signs, moons in 
all phases, useful tidings respecting tides, and 
other like matters common to all almanacs, 
such bits of sifted wisdom as this by Mrs. 
Katharine Fullerton Gerould in the October 
issue of the magazine : " There are two argu- 
ments against teaching our children Greek: 
one, that it is too hard; the other, that it is 
useless. No person who could be influenced 
by either has the remotest conception of the 
meaning or the value of culture." And here, 
for the month of December, are some brave 
words, peculiarly timely, but too little likely to 
be taken seriously in this year of [dis] grace: 
" I believe that it is both possible and right to 
live like the lilies of the field and the birds of 
the air; to sell all that one has and give to 
the poor, winning an unseen treasure ; to lend 
without expecting a return ; to allow all that 
one has to go from one unprotesting." Once 
more: "Art for art's sake if it ever meant 
what it said, which is doubtful was always 
a vain and silly cry. As well contend that an 
artist is not a man. Art was ever the servant 
as well as the mistress of men, and ever will 
be." So spake John Galsworthy. There are 
worse books to read than almanacs some 
almanacs. . . 

READING WITH THE EYES, but not with the 
mind, is a lamentably easy thing to do, as 
thousands have discovered to their sorrow. 
It is even possible and in fact not very diffi- 
cult to read aloud intelligibly and with some 
degree of appropriate expression while the 
mind is occupied with alien matters. No be- 
ginning reader could do this any more than 
a beginning piano pupil could render a 
Chopin nocturne while discussing the Har- 
vard-Yale football game; but both are possi- 
ble with sufficient practice. Nevertheless it 
is a pernicious habit to get into, this scatter- 
ing of one's mental energies; and we learn 
with approval that Professor Edward L. 
Thorndike, of Teachers College, New York, 
has invented a device for testing the child's 
degree of mental concentration upon the read- 
ing matter placed before him for perusal. 
No repetition by rote is required of the 
reader, but the test is one of interpretation 
rather than of memory. As was to be expected 
of one versed in the laboratory methods of 
educational psychology, Dr. Thorndike has 



1915] 



THE DIAL

made his test severely accurate, even mathe- 
matically so, and there will be no rule-of- 
thumb rating of the young pupil's ability to 
read intelligently. The subject is fully dis- 
cussed in the November issue of " The Teach- 
ers College Record." 



A DEFENCE OF FINE LIBRARY BUILDINGS IS 

made by Mr. Adam Strohm, head of the 
Detroit Public Library, in his current yearly 
Report. As is well known, that city needs 
and is hoping soon to have a new library 
building, plans for which are now under dis- 
cussion. Some of the citizens advise the use 
of a cheap material for construction; others 
desire a palace of marble. The proper re- 
joinder to the former class, Mr. Strohm 
believes is this: "Mean surroundings make 
mean people; things of beauty cleanse our 
hearts. True architecture, as any other artis- 
tic expression of the human mind, has a social 
function to perform in the liberal education 
of mankind. A building should be a dignified 
and proper self-expression of its purpose and 
of the spirit within; the revelation of one's 
self is largely by the 'front' we make; our 
modes of expression, our taste revealed and 
good manners practised in public and in pri- 
vate. 'Architecture is the work of nations.' 
Public statues, public buildings of charm and 
beauty are public assets not extravagances." 
This and more in the same vein cannot but 
encourage hope that the advocates of marble 
may win the day over the advocates of con- 
crete. Ill fares the city where automobiles 
accumulate and architecture decays. 



FRENZIED FONETICS can scarcely hope to 
displace our present spelling, however irra- 
tional that spelling may be. Attention has 
occasionally been called in these columns to 
the amusing extravagances of the English 
periodical, " The Pioneer of Simplified Spel- 
ing." Still more startling in its proposals for 
the reform of our written speech is the little 
publication. "Fonetik Englic," put forth by 
Mr. Edward P. Foster of Marietta, Ohio. 
Mr. Foster is already known to many as the 
inventor of "Ro" (a universal language) and 
editor of its monthly organ, " World Speech." 
His conception of phonetic English is illus- 
trated by the subjoined paragraph from the 
little pamphlet explaining the merits of his 
system : " Foloiq dhi kiy tu pronunsiecrt 
givn below wiy print paragrafs furst in ordi- 
nary Englic speliq, and dhen, for komparisn 
and praktis, in dhi propozd fonetik speliq. 
Dhis method iz dhi awtkom ov yiyrz ov study 
and diskucn, and korespondens widh speliq- 



ref ormerz." With all the schemes now ferment- 
ing for the reform of our spelling, a person 
might enjoy the privilege, if he chose to 
claim it, of writing his own name in as many 
different ways as it was the pleasure of Shake- 
speare and others of his time to write theirs. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

SOME FUETHEE EEMAEKS ABOUT BEY ANT. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

" Youth will be served," as Mr. Jack London has 
reminded us ; and when it cannot be, one of its favor- 
ite exclamations, a historic one, in fact, is, " Go up, 
bald head ! " In not these precise words, but in 
words to that effect, Miss Harriet Monroe (who, as 
the editress of "Poetry," the "official organ" of 
the " new " movement, in the beginning communi- 
cated to it the principal propulsive power neces- 
sary to its launching) addressed the venerable shade 
of William Cullen Bryant at a notable literary 
gathering in the city of Chicago a few months ago. 
I chanced to be present, and the unexpectedness of 
the attack, as well as its unwarrantedness or 
what I felt to be such caused me to contribute 
to THE DIAL a communication in which I endeav- 
ored to show why Bryant, seeing that he pleaded 
most eloquently for poetical freedom, should have 
been immune from such an onslaught. That Miss 
Monroe has returned to the attack, the readers of 
THE DIAL also know and how. Not content with 
condemning Bryant as a poet, she has stigmatized 
him as dishonest and" double-dealing as a man. 
And when, in my turn, I have sought to refute 
these charges, she has returned yet again to her 
self -evidently so-congenial task, and endeavors to 
still further blacken his reputation. 

I do not propose categorically to examine and 
reply to the various " points " raised by Miss 
Monroe in her communication of November 15. 
This is because the fresh " evidence " she presents 
is too flimsy in itself and too flimsily presented to 
call for such procedure. For instance, Miss Mon- 
roe's original attack upon the integrity of Bryant 
was made upon the authority of a " New York 
publisher" whom she did not name. When asked 
for his name, she confesses that he was not a 
publisher at all. He was the late John Denisori 
Champlin, who was aforetime in the employ of 
the house of Scribner and did for them much mis- 
cellaneous editorial work. Now, for my part, I 
cannot accept the late Mr. Champlin as a court of 
last resort in such a case. Particularly, I cannot 
because Mr. Champlin should have been one of 
the last men to bring charges of editorial sins 
against Bryant. Miss Monroe quotes him as the 
" chief author or compiler " of those two reference 
works, " Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings " 
and " Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians," two 
works with which I happen to have long been 
familiar, and which I can testify are, in an edito- 
rial sense, not more shoddy than they are ram- 
shackle works honeycombed with errors alike of 
omission and of commission. The most pretentious 



556 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



claims were made for these works upon their ap- 
pearance; but how jerry-built they are can easily 
be ascertained by comparing them, critically, with 
Bryan's and with Grove's works in the same 
metiers. 

No, I want something besides the casual chat- 
ter of the late Mr. Champlin as a basis of belief. 
But even if I did not, observe the sweet reasona- 
bleness of Miss Monroe, who asks me to dismiss 
the printed assertions of Bryant's publishers as 
examples of tergiversation and truth-stretching, 
and accept the garrulities of Mr. Champlin as gos- 
pel ! Observe it, furthermore, when, in her porten- 
tous list of publications to which Bryant basely 
" sold his name and venerable portrait " for adver- 
tising purposes, we find two works that appeared 
in 1879 when Bryant himself died in June, 
1878. One of these works, it appears, was pub- 
lished by the house of Appleton and the other by 
the house of Putnam, two names which, as all 
lovers of good literature are aware, still appear in 
the pages of THE DIAL devoted to publishers' 
announcements. Perhaps there are old members 
of these firms yet active who can relate how the 
august shade of Bryant returned from the spirit 
land via the Society for Psychical Research, 
maybe ! to seal with them the iniquitous bar- 
gains by which an unsuspecting public was yet 
again to be flim-flammed ! 

I will, however, dwell for a moment upon this 
portentous, this so deeply damning, list of Miss 
Monroe's because it brings out one thing which is, 
I think, worth passing mention. It contains eleven 
items, and with one exception these items are all 
books devoted to things which with Bryant were 
passions. As all students of his life well know, 
he was a devoted lover of nature, of the American 
landscape, and of flower and plant-life; he was a 
great lover of poetry; and he was a deeply relig- 
ious man. (Miss Monroe has referred pleasantly in 
one of her communications to his " pious puerili- 
ties." Bryant was not pious, he was strongly 
and reverently religious; not in a puerile but in a 
thoroughly manly and unaffected way. Of course 
this would disfranchise him as a " new " poet 
for the only religion of which so far I have found 
any traces in the " new " poetry is that of self- 
worship. Bryant conceived himself as but the 
humble vessel of a Deity Omnipotent. ) From time 
immemorial, illustrious writers have contributed 
prefaces or advised in the compilation or publica- 
tion of works upon subjects in which they were 
deeply interested; and it has remained for a 
propagandist of the " new " poetry to first come 
forward with the unique charge that Bryant in 
doing so was " false to his vision " as a poet. If 
the charge can be sustained, it occurs to me that 
we have had and still have an enormous number 
of false poets among us ! Really, one scarce knows 
which ones may with propriety be read. Perhaps 
it were best, in order to feel perfectly safe, to 
restrict ourselves to " Poetry " alone. But even 
then will we be secure from contamination ? For 
disturbing recollection ! did not " Poetry " itself 
award (Miss Monroe being the deus ex machina, I 
believe) some time ago a Cash Prize, that rarest of 



all rare birds poetically pursued, to a poet who, 
if the biographies and bibliographies are to be 
trusted, has distinguished himself by many and 
divers editorial and journalistic labors, perpetra- 
tions of prefaces, etc., etc. If one asks, Can such 
things be? I can only answer that they have been! 

The question of editorial ethics, upon which 
Miss Monroe animadverts, both directly and indi- 
rectly, may be debated to infinity without ever 
getting anywhere, for the plain reason that no gov- 
erning canon has ever been established, nor can one 
ever be. The words " edit " and " editor " are of 
an elasticity indefinable alike in latitude of inter- 
pretation and of practice. The nature, however, 
of Bryant's editorial labors upon the " Library of 
Poetry and Song " we have his own and his pub- 
lishers' statements for. No uncertainty except 
for the purpose of clouding the issue exists 
regarding them. And if the writing of an histori- 
cal Introduction extending to some 7000 words 
did not, in connection with his general editorial 
oversight, up to the time of his death, of the body 
of the work (which, as has been shown, was the 
product of various pens), qualify his name to 
appear upon the title-page of the " Popular His- 
tory of the United States " as one of its authors, 
I can imagine no " reason why " not entirely fan- 
tastical. I have been at some pains to trace out 
the " Publishers' Announcement " of this work, and 
while it is a lengthy one it nowhere indicates just 
what portions were to be contributed by Bryant 
or describes his share in the undertaking. And a 
peculiar thing remains to be noted in the prem- 
ises. This " History " was published by no less a 
house than that of Scribner the house with which 
Mr. Champlin was so long allied and of which 
Miss Monroe implies he was practically a part. 
Now, if this work was so absolute and unblushing 
a fraud as Miss Monroe asserts and re-asserts, 
how was it that Mr. Champlin could bring himself 
to remain in the employ of a firm given to such 
pernicious practices? Why did he not revolt at 
the iniquity, and affiliate himself with more hon- 
orable people? Let echo answer! 

The preface to the second volume of this work, 
as I have also previously shown, definitely stated 
that its composition had been carried on under the 
direct supervision of Bryant, and that he had 
scrutinized " every line " in the proof as well. 
But Miss Monroe alleges, on Mr. Champlin's say- 
so, that Bryant " scarcely glanced " at the proof- 
sheets. As one of the advisers of the publishers, 
one would think Mr. Champlin would have seen 
to it that the preface was altered before it went 
out into the world. Why did n't he, or else hold 
his peace thereafter? 

Speaking of proof-sheets reminds me, moreover, 
that Miss Monroe must herself be somewhat negli- 
gent in her inspection of those of the publication 
which she is believed to edit. Else how could she 
ever have " let past " that thrilling " new " poem 
in a recent issue which, as has already been pointed 
out in THE DIAL, contains a surprisingly flagrant 
plagiarism from George Meredith ? We are obliged, 
in the first place, to feel sure that Miss Monroe, as 
an experienced practitioner of the ars poetica not 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



557 



only, but one deeply versed in its representative 
exponents, must be familiar with a poem so cele- 
brated as " Lucifer in Starlight." In the second 
place, we must be not only sure, we must be 
absolutely certain " hope to die " " cross my 
heart " that so rigorous is her sense of editorial 
rectitude (as shown by her strictures upon Bryant) 
that knowing the plagiarism to be present in the 
poem (let us call it one, for did it not appear in 
" Poetry "?) she would have suspended publication 
before allowing it to appear as an original compo- 
sition. We are therefore left in an embarrassing 
dilemma,- from which we can only extricate our- 
selves by the inference that she was careless (as 
Mr. Champlin says Bryant was!) about the proof- 
sheets ! 

Yes, we feel that must be it ! For, if Miss 
Monroe had ever examined the proofs of this poem, 
must she not infallibly have forwarded them to 
the inspired (if somewhat at second-hand) author 
and requested a new, a truly " new," climacteric 
line"? Assuredly! And at the same time she must 
have pointed out how grotesque was the mar- 
shalling, as " The army of unalterable law " of 
"Matthew" (Arnold) and "Waldo" (Emerson). 
For she must be vividly aware of the fact that 
over half-a-century ago the former gave to the 
world two of the finest poems in free verse that 
any language can boast; while the tetter's entire 
influence (which was and still remains the most 
powerful ever exerted by an American writer) has 
ever been an incitement to revolt against " art 
made tongue-tied by authority," and life as well. 
I would like to add a word regarding another 
accusation against Bryant by Miss Monroe which 
she made in a previous communication to THE 
DIAL, and repeats in her latest one, that he is in 
some manner most abysmally culpable because his 
two most famous poems, " Thanatopsis " and " To 
a Waterfowl," were written, the one at the age of 
nineteen and the other at that of twenty-one, and 
he never afterward surpassed them. Poor Bryant ! 
Not only his faults (?) but his misfortunes are 
thus made to condemn him! For it is the general 
misfortune that poetical inspiration, at its highest, 
cannot be turned on and off like the stream from 
a faucet, to use the simile of George Sand re- 
garding the easy flow of her limpidly perfect prose 
and the absolute control of it that she possessed. 
As a poet himself has written : 
"Alas! not always doth the breath of song 

Breathe on us. It is like the wind that bloweth 

At its own will, not ours, nor tarrieth long; 

We hear the sound thereof, but no man knoweth 

From whence it comes, so sudden and swift and strong, 
Nor whither in its wayward course it goeth." 
If Bryant lived long thereafter and never ex- 
celled the poems of his youth, he is merely in the 
same boat with a host of other poets of renown. 
Poe, for instance, claimed to have written " To 
Helen " at the age of fourteen, and " Israfel " at 
twenty. He lived on to forty, but they remain his 
high-water mark. Rossetti composed the one poem 
with which his fame is inseparably connected, 
" The Blessed Damosel," at nineteen, and lived on 
to fifty-four. Swinburne published "Atalanta in 
alydon " and " Poems and Ballads " in his twen- 



ties, and they are the poems by which principally 
he will be remembered, though he died at seventy- 
two and his other productions fill many volumes. 
Lamartine's Meditations (which include Le Lac) 
appeared in 1820, and he continued to publish 
poetry for nearly a half-century afterward, but 
that volume is what he will live by. De Musset's 
two masterpieces, the Nuits of May and of Decem- 
ber, he wrote in 1835, at the age of twenty-five 
and failed to equal them during the twenty-two 
subsequent years of his career. So I might con- 
tinue, filling pages of THE DIAL with citations of 
names and dates, but it is, I conceive, quite un- 
necessary. To some poets it is given to write their 
most immortal verses at an early period, to others 
at a late one, to still others at an intermediate one, 
while there are some few cases in which the high- 
est point is touched or approximated at all these 
intervals. That this is or can be in any way con- 
strued as a reproach it has remained for Miss 
Monroe to assert in the case of Bryant.

ONCE IN A BLUE MOON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
If the woman of to-day, and not Henley, had 
written " Invictus," her version of the first stanza 
would have been: 

" Out of the night that covers me, 
Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be 
For my uncomfortable soul." 

Though why go afield to find the gods? Mr. H. W. 
Boynton is closer at hand. For it does n't happen 
often just once in a blue moon that anyone 
presents so penetrating a diagnosis of a case as 
his article, " Just a Nice Story," appearing in 
THE DIAL for November 25. To be sure, we had 
all known there was something wrong with our 
fiction the last century or two, but it is only 
recently that we have tried to find the cause. 
Mr. Garnett began by pointing his finger at us 
and saying, You are to blame over there in Amer- 
ica ; and Mr. Wister answered, No, not all of us 
only the critics and Harold Bell Wright. Almost 
simultaneously, Mr. Boynton and Mr. Nicholson 
stepped forward, the former making a strong 
defence of the critic, the latter declaring that there 
was almost hope for the rest of us, and both 
asserting rather triumphantly that they had never 
heard of Harold Bell Wright. Now, just as Mr. 
Henry Sydnor Harrison is ready to assure us that 
not only are matters not so dreadful as they seem 
but they are even much better than that, Mr. 
Boynton, despite his broad tolerance of what he 
calls the silly and wonderful time of youth, insists 
that things are bad after all. And whose is the 
fault? It's woman's. (Thus does history repeat 
itself.) 

And woman's soul will surely be filled with a 
divine discomfort, for she must realize that what 
he says is unequivocally and unfalteringly true. 
To begin with, she did not know any better. As 
for the last decade, or decade and a half, she has 
been so busy trying to know better that she has not 
stopped long enough to give herself time to think.

THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



She took her first plunge into literature, or 
pseudo-literature, in her early years of pig-tails 
and freckles. She was not taught, as babes are 
now, to lisp glibly, " The sea gives her shells to 
the shingle, The earth gives her streams to the 
sea " ; instead, she had to discover things for her- 
self. In a big dusty attic she pulled an old trunk 
out of its forgotten corner, and there she stum- 
bled upon her first copy of " Little Women." Not 
even in these later days, when she has specialized 
and gone in for thrills, has she found anything to 
equal that glorious moment when she gloated over 
the prospective feast in its pages, while imagina- 
tion ran riot and hope was young. She cried over 
the chapter where Beth had the scarlet fever, and 
would not read it to the end that day, thinking 
that if Beth must die she could at least postpone 
knowing about it as long as she would. Once or 
twice she did wonder if this was the kind of tale 
that grown-ups read, but when she reached the 
part where Jo married Professor Bhaer instead of 
Laurie all her doubts vanished. For she knew that 
anything so grim as that could be nothing short 
of literature. And we warn Mr. Boynton that it 
would have been a fatal hour indeed for him to 
have been on hand just then to tell her that what 
she was reading was only a sweet pretty story. 
In the trunk were old " Youth's Companions " that 
were musty and yellow and ragged. She liked 
especially the picture of the Blind Brother from 
the file of '87. The series was broken, so she 
never found out if he ever escaped from his prison 
in the mine. Another favorite was " Bet and Her 
Family " the ten commandments, poor Bet being 
the first and Ruth the eleventh and the obstreper- 
ous brothers the other nine. 

There was also a volume of Keats's poems which 
she read a year or two later. By mishap or fine 
lack of discrimination she skipped completely his 
" Ode on a Grecian Urn " and " La Belle Dame 
sans Merci," and consequently decided that on the 
whole he merely tried to soothe the cares of men 
by adjectives, ornaments, and sweets. " The Pot 
of Basil " seemed too wormy by half, and almost 
everything else of his she read she secretly thought 
was lush. But she never dreamed of confiding her 
opinions to anyone, for the school of criticism 
which dogmatically decries all poetry written 
north of 1890 (or is it 1910?) had not yet come 
into its own; or, if it had, she was young and 
innocent and did not know of it. 

It was Carlyle who did for her what poetry had 
failed to do. One day she heard some chapters 
read aloud from " Past and Present." Those 
brief snatches of cursory reading led her to think 
of him as one of the great army of hewers of 
wood and drawers of water, rather than as an 
author ; it was a pick-axe that he held in his hand, 
and his shaggy head she knew it must be 
shaggy towered godlike above his fellow- workers 
while his Blesseds and Thrice-Blesseds were heaped 
lavishly upon even a Gurth, born thrall of Cedric. 
She herself grew three inches while she listened to 
the words. Literature with power had cast its 
spell over her, and she could never be the same 
after that. She longed to read, or even write, arti- 



cles where she could say, within parentheses, " the 
italics are mine/' or use expressions like Kultur or 
elan vital. Now she was ready to sit up to the 
table with her elders, and share the game course 
and the cheese. As a sign that youth and senti- 
ment and romance were left forever behind, she 
stole up to the attic and locked the trunk and 
shoved it back against the wall of the alcove. The 
key is still on the nail in the second rafter from 
the window. It may be rusty now. 

And that brings her to the stage where she is at 
present. So much happened while she was still 
reading (dare we say it?) the Elsie Books, that she 
would never have caught up at all if she had not 
decided to jump the middle ground. Even at that 
she does n't think. There is n't time. Miss Ida 
Tarbell knows her, and in her new book, " The 
Ways of Woman," she calls her a culture-chaser. 
It is she and her sisters, according to Miss Tarbell, 
" who can be depended upon to fill a theatre at ten 
or eleven in the morning to listen to a lecture on 
Peace or the Cancer Cure, Suffrage or Tagore, 
Radium or the Panama Canal. It is they who are 
the instant ally of any cause which is new and it 
is they who will stay by as long as the campaign 
is exciting or until something more exciting 
looms in sight." Mr. Galsworthy must have met 
her last year, for, even far more effectively, he 
describes her thus : " There was in her blood that 
which bade her hasten, lest there should be some- 
thing still new to her when she died. . . What with 
travelling in new countries, listening to new 
preachers, lunching new novelists, discovering new 
dancers, taking lessons in Spanish; what with 
new dishes for dinner, new religions, new dogs, 
new dresses, new duties to new neighbours, and 
newer charities life was so full that the moment 
it stood still and was simply old ' life,' it seemed 
to be no life at all." And in writing of her, no 
doubt Mr. Galsworthy and Miss Tarbell, like Mr. 
Boynton, had in mind all ladylike gentlemen as 
well. 

Perhaps some day she will tire of looking at 
things as they are, just as she tired of looking at 
them as they are not. Perhaps some day she will 
crawl under Mr. Boynton's barbed-wire fence and 
discover the world of true idealism and know " the 
stuff of which manly life and manly imagination 
are made." Perhaps she will want to come back 
to hear more about things as they were. Think 
of the transformation there will be, as a result, in 
fiction and literature and life! But why be opti- 
mistic about it? Things like that seldom happen 
out of books only once in a blue moon.

MORE ABOUT DIPHTHONGS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Will you permit me to say, in reply to your cor- 
respondent, Mr. Wallace Rice, that the remarks 
which he quotes from my " Essentials of English 
Speech and Literature " were written to bring out 
the fact that, in the view of the National Education 
Association's Committee on Phonetics, the diph- 
thongal characters of the digraphs ch, ng, sh, th, 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



559 



and zh, would be better indicated by ligatured sym- 
bols than by the plain letters. 

Mr. Rice asks : " What can Dr. Vizetelly mean 
when he calls sh, ng, th, and zh diphthongal? . . 
The four sounds mentioned (really five, since th 
stands for two different consonants) are monoph- 
thongs." 

Perhaps Mr. Rice has overlooked the fact that 
one of the meanings of the word " diphthong " is a 
combination of two consonants in one syllable, espe- 
cially such intimate unions as those of ch and dg or 
j (dz), in " church," " judge," etc. And as for 
calling the symbols monophthongs, has not Mr. 
Rice forgotten that a monophthong is a single 
vowel sound, a vowel digraph, or two written 
vowels pronounced as one ? As this is the meaning 
which the word has had for nearly three centuries, 
it would ill befit me to misuse it as Mr. Rice has 
done. 

Mr. Rice asks what can I mean when I call the 
symbols referred to diphthongal. He will find the 
answer in a standard work issued under the editor- 
ship of the late Dr. William T. Harris : 

" CH. This digraph has three sounds as follows: 
(1) The more frequent sound is diphthongal . . as in 
chin." 

" NG. The ng at the end of a word is really diph- 
thongal." 

" SH. The description by Briicke seems more accu- 
rate, which makes it to be a composite element, con- 
sisting of an s sound . . and a breath sound . . like the 
German ch in ich." 

" TH. This digraph is used to represent two lingua- 
dental fricative sounds: a surd and a sonant." 

" ZH. In some words, z takes a sound (zh) which 
is the sopant correlative of the surd sh; as in azure . . 
developed "by 'fusion of a proper z with a following y 
sound." 

In addition to this, the work referred to, before 
discussing these symbols, which it classifies as 
" Diphthongal Consonants," says : " Certain con- 
sonant sounds are composed of more simple con- 
sonant elements so blended that the product is 
property described as diphthongal." 

No one regrets more than I that Mr. Rice disa- 
grees with me that is his privilege, and far be it 
from me not to wish him all the comfort and satis- 
faction that he may get out of it. 

FRANK H. VIZETELLY. 

New York City, Nov. 26, 1915. 



(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
After stating that " every one of the great dic- 
tionaries has decided that the sound of these letters 
[ng, sh, the two sounds of th, and zh] is diph- 
thongal," it is interesting to find Dr. Vizetelly 
mentioning as sole authority for his statement a 
book which remains anonymous, except for the 
fact that it is " a standard work issued under the 
editorship of the late Dr. William T. Harris." who 
was not a phonetician. Since his declaration was 
a portion of a passionate apology for the Scientific 
Alphabet of the National Educational Association, 
and the Standard Dictionary is not only the chief 
exponent of the use of that signary in English but 
also a lexicon with which Dr. Vizetelly was inti- 
mately connected, it would have been natural to 



find him turning first of all to the official exposi- 
tion of that alphabet on pages 2195-2197 of this 
important work. 

I turned to these pages, and the reason was 
immediately evident why the good Doctor pre- 
ferred to quote from other sources. Here, where 
the inventors and demonstrators of the Scientific 
Alphabet are engaged in its official exposition, one 
may find it said of ng, " the elementary palatal 
nasal sound in sing, sang, sung "; of sh, " the ele- 
mentary sound closing in rush, opening in she"; 
of the sonant sound of th, " the elementary sound 
of th in that " ; of the surd sound of th, " the ele- 
mentary sound closing in myth, pith, opening in 
thin, think "; of zh, " the elementary sonant cor- 
responding with sh." In other words, the highest 
exponents of the characteristics of the alphabet 
upon which Dr. Vizetelly is expatiating contradict 
him absolutely on every point of his contention. 
But why did he not take their word for it? They 
know. 

But I was at a loss to understand why, when I 
had said in my original communication that ch is 
usually a consonantal diphthong, Dr. Vizetelly 
should have felt it necessary to quote further 
authority upon it, until I realized that it was for 
the purpose of self-refutation; of course, if, as he 
says in his book, " most phonetists analyze this 
sound as a combination of t and sh," sh must 
itself be a simple sound had it diphthongal 
quality a consonantal triphthong would result. 
The quotation citing Briicke is quite beside the 
question ; as " a standard work issued under the 
editorship of the late Dr. William T. Harris," - 
Webster's New International Dictionary, ob- 
serves, " it is regarded as a simple element," nor 
does it require much phonetic knowledge to know 
that composite consonants and consonantal diph- 
thongs are not the same things, as where the 
authority just quoted states of ng, " the sound is 
composite, but not compound." On page xlvi of 
the same work may be found the statement: "A 
consonantal digraph is a combination of two con- 
sonants representing a single sound, as sh in she, 
zh in azure, ng in sing," while the New English 
Dictionary (Vol. VIII, p. i) speaks of " the simple 
consonants, sh, zh." 

Where Dr. Vizetelly obtained his remarkable 
statement that " the ng at the end of a word is 
really diphthongal," I cannot surmise, and I should 
like to have the citation in full. The practically 
unanimous opinion of phonetic scholars is set 
forth in the Century Dictionary (p. 2423) thus: 
" With the digraph ng is written the nasal which 
corresponds to g and k in the same manner as 
n to d and t, or m to b and p, and which (for 
example, in singing) is just as much a simple 
sound as n or m." See, too, p. xlii of the New 
International, in which m, n, and ng ,are treated 
as similarly simple sounds; p. Hi of the same, 
where it says, " The digraph ng represents a nasal 
consonant sound," Vol. VI, part 2, p. 1, of the 
New English Dictionary, "Before the sounds (g) 
and (k) the letter n is also employed in English to 
denote a nasal with back tongue closure," or the 
article on Phonetics by Mr. Henry Sweet, in the

THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



Encyclopaedia Britanniea, Vol. XXI, p. 467, or 
Alexander J. Ellis's "The History of English 
Speech," or Mr. Sweet's " History of English 
Sounds," or Dr. Alexander Melville Bell's " Prin- 
ciples of Speech," p. 230, where ng is character- 
ized as " this simple elementary sound." It is 
perhaps permissible here to say that ng was 
recognized as a simple sound by our Teutonic 
ancestors several centuries before Christ, and a 
rune provided for it. 

It is rather pitiful to find Dr. Vizetelly quoting 
in support of his position such a statement as 
that the digraph TH " is used to represent two 
lingua-dental fricative sounds: a surd and a 
sonant," and italicizing words to mislead his read- 
ers further ; it is as if he had said, " John anr 1 
William are individuals," and concluded, " there- 
fore each is twins." The Century Dictionary 
sums up the uniform consensus of opinion when 
it says on p. 6145 : " With li, t forms the digraph 
th, which has the position and importance of a 
fully independent element in the alphabet, with a 
double pronunciation surd and sonant (or breathed 
and voiced) : surd in thin, breath; sonant in this, 
breathe both as strictly unitary sounds as t and 
d>, or s and z." The New English Dictionary, 
Vol. IX, p. 241, notes that " Th . . is a conso- 
nantal digraph representing a simple sound, or 
rather . . a pair of simple sounds, breath and 
voice/' and in Vol. X, p. 1, " Ih is a consonantal 
digraph representing two simple sounds." These 
two simple sounds, it may be added, were recog- 
nized as such by the Anglo-Saxons, who gave them 
separate letters in their alphabet, which persisted 
until the Norman Conquest. 

The quotation regarding zh is also beside the 
question. Dr. Vizetelly chooses to be unaware 
that sounds developed by fusion may nevertheless 
be simple sounds, though nothing is more common 
in phonetic history. Instances in English abound, 
and in nearly all other languages which have 
engaged the attention of scholars. Of the sound 
in question it may be sufficient to quote the Cen- 
tury Dictionary again, which says : " SH. A 
digraph representing a simple sibilant sound akin 
to s. . . ZH. The corresponding sonant to our 
other sibilant (written in this work with zh, after 
the example of sh)"; or the New English Diction- 
ary, which says : " The simple consonants, sh, 
zh " ; or the New International, where we find 
" sh is reckoned as a simple consonant; zh is the 
voiced correlative of sh " ; or Dr. Bell, who speaks 
of sh as " this element " and of zh as " this ele- 
ment " (pp. 215, 220) ; and the Standard Diction- 
ary as cited heretofore. 

Dr. Vizetelly seems not to appreciate the deli- 
cate compliment I paid him in the use of the 
word monophthong, by folloAving his use of the 
word diphthong in speaking of consonants. He 
has done me the honor to look the former up in 
the dictionary; if he will do himself the justice 
of also looking up the latter he will promptly 
withdraw his statement that " one of the meanings 
of the word ' diphthong ' is a combination of two 
consonants in one syllable " at least, no such 
meaning attaches to the word in the New English, 



the New International, the Century, the Standard, 
the Concise Oxford, the Imperial, Stormonth's, or 
Worcester's Dictionary, which are all I have had 
time to consult. 

Finally permit me to observe that if Dr. Vize- 
telly will acquaint himself with the earlier para- 
graphs of "A Primer of English Sounds," by Mr. 
Henry Sweet, most eminent of living phoneticians 
in English, he can by personal experimentation 
with his own vocal organs satisfy himself that the 
five sounds under discussion are all simple con- 
sonantal sounds ; I did, forty -five years ago.

IMAGISM AND PLAGIAEISM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Surely you do not mean to accuse Mr. T. S. 
Eliot of trying to " put something over " when, in 
your issue of November 25, you use the unfortu- 
nate word " plagiarism " in connection with your 
discussion of his recent contribution to " Poetry." 
I read the poem in question when it appeared; 
and, in common with you, I recognized the line, 
" The army of unalterable law," as the last line 
of Meredith's " Lucifer " sonnet. It seemed to 
me then, and seems to me now, a rather neat trans- 
position. The' thought never entered my naive 
brain that Mr. Eliot (who is, by the way, entirely 
unknown to me personally) could have supposed 
that the line would be regarded as anything but a 
quotation. I could as easily fancy a man trying 
to palm off as his own such phrases as " justify 
the ways of God to men," " I shall not look upon 
his like again," or " To be, or not to he : that 
is the question." Plagiarism is the corrupt at- 
tempt to pass off as one's own the work of another 
writer; there is no possible relation between it 
and Mr. Eliot's employment of a great and world- 
famous phrase in a position where the reader's 
recognition of it as a quotation is precisely the 
effect aimed at. 

Genuine plagiarism is a rare vice; it generally 
occurs in regions where the reward for successful 
stealing is considerably higher than any reward 
that the poet is likely to get. 

ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE. 

Davenport, Iowa, Dec. 1, 1915. 

[It has always been an elementary law of 
literary ethics that quotations must be enclosed 
in quotation marks, or otherwise plainly ac- 
knowledged ; and the writer who fails to con- 
form to this law cannot justly escape the 
charge of plagiarism. Of course exception is 
commonly made in the case of such phrases as 
those mentioned by Mr. Ficke, which have 
become counters of our literary currency, 
worn thin by universal daily use. That Mere- 
dith's line is not of this class is sufficiently 
proved, if proof were needed, by the fact that 
it does not even appear among the ten or 
fifteen thousand "familiar quotations" com- 
prised in the latest (1914) edition of Bartlett's 
standard reference book. EDITOR.]

VIEWS OF STEVENSOX.* 

It has been lately held by some writers that 
interest in Stevenson is waning. The number 
of books and articles relating to him still 
constantly issuing from the press, however, 
seems to indicate that the reverse is true. In 
addition to the volumes named below, another 
biography of Stevenson for the young and a 
reprint of Mr. Clayton Hamilton's articles 
on Stevensonian localities from " The Book- 
man " are among the recent announcements. 
All of these together lead us to infer the wide 
range of readers who continue to find enter- 
tainment in Stevenson's works. 

To genuine lovers of Stevenson, Mr. 
Frank Swinnerton's well written book will 
come as a great shock. It seems that their 
faith has been misplaced, that Stevenson 
was not, after all, what they took him to be. 
Mr. Swinnerton's opinion is disparaging at 
almost every point. According to him, Steven- 
son's only enduring book of travel is " In the 
South Seas " ; his essays are merely specimens 
of style, with finesse but without vigor ; his 
poems will not endure because they are lack- 
ing in passion ; his plays are shallow, " it 
never occurred to him to put a real figure in 
a play : he never supposed that a character 
in a play had any end but to be put back 
into the box with the other playthings"; of 
his short stories only five are really artistic; 
of his novels and romances only " Treasure 
Island " and " Kidnapped " are worth while. 
To so little do the thirty-two volumes of the 
collected works (as arranged in the "Bio- 
graphical Edition") come when Stevenson's 
work is sifted by the coldly critical Mr. 
Swinnerton ! 

As for the rest, our critic gives Stevenson 
credit " for most admirable clarity " ; his 
romances " include occasional pieces of distin- 
guished imagination, a frequent exuberance 
of fancy, and a great freshness of incident 
which conceals lack of central or unifying 
idea and poverty of imagined character." He 
has great versatility of talent, and one can- 
not contemplate the record of his writings 
" without great admiration." That is all. He 
was a Scot and an invalid. The first misfor-

tune left him without the capacity for emotion 
required of the poet (p. 92). The other 
caused him to lack the real courage needed 
for great adventures in literature as in life : 
" with all his writing he took the road of least 
resistance, the road of limited horizons; be- 
cause with all his desire for romance, his 
desire for the splendour of the great life of 
action, he was by physical delicacy made 
intellectually timid and spiritually cautious." 

This, then, is the theory we are asked to 
accept with regard to one whom we had been 
accustomed to think of as having earned his 
niche, though not a lofty one, in the temple 
of fame. Is it true? Is oblivion for Steven- 
son, after all, inevitable? "Was so much of 
his work, after all, mere craftsmanship? To 
answer these questions fully would perhaps 
require a volume ; here we can only set down 
our dissenting opinion. 

It seems to us that this book well illus- 
trates Arnold's remark that the critic requires 
a very delicate poise. The least obstruction 
between him and his object may tend to throw 
him out of balance and distort his view of 
distant objects, as in Poe's story of "The 
Sphinx." We do not question Mr. Swinner- 
ton's full knowledge of Stevenson's works ; we 
do question, however, his attitude of mind 
toward his author. He finds Stevenson tire- 
some, and that very fact arouses suspicion as 
to his temperamental qualifications for this 
particular task. When one is tempted to 
write a book upon a tiresome writer, one 
should perhaps stop and consider if one be 
"called." That Mr. Swinnerton was not 
called is amply demonstrated, it seems to us, 
by his last paragraph. 

One thing would seem certain : if there be 
so little art in Stevenson's work, if he be so 
entirely a decadent, if the unspeakable and 
canny Scot and the timid invalid have so 
completely dominated his work, then he is 
bound very quickly to disappear from the 
horizon. For we can never get away from 
the fundamental canon that art is social: it 
takes two to paint a picture, the artist and 
his observer ; two to make a book, the author 
and his reader; two to fashion a statue, the 
sculptor and he who will behold with sympa- 
thetic insight; and though the artist may be 
unconscious of it, the critic is present before 
and during, as well as after, the execution of 
the work. We may be fearful 6f Demos' 
qualifications for anything else than a place 
in a mob; but in the end it is Demos (at his 
best, of course) who rules us all. And after 
all, has not Demos given us (or restored to 
us) Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and Scott, and 
Thackeray, and many another? There are 



562

imperfections in the work of all of these ; yet 
in spite of their imperfections they survive 
and continue to give us refreshment and even 
inspiration. They are men like ourselves; 
they were not always at their best ; they grew 
as we all grow. Time has sifted their work: 
the less valuable part, though still included in 
complete editions, is no longer known to the 
great body of readers ; but the best is every- 
where known and read and loved. So it will 
be with Stevenson ; and may it not be that a 
somewhat larger body of his writing will 
endure than five short stories and two boys' 
books? We can only record our confident 
belief that such will be the case. A century 
from now some curious antiquarian may smile 
at these lines and wonder who Stevenson was. 
If so, he is welcome; it will not be the first 
time a prophet has gone astray. 

The characteristics of Stevenson's essays, 
Mr. Swinnerton finds, are those "of manner 
rather than of matter." They " owe their 
charm to the fact that Stevenson was often 
writing about himself, for he always wrote en- 
tertainingly about himself. He was charmed 
by himself, in a way that the common egoist 
has not the courage or possibly the imagina- 
tion to be." Yet where will one find a super- 
abundance of the author's self in "Pulvis et 
Umbra," in "Talk and Talkers," in "Beg- 
gars," in "JEs Triplex"? In these essays, at 
least, Stevenson rarely talks about himself. 
Is it true that these essays give pleasure 
merely because of their " knots," as Mr. Swin- 
nerton implies, or merely because they are 
full of a commonplace moralizing which is 
received with delight by the bulk of us com- 
monplace readers? We must confess to hon- 
est doubts. We do not insist that an essayist's 
every idea shall be absolutely new or original ; 
we do insist that he shall express it in a fresh 
and stimulating manner, and that he shall be 
neither prosy nor narrow in his sympathies. 
And Stevenson generally meets these require- 
ments. 

The poems Mr. Swinnerton pronounces to 
be failures because they were the work of a 
Protestant Scot. This would also prove Burns 
a failure. Surely, however, Stevenson was not 
invariably the cautious, canny, theologizing 
Scot. As a matter of fact, with the possible 
exception of " Our Lady of the Snows," the 
poems reveal no traces of Protestant any 
more than of Catholic " theology " ; and ex- 
cept for the second book of "Underwoods" 
and a few Scotticisms here and there in his 
other verse, they might have been written by 
an Englishman or an Irishman. In certain 
respects we should pronounce many of them 
distinctly successful. They are not long and 



ambitious; they never attempt too much; 
and they easily and naturally portray many 
various moods. That Stevenson was not a 
great poet may be freely granted ; yet he had 
the soul of a poet ; he has enshrined the child 
heart in verse which will live, we believe, for 
generations; throughout even his prose will 
be found beautiful poetical passages, as for 
example where Kirstie says to Archie Weir: 

" Weel, Mr. Archie, there was a lad cam r 
courtin' me, as was but naetural. Mony had come 
before, and I would nane o' them. But this yin 
had a tongue to wile the birds frae the lift and the 
bees frae the fox-glove bells. Deary me, but it's 
lang syne. Folk have deed sinsyne and been bur- 
ied, and are forgotten, and bairns been horn and 
got merrit and got bairns o' their ain. Sinsyne 
woods have been plantit, and have grawn up and 
are bonny trees, and the joes sit in their shadow,, 
and sinsyne auld estates have changed hands, and 
there have been wars and rumours of wars on the 
face of the earth. . . And do ye no think that I 
have mind of the bonny simmer days, the lang 
miles, o' the bluid-red heather, the cryin' o' the 
whaups, and the lad and the lassie that was 
trysted? Do ye no think that I mind how the 
hilly sweetness ran about my hairt?" 

That Stevenson was not a dramatist we are 
also quite willing to concede. While he had a 
superb command of conversational style, he 
was most at home in more leisurely narrative 
of the third person, in which he could intro- 
duce description when it pleased him. But 
surely he and Henley were on the wrong 
track. It is not fair, of course, to impute to 
him either faults or merits for which Henley 
may have been partly responsible. We can 
only say that the plays do not convince us. 
The two phases of " Deacon Brodie " are not 
sufficiently distinguished: and while the vil- 
lain of the play could hardly be hanged on 
the stage (it will be remembered that the real 
Brodie was hanged), yet the manner of his 
taking off comes as an unwarranted surprise. 
Beau Austin is too quickly convinced of the 
errors of his ways to seem wholly natural. 
"Admiral Guinea " is too pious ; the one excel- 
lent character in this play is the villainous 
Pew. Sir Arthur Pinero, in his address on 
Stevenson's dramatic work, has probably said 
the last word on this phase of the matter. 

Of the short stories, there are doubtless 
many opinions as to which are the best. Mr. 
Swinnerton thinks that " The Bottle Imp "" 
and " Thrawn Janet " are " the two most suc- 
cessful examples of Stevenson's art as a short- 
story writer " ; and with this view we have no 
special quarrel. As for the others, to our 
mind Mr. Swinnerton does not do justice 
either to " The Sire de Maletroit's Door " or 
to "A Lodging for the Night." The former 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



563 



seems to us the better, because fuller of inci- 
dent and more climactic. Yet the latter, far 
from being " a piece of labored artifice," is to 
us true and convincing. Perhaps Mr. Swin- 
nerton fails most conspicuously in his treat- 
ment of "The Pavilion on the Links," which 
he thinks Stevenson did not first imagine, but 
planned in cold blood. " If I look for emo- 
tion in the story," he says, " I find none. If I 
look for an aesthetic idea I find none." Can 
it be that he is incapable of perceiving either? 
For both are there. Every one of the chief 
characters is full of emotional stimulus; one 
might almost say, even, that every character 
furnishes an aesthetic idea. " The Beach of 
Falesa " is likewise a captivating tale. The 
author has admirably succeeded in the imper- 
sonation of his hero; the form seems to us 
well adapted to the content ; and not without 
reason have some called this story his best. 

With regard to the novels and romances, 
Mr. Swinnerton's complaint is that Steven- 
son's constructive power weakens. This can 
hardly be said, however, of " Prince Otto," in 
which there is no flaw. There is plenty of 
incident; the unexpected is constantly hap- 
pening; and the characters are sufficiently 
well motivated to pass muster. Our critic 
thinks the theme too slight; we should be 
inclined to say that the result proves that it 
is not. The theme is adequate. To call it a 
" doleful failure " and a " lackadaisical gim- 
crack " is to put oneself outside the pale of 
serious criticism. 

" The Master of Ballantrae," which has 
been pronounced by not a few to be among 
Stevenson's best, Mr. Swinnerton, on the 
whole, condemns. How the introduction of 
Secundra Dass "ruins the book as a work of 
art," however, passes our comprehension. 
Secundra is obviously essential for the work- 
ing out of the plot, and moreover himself adds 
legitimately to the interest by the mystery 
which he brings to the story. The critic fur- 
ther objects to the rambling course of the 
story, " its wilful attempts to follow the wan- 
derings of a central figure so fascinating . . 
as the Master, its lack of framework and true 
body of character"; he finds Lord Durris- 
deer and Alison "truly no more than pup- 
pets," while " even the Master sometimes is 
no more than a collection of traits." As for 
the first point, we had supposed that, given a 
plot of this sort, the central figure of which 
wanders over the world, Stevenson introduced 
proper devices for enabling us to follow him. 
As for the other too sweeping criticisms, we 
can only express dissent. No puppet could 
fight such a duel as Henry fights ; the fault is 
that at the end he plays too minor a part. 



Mr. Swinnerton comes nearer to doing jus- 
tice to "Weir of Hermiston," in which he 
rightly thinks that " Stevenson reached the 
height of his powers as a realistic novelist." 
Nor does he need to except from his praise 
Frank Innes, "the novelists' hireling profes- 
sional seducer." The mere fact that such 
characters occur elsewhere should not prevent 
us from recognizing the naturalness of Innes. 
True, "continuity of narrative there is none" ; 
but is there much more in "Adam Bede " 
or " Henry Esmond " ? The outline of the 
projected conclusion, however terrifying to 
Mr. Swinnerton, would seem to \varrant the 
opinion that had Stevenson finished the story, 
probably in a somewhat modified form, it 
would have taken rank among the few great, 
novels of the nineteenth century. 

In short, Mr. Swinnerton's book is to a 
considerable degree disappointing. It pre- 
sents the extreme views of a hostile critic, 
which are quite as wide of the mark, it seems 
to us, as was the indiscriminate praise we 
used to hear. 

Mr. Balfour's life of Stevenson, issued in 
1901, and reviewed in THE DIAL for Nov. 16 
of that year, has now been republished in an 
abridged form. The 548 pages of the original 
two-volume edition have been cut down to 
372, partly by omitting foot-notes, appen- 
dices, the South Sea map, and the index, 
partly by a skilful cutting down of the text. 
The only important addition we have noted in 
the text is a paragraph at the end of Chapter 
VI, in which the author refers to the fact 
that Stevenson's canoe trip in 1876 lay 
through scenes now memorable for the battles 
lately fought there, and quotes Stevenson's 
remark that Landrecies "was a point in the 
great warfaring system of Europe, and might 
on some future day be ringed about with 
cannon smoke and thunder, and make itself a 
name among small towns." The chief addi- 
tions, however, are the thirteen illustrations, 
all of which are new. To what w r as said of 
the former edition little need now be added. 
The book has worn well, and has taken its 
place among the worthiest biographies of the 
last two decades. 

Miss Amy Cruse's biography is included 
in the series of " Heroes of All Time " ; here 
Stevenson rubs elbows with Alexander, King 
Alfred, Joan of Arc, Mohammed, Sir Walter 
Raleigh, and William the Silent. That 
Stevenson was a brave man and a hero, none 
will deny ; but that he deserves such distinc- 
tion as this is perhaps more than most even 
of his ardent admirers would claim for him. 
The book is especially written for the young, 



564

and on the whole not badly written. It is 
well illustrated. On p. 60, "Leslie Stevenson" 
should be Leslie Stephen. 

Some interesting views of Stevenson are 
given in "Sailor and Beachcomber," from 
the pen of Mr. A. Safroni-Middleton. It is a 
curious book, abounding- in ungrammatical ex- 
pressions and with an occasional misspelling; 
yet the author has the poet's eye, and despite 
the hardships through which he has passed, 
has never lost the feeling for nature pos- 
sessed by the true seer. At fourteen he ran 
away from home and shipped before the mast 
for Australia. Thence, after various adven- 
tures, he drifted to Samoa. His skill witii 
the violin gave him unusual opportunities to 
see all kinds of life. When he first met 
Stevenson, the latter was deeply interested in 
birds' eggs. "He had intellectual keen eyes 
and a sad emotional-looking face, and looked 
a bit of a dreamer." Later, on shipboard, 
Middleton taught Stevenson something of 
violin-playing. Perhaps the most interesting 
glimpse we get of Stevenson is at the bedside 
of a little ill Samoan girl ; he " tenderly bent 
over the little patient, as concerned as though 
it were his own child, as he chuckled with his 
lips, and touched it softly on the chin with 
his finger playfully, till it actually looked up 
at him and gave a wan smile." No wonder 
Tusitala was venerated. Mr. Middleton 's 
account of the missionaries, we regret to say, 
is sadly at variance with the views of them 
expressed by Stevenson himself ; yet the later 
writer gives the impression of trying to be 
fair, and expressly admits that " some of the 
best men are missionaries and sacrifice years 
of their lives in a hopeless quest."

CLASSICS ON THE ART or ACTING.* 

Of the four booklets on play making edited 
and published by Professor Brander Matthews 
for the Dramatic Museum of Columbia Uni- 
versity, it was said in THE DIAL (March 4, 
1915) that "here is both solid shot and canis- 
ter with which to rout the ardent enthusiasts 
whose self-imposed task is to 'uplift' the 
drama." With equal truth it may be said of 
the four illuminating papers on acting w r hich 
constitute the second series of the publications 

* PAPERS ON ACTING. Comprising : The Illusion of the 
First Time in Acting, by William Gillette, with introduction 
by George Arliss ; Art and the Actor, by Constant Coquelin, 
translated by Abby Langdon Alger, with introduction by 
Henry James ; Mrs. Siddons as Lady Macbeth and as Queen 
Katharine, by H. C. Fleeming Jenkin, with introduction by 
Brander Matthews ; Reflexions on Acting, by Talma, with 
introduction by Sir Henry Irving, and a review by H. C. 
Fleeming Jenkin. New York City: Dramatic Museum of 
Columbia University. 



issued by Professor Matthews in the name of 
the museum of which he is both creator and 
suzerain, that here is shot with which to anni- 
hilate the amateur actor. However, since 
only three hundred and thirty-three copies of 
these booklets are printed, it is doubtful if 
either the " uplifters " or the amateur actors 
ever place themselves within range of the 
sound common sense regarding both play writ- 
ing and play acting which is here presented. 

The " papers on acting " comprising the 
new series of these publications are written 
with a single exception by notable actors. 
The exception is the paper on Mrs. Siddons 
by H. C. Fleeming Jenkin. Although it suf- 
fers by comparison w T ith its fellows, it never- 
theless contains the surprising statement that 
an actor must be a creator rather than an 
interpreter, the humble author of the play 
doing less for the actor than nature for the 
painter. This is certainly the apotheosis of 
the art of acting. Lest the vanity of the 
actor who may chance to read these words 
become even more inordinate than is its wont, 
it is well to administer as an antidote the 
following quotation from Mr. George Moore Vs 
scintillating essay on "Mummer Worship" 
published some twenty-five years ago in a 
volume entitled " Impressions and Opinions " : 

" An actor is one who repeats a portion of a 
story invented by another. You can teach a child 
to act, but you can teach no child to paint pic- 
tures, or to write poetry, prose or music; acting 
is therefore the lowest of the arts, if it is an art at 
all, and makes slender demands upon the intelli- 
gence of the individual exercising it; but this age, 
being one mainly concerned with facile amusement 
and parade, reverences the actor above all beings, 
and has by some prodigy that cannot be explained 
by us, succeeded, or almost succeeded in abstracting 
him from the playwright, upon whom he should 
feed in the manner of a parasite, and endowing him 
with a separate existence of necessity ephem- 
eral, but which by dint of gaudy upholstery and 
various millinery has been prolonged beyond due 
limits and still continues." 

There is more truth in Mr. Moore's ani- 
madversion than in Mr. Fleeming Jenkin's 
eulogium. Children do act tolerably well, and 
acting does make slender demands upon the 
intelligence in comparison with the other arts. 
Not only do children act tolerably well, but 
also some amateurs; yet where is the ama- 
teur, unprepared for his task by years of 
preparation, who paints, carves statues, com- 
poses music, or even writes tolerably well? 
Mozart and Mendelssohn composed in child- 
hood, it is true, but modern children cannot 
do any of these things acceptably; hence it 
is easy to accept Mr. Moore's contention that 
acting is a knack rather than an art. Mr.

Moore is a literary man, however, and jealous 
of the adulation bestowed upon the actor. 
Like most literary men, he feels that after all 
the play is the thing, and that the actor, with 
the help of his salaried press-agent, gobbles 
more than his share of the public's approval. 
But the actor has a distinct advantage in that 
he makes a personal and nightly bid for favor, 
whereas his rival may appear trembling and 
halting for a moment only in answer to cries 
for the author uttered at a single perform- 
ance. Seeing an actor in a part, the public 
thinks of him as constituting the part; yet 
without the words someone else has written, 
there would be no part at all. Thus the actor 
receives the lion's share of the applause ; and 
because the public knows and loves him, his 
name appears on the playbills in letters ten 
times as large as those which herald the name 
of the poor author. 

Acting is an art, however, although like 
singing and playing an instrument it is in- 
terpretive, not creative, and therefore on a 
lower plane than painting, sculpture, creative 
writing, and the composition of music. In 
order to discover the true relation of acting 
to play writing, it is necessary to accept the 
testimony of an unbiased witness. This is to 
be found in the paper entitled, " The Illusion 
of the First Time in Acting," contributed by 
Mr. William Gillette. The most entertaining, 
l>y far, of the four papers which constitute 
the series, it is at the same time the most 
illuminating; for although it sparkles with 
humor, it is replete with common sense, and 
free from the grandiose acclaim of acting 
found in the late Constant Coquelin's "Art 
and the Actor." 

The " illusion " which forms the subject of 
Mr. Gillette's paper he explains as the art of 
knowing exactly what you are going to say 
and behaving as though you did not. "Al- 
though," as he states, " every single item in a 
play from the most important to the least 
important be successfully safeguarded, there 
yet remains the Spirit of the Presentation as 
a whole. Each successive audience before 
which it is given must feel that it is wit- 
nessing, not one of a thousand weary repeti- 
tions, but a life episode which is being lived 
just across the magic barrier of the footlights. 
That is to say, the Whole must have that 
indescribable Life-Spirit or Effect which pro- 
duces the Illusion of Happening for the First 
Time." 

It is the creation of this illusion of the first 
time, the imbuing of a play with " that inde- 
scribable Life-Spirit," which makes acting a 
fine art. Yet this is no answer to the late 
Mr. Fleeming Jenkin's appalling contention 



that the actor is the creator, and the author a 
mere element of less value to him than nature 
to the painter. Unless the ether ealizing ap- 
plause which he has received as an actor has 
anaesthetized his literary sense, Mr. Gillette 
notable both as actor and playwright is in 
a position to judge impartially the relative 
importance of the actor and the dramatist. 
These are his views : 

" Incredible as it may seem, there are people in 
existence who believe that they can read a Play. . . 
The feat is impossible. No one on earth can read 
a Play. You may read the Directions for a Play 
and from these Directions imagine as best you can 
what the Play would be like; but you could no 
more read the Play than you could read a Fire or 
an Automobile Accident or a Base-Ball Game. 
The Play if it is Drama does not exist until 
it appeals in the form of simulated life. . . So far 
as painted, manufactured, and mechanical elements 
are concerned there is comparatively little trouble. 
To keep these things as much in the background as 
they would appear in a simple episode in actual 
life under observation and no more is the 
most pronounced difficulty. But when it comes to 
the Human Beings required to assume the Char- 
acters which the Directions indicate, and not only 
to assume them but also to breathe into them the 
Breath of Life and not the Breath of Life alone 
but all other details a.nd elements and items of Life 
as far as they can be simulated, many and serious 
discouragements arise." 

This view makes of the dramatist something 
more than an element, since it at least credits 
him with inventing the directions from which 
a play is created. Moreover, a third factor 
is admitted by Mr. Gillette to exist in the 
shape of the manager, who selects and guides 
the human beings required to assume the 
characters which the directions indicate. 

Another element in the making of a play 
is the audience, which Mr. George Arliss, in 
his delightful Introduction to Mr. Gillette's 
paper, calls the " great stimulant." Without an 
audience to view it, the author, the manager, 
and the actors are still obliged to imagine as 
best they can what the play will be like. It 
is the author, however, in spite of all the con- 
tentions actors may make to the contrary, who 
conceives the play, and by his directions indi- 
cates the way in which it shall be interpreted. 
Moreover, good acting cannot redeem a bad 
play, and bad acting cannot wholly destroy 
the dramatic power of a good play. If a play 
is truly dramatic, its performance by a com- 
pany of tyros will hold an audience, and if it 
is undramatic even an " all star " cast will not 
prevent it from boring those who witness it. 
The author, therefore, is surely the creator, 
the actors being merely the interpreters. 

" It is easier to detect a flaw in the actor's 
impersonation," the late Sir Henry Irving 



566 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



maintains in his Introduction to Talma's 
"Reflexions on Acting," "than an improba- 
bility in a book." If the noted English his- 
trion means to suggest that an audience will 
accept improbability in a story, provided the 
story holds its interest, his statement is true, 
dulness being the one flaw in a play an audi- 
ence will not tolerate. The true relation of 
the actor to the author is best set forth, how- 
ever, by Talma. "Associated with great 
authors," he says, "actors are to them more 
than translators. A translator adds nothing 
to the ideas of the author he translates. The 
actor, putting himself faithfully in the place 
of the personage he represents, should perfect 
the ideas of the author of whom he is the 
interpreter." The italics are not Talma's. 
They are intended to accentuate the fine dis- 
tinction he draws between the translator and 
the interpreter. The one merely conveys a 
meaning, while the other explains and ex- 
pounds it. 

Whether an actor should experience emotion 
while acting or merely present his studied 
impressions is a question answered differently 
by actors differing temperamentally. "An 
actor needs not to be actually moved," says 
the late Constant Coquelin. "It is as un- 
necessary as it is for a pianist to be in the 
depths of despair to play the funeral march 
of Chopin or of Beethoven aright." A con- 
trary view is held by the great Talma. " The 
inspired actor," he holds, "will so associate 
you with the emotions he feels that he will 
not leave you even the liberty of judgment; 
the other, by his prudent and irreproachable 
acting, will leave your faculties at liberty to 
reason on the matter at your ease. The 
former will be the personage himself, the lat- 
ter only an actor who represents that per- 
sonage." In a word, the one interprets, the 
other merely translates. 

Talma upholds the emotional rather than 
the intellectual actor. Yet all inspired artists, 
whether they be painters, musicians, authors, 
or actors, possess the " extreme sensibility " 
he prefers to "profound intelligence." In- 
deed, it is the various means used by artists 
to express their emotions which differentiate 
one kind of art from another. Even acting is 
something finer than the mere repeating, as 
Mr. George Moore would have it, of a por- 
tion of a story invented by another; though 
like singing it is an interpretive art. One is 
inclined, however, to hold with Mr. Moore 
that this age unduly reverences the actor at 
the expense of the dramatist, who, being a 
creator, should in justice stand higher in the 
esteem of the public than his interpreter.

TRIUMPHS OF GERMAN STATE SOCIALISM.* 

It was to be expected that the most sat- 
isfying of the many "interpretations" of 
Germany which have been thrust upon the 
reading public of late would be contained in a 
book written not only in large part before the 
war began, but "as though there were no 
war." Mr. Frederic C. Howe, the author of 
the volume in mind, has been for a quarter of 
a century a student of, and for a decade an 
occasional writer upon, German affairs. He 
has explained for American readers the in- 
tricacies of German municipal government, 
and has called attention forcefully to Ger- 
man principles of taxation, education, and 
social insurance. He has even written a book 
on the Germany of America, the state of 
Wisconsin ! 

In "Socialized Germany," Mr. Howe has 
attempted a somewhat searching analysis of 
German social statecraft in the many phases 
which it has presented since the establish- 
ment of the Empire. At the outset he con- 
fesses to a strong affection for the German 
people, a pronounced liking for the cities of 
Germany, unbounded respect for the German 
educational system, and admiration for the 
Empire's unmatched social legislation. It 
is his conviction that, at least until the war 
began, the German was better off than any 
other man in Europe, if not in the world. 
His country was more intelligently organized 
than were other countries, while he himself 
was better protected in his daily life, better 
prepared for work, more efficient, and more 
happy than anybody else. The conviction is 
expressed, further, that at the outbreak of the 
war Germany had just reached the beginning 
of her greatest achievements, and that had 
not the war intervened, " the next generation 
would have seen her competitors in industry, 
trade, and commerce out-distanced at an 
accelerated speed that would soon have left 
them far and possibly permanently in the 
rear." Finally, it is affirmed that Germany 
may be expected to come off from the war, 
whatever the immediate outcome, relatively 
quite as advantageously situated as she was 
when she went into it. She will turn from 
war to peace with much of the preparedness 
with which she turned from peace to war; 
and even now she is planning far in advance 
for the one, even as formerly she planned far 
in advance for the -other. And this brings 
the author to his principal theses, namely, 
that Germany is what she is to-day by rea- 
son of a new kind of social statesmanship, and

that it is the features of this new statesman- 
ship that the United States and other coun- 
tries must take into consideration if they are 
to be prepared to meet the Germany which, 
in victory or defeat, shall emerge from the 
present conflict. 

In a series of some twenty chapters, Mr. 
Howe describes this new social statesmanship 
to which he attaches such extreme impor- 
tance. He discusses succinctly the characteris- 
tics of the German constitution, the economic 
foundations of class rule, the essential lines 
of recent economic progress, the theory and 
extent of State Socialism, the state-owned 
railways, the operation of canals and water- 
ways, the treatment of unemployment, social 
insurance, education, sanitation, the govern- 
ment and building 1 of cities, municipal land- 
ownership, housing projects, and a multitude 
of other matters. In all of the activities which 
he describes, the measure of efficiency attained 
is, by the common testimony of observers, 
substantial; in some it is fairly phenomenal. 
The unrelieved record of skilled achievement 
in public affairs which Mr. Howe sets down 
is likely, however, to pall somewhat; and the 
reader may be pardoned if he occasionally 
wonders whether, after all, the author has 
been as keen to detect shortcomings and fail- 
ures (there must be some such!) as to gather 
up statistics and other evidences of success. 

It must be admitted that the German social 
and industrial system can easily be portrayed 
in a manner to make it appear very attrac- 
tive, if not well-nigh ideal. The fatal flaw in 
it, however, to the English and American way 
of thinking, is the fact that the system is a 
product of, and is continually sustained by, a 
species of political absolutism. The advan- 
tages possessed by the Germans have been 
gained at a cost which English-speaking peo- 
ples would refuse to pay, a cost taken out 
of individual initiative and liberty. All of 
this Mr. Howe recognizes. Indeed, he frankly 
declares for a badly managed democracy in 
preference to an efficient state of absolutism. 
None the less, it may be questioned whether 
the vitiating effects of German autocracy 
and bureaucracy have been adequately esti- 
mated, and whether the industrial democracy 
of the country is really quite so splendid a 
thing as it is represented to be. 

What Mr. Howe means by "taking into 
consideration" the new, German type of 
statesmanship is made plain by a paragraph 
in his preface. He means that other peoples, 
including Americans, will be obliged to aban- 
don the old conception that the only business 
of organized society is to protect the indi- 
vidual from domestic and foreign aggression. 



" There must be a wide extension of public 
ownership, a greater control of the aggres- 
sions of privilege and property, a big pro- 
gramme of social legislation, a change in our 
system of education, and the exclusion of 
privileged and business interests from the 
long ascendancy which they have enjoyed in 
our political life." The observation is offered 
that it required the war to make this clear to 
Great Britain, and the hope is expressed that 
the United States may now be shaken from 
her complacency as well. 

Mr. Howe is not a Socialist, and, granted 
that special privilege can be abolished and 
industrial freedom attained in other ways, he 
would have society continue to be organized 
upon an essentially non-Socialistic basis. But 
he would see an extension of state activity far 
beyond the limits yet attained in English- 
speaking countries. Again, he perhaps takes 
hardly sufficient account of the noteworthy 
extensions that have been, made, even in our 
own land, in the past ten or fifteen years.

BACONIZESTG SHAKESPEARE.* 



"A history, review and critical study of 
both sides of the Bacon-Shakespeare Ques- 
tion." Such is the wording of the advertise- 
ment that induced me, notwithstanding a firm 
resolution never again to waste a moment's 
time on this " question," to take up the peru- 
sal of Mr. James Phinney Baxter's large and 
forbidding, though handsome, volume enti- 
tled "The Greatest of Literary Problems." 
A more thoroughly misleading advertisement 
was never penned. The book is neither a 
history nor a review of the subject it deals 
with, and anything more uncritical cannot be 
imagined. In reality it is an undisguised and 
vicious attack upon William Shakespeare and 
everything even in the remotest way con- 
nected with him (e.g., his birthplace, ances- 
try, home, education, character, biographers, 
commentators, etc.), and a deification of Sir 
Francis Bacon. Mr. Baxter's book may be 
divided into two parts. In the first part he 
attempts to prove that William " Shakspere " 
of Stratford, an indifferent actor in a London 
theatrical company, did not write the " Shake- 
speare" works and, because of his illiteracy, 
could not have written them; in the second 
he proves, to his own satisfaction, that Bacon 
was the hidden author not only of the Shake- 
speare works but also of all the writings that 
scholars and historians attribute to Marlowe.

Kyd, Greene, Spenser, Peele, B.urton, " and 
others." In what follows I shall consider only 
a few points in the first part of Mr. Baxter's 
book, for it is obvious that unless he can 
prove the first half of his thesis there is no 
reason for giving the other even a thought. 
Shakespeare is in possession, and he must be 
ousted rightfully and unequivocally before 
we can consider another claimant for the title 
of " Prince of Poets." Besides, the latter por- 
tion of Mr. Baxter's book deals with crypto- 
grams, anagrams, symbolisms, cyphers, and 
other mystical things, and that way mad- 
ness lies. 

In his attempt to dethrone Shakespeare, 
Mr. Baxter like every other Baconian 
proceeds in accordance with a definite rule, 
which may be formulated somewhat as fol- 
lows: Traduce the actor-poet and his ances- 
tors; harp on the filthiness of his birthplace 
and his neighbors; run down the Stratford 
Grammar School ; reject as unworthy of 
belief every tradition favorable to the " Strat- 
fordian " ; accept as incontrovertible fact 
every tale that tends to besmirch his char- 
acter ; put the worst possible construction on 
every unexplained circumstance in his life; 
suppress all documentary evidence that will 
not fit into your theory; sneer at the com- 
mentators and call them " pedants " ; pit one 
biographer's conjectures against another's; 
harp on the lawsuits in which Shakespeare 
figured as the plaintiff ; exasperate the ortho- 
dox Shakespearean by spelling the Strat- 
f ordian's name " Shakspere " ; and this above 
all: exaggerate Olympus-high the knowledge 
of law, medicine, scripture, music, linguistics, 
ornithology, botany, philosophy, psychiatry, 
angling, soldiership, astronomy, astrology, 
horticulture, etc., possessed by the author of 
the Shakespeare works. Before we have read 
many pages of Mr. Baxter's book, we are 
assumed to be convinced that " Shakespeare 
the poet" was a high-bred gentleman, an 
aristocrat, a courtier, lawyer, scholar, and 
philosopher of the first magnitude, and that 
" Shakspere the actor " was a " close-fisted, 
shrewd, unscrupulous, avaricious " boor, a 
coarse, ignorant, rude, unpolished, low- 
minded, boisterous, mean, litigious, lascivious, 
lecherous, and adulterous yokel, a frequenter 
of taverns and a professional gambler. (This 
caricature of a man was chosen by Bacon as 
his mask!) Every now and then we are re- 
minded that while so-and-so was going on in 
London the Stratfordian was plying his 
" petty trade and overreaching his neighbors." 

Let us examine a few of Mr. Baxter's argu- 
ments and facts. On page 67 he says, quite 
correctly, while speaking of the licenses 



granted to certain publishers to print some 
of Shakespeare's productions : " It was not 
necessary for the author's name to appear on 
the Stationer's register." Yet on page 105 
he speaks of it as " a striking fact that this 
name is not found in the Stationer's Regis- 
ters." But Shakespeare's name does appear 
in the Stationer's Register. On August 23, 
1600, the Stationer's guild issued a license to 
print " Two bookes . . Muche a Doo about 
Nothinge . . Kinge Henry the iiijth . . Wryt- 
ten by master Shakespere " : on Nov. 26, 1607, 
"A booke called. Master William Shakspeare 
his historye of Kinge Lear " ; and on May 20, 
1609, "A booke called Shakespeares Son- 
nettes." The license to print the first Folio 
is too well known to be reproduced here. 

Mr. Baxter devotes a considerable portion 
of his book to proving that Shakespeare 
" the actor was unknown to contemporary au- 
thors," that very " little personal notice was 
taken of him," that " what was said did not 
identify him with the works which bear his 
name," and that " not one identifies the actor 
with the author of the plays or poems." We 
shall prove every one of these assertions 
false. Shakespeare was very frequently 
spoken of by his contemporaries, some of 
whom even wrote adulatory poems to him. 
The evidence as to this, most of which is to 
be found in Ingleby's " Centurie of Prayse," 
Mr. Baxter suppresses or distorts. He selects 
for quotation only such allusions and refer- 
ences to the poet-dramatist about which there 
can be some doubt, such as Spenser's refer- 
ence to "Action " and to " pleasant Willy." 
The testimony of Chettle, in which, too, 
Shakespeare is not named, he rejects (p. 80) 
on the ground that Chettle was fat ; Greene's 
testimony is rejected (p. 79) because " he died 
after a debauch of pickled herrings and 
Rhenish " ; and Heywood is disqualified as a 
witness on the ground that " we have no rea- 
son to assume that he knew anything about 
the actor's real connection with the works 
which bear his name." Jonson's testimony, 
which identifies Shakespeare the poet with 
Shakespeare of Stratford to a certainty, is 
rejected because he w r as envious, got drunk, 
bragged about himself, fought a duel, and 
employed invectives freely. The testimony 
of Heminge and Condell, the poet's friends, 
theatrical associates, and "editors," is got 
rid of by some hocus-pocus that is unintelligi- 
ble to us. The inscription on the Stratford 
monument is not mentioned. 

The following brief references, not one of 
which is even so much as hinted at by Mr. 
Baxter, although they are all unequivocal 
references to Shakespeare as a poet, are here

introduced as an indication of our author's 
disregard for the truth. In 1598, Francis 
Meres accorded unstinted praise to " melliflu- 
ous and hony-tongued Shakespeare " for his 
poems, sonnets, comedies, arid tragedies, some 
of which he named. Webster, in 1612, eulo- 
gized " the right happy and copious industry 
of Master Shake-speare." In 1614, Thomas 
Freeman wrote an extremely eulogistic son- 
net " to Master W. Shakespeare " in praise of 
his "plaies and poems." The year after 
Meres's "Palladis Tamia" was published. John 
Weever wrote a sonnet praising " Honie- 
tongu'd Shakespeare." and five years later 
(1604) "An (tony) Sc(olloker), gentleman," 
spoke of "friendly Shakespeares tragedies." 
In 1605, Camden included William Shake- 
speare in a list of the " most pregnant wits " 
(i.e., intellects) of the time. Barnfield. too, 
wrote the praises of Shakespeare's " hony- 
flowing Vaine," and in 1615 "Mr. Willi. 
Shakspeare" was included in Stow's "An- 
nals " in a list of " our modern and present 
excellent poets." The dramatist is unequivo- 
cally spoken of as an actor by John Davies in 
a poem "To our English Terence, Mr. Will: 
Shakespeare " who " plaid some kingly parts 
in sport." Mr. Baxter's silence as to these 
important references is the more remarkable 
when we consider the fact that he does not fail 
to apply to Shakespeare a large number of 
unsavory and uncomplimentary allusions to 
unidentified and unidentifiable persons in the 
literature of the period, and to identify 
Shakespeare with ridiculous characters (e.g. 
Crispinus, Sogliardo) in the dramas of his 
contemporaries, although some of these have 
been almost certainly identified with others 
(e. g., Crispinus = Marston). 

Let us next give the reader an illustration 
of how much or little Mr. Baxter knows 
of the facts of Shakespeare's life. Regarding 
the poet's coat-of-arms (p. 34) a subject to 
which he delights to refer on all occasions 
because some have said that the coat was ob- 
tained "fraudulently" and that the transac- 
tion was "discreditable to all concerned" 
he says : 

" In 1596, another application [for armorial 
insignia] was made, coupled with a request for 
permission to impale the arms of Mary Arden, 
his wife. In this case a false statement of her 
ancestry was made, and so it was held up Toy the 
heralds for three years. In 1599 another applica- 
tion was made requesting the recognition of the 
coat of arms of 1596, and the right of the grantee 
to impale . . the coat of arms of the Ardens of 
Wilmecote. At this the heralds again balked, 
realizing that this influential family would protest 
against it; and, finally, an Arden family residing 
in Cheshire was found bearing no relation to the 



Wilmecote Ardens. The remoteness of this fam- 
ily rendered interference improbable, but it might 
prove troublesome, and so the question of an 
Arden impalement was dropped. The request, 
however, for recognition was granted. This ir- 
regular procedure aroused criticism, and objec- 
tions were raised against it on the ground of 
legalizing an infringement, but nothing was done." 
The italics single out the more important 
errors in this passage. Had Mr. Baxter pos- 
sessed the scholar's spirit, and read the origi- 
nal documents pertaining to this matter, he 
would have known that the 1596 application 
said absolutely nothing, directly or indirectly, 
about impaling Mary Arden's arms. The 
applicants made no false statement about her 
ancestry. The allegation in the drafts that 
she was the daughter of Robert Arden, 
"Esquire," contains no falsehood. After 
very careful study of this question, I can say 
that the poet's maternal grandfather was a 
descendant of the Ardens of Warwickshire, 
being the son of Thomas Arden who was the 
second son of Sir Walter Arden, and was 
therefore a "gentleman" and entitled to 
arms. Shakespeare's application for heraldic 
distinction in 1596 was not held up by the 
College of Arms, as I have proved elsewhere. 
After 1596 the poet and his father are almost 
always given the appellation "Master." In 
1599 the Shakespeares made no request for a 
recognition of the arms assigned in 1596, as 
there was no need for doing so. What they 
asked for was the right to impale and quarter 
with their own the arms of Robert Arden of 
Wilmecote. The heralds did not describe 
these arms in the draft, but in a marginal 
sketch they show the following shield : Argent, 
a fess checquy Or and Azure. On the unas- 
sailable authority of Drummond, Camden, 
etc., I can say that this escutcheon was prop- 
erly borne only by the descendants of the 
elder sons of the Warwickshire or Park Hall 
(not "Wilmecote") Ardens. As soon as the 
heralds discovered this technical error, they 
erased these arms and substituted for them 
the following: Gules, three cross-crosslets 
fitchee and a chief Or, with a martlet of the 
first for a difference. This has been called by 
Baconians, and others who have not given the 
subject the study it deserves, the " Cheshire 
Arden arms," on the assumption that it was 
the coat peculiar to this family. As a matter 
of fact it is absolutely certain that it was the 
appropriate escutcheon for younger branches 
of the Park Hall Ardens, just as the fesse 
checquy was for the older branch. At least 
two Warwickshire Ardens, Sir Herald de 
Arden and William, the youngest son of Sir 
Walter, bore the very arms sketched for Mary

[ Dec. 9 



Shakespeare in 1599. The arms of the Cheshire 
Ardens were like those of the younger branch 
of the Park Hall Ardens because the two 
families were related, notwithstanding Mr. 
Baxter's statement to the contrary. The 
action of the heralds was determined by a 
desire for correctness, not by a venal motive. 

No recognition was granted in 1599 because 
none had been asked for. The statement 
that any irregular procedure in connection 
with the Arden impalement had given rise to 
criticism and objections is not true. It was 
because of the 1596 grant that the malicious 
and envious Ralph Brooke preferred charges 
against his superiors. Mr. Baxter's statement 
that nothing was done in the matter is not 
true either. Something was done. A special 
commission was appointed to investigate the 
charges against the College, and in 1602 the 
commission reported that the Shakespeare 
coat-of-arms had been rightly granted because 
John "hath borne magestracy and was Jus- 
tice of peace at Stratford upon Avon, he 
maried the daughter and heire of Arderne 
and was able to maintaine that estate." 

Under the heading, "A Crucial Question," 
Mr. Baxter devotes a chapter of his book to 
proving that the Stratfordian was so illiterate 
that he could barely write his name and that 
therefore it was impossible for him to have 
written the Shakespeare works. To accom- 
plish this marvel, our learned author pours 
out the vials of his sarcasm on Mrs. Thumm- 
Kintzel (who is a graphologist and not a 
handwriting expert) for her analysis of the 
characters of Bacon and of Shakespeare from 
their handwritings, and for her attempted 
proof that Shakespeare's will is a holograph, 
exposes the shallowness of Mr. Gervais and 
of Mr. Pym (not "Pyne") Yeatman as hand- 
writing experts, damns all handwriting ex- 
perts and then sets himself up as one! I 
concede at once that Mr. Gervais was wholly 
in error when he identified the MS. notes in 
a certain volume of Montaigne's Essays as 
being in Shakespeare's hand, that Mr. Yeat- 
man has not proved his case, and that Mrs. 
Kintzel is not to be taken seriously. I also 
concede that Sir Sidney Lee and Professor 
"Wallace are not handwriting experts, but 
then, they never posed as such. Mr. Baxter's 
assertion that the Shakespeare signatures on 
the deed in the Guildhall Library, on the 
mortgage in the British Museum, on the first 
page of the will, and on the Mountjoy affida- 
vit are the labored writings of a person who 
had been taught to write only his signature is 
utterly disproved by his own admissions that 
young William attended the Stratford school 
(knowing how to write was a requisite for 



admission), that he was an actor (and there- 
fore had to have the knowledge requisite to 
reading the script of his parts there were 
no typewriters then), and that these four sig- 
natures differ so much from one another that 
(to ordinary observation) they hardly look like 
the writings of the same individual, and by 
his showing (in a Table on p. 270) that in 
these signatures alone Shakespeare wrote 
three kinds of *, of a, of K, of p, etc. An illit- 
erate person such as Mr. Baxter depicts writes 
his name always the same, does not omit the 
connecting strokes between the letters (be- 
cause he does not know their importance), 
introduces no innovations, abbreviations, 
signs of contraction, or fancy touches, and 
does not know several forms for each letter. 
He writes always one and the same. Inci- 
dentally, it may be remarked that Mr. Bax- 
ter's facsimiles are very bad, crudely traced, 
blurred, blotted, the letters broken up, and 
are of no value whatever for the purpose for 
which they are ostensibly intended. It is also 
worthy of comment that though Mr. Baxter 
professes the greatest contempt for handwrit- 
ing experts (he is evidently not acquainted 
with the admirably scientific work in this field 
done by such men as A. S. Osborn and the 
German graphiographers) , he has absolutely 
no hesitation in calling as his witnesses such 
men as Wellstood, the secretary of the Birth- 
place, Mr. Smedley, a Baconian, and others, if 
their testimony is favorable to his side of the 
case. But it is really unreasonable to expect a 
Baconian or anti- Shakespearean to be logical 
or consistent. In this matter of calligraphy, 
Mr. Baxter does not scruple to go even fur- 
ther. Speaking of the Guildhall signature 
(he means the British Museum signature) , 
he says (p. 278), on the authority of Malone, 
" Steevens acknowledged that he placed the 
a over the signature which has appeared in 
most [ ? some] reproductions since. It was 
the introduction of this spurious a which 
caused him to triumphantly declare that it 
was the trap which caught Ireland in his 
forgeries." Taught by previous experience 
we refer to Malone's " Inquiry," the edition of 
1796, and find that he has been misquoted. 
On page 118 Malone says: "My engraver 
[sic not Steevens] had made a mistake in 
placing an a over the name." and on p. 121 
he says: "Your Lordship sees that if Mr. 
Steevens and I had maliciously intended to 
lay a trap for this fabricator [Ireland] to fall 
into, we could not have done the business 
more adroitly. But you will readily acquit 
us of any such intention." 

Speaking of the autograph lately discov- 
ered by Professor Wallace, an autograph

whose freedom from conventionality and 
whose extremely original terminal abbrevia- 
tion irrefutably demonstrate its owner to have 
been a rapid and facile penman, Mr. Baxter 
makes the false statement that according to 
Professor Wallace the body of the affidavit 
and the deponent's signature are in one hand 
and that we therefore now have "an entire 
page of his handwriting," an opinion that 
that distinguished scholar never expressed and 
that no sensible person ever could express.* 

The autographs on the last two (not "two 
last ") pages of the poet's will, and the words 
" By me," are rejected by Mr. Baxter as evi- 
dence of the testator's skill in penmanship by 
assuming and pretending to be able to prove 
that in writing them the writer's "blunder- 
ing hand " was guided by his attorney. In 
this way Mr. Baxter " accounts for the strong 
resemblance of these signatures to the hand- 
writing of the will " a resemblance which, 
in fact, does not exist. Mr. Baxter finds in 
these signatures " all the earmarks" of having 
been written in the manner he suggests, but 
he does not inform us what these earmarks 
are. Anyone who has ever given this sub- 
ject any scientific consideration knows that a 
signature written by a guided hand does 
really have certain definite characteristics 
(e.g. absence of curves, abrupt breaks in the 
strokes, sudden changes in the direction of 
the strokes, variations in the size and in the 
shading of the letters, irregularities in align- 
ment, misplaced shading, variations in pen 
pressure, evidences of hesitation and con- 
straint, zigzag lines, etc. ; cf. Osborn's " Ques- 
tioned Documents") of which these signatures 
show not a trace. 

Mr. Baxter vents his spleen on all those 
who have done most to bring Shakespeare 
and his writings home to us. Thus the late 
Dr. Furness, as gentle and lovable and accom- 
plished a scholar as ever drew breath, is con- 
stantly spoken of as a pedant, a " monumental 
scholar," a chauvinist, a man who immortal- 
ized himself by his folly, etc. Our author is 
not even above such jejune puerilities as this : 
" Furness, who for nearly forty years dis- 
turbed the black-lead market by his demand 
for pencils to write his multitudinous notes." 
(Wonderful pencils to have been able to do 
that!) 

Mr. Baxter has as little regard for the

was the late Durning-Lawrence who declared them [the depo-

tant questions . . and readers confused by a

told, after the writer had 'shed tears of

carried on his flight to London in his pocket."

SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM. 



A CURIOSITY IN LITERARY HISTORY.* 



When a woman does anything amazing, prov- 
erbial wisdom tells us : " Cherchez Fhomme." 
In the case of her " History of Italian Litera- 
ture," Miss Florence Trail has herself gener- 
ously supplied the missing link. One of the 
last chapters of her book is an eight-page 
eulogy of the clerical polygraph, Cesare 
Cantu. This author, whose bulky literary- 
baggage usually receives a scant paragraph in 
histories of literature, wrote too much to be 
accurate in anything: Like Margites of old, 
"he knew all things, but he knew them all 
badly." He was, moreover, blinded by relig- 
ious prejudice. His " History of Italian Lit- 
erature," drawn from his "Universal History," 
appears to be the vade mecum of the present 
author. 

The following is Miss Trail's plan for her 
work : " To those [writers] of the first impor- 
tance I have devoted a biographical sketch and 
an analysis. Those of the second class are 

* A HISTORY OF ITALIAN LITERATURE. By Florence Trail.

represented by a biographical sketch and a 
translation. The third class have only the 
sketch ; and the fourth are mentioned in pass- 
ing, or in foot-notes." Thus it appears that to 
Miss Trail's mind biography is of primary 
consequence in literary history. Unfortu- 
nately, her " sketches " are by no means always 
accurate, and rarely show any effort to estab- 
lish the relation between biographical details 
and literary production. Following Cantu, 
by whom " never in a single instance is an 
author's work separated from his character " 
she is at great pains to tell us that this man's 
life was blameless, this one's stained with 
immorality. She is rather too generous in 
distributing the orange-blossom wreath of 
purity. Suffice it to say that castae mores 
were not as common in the Renaissance, for 
instance, as her account of certain authors 
would imply. This mania for shielding her 
heroes leads her into some strange interpreta- 
tions. Thus she tells us that Dante's private 
life was wholly immaculate. (Cantu gave his 
unqualified approval to only two writers, 
Dante and Manzoni.) Hence she is at a loss 
to understand the bitter reproaches of Beatrice 
at the summit of the mountain of Purgatory. 
She interprets the " dark wood " at the begin- 
ning of the poem as " the moral and political 
disorder of Italy." For her the three beasts 
who obstruct the poet's passage are " envious 
Florence," " proud France," and " the Roman 
curia, whose supreme characteristic is ava- 
rice." The usual interpretation would give 
these lines a direct bearing on the poet's per- 
sonal experience, the dark wood represents 
worldliness, and the beasts bad habits that 
prevent his reform. The old commentators 
interpreted the latter as luxury, pride, and 
avarice; but the most modern view, which 
w f ould make Dante's meaning still more per- 
sonal, is that the beasts represent incontinence, 
violence, and fraud. It will be remembered 
that the wolf of incontinence proved the great- 
est obstacle to Dante's progress. However it 
may be, few scholars contend to-day that the 
poet's errors were all intellectual. Cantu and 
Miss Trail forget that to Dante's mind unchas- 
tity was a venial sin compared to heresy. Per- 
haps they would exonerate him from both. A 
serious error in the interpretation of the poem 
is Miss Trail's statement that Dante " had not 
been guilty of the crimes of the Inferno, . . 
but he has committed (as who has not?) the 
sins of the Purgatorio." Once more she for- 
gets that the sins punished are the same ; only 
failure to repent condemns souls to hell. 

Another exasperating trait of Miss Trail's 
is the unreserved statement as fact of hypo- 
theses which please her. For instance, she 



declares that Petrarch's lady-love was Madame 
Laura de Sade. " This object of his [Pe- 
trarch's] life-long affection was not only a 
married woman, but continued to live in peace 
and happiness with her husband, and became 
the mother of eleven children." And Madame 
Laura de Sade receives the well-earned eulogy 
for her virtue. 

As for the analyses, they deal with well 
known works, and are rarely used to bring 
out the distinctive features of the author's 
thought. The translations are fair, sometimes 
happy; but, with the analyses, they seem 
meant to take the place of any general esti- 
mate of the author's contribution to the 
thought of his time or of his relations to others. 
A large number of writers are " mentioned in 
passing." It would have been better to omit 
them altogether, for the information given is 
scarcely more than could be found in a pocket 
encyclopaedia. 

It will be noted that Miss Trail says nothing 
about critical estimates in her plan. This 
would seem to be the least important part of 
a history of literature. As a matter of fact, 
such criticism as one finds is thrown out in the 
form of obiter dicta. The two examples which 
follow will perhaps spare the reader vain re- 
grets. The first deals with Boccaccio (ana- 
thema to Cantu) , who is accorded a " sketch " 
and a brief statement of the subjects of his 
works. 

" It is most deplorable that the subject matter 
of these ' Tales ' has made it necessary for the 
literary world to relegate them to an ignominious 
obscurity. Boccaccio is now known simply as the 
author of a book which cannot be read : too 
immoral to be fairly criticised; too offensive for 
vituperation. The only endurable ' Tales ' are 
those of ' Lisa's love for King Alphonso/ and 
' The Marquis of Saluzzo and Griselda.' " 
The second judgment is like unto the first. The 
writer has just summarized a story of Ban- 
dello's in which a woman's virtue stands the 
test. She concludes : 

" This story of the complete triumph of a brave, 
high-spirited woman sets the ball in motion which 
is to produce the modern novel. It will not stop 
until it has completely annihilated all the Tom 
Joneses and the Roderick Randoms." 

On finishing Miss Trail's book, we have but 
one regret : if only she had simply translated 
Cantu's " History," she would have amused us 



still more.

RECENT FICTION.* 

With " These Twain " Mr. Arnold Bennett 
emerges from his occupation with other mat- 
ters and finishes, for the time being at least, 
his great achievement, the " Clayhanger " 
series. The completed work now stands up 
in contemporary fiction something as a great 
cathedral stands up above a crowded town. 
It is unlike a cathedral in that it has very 
little that is religious about it, but it is like it 
in that it is a great monument of popular 
life with one definite purpose and a thousand 
details. One can spend an hour here or there 
in looking at this or that piece of carving, bit 
of sculpture, problem of architecture; or one 
can take in the unity of the whole. Mr. Ben- 
nett has already given us a book about Edwin 
Clayhanger and another about Hilda Less- 
ways; this third gives us the union of the 
two. 

The book has a unity in itself, and anyone 
may read it with pleasure and comprehension 
by itself. But of course it begins with what 
has been given before. It is the same Edwin, 
grown to manhood and still a boy in some 
ways (just as Hilda is in some ways still a 
girl) ; he is, as before, cautious and hesitating 
yet managing to be successful, longing for ro- 
mance yet resigned to an ordinary existence, 
grandiose in conception and slip-shod in exe- 
cution, making everything do while it would 
and waiting for things to turn up, timid and 
proud, meditative and judicial, and yet gener- 
ally saying, " What does it matter? "- a rebel 
against authority yet outwardly apologetic, 
vowing he would never again do what he was 
about to do the next day, wishing for adven- 
ture yet devoted to his home and dependent 
on its hundred minor comforts, undecided for 
months and acting on the spur of a moment's 
impulse, altogether a very inconsistent and 
human person. So, also, is it the same Hilda. 
Not beautiful apparently, originally an " ugly 
young woman " and still with the same olive 
complexion and black hair and thick eye- 
brows, but always attractive, full of vitality, 
of a passionate vibrating voice, with sparkling 
eyes, making cheerily the most outrageous 
remarks that ever woman had made in the 
Five Towns, hating Edwin for opposing her 
and understanding in a flash that he loved 
her, a woman of most tantalizing psychology, 
only part woman in fact and part child, part 
sibyl, yet always tingling with life, bent on 
having her OAvn way because she knew better 
than he what was best, over-valuing what she 
had not and depreciating what was hers, pos-

sessed by irresistible desires and acquiescing 
in a commonplace round of affairs, on the 
whole, quite as inconsistent and human as her 
husband. 

Being married, and settled down in Bur- 
sley, these two were, like many other mar- 
ried people, intent on their own particular 
business and their own particular desires, as 
well as on the life in common which is the 
necessity of married life. Edwin is the 
clearer figure in fact the story is chiefly 
told from his standpoint, and his position 
is plain : he is comfortably situated and 
wishes to remain so. The excitements and 
enthusiasms and revolts of youth have passed, 
and he has settled down into a prosperous 
business man who has few desires beyond 
business success and home comfort. Hilda is 
not so obvious, but whatever she is she is 
something altogether different from that. 
She is continually reaching out, and always 
seeing things that she wants more than the 
things she has got. The two are in love 
even, it would seem, when they passed Mr. 
Bennett's three-year limit, but neither is so 
much in love as to sympathize deeply with 
the other's desires or habits or ways of doing 
or looking at things. 

We might easily enough suppose that there 
is no more definite idea controlling the devel- 
opment of this book than the conception of 
these very interesting characters in the given 
situation, and the willingness to have them 
act in a natural and characteristic way. That 
is enough for many a novelist. Tourguenieff 
used to say, we are told by Mr. James, that 
his idea was to think of interesting people, 
being sure that they would behave in an inter- 
esting way. That is an ultra-realistic view, 
it says, Whatever happens is a story. There 
are people who seem to have some such idea 
to-day, especially those writers who devote 
themselves to telling the life-story of one or 
another. On the other hand, however, there 
are those whose handling of their action is 
controlled in some way or other. Some are 
interested in the working out of some definite 
course of events bound up in a mystery, or an 
adventure, or an achievement. Some develop 
their course of events so as to present some 
definite idea or theory. Mr. Bennett has not 
of late been one of those who cared much for 
a definite course of action ; nor is he, so in this 
his latest book. Nor does he as a rule use his 
action as the form of an idea. In this case, 
it is true, the action is definitely modelled by 
a clear conception, and that conception a 
fundamental proposition (it might seem) to 
married life. The first announcement of the 
book, and its title, show that it deals with 



574 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



marriage. Incidents in the story, so far as 
they have anything to do with each other, are 
illustrations or developments of this idea. 
The end of the book is a discovery (by Edwin) 
of the controlling principle which has so far 
enabled him to be successful in married life. 
It might be added that the publishers tell us 
that " Readers new to Bennett . . will find 
here their own married lives interpreted to 
themselves." It is not clear whether those 
who have read Bennett before will know bet- 
ter than to look for an interpretation of mar- 
riage or anything else; but the idea of the 
publishers seems clearly to be that this recital 
of the married life of Edwin and Hilda was 
modified and formed by a desire on the part 
of the author to present the fundamentals of 
the marriage state. It is true that he deals 
with one marriage only, and that he alludes 
to two other marriages as being in Edwin's 
mind very different affairs. But the thing 
he presents with most conviction is Edwin's 
discovery at the end of the book. These books 
begin with Clayhanger at the bridge, and 
they end there ; they begin with Clayhanger 
looking forward in life, and they end twenty- 
five years later with his looking back on it. 
What he thinks at the beginning is very 
indefinite, but Avhat he thinks at the end is 
very definite. At the beginning he wants to 
get out and be himself; at the end he sees 
that there is much that is wrong in the world 
and that " right living " means the acceptance 
of injustice and the excusing of the inexcusa- 
ble. He sees that people who are married 
must often yield to what seems obviously 
great injustice or unreason on the part of 
others merely because whether they be unjust, 
unreasonable, or whatever else, they are the 
loved ones. This was no novelty. " It was 
banal; it was commonplace; it was what 
everyone knew." Clayhanger had known it 
before, but not until now did he fully real- 
ize it. 

This seems to give the idea that marriage 
is a great and passionate war; its bed-rock 
foundation being the idea of each for himself. 
Love and hate seem not only consistent but 
undistinguishable. Its partners are indis- 
pensable to each other and intolerable. They 
are irrational, and they think each other so; 
yet when they kiss each other they are recon- 
ciled to what in the abstract they cannot 
bear. Such a view of marriage, thoroughly 
realized, made a part of one, felt in one's 
bones, become a dominant factor in one's 
domestic cosmos, would it seems make 
life much easier for persons of incompatible 
tempers who had got into the habit of living 
together. 



But if anyone is inclined to see in the expe- 
rience of Hilda and Edwin an interpretation 
of his own marriage (or possibly hers, though 
the book seems written from the masculine 
standpoint) , it will be well to remember that 
in older days Mr. Bennett " took a malicious 
and frigid pleasure, as I always do, [he adds] 
in setting down facts which are opposed to 
accepted sentimental falsities." The facts of 
" These Twain " are certainly opposed to some 
accepted sentimental falsities; but it may be 
that, fact or no fact, they do not constitute a 
generalization. Seekers after light on the 
dark river will probably find this interpreta- 
tion of the problem of marriage as serious 
and profound as Mr. Bennett's interpretation 
of the problem of evil in the world. Many 
people cannot see reason or justice in hus- 
band or wife and yet still love and like to 
please each other. In like manner, people 
who do wrong incomprehensibly are yet 
driven to do so by an irresistible force, 
namely, they like to please themselves. In 
both cases they do what they want to do. 
This comes very near to "A is A," the princi- 
ple of identity which is the foundation of 
logical thought. 

Mr. Bennett would probably disclaim teach- 
ing. When he wishes to teach he writes a 
"pocket philosophy." In his novels he tells 
of people who lived and acted thus and thus. 
His telling is always interesting. Sometimes 
he is objective, as they say, and tells how 
everything and everybody looked. He always 
seems to know, though it does not always 
occur to him to say much about it. Some- 
times he is satirical, indeed, he always seems 
a little outside the people he tells us of, never 
quite to sympathize with them; and in such 
a position one can hardly help being a little 
satirical now and then. Sometimes he is ex- 
travagant, like the Bennett of old times, the 
Bennett of "Hugo" or "The Grand Babylon 
Hotel"; and that, after all, is only another 
way of being satirical. Most often, however, 
he is telling us of the inner life of one or 
another. It is because he knows these things 
that he can tell the story. He knows what 
Edwin Clayhanger thought and wanted, and 
why he did things: and he knows also about 
Hilda, though not quite so well ; and he knows 
about the others, for of course the book is full 
of living real people. How he knows these 
mysteries of the human heart no one can tell ; 
but that he does know is clear from the con- 
sistency, the firmness, of the general view. 
He does not say, " Life is like this," but we 
admit that that life must have been like that. 

There is possibly one thing more to say. 
We can imagine that a novelist should know 



1915]

precisely how his people looked, and how 
their surroundings looked, and what every- 
body did. We can imagine, too, that a nov- 
elist should know everything that his people 
felt, thought, wished, and so on, in fact, 
that is part of the game. But given the sec- 
ond supposition, does a novelist do the fair 
thing by us if he withholds information con- 
cerning certain very large elements in the 
lives he is presenting to us? In this book we 
are told much, but much is withheld. We 
have very slight knowledge of how Edwin 
conducted his business; we are told that he 
prospered and became well off, but it seems 
astonishing that such should be the case. We 
also have the very slightest notion of what 
this couple thought of religious matters ; it is 
evident that they thought something, and we 
should say from general principles and pre- 
vious knowledge that they thought the matter 
of some importance. But we know little of it. 
Mr. Bennett presumably feels that he has told 
all that is necessary for normally informed peo- 
ple about their relations as man and wife ; but 
in that matter people are so unexpected that 
common inference is easily at fault. So there 
are considerable gaps in our acquaintance 
with the situation. Business, religion, sex, 
these are likely to be dominant forces in the 
personal life; it may be that the result Mr. 
Bennett presents was caused by reasons of 
which he does not tell us. 

But in spite of all such things, the book, as 
well as the completed trilogy, is a great 
achievement. It gives us a sense of reality, 
of life as we find it, difficult to get elsewhere. 
And it gives that strange sense of satisfaction 
with life and approval of it that is a result 
of great art. EDWARD E. HALE. 



HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS.

BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY. 
Excellent for its presentation of the real Clara 
Barton, as portrayed by her own pen, is Dr. Percy 
H. Epler's biography of that famous woman 
the authorized biography and a work bearing every 
mark of faithful industry on the part of its author. 
" The Life of Clara Barton " (Macmillan) is not 
unlike Sir Edward Cook's recent account of Flor- 
ence Nightingale, being largely autobiographic in 
method, and nearly as substantial in bulk, though 
brought within the limits of a single volume. But 
the resemblance is not confined to externals; the 
same keen observation and gift of humorous ex- 
pression appear in the quoted letters and diaries 
of each. Laughter must have been a necessity to 
both, else the strain of the horrors they forced 
themselves to face would have been unendurable. 



Clarissa Harlowe Barton it is amusing to think 
of her having been christened " Clarissa Har- 
lowe" died three years ago, and this interval 
her biographer has put to good use in making as 
complete and as accurate as possible his record of 
the great work done by the founder of the Amer- 
ican branch of the Red Cross Society. Many por- 
traits of "the Angel of the Battle Field'" are 
given, with numerous other illustrations. 

" The Passing of the Armies " is not a pacifist 
tract, but " an account of the final campaign of 
the Army of the Potomac, based upon personal 
reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps," and its, 
author is General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain,, 
whose death as the book was about to go to the 
printer made necessary its final revision by his 
children. The extraordinary range of the author's 
talents adds to the interest of this his last work 
as a writer. Perhaps he is best remembered as 
president of Bowdoin College from 1876 to 1883> 
where also he had distinguished himself as teacher 
and lecturer. Theology, languages, literature, law- 
all these he seems to have taught with success ; 
and in the larger world he won fame as a military 
commander, filled a position of some importance 
in the civil service, visited Italy and Egypt in 
later life, and from time to time acquitted hinb- 
self most creditably as a public speaker. Thus,- 
his contribution to our Civil War history is more 
than the record of a mere soldier; it is a schol- 
arly and readable book, with the fresh interest 
belonging to personal recollections of great events. 
Mr. George Haven Putnam writes a short bio- 
graphical introduction, and the book is published-, 
with portraits and maps, by the firm of which ha 
is head. 

Life is felt by many to be too short to admit of 
even a single rapid reading of Gibbon's great his- 
torical work, and to these a book like Mr. H. B. 
Cotterill's " Medieval Italy" (Stokes) offers a 
welcome epitome of later Roman history, with 
much additional matter to illustrate and make 
more interesting the chronicle of the thousand 
years (305-1313) covered by the survey. As its 
title-page announces, the book contains not only 
" a brief historical narrative," but also " chapters 
on great episodes and personalities and on sub- 
jects connected with religion, art, and literature."" 
To each of the five parts into which the subject 
naturally divides itself is prefixed " a brief account 
of the political events of the period in question,"" 
and these summaries, the author hopes, "will 
enable the reader to frame, or perhaps I should' 
say to arrange in chronological order and per- 
spective, the contents of those chapters in which' 
with a freer hand I sketch certain interesting 
episodes and personalities, endeavouring by means: 
of quotation and description to add a little in the- 
way of local colour and portraiture." x Thus the j 
drum-and-trumpet part of the story is made not 
to intrude upon the more richly significant and 
far more readable portions of the work. A profu- 
sion of illustrations, some in photogravure, with 
tables, maps, footnotes, and index, contribute iir 
their several ways to the usefulness and: interest 
of the book.

THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

A devoted Meredithian, designated on the title- 
page with no superfluity of printer's ink as 
" F. E. Green," gives us an excellent descriptive 
volume on Meredith's country, with frequent quo- 
tations from the novelist's letters and a fine series 
of illustrations (photogravures and line draw- 
ings) , including a " view from George Meredith's 
window," " George Meredith's chalet," and " the 
Crossways," by Mr. Elliott Seabrooke. " The Sur- 
rey Hills," as the book is called, is not exclusively 
or even chiefly devoted to Meredith, but certain 
chapters, as " On Box Hill with Meredith," and 
" Over Ranmore to Diana's House," take their 
note from Diana's creator. Elsewhere there is an 
abundance of wide-ranging allusion and miscel- 
laneous dialogue to diversify the description, which 
itself is generously interlarded with local history. 
On an early page a misprint that will vex the 
author, and that he will be glad to have corrected 
in later editions, gives us " the dramatic extension 
of the old peasant stock, as its vitality was low- 
ered by the successive general Enclosure Acts," 
where " extension " should undoubtedly be " ex- 
tinction." As an informal and attractive guide to 
some of the more interesting parts of Surrey, the 
book could hardly be better. (Frederick Warne 
& Co.) 

" It ain't much trouble for me to take care of 
my family," said the New England farmer's hired 
man ; " I git 'em all under cover every time I put 
on my hat." With such characteristic bits of 
shrewdly humorous Yankee talk does Mr. Clifton 
Johnson enliven the pages of his latest " High- 
ways and Byways " book, being the seventh in the 
series and devoted to New England. Not a sys- 
tematic and consequently unentertaining guide- 
book have we here, any more than in the preceding 
volumes of the set; but rather a collection of 
sketches, full of character and not seldom redolent 
of the soil. The chapters on "Artemus Ward's 
Town," "Old Put's Country," "August in the 
Berkshire Hills," and " Nantucket Days " are not 
half bad, to put it mildly. As is his custom, the 
author profusely illustrates his book with camera 
glimpses of life, both still and of a less reposeful 
sort, all admirably typical of the region and people 
concerned. It is cheering to find so much of rural 
New England still unspoiled, uncorrupted, un- 
sophisticated. " Highways and Byways of New 
England " is published by the Macmillan Co. 

Luckily there are no such melancholy associa- 
tions connected with the many beautiful illustra- 
tions that go to the making of " Paris, Past and 
Present " (Lane) as link themselves to-day with 
similar representations of many French cities not 
a hundred miles from Paris. This notable collec- 
tion of colored and uncolored drawings, etchings, 
lithographs, and other products of artistic skill, 
not far from two hundred in number, is edited by 
Mr. Charles Holme, with text by Mr. E. A. Tay- 
lor, and constitutes a special autumn number of 
" The Intel-national Studio." Old prints and a 
great number of later artists have been drawn 
upon, so that we have glimpses of the French 



capital from 1539 to the present time, grouped 
under three headings : " The Rivers, Bridges and 
Quays," " Old Streets, Houses and Markets," and 
" Public Buildings, Monuments and Gardens." 
Brief preliminary surveys from Mr. Taylor's pen 
introduce the several sections, and a general intro- 
duction follows the table of contents. Issued in 
paper covers, the work offers opportunity to 
exercise judgment and taste in giving it a suitable 
binding. 

Travel and adventure, hunting and sight-seeing, 
in all latitudes and longitudes, are brought within 
the covers of a good-sized volume edited by Mr. 
A. G. Lewis and entitled " Sport, Travel, and 
Adventure" (London: T. Fisher Unwin). Fifty- 
four books by writers of wanderlustig propensi- 
ties have been drawn upon for suitable selections 
and illustrations, and the whole is a lively collec- 
tion of travellers' tales. Satisfactory though the 
editor's selections are in the main, it is somewhat 
surprising to find many topics represented by 
writers that are by no means the ones first sug- 
gesting themselves as the likeliest to be quoted 
from. Arctic exploration, for instance, gives us 
not a line from Captain Peary's books; African 
adventure calls forth nothing from Livingstone's 
or Stanley's noted chronicles; Swiss mountain- 
climbing is unillustrated by anything from Whym- 
per; and though forbidden Tibet is opened to our 
view, it is not by Mr. Henry Savage Landor. But 
we have passages from Colonel Roosevelt and 
Mr. Richard Harding Davis and Miss Annie S. 
Peck, and many other hardy adventurers, and we 
must not complain. 

Mr. Albert G. Robinson, who has both visited 
and written about the Philippines and Cuba and 
Porto Rico, adds another book to his list in 
"Cuba, Old and New" (Longmans), a survey of 
the salient points in the island's history, with chap- 
ters of a descriptive and otherwise instructive 
character, including information useful to the tour- 
ist who at this season is tempted to escape the 
northern rigors by a sojourn in the Pearl of the 
Antilles. Cuba's needs and imperfections are not 
overlooked by the author, whose twenty years of 
more or less immediate contact with its affairs enti- 
tle him to speak understandingly. " Full assur- 
ance of peace and order," he believes. " will come 
cnly when the people of the island, whether plant- 
ers or peasants, see clearly the difference between 
a government conducted in their interest and a 
government conducted by Cubans along Spanish 
lines." Photographs by Mr. Robinson illustrate 
the volume. 

New Mexico's old mission churches are disap- 
pearing with alarming rapidity, far more from the 
ravages of man than from those of nature; and 
hence Dr. L. Bradford Prince does well to issue 
at this time his long-contemplated volume on 
" Spanish Mission Churches of New Mexico " 
(The Torch Press). Much more interesting he 
believes these churches to be than the similar 
structures of California, about which so many 
books have been written, while the riches of the 
Sunshine State in this particular remain practi- 
callv unknown. Half a hundred or more of these 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



577 



relics of a romantic past are pictured by the 
camera and described by the pen in his book, 
which has also an abundance of historical infor- 
mation such as few besides the author could have 
supplied. But he adds no index to this rich store 
of material. Otherwise the work makes a most 
favorable impression. 

NATURE AND OUT-DOOR LIFE. 

No one having any knowledge of birdless Italy 
will refuse to commend the purpose of Mr. Ernest 
Harold Baynes's "Wild Bird Guests: How to 
Entertain Them" (Button). It has long been the 
author's belief that " the final solution of the prob- 
lem of wild bird conservation lay, not in the enact- 
ing of more or better laws, necessary as those laws 
are, but in the creation of such an interest in, and 
love for birds, that a very large majority of peo- 
ple will have not only no desire to destroy them, 
but will actually fight to prevent their destruc- 
tion; and that the birds themselves will become 
as safe as valuable private property." Well- 
informed chapters on our feathered friends, their 
habits, their enemies, their value in more senses 
than one, and how to promote their well-being, 
follow the hortatory foreword; and numerous 
photogravure illustrations, many from the author's 
own camera, are interspersed. Meriden, N. H., 
" the Bird Village " and the author's home, plays 
a prominent part in the book, which ends with 
useful instructions how to f onn bird clubs and 
thus add to the bird villages throughout the coun- 
try. Mr. Baynes evidently knows how to make 
friends of the birds, and he seems likely also to 
make friends of his readers. 

No extraordinary experiences of a wild-fowler, 
no record-breaking "bags" of mallard, widgeon, 
teal, pochard, pintail, and their kind, no freezing 
nights in an open boat, heroically survived by this 
same hardy fowler in his valorous campaigns 
against the feathered tribes that sweep over the 
waters of estuaries and marshes- nothing what- 
ever of this sort will be found in Mr. W. H. Hud- 
son's "Adventures among Birds" (Kennerley), tlte 
ornithographic record of a bird-lover, not the san- 
guinary chronicle of a bird-killer. He regards 
birds as " vertebrates and relations, with knowing, 
emotional, thinking orains like ours, and with 
senses like ours, only brighter." Mr. Hudson's 
literary style has been warmly praised by others 
besides Mr. John Galsworthy, who says of him, 
furthermore, that " he is the finest living observer, 
and the greatest living lover of bird and animal 
life, and of Nature in her moods." A few of his 
chapter-headings, such as " Bird Music." " In a 
Green Country in Quest of Rare Songsters," "Ava- 
lon and a Blackbird," and " The Marsh AVarbler's 
Music," will here sufficiently indicate the char- 
acter of his book. A word of perhaps not super- 
fluous caution from the publishers admonishes the 
reader not to confuse the author with that other 
writer of note, Mr. William Henry Hudson. 

Mr. Emerson Hough, the author of " Out of 
Doors" (Appleton), seems to have hunted and 
camped and communed with nature from Mexico's 
troubled border to Alaska's icy strand, and in his 



new book he communicates in racy and pictur- 
esque language the ripe results of his varied expe- 
riences in the wild. Both the broad fundamentals 
of successful camping and the superstructure of 
minute details are to be found in his useful and 
entertaining manual. Among other notable chap- 
ters mention should be made of his dissertations on 
" The Woman in Camp," " Getting Lost and What 
to Do about it," and " The Faculty of Observa- 
tion." Here are his concluding remarks upon the 
properly constructed camp stew : " Fed upon this 
manner of manna or manna of manner, as they 
would say in New York you shall go forth and 
prevail mightily in the land. As to what such a 
stew as this would mean to a party of tired coon 
hunters at midnight's holy hour hush, man, let 
us not speak of sacred matters ! " 

Both novel and practical in its scheme is Mr. 
Leicester Bodine Holland's horticultural manual, 
"The Garden Bluebook" (Doubleday). Peren- 
nials only, as is indicated in a subtitle, are consid- 
ered by the author; but as nearly two hundred of 
these are included in the book the proposed garden 
need not lack for richness and variety. A folding, 
linen-backed, colored chart begins the volume and 
shows with much ingenuity in disposition of hues 
and scale-markings how and when and where to 
expend your horticultural energies in order to pro- 
duce the most striking and picturesque effects. 
Other charts and plans follow, and the body of the 
book is devoted to' descriptions and illustrations of 
the principal perennials, in alphabetic order on 
the right-hand pages, with blank forms, on the 
left-hand, to be filled in with observations and 
additions by the gardener owning the book. A 
many-hued perennial garden almost exhales its 
fragrance on the cover, and the more subdued half- 
tone lavishly illustrates the pages of the book. 
The Christmas holidays might be given to less 
profitable and also less pleasant uses than the 
planning of one's garden of perennials with the 
help of " The Garden Bluebook." 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Not as an argument for military preparedness, 
we are glad to note, does Mr. John Martin Ham- 
mond offer to view the dismantled and crumbling 
condition of our older fortresses, but as a study in 
what is historic and often picturesque. " Quaint 
and Historic Forts of North America " (Lippin- 
cott) he entitles his splendid volume, a work simi- 
lar in wealth of descriptive and illustrative matter 
to his " Colonial Mansions of Maryland and Dela- 
ware." It is on the Atlantic seaboard, naturally, 
that he finds the greater number of our weather- 
worn fortifications, though the Alamo, Fort Lara- 
mie, Fort Vancouver, and other storied redoubts 
in the South, West, and North, claim their meas- 
ure of attention. Of our "most important En- 
glish military work of early Colonial days," Fort 
Independence, in Boston harbor, he writes, with 
an eye for the picturesque rather than for the 
bare reality, that " on any bright and cheering 
day throngs can be found at the old fort, of 
various classes and of widely sundered poles of 
thought." On some holidays this may be true, but 



578 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



many a bright and cheering day of labor finds the 
fort not at all thronged with visitors of any class 
or of any pole of thought whatsoever. Good illus- 
trations in abundance adorn the book. 

Very wisely has it been decided to issue in book- 
form and with additions Miss Lilian D. Wald's 
recent "Atlantic " articles on " The House in 
Henry Street" (Holt), the story of a vocation or 
mission promptly and gladly accepted some five 
and twenty years ago by a young graduate of a 
New York training school for nurses, and leading 
to more beneficent, more wide-reaching results than 
could have been dreamed of at the outset. In a 
straightforward manner that devoted friend of 
suffering and unfortunate humanity, as it toils 
and struggles on the East Side of our cosmopoli- 
tan metropolis, tells the story of her labors amid 
that grimy and often cheerless environment; and 
the story divides itself into chapters on srfch 
varied though related themes as the establishment 
of visiting nurses, the relations between the nurse 
and the community, children and play, children 
who work, the handicapped child, youth and trades 
unions, weddings and social halls, friends of Rus- 
sian freedom, social forces, and new Americans in 
their relation to our institutions and policies. A 
number of noted philanthropists, such as Madame 
Breshkovsky, Prince Kropotkin, Mr. Ernest 
Crosby, and Father McGlynn, pass across the 
pages of the book and add to its interest. Its 
message of good will to all mankind is one espe- 
cially suited to the season. Mr. Abraham Phil- 
lips's etchings and drawings, often of an appealing 
nature in their representations of the joys and 
sorrows of the poor, supplement very fittingly the 
photographic illustrations that help to convey the 
book's message and lesson. 

Near the end of July of last year, with no slight- 
est foreboding of the troubled days so soon to 
follow, Miss Anne Hollingsworth Wharton of 
Philadelphia landed at Plymouth, England, to pur- 
sue the studies that have now resulted in a pleasing 
volume entitled " English Ancestral Homes of 
Noted Americans" (Lippincott). The Washing- 
tons, the Franklins, the Penns, with other families 
of lesser note, are here traced back to their trans- 
atlantic cradles, and the faithful camera has been 
put to good use in conveying a vivid impression 
of these remote origins. The book is, as the author 
had hoped it would be, an interesting reminder of 
" the rock from whence we were hewn and the pit 
from whence we were digged." A wealth of his- 
torical and genealogical lore is contained between 
the book's covers, and especial mention may be 
made of certain fresh material concerning Frank- 
lin's visit to Ecton, the home of his ancestors. ' 

Mr. Lewis Spence says he has endeavored so to 
arrange his " Hero Tales and Legends of the 
Rhine" (Stokes) that they may "illustrate a 
Rhine journey from sea to source the manner 
in which the majority of visitors to Germany will 
make the voyage and to this end the tales have 
been marshalled in such form that a reader sitting 
on the deck of a Rhine steamer may be able to 
peruse the legends relating to the various locali- 



ties in their proper order as he passes them." 
Why, then does he place the story of the Lorelei 
at the very beginning and not later when the high- 
lands, where the Loreleiberg may be supposed to 
stand, have been reached by the Rhine-ascending 
traveller? Diligence in collecting and narrative 
skill in relating these legends are shown by the 
compiler, who claims for his book more critical 
a,nd selective acumen and more of the romantic 
Rhine atmosphere than are to be found in other 
similar compilations. The very places concerned 
have been visited in quest of the most authentic 
form of each tale, " and only the most character- 
istic and original versions and variants . . have 
gained admittance to the collection." It is cer- 
tainly a rich and readable volume, and it has a 
map of the Rhine country, a combined index and 
glossary, and many illustrations (in color and 
otherwise) by an artist in evident sympathy with 
the purpose of the book. 

Not the least part of the burden of the present 
war is borne by the Red Cross, and its sendees 
have never before been offered so generously or to 
so vast a body of sufferers. Timely, therefore, is 
the appearance of a book giving a more compre- 
hensive account of this organization and its labors 
for humanity than has hitherto been available in 
English. " Under the Red Cross Flag at Home 
and Abroad " (Lippincott) is written by Miss 
Mabel T. Boardman, Chairman National .Relief 
Board, American Red Cross, and naturally con- 
cerns itself especially with the American branch 
of the society, dating from 1881 and claiming 
Clara Barton as its first leader and presiding offi- 
cer. The record of its beneficent labors in fire 
and flood, tornado and earthquake, war and pesti- 
lence, is traced with considerable detail down to 
and including its activities in the war now devas- 
tating Europe and extending even beyond its 
borders. The revised Treaty of Geneva is ap- 
pended, and illustrations from photographs show 
the varied nature of the demands made upon Red 
Qross workers. With Dr. Epler's life of Clara 
Barton and Miss Boardman's history of the Red 
Cross, both books of the present season, we have 
small excuse if we remain ignorant of what this 
charitable association has done in the past and is 
doing in the present. 

" It is commonly charged against philosophers 
that they have little patriotism. It does not occur 
to those who prefer the charge that philosophers 
may have something better about which to concern 
themselves." Thus writes Dr. Frederic Rowland 
Marvin on an early page of his " Fireside Papers " 
(Sherman), and the passage well illustrates the 
tone and temper of the book. Here, as in the 
same author's " Excursions of a Book-Lover," high 
thinking and ripened wisdom mingle en joy ably 
with quaint and curious lore of various kinds, with 
criticism of books and men, and with quotation 
and translation of poetry from divers sources. Of 
Mr. Alfred Noyes he well says that " he has writ- 
ten too much for the years of his literary pil- 
qrimage thus far. We have from his pen some 
good things, more that are poor, and none yet 
that take commanding place and give promise of

enduring." With such themes as the loneliness of 
genius, the philosophic temper, human derelicts, 
Maupassant and Poe, and the River of Oblivion, 
the book holds our willing attention. 

In these days when the bottom seems to be fall- 
ing out of everything, it is no work of supereroga- 
tion to endeavor to fasten with certainty upon 
those things that are firm and imperishable. Such 
an attempt is made by Dr. Hugh Black in his con- 
tribution to this season's books, a modest volume 
entitled "The New World" (Revell), four chap- 
ters of which have already found favor with 
magazine-readers. " The purpose of this book," 
he explains, " is to understand the causes of unrest 
in the religion of our time, and to enforce the 
need of restatement, and if possible to indicate the 
lines of the probable statement. . . The most I 
seek to do is to suggest for a transition time like 
this a point of view that may enable some to hold 
their footing." Accordingly, the discussion has to 
do with the spirit of the age, the changing order, 
the things that remain, and other kindred and 
fruitful themes, all handled with the author's cus- 
tomary insight and helpful suggestiveness. 

Miss Lilian Bell tells the story of a happy 
thought and its beneficent results in " The Story 
of the Christmas Ship" (Rand, McNally & Co.), 
a generous octavo filled with details of the great 
charitable enterprise started by her last year in 
behalf of the hosts of children made fatherless by 
the war in Europe. Seven million gifts from 
American children went across the Atlantic in the 
U. S. S. "Jason" and into the Christmas stockings 
of the unfortunate little folk of the warring coun- 
tries. Miss Bell writes with her usual vivacity, and 
the very aspect of her pages, with their innumer- 
able short paragraphs, their thick sprinkling of 
exclamation points, their frequent dashes, and 
other appeals to the eye, is hardly characteristic 
and perhaps not ineffective. Her portrait is the 
only illustrative feature of the book, which might 
well have been enlivened with camera views of 
incidents narrated, if such visual records had been 
available. A brilliant binding and wrapper make 
up the exterior equipment of this notable Christ- 
mas book. 

From Philip Freneau to Paul Lawrence Dun- 
bar, the better-known nineteenth-century American 
poets, to the number of nearly a hundred and 
fifty, are represented in Miss Jessie B. Ritten- 
house's pocket anthology, " The Little Book of 
American Poets" (Houghton), a companion vol- 
ume to " The Little Book of Modern Verse " com- 
piled by the same hand. A few overlappings in 
the two lists of verse-writers inevitably occur, 
since the end of the nineteenth century did not, 
fortunately, bring an end to all our songsters of 
that period; and where inadequate space may 
seem to have been allotted to a contemporary poet 
in the later volume, he will be found to be more 
fully represented in the earlier. In its professed 
purpose " to present in compact form some of the 
finer and more enduring things in our poetic lit- 
erature " this handy volume has attained a good 
measure of success. 



The name of Etienne de la Boetie, if known only 
by the poem of Emerson at the head of which it 
stands, helps no little to quicken interest in Mon- 
taigne's short essay on friendship which was ad- 
dressed to this best friend of the writer. In a 
limited edition, with rubricated initials and head- 
pieces, and with other attributes of excellence, 
there are published both " Montaigne's Essay on 
Friendship " and " XXIX Sonnets by Estienne de 
la Boetie," translated by Mr. Louis How. Love 
and friendship are the themes of the sonnets, 
which thus appropriately supplement the prose 
treatise similarly inspired. Evident care and skill 
have been bestowed upon the rendering of both 
prose and verse, the obvious difficulties in each 
case, and especially in the latter, being a spur to 
best endeavor. (Houghton Mifflin Co.) 

Not unworthy of its splendid theme is the title 
chosen by Dr. J. Edward Parrott for his book, 
"The Pageant of English Literature" (Sully & 
Klein teich), a companion volume to his similarly 
named work on English history. From the rude 
beginnings of his country's literature down to the 
death of Tennyson he sketches in popular style 
the main facts in that literary history, with brief 
outlines or descriptions of the more famous works 
and with occasional illustrative quotations. The 
biographical element, too, is not wanting, and a 
rich pageantry of color meets the eye in half the 
numerous illustrations, chiefly from famous paint- 
ings. Ample pages, wide margins, and large print 
contribute to the book's sumptuous appearance, 
and in its reading matter it betters expectation by 
devoting its first five chapters to the beginnings of 
literature in general something not promised in 
the title. As giving a bird's-eye view of its field, 
and as a useful and attractive work for young 
readers, the book is to be commended. 

All is certainly not right with the world as 
viewed by Mr. Seymour Deming in his " profane 
baccalaureate," "The Pillar of Fire" ( Small, May- 
nard & Co.). Let us have done, he urges, with the 
smoothly conventional baccalaureate sermon and 
tell our graduating classes the plain, unvarnished 
truth. "Are you content," he asks, with exuberance 
of rhetoric, " to scan sonorous Sophoclean odes 
which bewail a fate-begotten plague in seven-gated 
Thebes whilst there are, on the island of Manhat- 
tan, fifty-one blocks huddling 3,000 people to each, 
through which creeps the icy contagion of tubercu- 
losis ? " Again : " How shall the college be brought 
back to its rightful task, the teaching of revolu- 
tionism? By the likes of you. Seek and ye shall 
find." In this vehement vein, enlivened in one 
place by a " Socratic scherzo," and in another by 
a list of " dishonorary degrees," the author val- 
iantly strives to set right a world that is all wrong. 

" We are not loved as a nation," says Professor 
Edward A. Steiner, " largely because* we are not 
understood, and we are not understood because we 
do not understand ourselves, and we do not under- 
stand ourselves because we have not studied our- 
selves in the light of the spirit of other nations." 
Something of this detached view of ourselves is 
offered in Mr. Steiner's latest book, " Introducing

THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 9 



the American Spirit" (Revell), in which he de- 
scribes with vivacity and humor his experience as 
host and cicerone to a visiting German of some 
note, whom he calls " the Herr Director," and who, 
it should be added, is accompanied by " the Frau 
Directorin." Enthusiastic in his devotion to his 
adopted country, and with no hyphen disfiguring 
his Americanism, the host played his part so well 
as almost to overcome some of the prejudices of 
his guests from Berlin. At any rate, his effort, as 
described by himself, was most creditable to him 
and is very enjoyable in the reading. 

" If laughing hurts you, let this book alone ! '' 
is the caution displayed on the wrapper of " The 
Log of the Ark, by Noah ; Hieroglyphics by Ham ; 
Excavated by I. L. Gordon and A. J. Frueh " 
(Button). It belongs, of course, to that class of 
might-have-been ancient humor in which Mr. 
Maurice Baring and others have in recent years 
exercised their wits with much nimbleness and to 
the augmentation of the mirth of the world. Here 
is a specimen of Noah's facetious manner : " I 
had everybody guessing at the supper table. I 
asked them where Moses is going to be when the 
light goes out. The officers and their wives are 
trying to guess." The drawings that enliven this 
logbook are undeniably amusing. All interested in 
the personalities and idiosyncrasies of Noah, Shem, 
Ham, Japheth, and their respective wives, will 
find the book entertaining. 

Hawaiian legends have a quality of their own, 
even though they show many of the characteristics 
of folklore in general, and the noting of these 
points of difference and of resemblance adds to 
the enjoyment of reading such a collection as that 
edited and translated by Mr. William Drake Wes- 
tervelt under the title, "Legends of Old Hono- 
lulu." Mr. Westervelt is a resident of Honolulu 
and has had experience in the re-telling of Polyne- 
sian stories for English-speaking readers; there- 
fore it is with more than the average folklore- 
student's familiarity with his subject that he puts 
into literary form the twenty-five or more local 
legends which he has gathered from Hawaiian 
sources. The book is of pleasing design, with 
tinted leaves, tinted print, and tinted half-tone 
illustrations and line drawings. It is published 
by George H. Ellis Co., Boston. 

How the popular lecture, "Acres of Diamonds," 
came into being, and many significant facts about 
its author, the Rev. Russell H. Conwell, D.D., 
President of Temple University, Philadelphia, are 
readably set forth by Mr. Robert Shackleton in a 
volume bearing the same title as the lecture and 
published by the Harpers. The marks of a force- 
ful personality are on everything done and every 
word spoken by the man introduced to us by his I 
present biographer, and a further tribute to his | 
striking qualities is rendered by his neighbor and 
intimate friend for thirty years, Mr. John Wana- 
maker, in a brief " appreciation " prefixed to the 
lecture itself for this, too, is included in the 
book. Two portraits of Dr. Conwell and other 
illustrations are inserted, and a brief autobio- 
graphic note, " Fifty Years on the Lecture Plat- 
form," closes the book. 



NOTES. 



A new edition of Mr. Louis C. Elson's " History 
of American Music," revised and brought down to 
date, is promised for early issue by the Mac- 
millan Co. 

" How Diplomats Make War " is the promising 
title of an anonymous volume which Mr. B. W. 
Huebsch will publish at once. The author is 
described as " a British statesman." 

" Old Familiar Faces " was the title chosen by 
the late Theodore Watts-Dunton for his volume of 
recollections of the many famous men and women 
with whom he had been on terms of friendship. 
It has just appeared in London, and will undoubt- 
edly find American publication also. The editor 
contributes an Introduction dealing with life at 
" The Pines." 

Hon. Bertrand Russell, of Cambridge, England, 
has recently been awarded the Butler Gold Medal 
by Columbia University for the best work in 
philosophy during the past five years. Mr. Rus- 
sell's latest book, " Our Knowledge of the Exter- 
nal World as a Field for Scientific Method in 
Philosophy," was issued by the Open Court Pub- 
lishing Co. in July of last year. 

Among other new titles announced for early 
publication by the University of Chicago Press are 
"A Short History of Belgium," by Professor Leon 
Van der Essen ; " Individuality in Organisms," by 
Professor Charles Manning Child ; " Public Libra- 
ries and Literary Culture in Ancient Rome," by 
Dr. Clarence E/Boyd; and "Parts of the Body 
in Older Germanic and Scandinavian," by Dr. 
Trild W. Arnoldson. 

A series of histories of the belligerents in the 
present war is announced by the Oxford University 
Press. The first two volumes will be " The Evolu- 
tion of Prussia: The Making of an Empire," by 
Messrs. J. A. R. Marriott and C. Grant Robertson ; 
and " The Balkans and Turkey : The History and 
Development of the Balkan States and the Turkish 
Empire," by Messrs. Nevill Forbes, D. Mitrany, 
Arnold Toynbee, and others. 

Dr. George W. Crile, whose recently published 
volume entitled "A Mechanistic View of War and 
Peace" is the result of several months spent last 
summer in a hospital back of the firing lines in 
France, in a recent lecture before the New York 
Academy of Medicine demonstrated the harmful 
physiological effects, likely to develop into chronic 
maladies, produced in the human body by the acids 
generated by the intense emotions caused by war, 
both on and off the battlefield. 

The " Memoirs of M. Thiers, 1870-1873," trans- 
lated by Mr. F. M. Atkinson, which is announced 
for immediate issue in London, will contain a con- 
siderable amount of material not included in the 
original edition, privately printed in France, begin- 
ning with Thiers's letters from London in the 
autumn of 1870, during his tour of the European 
capitals in the hope of winning help among neu- 
tral nations in the war with Prussia. The memoirs 
close with M. Thiers's Presidency and the days of 
the Commune.

Readers of the Introduction to Professor Gilbert 
Murray's verse translation of the "Alcestis " of 
Euripides (recently published) will remember his 
reference to an illuminating monograph written 
by Mr. J. A. K. Thomson. This is now to be pub- 
lished by Messrs. George Allen & Unwin, Ltd., of 
London, under the title of " The Greek Tradition : 
Essays in the Reconstruction of Ancient Thought." 
The volume includes essays on " Greek Country 
Life," " The Springs of Poetry," "Alcestis and Her 
Hero," " Greek Simplicity," etc. 

Still another magazine devoted entirely to verse 
is soon to make its appearance. This latest comer 
is called " Contemporary Verse," and will be pub- 
lished at 203 Chestnut Ave., Chestnut Hill, Phila- 
delphia. Its first number, to appear in January, 
will contain contributions by Messrs. Hermann 
Hagedorn, Louis Untermeyer, Don Marquis, Rob- 
ert Haven Sehauffler, Joyce Kilmer, T. A. Daly, 
Leonard Bacon, William Rose Benet, Max East- 
man, and several others. The editors of " Contem- 
porary Verse" are Messrs. Howard S. Graham, Jr., 
Devereux C. Josephs, and Samuel McCoy. 

A fund of $50,000 for the purpose of maintain- 
ing in Throop College of Technology the Holder 
Chair of Biology has been established by friends 
of the late Charles Frederick Holder, who in this 
manner wish " to express their appreciation for 
his long labors in the realm of natural history, his 
steadfast devotion to sports in their most dignified 
and elevating sense, and his efforts to protect the 
wild game and fish of California." The knowledge 
that this tribute had been paid to him by his 
friends was a source of much satisfaction to Dr. 
Holder for several weeks before his death (which 
occurred on October 10). Had Dr. Holder lived 
he would have held the chair during the remainder 
of his life as Professor Emeritus. 

For a considerable time Messrs. Macmillan have 
had in preparation, and will shortly publish, their 
new and final edition of the " Short History of the 
English People," by J. R. Green. The original 
edition, which appeared in 1874, in which there 
had been inaccuracies of detail, was revised accord- 
ing to Mr. Green's special directions. In this 
work Mrs. Green had the advantage of Mr. Green's 
own corrections, and also in difficult questions the 
advice of the leading historians in their several 
departments, such as, for -example, Professor Gar- 
diner, Mr. Lecky, Lord Bryce, Bishop Stubbs, 
Bishop Creighton, and others. This final edition, 
now about to be published, includes an epilogue 
which continues the history to the present day. 

Sir Sidney Lee's rewritten and enlarged Life of 
Shakespeare will be published this month,- just 
seventeen years after the publication of the origi- 
nal work. The biography in its new form embod- 
ies much fresh information and illustrates from 
contemporary evidence the place that Shakespeare 
filled in both the literary and social life of his day. 
The organization of the theatres with which Shake- 
speare was associated is described in the light of 
recent research, and much space is devoted to the 
experiences of Shakespeare and his colleagues at 
the Courts of Queen Elizabeth and King James I. 
: Sir Sidney has consulted for the first time the wills 



of several of Shakespeare's Stratford friends, and 
has some new matter on the monument in Strat- 
ford Church. 

" The Blinded Soldiers' and Sailors' Gift Book," 
to which we referred at some length in our issue 
of Nov. 11, will be published on this side the 
water by Messrs. Putnam. The editor is Mr. 
George Goodchild, and the work will contain con- 
tributions from such prominent English writers as 
Messrs. Robert Hichens, John Galsworthy, Ed- 
mund Gosse, Eden Phillpotts, H. G. Wells, Austin 
Dobson, G. K. Chesterton, Anthony Hope, Gilbert 
Parker, and others. The contributions, in both 
prose and verse, were written especially for this 
book, and a number of artists have contributed the 
illustrations. The purpose of the volume, which 
is arranged as a gift book, is to add to the funds 
for the helping of English" soldiers and sailors who 
have been blinded in the war. 

Our Paris correspondent, Mr. Theodore Stanton, 
sends us the following letter which he lately re- 
ceived from Dr. W. A. Craigie, one of the editors 
of the great Oxford Dictionary: 

" The principal change in the Dictionary work caused 
by the death of Sir James Murray will be the loss of 
the sections done by himself and his staff, an impor- 
tant difference, naturally. The other editors and staffs 
have worked independently, and so are not directly 
affected. In fact the loss will partly be made up by 
the assistance to be obtained from Sir James Murray's 
staff, which will be all the more valuable as our num- 
bers have been somewhat reduced of late by the war 
and other causes. It is probable that attention will 
first be concentrated on finishing S, but either II or V 
will be in progress at the same time. 

"As Dr. Bradley is much older than either Mr. 
Onions and myself, and has been an editor since 1889, 
he will naturally be regarded as the chief representa- 
tive of the Dictionary. It is unlikely, however, that 
any formal statement on the question will be made. 

" Our chief American contributors in recent years 
have been Mr. Albert Matthews and Mr. C. W. Ernst, 
both of Boston, the former helping with American 
words, the latter chiefly with mediaeval Latin words 
and uses. I have also had some useful communica- 
tions from Mr. A. Bowski, of New York City, while 
Mr. C. O. S. Mawson, Springfield, Mass., has helped 
with Anglo-Indian words. The new 'American Glos- 
sary ' by Professor R. H. Thornton is also of great 
service in tracing the history of special words and 
phrases, as he has carried many of these much further 
than any previous collector. 1 '

THE PUBLISHER'S GREATEST PROBLEM 

is the problem of securing economical publicity for 
nis books. At trie cost of one page inlHE DIAL the 
publisher secures more (direct, efficient publicity 
than an expenditure of many times the amount will 
bring in mediums of general circulation. 




At the critical age of middle life 

To grow old gracefully! This is the hope of every man and woman at 
the critical age of middle life. To keep the mind fresh, the body active to 
keep from too-early "slowing up" with the weight of advancing years to be 
able to resist the attack of disease with the same certainty as in younger days 
this is the hope of the middle-aged. 

And here the kindly help of Sanatogen brings most gratifying results. Em- 
bodying purest albumen and organic phosphorus, Sanatogen is easily assim- 
ilated into the system; it feeds the depleted cells and tissues, restores energy, 
reawakens the appetite, and strengthens the organism so that it is better able to 
withstand the inroads of disease. 

Many indeed are those who, after using Sanatogen, can say with John. 
Burroughs, the venerable naturalist: 

"My sleep is 50 per cent. better than it was a year apo, and my mind and 
strength are much improved." 

Or with the Hon. Wm. E. Chandler, former Sec'y of the Navy, who writes: 

"Sanatogen is a pleasant nutriment for cases of impaired digestion. It 
strengthens without irritating and promotes vitality in feeble folks." 

Famous men and women almost without number have given grateful praise 
for the restorative aid of Sanatogen, and over 21,000 physicians after watch- 
ing it in their daily practice have written expressing their belief in Sanatogen. 
To guard against the pitfalls of advancing years, Sanatogen can be helpful 
also to you. 

Sanatogen is cold by good druggists everywhere from $1.00 up.

Mr. Lippmann makes a proposal in this book which might do away with the prime 
cause of international friction, by preventing the emotion of patriotism and questions 
of national prestige from becoming invc Ived in the protection of citizens and commercial 
interests in the backward places of the earth. 

"It is with exactly those questions which all of us are now rather 
anxiously asking ourselves that he grapples. By far his most logical, 
most coherent, best rounded book." Boston Transcript.

ETHEL M. COLSON in The Chicago Herald: 

Come, ye who seek unceasing a novel whose outlook is sane, whose sentiment savors

bear analysis, and whose faith equally escapes the abstruse and the subterranean, here is 
the balm in Gilead Dorothy Canfield's new story, "The Bent Twig. " The author, 
passionately American in spirit yet never narrow, has thought much, read widely and 
tasted, tested life from many angles both here and in Europe. Thus richly grounded,

the question of whether we are ordering our public 
affairs well or ill. The book's main purpose is to 
advocate a business administration for the govern-

Its pages fairly bristle with statistics, all carefully 
correlated to illustrate the different steps in the

THE NEW AMERICAN POETS 

OF OUR DAY 

Without a knowledge of the work of these new poets no real 
estimate can be made of America's contribution to contempo- 
rary literature. Better and truer than our novelists, they reveal 
and interpret the inner spirit of our national life. Young, vig- 
orous and fearless, they are the authentic voices of America. 



LINCOLN COLCORD 

His first book, recently published, has won for 
him a secure place among the truly representative 
American poets of today. In the same noble and 
understanding spirit in which Walt Whitman sang 
of the Civil War, Lincoln Colcord here sings of the 
greatest war in history. 

Vision of War 

"In this great poem Mr. Colcord has produced 
the most important piece of literature of the year. 
... .A national ode unequalled in its chastisement, 
its love and its hope." Boston Transcript. 
Cloth, $1.25. Leather, $1.50. 



THOMAS WALSH 

No lover and student of contemporary Amer- 
ican poetry can neglect the very important work 
of Thomas Walsh. His poems are the expression 
of a true artist, one who understands the power 
of simplicity and the subtle values of words. 

The Pilgrim Kings 

"The work of an artist with a great and sane 
philosophy of life." The Bookman. 

"A poet of fine substance and perfection of 
form." Boston Transcript. 

"Real color and music in these poems." 
N. Y. Times. 
Cloth, $1.25. Leather, $1.50. 



JOHN G. NEIHARDT 

With the publication of his new volume Mr. 
Neihardt establishes himself as a poet of remark- 
able gifts and ability. His work embodies a 
beauty and a power akin to the tremendous and 
impressive forces of nature with which it deals. 

The Song of Hugh Glass 

"An achievement of the highest order 

A big, sweeping thing, blazing a pathway across 
the frontiers of our national life." Boston Tran- 
script. 
Cloth, $1.25. Leather, $1.50. 



SARA TEASDALE 

Sara Teasdale's poems are considered by 
many to contain the purest song quality in Amer- 
ican poetry. Depth and simplicity go hand in 
hand through her work. To read her is to enter 
a world of music and color and to feel the pro- 
found beauty and the warmth of life. 

Rivers to the Sea 

"A book of sheer delight, filled with the joy 

of life self-revelatory as Mrs. Browning's 

'Sonnets from the Portuguese.' Her touch turns 

everything to song." Current Opinion. 

Cloth, $1.25. Leather, $1.50. 



EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON 

Many eminent critics call Mr. Robinson the 
foremost living American poet. His work has a 
genuine distinction and originality, a power and 
beauty that claim for him a dominating and last- 
ing place in American literature. 

The Man Against the Sky 

"Here is a man with something to say that 
has value and beauty. His thought is deep and 
his ideas are high and stimulating." Boston 
Transcript. 

Ready in February. 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS 

Mr. Masters has made the most striking and 
important contribution to American letters in 
recent years. He speaks with a new and authen-

ON THE EATING OF FERNSEED. 

Probably most of us have speculated on the 
advantages of being invisible. Mr. Wells has 
written a novel around the idea (around what 
odd idea has he not written a novel?), in 
which the blessedness of the state is not very 
apparent. To people of literary or artistic 
turn, however, a twilight condition of life 
seems almost a necessity. The butterfly's 
emblazoning dust brushes off against the hard 
hand of reality. Authors and artists have 
almost always preluded on some Magic Flute, 
even if afterwards they took up the ear-shat- 
tering trumpet that calls to strife. And their 
days of obscurity were probably their hap- 
piest, though they did not know it at the 
time. A king who goes about incognito is 
perhaps more pleased with himself than when 
he is glittering in his court; and he is cer- 
tainly a more potent figure to the imagina- 
tion. 

It is not necessary to go back "where 
Homer and where Orpheus are " to find great 
writers who passed their whole lives or a 
great part of their days in eclipse. What is 
now known about Virgil? A few scraps of 
biography we have, and one or two incidents 
touched with human interest, the reading of 
the passage about Marcellus to Augustus and 
the wish he expressed to have his epic burned, 
but otherwise the man is unilluminated. 
He moves majestic and mysterious, remote 
from the world in which he lived. Horace, 
that merry gossip, about whom we know 
everything, was his friend. There is no as- 
sumption of superiority or unlikeness to his 
fellows in Virgil ; he was simply an eater of 
fernseed, and could not become visible to 
them. Perhaps that is why the Middle Ages 
accounted him a magician, and why Dante 
chose him as a guide to the other worlds. 

But we have a nearer and greater instance 
of the eclipse of personality in Shakespeare. 
The odiously incredulous have denied that 
there was any such personality, or have 
sought to transfer it to another. On the 
other hand, critics have tried to piece out 
Shakespeare's character from the plays. It 
is probable that all creative artists do use 



592 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 23 



themselves as a model. Like Rembrandt, they 
keep a wardrobe of costumes and accesso- 
ries, helmets, swords, robes, and what not. 
When they wish to paint a certain sort of 
person, they don his habiliments and think 
themselves into his skin. But such vicarious 
enacting does not deeply dye their own be- 
ings. From the largeness of thought, vivid- 
ness of emotion, and generosity of feeling 
throughout Shakespeare's works, one may 
believe that he was a noble gentleman. Be- 
yond this it would hardly be safe to go. But, 
it may be said, have we not the record of an 
episode of his life in the Sonnets'? Perhaps! 
Personally, I should as soon think of going to 
market with the pieces of silver which the 
moon shining through a poplar tree coins 
upon the path at my feet, as to take literally 
and prosaically the words that any lyric poet 
utters in the whirl of his emotion and imagi- 
nation. He is like a Dancing Dervish who 
loses his own consciousness in the eternal. 
Doubtless he gets his start from some par- 
ticular experience, but it is his business to 
forget himself and reveal the universal. But, 
at any rate, Shakespeare's individuality is 
obscure; yet he, too, like Virgil, lived in a 
gossiping and malicious age. 

There is nothing uncertain about Milton. 
With ^Eschylus, Dante, Goethe, and Byron, 
he is one of the leaders of that other army 
of genius, whose personalities dazzle the world 
and dominate their times. But unlike most 
of these, he did not leap to the forefront 
of the struggle at once. For a good many 
years, in Italy or in Buckinghamshire, im- 
mersed in study and the strenuous idleness of 
dreams, he passed through a quiet paradise 
before emerging into his inferno. Doubtless 
the energy in him even then .struggled 
against the obscurity that smothered up his 
godship from surmise. Doubtless to his classic 
thought he was Apollo among the servants of 
King Admetus. But he was happy ; at least, 
the poems of that period, the '' Comus," the 
portraits of the bright and pensive Muses, the 
odes, though grave, are happy. It may be 
questioned if he ever knew happiness again. 
Of course the heroic struggler, scarred and 
defaced by intellectual battle, is the greater 
figure; of course the heroic epics and drama 
of his later life are the greater poetry; but 
nevertheless, we do not like him or them half 
as well. 



Keats's apprenticeship to obscurity lasted 
until death gave him his freedom papers. 
And toward the close of his life this obscurity 
was darkened by a perfect cloud of arrows 
directed against him, arrows of disease, of 
unfortunate love, of critical imbecility. Yet 
from it all he emerges the very image of youth 
and g*enius. Hardly any literary figure sym- 
bolizes these things as he does. His was the 
ecstacy of the fernseed life. He could live 
undisturbed with the visions of his own mind, 
fairies, nymphs, goddesses; he could con- 
sort with gay and irresponsible companions; 
he could be confident of the future and care- 
less of the day. His jaunts and junketings, 
his middle-class life in suburban parlors, 
struck Matthew Arnold as undignified. Hor- 
ace's poet who could go singing through a 
wood filled with robbers was probably undig- 
nified in comparison with a Roman Senator 
travelling with the impedimenta of place and 
riches, but he is more attractive. 

Keats's mantle, slipping off, fell at once 
upon Tennyson ; and for many years, twenty 
at least, the latter lived much the same sort 
of life as his predecessor. His education was 
better, and his family and friends were, ac- 
cording to English ideas, of a higher class 
than those of Keats. But Tennyson was 
apparently quite poor, often in real straits. 
Charles Eliot Norton reports on Carlyle's 
authority that FitzGerald allowed him three 
hundred pounds a year for many years. But 
there is certainly no trace of such incredible 
riches during his Wanderjahre. However, the 
record of this has never been fully drawn out. 
Apparently he wandered over the most of 
England, living in lodgings or in country inns 
or in friends' houses; settling now and then 
with his mother and sisters in retired places. 
His removed and solitary ways, his " grumpi- 
ness," his carelessness about dress, his absent- 
mindedness about other affairs of life, are all 
up to the best traditions of the fernseed 
world. Once the fate of " In Memoriam " 
hung upon Coventry Patmore's rescue of the 
manuscript from a lodging-house where Ten- 
nyson had left it. It was a rich twilight 
region of romance that the poet inhabited, 
where Marianas could really look from moated 
granges and Millers' Daughters rise out of the 
misty atmosphere of their homes. When 
Tennyson comes out into the common light of 
day, when he grows famous and rich, when 



1915' 



THE DIAL 



593 



princes and statesmen and bishops are his 
friends, the charm departs from his life, as 
it did to a large extent from his poetry. Yet 
to the last he remained the soldier of art, 
encamped amid his army of dreams, apart 
from the world. Could he have had his own 
way, we should know as little about his life 
or personality as we do about Shakespeare's. 

But I think the most signal instance of the 
fernseed life of which we have record is that 
of the Bronte girls in their Yorkshire par- 
sonage. A pillar of cloud hung over their 
home; they Avere almost as much isolated as 
if shipwrecked on a desert island. But what 
spiritual joys, what quiet exultations, must 
have been experienced in that household ! 
The whole genesis of creative art is in those 
imaginative " plays " which they worked out 
together or each one secretly by herself. One 
of the sisters got out a little into the world, 
met with disappointment and sorrow which 
she bravely overlived and made into art. The 
greatest of them remained alone and aloof, 
kept tryst only with the phantoms of her 
mind. She is the priestess of imagination, 
a Sibyl transported from Dodona to her 
Yorkshire moors. Remarkable or great as the 
work of these two is, it is less regarded by the 
world than the record of their lives. And 
rightly, for this latter brings out in the most 
intense and extreme degree the truth of 
Goethe's saying that " talent is nurtured best 
in solitude." 

There are some men of genius who, do w y hat 
they will, can never make themselves explica- 
ble or plain to the world. They are born 
invisibilities who may knock and flutter at the 
windows of our souls without gaining admit- 
tance. De Quincey, for example, lived among 
a set of men who were continually writing 
about themselves or each other. He was per- 
haps the greatest gossip of the group. He 
made " copy " about everything that hap- 
pened to him or everyone he came in contact 
with. His opium-eating confessions made him 
for a time the most stared-at person in En- 
gland. Yet with all this, there is an inviolable 
secrecy about him. We never seem to get at 
the real man. Perhaps he was a changeling, 
some elf-child may have been imposed into the 
human baby's cradle. Hawthorne is another 
of the mysterious ones. He, too, by means of 
diaries, note-books, records of travel, novels 
written around incidents in his life sought to 



explicate himself to mankind. But at most 
he only shows clear by flashes, like those 
twin stars, dark and bright, which revolve 
about one another. 

Keats suggests in one of his letters that 
genius ought not to have any personality at 
all, that it ought to be merely a medium 
through which the world exhibits itself. But 
the dazzling ones, the men of action and art 
together, the Angelos, Kubenses, Goethes, and 
Byrons, are geniuses too, so that law will 
hardly hold. Probably, though, the balance 
of great work is with the fernseed eaters, 
the creators who exist only in their art. 

Perhaps in the future genius may push the 
invisibility idea farther than it has done in 
the past. It may disguise itself by being like 
everybody else. It may be a burgess, may 
vote and be voted for. Meanwhile, in secrecy, 
in uncriticized seclusion, it may work out the 
documents of its fate, the title-deeds of its 
fame. These it may hide as though they were 
offences against mankind, until it dies, when 
it may leave them to be given posthumously 
to the world. Thus the artist will have all the 
fun of creation, and will not be hampered and 
hounded by the stupidity, hatred, and malice 
of his fellows. It is a fair ideal; and, if it 
had been put into execution in the past, would 
have saved very many of the greatest of 
human beings the larger part of their pain 
and suffering. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



LITERARY AFFAIRS IN PARIS. 

THE HOLIDAY BOOK SEASON. LITERATURE'S LOSS- 
ES IN THE GREAT WAR. PERIODICALS IN THE 
TRENCHES. M. PAUL FORT, THE " PRINCE OF 
POETS." 

(Special Correspondence of THE DIAL.) 

The holiday season for the publishing and 
bookselling world of Paris will be very dif- 
ferent this year, as it was also last year, from 
what is ordinarily the case. As a rule, fine 
new gift-books are issued by many of the 
leading houses, and old but favorite authors 
are given the place of honor in show-windows. 
The principal dailies and reviews contain not 
only conspicuous book advertisements but also 
columns and sometimes whole broadsides of 
critical and descriptive notices, in disguised 
form, really written by some member of the 
firm and paid for at so much the line. In 
the holiday season of 1914-15 there was a 
great falling off in all these things. Some of 
the smaller houses publishers, booksellers, 



594

and printers actually closed their doors, 
and not a few of these are still shut. But the 
situation this year is not quite so bad as it 
was last year, though it is far from being 
normal. These facts are well brought out by 
the special catalogue devoted to gift-books 
which the Paris Publishers' Club issues each 
winter at about this time. That for 1913-14 
the holiday season before the war contained 
356 pages; 4600 copies were printed; 1500 
francs' worth of copies were sold; over 
13,000 francs' worth of advertisements were 
inserted; seventy-three publishing houses 
were represented, and thirty-three periodicals 
printed therein their paid prospectuses. In 
1914-15 that is, four months after the 
breaking out of the war the number of 
pages of the catalogue had fallen to 119, only 
twenty-nine publishers participated, and but 
three periodicals felt able to advertise their 
existence. As I write this letter, the edition 
for this year is still in press; so I have not 
been able to continue this interesting com- 
parison. But the secretary of the club in- 
forms me that it will contain some forty 
pages more than last year, which, however, 
will leave it nearly two hundred pages short 
of what it was before the war. Of course this 
falling off is due in a measure to the fact that 
the public is spending its money now almost 
wholly on the necessities of life, and is not 
indulging in the buying of books. It is also 
to be partly accounted for by the effects of 
mobilization and the wounding and killing of 
so many of the younger generation. I have 
been struck by the number of printers seen in 
the hospitals. The head of the Hachette pub- 
lishing house said to me a month ago : " One 
of the things that seems to characterize the 
present struggle is the terrible mortality on 
the battle field. So far we have had fifty- 
four killed among our employes. In the war 
of 1870 we did not lose one. A friend of mine 
also in the publishing business has nine em- 
ployes in the army. Five have been killed 
and four wounded. You see me back in har- 
ness again, though I retired several years 
ago." A sign, however, of returning pros- 
perity is seen in the renewed activity among 
the bouquinistes along the parapet of the 
Quai Voltaire. At the moment of the battle 
of the Marne all their little boxes had the 
lids down and the contents removed to safer 
quarters. But the other afternoon when I 
passed that way, I noticed that almost all of 
them are now open again, and the same old 
habitues once more loitering over possible 
"finds." 

But a more permanent cause of the crip- 
pling of the publishing activities of France 



will be the cruel destruction which this war 
has occasioned among the young writers in 
every field of authorship, cut down often on 
the very threshold of their promise. This 
fact was brought home in a most touching 
way on All-Saints'-Day, at the beginning of 
this month, by the action of writers who form 
the society known as the Souvenir Litteraire, 
whose aim, the constitution reads, is " to ren- 
der homage to the memory of men of letters 
and especially to those who have been un- 
justly neglected." Artistic Paris always lends 
itself wonderfully to the artistic French tem- 
perament, if the word " art " may be used 
in connection with the subject which I am 
now treating; and never was this more so 
than on this occasion. M. Olivier de Gour- 
cuff, the talented founder of this admirable 
organization, was most happily inspired when 
he chose as the spot where the gray-haired 
living authors of Paris should honor their 
youthful confreres fallen in the defence of 
this same Paris, the head of the grand central 
alley of Pere Lachaise cemetery, where, with 
Bartholomews powerful funeral allegories 
the "Monument aux Morts" forming the 
immediate background, a solemn, patriotic 
tribute was paid to the more than one hun- 
dred and fifty rising writers now lost forever 
to literature. How fitting indeed was the 
frame for such a ceremony! As one walked 
up this avenue to the rendezvous, one re- 
marked on either hand brilliant reminders of 
the intellectual grandeur of France, for there 
are the tombs of Visconti the architect, Sainte- 
Beuve and Francisque Sarcey the critics, Cou- 
ture and Paul Baudry the painters, Victor 
Cousin and Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire the 
philosophers, Arago the astronomer, Ledni- 
Rollin the orator, Arsene Houssaye the typi- 
cal litterateur, and his son Henri Houssaye 
the historian, and last but of course not least, 
Alfred de Musset, the leaves of whose weep- 
ing-willow were still green, I noted, notwith- 
standing the sharp night air and the day 
mists of autumn. The spirit which pervaded 
the spot was so well expressed the next day 
by the poet Robert Lestrange, one of the 
actors in the scene his wife delivered in his 
name with marked talent a poem written for 
the occasion that I cannot give a better 
description than by quoting here what he 
said to me : 

"It is certain that this hecatomb will cause a 
terrible gap in the heart, of our young literature, 
for many a youthful and brilliant hope is thus 
blasted in its very flower. But we mourn them 
with a grief in which a certain feeling of pride is 
mingled, for they have written with their blood a 
most beautiful page of glory and they have shown 



1915]

themselves pure heroes. Yet it must not be con- 
cluded that French letters are in consequence 
irremediably impaired. For my own part, I be- 
lieve that after the war will rise up among those 
who are left a pleiad of writers strongly tempered 
in the virile school of adversity, those who, whether 
young or old, will have lived through these never- 
to-be-forgotten hours and who will surely be pre- 
pared to produce the finest works which can be 
conceived and executed. Iliads have inspired 
Homers, and ^Eschylus was a soldier at Marathon. 
This is the ransom of the fearful holocaust which 
the young literature of France must sacrifice to the 
ferocious German Moloch." 

And here are the names of some of these vic- 
tims which I select almost at hazard in the 
long sad list, led in my selection more by the 
family name than by the fame or the number 
of the dead author's writings. Here I meet 
again with Ernest Psichari, whom I first met, 
not so many years ago, as a bright young boy 
of scarcely eighteen, the grandson of Renan; 
Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu, whose father and 
uncle, now dead, were both members of the 
Institute ; Guy de Cassagnac, son of the once 
famous Bonapartist deputy; Claude Casimir- 
Perier, son of the former President of France ; 
Jacques Rambaud, son of the historian of 
Russia; Jean Maspero, related to the great 
Egyptologist, Georges Latapie, son of the di- 
rector of "La Liberte," and Robert d'Hu- 
mieres, descended from the marshal of that 
name, one of the favorites of Louis XIV. 

Most of these names appear in the little 
four-page "Bulletin des Ecrivains" which 
M. Fernand Divoire, of the " Intransigeant " 
editorial staff, has been editing for the past 
year. The aim of this diminutive monthly is 
excellent. A copy is sent gratis to all writers 
at the front; it keeps standing at the head 
of its first page a list of all those who are 
killed in battle or who die of wounds or sick- 
ness, it gives prominence to any military 
honors which they may have received, it pro- 
vides a list of authors in the enemies' prisons, 
and is useful in many other ways to the man 
of letters on the firing-line. In the latest 
number sent me by M. Divoire I read this 
notice: "As printed matter is no longer 
allowed to circulate postage free to the front, 
and as there is a constant demand for copies 
of our periodical, our expenses have consider- 
ably increased. We are now disposed, there- 
fore, to accept financial aid from writers in 
civil life, several of whom have already helped 
us. But we repeat once more that we will 
not accept money from writers in the army." 
"Would it not be a handsome thing if some of 
our American literary men and authors' clubs 
were to contribute to this admirable work, 
whose issues, I should add, are not on sale? 



If any of your readers wish to aid, they may 
send their contributions through me or direct 
to M. Divoire, 16 rue Bertin-Poiree, Paris. 

That there is a strong literary element in 
the French trenches is shown in still another 
way, and one that is not tragic but is even 
touched with a note of Gallic gaiety. A few 
months ago it was estimated that over sixty 
"newspapers" were issued by soldiers at the 
front. In fact, an energetic publisher, whose 
name M. Berger-Levrault I have already 
had occasion to mention in connection with 
this war literature, has just issued a curious 
volume, " Tous les Journaux du Front," 
(3 frs.), in which he gives facsimile extracts 
from twenty of these papers, which are some- 
times printed back of the firing-line but are 
often hand-made in the very trenches them- 
selves. The publisher announces that other 
volumes will follow. This one is interesting 
in many ways, and is a worthy example of 
native French wit, which if sometimes broad 
is always pointed. The names of two or three 
of these sheets will suffice to illustrate this 
fact. "Rigolboche," "Le Tourne-Boche," "La 
Voix du 75," and "L'Echo des Mannites," 
are not too bad. Nor should we overlook the 
more serious tone which pervades the mind of 
all these military journalists, and which is 
well exemplified by this extract from a letter 
which I have just received from Lieutenant 
Stephane Lauzanne, editor-in-chief of the 
Paris " Matin " and nephew of de Blowitz 
perhaps I may also add, whose wife is an 
American which he writes in English from 
the front: "We are quite prepared to pass 
the winter and the spring, and another winter 
and other springs if necessary ' pour avoir les 
Boches.' In fact, we have never been as de- 
termined as we are now. There is no doubt 
about the issue. We will gain at last, and 
civilization will gain with us." 

Another literary enterprise which should 
recommend itself to our men of letters is M. 
Paul Fort's " Poemes de France," a neat little 
four-page sheet issued twice a month and sent 
gratis to the intellectuals at the front and in 
the hospitals. Each number is made up of a 
series of patriotic poems written in the best 
style of the "Prince of Poets," and which 
Guitry and Suzanne Despres have been recit- 
ing everywhere in France, the latter carrying 
the good word even into distant Finland. But 
perhaps I should open a parenthesis here and 
say a few words about M. Paul Fort and his 
rather peculiar literary title. 

Those of your readers who would know 
more thoroughly the work of this original and 
brilliant poet should consult the article by 
Mr. Edmund Gosse in "The Edinburgh Re- 



596 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 23 



view" for last July, on "War Poetry in 
France," wherein the writer devotes special 
attention to these " Poemes de France," which 
he places first among the verse in this coun- 
try called forth by the present conflict. But 
a more complete article, which is wholly Driven 
up to M. Fort's poetry, if we except these 
"Poemes de France," came out in the Janu- 
ary number of " The Nineteenth Century and 
After," " Paul Fort, the ' Prince of Poets,' " 
by James Elroy Flecker. 

And this brings me to the explanation of 
a title which seems somewhat incongruous in 
the republic of letters in republican France. 
Some years ago " La Plume " and the " Echo 
de Paris" took the initiative in inviting the 
writers of France to designate their favorite 
poet. Some acted on the suggestion, and the 
poet thus specified was called the " Prince of 
Poets." He held office for life. The first 
incumbent was Paul Verlaine, who was fol- 
lowed by Stephane Mallarme, who in turn 
was succeeded by Leon Dierx, who died in 
1912. The last named I knew. He had the 
head of Leconte de Lisle as represented in the 
bust in the Luxembourg garden. He led a 
most austere life, his food being almost exclu- 
sively milk in the closing years of his ex- 
istence. His plain little flat in the region of 
Montmartre seemed chill even in summer, and 
he himself was exceedingly reserved. But 
perhaps the oddest thing in Leon Dierx's 
career was that, as "Prince of Poets," he 
should have been sandwiched in between two 
such eccentrics as Verlaine and Mallarme on 
the one hand and, on the other, by Paul Fort, 
who enjoys breaking over all the conventional 
rules governing poetry approved by this earn- 
est advocate of classic forms. But the election 
which designated Paul Fort had a broader 
basis perhaps than any of its predecessors. 
Some two thousand or more writers from all 
parts of France took part in the choice, which 
was conducted by such Paris papers as " Gil 
Bias," "Comoedia," 'TIntransigeant," and the 
" Paris- Journal," each one of which was rep- 
resented in the office of the first-named jour- 
nal when the votes were counted. " So while 
I do not at all over-estimate the importance 
of the office," M. Fort says very modestly, " I 
do feel that the electorate which designated 
me was fairly representative." 

I would like to try and depict the person- 
ality and the intellectual methods and quali- 
ties of Paul Fort, with his thick jet black hair 
cut square at the ends, capped with a heavy 
dark felt hat with broad brim and framed 
below with a sombre neckhandkerchief which 
hides the shirt front and leaves visible only 
a thin rim of the white of the collar, and all 



this encircling an olive-colored face with pierc- 
ing black eyes, the whole recalling one of those 
heads seen in Florence in the Renaissance. 
As he comes forward rapidly to greet you at 
his favorite rendezvous, La Closerie des Lilas 
what a poetic name for a cafe! in the 
Boulevard du Montparnasse and what a 
fitting locality! more than one stranger 
there looks up and follows with his eye for 
some time this uncommon figure. I would 
like to repeat here some of his expositions of 
his technique and explanations of his peculiar 
forms and ways of composition, but I have 
space left only to announce that these really 
notable "Poemes de France" are soon to be 
given a less fugitive dress, for on December 
15 they are to appear in book form. (Paris, 
Payot, 3 frs. 50), under the auspices of M. 
Anatole France. In fact the distinguished 
academician has given me permission to offer 
you his prefatory word before it has been 
printed here in the original French. It will 
suffice as an appreciation, from a peculiarly 
competent pen, of Paul Fort as a poet. 

" I have not waited, my dear fellow-author, the 
advice of friends to read your ' Poemes de France/ 
From the first number to the sixth, I am ac- 
quainted with these lyric war bulletins which 
should be engraved on tablets of bronze. I have 
admired their force and beauty and their elo- 
quence, now familiar, now sublime, rough some- 
times but always true and profound. You are a 
poet, you are a natural one. With you an idea is 
a spontaneous creation. It is born with its form 
like the works of nature. Your poems will live for 
the eternal opprobrium of Germany and the glory 
of France." 

I may add that the set of these sheets may be 
obtained from M. Fort at 125 Boulevard 
Saint-Germain, 6 francs for the twenty-four 
numbers covering the first year, December 1, 
1914, November 15, 1915. The second year 
begins with the number for December 1, and 
the issues will continue every fortnight.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



ONE OF WAR'S UGLIEST BY-PRODUCTS, as has 
often been noted, is the submersion of reason 
and intellect in the flood-tide of popular pas- 
sions. Mr. Galsworthy employed this theme to 
fine dramatic purpose in his tragedy entitled 
" The Mob," based on English feeling during 
the South African war. But in no conflict of 
the past has this sinister phenomenon ever 
attained the force and ascendancy that it has 
reached to-day in every belligerent country. 
The military rowdies who lately broke up a

meeting of the Union for Democratic Control 
in London merely typify the present spirit of 
Europe as manifested toward every individual 
who refuses to surrender his intellectual birth- 
right and join the general hue and cry. Mr. 
Bernard Shaw has remarked of his war writ- 
ings that " the British merely spit and gibe at 
me when they read the first sentence and find 
that it does not flatter the intolerable self- 
righteousness which has been our bane from 
the first day of this war." The same attitude 
is apparent in the German treatment of Dr. 
Liebknecht, and the French treatment of M. 
Holland. The latter, driven to Switzerland by 
the insults and abuse of his fellow-country- 
men, recently collected into a volume entitled 
" Au-dessus de la Melee " the papers published 
during the past year and a half in which he 
has nobly but vainly pleaded for the highest 
ideals of humanity. To this volume M. Hol- 
land has prefixed an Introduction which can- 
not be too widely quoted, and which will be its 
own excuse for the space we give it here. 
(For the translation, we are indebted to the 
New York " Times.") 

" A great people assailed by war has not only 
its frontiers to defend; it has its reason and con- 
science. It is imperative to save them from the 
hallucinations and the unjust and foolish notions 
that the plague of war lets loose. To each his 
office! Let the armies protect the soil of the 
country ; let thinking men watch over her thoughts. 
If these last place themselves at the service of the 
passions of their people, possibly they may be 
useful instruments; but they risk betraying the 
soul, which is not the smallest part of the national 
patrimony. Some day history will cast up the 
account of each of the nations in this war; she 
will weigh the sum of their mistakes, illusions, 
malignant folly. Let us do our utmost to insure 
that when we come before her our score may be 
small. 

" We teach a child the Gospel of Jesus and the 
Christian ideal. All the instruction he receives at 
school tends to stimulate in him the intellectual 
conception of the great human family. Classical 
education makes him observe, together with the 
differences of races, the common roots and trunk 
of our civilization. Art causes him to love the 
deep sources of the genius of the nations. Science 
imposes upon him faith in the unity of the intel- 
lectual life. The great social movement which is 
making the world over shows him around himself 
the organized effort of the working classes to unite 
in the hopes and in the struggles which are break- 
ing national barriers down. The most luminous 
geniuses of the world sing, as Walt Whitman and 
Tolstoy do, universal fraternity in joy or sorrow, 
or, like our Latin intellects, riddle with their criti- 
cism the prejudices of hate and ignorance which 
separate individuals and nations. 

" Like all the men of my time, I have been nour- 
ished on these ideals; I have tried in my turn to 



share the bread of life with my younger and less 
fortunate brethren. When war came I did not 
believe it my duty to renounce them because the 
hour for putting them in practice had arrived. I 
have been treated outrageously. I knew that I 
should be; but I did not know that I should be 
treated so without even being listened to. 

" I place before the eyes of every one the utter- 
ances which have been attacked. I do not defend 
them. Let them be their own defense. 

" I will add only one word. Within the last 
year I have found myself very rich in enemies. 
I have this to say to them: they may hate me; 
they will not succeed in making me hate them. 
My business is not with them. My task is to speak 
the words which I see to be just and humane. 
Whether that pleases or irritates is no concern of 
mine. I know that the words once spoken will 
make their own way. I sow them in a soil 
drenched with blood. I have full confidence in the 

harvest." 



THE FATE OF "NOTES AND QUERIES" still 
hangs in the balance. Suffering like many other 
periodicals from the withering blight now 
afflicting all the world, and Europe especially, 
this variously useful and curiously enter- 
taining publication has found itself strait- 
ened so seriously as to render its continued 
existence a matter of doubt, though the latest 
tidings from its editor give hope of continu- 
ance, but perhaps under other and it may be 
less favorable auspices. That is, it may be 
forced to migrate from its familiar haunts at 
the Athenaeum Press to new and less con- 
genial surroundings. Of course it desires to 
remain where it is. "Whether this shall 
prove possible," writes its editor to the Lon- 
don " Times," " depends upon the amount of 
practical financial aid which can be brought 
together for the purpose. "We can but com- 
mend the case to the literary men and general 
readers to whose service as its title sets 
forth 'Notes and Queries' was originally 
dedicated." From the same authoritative 
source we learn that the periodical was started 
on the third day of November, 1849, by 
"William John Thorns, who a few months be- 
fore had written to " The Athenaeum " a letter 
asking the editor to open his columns for 
the collecting of miscellaneous items of the 
sort now known as "folklore," a word in- 
vented by Mr. Thorns and there used for the 
first time. It was largely the cordial response 
to this suggestion that decided its author to 
launch his now famous publication upon the 
stormy sea that makes shipwreck of so many 
similar ventures. But this craft rode the 
waves triumphantly from the first ; it engaged 
at once the interest and aid of some of the 
foremost scholars of the time, and for sixty- 
six years its good fortune has not deserted it.

Its plan and scope made it appeal to both 
the serious-minded and the frivolous, to the 
scholar interested in the genuineness of the 
signatures to Charles the First's death war- 
rant, and to the casual inquirer into the origin 
of the term "pot-walloper." It has contrib- 
uted notably to the making of "The English 
Dialect Dictionary," " The Dictionary of Na- 
tional Biography," and the still uncompleted 
"Oxford Historical Dictionary." With so 
honorable a record behind it, and so fair a field 
of usefulness before it, " Notes and Queries " 
should have all the support it now asks for 
in its time of distress. 



PERPLEXING PROBLEMS FOR THE CATALOGUER 
are of every-day occurrence in any large li- 
brary, and among them is the recurrent ques- 
tion whether a given volume often it may 
be a gift to the library, and it may take the 
form of a musty collection of pamphlets un- 
systematically bound together is worth the 
careful analytical cataloguing imposed by 
modern rules. To leave the volume uncata- 
logued is practically to discard it from the 
library, which would grievously offend the 
donor, if it be a gift, and in any case would 
seem to the cataloguer an unpardonable dere- 
liction ; but to catalogue it properly and no 
slipshod work is to be tolerated in the modern 
American library might require a day's 
work, or even two days' work, and the writing 
of a hundred or more cards. It is the special 
library, oftener than the ordinary public li- 
brary, that has to confront situations of this 
sort. Mr. Frederick Warren Jenkins, of the 
Russell Sage Foundation Library, gives us in 
his current Report a hint of what it means to 
catalogue such a collection. He says : " Even 
on a conservative basis, fine analytics and 
many cards are necessary in the catalogue of 
the special library. As example : the number 
of cards made for four small sets may illus- 
trate : For the United States Report on Con- 
dition of Woman and Child Wage-Earners in 
19 volumes, 82 cards were made; for 4 vol- 
umes of the National Child Labor Committee 
publications, 375 cards ; for 8 volumes of the 
Russell Sage Foundation pamphlet publica- 
tions, 396 cards; and for 9 volumes of the 
New York State Charities Aid Association 
publications, 514 cards. A single book occa- 
sionally requires many cards to bring out its 
contents properly in the catalogue. The 
' Child in the City/ published under the aus- 
pices of the Chicago Child Welfare Exhibit, 
required 88 cards, while for Kelynack's 'De- 
fective Children' 82 cards were made. The 
number of analytics to be made is a difficult 
question to decide, and suggestions are always 



welcome." It would be of some interest and 
perhaps also of some practical value to have 
reports from cataloguers on their highest rec- 
ord for cards required by single volumes and 
by series or sets. Useful suggestions might 
accompany these reports.

THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY, planned 
for next April, when three hundred years 
will have passed since the poet's death, should 
be a nation-wide if not a world-wide success, 
unless the energies of the Drama League of 
America to that end have been misdirected. 
Shakespeare's own country seems likely to be 
engaged at that time in a sterner business 
than the presentation of pageants and the 
glorification of the Elizabethan age the 
more's the pity! and there is hence the 
greater reason why our people should exert 
themselves to signalize the occasion. In " Bul- 
letin No. 2 " issued by the Drama League are 
given all sorts of helpful suggestions for those 
planning Shakespeare celebrations; and gen- 
erous offers of further aid and advice are 
made to all interested. Inquiries may be ad- 
dressed to 736 Marquette Building, Chicago. 
On the subject of cooperation on the part of 
libraries, the Bulletin says that an extensive 
annotated bibliography and a similar smaller 
list are being prepared by the Library of 
Congress for the assistance of schools and 
clubs and societies planning celebrations, and 
continues : " In this connection the part to be 
played by libraries (to which many librarians 
are much alive) may be touched upon. Many 
will make a special feature of Shakespeare 
shelves and collections, providing in particu- 
lar for the use of schools the collections recom- 
mended in the bibliographies referred to. 
Some (e. g., Boston) will have courses of lec- 
tures by specialists ; some, exhibits of Shake- 
speareana." A national committee and a 
national memorial are among the interesting 
probabilities and possibilities touched upon 
in this notable Bulletin. 


THE HISTORY OP A LINCOLN MANUSCRIPT is 
made public for the first time in the preface 
to a small book containing the lecture on 
"Discoveries and Inventions" which Lincoln 
delivered in a number of Illinois towns, in- 
cluding Springfield, a short time before his 
election to the presidency. Mr. John Howell 
of San Francisco now puts this interesting 
address between the covers of a book, and 
publishes a "memorandum" concerning it 
from the late Dr. Samuel H. Melvin, into 
whose possession the autograph manuscript 
had come in the following manner : " In the

month of February, 1861, being at that time 
a resident of Springfield, Illinois, I called one 
evening at the residence of my friend, Dr. 
John Todd. The doctor was an uncle of Mrs. 
Abraham Lincoln. While there Mr. Lincoln 
came in, bringing with him a well-filled 
satchel, remarking as he set it down that it 
contained his literary bureau. Mr. Lincoln 
remained some fifteen or twenty minutes, con- 
versing mainly about the details of his pros- 
pective trip to Washington the following 
week, and told us of the arrangements agreed 
upon for the family to follow him a few days 
later. When about to leave he handed the 
grip above referred to to Mrs. Grimsley, the 
only daughter of Dr. Todd, who was then a 
widow but who subsequently became the wife 
of Rev. Dr. John H. Brown, a Presbyterian 
minister located in Springfield, remarking as 
he did so that he would leave the bureau in 
her charge; that if he ever returned to 
Springfield he would claim it, but if not she 
might make such disposition of its contents 
as she deemed proper. A tone of indescriba- 
ble sadness was noted in the latter part of the 
sentence." Five years later, after Dr. Melvin 
had taken part in escorting the dead Presi- 
dent's body to his old home, he called again 
at Dr. Todd's, was reminded of what seemed 
to have been a presentiment on Lincoln's part 
that he should not return alive to Springfield, 
and was invited by Mrs. Grimsley to select 
any manuscript he liked from the satchel 
above mentioned. His choice was the lecture 
now published by permission of his son, 
Judge Henry A. Melvin of the California 
Supreme Court, who is the present owner of 

the manuscript. 



ROMANCE OUTDONE BY REALITY is no new 
thing. An instance of inventive ingenuity 
that may make commonplace and wearisome 
the once amazing creations of Jules Verne's 
imagination is now claiming public attention 
perhaps more attention than it will pres- 
ently be found to have deserved. Mr. Nikola 
Tesla's alleged contrivance for projecting 
enormous volumes of electrical energy to a 
great distance without wires, and with un- 
paralleled destructive effect, eclipses the won- 
ders conceived by Mr. H. G. Wells in his 
earlier works of fiction, and makes tame that 
marvellous romance by Bulwer-Lytton, " The 
Coming Race," an astonishing piece of work 
in its day. Readers of F. Marion Crawford 
will recall the astounding things done with 
electricity by the hero of "With the Immor- 
tals." There, however, the vague and safe 
indefiniteness of fiction-writers' science left 
something to be desired in the way of con- 



vincing verisimilitude, whereas if the above- 
named invention is anything more than a 
newspaper fiction we shall ere long have some 
authentic facts and figures; and if the tre- 
mendous effectiveness of this new scheme for 
coast-defence be all that is rumored, the toils 
and troubles of those now so busy with plans 
for military preparedness will have been, for- 
tunately enough, so much misdirected energy. 
The command of a force so powerful as to 
make war an impossibility has long been the 
dream not only of romancers, but also of 
sober scientists and it may still continue to 
be a dream, or on the other hand some such 
happy consummation as that depicted in the 
late Simon Newcomb's remarkable romance, 
"His Wisdom the Defender," is not entirely 
inconceivable or impossible. 


STAIRCASE WIT, I' esprit de Vescalier, the apt 
repartee that comes to us too late, as we are 
going down the stairs, is possessed or may 
be acquired by almost everybody, whereas the 
flashing quickness of appropriate rejoinder 
that all would like to be masters of is some- 
thing born with one and impossible to acquire 
later. Nevertheless, education can do some- 
thing toward making a person fluent and 
graceful in conversation, and it can perhaps 
do still more toward giving him the mastery 
of a ready and skilful pen. Such, at least, 
seems to be the opinion of the writer of a 
rather curious little book that has just come 
to our attention. It is called "The Happy 
Phrase" and is further designated as "A 
Hand-Book of Expression for the Enrich- 
ment of Conversation, Writing, and Public 
Speaking." It is "compiled and arranged 
by Edwin Hamlin Carr," and further com- 
mends itself by bearing the imprint of the 
Putnam publishing house. A generous sup- 
ply of short phrases for the three purposes 
indicated on the title-page is to be found in 
the compact little volume, though the advisa- 
bility of their inclusion is not always beyond 
dispute. For instance, among the conversa- 
tional phrases, "It is a beautiful piece of 
industrial accomplishment " may well be out- 
side the unaided reach of the average person, 
but " Isn't that jolly? " and "A capital idea! " 
might safely be left to unassisted endeavor. 
For " Speech and Writing " the eye hits upon 
"An age crammed with war," " The policy of 
military unpreparedness," and " The patriot- 
ism of the common people," which have a 
certain timeliness ; and among " Happy Com- 
binations" we find "Exorbitant prices," 
" Rigid economy," " Hard facts," and " Shat- 
tered hopes," which also strike a responsive

chord. Mr. Carr believes his book to be a 
pioneer in its way, and in truth the volume 
does fill a niche that has hitherto been un- 
occupied. 



A " NATIONAL BOOK FORTNIGHT," described 
as " a national campaign to widen the circle of 
book-buyers," was recently engineered with 
considerable success by the English Publish- 
ers' Association. During the two weeks from 
November 22 to December 4, the eve of the 
great book-buying season of the year, the Lon- 
don and provincial press printed daily columns 
of special book matter supplied by the Asso- 
ciation and consisting of original articles by 
Mr. H. G. "Wells, Mr. Arnold Bennett, Mr. 
A. C. Benson, and other well known writers; 
and classified lists of the season's books were 
included. An elaborate and imposing Christ- 
mas catalogue, specially prepared for this 
purpose, was distributed by the local book- 
sellers. "Although the war has not affected 
the book market so disastrously as many people 
anticipated," says the London "Times," "it 
has nevertheless added heavily to the handicap 
of an ancient trade which has been struggling 
against adverse circumstances for many years 
past. It has served also to emphasize the 
truth of the familiar words of Felix Dahn, who 
said : ' To write a book is a task needing only 
pen, ink, and paper ; to print a book is rather 
more difficult, because genius often expresses 
itself illegibly ; to read a book is more difficult 
still, for one has to struggle with sleep. But 
to sell a book is the most difficult task of all.' " 



CARNEGIE INSTITUTION PUBLICATIONS are 
properly valued and made good use of at 
most of the three hundred and twenty larger 
libraries where they are regularly received as 
gifts, twenty or thirty substantial volumes 
being thus sent yearly to each beneficiary. 
But now and then a library thus favored is 
found to be remiss either in promoting the 
usefulness of these gifts or in acknowledging 
them, or in both particulars ; and such negli- 
gence brings its proper penalty in the drop- 
ping of that library's name from the list. 
The current Report of the President of the 
Institution devotes some space to this subject 
and to the general method observed in the 
sending out of its publications. With justice 
it is maintained that no such indiscriminate 
free distribution as is often requested by the 
unthinking is financially possible even to so 
well-endowed an association. " Its entire 
income would be insufficient to meet" such 
demands, declares the President. But, he 
adds a little later, "to meet the needs of 



special societies and of individuals, as well as 
of certain establishments, like the British 
Museum, which quite rationally prefer to 
purchase publications instead of receiving 
them gratuitously, all of the Institution's pub- 
lications are offered for sale at nominal 
prices, which are only just sufficient to cover 
the cost of bookmaking and transportation to 
purchasers." At present the Institution has 
on hand about 126,000 volumes of its publica- 
tions, and the collection is valued at nearly 
$237,000. 



THE AUSTRIAN INDEX LIBRORUM PROHIBITO- 
RUM, one of the by-products of the great war, 
has been steadily increasing from the begin- 
ning, seventeen months ago, and is said now 
to include several hundred works, large and 
small. As samples of what is considered per- 
nicious literature by the authorities at Vienna 
we quote the following titles from a late num- 
ber of the "Amtsblatt," the official journal of 
the government: "Berlin to Bagdad: New 
Aims of Central European Politics," by Dr. 
von Wirdstettin : " My Adventures as Spy," 
by Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Baden- 
Powell; "The Life of Jean Jaures" (author 
not given); "Para Pacem" (anonymous); 
"The Awakening," published by a patriotic 
Czech Association in Vienna; a postcard 
with the Pope's " Call to Peace " printed on 
the back. One of these books at least, Sir 
Robert Baden-Powell's spy adventures, is ex- 
tremely interesting reading, as we chance to 
know ; if the others are equal to it, the list is 
worth keeping for future use when an anti- 
dote to ennui is desired. 



"OLD NASSAU," Princeton's famous song, 
comes into passing public notice at this time 
by reason of the death of its composer, Pro- 
fessor Karl A. Langlotz, of Trenton, N. J., at 
the age of eighty-two. He had in his day 
been professionally associated with many of 
the world's leading musicians and composers, 
and had formed one of the orchestra led by 
Wagner when " Lohengrin " was for the first 
time presented at Weimar. He held his 
famous Princeton melody in but light esteem, 
though fifty-four successive classes of Prince- 
tonians have sung it with enthusiasm and 
paid due tribute of honor to its composer. 
The words of the song were the inspiration of 
Harlan Page Peck, of the class of 1862, and 
there are few American college songs written 
by undergraduates that equal it in fame and 
age. Dr. Washington Gladden's well-known 
Williams song, "The Mountains" both

words and music being his work antedates 
" Old Nassau," as Dr. Gladden is a '59 man 
and the song was a student performance, as he 
has pleasantly related in his autobiography. 



BIBLES AND BOMBS, linked in ironical part- 
nership, are at present conspicuous among the 
products manufactured in and exported from 
this country, to the no inconsiderable profit 
of the manufacturers and exporters. That 
danger and death should create a demand for 
books of devotion is easy to understand ; and 
that the countries now involved in war should 
be unable to supply this demand is not to be 
wondered at; but that the abnormal activity 
of the munitions-factories should tend to 
speed up the printing presses of the B\ble- 
houses, with resultant profits of a magnitude 
not unwelcome to the latter, is a curious devel- 
opment out of the terrible tangle in which the 
whole world moral, industrial, commercial, 
financial, social, and even religious has be- 
come so inextricably involved. The sailing 
ships that used to clear from the port of 
Boston for heathen lands, with missionaries in 
the cabin and Bibles and Medford rum in the 
hold, were freighted incongruously enough; 
but a cargo of scriptures and shells is worse. 



A NEW SUGGESTION IN LIBRARY-BUILDING 

comes from California, the pioneer State in 
more than one library movement. In the cur- 
rent quarterly issue of " News Notes of Cali- 
fornia Libraries " is printed a brief paragraph 
from a San Francisco journal, as follows: 
"As the city has decided to use the municipal 
railway earnings to buy the library bonds, 
work on the building has been resumed. The 
sale of the library bonds has been slow because 
of the low interest." Thus the San Francis- 
can who boards a street-car to take him to the 
library in quest of a book both gets his ride 
for his nickel and at the same time helps to 
provide funds for completing the library 
building accomplishing two worthy objects 
with one coin, which is infinitely more praise- 
worthy than killing two birds with one stone. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

SHAKESPEAEE AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
There has always been considerable fascination 
for me in the following brief passage from one of 
the less popular of Shakespeare's great tragedies 
(" Coriolanus," 1.9,79-92): 

" Mar. The gods begin to mock me. I, that now 

Eefus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg 
Of my lord general. 



" Com, Take't ; 't is yours. What is't ? 

" Mar. I sometime lay here in Corioles 

At a poor man's house ; he us'd me kindly. 
He cry'd to me ; I saw him prisoner, 
But then Aufidius was within my view 
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you 
To give my poor host freedom. 

" Com. Oh, well begg*d ! 

Were he the butcher of my son, he should 
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus ! 

" Lar. Marcius, his name? 

"Mar. By Jupiter, forgot! 

I'm weary; yea, my memory is tir'd. 
Have we no wine here? " 

Why did Shakespeare introduce into one of the 
longest of his plays such an apparently trivial 
incident as his hero's begging for the life of a 
prisoner whose name he had forgotten? Most of 
the editors and commentators point out the fact 
that Shakespeare found this incident in his origi- 
nal, in North's translation of Plutarch. Deighton 
regards the occurrence as an indication of Corio- 
lanus's " tenderness of heart." Gervinus refers to 
it as an indication of one of the " good " traits in 
the hero's character, a " fit of feeling in a god 
of stone." As far as I can find, only one editor 
F. A. Marshall, in the " Henry Irving edition " of 
Shakespeare, has noted the fact that the drama- 
tist departed from "his original" in making 
Coriolanus forget the name of one who had for- 
merly shown him hospitality. Reference to Plu- 
tarch's Life of Coriolanus shows that the poet did 
depart from history in the matter referred to. 
Plutarch does not, it is true, give us the name of 
the Volsce whom Coriolanus recognized in the 
heat of battle, and whose liberation he would have 
demanded had not at that moment his pity been 
overwhelmed by wrath at the sight of his great 
enemy Aufidius. But neither is there anything 
in Plutarch to lead one to infer that Coriolanus 
did not remember the name of his benefactor. 
Assuming and it is an assumption that we have 
every right to make that so skilful an artist as 
Shakespeare knew what he was about when he 
adopted anything from his sources and that he did 
not reject or retain anything hap-hazard, it be- 
comes an interesting question why he departed 
from Plutarch in this particular incident. It will 
be noted that Marcius attributes his defect of 
memory to fatigue (" I'm weary; yea, my memory 
is tir'd"). But it can hardly be believed that 
Shakespeare meant to tell us no more than that 
his hero was tired after the exploits of the day. 
The stirring speech that Coriolanus delivers before 
his General, and his demeanor throughout the 
scene after the battle, contradict his theory of 
mental fatigue. Besides, fatigue cannot obliterate 
the names of our friends and benefactors from 
our memory. Why, then, does Shakespeare, while 
following his original so closely as to expose him- 
self to the charge of plagiarism, depart from it in 
such an apparently trivial matter as the remem- 
bering of the name of an insignificant Volscian? 
That Shakespeare did so is sufficient proof that 
the matter is not trivial, is not insignificant. To 
me whatever is in Shakespeare's great works is

right, poetically, dramatically, and psychologi- 
cally. I am convinced that there is no more inter- 
esting or instructive way of studying a great 
artist than to see him at work, in the act of crea- 
tion, as he is remolding his crude original and 
giving it the breath of life. The little episode we 
are now considering affords us an opportunity to 
see Shakespeare at work. 

The question we have to consider is why does 
Coriolanus forget the name of his sometime b>st? 
It is evident that he expected to remember the 
name and that he is chagrined at having forgotten 
it ("By Jupiter, forgot!"). Can we explain this 
occurrence? and what, if any, is its significance? 
Thanks to the " new psychology " of Professor 
Sigmund Freud, these questions can be answered 
without much difficulty. 

It is one of the fundamental principles of this 
new psychology, the only psychology deserving the 
name, that nothing in the domain of mental 
phenomena happens " by chance," that all our 
thoughts and actions even the most apparently 
insignificant ones are determined by complex 
psychic processes. Just as there is no effect with- 
out an adequate cause in the physical world, so 
there is no " accident " in the psychic world. I illus- 
trated this principle (the law of psychic determin- 
ism) some time ago in a short essay dealing with 
Dr. Rank's discovery of what he believed to be a 
slip of the tongue in " The Merchant of Venice." 
It was there shown that every so-called " slip " of 
the tongue has a meaning. Such a slip is really 
only a slip of the attention, of the person's ability 
to keep to himself what is going on in his mind. 
The censor or guardian that watches over the 
unconscious ego and stands between it and the 
conscious personality has been caught napping, 
and one of our secrets has escaped from its cell 
and broken through the lines into the realm of 
consciousness. The person guilty of the slip may 
not be aware (i. e., may not be conscious) of the 
intruding idea and may not know the meaning of 
the slip, but that it has a definite meaning is cer- 
tain and may be discovered by the process known 
as psychoanalysis, or soul analysis. Now, the 
failure to recollect a name or word that one ought 
to remember and expects to remember is nothing 
but a slip of the memory, and is not accidental. 
It is due to some unconscious motive, i. e., to a 
motive of which the individual is not at the time 
conscious. Our unconscious personality is always 
true to us; it is franker, sincerer, and honester 
than our conscious ego, alas! our "normal" 
selves. It is true that our unconscious personality 
is selfish, without a touch of altruism, and un- 
moral; but it is always true to us and to our 
interests. The unconscious ego seeks, above all, to 
avoid every unpleasantness, to exclude from con- 
sciousness any idea that may give the individual 
displeasure. It is only when the censor is asleep 
or napping that our selfish or wicked desires slip 
their leash and force an entry into the forbidden 
domain presided over by culture and civilization 
and hypocrisy. In most instances, however, they 
do not pass the censor in their true shape, but 
enter consciousness in some disguise. Conse- 



quently, the individual, the conscious ego, the 
host, is but rarely aware of the true character 
of his uninvited guests. That is why it is such a 
difficult task to know oneself. The ancientest 
philosopher of whom we have any record spoke 
wiselier than he knew when he formulated the 
fundamental maxim of his philosophy in the 
words: Know thyself! How difficult a task this 
is can be appreciated only now since the revela- 
tions of the new psychology are showing us what 
a filmy veneer over the true personality is the part 
of ourselves that we present to the view of the 
work-a-day world. To see ourselves as others see 
us would indeed bring us a little nearer to self- 
knowledge, but only a little. The poet would per- 
haps have sung truer had he prayed for the gift 
to see ourselves with the eyes with which we see 
others. But we cannot know others until we know 
the inmost part of ourselves, our unconscious 
selves. 

But let us return to the consideration of lapses 
of memory. It must be borne in mind, however, 
that we are dealing only with the forgetting of 
those names which the individual ought to remem- 
ber and expects to remember, and the forgetting 
of which is accompanied with disappointment. 
Such a forgetting is really a failure on the part 
of the function of memory; it is not a passive 
dropping from the memory, but an active expul- 
sion from the memory. It is now well established 
that just as we can concentrate our mental ener- 
gies to recollect something so we can concentrate 
those energies in the effort to forget what is pain- 
ful and disagreeable. This voluntary and pur- 
posed forgetting of our painful experiences, ideas, 
and desires, is called " Repression." But, alas ! 
the repressed matter is not always content to lie 
dormant; it takes advantage of every oppor- 
tunity to escape from confinement, to enter into 
association with the rest of our psychic life, to 
influence our conscious life and to give vent to the 
emotion associated with it. It is this partial fail- 
ure of repression that is responsible for what the 
Germans call Fehlhandlungen, an expression for 
which the English language has no equivalent. 
By Fehlhandlungen we mean such acts as slips of 
the tongue, slips of the pen (miswriting), certain 
printer's errors, mislaying objects, lapses of mem- 
ory, mishearing, misreading, misrecognition, and 
many still more complicated mental and physical 
acts, e. g., accidentally letting something fall, for- 
getting to carry out resolutions, throwing a stone 
and " accidentally " hitting someone with it, etc., 
etc. To the uninitiated these assertions may seem 
ridiculous; but let any skeptic submit himself to 
a psychoanalysis and their truth will be demon- 
strated beyond the shadow of a doubt. 

We all feel flattered when an eminent personage 
remembers our name, especially if he had met us 
only once or twice and not under peculiarly favor- 
able conditions. It is as though the great man 
said to us : " You are of sufficient importance 
to have me remember your name." On the other 
hand, we all feel some resentment and humiliation 
when we find that our name has been forgotten by 
a person of some importance or by one who we

think ought to remember us. This explains, too, 
the comic effect produced on the stage and in books 
when the name of one of the characters, usually 
the " villain," is distorted every time it is spoken. 
Shakespeare has noted, in "King John," that 
" new-made honour doth forget men's names." 

From what Coriolanus says " he used me 
kindly," and from what we know of him, his 
profession, his valor, and his hostility to Aufidius, it 
seems that at some time he found himself hemmed- 
in in Corioli and that he owed his escape to the 
friendly shelter of the resident whose name he had 
forgotten. It might occur to someone to ask at 
this point : " If Shakespeare followed Plutarch so 
accurately in this matter why should there be any 
doubt about this? Was Coriolanus indebted to 
the Volscian and for what? " The answer to these 
questions not only contains the answer to our 
main query (why Coriolanus forgot the name) 
but furnishes a striking and extremely interesting 
illustration of Shakespeare's method of work. Let 
us say at once that, notwithstanding the assertions 
of the editors and commentators, Shakespeare did 
not slavishly follow Plutarch, but changed what he 
found in accordance with his insight into the souls 
of men and the requirements of his stage. That 
the reader may judge for himself, I transcribe the 
following from Plutarch: " Only, this grace (said 
he) I crave and beseech you to grant me. Among 
the Volsces there is an old friend and host of 
mine, an honest wealthy man, and now a prisoner; 
who, living before in great wealth in his own 
country, liveth now a poor prisoner, in the hands 
of his enemies." 

Be it noted that in Plutarch the Volscian is " an 
honest [honorable] , wealthy man " and " an old 
friend" of Coriolanus. Shakespeare makes him 
" a poor man " who had befriended Coriolanus in 
a time of need. It now becomes apparent, if we 
bear the character of Coriolanus in mind, why the 
Volscian's name was forgotten. He was a poor 
man, a plebeian, and it galled Coriolanus to think 
that he the haughtiest and the valiantest of the 
aristocrats of Rome was beholden to one of the 
common people. The poor Volscian's name would 
have suggested his plebeian origin, and would have 
awakened Coriolanus's inveterate resentment for 
the many-headed and rank-scented multitude 
against whom he can never cease railing. Corio- 
lanus's contempt and prejudice are so deep-rooted 
that he is blind to every spark of goodness in the 
common people. 

The introduction of Coriolanus's failure to recall 
the Volscian's name is one of those subtle and 
magical touches of which none but Shakespeare 
was capable. The common soldiers, the aristoc- 
racy and the generals are, for the time being, 
enamored of the hero of Corioli; his weaknesses 
are forgotten; his titanic pride, his egoism, his 
impetuosity, and his contempt for the people are 
overlooked. Instead of these, they and we see 
only his valor, his honor, his dignity, his physical 
prowess, his fearlessness, his filial love, his domes- 
tic virtues, his lofty mind, his brilliant leader- 
ship. To crown all these, the poet shows us his 
hero's freedom from avarice (in refusing princely 



gifts), his gratitude for benefits received and bis 
gracious condescension in remembering a com- 
moner. Coriolanus's renunciation of more booty 
than what he considers his just share, his generous 
tribute to the many " without note," his modesty, 
etc., as shown in Act I, and especially in this 
scene, are well calculated to make us even the 
spectators forget the hero's weaknesses. To 
guard against this the dramatist ends the scene 
the act, we may say with a subtle reminder of 
the protagonist's tragic failing his hatred and 
scorn of the people. Even at the climax of the 
portraiture of Coriolanus's better parts, the poet 
gives those who have the eyes to see a glimpse of 
his one great weakness. The little slip of the mem- 
ory is psychologically and dramatically determined.

A STRANGE VISITOR IN " THE CITY OF 

DREADFUL NIGHT." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It may be a matter of surprise to your readers, 
as it dumfounded me, to learn that James Thom- 
son ("B. V.") is the author of an interesting 
tribute to Frangois Rabelais. The essay, reprinted 
in " Biographical and Critical Studies," was writ- 
ten, perhaps as a pot-boiler, for Cope's " Tobacco 
Plant." We get a hint of this origin in the 
author's regret that the great abstractor of quin- 
tessence died before making the acquaintance of the 
" herb of herbs, which is tobacco. Had time and 
fortune but made him acquainted with it," con- 
tinues Thomson, "we may be sure that tobacco 
and not vile hemp, would have been recognised by 
him as the herb Pantagruelion." 

The first, biographical part of the essay is of no 
value. It is based too much on the Rabelaisian 
legend which modern research has destroyed, but 
the second part is an amazingly sympathetic ap- 
preciation of the work of Rabelais. We may or 
may not regret that the sombre poet of " The 
City of Dreadful Night" did not imbibe more 
deeply of the Pantagruelian philosophy, " cer- 
taine gayete d'esprit conficte en mespris des choses 
fortuites," but at least it is pleasant to find 
good evidence that the reading of Rabelais brought 
him some hours of gaiety. 

We think of Thomson as one continually 
wrapped in gloom, who had left behind all hope 
and joy at the gates of the nocturnal city which 
for him was life. Yet he could see more than one 
side of the shield. "Profound thought and crea- 
tive genius may wear a riant not less than a tragic 
face, or, in some instances, the one and the other 
in alternation; and there are even instances in 
which one-half the mask has been of Thalia and 
the other of Melpomene; for wisdom and genius 
are not necessarily, though they are more fre- 
quently, grave. Democritus the laugher seems to 
have been a philosopher yet more subtle than 
Heraclitus the weeper . . and Aristophanes^ I 
suppose, had at least as much imaginative genius 
as Euripides." 

As bits of well-phrased and effective criticism, I 
may cite the following. Contrasting the satire of 



604 



THE DIAL 



[ Dec. 23 



Swift and Rabelais, Thomson says : " Both see 
with a vision that cannot be muffled through all 
the hypocrisies and falsehoods, all the faults and 
follies of mankind ; but the scorn of Rabelais rolls 
out in jolly laughter, while the scorn of Swift is a 
saeva indignatio the one is vented in wine, the 
other in vitriol." Again, speaking of the inex- 
haustible exuberance of the Frenchman's vocabu- 
lary, he says : " I remember reading somewhere 
of two Oxford or Cambridge professors discussing 
whether Shakespeare or Milton had the greater 
command of language, when one remarked con- 
clusively: 'Why, in half-an-hour Shakespeare 
would have slanged Milton into a ditch ! ' I take 
it that Rabelais would have slanged Racine into a 
ditch in about five minutes." I have rarely seen 
a more Gargantuan blow dealt to French classi- 
cism, which, when it deigned to speak of Rabelais 
at all, treated his book as an inexplicable enigma. 
Possibly Thomson was thinking of Rabelais 
when he wrote in his " Proem " : 

" O antique fables ! beautiful and bright, 
And joyous with the joyous youth of yore; 
O antique fables! for a little light 
Of that which shineth in you evermore, 
To cleanse the dimness from our weary eyes, 
And bathe our old world with a new surprise 
Of golden dawn entrancing sea and shore."

BOOKS IN JAPAN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The following paragraphs from the "Japan 
Times " of October 13 will serve to give an idea 
of what Japan reads. The " publication market " 
mentioned therein is a yearly affair. 

" The result of the publication market in autumn 
is the barometer as to what books are favoured by the 
people in this country. This season at the Tokiwa- 
kadan Restaurant, Uyeno, for four days between the 
7th and llth inst, 184 publishers of the Tokyo Pub- 
lishers' Guild placed their publications on the market. 
Over 300 booksellers are reported to have come up 
from Formosa, Korea, Manchuria, and the Loochoo 
islands as well as from various parts of Japan proper 
to enjoy the benefits offered by the market. The sale 
for four days totalled some 170,000 yen [$85,000], 
of which such leading publishers as the Maruzen, 
Hakubun-kan, Okura, Eikugo-kan, and Fuzanbo se- 
cured each more than ten thousand yen [$5,000]. 

" Publications dealing with popular science have 
enjoyed the keenest demand; next come those relating 
to popular history and geography; and the linguistic 
literature and dictionaries, especially the German- 
Japanese Dictionary by Prof. Tobari, have expe- 
rienced a warm welcome. That the German-Japanese 
Dictionary has increased in favour may be due to the 
European war. 

" So-called small series editions and detective sto- 
ries have seen their day and are now not found even 
on the auction list. Novels and romances are quite 
unpopular. As for the works of Mr. Eabindranath 
Tagore, the keen demand for them ceased with the 
confirmation of the rumour that he would give up his 
intended visit to this country." 

I should also like to call attention to a monu- 



mental work now approaching publication, as 
described in the " Japan Times " of October 21. 

"Every country in Europe has a trustworthy, 
exhaustive dictionary of its language, but it is a 
matter of great regret that Japan has not been bene- 
fited by such an acquisition. This inconvenience will 
be removed by the ' Japanese Lexicon ' which has 
passed all stages of compilation, thanks to the 15. 
years' assiduous application of Prof. Uyeda of the 
Tokyo Imperial University and Prof. Matsui of the 
Tokyo Higher Normal School. This invaluable work 
will be published in four volumes, the first having 
already passed the last proof-reading, while the other 
three volumes will be issued within three years from 
next year. 

"Last Tuesday evening a dinner was given in the 
Seiyoken, Uyeno, in honour of the two scholars by 
their friends. The function was attended by Premier 
Count Okuma, Barons Kikuchi and Goto, Dr. Takata,. 
Minister of Education, Vice-Minister Ishihara of the 
Household Department, and some 150 distinguished 
scholars and educationists. 

" Minister Takata paid a glowing tribute to the 
guests of honour, emphasising the fact that there has 
been hitherto no reliable dictionary of the Japanese 
language, especially for foreign students, but that 
the new dictionary by the two scholars will efficiently 
fill up the gap. 

" Then followed the Premier's address, in which he 
recounted that the first dictionary compiled in the 
Orient was that completed in the reign of the Chinese 
Emperor Shih, its vocabulary, however, containing 
only 1,200 words. The Kanghsi Lexicon, an authori- 
tative Chinese dictionary, was compiled in the early 
stages of the Ching dynasty and comprised some 
70,000 words. The new Japanese Dictionary by Profs. 
Uyeda and Matsui is exhaustive, treating 220,000 
words. Its Mss. are 140 ft. high. The perseverance 
and energy of the Professors are entitled to the high- 
est praise, concluded the Premier."

AN INTERESTING PROPHECY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Among those of your readers as keenly inter- 
ested as I in Professor Showerman's delightful 
I am tempted to say, delicious review of 
" Modern Painting," by Mr. Willard Huntington 
Wright, in your issue of Nov. 25, there may be 
some who are unacquainted with, or who have 
forgotten, the sentences with which Mr. Birge 
Harrison closes the fifth chapter of his book on 
" Landscape Painting " : 

" When I try to draw aside the veil, and peer into 
the mists of the future, I seem to see another art, less 
material, more akin to the pure spirit of music; an 
art stripped of all that is gross and material; an art 
in which abstract beauty alone shall rule. In this new 
art values may very possibly be unnecessary, and all 
will be stated in terms of beautiful color. 

" This is not yet, however ; and any art which is to 
endure must be true to the spirit of its own age." 

This prophecy was uttered five years ago. There- 
are few, Mr. Wright's " Modern Painting " to the 
contrary, who believe the prophecy realized at this 



time.

EXEGI MONUMENTTJM: RUPERT BROOKE.* 

"The real artist, who knew what he was 
imitating, would be interested in realities and 
not in imitations ; and would leave, as memo- 
rials of himself, works many and fair; and, 
instead of being the author of encomiums, he 
would prefer to be the theme of them." These 
words of Plato, true at all times, were never 
more evidently true than now. To write 
poetry, to think about poetry when half the 
world is in the agony of dissolution; when 
men to whom life looks as fair and tastes as 
sweet as to us face death hourly with a smile ; 
when what we have known as civilization 
seems to be reeling back to the barbarism 
whence it sprang, and we know not what new 
earth may at last emerge from the chaos over 
which the powers of darkness and not the 
Spirit of God are moving; to deal with 
poetry at a time like this, we feel and justly 
feel, requires an apology. It will evidently 
be no "idle singer of an empty day" that 
can engage us at such an hour. It will be 
poetry that is sincere and profound, that 
expresses what our life veritably is poetry, 
in a word, that is real. And even such poetry 
may be postponed to happier days, days less 
urgent, less solemn, on whose fortune hang 
less vital issues. But if, in our search for 
something that will distract our minds for an 
instant from the horrors that obsess them, we 
should come upon noble poetry which has 
been translated into heroic deed, upon this we 
may dwell without accusing thoughts. "This," 
we say, "is suited to the hour." And such 
poetry we find in the verse of Rupert Brooke. 
Here is a monument not of song only, but of 
glorious act, and not of act only, but of 
sacred song. Here is an artist who was " in- 
terested in realities, not in imitations," and 
has left behind him, as memorials of himself, 
works, not indeed many, but very fair. 

The brief record of the poet's life is by this 
time well known. Born into a cultivated 
family, endowed with unusual physical beauty 
and charm, trained in the best English schools, 
loved and admired by hosts of friends, recog- 
nized as a poet of great promise, he offered 
himself at the outbreak of the war for the 
defence of the land to which he owed the 
gifts that made life dear to him. He saw 
active service in the trenches during the futile 
Antwerp expedition, and sailed in February

of this year on the still more futile expedition 
to the Dardanelles. There is a certain pain- 
ful appropriateness in the fact that one who 
perceived so plainly the irony of life, the 
eternal disproportion between effort and 
achievement, should be associated with two 
such tragic blunders. He died of blood- 
poisoning in the ^Egean on the twenty-third 
of April, at the age of twenty-seven, and was 
buried in the island of Scyros. One may 
apply to him Pater's exquisite words concern- 
ing Shakespeare's Claudio : " Called upon 
suddenly to encounter his fate, looking with 
keen and resolute profile straight before him, 
he gives utterance to some of the central 
truths of human feeling," though in Brooke 
that utterance is far from being " the sincere, 
concentrated expression of the recoiling flesh." 
For it is perfectly evident from his verse that 
he felt, without shrinking, the shadow of ap- 
proaching death. The group of sonnets pub- 
lished in 1914 after the outbreak of the war 
deals almost exclusively with this theme. 
Among them are the lines, now famous : 

" If I should die, think only this of me : 

That there's some corner of a foreign field 
That is for ever England. There shall be 

In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; 
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, 
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to 

roam, 

A body of England's, breathing English air, 
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. 

" And think, this heart, all evil shed away, 

A pulse in the eternal mind, no less 
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England 

given; 
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her 

day; 

And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, 
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven." 

It is natural to allow our judgment of 
Brooke's poetry to be swayed by the romance 
of his fate; natural, too, to estimate all his 
work in the light of a single triumphant 
utterance like this sonnet. One approaches 
his collected poems, therefore, with a certain 
misgiving. Can one retain one's critical judg- 
ment in the face of so strong a temptation to 
surrender it? But repeated readings of the 
volume only confirm one's first impression. 
Here is verse of great distinction, modern in 
method and feeling, but almost wholly free 
from the excess which blights the newer 
schools of poetry; verse that is in no sense 
academic, and that yet belongs, on the whole, 
to the ancient, sound English tradition. 
There is, no doubt, an occasional grossness of 
image, an undue emphasis upon unpleasant 
odors and upon certain ugly facts of the body,

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 23 



but this is the only evidence that the evil 
communications of our day have in any wise 
corrupted his excellent poetic manners. There 
are few metrical experiments, and those most 
successful. This poet has no need of license ; 
he has fulfilled the first duty of the artist, 
to confess the limitations of the medium in 
which he works. And in that medium he has 
achieved effects of extreme beauty : a delicate 
and varied music, an exquisite management 
of pause and quantity, an unobtrusive inven- 
tiveness of rhyme, happy verbal "finds" or 
revivals yet without a touch of pedantry, 
rich and vivid imagery. It is not, on the 
whole, simple poetry, though simplicity, too, 
was within the range of the poet's gift; but 
certainly the comparison with Donne that has 
been suggested is quite unwarranted. There 
is nothing in him of the tortuosity of the 
metaphysical school and its modern imitators. 
There is, indeed, no point in trying to place 
the poet, to evaluate him by comparison with 
others. It is enough to determine whether his 
voice, now silent, was indeed an authentic 
voice of poetry. Yet I cannot forbear to re- 
mark that in his best and most serious verse 
there is a grave stateliness that is all but 
Shakespearean. Such a sonnet as " The Busy 
Heart" would not be wholly out of place in 
the immortal series that deals with the golden 
youth and the Dark Lady. Nor am I afraid 
to say that it is a better sonnet, because a 
nobler and profounder, than the famous 
" Since there's no help, come let us kiss and 
part " of Drayton. 
" Now that we've done our best and worst, and 

parted, 
I would fill my mind with thoughts that will 

not rend. 
(0 heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted) 

I'll think of Love in books, Love without end; 
Women with child, content; and old men 

sleeping ; 
And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain 

grain; 
And babes that weep, and so forget their 

weeping ; 

And the young heavens, forgetful after rain; 
And evening hush, broken by homing wings; 

And Song's nobility, and Wisdom holy, 
That live, we dead. I would think of a thousand 

things, 

Lovely and durable, and taste them slowly, 
One after one, like tasting a sweet food. 

I have need to busy my heart with quietude." 

There are, indeed, several of the sonnets 
that seem to echo the rich Elizabethan music. 
They have often the same motif,- the illusion 
and the futility of passion. But they are not 
echoes, they are voices, gravely uttering the 
poet's own experience of life, his sorrows, his 



consolations, his shadowy but quenchless hope, 
his ecstasies flawed with the sense of their own 
impermanence. They have always a charac- 
teristic touch, a delightful difference, that 
marks them as the poet's own, and they are 
always ended with a felicity that not even the 
greatest Elizabethans invariably achieve. 
Take, for instance, Campion's stanzas begin- 
ning, "When thou must home to shades of 
underground," with its half-dozen lines of 
pure and faultless loveliness, and its impo- 
tent conclusion, and compare it with Brooke's 
sonnet, " Oh ! Death will find me, long before 
I tire." The younger poet is here handling a 
theme on which it is difficult not to be remi- 
niscent of the elder, but the individuality of 
the treatment, the lightness of touch, the 
breadth and suavity, above all, the inimitable 
grace of the closing couplet make the sonnet 
issue triumphantly even from so perilous a 
testing. 

" Oh ! Death will find me, long before I tire 

Of watching you; and swing me suddenly 
Into the shade and loneliness and mire 

Of the last land ! There, waiting patiently, 

" One day, I think, I'll feel a cool wind blowing, 

See a slow light across the Stygian tide, 
And hear the Dead about me stir, unknowing, 
And tremble. And I shall know that you have 
died, 

" And watch you, a broad-browed and smiling 

dream, 

Pass, light as ever, through the lightless host, 
Quietly ponder, start, and sway, and gleam 
Most individual and bewildering ghost ! 

" And turn, and toss your brown delightful head 
Amusedly, among the ancient Dead." 

So much, though a good deal more might be 
said, for the poet's manner. But what is after 
all the most vital aspect of the work of any 
poet who is worthy of the name is the ideas 
and emotions that it expresses, the revelation 
that it gives us of the man behind it. In the 
case of a young poet, nothing is so character- 
istic and revealing as his treatment of the 
passion of love, and here our poet is at his 
best. There is in much of his love-poetry a 
refreshing and unexpected note, a recognition 
of the truth that love and life are not quite 
identical, that those other minor "loves" upon 
which he dilates, the humble and fleeting joys 
of earth, may "impart a gusto" even to the 
grand passion, and that they may almost 
console for the lack or the loss of it. This is 
clearly not due to any want of virility or

that would " create a soul under the ribs of 
death." It is due rather to two qualities that 
are sufficiently rare in men of so ardent a 
temperament as his, a certain clear-eyed 
sense of the limitations of the great passion, 
and a kind of mystical reticence or remote- 
ness, a withholding of himself, a recognition 
of the finiteness of man's heart; and these 
two qualities save him from being a mere 
harp for the winds of passion to work their 
lawless will upon, and make him the master 
of his music. He knows that, Shakespeare 
notwithstanding, love is Time's fool, that 
with the fading of beauty, fades also the pas- 
sion that it inspired and that idealized it. 
" Oh, I'll remember ! but . . . each crawling day 

Will pale a little your scarlet lips, each mile 
Dull the dear pain of your remembered face." 

In the height of his ardors, he can still antici- 
pate the coming of the inevitable day when 
kindliness shall take the place of love, when 

" . . the best that cither's known 
Will change and wither and be less, 
At last, than comfort, or its own 
Remembrance." 

He recognizes also within himself and regis- 
ters a certain incapacity to rise to the highest 
levels of passion, the sudden chilling impo- 
tence that falls upon a temperament too 
reflective to yield itself to the enthralling 
moment. 

" There are wanderers in the middle mist, 
Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell 
Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom. 
... Of these am I." 

It will not do, of course, to interpret such 
admissions too literally. They may be partly 
dramatic, or the effect of a fleeting mood of 
self-reproach. Yet they recur too often to be 
ignored, and they are moreover quite in char- 
acter. But if any reader is inclined, because 
of these Hamlet-like misgivings, to think of 
the poet as a lover without ardor, he has only 
to turn to such a poem as "Mummia" in order 
to be persuaded that the lady to whom these 
verses were addressed would be exacting in- 
deed if she were not content with such a poet- 
lover. "Love's for completeness," he insists, 
and since completeness is unattainable in this 
fragmentary and distracting world, it is 
necessary to postpone the highest raptures 
and rewards of love to another life, where love 
is bodiless. Like the romantic poets of every 
age, he recognizes the human limitation ; but 
unlike the less wise of them, he acquiesces in 
it, and this acquiescence gives to his work, 
despite its intense modernity, a touch of the 
antique repose, the Platonic mysticism. The 
sonnet that begins " Not with vain tears, when 



we're beyond the sun " is an admirable exam- 
ple of that blending of poetic graces and 
felicities, half humorous, half sober, with a 
wholly profound and sincere idea, which gives 
his verse its rare distinction. And in this 
case, the underlying idea is unmistakably 
Platonic. 
" Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun. 

We'll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread 
Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead 

Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run 
Down some close-covered by-way of the air, 
Some low sweet alley between wind and wind, 
Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, 

find 
Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there 

" Spend in pure converse our eternal day ; 

Think each in each, immediately wise; 
Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say 

What this tumultuous body now denies; 
And feel, who have laid our groping hands away ; 

And see, no longer blinded by our eyes." 

Touches of Platonism, indeed, are frequent. 
The delightful lyric, " Tiare Tahiti," devoted 
to one of his wandering loves, embodies a 
charming and whimsical application of the 
doctrine of the Symposium. Life is soon 
over, love is fleeting, all fair and earthly 
things end, not in the grave that were too 
commonplace a conclusion but in the world 
of Types of which the poet-philosopher tells 
us, the world of " the divine beauty, pure and 
clear and unalloyed, not clogged with the pol- 
lutions of mortality and all the colours and 
vanities of human life." 

" And my laughter, and my pain, 

Shall home to the Eternal Brain. 

And all lovely things, they say, 

Meet in Loveliness again. 

And there'll no more be one who dreams 
Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff, 
Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems, 
All time-entangled human love." 

But alas, it is precisely "the colours and 
vanities" that are dear to us and make our 
fleeting life so dear. The world of Types is 
something chilly and remote to warm-blooded 
earth-dwellers, and hence the poet draws the 
practical and inevitable conclusion: 
" Hasten, hand in human hand, 
Down the dark, the flowered way." 

It is the old cry of the poets, but touched in 
these verses with a mysticism , that half re- 
deems it from the charge of mere earthliness. 
"Heaven's Heaven," the poet knows, though 

" we'll be missing 
The palms, the sunlight, and the south." 

It is this oscillation between the keenest, 
most poignant enjoyment of the things of 



608

sense and a realization of their transiency in 
relation to a world where they are transmuted 
into ideas that gives the poet's verse its char- 
acteristic note, a note that is neither sensuous 
nor reflective, but a subtle blending of both. 
"I have been so great a lover," he cries, so 
great a lover that his love embraces well-nigh 
all the things of earth. In the poem from 
which this phrase is taken, he enumerates the 
objects of his love, and a motley assemblage 
they are : " wet roofs beneath the lamplight," 
"the strong crust of friendly bread," "the 
cool kindliness of sheets that soon smooth 
away trouble," "Sleep; and high places; 
footprints in the dew." These things, too, 
must pass, like greater things; but before 
they end, he desires to record his love of 
them. He loves them simply, humanly, with- 
out reference to their poetic value. He is 
capable of homely as well as of extraordinary 
joys. Not being a product of over-sophistica- 
tion, he has no inclination to treat " the mere 
drift or debris of our days " as if it were not. 
And yet there is often a lurking symbolism in 
his treatment of the most commonplace and 
objective themes, which is all the more effec- 
tive for being implicit. The dining-room at 
tea-time and the examination-room are filled 
for an instant with august presences, "im- 
mote, immortal," beside the everyday or the 
grotesque beings who are visible and audible 
there. A night-journey by train is an image 
of that other mysterious journey of which the 
end is appointed, in which, 

" Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly." 
The fish in his cool, crystalline world feels 
dimly "the intricate impulse" that disturbs 
man, in his no less limited being, with long- 
ings from beyond the element that engulfs 
him. Thus the poet's homely loves verge upon, 
tend to unite with, his more exalted ones, as 
both are absorbed in the Idea. 

But it must not be inferred that all this 
high thinking and poetic feeling are un- 
touched by gaiety. Everywhere, even in the 
most incongruous situations, though with no 
effect of incongruity, the poet's humor plays 
over the high themes with which he deals, 
and thus redeems them from the portentous 
seriousness which is the bane of the young 
artist. His most eloquent verse is sane and 
cool, never over-fervid or grandiloquent, and 
his lighter verse is altogether charming. It is 
difficult to imagine a more successful thing of 
its kind than "The Old Vicarage, Grant- 
chester," with its blending of gaiety and 
gravity, beauty and burlesque ; and the poem 
called " Heaven " is a little triumph of satiri- 
cal felicity. " Caliban upon Setebos " is a 



profounder satire upon the incorrigible ma- 
terialism of man, but it is not more essentially 
humorous than our poet's conception of meta- 
physics as imaged in the fishy mind. 

" One may not doubt that, somehow, Good 
Shall come of Water and of Mud; 
And, sure, the reverent eye must see 
A purpose in Liquidity. 
We darkly know, by Faith we cry, 
The future is not Wholly Dry." 

Yet the poet, despite his youthful gaiety 
and his rapturous delight in life, is profoundly 
serious. The transiency of beauty and love, 
the eternal antimony of the relative and the 
absolute, these are his themes. And it is diffi- 
cult not to connect them with the thought 
of early death which runs like a subsidiary 
motif through all the intricate harmonies of 
his verse. It is not the mere morbidness of 
youth, the shadow cast by its brilliant sun- 
shine. It is a part of the great adventure of 
living. He looks forward with curiosity un- 
assuaged to the freedom, the wisdom, the 
unknown joys, the taintless love of that 
ampler, that diviner world. 

" There the sure suns of these pale shadows move ; 
There stand the immortal ensigns of our war; 
Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there, a star, 
And perishing hearts, imperishable Love." 

Nor does this obsession of the brevity of life 
for it is no less issue in lethargy or in 
quietism ; but rather in the felt need of " re- 
deeming the time," not because the days are 
evil, for they are a procession of beauty and 
opportunity, but because they are few. And 
so the poet, with the pathetic human craving 
for immortality, hastens to give what perma- 
nence he can to the crowding, evanescent 

loves, 

" the scented store 
Of song and flower and sky and face " 

which his spirit has acquired. There is no 
hoarding of joys, no "stern, spiritual frugal- 
ity" here. Nor, on the other hand, is there 
unbridled lavishness. All the manifold ele- 
ments of his vivid and eager life are in their 
place, and "compose" at last in an ordered 
picture. There is, moreover, little of the 
groping, tentative manner of young poets 
who have a lifetime in which to elaborate 
their image of the world. There is little of 
the youthful awkwardness that disfigures the 
early work even of a Keats. This is young 
poetry to be sure, with all the charm and 
vivacity of youth; but it is ripe poetry, too. 
The Fates that denied him length of days 
gave him in compensation an early and a rich 
maturity. One can hardly regret the work 
of which his death has deprived us, for what 
he has left us is so admirably complete. The

monument that he has built for himself has 
the finality, the freedom from effort, the 
serenity of an Attic grave-stone. One may 
even rejoice that such gifts as his are en- 
shrined henceforth beyond the reach of 
change. 

" We have found safety with all things undying, 
The winds and morning, tears of men and mirth, 
The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds 

flying, 
And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth." 

Like the actors in the carven pastoral of 
Keats's Ode, he remains immortally young, 
beautiful, heroic, flinging out his songs in the 
face of Death, never to be touched by the 
decay and squalor that overtake, too often, 
the loveliness of earth.

THE FEDERATION OF THE WORLD.* 

After the war, what next? Shall we settle 
down to get ready for other and more dread- 
ful wars, or will it be possible to develop an 
internationalism that will render all wars 
impossible? Mr. Hobson does not underesti- 
mate the magnitude of the step which he advo- 
cates in his book, " Towards International 
Government, " but he tries to show that it is 
the only practical alternative to a condition 
which he hopes and believes mankind will no 
longer tolerate. 

In the first place, it will by no means suffice 
to " crush German militarism," as the phrase 
goes, and then expect all to be well. As the 
author rightly insists, the thing to be crushed 
in Germany is not primarily an army and 
navy, but a state of mind, "a spirit of na- 
tional aggression, proud, brutal and unscru- 
pulous, the outcome of certain intellectual and 
moral tendencies." This condition of mind is 
not peculiar to Germany, but exists more or 
less in all countries, founded as it is on the 
baser instincts of mankind. Its manifesta- 
tions in private life are discouraged by every 
means possessed by society and the State, but 
in national affairs it is made respectable un- 
der the cloak of patriotism. It is a long step 
forward to do away with this colossal vice; 
but as Mr. Hobson remarks, we are not enter- 
ing upon any new policy, but only extending 
to larger affairs that which we have long 
relied upon in lesser. Within the memory of 
those living, many ancient idols of respecta- 
bility have been shattered, and many estab- 
lished customs called into question; many 
others are visibly doomed, and it needs only

the courage and determination which the pres- 
ent crisis should arouse, to attack the greatest 
of all evils. 

It is not supposed that the world will live 
in amity as the result of a general increase 
of personal righteousness. Something more 
than this, something dynamic, is required. 
The machinery must be created for the devel- 
opment of international activities. Already 
much machinery of this kind exists, for cer- 
tain limited purposes. Thus we have the 
International Postal Union, and numerous 
international societies of various kinds, some 
of which legislate for their members in regard 
to certain matters. Science is completely in- 
ternational. The fact is, that militaristic 
governments represent the survival of the 
ideals of a past age, and are out of joint with 
the progressive elements in modern civiliza- 
tion. 

The methods of diplomacy, no matter how 
able the diplomats, are doomed to failure. 
They are wholly undemocratic, and are left 
in the hands of men who belong to the ruling 
classes, "a caste strongly entrenched in eco- 
nomic and social privileges and with few 
opportunities for gaining knowledge of or 
sympathy with the life of the general body of 
the nation." Thus the fate of millions is 
decided as the outcome of a game, in which 
both sides are ignorant of the consequences of 
their actions, and indifferent to the broader 
considerations of justice and humanity. This 
may be true, in spite of the fact that the par- 
ticipants are highly trained, extremely able, 
and anxious to do their duty. It is especially 
important to appreciate this point, because an 
apparently formidable argument against in- 
ternationalism lies in the lamentable failure 
of negotiations between the picked men of 
Europe. Where these have failed, how shall 
others succeed? The answer is, that we need 
for this work a quite different type of mind ; 
we need men who will study the problems 
involved, weigh the consequences, and decide 
upon the merits of each case with due regard 
to all the peoples concerned. Such men exist 
in sufficient numbers to make a beginning; 
and when the Federation of the World is an 
established fact, men will be trained for this 
kind of service. It will no longer occur to 
anyone that he who strives for the welfare of 
humanity is in any degree injuring his own 
country. 

In all of this, there is no spirit of amor- 
phous " neutrality." Mr. Hobson's attitude is 
as far as possible from that of the academic 
jellyfish who believes that all opinions were 
born free and equal, and are equally entitled 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-

ness. The reviewer will suggest the phrase 
" Dynamic Neutrality " to express the status 
of those who are neutral in the sense of keenly 
desiring the welfare of the peoples of all 
warring nations, but who also desire to do 
everything in their power to bring about a 
just solution of the matters in dispute. This 
is the neutrality of a good police officer, who 
uses force only when other means fail. It 
seems to Mr. Hobson that it will be necessary 
for the united nations to at least be in a posi- 
tion to use force against any group which 
refuses to accept the established sanctions, but 
in the course of time this type of settlement 
will be less important. " Social, moral and 
economic pressure," as recommended by the 
International Congress of Women at the 
Hague, would ultimately bring any civilized 
country to terms. To the military minded, 
this sounds like a weak remedy ; but imagine 
the consequences to a nation "if all diplo- 
matic intercourse were withdrawn,; if the in- 
ternational postal and telegraphic systems 
were closed to a public law-breaker; if all 
inter-State railway trains stopped at his fron- 
tiers; if no foreign ships entered his ports, 
and ships carrying his flag were excluded 
from every foreign port; if all coaling sta- 
tions were closed to him; if no acts of sale 
or purchase were permitted to him in the 
outside world." This implies a unanimity of 
world-opinion which has never yet been ap- 
proached, but it would come perhaps as the 
result of full and accurate information, gath- 
ered and circulated by an international body 
commanding general respect. Long before 
any such extreme measures were adopted, the 
questions involved would have been discussed 
from every angle, and their bearing accu- 
rately estimated. Knowledge and responsi- 
bility may be expected to bring clarity of 
vision : " the agitator and the yellow journal- 
ist who work by spreading fears, suspicions 
and jealousies, and by imputing false motives 
to foreigners, owe all their power to the atmos- 
phere of ignorance in which they work." 

It appears to the reviewer that it is high 
time to organize a council or unofficial parlia- 
ment for the consideration of international 
questions in this country. Such a group 
might do much to clarify public opinion, by 
ascertaining and making known the facts re- 
lating to public affairs, and exposing the out- 
rageous misrepresentations with which the 
press is filled. It might also serve as a mouth- 
piece for the latent international good will 
which is at present almost inarticulate. Pro- 
posals for an international council of this 
type, to sit in Europe, are now before the 
public, and certainly deserve support; but it 



is desirable, indeed it is perhaps necessary, to 
organize the forces of internationalism sepa- 
rately in each country, to furnish as it were 
roots for the tree which we hope will eventu- 
ally bear the fruits of peace.

MAGIC CHARMS AND JEWELS. * 



Since Spencer and Gillen made their ex- 
haustive study of the manners and customs 
of the aboriginal Australians, and Dr. James 
G. Frazer showed in his invaluable work on 
Totemism the relations between the ideas of 
this most primitive of peoples and those of 
later phases of barbarism, one instinctively 
expects to find the origin of most supersti- 
tions in the customs of the Australian Bush- 
men. In whatever direction this dusky origi- 
nator of ideas may be found lacking, it is 
certainly not in that of a universal belief in 
sympathetic magic, with its accompanying 
developments in the working of charms by 
the wise men of the tribe, and through talis- 
manic objects. 

Dr. George Frederick Kunz, in his new 
book, " The Magic of Jewels and Charms," 
has collected an immense amount of valuable 
material, which some future anthropologist 
with a connected theory on the subject of the 
relationship of magic to the development of 
human thought will be able to use illustra- 
tively to great advantage. This material is 
made doubly valuable by an indication at the 
foot of each page of the sources whence the 
data are derived. One looks in vain, how- 
ever, for any constructive plan in the work. 
The author has strung his facts together in 
an almost totally unrelated fashion, like a 
colossal necklace of every variety of stone, 
precious and otherwise, held together by a 
thread of narrative so weak that it breaks at 
times. A person of encyclopaedic memory 
may enjoy packing facts, so presented, away 
in the pigeonholes of his brain ; but a thinker 
demands an arrangement of data into some 
harmonious whole, which will stimulate his 
powers of thought. It is true that Dr. Kunz 
often offers interesting observations, but 
these are sandwiched in like another sort of 
bead on the string, and are so frequently pre- 
fixed by a "perhaps" or a "probably" that 
their authoritativeness is greatly diminished. 

Although the author has not brought for- 
ward any new theory in regard to the develop- 
ment and degeneration of thought in relation 

* THE MAGIC or JEWELS AND CHARMS. By George Frederick 
Kunz. Illustrated. Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott Co.

to magic charms and stones, an absorbing ave- 
nue of study is opened up by his labors. Some 
day, no doubt, not only the material here 
brought together but the researches of others 
will be drawn upon for a scientific synthesis as 
complete as Dr. Joseph E. Pogue has furnished 
for a single stone in his elaborate study of the 
"History, Mineralogy, Geology, Ethnology, 
Archaeology, Mythology, Folklore, and Tech- 
nology of the Turquoise." In the meantime, 
anyone familiar with the work of such men 
as Tylor and Frazer will find many an inter- 
esting comparison suggested to him as he 
browses in this rich field of facts. 

When we read in Dr. Kunz's book that St. 
Apollonia of Alexandria is said to cure tooth- 
ache and all diseases of the teeth, the reason 
for this being that at her martyrdom all her 
beautiful teeth were pulled out, we are re- 
minded that the primitive Australian was in 
the habit of knocking out a tooth or two upon 
the ceremonies at the initiation into man- 
hood, and that this queer practice was by no 
means a meaningless ritual, but was founded 
upon the belief that a part of the soul was in 
this way preserved for re-incarnation in the 
future. At least, so many similar customs 
and their evident relationship with totems 
and totemism seem to indicate. In this way 
human teeth, and also the teeth of totem ani- 
mals, became magical objects. Another link 
in the chain is supplied by Dr. Kunz when he 
relates that in southern Russia a favorite 
amulet, especially valued for the protection 
of children and the cure of their diseases, is 
a wolf's tooth, or an imitation of a wolf's 
tooth made of bone and set in a ring. An- 
other phase of the mythology of teeth is shown 
in the custom of the Indians of Equador, 
Mexico, and Central America of decorating 
the teeth with precious stones, burial remains 
having been discovered with the teeth so 
decorated. "Among the Mayans here jadeite 
seems to have been the stone principally 
favored for this purpose; while in Mexico 
hematite has been met with in Oaxaca, tur- 
quoise in Vera Cruz, and at other places in 
the land rock-crystal and obsidian." Thus 
from a point of view where the teeth were 
considered so valuable as the magic reposi- 
tory of the soul that they were knocked out 
for safe keeping, we come to the stage where 
their value must be preserved by magic talis- 
mans; with intermediary phases, where an 
animal's tooth or an imitation of it takes the 
place of human teeth, or where a saint whose 
teeth had been sacrificed was especially gifted 
in curing the toothache. 

These are only a few facts, yet how much 
they reveal of the processes by which a primi- 



tive superstition becomes modified as time 
goes on, until its original significance is alto- 
gether forgotten, and the attributing of magic 
properties to an infinite variety of objects 
seems merely an arbitrary fancy! This mul- 
tiplication of magic objects began in the most 
primitive times. Every animal, every tree, 
every stone, might be a totem. Sometimes 
the totem was itself the ancestor of the tribe, 
sometimes it was a personal guardian spirit, 
and then again it was merely the repository 
of such ancestral or guardian spirits. 

Another primitive idea, that of producing 
desired effects by sympathetic magic, i. e., by 
some action which was thought to be imitative 
of the desired result, is, in the end, combined 
with the use of magic stones. Rain-making 
stones are among the most interesting of this 
sort, several examples of which are given by 
Dr. Kunz. The Dieri tribes of Central Africa 
believe that rain can only be produced by 
magic ceremonies through the intercession of 
ancestral spirits. In one of these ceremonies 
two large stones are used. 

" After a ceremonial in the course of which the 
blood drawn from the two chief sorcerers is 
smeared over the bodies of the others, the stones 
are borne away by these two sorcerers for a dis- 
tance of about twenty miles, and there put up 
upon the highest tree that can be found, the object 
evidently being to bring them as near to the clouds 
as possible." 

In another ceremony, rock-crystal as a rain 
compeller finds honor. To bring down rain 
from the sky, the wizards of the Ta-ta-thi 
tribe in New South Wales 

"break off a fragment of a crystal and cast it 
heavenward, enwrapping the rest of the crystal in 
feathers. After immersing these with their enclo- 
sure in water and leaving them to soak for a while, 
the whole is removed and buried in the earth, or 
hidden away in some safe place. The widely 
spread fancy that rock-crystal is simply congealed 
water may have something to do with the choosing 
of this stone as a rain maker." 
Another ceremony shows the primitive rain 
stone as influenced by Christian dogma. 

" Stone crosses have sometimes been used as 
rain-bringers, as in the case of one belonging to 
St. Mary's Church in the Island of Uist, one of 
the Outer Hebrides off the Scottish Coast. When 
drought prevailed here, the peasants would set up 
this cross, which usually lay flat on the ground, in 
the confident belief that rain would ensue. Of 
course, sooner or later, it was sure to come, and 
then the cross, having done its duty, was quietly 
placed in its former horizontal position." 

While the mysteries connected with such 
magic charms as teeth, ordinary stones, and 
many other quite unromantic objects, cannot 
be explained without delving into primitive 



-612

[Dec. 23 



origins, it is quite comprehensible that an 
electric gem such as the tourmaline for exam- 
ple should impress a primitive mind, as it does 
our own, with the strangeness of its proper- 
ties. Here is an inorganic body in which the 
spirit can actually be awakened and made to 
do things before our very eyes. What Dr. 
Kunz has to say of the tourmaline comes 
under the head of fact rather than of magic. 
He tells us that the electrical quality of this 
stone was first noticed by some Dutch chil- 
dren, who were puzzled to see bits of straw 
and ash attracted by some crystals of tourma- 
line that had been brought from the Orient. 

A belief in the magic properties of amber, 
not only as a curative agent, but as a gener- 
ally helpful sort of object to have around, 
especially in the form of a necklace, goes 
back at least to the days of Thales. Much 
interesting lore in regard to this stone, as 
well as to another magnetic stone, the load- 
stone, has been collected by Dr. Kunz. 

The part played by precious stones in 
magic lore is an infinitely varied one. Here, 
beauty furnishes the mystery, a beauty 
which "flashes its laugh at Time." A spirit 
locked up in a diamond might be expected 
never to escape. Volmar, in his " Steinbuch," 
ufter enumerating all the well known pre- 
cious stones, proceeds to relate that 
" There is one which produces blindness, another 
that enables the wearer to understand the lan- 
guage of birds, still another that saves people 
from drowning, and, finally, one of such sovereign 
power that it brings back the dead to life. How- 
ever, we are told that because of the miraculous 
virtues of these stones God hides them so well that 
no man can obtain them." 

To this may be added the witness of Saint 
Hildegard of Bingen, who wrote that "just 
as a poisonous herb placed on a man's skin 
will produce ulceration," by an analogous 
though contrary effect, "certain precious 
stones, if placed on the skin, confer health 
and sanity by their virtue." As Dr. Kunz 
observes, since the discovery of radium and 
its effect upon disease, it is quite believable 
that the numberless stories about the cura- 
tive properties of stones, especially magnetic 
stones, are based upon scientific fact. 

The chapter about meteorites contains a 
melange of science and myth, not in the least 
welded together, but nevertheless full of in- 
teresting information. Other chapters deal 
with "Fabulous Stones," "Snake Stones and 
Bezoars," and " The Religious Use of Stones." 
In these chapters we may wander through a 
labyrinthine museum of stones and gems, 
among -which we shall find stones that are 
purely figments of the imagination; stones 



which sometimes were, sometimes were imag- 
ined to have been, formed inside of human 
beings or animals, and all having magic sig- 
nificance; stones which were sacred to the 
gods of various peoples, gems upon which 
angel figures are engraved, until the reader 
feels as if wandering in some magnificent 
treasure vault of ancient story, with freedom 
to take all he can carry away with him. 

Only a tiny handful has been carried away 
and brought to notice by the present reviewer. 
Every reader is therefore advised to go and 
gather for himself in this treasure house of a 
virtuoso who, though he has not furnished a 
clue to the labyrinth, has surrounded every 
one of his gems with a halo of scientific and 
imaginative interest. 

The book is a large-sized quarto, beautifully 
printed on heavy paper, and is enriched with 
a generous supply of unusually satisfying 
illustrations, some of them in color.

HISTORY AS IT Is POPULARIZED.* 



Between the professional historian and the 
irresponsible hack writer a great gulf is 
fixed, and rightly so. But occasionally from 
opposite sides of the chasm each attempts to 
hurl a missile at his supposititious rival, as 
does the author of " The Road to Glory." The 
effort seems to call for a rejoinder ; although, 
in the interchange, the provocative champion 
is likely to go unscathed. Let us hope that 
the innocent bystander, totally unconscious or 
mildly curious, may be equally fortunate. 

Mr. Powell complains that the highway of 
history is altogether too dusty. Consequently 
his "road" must be liberally sprinkled with 
blood. This remark is prompted by one of 
his recent letters from the war front. Evi- 
dently he dotes on gory scenes, but his reader 
is likely to become wearied with the excessive 
carnage through which he is forced to wade. 
The stone wall with its firing squad; the 
deadly "storm of lead," spitting forth pro- 
miscuously on the parched plains of the 
Southwest (possibly in default of more wel- 
come showers, but varied occasionally by a 
rain of arrows, javelins, and less familiar 
weapons) ; the miasmatic swamp, tropical 
jungle, savage-infested forest, and snow-clad 
mountains, all of these afford an interest- 
ing setting for Mr. Powell's glorious roadway. 
But through frequent use in melodramatic 
offering, these properties have become taw-

dry, and afford but poor disguise to the 
author's sanguinary puppets. 

His chief characters are indeed but pup- 
pets, faintly suggesting the best creations of 
Kipling or Stevenson, but more familiar in 
the old time ten-cent " thriller." Witness his 
"two gun men," with bowie knives in their 
teeth, exhibiting the filibuster in proper 
aureole. But Mr. Powell would have us 
believe that such men won "three-fourths of 
the territory of the United States." They did 
win for themselves and their countrymen a 
hatred and fear, mingled with contempt, that 
the Latin- American does not yet wholly con- 
ceal in his intercourse with their more cul- 
tured successors. They paved the way for 
the later settlers of Texas much as the pesti- 
lence that preceded the coming of the Pil- 
grims providentially favored the planting of 
New England by ridding it of inharmonious 
natives. We do not deny that the era of the 
filibuster needs a more adequate treatment 
than any reputable historian has yet accorded 
it; but it also demands a more restrained 
judgment than the present work reveals. 

The same over-emphasis characterizes the 
whole volume, and mingled with it is a prac- 
tice even less praiseworthy. In the bath-tub 
interview between Napoleon and his brothers, 
Mr. Powell introduces Joseph's clenched fist, 
although Henry Adams (his unnamed author- 
ity) does not confirm this little by-play. Mr. 
Adams's pages, however, abundantly attest 
the " Roadster's " diligence as a copyist, espe- 
cially when describing the Indians of the 
Northwest. His propensity to exaggerate 
again appears in the assertion that Harrison's 
encounter with the Indians on the Tippe- 
canoe "started an avalanche which ended by 
crushing Napoleon." The avalanche, really a 
tidal wave, was already started ; but it would 
be difficult to prove that our entire second 
struggle with Great Britain greatly affected 
its course, not to mention this minor frontier 
skirmish. Again Jackson, almost unaided, 
achieves (in these pages) the "conquest" of 
the Floridas. We will not quarrel with Mr. 
Powell's use of the term to describe this 
acquisition, but a more judicious view of the 
events leading up to it would include Jeffer- 
son, Madison, Monroe, and, above all, John 
Quincy Adams. 

Our guide does not greatly fancy "suave 
frock-coated diplomats," and rightly assigns 
them the lesser part in winning our national 
domain; but he ignores these gentlemen in 
" high black stocks " altogether too much. On 
the other hand, he errs as grievously in bring- 
ing his frontiersman into the diplomatic cir- 
cle. Marcus Whitman, " in his worn and torn 



garments of fur and leather," coonskin cap 
and all, is an heroic figure; but he does not 
need a fanciful interview with President 
Tyler and Secretary Webster to establish this 
fact. Of course, such an interview affords a 
more dramatic climax to "the greatest ride" 
than a mere appearance before a missionary 
board. Accordingly our reporter, with a 
headline in mind, undeterred by an absolute 
lack of competent authorities, makes his story 
correspond with his wishes. How difficult to 
bury an historical legend, when it lies so con- 
veniently near the pseudo-militant highway! 

One hesitates to pursue "The Road to 
Glory" farther, although our guide promises 
strangely lurid stretches in Africa, Sumatra, 
and Japan. The failure to maintain a proper 
perspective nearer home casts doubt upon all 
his journeyings. With equal distrust we note 
that time and place mean little to him. Louisi- 
ana, the steamboat, and Texas are hopelessly 
confused in chronology, and so are Nolan, 
Hidalgo, and their contemporaries of the first 
chapter. The American people are noted for 
their rapid migrations, but two years is too 
short a time to introduce twenty thousand of 
them into Texas, even with the schooner on 
the Gulf assisting the "prairie schooner" in 
the process. Winter crops may concern the 
present residents of that commonwealth, but 
in 1835 they influenced the volunteers that 
captured Bexar less than the Mexican consti- 
tution of 1824. It was in behalf of that docu- 
ment, rather than for " the flag with a single 
star," that the defenders of the Alamo died. 

One can excuse Mr. Powell for not know- 
ing the Salcedoes apart; but he ought at 
least to master the career of the Kempers, 
and not put Calhoun, perforce, into Jackson's 
cabinet. Some years ago, indeed, a well 
known and fairly constant Democratic candi- 
date for the presidency urged the wisdom of 
inviting the vice-president to confer with 
the cabinet. But the American people did 
not then empower him to form one, and his 
stormy patron saint of the earlier day cer- 
tainly cherished no such intention to honor 
his running mate. Incidentally we might 
suggest to our chronicler that their estrange- 
ment affords a good story ; but in view of the 
present performance, we have no desire that 
he should undertake it. Avoiding diplomats 
on principle, we cannot expect him to be accu- 
rate in regard to our affairs with Spain ; but 
he should do better in respect to his filibuster- 
ing favorites. 

We can also, with reason, ask our con- 
ductor to pay more attention to his geogra- 
phy. He should not, even for a " joy ride," 
assemble "the Spanish Cortes in Mexico."

Nor should he confuse Natchitoches with 
Natchez, for they mark separate stages in 
the advance of our frontier. " Tallahassee " 
may be substituted for Pensacola, if necessary 
to change at least one word in a cribbed 
sentence; but it does not strengthen the 
context, largely derived, without any ac- 
knowledgment whatever, from Henry Adams. 
"Austin" alone is confusing apart from ^he 
" San Felipe " with which it was joined in 
early days; it does not designate the capital 
on the Colorado. "Tohopeka" and "Horse 
Shoe Bend " are joined on one page and sepa- 
rated on another, with some resulting confu- 
sion. A glance at the proper map would 
show " Palo Alto " and " Resaca de la Palma " 
on this side of the Rio Grande. Perhaps 
Doniphan's " Thousand " marched six thou- 
sand miles, but their annalist does not clearly 
show how he measures this extensive "Anaba- 
sis," nor does he substantiate his claim that it 
added a territory larger than the whole 
United States at that time. These few in- 
stances and they form only a small part of 
the errors, in place as well as in date will 
serve to show how little reliance is to be 
placed in the author's accuracy or honesty of 
purpose. 

But he has produced a readable book! 
" Solar plexus blows," " varsity foot ball 
team," "racing skull at Poughkeepsie," "accu- 
racy of Matthewson across the plate," these 
phrases are as familiar as they are likely to 
prove ephemeral. " Stealing candy from a 
child " will popularize almost any plagiarism. 
Perhaps the United States acquired Florida 
in the manner that suggests the "neatness 
and dispatch of a meat-cutting machine," but 
one tires of these everlasting carnal similes. 
They might be more bearable if one had confi- 
dence in their accuracy. But like the descrip- 
tions of the battlefields that line his bloody 
"Road," they are largely the product of a 
disordered imagination. 

In itself this inaccurate and thoroughly 
reprehensible book is unworthy the attention 
we have given it. But it represents a certain 
type of pseudo-historical writing that cannot 
be too strongly condemned. With all his 
shortcomings, the " dry-as-dust historian " has 
no such misdemeanor as this to answer for. 
Nor are the publishers wholly guiltless, for 
nearly every page exhibits manifest errors 
that cursory editorial supervision could easily 
check. Careless reviewing, of which the 
present writer has already noted some con- 
spicuous, if respectable, instances, may ob- 
tain for this book wider reading than it 
merits; but for the sake of Mr. Powell's 
reputation as a war correspondent, let us 



hope not. Had he called his volume "The 
Paths of Glory" we might, for the nonce, 
quote Gray's famous line with more assur- 
ance that another useless but harmful book 
will speedily rest in the grave it deserves.

THE STORIED BUILDINGS OF VIRGINIA.* 

The colonial mansions of Virginia- have fig- 
ured in many books and have been the object 
of more than one special treatment, that of 
Mrs. Sale being hitherto the most complete. 
All of these yield in elaborateness and inter- 
est to Mr. Robert A. Lancaster's "Historic 
Virginia Homes and Churches," now pub- 
lished in a limited edition. The author's 
statement that his book includes " practically 
all the principal Colonial homes of historic 
interest" is scarcely an exaggeration, and 
there are even many relatively obscure 
houses from times considerably later than the 
colonial period. With its three hundred fine 
illustrations from photographs, many of them 
showing buildings now destroyed or altered, it 
forms a veritable corpus of Virginian archi- 
tecture. 

Among the many buildings here illustrated 
practically for the first time, one may note 
especially Long Branch, Dover, and, above 
all, Bremo, as superb examples of the Vir- 
ginia mansion. The last especially, a joint 
product of the architectural genius of Jeffer- 
son and the solicitude of its owner, General 
Cocke, deserves to be ranked with Westover, 
Mount Airy, Mount Vernon, and Monticello 
in skilful composition and beauty of aspect. 
A single very desirable addition to the list 
occurs to the reviewer, Jefferson's own sec- 
ond house at Poplar Forest, still standing, 
unique in its octagonal form. 

Since Mr. Lancaster is an officer of the 
Virginia Historical Society, and has had the 
assistance of many of the foremost historical 
workers in the state, his text might well be 
expected to clear up many of the doubtful 
questions regarding the times when the houses 
were built. There is in his pages, to be sure, 
a wealth of family history, the descent of 
the estates is accurately traced, the names of 
the builders are given, and there is much 
new material regarding the younger and 
smaller places. Of thorough-going research 
into the origins of the older and greater 
places, however, there is little. The often 
repeated views and dates recur, in passages 
which the specialist readily recognizes as bor-

rowed word for word from earlier local works, 
even though the author has often neglected 
quotation marks and references. Mr. Lancas- 
ter makes no attempt to give any sketch of 
the general development of Virginian archi- 
tecture, for which he has furnished such rich 
material. Indeed, throughout the text, he is 
less concerned with the buildings themselves 
than with their occupants and associations. 

It would have been interesting to trace the 
gradual transformation of Virginia houses and 
churches from the half -mediaeval character of 
the earliest examples to the neo-classic splen- 
dors of Berry Hill and the Monumental 
Church at Richmond. English styles had here 
their reflections, clearly, as in the florid 
Georgian of Westover, the strictly Palladian 
of Mount Airy; more dimly in the delicate 
vernacular of Mount Vernon. With the inter- 
vention of Jefferson, above all in the design of 
the Capitol in Richmond, however, began a 
striving for something more universal, based 
directly on the scheme of the classic temple. 
In its literalness, as well as in its relation to 
the Roman cast of our early republicanism, 
this movement had aspects specifically Amer- 
ican, and gave us, for more than a generation, 
a distinctively national architecture. 

The amateur and traveller, however, will 
perhaps think that its very lacks are recom- 
mendations of the book, and will prefer it for 
its bountiful garner of myths and anecdotes 
and its ante bellum flavor. The beauties, the 
cavaliers, the ghosts of the old mansions are 
duly chronicled, and the reader is left to 
believe that Jefferson wrote the Declaration 
at Rosewell or at Gunston Hall according to 
which he is visiting. Text and pictures alike 
are pleasant to look over, and luxurious make- 
up renders the volume an ideal possession 
for any lover of colonial days in the Old

RECENT FICTION.* 



There must be some great attraction in 
writing an imaginative biography. Mr. Ben- 
nett and Mr. Wells revived an interest in it 
not long ago, and for the last few years they 
have had many followers. Of course the idea 
is not new; "Robinson Crusoe," though we 
often do not remember it, begins at birth and 
only ends when Crusoe had got beyond the 
probability of adventure. " Tom Jones " was

but the first masterpiece of a long succession 
of books which began with the birth of some- 
body and ended at one place or another, 
usually marriage. Among them have been 
some of the best English novels, "David 
Copperfield," " Pendennis," " The Mill on the 
Floss"; and there are plenty more in other 
literatures as well as English. But until 
lately it has hardly been a favorite form with 
us. It certainly has some disadvantages for 
the reader, in spite of what must be advan- 
tage to the writer. It lacks the definite 
impression that may be made by an abler han- 
dling of plot, although it does give one a wide 
range of opportunity and call for correspond- 
ing abilities. 

Mrs. Norris's "The Story of Julia Page" 
begins with Julia's very early days, indeed 
it begins with her mother before there was 
any Julia. It goes on, not until Julia had 
become as old as Robinson Crusoe, but to the 
point where she seemed to have got over the 
main struggles of existence. For all this, there 
may be very good reasons. Mrs. Norris may 
have wished to show how a girl of poor begin- 
nings, who wanted to conquer, could conquer, 
and that in a fine way, a fine place in Amer- 
ican life. Or she may have wished to deal 
with one of the curious phases of married 
life, the effects of things done before mar- 
riage. Or she may have thought it interest- 
ing to present an example of the different 
standards by which people are likely to esti- 
mate certain of the shortcomings of men and 
women. All these things she does, and to do 
them she needed no narrower field than she 
has taken. 

It may be thought that she would have not 
only hit the nail on the head but would have 
driven it home more effectively had she con- 
fined her attention (and ours) to one matter, 
and not have diffused both over so broad a 
field. But it is likely to be the way of the 
artist to get more interested in people than in 
problems, and it is likely enough to have been 
so with Mrs. Norris. At any rate, she has 
written an excellent book, full of very natural 
people of all sorts and also one rather un- 
natural one who by his eccentricity supplies 
the possibility for what is presumably the 
main thing in the book. 

Julia's husband suddenly deserts her. We 
take the liberty to believe that his leaving his 
wife is as much a matter of convention as his 
coming back to her. But it takes all sorts of 
people to make up a world, and one need not 
deny the possibility of either. And if a young 
doctor was so emotional a person as to do the 
one thing, he would doubtless be quite emo-

tional enough to do the other. Only he prob- 
ably did more things of the same kind, so that 
the story of Julia Page was not really over 
when Mrs. Norris ceased to write. What we 
do have of it, however, is throughout good. 
There are plenty of phases of life in it, some 
crude or slovenly, some refined and easy, some 
a curious mixture, but all confidently and not 
too minutely descriptive, giving an excellent 
environment for many real people who do this 
and that, have their own pleasure and busi- 
ness, and now and then touch on what are 
called the deeper phases of life. 

Miss Canfield, in " The Bent Twig," has as 
broad a view, but is more original. Mrs. 
Norris deals with matters one has heard of 
before, rising in life, the double standard, 
life before marriage, and so on, and deals 
with them sincerely and truly. Miss Canfield 
presents new and unexpected ideas as she 
goes along, and as a rule something that she 
has got out of life for herself. It is perhaps 
rather conventional to pass from a State Uni- 
versity town in the middle west to country 
life in the "cultured" east, and it certainly 
was daring (even late Victorian) to go on 
to dear Paris. But even the most original 
themes come from the same old notes; and 
after all, people have to be somewhere. "We 
are sorry she could not have left out Botti- 
celli, but that's a detail. 

Miss Canfield has written a very fine book. 
At the beginning she appears particularly as 
a very clear observer, if sometimes a bit cold 
and even aloof and satirical. Her account of 
the democracy of the common schools would 
teach more concerning that interesting topic 
than many textbooks. Her explanation of 
why Sylvia was not elected to a fraternity is 
a more incisive arraignment of college life 
than one often hears in public. But these 
notes and much more in the earlier chapters 
are preliminary to the actual work of the 
novelist, the work of following people here 
and there in life and showing how it stirs 
them. 

The book is called "The Bent Twig" be- 
cause it tells how Sylvia's education was the 
result of her earlier life. She was born and 
brought up in what she subsequently called 
an unworldly home, adding mistakenly that it 
was artificial and a hothouse. Whatever it 
was, she would not allow herself to be hypno- 
tized into looking at things through their 
eyes ; so she had to get her own education in 
her own way, and she did. But she turned 
out much as her mother would have prophe- 
sied, had she been given to prophecy. 

In such a book one sees and feels the attrac- 
tion of the biography. It allows, it demands 



so much. Just as one of Smollett's heroes, 
Peregrine Pickle say, peregrinates through a 
thousand pickles, so Miss Canfield can convey 
Sylvia through a perfect Odyssey of possi- 
bilities, only whereas Smollett had merely 
to allow his imagination to play about the 
recollection of the violent practical jokes de- 
lightful to the eighteenth century, Miss Can- 
field has to conceive the possible blind alleys 
in an easy luxurious life of to-day. She does 
it, too; and if she does have a little of the 
aloofness just mentioned, it is not wonderful. 
There is something about " culture " in Amer- 
ica, whether real or imaginary, that makes 
it impossible for people to take it quite seri- 
ously ; it ought indeed to be worn lightly and 
humorously rather as a garment, with appre- 
ciation of its quality as a pose. Miss Canfield 
understands the whole thing; she is a little 
unpitying with the art she does not love, but 
allows herself to be indulgent toward the one 
she does. That gives variety and charm to 
what is otherwise immensely able and living. 
We will add no more encomiums, but they 
may readily be found in the advertisements, 
which (for this occasion only) are quite 
dependable. 

"Peter Paragon," by Mr. John Palmer, is 
not much like these two save in that it is the 
story of a life. It is lighter in touch, for one 
tiling. Mr. Palmer is content to sketch his 
background rather lightly, and gives no care- 
ful pictures of the different phases of life 
through which Peter makes his way, or rather, 
meanders about. He summarizes a good deal, 
and is content to tell on in a general way how 
things were without insisting on much detail. 
It is all done in a few touches, the family, the 
garden, school, Oxford, the farm, the country 
house, London life politics, theatre, and so 
on, but of course a fine sketch is something 
worth while. And after all, it is only the 
background that is sketched, doubtless of pur- 
pose. Peter is more substantial, and so is his 
mother. Nobody is very real, but they are 
real enough. 

Still, it is not a very adequate account of 
Peter's life. There must have been a great 
deal that went to the making of him that we 
know nothing about, and that Mr. Palmer 
does not care to tell us. He is intent on the 
man only in the way he felt about woman. 
Peter was curiously fortunate in this respect, 
after all, the thing is a love story, curiously 
conceived, with the two chief people seeing 
nothing of each other most of the time. Peter 
learned the theory of this very important, 
delightful, and mysterious side of life in a 
very happy way. "At an age when the secrets 
of life are the subject of uneasy curiosity at

best, and at worst of thoughtless defamation, 
Peter and Miranda talked of them as they 
talked of their bees." That seems nice, if 
somewhat unusual. The practical part came 
otherwise, Peter had to learn that by him- 
self, some of it at least, at Oxford, in the 
country, in London. Such learning might have 
been accomplished in various ways : Peter was 
again fortunate in having a very strong desire 
for nothing but the very best. He might have 
been satisfied with that enemy of the very 
best, the good, or what seemed so, or even 
with the bad. But he was not ; he would have 
only the very best. It is a bit of idealism, 
after all. Not that there are no such men. 
There are, and it is well to hear of one of 
them. Some people take the easier course, 
and tell of more ordinary men. Peter was an 
idealist ; he wanted to put his whole soul into 
his life, and that he couldn't do, until he 
could. To make that matter clear, Mr. Palmer 
gives up everything else; there is not more 
plot than background, and what there is 
the return of Miranda is about as natural 
and probable as the end of "The Vicar of 
Wakefield." 

Still, these matters (though proper to note) 
one can accept in such a book. For myself, 
I cannot but feel how much more powerful the 
book would be if we had the whole thing fully 
developed, as Mrs. Norris and Miss Canfield 
have developed their ideas, all the people 
and places, all the detail, or rather not all 
but more than we have, a fuller and richer 
picture. But that was not Mr. Palmer's way ; 
he is more delicate. 

What variety of phases and forms of human 
life and character such books give us ! There 
is no experience so strange and out of the way 
or so common and well-known as not to find a 
place somewhere. Our earlier novelists put 
into such books all kinds of things that would 
amuse, or charm, or please, or excite, or per- 
haps merely relieve the tedium of labor or 
existence. Our own writers use it also to 
enlarge the sympathy and knowledge, to 
arouse our thoughts in life, to suggest ways 
out of hard places, and for the hundred other 
things that have come into fiction as its field 
has grown. These books we have been speak- 
ing of are examples: they give not only the 
difficulties and adventures of manhood and 
womanhood, but the griefs and joys and diffi- 
culties of childhood and of youth; they give 
not only life in one place but in different 
places, not only in one social surrounding but 
in others, for few lives are so monotonous as 
to pass always in the same surroundings, so 
that the enlarging variety possible in other 
novels is necessary in this. Such novels give 



us the true form for this particular age of 
ours, certainly the great majority of the 
best novels of recent years come to mind as 
we think of the matter. Perhaps the form 
calls for the greatest skill ; certainly it gets it. 

Yet one must acknowledge, too, that there 
are dangers as well as opportunities. There 
is the temptation to lose all thought of what 
the academic mind calls a plot. "Real life 
has no beginning and no end," says Mr. 
Patrick MacGill, who cuts off " slices of life " 
(or something very like it; I quote from 
memory) and whether that be so or not, 
such books as these are often mere collections 
of human experience, moulded only in a very 
general way by any preconceived plan. The 
books we have been speaking of are undoubt- 
edly modelled with care ; Miss Canfield's espe- 
cially carries us on and on with a sense of 
necessity that tells finely. But a good many 
of the novels of this kind that come readily 
to mind are by no means so definite. Mr. 
Lawrence's "Sons and Lovers" is a book 
of real beauty, but I cannot easily see why it 
begins where it does or ends where it does, or 
why it has in it just what it has. Mr. Law- 
rence probably feels that it should have ex- 
actly what it has; but I (the average reader) 
do not. So with Mr. Coningsby Dawson's 
"Garden without "Walls," which also had 
much that was beautiful in it. Why did it 
have just what it had and nothing else? And 
the same thing may be asked of a hundred 
other books of later years. 

But such talk of plot or story may seem 
idle if the book be interesting. Mr. Wells 
says that "the assumption that the novel, 
like the story, aims at a single, concentrated 
impression" is a "fallacy." I think not. I 
think that a novel can make a great and last- 
ing impression, and sometimes does ; and that 
in making such an impression construction 
plays a great part. Hence we have from 
" Jane Eyre," for example, or " The House of 
Mirth," a certain intense experience of the 
emotions that has few equals in the life of art. 
But this is no place to discuss such matters ; 
even, lacking that fine impression, and the 
story of a life generally does lack it, there 
is certainly much else that many people like 
just as well. EDWARD E. HALE.

BIOGRAPHY AND REMINISCENCES. 

On the eighteenth of this month Dr. Lyman 
Abbott attained the age of eighty, and he looks 
back upon sixty years' activity as preacher, editor, 
author, and lecturer. That period, rich in expe- 
rience and teeming with associations of mary 
kinds, furnishes matter for a goodly volume of 
five hundred pages, with the little distinctive but 
always alluring title, "Reminiscences" (Hough- 
ton). The son of Jacob Abbott, familiar to our 
childhood by reason of his " Rollo Books " and his 
"Lucy Books," and the nephew of John S. C. 
Abbott, dear to our somewhat later years because 
of his entrancing " History of Napoleon Bona- 
parte," the author of these retrospections cannot 
fail to appeal to our interest, and his chapters are 
indeed of that anecdotal, genially personal, ripely 
reflective, and, not least of all, moralizing and ser- 
monizing quality which was looked for with confi- 
dent expectation. Men and events of importance 
are introduced in every chapter, and the whole is 
a thesaurus of variously interesting reading. Por- 
traits and other illustrations abound, and an un- 
usually full index closes the book. 

In a " foreword " to his " Memories of India " 
(David McKay), Sir Robert Baden-Powell, dis- 
tinguished military officer and head of the Boy 
Scout Movement, says : " Perhaps the only re- 
deeming point about these ' Memories ' is that they 
are largely extracted from diaries and letters which 
were not written with the idea of anyone ever see- 
ing them except my mother. To some extent they 
tell directly against me, since they show me to 
have been just the ordinary silly young ass who 
enjoyed senseless ragging, was fond of dogs and 
horses, and thought very little as he went through 
the ordinary every-day experience of a subaltern 
in India. There is nothing very romantic or very 
exciting about them, and there is much that is 
silly, but at the same time such things have, I 
think, seldom been set down in writing just as they 
occurred to one at the time." But one must not 
be led astray by this English air of ostentatious 
irresponsibility; for the young officer was evi- 
dently doing a lot of hard working and clear 
thinking all the time. The topics treated range 
from "The Afghan War" to "Lemon Pudding 
and Mustard," through every conceivable inter- 
mediary subject. The author has a vivacious pen, 
and the ubiquitous black-and-white illustrations 
bear witness to a ready and gifted pencil, as do 
the eighteen colored plates also. 

In her eighty-fifth year Mrs. Amelia E. Barr 
publishes the reflections and counsels and placid 
retrospections of her serene old age, under the 
title, "Three Score and Ten" (Appleton). Why 
she did not make it " Four Score and Five " she 
does not explain, but the book supplements her 
recent autobiography in a manner very acceptable 
to those interested in her spiritual experiences as 
distinguished from the more stirring outward 
events of her busy and fruitful life. That her 



faith in the things unseen shows itself here and 
there in her pages as something akin to spiritual- 
ism, need trouble only the carnally minded; it is 
all beautiful and significant as she puts it before 
us with a sort of noble unreserve. Should any 
harsh critic of her book as a whole object that she 
had given us her best wine first, in her autobiog- 
raphy, and that here we have little more than the 
rinsings of the bottle, her admirers might fitly 
retort, " Is not the gleaning of the grapes of 
Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? " 

The "Heroes of the Nations" series (Putnam), 
a venture which for some time has provided an 
ever-growing collection of scholarly and readable 
biographies of the more prominent characters of 
history, seems to have come to a close. Two recent 
biographical studies, "Alfred the Truthteller" by 
Miss Bertha Lees, and " Isabel of Castile " by 
Miss lerne Plunket, which seem to have been origi- 
nally planned for this series, have been published 
in a somewhat different form and without the 
serial title. The new volumes are larger and more 
attractive, and have no footnotes; otherwise the 
contents are of the same general type as in the 
earlier volumes. Miss Plunket's biography of 
Queen Isabel is in every way worthy of a place in 
any series that aims to record the achievements of 
great men and women. Isabel of Castile is a per- 
son of great importance not only for the history 
of Spain but of the modern world as well. Her 
marriage to Ferdinand of Aragon made possible 
the creation of the Spanish monarchy, which for a 
hundred years was the greatest power in the world. 
The subject of Isabella's career is one that readily 
lends itself to eulogistic treatment ; but the author 
cannot be charged with having given the strenuous 
queen greater praise than her deeds have earned 
for her. Forty-five excellent illustrations, chiefly 
portraits, and a map of the Spanish peninsula in 
the fifteenth century, add materially to the inter- 
est and value of the work. 

Good company and good anecdotes are to be 
found in plenty between the covers of Mr. Alfred 
Capper's reminiscent volume, "A Rambler's Recol- 
lections and Reflections" (Scribner). For thirty 
years and more Mr. Capper has been a public 
entertainer, and has appeared as such before most 
of the royalties of Europe, not to mention the 
nobility, gentry, and common people. He is a 
thought-reader, and though he confesses he does 
not know how he does them, he has the reputation 
of doing some very extraordinary things at his 
entertainments, about which and about the cele- 
brated men and women he has met in his profes- 
sional journeyings he writes in a manner that few 
will fail to find interesting. His reminiscences are 
of the sort that the late Marshall P. Wilder and 
Mr. Weedon Grossmith have so successfully 
offered to their willing readers. The author's por- 
trait and other illustrations are inserted. 

The reader of Mr. Poultney Bigelow's " Prussian 
Memories " (Putnam) might be tempted to accuse 
the author of discursiveness, were it not that the 
latter has disarmed such criticism by a frank 
avowal of his intention to be garrulous. His book

is disjointed, gossippy, at times irrelevant, but 
altogether delightful. Mr. Bigelow has that proper 
sense of humor which consists in seeing things 
(including one's self) in their true proportions. 
Though he is a cosmopolitan globe-trotter, who has 
lived long in Germany and loved it, he acknowl- 
edges that the English-speaking world is his home. 
Mr. Bigelow's acquaintance with Prussia began in 
1864, when at eight years of age he was put into 
a boarding-school at Bonn. His friendship with 
William II was formed a little later, when the 
boys became playmates at Potsdam; it lasted until 
the publication in 1896 of Mr. Bigelow's " History 
of the German Struggle for Liberty," which gave 
offence to the imperial family pride and self- 
esteem. The sprightly character of these remi- 
niscences is greatly enhanced by the author's 
pungent style. 

Fishing and finance, chasing the elusive dollar 
in Wall Street and the wild buffalo on the western 
plains, amassing and losing successive fortunes, 
and between whiles yielding to the call of the 
wild such have been the lifelong activities of 
Mr. Anthony W. Dimock, as narrated by him with 
much vivacity in " Wall Street and the Wilds " 
(Outing Co.). Between a New England boyhood 
as the son of a country parson, and the vicissi- 
tudes of a Wall Street financier dealing in millions 
and controlling steamship companies and telegraph 
lines, the contrast is sharp enough to satisfy any- 
body; and indeed the whole story is one of ups 
and downs, varied by the wholesome delights of 
life in the open. It is a remarkable record and 
an absorbingly interesting one, enlivened to the 
eye by numerous camera views, some of them the 
product of the author's own skill as a photog- 
rapher, in which capacity he is said to have been 
the first to achieve success in photographing live 
wild animals. 

A distinguished Vermonter, son and grandson 
of eminent Vermonters, is introduced to the reader 
in the "Life, Diary, and Letters of Oscar Lovell 
Shafter, Associate Justice Supreme Court of Cali- 
fornia, January 1, 1864, to December 31, 1868." 
The book is further described as " a daughter's 
tribute to a father's memory," and is "edited for 
Emma Shafter-Howard by Flora Haines Lough- 
ead." The subject of the biography was born in 
1812 and died in 1873, so that to younger readers 
this chronicle will seem almost like ancient his- 
tory. But it is related almost wholly in the first 
person, and hence is not without vitality. A long 
list of " decisions written by Judge Shafter " is 
appended. Portraits and other illustrations are 
interspersed. Mr. John J. Newbegin of San Fran- 
cisco publishes the book. 

TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

Certain recent events, as the erection of a Ste- 
venson memorial at Saranac, and the death of 
Dr. Trudeau, Stevenson's physician at that resort 
of consumptives, have directed public attention 
once more to the meteoric course of that rare 
genius during his too-short sojourn on our planet. 
Seasonable, therefore, is the appearance of Mr. 
Clayton Hamilton's " On the Trail of Stevenson " 



(Doubleday), a spacious octavo illustrated by Mr. 
Walter Hale in his well-known skilful and attrac- 
tive manner, and conducting the reader to haunts 
of Stevenson in " Edinburgh, the rest of Scot- 
land, England, France, the rest of Europe, the 
United States." To Vailima and his death-bed the 
author does not follow his hero, honestly con- 
fessing that he has not pursued that trail, but 
holding out hope that " some day we may see the 
Isle of Upolu arising from the sea." It is a good 
book with which to refresh one's memory of 
R. L. S., his rather erratic journeyings, and his 
lovable eccentricities. 

That enthusiastic admirer of and writer on the 
scenic attractions of our great country, Mr. George 
Wharton James, again asks his readers to enjoy 
with him some of these marvels, in a richly illus- 
trated volume entitled " Our American Wonder- 
lands" (McClurg). His purpose, he explains, is, 
" briefly and vividly, without entering into too 
much detail, to give the reader living glimpses of 
what America offers of antiquarian, scenic, geologic, 
and ethnologic interest." Mountain scenery, natu- 
ral bridges, stupendous glaciers, thundering cas- 
cades, prehistoric cliff dwellings, giant trees, native 
tribes and their tribal customs, with much else that 
cannot possibly be seen from a car-window, are 
described and pictured in this alluring volume, 
which the author rightly thinks ought just at this 
time, when Europe is so largely closed to the tour- 
ist, to exert an influence in making Americans see 
America first. A useful map showing the regions 
described covers the end-leaves, the camera views 
are nearly half as many as the pages of the book, 
and an index is added. Mr. James'si especial fit- 
ness for the preparation of such a volume has 
already been more than once demonstrated. 

Like a piece of time-worn tapestry, tattered and 
faded, and here and there showing the stitches of 
an attempted restoration, but a thing of wonder- 
ful beauty nevertheless, Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champ- 
ney's " Romance of Old Belgium " pleases at the 
same time that it awakens regrets. Its sub-title, 
" From Caesar to Kaiser," indicates the scope of 
the work. From dim antiquity it comes down to 
our own day when, as the writer phrases it, we 
"tread the trail of the 'Devastating Hun,' and 
look upon the results of his ' appalling world 
crime.' " Ninety illustrations buildings, ruins, 
portraits, paintings enrich the volume, which 
also draws upon many historical and literary 
sources for its substance. A collaborator, named 
on the title-page as Frere Champney, has assisted 
Mrs. Champney in her work, which is by no means 
the first of the sort from her prolific pen. One 
cannot turn her pages and look at the accompany- 
ing pictures without praying with her that " a 
federation of the world shall establish a universal 
republic, which will make the Game of Kings 
forever impossible." 

Miss Gertrude H. Beggs's " The Four in Crete " 
(Abingdon Press) is the account of a visit from 
Athens to the sites of ancient JEgean civilization 
at Knossos, Phaistos, and Hagia Triada. The 
" four " are " The Western Woman," " The Sage," 
"The Scholar," and "The Coffee Angel." The

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 23 



Scholar's informal and edifying discourses among 
the ruins give the book its body, whose naked use- 
fulness is partially covered and more or less 
adorned with the narrative of such light adventure 
as is usual to travellers in company by sea and 
land in Mediterranean regions. " The Four in 
Crete " is like other double-purpose books : both 
its purposes suffer from the combination. It is 
neither the best entertainment nor the best instruc- 
tion. However, it affords the general reader an 
easy and pleasant, if somewhat slight, means of 
becoming acquainted with the work of Evans and 
Halbherr at their respective sites, and with the 
very interesting life which their discoveries have 
brought to light. The thirty-one illustrations, 
chiefly from " The Western Woman's" camera, are 
very good. 

Languorous delights are by no means the sum 
and substance of Mr. A. Hyatt Verrill's book, 
"Isles of Spice and Palm" (Appleton). He 
maintains that the Lesser Antilles, which are the 
spicy and palmy islands referred to, are more 
bracing in their summer temperature, especially 
among the mountains of the interior, than are 
many of our northern towns, as of course they are 
milder in winter and of a more equable tempera- 
ture at all times. How to enjoy oneself sanely and 
inexpensively in one or more of the crescent of 
islets stretching from Porto Rico to Venezuela is 
agreeably told, with liberal accompaniment of 
illustrations, in this compact volume. Seventy 
pages or more of " facts and figures," alphabeti- 
cally arranged, form a useful appendix, while the 
general information scattered through the book is 
not inconsiderable. 

"Kipling's India," by Dr. Arley Munson, is 
exactly the inviting sort of book implied by the 
title. There are forty-five excellent photographic 
illustrations, with two hundred pages of text giv- 
ing the passages from Kipling associated with the 
scenes depicted. The volume will make many read- 
ers keen to return to their Kipling, and has helped 
to make at least one reviewer keen to return to 
India. The publishers (Doubleday, Page & Co.) 
have given the book a handsome setting. 

ART AND Music. 

The point of view of Mr. Walter A. Dyer in his 
book on "Early American Craftsmen" (Century 
Co.) is that of the collector of antiques who has 
yielded to the reaction towards " Americana " and 
interest in the things produced in the western 
world a century and more ago. His expressed 
intention is to study the crafts of those days 
through the craftsmen who produced the notable 
work of the period. It is a valuable service that 
Mr. Dyer has performed in rescuing from oblivion 
such men as Samuel Mclntire, the master carpen- 
ter of Salem; Duncan Phyfe, the cabinet-maker; 
and the so-called " Baron " Stiegel, maker of beau- 
tiful glass in the Revolutionary period. Of espe- 
cial interest is the record of the many-sided 
interests of Paul Revere, and of the contribution 
which he made to our industrial art history. If Mr. 
Dyer loses sight of the individual craftsmen in 
some of the other chapters, these latter are none 



the less of interest and value to collectors of 
" Americana." Such chapters are those on Duncan 
Phyfe's furniture, on Windsor chairs, clocks made 
by famous clock-makers in Connecticut and else- 
where, Stiegel's glassware, the silver ware of Paul 
Revere, the work of the pewterers and braisiers, 
and the Bennington pottery; all of these contain 
references to existing collections, warnings to col- 
lectors regarding counterfeits, and advice as to 
prices. The volume is profusely illustrated with 
photographic reproductions, chiefly of articles of 
craftsmanship; and in addition there are charm- 
ing little drawings at the beginning and end of 
each chapter. 

Even to an unmusical person Mr. Arthur Elson's 
encyclopaedic work, " The Book of Musical Knowl- 
edge" (Hough ton), is intelligible and interesting. 
It devotes itself to " the history, technique, and 
appreciation of music, together with lives of the 
great composers," is well illustrated, and runs to 
the length of six hundred large pages. In the 
author's words, it " has been written with the idea 
of enabling the non-musician to comprehend the 
real meaning of the tonal art, and to familiarize 
himself with the value of the great composers' 
works, the use of the instruments, the various 
musical forms, and a number of subjects of similar 
importance." Appended are a glossary of musical 
terms, " a course of study, with references," and a 
full index. So comprehensive and popularly use- 
ful a work of this sort, in a single volume, has 
not, to our knowledge, ever before appeared in 
English. 

Such thoroughly Japanese arts as flower- 
arrangement and tea-ceremony are so strange to 
the western world that no little curiosity moves us 
as we open Miss Mary Averill's lavishly illus- 
trated book on "The Flower Art of Japan" 
(Lane), a companion volume to her recent 
" Japanese Flower Arrangement," or, perhaps bet- 
ter, a continuation of that work. There seem to 
be countless schools of this floral art, though that 
called " Ikenobu," dating back twelve hundred 
years, is the one in highest favor. So, at least, we 
infer from the book before us; and it is to this 
school and one other, " Ko-Shin-Ryu," that Miss 
Averill says she owes her greatest inspiration. A 
skilful artist, not named but evidently Japanese, 
has given liberal assistance in making intelligible 
to the reader the fundamentals of flower-arrange- 
ment. There are seventy-five illustrations, of 
which one is in color. 

One hundred and ten grand operas, including, it 
is alleged, all that have been presented in the last 
five seasons in the four opera centres of the east- 
ern United States New York, Chicago, Phila- 
delphia, and Boston and also half a dozen whose 
revival or first production in this country is an- 
nounced for the coming season, are given in out- 
line by Miss Edith B. Ordway in " The Opera 
Book" (Sully & Kleinteich). The story of each 
is told act by act, each is characterized as tragic, 
comic, fairy, allegorical, sentimental, or heroic; 
but all are classed under " grand " opera inasmuch 
as every word is sung and the recitative is usually

accompanied by the orchestra. Useful and care- 
fully verified data are given (not is given, as the 
preface announces) under each title, portraits of 
famous singers in costume are inserted, a list of 
composers is added, and welcome aids to the pro- 
nunciation of foreign names find a place both in 
the body of the book and in the concluding inde^x. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Unique in every aspect among the season's gift- 
books is a thin quarto entitled " The Ballet of the 
Nations" (Putnam), by the distinguished writer 
known as " Vernon Lee." Described on the title- 
page as " a present-day morality," the text is a 
powerfully caustic allegory in which the Great 
War is presented as a grand ballet, staged by 
Death, with Satan for impresario. The orchestra 
is first assembled. Fear, with " her shabby rest- 
less twins," Suspicion and Panic, take their places; 
" my Lady Idealism and my young Prince Adven- 
ture" are next induced to join; "Sin, whom the 
gods call Disease," with her attendant crew of 
Rapine, Lust, Murder, and Famine, are not 
long in following; and next come Hatred with 
Self -Righteousness, "who pretend not to be 
acquainted." Two late-comers, Madam Science and 
Councillor Organization, at first taken by Ballet- 
Master Death for alien spies, are soon recognized 
as indispensable collaborators. Lastly appears 
Heroism, the foremost musician of them all. The 
nations then assemble, and to the compelling 
strains of the orchestra of human passions they 
begin their wild dance, in which they mutilate and 
dismember one another. As their efforts flag 
through exhaustion, Impresario Satan cunningly 
introduces two fresh musicians, Pity and Indigna- 
tion, whose stirring notes revive the dancers to a 
new and madder frenzy of mutual extermination. 
This is only the baldest outline of what is truly a 
masterpiece of satiric allegory. The very essence 
of the present war, stripped of its cloak of surface 
appearances and befuddling sophistries, is here 
presented. A fitting and artistic " pictorial accom- 
paniment" is provided by Maxwell Armfield in a 
series of decorative page borders, printed in red, 
and done in the manner of old Greek vase paint- 
ings. There is a striking cover design as well. 

Camera views, some in color, of notable private 
gardens in many parts of our broad land make up 
the bulk of Miss Louise Shelton's sumptuous 
quarto, "Beautiful Gardens in America" (Serib- 
ner). Vancouver Island, just beyond our border, 
is represented by two illustrations, and even 
Alaska has a brief chapter to itself, though no 
Alaskan gardens find place among the pictures. 
Imitations of European horticultural formalism, 
heavily adorned with marble or other stone con- 
structions, have been for the most part excluded 
from the book, which is designed " to present, more 
particularly, another type of garden, demonstrat- 
ing the cultured American's love of beauty ex- 
pressed through plant life rather than in stone." 
The garden as expressive of personality has been 
the quest of the compiler, and a good measure of 
success has attended her search. 



Striking in its title and thought-evoking in its 
contents, Mr. Stephen Graham's latest book, " The 
Way of Martha and the Way of Mary " (Macmil- 
lan) is characterized by him as " an interpretation 
and a survey of Eastern Christianity, and a con- 
sideration of the ideas at present to the fore in 
Christianity generally." It is also, as its name 
implies, a book of contrasts: the way of Martha 
he considers to be the way of the West, that of 
Mary the way of the East. By the East the author 
means preeminently Russia. In Russia, which he 
knows as few Englishmen know that country, his 
book seems to have been written, and it contributes 
not a little to our knowledge of things Russian. 
Its breadth of view may be illustrated by this 
utterance, with which the volume closes : " So two 
churches combine to make one truth, and the hand- 
maidens of the Lord, Martha and Mary, are shown 
to be indeed two sisters, not only in kindred but 
in spirit." 

Twenty-two years ago Mrs. William Starr 
Dana rendered a service to American flower-lovers 
who were not also expert botanists by issuing a 
manual that has since been taken as a model by 
many successful imitators of Mrs. Dana's method. 
" Wild Flowers of the North American Moun- 
tains" (McBride), by Mrs. Julia W. Henshaw, is 
the latest successor to " How to Know the Wild 
Flowers," its arrangement of the flowers in color- 
groups, its preliminary aids, its index to scientific 
names, and its list of common names, all being 
very much in the manner of that pioneer work. 
But it should be added in its praise that it goes a 
step further: it has many strikingly beautiful 
colored plates in addition to the simple half-tones, 
and it devotes forty-four pages to a " general key 
to the families." The ferns and fern-allies, the 
trees, and the reeds, grasses, sedges, and rushes are 
taken up before the more important and more 
numerous flowering plants proper, these last, as 
already indicated, being roughly grouped accord- 
ing to color for the convenience of the laity. It is 
a valuable supplement, with some inevitable over- 
lappings, to earlier works of like character; and 
within its own domain it can well stand alone on 
its peculiar merits. 

Few have practised more industriously or suc- 
cessfully than Mr. Clifton Johnson the art of 
interviewing our country folk and reproducing the 
results in literary form, as is abundantly shown in 
his series of American travel books. Now he offers 
fresh proof of his skill by bringing forth a vol- 
ume of eye-witness accounts, taken for the most 
part from the lips of rustic narrators on or near 
the scene of action, of " Battleground Adventures 
in the Civil War" (Hough ton), a book that will 
appeal strongly to boys and also to many older 
readers, especially those whose recollections go 
back to war times. His quest for original material 
has taken him to Harper's "Ferry, Bull Run, Shiloh, 
Antietam, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Yicksburg, 
Chickaniauga, Lookout Mountain and Missionary 
Ridge, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, Atlanta, and 
the Shenandoah Valley. Aged men and women, 
white and black, have been called upon to revive 
their memories of the great conflict of half a cen-

tury ago; and if it be true that nothing so con- 
duces to peace as a full recognition of the horrors 
of war, the book is a fit offering at this Christmas 
season. Mr. Rodney Thomson vividly illustrates it 
with colored drawings. 

With the new year it will be half a century since 
" The Dream of Gerontius " came from Cardinal 
Newman's hand, a noble poem barely saved from 
the waste-paper basket by a discerning intercessor, 
as the perhaps mythical account of its origin would 
have us believe. Fitting enough is it, at any rate, 
that the poem should have a semi-centennial re- 
issue in worthy form, and this re-issue is to be 
noted among the season's publications of the John 
Lane Co. Miss Stella Langdale illustrates the vol- 
ume with ten drawings that well reflect the senti- 
ment of the poem, and Mr. Gordon Tidy writes a 
bibliographic and appreciative introduction that 
fills half the book. It is safe to say that no pre- 
vious edition of this fine product of Newman's 
genius can compare with the present one. 

Lincoln's lyceum lecture of 1860 on " Discoveries 
and Inventions," a discourse delivered by him in 
various places about Springfield, Illinois, and in 
Springfield itself, a short time before his call to 
far more arduous duties than lecturing to rural 
audiences, is now for the first time made into a 
book all by itself and offered for sale by Mr. 
John Howell of San Francisco. Its interest for 
us now lies chiefly in its revelation of its writer's 
range of reading and inquiry, in the proof it offers 
of his debt to the Bible for both thought and lan- 
guage, and in its excellence as an example of his 
clear and simple and at the same time sufficiently 
ornate, sufficiently picturesque mode of expression. 
A " prefatory note " gives the interesting history 
of the original manuscript of this lecture, and from 
that manuscript the lecture is printed. 

Mr. Ian Hay, or, to be accurate, Captain Ian 
Hay Beith of the Argyll and Sutherland High- 
landers, wrote not very long ago some lifelike 
sketches of schoolboy life for " Blackwood's Maga- 
zine," and they are now gathered into a book and 
named, collectively, " The Lighter Side of School 
Life." Mr. Lewis Baumer furnishes a dozen good 
pastel drawings, here reproduced in color, to ac- 
company the tales or sketches, and the whole makes 
an excellent contribution to a class of literature 
that has been deservedly popular ever since Tom 
Brown of Rugby came into being. This book is 
published in America by Mr. LeRoy Phillips of 
Boston. It is a good gift-book for young or old. 
In the cab of a monster express engine, amid the 
glare and heat and din of a steel foundry, at the 
side of a leviathan of the deep just starting down 
the ways, in the power-house of a great electric 
plant, on the dizzy staging of a skyscraper in 
course of construction, and in divers other more or 
less perilous and exciting positions, Mr. Joseph 
Husband has gathered the material for his 
"America at Work" (Houghton), a realistic 
presentation of the toils and struggles and dangers 
of men who wrestle with the forces not only of 
nature, but of nature and human inventiveness 
combined. The author will be remembered as the 



narrator of " A Yean in a Coal Mine," and this 
second essay in the romance of industry will not 
lessen his popularity. 

He who seeks to array his soul, as Plato ex- 
presses it, in her own proper jewels, which are 
temperance, justice, courage, nobility, and truth, 
will find help in Dr. Elwood Worcester's little 
book, " The Issues of Life " (Moffat). Nine years' 
experience in watching the moral and physical 
regenerative effects of high thinking has qualified 
the author to speak with understanding and per- 
suasiveness on such topics as the following (from 
the book's table of contents) : " Keeping Our 
Hearts," " Thought and Work," " The Loneliness 
of the Soul," "Revelations," "Our Spiritual 
Faculties," and "Religion and Neglect." To all 
devout souls the essence of religion is the same; 
hence the cordial assent which thousands of read- 
ers of nominally different creeds will be able to 
give to the truth stated with the force of personal 
experience by the Rector of Emmanuel Church. 

Three hundred and sixty-five little sermons, each 
a page long or less, and each assigned to a par- 
ticular day of the year, with a bit of verse instead 
of a sermon for Christmas, make up the contents 
of the gift-book entitled " Every Day " (American 
Tract Society), by Mr. Edgar Whitaker Work. 
Each discourse is headed by a scriptural quotation 
from which it takes its keynote, and the admirable 
quality of brevity, of pithy compactness, marks 
every one of these sermonettes.

Imogen Guiney, and later writers, has been com- 
piled by Mr. Lincoln Newton Kinnicutt, and enti- 
tled " To Your Dog and to My Dog " (Houghton). 
Fine linen paper, broad margins, frequent blank 
pages for the insertion of additional poems, a 
space reserved on the cover for the portrait of 
one's own dog these and other material details 
combine to make the volume pleasing to the eye 
and acceptable to the book-lover. A preface to 
the " dear dogs " explains the compiler's purpose 
and shows him to be a discerning appreciator of 
canine excellence. 

A group of little books more or less appropriate 
to the Christmas season, and all suitable as Christ- 
mas gifts, must here be noticed with extreme brev- 
ity. Mr. Harold Speakman illustrates in color and 
decorates in gilt "The First Christmas" (Abing- 
don Press), being the scriptural account of the 
birth of Christ. The book is a little gem of art, 
beautifully printed and pleasing in every respect. 
"The Glad Hand, and Other Grips on Life" 
(McClurg), by Mr. Humphrey J. Desmond, com- 
bines the cheeriness expected and desired at this 
season with the reflective wisdom welcome at all 
times. Its arrangement is by non-consecutive 
paragraphs grouped under nine headings, sugges- 
tive of the "infinitely repellent particles" of 
Emerson's essays. A diverting little book has been 
made by Mr. Laurens Maynard in the shape of a 
collection of poems having to do with evolution.

" Evolution : A Fantasy," by Mr. Langdon Smith, 
opens the book and gives it its title; and this 
familiar skit (it begins, " When you were a tad- 
pole and I was a fish") is followed by a variety 
of verses, both frolicsome and serious, by various 
authors. (John W. Luce & Co.). "Cupid's 
Capers " (Button) is a book of rollicking verse by 
Miss Lillian Gardner, illustrated in color, and 
amusingly descriptive of the pleasures and pains 
of love. Mrs. Helen S. Woodruff's Christmas 
story is this year entitled " Mr. Doctor Man " 
(Doran), being the tale of a philanthropic physi- 
cian who, after years of unselfish service, finds his 
old sweetheart, and all ends happily. A winsome 
child patient plays a leading part in the little 
drama, and it is for the benefit of children's hos- 
pitals that the book is written and published. 
" The Folly of the Three Wise Men " (Doran), by 
Mr. Edgar Whitaker Work, is a variant of the 
familiar legend of the following of the star to find 
the new-born Messiah. Because these wise men 
were too eager in their pursuit to pause even for 
the simplest offices of charity they nearly failed in 
their quest; but the appeal of a forlorn little 
shepherd boy, lost and hurt, saves them. The 
story is illustrated and decorated. A love story 
of the Kansas prairie is well told by Miss Mar- 
garet Hill McCarter in "The Corner Stone" 
(McClurg), in which Edith Grannell and Homer 
Helm seem fair in each other's eyes and, after cer- 
tain difficulties and misunderstandings have been 
overcome and cleared away, are happily wedded. 
The little book is daintily decorated, has a colored 
frontispiece, and is artistically boxed. " Into His 
Own " (McKay) is a dog story by Mr. Clarence 
B. Kelland, who follows the fortunes of a thor- 
oughbred Airedale from a despised puppyhood to 
an honored maturity, telling the tale in the first 
person, from the dog-hero's point of view. It is a 
touching story, well told, and adorned with the 
Airedale's portrait, photographed from life. A 
pathetic tale in dialect, with title in dialect, 
"When Hannah Var Eight Yar Old" (Stokes), 
is told by Mrs. Katherine Peabody Girling. Han- 
nah, a Swedish girl, is made to describe her hard 
experiences during her mother's illness and after 
her death, in the home country, before Hannah, 
"a big girl eight yar old," came to America. It 
is a story of humble heroism that goes to the read- 
er's heart. Illustrations and decorations increase 
its attractiveness to the eye. " The Man Who 
Was Too Busy to Find the Child" (Abingdon 
Press), by Mr. Lucius H. Bugbee, is the story of 
Ben David, who was blind and deaf to his blessed 
opportunities until, on the very day of the cruci- 
fixion, he awoke to a sense of his obtuseness. The 
obvious moral stands out clearly. Two illustra- 
tions are inserted, and an ornamental paper cover 
encloses the score of pages containing the story. 
Captain Ian Hay Beith, better known as Ian Hay, 
chronicles the history of "Scally" (Houghton), 
which is sub-titled " The Story of a Perfect Gen- 
tleman." Excalibur is the full name of the hero, 
who is a dog, snatched from a watery grave in 
puppyhood. His memorable deeds, with a love- 
story interwoven, fill nine short chapters, and many 



readers will wish there were more. Scally is por- 
trayed in the frontispiece. An animal story of a 
different sort, entitled "The Little Red Doe" 
(Little, Brown & Co.), by Mr. Chauncy J. Haw- 
kins, gives us the life and doings and pathetic 
death of a very ingratiating creature of the Maine 
forest, with excellent pictures by Mr. Charles Cope- 
land. Rough lumbermen are softened by their 
feeling for the little red doe, and gallantly resolve 
to avenge her death; whereby hangs a tale too 
long to be given here. Mrs. Mary Raymond Ship- 
man Andrews's war story, " The Three Things," 
having won success in less permanent shape, now 
comes out in book form from the publishing house 
of Little, Brown & Co. Class pride, unbelief, and 
race prejudice were the three things not quite as 
they should have been in the hero, Philip Landi- 
cutt, who however had such passionate pity for the 
oppressed that he threw himself into the struggle 
for Belgium's emancipation, and there lost his 
class pride, his unbelief, his race prejudice. Other 
events, too, enrich the story, which furthermore has 
the merit of brevity, being but little more than 
fifty pages in length. "Robin the Bobbin" 
(Harper), by a writer designated as "Vale Dow- 
nie," is the story of a blind piano-tuner, an elderly 
and (wonderful to relate) rich inventor, a boy, 
Tom Bunting, who turns out to be the lost Robin, 
and a few other characters. The mystery and the 
interest centre themselves in the boy Tom, and of 
course all is cleared up in the end, and everyone is 
happy. Two pictures enliven the narrative. 
New England stories are almost invariable favor- 
ites with readers, provided they are well told, and 
it is safe to predict that "Blue Gingham Folks" 
(Abingdon Press), by Miss Dorothy Donnell Cal- 
houn, will receive the appreciation it deserves. It 
is a collection of Yankee tales, character sketches 
they might perhaps better be called, with a flavor 
that is genuinely New England. Local dialect 
abounds, and a few drawings help to make the 
reader better acquainted with the various person- 
ages of the book. In " The Heart of Lincoln " 
(Jacobs) we have a series of more or less authen- 
tic anecdotes and reminiscences concerning the 
War President. They illustrate the warmth and 
tenderness of his feelings, and make him a very 
Tinman, very lovable person. Mr. Wayne Whipple 
is the compiler, and an unnamed artist supplies a 
portrait of Lincoln. " Jimsy the Christmas Kid " 
(McBride) is a typical Christmas tale. In it Miss 
Leona Dalrymple relates the adventures of a waif 
who wins the hearts of a crusty bank-president and 
his amiable wife, and is finally received into the 
family as a permanent resident. The little volume 
is attractively illustrated and beautifully decorated. 
Mr. Irvin S. Cobb, home from the war and 
temporarily out of more thrilling themes, turns to 
amusing account his attack of appendicitis and the 
operation therefor. " Speaking of Operations " 
(Doran) makes the most of the rather abundant 
opportunity for sarcastic and facetious comment 
that is offered to a shrewdly observant surgical 
patient in an up-to-date hospital; and it does so 
with the help of illustrations almost as provocative 
of smiles as is the little story itself.

[ Dec. 23 



NOTES. 



" The Note-Book of a Neutral," by Mr. Joseph 
Medill Patterson, is announced for immediate pub- 
lication by Messrs. Duffield. 

" Justice in War Time," by Mr. Bertrand Rus- 
sell, is a volume promised for early publication by 
the Open Court Publishing Co. 

A new novel by Mr. Henry Kitchell Webster, 
entitled " The Real Adventure," is scheduled for 
early issue by the Bobbs-Merrill Co. 

"The Stranger's Wedding" is the title of a 
forthcoming novel by Mr. W. L. George, which 
Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. will issue. 

A new volume of verse by Mr. Lee Wilson Dodd, 
" The Middle Miles, and Other Poems," will come 
shortly from the Yale University Pr^ess. 

A volume of plays by Mr. Theodore Dreiser, 
entitled " Plays of the Natural and Supernatural," 
will be issued by John Lane Co. in January. 

" The Foreign Relations of the United States," 
by Professor Willis Fletcher Johnson, is an his- 
torical work announced for publication early in 
the new year by the Century Co. 

Miss Viola Meynell has finished a new novel, 
"Narcissus," to be published early in January. 
During that month also will appear Mr. Hugh 
Walpole's new novel, " The Dark Forest," an out- 
come of the author's recent experiences at the 
Russian scene of action. 

Among other new importations of the house of 
Scribner the following are promised : " Form 
and Colour," by Mr. Lisle March Phillipps ; " A 
Frenchman's Thoughts on the War," by M. Paul 
Sabatier; and " A Short History of English Rural 
Life," by Mr. Montague Fordham. 

Miss Marie Van Vorst, who has been delivering 
lectures in America for the benefit of the American 
Ambulance in France, has written an account of 
her personal work with the Red Cross, which John 
Lane Co. will publish shortly under the title, 
" War Letters of an American Woman." 

Among other volumes immediately forthcoming 
from the Oxford University Press are : " The 
Evolution of Prussia," by Messrs. J. A. R. Mar- 
riott and C. Grant Robertson; an illustrated 
edition of Reade's " The Cloister and the Hearth " ; 
and " The Rise of English Literary Prose," by 
Mr. George Philip Krapp. 

Mr. George Moore has in preparation a romance 
of the Holy Land entitled " The Brook Kerith," 
which has for its principal characters Jesus Christ, 
Paul of Tarsus, and Joseph of Arimathea. The 
story is written around legends which have been 
current for many centuries, though not to be 
found in the Gospels, and the local color was 
drawn by the author on the spot. 

A psychological contribution to the literature of 
the war will shortly be published in a work entitled 
" War and the Ideal of Peace," described in the sub- 
title as " a study of those characteristics of man 
that result in war, and of the means by which they 
may be controlled," by Dr. H. Rutgers Marshall. 



The author discusses, among other problems, " The 
Law of Strife and the Ideal of Peace," <' The 
Moral and Religious Issues," and " Natural Law 
and Creativeness." 

Among the elaborately illustrated gift-books of 
the season are the following, published by Messrs. 
Doran: "Picture Book for the French Red 
Cross," illustrated in color by Mr. Edmund Dulac, 
with verses translated from the Old French and 
tales from the " Arabian Nights " ; " Rabbi Ben 
Ezra, and Other Poems from Robert Browning," 
illustrated by Mr. Bernard Partridge ; and " The 
Book of Old English Songs and Ballads," illus- 
trated in color by Miss Eleanor F. Brickdale. 

An exhaustive study of " Lombard Architec-. 
ture," by Mr. Arthur Kingsley Porter, is to be 
published by the Yale University Press in four 
volumes. The first of these, consisting of plates, 
mostly from photographs taken by the author, is 
now nearly ready. The three remaining volumes 
will be devoted to text. One phase of the subject 
was dealt with by the author in a volume issued by 
the same press in 1911 under the title " The Con- 
struction of Lombard and Gothic Vaults." 

"Letters from America" by the late Rupert 
Brooke is announced for immediate publication by 
Messrs. Scribner. These letters were written to an 
English newspaper two or three years ago, and in 
the volume is included a paper written at the out- 
break of the war, and giving a glimpse of the 
effect of the sudden crisis on the mind of a young 
Englishman. A sympathetic Introduction and 
appreciation is furnished by Mr. Henry James, 
and the frontispiece consists of a new portrait in 
photogravure. 

Mr. A. H. de Tremaudan has written an account 
of the Hudson Bay Railway, now. under construc- 
tion between Pass Manitoba to Port Nelson, which 
Messrs. Dutton will publish under the title, " The 
Hudson Bay Road." Among other volumes soon 
to come from the same house are : " The Appeal 
of the Picture," by Mr. F. C. Tilney; " Elef- 
therios Venizelos: His Life and His Work," by 
Dr. G. Kerofilos ; and " Old Familiar Faces " and 
" Poetry and the Renascence of Wonder," by Mr. 
Theodore Watts-Dunton. 

The immediately forthcoming books of Messrs. 
Putnam include a study of " Social Freedom," by 
Elsie Clews Parsons, who, as in her earlier books 
on "The Family" and "The Old-Fashioned 
Woman," draws freely on the customs and regula- 
tions of earlier and primitive societies by way of 
comparison or contrast with existing conditions; 
" Curiosities in Proverbs," by Mr. Dwight Ed- 
wards Marvin, containing over 2000 translated 
folk-sayings, gathered from seventy and more lan- 
guages and dialects, with explanatory notes, lists 
of allied phrases, and an introductory essay on the 
proverbs of the world ; and " Chinese Art Motives 
Interpreted," by Winifred Reed Tredwell, an illus- 
trated book on the life that underlies Chinese art, 
illustrated with examples from well-known collec- 
tions. 

A loss to English poetry is reported from En- 
gland in the death on Dec. 9 of Stephen Phillips, 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



known to theatre-goers as well as to readers for 
his successful " Paolo and Francesca," if for noth- 
ing else. Some fifteen poetic and dramatic com- 
positions, however, besides his volume of poems 
that received the "Academy " one-hundred-pound 
prize in 1897, stand to his credit, among them 
being " Christ in Hades," which first arrested the 
attention of watchful critics, " Herod," " Ulysses," 
" The Sin of David," " Nero," " The Last Heir," 
"Pietro of Siena," "The King," " lole," and 
"Panama and Other Poems," most of these being 
in dramatic form, and some of them tested as to 
their stage merits by actual presentation. Mr. 
Phillips was well qualified to write for the stage 
since he had, in his first and only term at Queen's 
College, Cambridge, cut loose from academic re- 
straints and joined Mr. Frank Benson's company 
of players when it chanced to visit the town ; and 
for six years he played various small parts with 
this company. His previous schooling had been at 
Stratford and Peterborough, his father, the Rev. 
Stephen Phillips, D.D., being Precentor of Peter- 
borough Cathedral. To complete this reversed 
biography, he was born at Somertown, near Ox- 
ford, July 28, 1868, and was thus in the prime of 
life when death overtook him. Though his later 
books evidenced a sad decline in poetic power, the 
author of such works as " Paolo and Francesca " 
and " Marpessa " will long hold a secure place in 
the annals of English poetry. 

The following appeal for a Tennyson Memorial 
appears in a recent issue of the London " Times," 
signed by several notable names : " The Com- 
mittee of the Public Library at Lincoln are will- 
ing and it is their own suggestion to set apart 
a room to become the home for Tennyson Manu- 
scripts, early and other editions of the poems, por- 
traits, busts, personal relics, &c., somewhat in the 
same manner as has been done so successfully in 
the case of Wordsworth at Dove Cottage, Gras- 
mere. It is believed that if it were known that 
such a centre was established, many admirers of 
Tennyson would be glad to send some gift which 
would increase the value of the collection and make 
it worthy of a visit by lovers and students of the 
poet from all parts of the Empire. This is no 
time to ask for money; and only very slight 
expenditure is contemplated. But it is a time to 
suggest that in his memory who wrote the Ode on 
the Death of the Duke of Wellington, the Charge 
of the Light and Heavy Brigades, the Relief of 
Lucknow, The Revenge, and many other patriotic 
verses, lovers of Tennyson should be invited to 
give or lend some suitable contributions to a cen- 
tral Tennyson Museum in the capital town of his 
native county. Gifts will be received and ac- 
knowledged by the Librarian Mr. A. R. Corns 
Public Library, Lincoln; and it would be well 
that before sending gifts the committee should be 
consulted through him, for space is limited. We 
hope that many objects of first-rate interest and 
importance will be enshrined in what will, we 
believe, become in time a very notable Tennyson 
Collection. The proposal has the approval of 
Lord Tennyson, who has already sent a number of 
valuable loans."

The Yale Review 

The New American Qua -terly 

is not a Yale University review. It is an Ameri- 
can review. More even than an American review, 
it is a cosmopolitan review, and that of the high- 
est order. 

Its articles on foreign affairs and American politics, 
the literary essays, the brilliant discussions of the 
theatre, peace and war, feminism and the press, 
have already won attention both in this country 
and abroad. 

"Here is a variety of good, sound stuff for studious 
reading, a little library in itself .... There is 
nothing better of its kind and class, that we know of,

ENTIRE CIVILIZATION OF THESE

THE CIVILIZATION 

OF BABYLONIA 

AND ASSYRIA 

Its Remains, Language, History, Religion 
Commerce, Law, Art and Literature 

By MORRIS JASTROW, Jr., Ph.D., LL.D. 

(University of Pennsylvania) 

With a map and 164 illustrations. Octavo, $6 net. 

Prof. Morris Jastrow, Jr., has devoted his career to the 
study of the ancient Orient, and authorizes us to say that 
this book represents, in a measure, a summary of his life's 
work. Under his guidance readers will be able to follow 
the course taken by the remarkable civilization that ex- 
tended its influence through the entire ancient world. It 
is a comprehensive and complete survey of the subject, of 
deep interest to the general reader, the historian, anthro- 
pologist, and sociologist. The pictures show every aspect 
of this civilization, which alone disputes that of Egypt to 
being the oldest of the world. For bible scholars the com- 
parisons with Hebrew traditions and records will have 
intense interest.
