Real Experiences on the Trail 

The Log of a Cowboy 

By Andy Adams. $1.50. 



"The real thing . . . racy of the soil and 
carries its own certificate of first hand knowl- 
edge on every page." 

— Chicago Record- Herald. 

" It is all so vivid, so life-like, so full of mean- 
ing and purpose that one can see that here is no 
fancy sketch or spinnings of the imagination. 
It is as literal as the cattle trail itself, and 
hence it is a human document of rare interest 
and value." — Brooklyn Eagle. 



•• The rich and absorbing story of old trail 

days, written with simple power of directness." 

— St. Paid Dispatch. 

" It holds the mind from beginning to end, 
leaving one with the wish that the trail had 
been longer, and the conviction that many a re- 
reading will find it always new." 

— Boston Journal. 

"A rare and shining example of the real thing 
in book form." — Chicago Inter Ocean.

An Ivory Trader in North Kenia : 

The Record of an Expedition through Ki-

Burkeneji Tribes 

" By A. Arkell-Hakdwick, F.R.G.S. With 23 
Illustrations from Photographs, and a Map. 8vo. 
$5.00. 

" We sincerely hope that for the pleasure of his fellow men Mr. 
Arkell-Hardwick will continue his adventurous journeys, emerge 
safely from their shadows, and write books about them. He is one 
of the most pleasant of story-tellers, and Africa's own witchery 
lurks in his ink-horn. . . . We can only sum up by saying that he 
has given us a permanent addition to the library of travel and one 
to be placed in its brightest and most entertaining section." — Pall 
Mall Gazette.

of " Some Experiences of an Irish R. M. " With Il- 
lustrations by E. (E. Sommerville. Crown 8vo. $1.50. 
" Eleven capital Irish sketches — racy, light-hearted, and high- 
spirited, without anything of the clownishly boisterous. Both au- 
thors love horses and dogs, and the artist can draw them. The 
rustic types, natural in their brogue and modes of thought, are a 
picture-gallery of clever vignettes. " — Outlook (London).

8vo, pp. xviii.-312. $3.60 net. 



Primal Law 

By 
J. J. Atkinson. 
By mail, $3.80. 



Mr. ATKINSON'S work deals with his theories as to the origins 
of human society, and especially as to the marriage relation. These 
are based on his knowledge of the natives of New Caledonia, among 
whom he spent nearly the whole of his life. Mr. LANG has edited 
this part of the book, and his own part of it is of the nature of intro- 
duction and commentary.

Mr. HAGGARD'S New Novel 
Pearl=Maiden A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem 

By H. Rider Haggard. With 26 Illustrations by Byam Shaw. Crown 8vo, Cloth, Ornamental. $1.50.

A New Volume in the Literatures of the World ^Series, Edited by Edmund Gosse. 

Professor Trent's main effort has been to show how wide and on the whole successful the efforts 

of American writers have been ever since the planting of the colonies. He makes, however, no

LITER A TUBE ILL USTRA TED. 



On the principle that good wine needs no 
bush, the illustration of literature would seem 
to be a work of supererogation. While it is 
theoretically true that pictorial art may prop- 
erly be employed for the elucidation of literary 
art, and while this dual alliance is occasionally 
brought to a successful issue, yet it must be 
confessed that as a general rule the divergence 
of aim and method is so great that the mutual 
heightening of effect to be desired is not achieved. 
Each kind of art may be good in its own way, 
but neither artist has so penetrated into the 
consciousness of the other as to become truly 
interpretative of his work, or entirely sympa- 



thetic in the expression of his spirit. The 
illustrator plays about the text, or, in the less 
common reverse case, the writer plays about 
the picture ; but in neither case is the relation 
other than external, and a genuine interfusion 
of the two idealisms is rarely accomplished. 

When the poet or the novelist becomes his 
own illustrator, a successful marriage of the 
two arts is of course possible, provided that 
the writer be not a mere amateur in design. 
The case of Rossetti naturally comes to mind 
as the one conspicuous modern instance of the 
two forms of genius united in one personality. 
One of Rossetti's sonnets illustrated by one of 
his own drawings offers a perfect example of 
the two arts in happy conjunction. But the 
case of Rossetti is almost unique, for it is gen- 
erally true that pictures for poems are not the 
work of poets, and that poems for pictures are 
penned by hands that have had no practice in 
the use of the brush. If the pictorial art is to 
stand in its ideal relation to the literature with 
which it is occupied, it must be more than the 
mere complement of the printed page ; it must 
add to the meaning of the text, and must in 
turn be itself illuminated by that text. In a 
word, each of the arts thus allied must have a 
far deeper meaning when taken in connection 
with the other than it could possibly have when 
standing by itself. 

Mr. Tedder's series of illustrations made 
for FitzGerald's paraphrase of Omar affords an 
extraordinary example of what it is possible 
for a painter of genius to do for a poet. These 
noble drawings might well claim recognition 
on their own account, but their impressiveness is 
raised to the second power through their asso- 
ciation with the quatrains of the Tent-Maker. 
And it is hardly too much to say that the im- 
pressiveness of the quatrains is similarly raised 
through their association with the drawings. 
But here again we have the exceptional in- 
stance, which serves only to make more glaring 
the shortcomings of all ordinary attempts to 
produce pictures that shall suitably interpret 
works of literary art. Even when we get good 
designs for good literature, as with Flaxman 
and Dante, Kaulbach and Goethe, Cruikshank 
and Dickens, we are somehow made uncomfort- 
ably conscious that the one form of expression 
does not fit in with the other. And we do not

[July 1, 



always get even this. Sometimes an artist of 
genius will waste his powers upon the illus- 
tration of a third-rate text, and we get such a 
production as Blair's " The Grave " illustrated 
by Blake, which we prize only for the drawings, 
which never tempts us to read the words sup- 
posed to have been their inspiration. On the 
other hand, we sometimes find a great master- 
piece of literature cheapened — as far as such 
a thing is possible — by sensational and mer- 
etricious illustration, of which the most con- 
spicuous modern instance is offered by Dore's 
drawings for Dante, Milton, and the Bible. 
These examples will show sufficiently for our 
present purpose how hazardous a thing it is to 
enlist the one art in the service of the other, 
and how frequently the result of so doing is a 
product that must be called incongruous, even 
if we spare it a harsher name. 

But if the illustration of literature is a ques- 
tionable procedure, it is quite otherwise with 
the illustration of the history of literature. 
That history, while primarily concerned with 
the writings that are cherished by mankind for 
their artistic form or their intellectual grasp, 
must also be concerned to a considerable extent 
with such matters as the personal characters, 
the biography, the homes and haunts, the man- 
ners and customs, and the historical setting of 
the authors dealt with. And, like all the other 
aspects of the history of culture, its interest 
may be greatly enhanced by judicious illustra- 
tion. The history of literature is apt to be dry 
stuff at best, unless illuminated at many points 
by light from the well-stored mind of the read- 
er, and every device should be welcomed that 
tends to make it inherently attractive. This 
principle has long been given practical recog- 
nition by the European writers in this field, 
and nearly every nation of the Continent has 
produced a richly illustrated history of its lit- 
erature, supplementing a scholarly text with a 
great variety of pictorial adornment. Books of 
this class have been of incalculable benefit in 
popularizing literary study, and they have ac- 
complished their purpose in a strictly legitimate 
way, without lapsing unworthily from the 
dignity of their theme. 

A work of this type, dealing with the fifteen 
hundred years of English literature, has long 
been desirable, and it is a wonder that we should 
have had to wait until the twentieth century for 
its performance. Such a work is at last in pro- 
cess of publication, undertaken by competent 
hands, and we give it the most cordial welcome. 
There are to be four volumes altogether, the first 



of them, extending from the Old English period 
to the time of Henry VIII., being the work of 
Dr. Richard Garnett. The remaining three 
have been entrusted to Mr. Edmund Gosse. 
Dr. Garnett's volume, and the second of Mr. 
Gosse's three, covering the period from Milton 
to Johnson, are already at hand ; the two others 
are promised for autumn publication. For this 
praiseworthy enterprise Mr. William Heine- 
mann is primarily responsible, and the publica- 
tion for the United States is in the hands of the 
Macmillan Co. The mechanical execution of 
the work is sumptuous, and in beauty of typo- 
graphy and illustration the volumes leave little 
to be desired. They are open to criticism only 
on account of their extreme bulkiness, which 
results from the use of heavy glazed paper al- 
most as thick as cardboard. We believe that 
the publishers would have been well-advised to 
use paper of half the thickness, and to present 
the work in two volumes instead of four. 

Among the illustrative features of this work, 
portraiture naturally occupies the place of first 
importance. For the earlier centuries of the 
history, this material is of course meagre and 
of doubtful authenticity, but from Chaucer on- 
ward we have portraits in abundance, although 
there must remain serious gaps in complete- 
ness all the way through the Elizabethan period. 
When we come to the age of Milton and the 
eighteenth century, there is no serious lack of 
material, and the third volume presents us with 
a superb series of plates in process and photo- 
gravure that are a delight to the eye. The 
lack of portrait interest in the first volume is, 
however, more than compensated for by the 
use of manuscript facsimiles, many of them 
illuminated. The richest treasures of the muse- 
ums and libraries have been drawn upon for 
these reproductions. Autograph letters are 
also reproduced in great numbers, and pages of 
holograph illustrating the choicest examples of 
our literature. Title-pages of historical interest 
and old wood-cuts are also supplied in great 
profusion. The homes of authors, the places 
associated with them, and the many buildings 
and monuments that have a quasi-literary in- 
terest are pictured for us by hundreds. Such 
things as coins, seals, effigies, old bindings, 
and musical scores are not neglected. There 
are also a number of illustrations of the mod- 
ern imaginative type, such as a page from the 
Keltnscott Chaucer, and Stothard's picture of 
the Canterbury Pilgrims. In short, nothing 
seems to have been omitted that could in any 
way lend itself to the illustration of this aspect

of history, and help to make vivid the lives, 
the personalities, and the surroundings, of the 
men whose names are remembered in our 
literature. 

Of the accompanying text, we may say 
briefly that it is competent and pleasing. 
Both Dr. Garnett and Mr. Gosse are graceful 
writers, and neither of them is now dealing for 
the first time with his material. Three sizes 
of type are used ; the largest for the running 
commentary which is the substance of the 
work, a smaller size for the biographies, and 
one still smaller and closer for the extracts. 
These extracts are well-chosen and typical, but 
do not encroach too bulkily upon the narrative 
and descriptive text. The plan of the text as 
a whole has a balance and a proportion that 
have evidently been carefully studied, and to 
which no serious exception can be taken. In 
this general account, we do not wish to indulge 
in microscopic criticisms, of which many might 
doubtless be made. We are too glad to wel- 
come the history to be captious regarding mat- 
ters of minor detail. This work is evidently 
one that no gentleman's library should be 
without, and we fancy that even Charles Lamb 
would have excepted it from his general ex- 
communication of such works.

WHAT IS A "BUCKO MATE"? 
( To the Editor of The Dial. ) 

Referring to Mr. Albert Sonnichsen, whose " Deep 
Sea Vagabonds " was noticed in The Dial of June 16, 
page 407, your reviewer says that " the author had the 
wit to avoid American merchantmen and their bullying 
bucko mates." As the word " bucko " is not recognized 
either in the "Century " or the " Oxford " Dictionaries, 
will your reviewer kindly explain exactly what it 
means? Albert Matthews. 

Boston, June 21, 1903. 

[The word " bucko," as applied to the mates of 
American merchant vessels who are distinguished 
for fighting qualities in the handling of their crews, 
is used freely in all recent works dealing realisti- 
cally with deep-sea voyaging, written by American 
authors, Messrs. Paul Eve Stevenson, Morgan Rob- 
ertson, and Frank T. Bullen among them. It is not 
found in any of the standard dictionaries, and a 
conjecture may be risked that it is an adaptation 
of the word "buck," used in the sense of dandy, 
— very much as the word "dandy" is itself used 
colloquially. We have heard it in the mouths of 
Irishmen, — " Ah, me fine bucko," " He's the bucko 
lad for me," etc., — in what seems to be precisely 
this significance The Reviewer.]

SlDK-IilGHTS ON CHARLES LiAMB.* 



Charles Lamb's humor is not exactly of a sort 
to shake the midriff of despair with laughter ; 
it is better than that, — it is gentle, pensive, 
pervasive, sometimes pathetic, and never leaves 
in the reader that feeling of a slight loss of 
self-respect which is apt to follow outbursts of 
more demonstrative merriment. This mirth 
that cheers but not inebriates is not so com- 
mon that we can afford to lose any hitherto 
neglected or unrecognized specimens of it that 
may have made their appearance anonymously 
or pseudonymously in Elia's lifetime. It was 
partly to rescue from the pages of " The 
London Magazine " such unsigned or falsely 
signed productions of the gentle humorist, that 
Mr. Bertram Dobell undertook the compilation 
of his "Sidelights on Charles Lamb." The 
revival of an interest, never really dormant, in 
the inimitable Elia, is attested by the prepar- 
ation now in progress of a new biography and 
of a new and more nearly complete edition of 
his letters; and it is this interest that must 
excuse, if excuse be necessary, a somewhat 
extended notice of a small and unpretentious, 
but scholarly, sympathetic, and entertaining 
volume on Lamb and his circle. 

Though " Elia " was Lamb's recognized 
signature to most of his " London Magazine " 
articles, yet a few of his acknowledged con- 
tributions to that periodical were either anony- 
mous or otherwise signed. By diligent search 
Mr. Dobell seems to have found eleven ad- 
ditional pieces that Lamb may at least be 
strongly suspected of writing. If he did not 
write them, or some of them, he ought to have 
done so. What could be more in the vein of 
the creator of Mrs. Battle than the following 
from " A Hint to Whistplayers "? 

" I can put up with an occasional bad card-hand, as 
Job-like as anyone. A sorry, solitary deuce of trumps, 
now and then, does not put me beside my tenour. I can 
go trumpless even once, twice, or thrice, without an im- 
precation. — I can sort, without pouting, some thirteen 
rabble-cards, and endure, as heroically as Brightelm- 
stone tradesfolk, a temporary privation of king and 

court favour It would be strange if the losses and 

crosses I have suffered in human dealings, had not 
taught me philosophy to endure any reasonable pro- 
portion of Whist adversity. If I can reckon up with- 
out fretting, the niggardly balances that are made out 
to me by my bookseller, — I may surely, without chafing,

tell over a beggarly account of pips. ... To judge 
from our faces, — 'tis a drawn game, — a fourfold dis- 
appointment — but Whist, as the world knows, is in- 
capable of such lame and impotent conclusions. ' Two,' 
■ays Mrs. Battle, the eloquent encomiast of Whist, • two 
are exalted — two again are mortified ' — but it would 
puzzle a disciple of Lavater to say which was which at 
the close of our melancholy rubbers. As far as physi- 
ognomy goes, the winners protest that they would as 
lief have foregone the double points, and the money. 
— They have not achieved success, but had it thrust 
upon them." 

Besides ferreting out, with much critical 
acumen, articles by Lamb, or very much in his 
manner, Mr. Dobell has brought to light many 
pieces, in prose and verse, relating to him. In 
" An Evening with Charles Lamb and Cole- 
ridge," contributed by " S. Y." to "The 
Monthly Repository " soon after Lamb's death, 
a bit of personal description is of especial 
interest. 

"The character of Charles Lamb's person was in 
total contrast to that of Coleridge. His strongly marked, 
deeply lined face, furrowed more by feeling than age, 
like an engraving by Blake, where every line told its 
separate story, or like a finely chiselled head done by 
some master in marble, where every touch of the chisel 
marked some new attribute. Yet withal there was so 
much sweetness and playfulness lurking about the 
corners of the mouth, that it gave to the face the ex- 
traordinary character of flexible granite. His figure 
was small even to spareness. It was as if the soul 
within, in its constant restless activity, had worn the 
body to its smallest possibility of existence. There was 
an equal amount of difference in his conversation from 
that of Coleridge, as there was in his person. It was not 
one uninterrupted flow, but a periodical production of 
sentences, short, telling, full of wit, philosophy, at times 
slightly caustic, though that is too strong a word for 
satire which was of the most good-natured kind. . . . 
The perfect simplicity, absence of all conceit, child-like 
enjoyment of his own wit, and the sweetness and benev- 
olence that played about the rugged face, gave to it 
a charm in no way inferior to the poetical enjoyment 
derived from the more popular conversation of his 
friend." 

Will Lamb's admirers be more shocked or 
amused to learn that he once sat in the stocks ? 
As the malefactor himself scrupled not to make 
"copy " of the experience (see " Delamore's Con- 
fessions " in the third volume of " Blackwood ") 
he evidently wishes us to smile with him at its 
ludicrous features. He protests that his punish- 
ment, which lasted "but for a pair of minutes 
or so," was " for a thing of nought — a fault of 
youth, and warmer blood — a calendary inad- 
vertence I may call it — or rather a temporary 
obliviousness of the day of the week — timing 
my Saturnalia amiss." Mr. E. V. Lucas, au- 
thor of the forthcoming life of Lamb, assures 
Mr. Dobell that the essayist's pseudonymous 
and playful account of this little affair is sub- 



stantially true ; that evidence exists of his hav- 
ing once sat in the stocks ; but that the punish- 
ment was probably as much a jest on the part 
of those ordering it as was the untimely merri- 
ment by which it was provoked. The well-known 
" Reflections in the Pillory " is doubtless a fur- 
ther literary result of this madcap adventure ; 
and thus we have the Bumbles to thank for two 
most characteristic examples of Elian humor. 

A last, and best, quotation shall be from 
" The Monthly Repository," on the character 
of Charles Lamb, as " minuted down from the 
lips of the late S. T. Coleridge." 

" Charles Lamb has more totality and individuality 
of character than any other man I know, or have ever 
known in all my life. In most men we distinguish be- 
tween the different powers of their intellect as one 
being predominant over the other. The genius of 
Wordsworth is greater than his talent, though consider- 
able. The talent of Southey is greater than his genius, 
though respectable; and so on. But in Charles Lamb 
it is altogether one; his genius is talent, and his talent 
is genius, and his heart is as whole and one as his head. 
The wild words that come to him sometimes on religious 
subjects would shock you from the mouth of any other 
man, but from him they seem mere flashes of fireworks. 
If an argument seem to his reason not fully true, he 
bursts out in that odd desecrating way : yet his will, 
the inward man, is, I well know, profoundly religious. 
Watch him, when alone, and you will find him with 
either a Bible, or an old divine, or an old English poet; 
in such is his pleasure." 

The allusion to Lamb's wild words on reli- 
gious subjects recalls his stuttering reply to 
Leigh Hunt's expression of surprise at the pro- 
digality and intensity of Coleridge's utterances 
on religion. " Ne — ne — never mind what Cole- 
ridge says," was Lamb's tranquillizing response ; 
" he's full of fun." 

To correct a very common error of pronunci- 
ation, it may not be amiss to give here once 
more Lamb's phonetic spelling of the mispro- 
nounced word. In a letter to Taylor the pub- 
lisher, having occasion to refer to Elia, he 
perenthetically adds, " Call him Ellia." 

One word of criticism on Mr. Dobell's book. 
Its compilation is a little careless. One page or 
chapter is made to correct or supplement a pre- 
ceding, at the cost of compactness and orderli- 
ness ; and the author (or printer) observes no 
rule in the use of small type, sometimes putting 
quoted extracts in fine print, but oftener not. 
The "sidelights," too, occasionally throw their 
rays somewhat farther outside the circle of 
which Lamb is the centre than might seem de- 
sirable ; but they at least well illustrate the rich- 
ness of unsuspected material lying hid in the 
musty pages of old magazine files.

America's Place in History.* 



More than a passing mention is the just 
desert of a book of less than 300 pages, in 
which Mr. William Justin Mann suggests, 
without taking the time or space necessary to 
develop fully, the position of " America in its 
Relation to the Great Epochs of History." 
The epochs during the short life of our republic 
which the author characterizes as " great " are 
designated by the dates 1492, 1620, 1788, and 
1850, — the first-named being the era of the 
Discovery of America ; the second, that of the 
Settlement of our States ; 1788 standing for 
the era of the establishment of the Nation and 
the preparation of its forms of Constitution ; 
and 1850, not so much in the matter of a date 
as in that of an epoch, representing the trial 
of those constitutional forms by the Civil War 
and the political struggles preceding it. These 
several landmarks in American history are 
shown to be very largely correlated with those 
which point us to the leading and crucial phases 
of modern history in general. It is not alone 
political, but scientific, literary, and commercial 
history which are here illustrated. World- 
movements are those to which the commen- 
tator's attention is directed ; the races of 
mankind are blended into one family ; the 
welfare, the interests, and the progress of all 
are interdependent ; and the growth, the rights, 
the privileges, and the liberties of any one race, 
or of any one political section of humanity, 
cannot but affect and influence the mass. To 
illustrate the part which America has played, 
at each one of the great epochs of her own 
history, in accomplishing results beneficial to 
all other political aggregations in the world, 
and thus to show forth her relative place among 
these other aggregations, is the object of the 
thesis which this author has assigned to him- 
self. What John Fiske soberly postulated as 
the " Manifest Destiny " of the United States, 
Mr. Mann now seeks more particularly to elu- 
cidate, with some specifications. Yet within 
the space he has undertaken to occupy, he has 
necessarily confined himself to a generalization, 
that disappoints the hearty interest which his 
treatment of his thesis awakens.

the United States has found the opportunity 
to discharge its political mission, is recognized

mental operations in all systems which have 
any assurance of success. This proposition is 
advanced by him, time and again, in these 
pages ; yet there is no distinct portion of the 
thesis which seeks to elaborate the proposition. 
Four of the chapters of the small book are 
devoted respectively to the four epochs above 
named, and the fifth and last expounds the 
" Correlations " between the aspects of Amer- 
ican experiences and those of general history, 
during each of those epochs. At least one 
reader would have been pleased, had an addi- 
tional chapter undertaken to trace, throughout 
the entire calendar of these four epochs, the 
office, the usefulness, and the political mission 
of the wonderfully successful principle of Fed- 
eration. 

To deprecate the fashion of pompous glori- 
fication of America by our own people is not 
to belittle or minimize the value of commen- 
taries, such as this one, upon the salient facts 
of our political progress. A sane and studious 
investigation of the facts of our history, a hum- 
ble acknowledgment of their exceeding im- 
portance, and a calm inquiry into their place 
in the greater history of the human race, — 
these are among the simple duties of those 
patriots who properly appreciate the privileges 
of their American citizenship. It is time that 
inquiries such as these should be propounded 
with dignity and examined with sincerity. 
A new understanding of American history is 
promised to the people of this country, and a 
higher appreciation of their political duties 
will follow. The study of our history will 
proceed along new lines in our colleges and 
schools, and will weave its new. fascinations 
around the intellects of their students. Several 
months ago, one of our Western universities 
announced that, in its presentation of the study 
of the history of the United States, it would 
aim " to illustrate the place and office of this 
Republic in the arena of the world's activities, 
and the relation of our history to the world's 
progress." To the key-note thus sounded, this 
small but weighty thesis by Mr. Mann gives a 
clear and distinct response.

A Book of Entertaining Biographies.* 

Mr. James Bryce's " Studies in Contem- 
porary Biography " is one of the books to 
which the much abused adjective "fascinating" 
may properly be applied. Good biography is 
the most entertaining form of good literature, 
its only drawback being sometimes its portent- 
ous length ; and from this defect these sketches 
are of course free. They are, in fact, estimates 
of character which assume or give in barest 
outline the necessary personal information ; 
and their rounded brevity is not their least 
charm. Their greatest charm will be found 
in the penetration, the candor, the sympathy, 
and the literary skill of the writer. Anything 
that Mr. James Bryce may choose to write is 
sure to command the attention of all thought- 
ful Americans — long since won for him by 
his " American Commonwealth "; and these 
" Studies," most of which have been separately 
published in the United States, will only add 
to the admiration felt in America for this at- 
tractive Englishman. 

There are twenty essays in the present 
volume. One of these is an estimate of an 
American by adoption, the late E. L. Godkin ; 
the other nineteen are devoted to eminent 
British and Irish statesmen, ecclesiastics, 
scholars, and men of letters, whose deaths fell 
within the years from 1881 to 1902 inclusive. 
The chronological order of the death-years is 
followed, except in the case of Mr. Gladstone 
(died ls98), for whom the concluding and 
longest paper in the book is reserved ; possibly 
this was done to keep him as far as possible 
from Lord Beaconsfield, the subject of the 
opening sketch. The other statesmen are Sir 
Stafford Northcote (Lord Iddesleigh), Robert 
Lowe (Lord Sherbrooke), Hugh McCalmont 
Cairns (Lord Cairns), and Mr. Parnell. A 
notable omission is John Bright, whose death 
came in 1889; we must conclude that this 
great man did not fall under the category sug- 
gested in the Preface, where Mr. Bryce says : 
"My aim has been rather to analyse the 
character and powers of each of the persons 
described, and, as far as possible, to convey 
the impression which each made in the daily 
converse of life. All of them, except Lord 
Beaconsfield, were personally, and most of 
them intimately, known to me." Dean Stanley, 
Archbishop Tait, Bishop Fraser, and Cardinal

Manning represent the church. Two mighty 
scholars are described in Lord Acton and 
Robertson Smith ; two robust and original W. 
historians in Freeman and J. R. Green. Pro- 
fessors Sidgwick and T. H. Green stand for 
shaping influences at Cambridge and Oxford ; 
and Ernest E. Bowen for a similar power at 
the great public school of Harrow. Anthony 
Trollope, by virtue of his calling as an au- 
thor, was perhaps the most widely known man 
on the list ; probably Bowen and Sir George 
Jessel were least known on this side of the 
water. 

A sufficiently wide range of British worthies ; 
to say that Mr. Bryce has treated them all ad- 
equately would be to claim a knowledge of men 
and events equal to his own. He has written 
of them all with the insight that is born in a 
well-trained mind, fostered by unequalled op- 
portunities of observation, and kept steady by 
a wide and impartial sympathy. We shall not 
look for warmth in his estimate of Disraeli or 
Parnell ; nor fail to note it in his loving tribute 
to his friend Sidgwick. But his criticism is 
kind, though keen; these were great men that 
he describes, and served their generation well; 
and Mr. Bryce is not the man to pick enviously 
at their laurels. 

In delivering his judgments, Mr. Bryce is 
frequently rhetorical after the manner of 
Macaulay, though he does not assume the 
" sovereignty of certainty " which issues proc- 
lamations instead of expressing opinions. 
Himself a profound student and profound 
writer of history, Mr. Bryce might well be ex- 
pected to speak with special authority on the 
work of such men as Edward A. Freeman and 
John Richard Green ; and there will be some 
readers to whom the two short studies of these 
men will more appeal than the more elaborate 
treatment of the careers of Gladstone and 
Disraeli. In determining the place of Green, 
Mr. Bryce classes him primarily, as a historian 
des moeurs, with Herodotus, whom Green nat- 
urally rated above Thucydides. " Great as 
Thucydides is, Herodotus is far greater, or at 
any rate far more precious. His view was 
so much wider," — a deliverance which Mr. 
Bryce pronounces " thoroughly characteristic 
of Green's own view of history"; and he pro- 
ceeds to sum up his merits in a passage which 
is quite in the Macaulay vein, even down to 
the unmistakable reference to Froude (whom 
Macaulay, however, would not have scrupled 
to name).

" He (Green) left behind him no one who combined 
so many of the best gifts. There were among his con- 
temporaries historians more learned and equally in- 
dustrious. There were two or three whose accuracy 
was more scrupulous. But there was no one in whom 
so much knowledge and so wide a range of interests 
were united to such ingenuity, acuteness, and original- 
ity, as well as to such a power of presenting results in 
rich, clear, pictorial language. A master of style may 
be a worthless historian. We have instances. A skilful 
investigator and sound reasoner may be unreadable. 
The conjunction of fine gifts for investigation with fine 
gifts for exposition is a rare conjunction, which cannot 
be prized too highly, for while it advances historical 
science, it brings historical methods, as well as historical 
facts, within the horizon of the ordinary reader." 

Americans will naturally turn with special 
interest to what Mr. Bryce has to say about 
Edwin L. Godkin, the uncompromising editor 
of the " Weekly Day of Judgment," as Charles 
Dudley Warner used to call the New York 
'• Nation," — to which journal Mr. Bryce awards 
the high merit of having been " the best weekly 
not only in America but in the world." Mr. 
Godkin's courage and independence are fully 
recognized ; his undeniable bitterness and oc- 
casional prejudice are not overlooked ; but his 
unique service in establishing a journal which 
did what " The Nation " has done for literature 
and politics is most emphasized in Mr. Bryce's 
closing words : 

" Democracies will always have demagogues ready 
to feed their vanity and stir their passions and exag- 
gerate the feeling of the moment. What they need is 
men who will swim against the stream, will tell them 
their faults, will urge an argument all the more forci- 
bly because it is unwelcome. Such an one was Edwin L. 
Godkin. Since the death of Abraham Lincoln, America 
has been generally more influenced by her writers, 
preachers and thinkers than by her statesmen. In the 
list of those who have during the last forty years influ- 
enced her for good and helped by their pens to make 
her history, a list illustrated by such names as those of 
R. W. Emerson and Phillips Brooks and James Rus- 
sell Lowell, his name will find its place and receive its 
well-earned meed of honor." 

A delightful book ; — and as one lays it 
down, the idle question rises, "What twenty (or 
nineteen) American worthies could we make 
into a corresponding list, of those who have 
passed away in the last score of years ? " Per- 
haps most of us might agree on some such ar- 
ray as this : Grant, Garfield, Blaine, Harrison, 
Reed, and McKinley ; Emerson, Longfellow, 
Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, and Whitman ; 
Brooks, Beecher, and Storrs ; Whitney and 
McCosh ; Dana ; and George Bancroft. But 
where is the American Bryce who " knew them 
all personally, and most of them intimately ? "

Aspects of Philosophic Thought.* 



The late Professor Sidgwick occupied a dis- 
tinctive place among modern thinkers. What 
he perhaps lacked in speculative subtlety, he 
more than atoned for by the singular sanity 
and fairness of his judgment, his admirable 
caution, and the firmness with which he held 
to the broad basal facts of common experience. 
After the pyrotechnic displays that character- 
ize some tendencies of recent thought, it is with 
a sense of relief that one turns to a writer who 
eschews paradox, has always a clear and defi- 
nite meaning to convey and conveys it in words 
that mean just what they say, and back of whose 
utterances one can always feel sure there is a 
weight of judicious and deliberate conviction. 
Professor Sidgwick represents the best tradi- 
tions of Common Sense in philosophy ; and 
this has at least certain advantages in a book 
intended, like his recent one on the Scope and 
Relations of Philosophy, to form a general in- 
troduction to the study. The reader here finds 
himself within the range of familiar concep- 
tions ; he is not perplexed by over- subtleties at 
the start ; and the problems raised come home 
to him as real ones. The book has no adventi- 
tious attractions. It is a piece of solid and 
sober reasoning, with no graces beyond clear- 
ness and straightforwardness, and an occasional 
touch of dry humor which usually hits the mark 
very neatly. For example, the following sen- 
tence : " The differences of philosophical 
schools are so fundamental that it would seem 
to be only by a polite fiction that a philosopher 
of one school allows a philosopher of another 
to possess philosophical knowledge on the sub- 
jects that he treats ; and the politeness that 
consents to this fiction is not universal." But 
one who surrenders himself to the interest of 
the problems with which the book deals, will 
find it both interesting and stimulating. Where 
the interest in philosophy can be presupposed, 
it is perhaps as good an introduction to general 
questions about the scope and relationships of 
philosophy as could be found. As a positive 
contribution, also, to philosophical thought, the 
value of the book is due primarily to the gen-

eral sanity of its judgment, and the refusal to 
allow the demands of partial points of view, or 
of mere logic, to lead to conclusions that will 
not stand the test of an appeal to universal 
human convictions. Most philosophers, prob- 
ably, will not hold that in falling back upon 
common-sense dualism, the author has reached 
a finally satisfactory position. But in view of 
the wide-spread haziness in which the domi- 
nant tendencies have enveloped the relation of 
mind and the outer world, and the persistent 
juggling by which the real separateness be- 
tween them has come to be obscured, it is a 
service to have emphasized the actual position 
of our natural judgment in the matter. The 
book falls into two main parts. The first deals 
with questions about the general nature of 
philosophy, its problems and its delimitations. 
In this one would not expect to find much 
that is essentially new. The lines of distinction 
which it draws are, nevertheless, on the whole 
so simple and natural as at times to be really 
illuminating. Mr. Spencer and his conception 
of philosophy are in view pretty constantly in 
the discussion. The latter half of the book is, 
however, the most original and perhaps the most 
important part. It is a forcible argument against 
the extreme claims for the historical method, 
more especially in the form represented by the 
new dogmatism of the sociologists, where it is 
made all-sufficient, not simply as an account of 
the origin and practical utility of beliefs, but 
as a criterion of their truth as well. In vindi- 
cating the necessity of an independent philo- 
sophical criterion of truth, Professor Sidgwick 
has performed a useful and needed piece of 
work. The enthusiasm for a new point of view 
has been the occasion of a plentiful lack of clear 
thinking, which has stood badly in want of a sober 
criticism such as Professor Sidgwick supplies. 
The general type of result which Professor 
Sidgwick represents is that of the philosophical 
development peculiarly associated with Scot- 
land. In his work on " Scottish Philosophy in 
its National Development," Professor Laurie, 
of the University of Melbourne, has given a 
brief and readable account of the part that 
Scotland has played in the history of philo- 
sophical thought. The book was intended 
originally for the projected series, now aban- 
doned, which was to deal with philosophy in its 
various national developments. The present 
volume is sufficiently catholic in its selection 
of names, ranging from Hume to Lord Mon- 
boddo. There is enough of the personal and 
biographical element to give an atmosphere, 



and the summaries are clear, well proportioned, 
and not too lengthy. The purpose is primarily 
historical, and the book does not, accordingly, 
have the interest of a positive contribution to 
philosophical criticism such as attaches to Pro- 
fessor Seth's lectures on Scottish Philosophy. 
But as a brief historical survey, it satisfies 
essentially all the requirements of any save the 
special student of the period. The distinctively 
national philosophy — that which is associated 
with the name of Reid, and whose exposition 
in connection with its various representatives 
occupies over half the present volume — has in 
recent years suffered a very general eclipse, 
although in our own country at least it was for 
some time the dominant tendency. Probably 
it never will get back more than a tithe of its 
former importance. It is lacking in the finer 
qualities of insight, and only the enthusiasm 
of the historian can prevent much of it now 
from being rather dreary reading. Neverthe- 
less it is quite possible we have not even yet 
learned all its lesson. There are worse things 
than Common Sense; and the philosophy which 
affects to despise it is not wholly free from 
danger. The common-sense philosopher is a 
middle-man, who mediates between the more 
daring theorist, and the natural beliefs of man- 
kind which, after all, it is the business of thought 
to interpret, not to reject. And so long as the 
peculiar dangers of the speculative life exist, 
there will always be a function for him to fulfil. 
In Hegel we have what is commonly re- 
garded as the very opposite of the type of mind 
characteristic of a sober and common-sense 
philosophy, and between the representatives of 
the two temperaments there probably always 
will be war. It may be permitted to confess a 
certain sympathy with the mixture of despair, 
ridicule, and indignation, which is apt to be 
the feeling that results from the attempt on 
the part of at least the less persistent reader 
to get at the meaning of Hegel's enigmatic 
utterances. There really is no sense, in this 
busy world, in making a thing harder than it 
needs to be. Hegel can scarcely be acquitted 
of the charge of going out of his way to say 
obscurely what could perfectly well have been 
made clear and intelligible. As a matter of 
fact, he shows himself quite capable of being 
intelligible when he chooses. He can hardly 
complain, therefore, if sometimes there arises 
in the mind of even a moderately sympathetic 
interpreter a sense of futility and weariness, 
and a question whether after all the game is 
worth the candle. In spite of this, however,

the time has certainly gone by for dismissing 
Hegel contemptuously as a mere charlatan or 
scholastic. That he has a distinct message, and 
that this has vitally influenced the thought of 
his century, it is impossible for the informed 
student to deny. The point of this message 
one may get in other ways than by going to 
Hegel himself. But if he wishes to come into 
more direct contact with the fountain head, and 
has not the time or the inclination to study 
Hegel at first hand, there is perhaps no better 
way than through Professor Hibben's recent 
volume on the Logic of Hegel. It is probably 
quite the clearest exposition for the less ad- 
vanced student that is available, — one might 
almost say, the first clear exposition. In the 
Logic one may find the gist of Hegel's positive 
contribution to modern thought. In so far as 
this stands for a complete philosophy, it has 
indeed aspects which may well be considered 
doubtful. But this does not affect the value 
of the main insight which it represents, an in- 
sight which is by no means so far removed 
from a true empiricism as is popularly sup- 
posed. Professor Hibben makes no attempt 
to complicate the matter by raising questions 
of ultimate criticism. He gives, rather, an 
exposition and commentary, following very 
closely Hegel himself in his more lucid mo- 
ments. The task is done with a high degree 
of success. The book does not pretend to be 
written for scholars, and exception might be 
taken to some of its interpretations. Nor, of 
course, as an elementary exposition, are all the 
parts equally perspicuous. But taking it as a 
whole, the reader ought to be able to get from 
it a good notion of the spirit of Hegel's thought, 
and a possibility of estimating something of its 
value as a tool for attacking the perplexities in- 
volved in any attempt to understand the world.

Letters and Recollections of 
Emerson.* 



Amid scores of studies of Emerson, inter- 
pretative and critical, which this centenary year 
has produced, the two books whose titles appear 
below merit attention by their material and 
workmanship. The letters of Emerson and 
Grimm appeared in " The Atlantic Monthly "

in April last, and are now collated and pub- 
lished in a dainty brochure, that is further en- 
riched by some interesting portraits. This 
more permanent form has an additional ad- 
vantage, for the letters of the German literat- 
teur are here given in the original language as 
well as in translation, and one may thus appre- 
ciate more fully some of the subtle phrases 
which are not perfectly Anglicized. The friend- 
ship which these few letters attest was frank 
and strong in interchange of sentiments as well 
as in philosophic reflections. Though the pages 
are not many, the reader carries from them 
many a vivid impression of the personality of 
the German scholar and not a few rare glimpses 
into unfamiliar phases of Emerson's nature. 
His geniality and sympathy found frequent 
utterance in the letters to the distant philoso- 
pher-historian and his more effusive, gifted wife 
Gisela von Arnim. 

Mr. Holls has written briefly, in the Intro- 
duction, of the circumstances which permitted 
the printing of these letters, — the suggestion 
made to him by Grimm a few days before the 
sudden death of the German author in June, 
1901. To the last he retained his devotion to 
the memory and writings of Emerson, to the 
spiritual tonic therein, — *' but when I read 
his sentences again, the magic breeze seemed 
to touch my heart anew ; the old worked-out 
machinery (Getriebe) of the world seemed to 
be freshened up, as though I had never felt 
such pure air." The correspondence which 
began with a letter from Grimm in April, 1856, 
expressing gratitude for personal inspiration 
from Emerson's essays and humbly proffering 
some of his own essays and poems, was con- 
cluded by a letter from Emerson in December, 
1871. 

Scattered among sentences of deep thought 
and literary insight, called forth by the his- 
torical essays of Grimm, Emerson interspersed 
an occasional word of familiar and affectionate 
regard : — " Come and see our quiet river, and its 
skiffs, our woods and meadows, in this little 
town, whose chief contribution to the public 
good is, that every farmer sends milk and wood 
to Boston." Again, he concludes a long letter 
of appreciative comment upon the writings of 
Grimm and the dramas of his wife, with the 
hearty remembrance, — " Yet it is not books, 
but sense and sympathy, which I wish to offer 
you." Grimm's " Life of Michelangelo " gave 
Emerson special pleasure. In acknowledging 
a copy of it to its author, he well expressed his 
own literary characteristics : " The book has

research, method, and daylight. I hate circular 
sentences, or echoing sentences, where the last 
half cunningly repeats the first half, — but you 
step from stone to stone and advance ever." 

It is a cause of congratulation to American 
readers of to-day that Emerson's centenary 
finds a few of his younger contemporaries still 
active in literary work, and ready to contribute, 
in varied, sincere expressions, their personal 
memories and recognition of Emerson's influ- 
ence upon their own generation. From Colonel 
Higginson, Professor Norton, Mr. Sanborn, 
Mr. Conway, and others, have come graphic in- 
cidents and strong testimony. Among the youth 
who sacrificed much to follow the independent 
and progressive thought of Emerson was the 
Rev. John Albee. Two years ago he pub- 
lished a volume of " Remembrances of Emer- 
son," and this is now reprinted in recognition 
of the theme of the hour. A chance talk with 
Emerson, or a walk by his side, has given 
nucleus for many an elaborated sketch during 
these months of search for some new word or 
impression about his personality. "A Day 
with Emerson," in 1862, affords the author 
material for a chapter of rare interest. The 
happy hours spent in the Emerson home, 
where Thoreau uttered keen and combative 
ideas on college education and literature, and 
" in the evening devoted himself wholly to the 
children and the parching of corn by the open 
fire," are recalled with tender gratitude. In 
addition to the scattered impressions of that 
first visit, Mr. Albee has two chapters of 
reflection and interpretation, — " Emerson's 
Influence on Young Men " and " Emerson as 
Essayist." 

In tracing the unequalled influence of Em- 
erson's lectures and essays upon the youth of 
his own time, Mr. Albee expresses many ac- 
cepted truths with new vigor and personal em- 
phasis. Quoting Emerson's words in a letter 
to Miss Peabody, — "My special parish is 
young men inquiring their way in life," — he 
further pictures the dominant leadership of 
the new master : " I see Emerson at our head, 
leading his extraordinary collection of boys ; 
some overbold and opinionated, others facile 
and docile ; some with long locks, poetic and 
melancholy ; others eager to apply literally and 
at once to all existing evils the Emersonian 
remedies. The master has hard work to keep 
us in order, but he allows a considerable lati- 
tude and idiosincracy, and is overflowing with 
confidence in our future. At last he leads us 



smiling to the seat of the Muses, and introduces 
us as worthy of the palm, the oak, the olive, or 
more humble parsley." The methods of pre- 
paration, the wide range of themes, " the ex- 
cursive mind," the beauties and enigmas of form 
in Emerson's Essays, are studied in outline ; 
and in summary the author has well phrased 
their characteristics : " The Essays contain the 
harvests of Emerson's lifetime ; plain food for 
daily life, rare fruit and dainties for life's holi- 
days. Annie Russell Marble.

i rtand That Madame Waddington's engag- 

dipiomatic ing personality, her intelligent inter- 

drciet. e8 fc m CU rrent events, her exquisite 

tact, her perfect command of three languages, and 
her ever-fresh enthusiasm, contributed materially to 
her distinguished husband's success as a diplomat, is 
evident to the reader of her truly delightful memoirs, 
" Letters of a Diplomat's Wife," recently published 
in handsome form by the Scribners. Americans may 
well be proud to claim her as their fellow-country- 
woman by birth. She is a daughter of the late 
Charles King, president of Columbia College from 
1849 to 1864, a sister of Captain Charles King, and 
a granddaughter of Rufus King, our second minis- 
ter to England under the Constitution. From the 
last-named she appears to have inherited her apti- 
tude for the duties of her high station, and it seems 
the most natural thing in the world that she should 
enjoy something like intimacy with the English royal 
family and be on the best of terms with noble and 
distinguished personages the world over. Her let- 
ters, written to members of her family, are dashed off 
amid the hurry of diplomatic functions, and record 
freshly and vividly the impressions of the moment. 
They thus have a value that no premeditated records 
could possess. They date from 1883 to 1900, and 
give us, among other lesser matters, excellent ac- 
counts of the coronation of Alexander III. at Moscow, 
whither M. Waddington was sent as ambassador- 
extraordinary, and of Queen Victoria's jubilee in 
1887, the writer's husband being then French am- 
bassador to England. The requirements regarding 
costume and ceremony, imposed by her exalted posi- 
tion, Madame Waddington gives in considerable de- 
tail, — a feature that will make her book peculiarly 
interesting to women. The male reader notes with 
approval the writer's occasional superiority to these 
unessentials, and her good-humored indifference when

and one-half hours of standing at the Czar's corona- 
tion makes one very willing to substitute her vividly 
picturesque description for actual attendance at so 
leg-wearying a ceremony. Not the least remarkable 
feature of this noteworthy book is the accomplished 
writer's repeated assertion of her hatred of the pen 
and her preference for viva voce communication. If 
she writes so well, what must her conversation be ! 

The popular cravings for books of 
New England's the H haunts and homes " and "little 

literary haunt*. . „ , . . , . . , 

journeys type seem to be insatiable, 
so much easier and pleasanter is it for most people 
to read about authors and their works than to set 
about mastering the works themselves. The suc- 
cess of Mr. Edwin M. Bacon's " Historic Pilgrim- 
ages in New England " has encouraged him to 
put forth a companion volume, " Literary Pilgrim- 
ages in New England" (Silver, Burdett & Co.), 
wherein our old friend Percy Denison, " grown 
from a handsome lad into a manly youth," is pi- 
loted by the author over much the same ground as 
in the earlier volume, but with a different end in 
view. One is inclined to question whether anything 
is gained by adopting this Rollo-book plan. The 
fictitious Percy is created only for younger readers, 
and they are the very ones to detect the fraud im- 
mediately and to refuse to have anything to do 
with a book that begins as a story and straightway 
turns out to be " improving reading." To them this 
" fine type of the high-bred American youth of to- 
day " will seem an insufferable prig, with his Gargan- 
tuan appetite for literary items. It is, then, we 
think, in spite of, and not because of, the manner 
of presentation adopted, that the genial author suc- 
ceeds in making his matter so interesting. Elimi- 
nate Percy Denison and let the book stand simply 
for what it is, a series of well-informed chats on 
literary New England, and the work would be by 
so much improved. Massachusetts, of course, claims 
the most space ; New Hampshire is represented by 
Portsmouth and the Isles of Shoals ; Portland and 
Brunswick in Maine receive attention ; and the 
Nutmeg State has considerable of interest to offer 
in Hartford and New Haven. The Green Moun- 
tain State and Little Rhody are left out in the cold. 
A map of New England and more than one hundred 
and fifty illustrations, including portraits of varying 
excellence, and a few facsimiles of manuscript, add 
to the book's attractiveness and value. 



The nickname, "Everybody's Bishop," 
BUh^^* be8towed on the lat e Bishop Westcott, 

was fairly descriptive of his warm and 
generous nature, and of his liberal unsectarian atti- 
tude in all matters pertaining to his calling. He is 
perhaps best known to the general reader as the co- 
editor, with Dr. Hort, of the authoritative edition of 
the Greek New Testament. But, brilliant as was his 
scholarship, he expresses a positive distaste for the 
very sort of work he has so admirably performed 
in textual criticism, affording apparently an ex- 



ceptional instance of a man's doing well what he 
heartily dislikes. He was two large a man to find 
refreshment and inspiration in the study of Greek 
enclitics. His work as a writer was devoted chiefly 
to Bible studies, and he made himself recognized as 
an authority on the writings of St. John. Seven 
pages of his biography are filled with the titles of 
his published works. " Build solidly and don't stuff 
up holes with putty," was his advice to his son 
Arthur, who has acted as his biographer ; and most 
faithfully and lovingly has he performed his self- 
imposed task. He wisely leaves his father to tell 
his own story, in large measure, in his letters. 
They convey the impression of an earnest, ener- 
getic, reverent nature. An important service ren- 
dered by Bishop Westcott, outside his proper field 
of work, was his mediation between miners and 
mine-owners, eleven years ago, to settle a strike, — 
a service that he performed to the hearty satisfac- 
tion of both parties. Although the workmen had 
their wages reduced by ten per cent., they cheered 
him until they were hoarse. Among his other ac- 
complishments, Westcott was unusually skilful as a 
draughtsman, as is made evident by a number of 
bis sketches reproduced in the Life. He also made 
his mark as a mathematician (as well as in the 
classics) at Cambridge. He was an all-round scholar 
and a large-souled man, and his life is well worth 
studying. The biography is published in substantial 
two-volume form by the Macmillan Co. 

Under the modest title " A Guide 
A new guide to gj ena » (Torrini, Siena) has been 

to old Siena. . . . v , . _ A . 

published a book on Italian art of 
such importance that it deserves to be brought to 
the attention of all lovers of Medieval and Renais- 
sance painting. The first portion — 150 pages — is 
written by Mr. William Hey wood, well known as an 
authority on the history, the life, and the customs 
of old Siena. His chapters are the result of many 
years of research, and are a marvel of compact in- 
formation, as well as a necessary preparation for 
the second part. This part — practical and artistic 
— is written by Miss Lucy Olcott, a serious art- 
critic in her own right, who has enjoyed through- 
out the preparation of her work the personal aid of 
the best authorities on the subject, Mr. F. Mason 
Perkins and Mr. Bernhard Berenson. The intro- 
ductory essay, on the Architecture, Sculpture, and 
Painting of the city, brings out the charm of this 
comparatively neglected subject; while in the 
practical part, where Miss Olcott takes the readers 
through the streets, or guides them in the churches 
or galleries of Siena, she is as accurate as she is 
suggestive. The uninitiated will not realize the 
amount of special and valuable information this lit- 
tle book contains. In dealing with the works of 
art, it does not retail uncertain legends as facts, 
but gives in attractive form the latest results of 
modern scientific criticism, and this not as an end 
in itself, but as a means toward the greater under- 
standing and appreciation of a charming school of

art. Moreover, the author is certainly the first 
writer of a guide-book to give due prominence to 
the hitherto neglected quattrocento painters and 
sculptors, to Vecchietta, to Francesco di Giorgio, 
and to Neroccio di Landi. Not the least impor- 
tant part of the guide-book is the list of English 
works on Siena, with valuable critical comments on 
each. In a word, this is at once the most accurate 
and best informed guide to Siena, and a serious 
contribution to the history of art. The book is 
well printed, with type so clear and large that it is 
a pleasure to read it. 

Horace Greeley once said of the 
oflAnein biographers of Lincoln, that many 

attempts had been made on the life 
of Abraham Lincoln, that of Booth being a little 
worse than some of the others. He had in mind 
the many persons who came in contact with the 
strong individuality of Lincoln and tried to meas- 
ure it by the usual yardstick. A picturesque and 
unusual character is always a good mark for anec- 
dotes. Lincoln has been selected by William Eleroy 
Curtis, the well-known newspaper writer, as a fit 
subject for that ephemeral phase of composition 
known as "true" biography (Lippincott). The 
volume is an indiscriminate collection of striking 
passages from Herndon, Lamon, Nicolay, Carpen- 
ter, Ben. Perley Poore, and McClure, interspersed 
with reminiscences and anecdotes probably culled 
from newspaper clippings. All the old Lincoln 
stories may be found here, regardless of the num- 
ber of times they have been denied or disproved. 
Douglas still arrives with the thirty-seven cents, and 
Lincoln is still after "bigger game" in the sena- 
torial debates. This newspaper method of writing 
biography does no particular harm except to the 
feelings of Lincoln's ultra admirers. Indeed, it is 
quite readable. But the present volume is marred 
by those inexcusable errors of haste which unfortu- 
nately characterized a previous " true " biography 
from this writer. For instance, to say that the 
compromise on the admission of Missouri forbade 
slavery "north of its northern boundary, 36° 30V 
is to mislead. Even the few lines in the Ordinance 
of 1787 which prohibited slavery in the Territory 
cannot be quoted correctly. Many other things will 
be disputed, where the author turns from story- 
telling to statements. Long since it would seem 
that Americans had abandoned the ground that 
England's proclamation of neutrality in 1861 
"practically recognized the Confederate States as 
an independent government and conceded it the 
privileges of a belligerent power." 

Under the thin disguise of editorship, 
TaZuu^^ Mr - George Gissing has collected, in 

"The Private Papers of Henry 
Ryecroft " (Dutton), musings on life and literature, 
with now and then a chapter on art or philosophy 
or religion. Introspective and retrospective, the 
book may be assumed to give, with some degree of 



faithfulness, glimpses of Mr. Gissing's own struggle 
with untoward conditions and his toilsome ascent 
from obscure hack-writership to successful author- 
ship. A sombre, almost depressing, tone is given 
to his pages by the persistence with which the au- 
thor emphasizes the harsh and repulsive features in 
tliis battle of life. A certain tendency to material- 
ism and selfishness in his philosophy shows the uses 
of adversity to have been to the writer less sweet 
than might have been wished. " I think," he de- 
clares, " it would scarce be an exaggeration to say 
that there is no moral good which has not to be 
paid for in the coin of the realm." And again : 
" It is all very well to talk about doing moral good, 
in practice there is little scope or hope for any- 
thing of that kind in a state of material hardship." 
His strivings and aspirations begin and end with 
himself. " For me," he does not hesitate to admit, 
" it is a virtue to be self-centred ; I am much better 
employed, from every point of view, when I live 
solely for my own satisfaction, than when I begin 
to worry about the world." The semi-fictitious 
character of these confessions is betrayed by an oc- 
casional note that lacks the true ring. Hunger and 
weariness and other ills are dwelt upon with a little 
too much unction, a little too much of the literary 
artist's delight in the cleverness of his workman- 
ship. Who, moreover, after spending half a life- 
time over books, would have eyes strong enough to 
finish reading Walton's life of Hooker by moonlight, 
having begun it under the fading rays of sunset ? 
This, Henry Ryecroft is represented as doing, sitting 
in his garden " amid the evening scent of roses." 
What one likes best in this supposititious recluse is 
his passionate love of literature and learning, his 
almost equal delight in painting and music, and his 
abhorence of the meaningless conventionalities of 
polite society. 

The distinguished Professor of Chi- 
nese at the University of Cambridge, 
Dr. Herbert A. Giles, has prepared 
for publication the series of lectures delivered by him 
at Columbia University last year, and they are now 
presented in a volume of 200 pages with the title 
"China and the Chinese" (Macmillan). The lect- 
ures, six in number, are on the following topics : 
" The Chinese Language," " A Chinese Library," 
" Democratic China," " China and Ancient Greece," 
"Taoism," and "Some Chinese Manners and 
Customs." It will be seen that these lectures do not 
comprise a systematic treatise on the subject-title 
of the book, but are somewhat desultory, although 
their value is by no means impaired by that fact. 
The first two sentences in the book naturally at- 
tract attention, and strikingly depict the massive- 
ness of Chinese civilization : " If the Chinese people 
were to file one by one past a given point, the inter- 
esting procession would never come to an end. Be- 
fore the last man of those living to-day had gone by, 
another and a new generation would have grown up, 
and so on for ever and ever." That first chapter, 



China and 
the Chinese 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



17 



moreover, is a very clear though brief statement of 
the peculiarities of the Chinese language, especially 
the written language. The second chapter gives a 
good bird's-eye view of the immense literature that 
a Chinese " scholar " must master before he is well 
equipped for his career. " Democratic China " is a 
vivid picture of the political and social conditions 
of the empire ; and the last chapter sets forth some 
of the peculiar manners and customs of the people. 
The chapter on " Taoism " is a very careful explan- 
ation of the doctrines of Lao Tzu. Too is a word 
meaning " Way," which appears to be sufficiently 
broad to include a great variety of speculations and 
superstitions. The most suggestive chapter, to some, 
is the one in which the lecturer makes some in- 
teresting comparisons between the civilizations of 
China and Ancient Greece, in which he makes this 
claim : " Those mental gymnastics, of such impor- 
tance in the training of youth, which were once 
claimed exclusively for the languages of Greece and 
Rome, may be performed equally well in the Chinese 

language." 

The microbe plays an important rdle 
of Baeierioioyy. m ^ e ^ e °* civilized nations to-day 
as the servant of man. The part 
that it has always played as man's insidious and 
secret foe is being rapidly exposed, thanks to the 
unceasing labors of many investigators in our own 
and other lands. The pathogenic germ has found 
its place even in the fiction of the day, and its capa- 
bilities in this field are as yet but imperfectly real- 
ized. It is this pathogenic germ with which Mrs. 
Percy Frankland is most concerned in her little 
volume on " Bacteria in Daily Life " (Longmans). 
The author outlines the birth and subsequent growth 
of the science of bacteriology in the Victorian Era, 
and then in the interesting chapters which follow 
she describes the sources of disease and death which 
lurk in the air, water, ice, milk, and other human 
necessities. The book is free from unnecessary 
technicalities, and is well written. It will make a 
valuable non-technical but reliable souree of infor- 
mation for the school and public library, because 
of its relative simplicity and directness. The sup- 
pression of germ diseases, such as typhoid fever 
and tuberculosis, will be much more feasible when 
people are fully aware of the possibilities and dan- 
gers of contagion which science has revealed. Books 
such as this are much needed to make possible the 
growth of social and individual responsibility in 
these matters of public and personal hygiene. 

Tovm-ii/ein The twelve volumes comprising the 

yew England "Memoirs" of John Quincy Adams 

after the Revolution. &TQ made up l argely of his diary . 

These memoirs have been for many years of para- 
mount value for writers and students. J. Q. Adams's 
grandson, Charles Francis Adams, now gives to the 
public an earlier portion of the diary under the cap- 
tion, "Life in a New England Town, 1787-1788 " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.). During these two years, 
young Adams was a law student at Newburyport, 



Massachusetts, following the custom of days when 
law-schools were unknown. The diary for these 
years, portions of which have appeared from time 
to time in the publications of the Massachusetts 
Historical Society, shows an earnest student, an- 
noyed sometimes by his fellow-readers, occasionally 
joining them in revels which leave a flagellating 
headache, and always taking a very serious view of 
young women and of life in general. For instance, 
this young man of twenty found himself opposed to 
the Federal Constitution as framed. " My feelings," 
he wrote, "upon the occasion have not been pas- 
sionate or violent ; and as upon the decision of this 
question I find myself upon the weaker side, I think 
it my duty to submit without murmuring against 
what is not to be helped." At another time, he was 
indignant because the men who participated in the 
Shay's Rebellion were pardoned, while a man who 
stole silverware to the amount of twenty pounds was 
sentenced to death in the same courts. An exhaust- 
ive set of foot-notes explains each proper name. 
The volume is of value to those interested in New 
England genealogy and those seeking local color of 
the early days. Necessarily, political and public life 
is not touched upon to any extent by this young 
law-student. 

Writers on English versification are 
BngfuSLtr*. usually dogmatic, and sure that 

everybody else is hopelessly wrong. 
Indeed, one comparatively recent prosodist admitted 
at the outset that his views would hardly find ac- 
ceptance, and another only last year reprinted his 
magazine articles chiefly because they had fallen 
flat — an unfair infliction upon posterity. Mr. 
T. S. Omond's " Study of Metre " (Grant Richards, 
London), however, appears in book form because 
the essays that compose it have already met with 
approval. Mr. Omond has not been hasty in making 
his book ; he published an article on prosody so long 
ago as 1875. Moreover, he is neither dogmatic nor 
revolutionary. He points out, much more clearly 
than anyone else thus far has done, how hopelessly 
misleading is our use in English of the terms of classic 
prosody. To be sure, when you read "duple rising" 
in the table of contents, it sounds rather strange, but 
after you have read his exposure of " iambic," the 
new term sounds fairly satisfactory. The best of 
the book, fortunately, is constructive. The " period," 
or foot, occupies a definite and regular space of time, 
which may or may not be completely filled by syl- 
lables. In "duple rising" measure, for instance, 
you may have from one to three syllables in each 
period, with indefinite variations of stress, accent, 
and pitch. It is true that this explanation leaves 
the individual to think as he pleases about the rela- 
tive importance of a good many things, and in that 
respect it seems to dodge the issue. The reviewer, 
however, cannot help thinking that Mr. Omond has 
come pretty close to the heart of the matter, and 
that he does not dodge any question of fundamental 
importance.

The Lone-Star 
Commonwealth. 



In the preface to one of the earlier 
volumes of the " American Common- 
wealths " series (Houghton, Mifflin & 
Co.), it was asserted that " the changes of sovereign 
as well as subordinate jurisdiction have been greater 
in Michigan than in any other part of the Ameri- 
can Union." The writer of that volume must have 
been forgetful of Texas, which was under the juris- 
diction successively of France, Spain, and both Im- 
perial and Republican Mexico, before becoming an 
independent Republic, preparatory to its admission 
to the American Union. And while Michigan of- 
fered an opportunity for a history of governments, 
Texas and the exceedingly interesting train of events 
by which Latin institutions therein gave way at last 
to those of Anglo-Saxon origin present the best field 
upon the North American continent for a study of 
a contest of civilizations. It is such a study based 
upon history, rather than the history itself, that Prof. 
George P. Garrison, of the University of Texas, has 
contributed to the above-named series, in his book 
on Texas. For the writing of the book he has had 
peculiar advantages in his access to the archives pre- 
served in the capital of the State, and he has made 
good use of the rich materials at hand. His style 
is crisp and clear, and he has presented the history 
of the Lone-Star State in most readable form. If, 
however, the average Texan is disappointed in 
the author's rather calm treatment of such heroic 
incidents as the slaughter of the Alamo defenders 
and the battle of San Jacinto, and in his neglect of 
biographical details regarding the heroes of Texan 
history, many readers will be grateful to him for the 
sidelights he has thrown upon the whole course of a 
great commonwealth in its relation to the expansion of 
our territory to the Rio Grande and westward to the 

Pacific. 

Mr. Thomas Francis Moran is the 
author of a brief book on the 
" Theory and Practice of the En- 
glish Government " (Longmans). In common with 
many similar publications, the purpose of the work 
is to present in condensed yet attractive form the 
general principles of government rather than exact 
details. The danger of such an attempt lies in its 
very generality, in the impossibility of accurate 
description where exceptions to general rules are 
not noted. Mr. Moran has not escaped this danger, 
and in this respect his book is no better than its 
predecessors. On the other hand he shows himself 
gifted in clear, entertaining statement, and apt in 
historical illustration. His work is very readable, 
and if not regarded as a complete and authoritative 
analysis of English government — and a claim to 
any such merit would probably be denied by the 
author — should meet with general appreciation.

more than a passing fancy. The compiler has done 
his work well, and in his effort to be comprehensive 
has included miscellaneous reviews and even casual 
mention of Beardsley in books and periodicals. We 
note, however, the omission of any reference to the 
review by Mr. Twose entitled " Aubrey Beardsley 
in Perspective," in The Dial of June 16, 1899, and 
the communication called forth by it entitled " A 
Reviewer out of Perspective," which appeared in 
the issue of July 16, 1899. Mr. Gallatin's book is a 
handsome quarto printed on hand-made paper. It 
is illustrated with two portraits of Beardsley, one of 
them a hitherto unpublished drawing by Mr. Will 
Rothenstein. There are also several drawings by 
Beardsley, one of which is also published for the 
first time.

Special Reference to their Bearings upon the Inter- 
ests of Every-day Life," is perhaps more significant 
than the main title, " Psychology and Common Life " 
(Putnam). The series of chapters set forth in a 
somewhat irregular fashion the relations of mind 
and body, the functions of memory and attention in 
health and disease, and culminate in a presentation 
of hypnotism, faith-cures, and the alleged phenom- 
ena of telepathy and clairvoyance. The data are 
accumulated with industry rather than with discre- 
tion ; and the fatal defect of the book is the absence 
of an illuminating and firm critical grasp of the 
status of present-day psychological discussion. The 
book is likely to catch the popular ear, but is as 
likely to mislead as to interest. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A volume of " Discourses on War," selected from 
the writings of William Ellery Charming, has just been 
published for the International Union by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. This is a volume of peace literature in the series 
which already includes the work of Jean de Bloch and 
the orations of Charles Sumner. These works are 
published in substantial form, but at a merely nominal 
price, and are deserving of a very wide circulation. Mr. 
Edwin D. Mead contributes an elaborate and eloquent 
introduction, and the work of Channing which is thus 
prefaced is itself surprisingly applicable to the needs of 
the present day. The peace movement, now so rapidly 
growing, has had no abler exponent than this New En- 
gland divine of the early nineteenth century. 

"Homophonic Conversations in English, German, 
French, and Italian " is a small manual compiled and 
published by Mr. C. B. Waite and Mrs. C. V. Waite. 
The phrases included are such as bear a marked resem- 
blance to one another in all four of the languages, 
which accounts for the " homophonic " of the title. 
The following is an example: " Let me see your assort-

Ainsworth's " Old Saint Paul's " is imported by the

An announcement of especial timeliness and interest,

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. publish in pamph-

"The Novels and Poems of Charles Kingsley " are

found in the introductions to the several works, prepared 
by Mr. Maurice Kingsley, the oldest son of the author. 

In the notice of Professor Sargent's work on " Trees 
and Shrubs," in our last issue (p. 406), an error of 
statement occurred which we are glad to correct. The 
statement that the new work supplements, and, when 
completed, will add two new volumes to, Professor Sar- 
gent's " Silva of North America" is incorrect; for the 
work on "Trees and Shrubs" is quite independent of, 
and only in a general way supplementary to, the earlier 



work. " The Silva of North America " was originally 
planned for twelve volumes, but the discovery of new 
arboreal species during its publication made necessary 
two additional volumes, which, with the Index, were 
published late last Fall. Our notice confused these two 
volumes with the two parts of " Trees and Shrubs " 
now issued. 

An examination of the principles on which Poe con- 
structed his metrical work will be made anew in a vol- 
ume of his critical writings, prepared by Mr. Sherwin 
Cody, to be issued next Fall by Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
& Co. The volume will contain a considerable number 
of Poe's best poems, but the greater part of it will be 
filled with selections from his critical writings, which, 
embodying as they do the principles that governed his 
own poetic compositions, ought to aid greatly in a 
study of his creative work. 

A growing interest in the work and influence of Wil- 
liam Morris is indicated by the recent organization of the 
Morris Society of Chicago, with a general programme 
which provides for the dissemination of Morris's ideas 
by means of publications, a library and museum, and 
workshops and schools of design. The purposes of 
the society are chiefly educational, and relate to the 
social and artistic ideals of Morris. Dr. E. J. James is 
President of the society, and Prof. Oscar L. Triggs its 
Secretary. Persons interested are requested to address 
the latter official, at 5634 Madison Avenue, Chicago. 

Two novelettes of real merit, even though they fall 
a little short of the author 's previous work, appear in

Turquoise Cup " and " The Desert " (Scribner). Each 
serves as a foil for the other, — the former dealing with 
an Italian cardinal, an English nobleman, and a beauti- 
ful Irish girl; while the latter concerns itself with the 
love of a caravan leader in the Sahara and a Bedouin 
maid whom her own father is selling into the most de- 
graded slavery. Both possess the charm of delicate 
material when delicately handled, the atmosphere be- 
ing admirably reproduced and the style clear and bold. 
That both depart a little from the ordinary convention, 
is rather in their favor under Mr. Smith's treatment.

" ' Darrel of the Blessed Isles ' is at once the latest and the 
best of Mr. Bacheller's stories. It is an idyl of love and 
the story of a great happiness that came through a great 
self-sacrifice and expiation. Mr. Bacheller has clothed 
life's simplicities with enduring charm and beauty, and 
made honor and self-sacrifice, truth and love, seem the 
only things that are really worth while." 

GEORGE W. C. LORIMER, D.D. : 

" I have read with great interest and delight Mr. Bacheller's new book, ' Darrel of the Blessed Isles * and I trust 
that it may have as wide a popularity as it deserves. Its pictures are delicate and finished with the touch of an artist, 
its conceptions are unique and fascinating, and its leading characters new to literature.'' Postpaid, $1.50 



HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD: 

" I have read of late few more delightful stories than 
1 Darrel of the Blessed Isles.' Entirely fresh in concep- 
tion and plot, it leaves one with gentle but absorbing in- 
terest and with skilfully managed surprises and incidents. 
There is a sweetness and strength about the whole book 
rarely found in the novels of the day, and in its own genre

A ROMANCE OF THE OLD WEST 

THE 

Lions of the Lord 

By HARRY LEON WILSON, Author of " THE SPENDERS" 

BROOKLYN DAILY EAGLE: 

il ' The Lions of the Lord ' is an immensely impressive story. Without affectation, without strain, without caricature 
it affords a picture of the flight into the wilderness i of the Mormons), and of the men who converted that flight into 
a purposeful and ultimately triumphant conquest, which had not hitherto been equaled."' 



CHICAGO RECORD-HERALD: 

" This is a more serious and impressive work than ' The 
Spenders,' strongly dramatic in its general conception and 
well executed. Joel Rae, the Lute of the Holy Ghost, is 
a distinct and original creation, and all the chief charac- 
ters are alive and clearly limned. The remarkable thing 
about Mr. Wilson's story is that it is written largely from 
the Mormon point of view, while at the same time it is 
a powerful revelation and indictment of the cancerous 
growth in Mormonism.'' 



BOSTON DAILY ADVERTISER: 

" He pictures the caravan of hunted creatures crawling 
over the prairies, toiling up the mountain pass, creeping 
hundreds of miles with courage undaunted by tempest, 
drought, famine, prairie fires, and the forays of Indians. 
They buried their dead and pressed forward to the site 
selected by Brigham, there to suffer until their city stood 
on stable foundation. In this portraiture, true essentially, 
the author's analysis of character is finer than anything 
he has done hitherto." Postpaid, $1.50.

CHATTER ABOUT JANE. 

It is now more than twenty years since the 
death of Carlyle, and nearly as many years 
since Fronde completed his publication of the 
nine volumes of Carlyle biography, autobiog- 
raphy, and correspondence, that resulted from 
the discharge of the trust imposed upon him by 
his dead friend and master. The controversies 
excited by that publication constitute a memor- 
able episode in our literary annals, but one not 
altogether pleasant to remember, and certainly 
not deserving resuscitation, except under the 
plea of the strongest necessity. Unfortunately, 
although no such necessity has been proved to 
exist, the controversy is again upon us in all its 
former acrimony, and " chatter about Jane " 
bids fair to usurp the places hitherto held in 
quasi-literary discussion by the " chatter about 
Harriet " which once loomed up so unpleasantly 
in the foreground when the genius of the great- 
est of English lyric poets came up for discus- 
sion. 

The prime cause of the present offending was 
offered, a few weeks ago, by the publication of 
two volumes of " New Letters and Memorials 
of Jane Welsh Carlyle." For this publication, 
Mr. Alexander Carlyle is responsible; and to 
it Sir James Crichton- Browne has contributed 
an introduction which abuses Fronde with even 
greater virulence than was displayed by the 
bitterest of his antagonists in the early eighties. 
Since Froude is as dead as Carlyle, the case has 
to be conducted by counsel on both sides, and 
the rebuttal in the present instance comes from 
the members of Froude's family, taking the 
shape of the publication of certain manuscript 
matters left by the historian to provide for his 
personal vindication. With great self-restraint, 
Froude kept these matters unprinted, in spite 
of the attacks made upon him during his last 
years ; but his family has now thought it best 
to give them to the world. In a certain sense, 
their interest is petty (except for the patho- 
logical element), but the attack upon Froude 
has all along been characterized by pettiness of 
spirit, and the defense, if any were resorted to, 
must needs be in kind. 



30 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



The underlying animus of the whole attack 
upon Froude has been occasioned by the single 
fact that, in his portraiture of the man whom 
he so loved and honored, he employed the 
methods demanded by Carlyle's own grim 
hero, Oliver Cromwell, and enjoined upon him 
by Carlyle's express behest. In a word, he 
painted the warts as well as the general con- 
tours of the visage. The sleek and decorous 
form of biography made no appeal to him, 
and his artistic conscience revolted from the 
methods of the easy hero-worship that idealizes 
its subjects out of all recognition. Unfortu- 
nately, his scholarly conscience did not keep 
pace with his artistic conscience. As a histo- 
rian, he was deplorably careless, and even 
wanton in his disregard for exactness of state- 
ment and quotation. We do not need to 
instance in support of this proposition the long 
list of inaccuracies in his transcription of the 
Carlyle correspondence and memoirs ; it may 
be proved with equal certainty from almost 
any part of his other work, from his treatment 
of the archives at Simancas or of the letters of 
Erasmus. His defense on this point is inade- 
quate. He says of the Carlyle papers : 

" I copied out the greater part of the ' Reminiscences ' 
myself. A large part of them I copied twice ; I had 
to work at them with a magnifying glass, and in many 
hundred instances I was at a loss to know exactly what 
particular words might be. My own hand is not a good 
one, and there was a further source of error in the 
printer's reading of this." 

We may make some allowance for these condi- 
tions, but they do little to weaken the force of 
the charge that Froude was constitutionally in- 
accurate in his scholarly habit, and that he re- 
sorted to an unjustifiable degree of license in 
all his dealings with documentary material. 

Admitting all this, we still believe that the 
attacks made upon him, both before and since 
his death, by the injudicious partisans of the 
Carlyles, have been unwarrantably unfair and 
brutal. The charge of inaccuracy, which is 
one thing, has been quite unjustifiably per- 
verted into the charges of sensationalism and 
treachery, which are wholly different matters. 
It is proper to protest against the method of 
relentless setting-forth and unsparing exposure 
in biographical writing ; but it is highly im- 
proper, when a man employs that method in 
all sincerity, to accuse him of making a de- 
liberate attempt to pull his subject from the 
pedestal. This accusation, indeed, carries its 
own refutation to those who read Froude's 
frequently expressed admiration for his friend 
and teacher. "Falsehood and concealment," 



he says, " are a great man's worst enemies ; 
such at least is the doctrine about the matter 
which I learnt from Carlyle himself." The 
man whose warfare upon shams was lifelong 
would have been the last to sanction a sham 
account of his own life, and there is abundant 
evidence that Carlyle knew what he was doing 
when he placed his private papers in Froude's 
bauds, to be made use of at his discretion. 
The following words, from the author's state- 
ment now for the first time published, deserve 
to be pondered by those who have been hasty 
in their judgment. 

" My book, if it is still to be condemned at present, 
will be of use hereafter. A hundred years hence, the 
world will better appreciate Carlyle's magnitude. The 
sense of his importance, in my opinion, will increase 
with each generation. The unwillingness to look closely 
into his character will be exchanged for an earnest de- 
sire to know all which can be ascertained about him, 
and what I have written will then have value. It may 
not be completely correct, but it will have made con- 
cealment impossible, and have ensured that the truth 
shall be known. The biographies of the great men of 
the past, the great spiritual teachers especially, with 
whom Carlyle must be ranked, are generally useless. 
They are idle and incredible panegyrics, with features 
drawn without shadows, false, conventional, and worth- 
less." 

It is peculiarly unfortunate that the Carlyle 
controversy should have excited to such exces- 
sive partisanship almost everyone who has 
shared in it. It is amusing, but not altogether 
edifying, to read in Mr. Swinburne's prose of 
" the eminent writer who chose to make his en- 
try into literary life under the self-selected 
name of Devilsdung," and for whom "the com- 
paratively inoffensive designation of Coprostom 
or Cloacinus " is suggested as not unbecoming, 
or in the same author's verse to read of " this 
dead snake," 

" Let worms consume its memory with its tongue, 
The fang that stabbed fair Truth, the lip that stung 
Men's memories uncorroded with its breath." 

But we prefer even this violence of invective to 
the shameful insinuations of Mr. W. S. Lilly, 
who in a recent article suggests that Froude 
wished above all else to make his biography a 
succes de scandale, and that " the practicality 
of Judas covenanting for the thirty pieces of 
silver " offers a fair parallel to the mean mer- 
cenary motives imputed to the biographer. This 
is all very distressing, and yet how typical it is 
of much that has been said and written about 
Froude and Carlyle since the publications that 
precipitated the controversy ! It is obvious 
that neither fairness nor sanity is to be expected 
from the partisans of either camp when they 
indulge in such empty rhetoric. Sir James

Crichton-Browne has sinned heavily in again 
opening the flood-gates of this sort of intem- 
perate talk, and in personally adding to its 
muddy volume. The letters for which he stands 
sponsor have nothing that is essentially new to 
tell us about the Carlyles, and he himself has 
for us nothing more convincing than stale re- 
petitions of the old abusive language for their 
literary executor. It would have been far bet- 
ter to let the whole matter rest where it was 
before. 

As it is, the facts which Froude himself con- 
cealed, or at least obscured, have been brought 
into the light by the printing of his own self- vin- 
dication, hitherto kept from the public. While 
" My Relations with Carlyle " does not perform 
the impossible task of revealing patient and ac- 
curate scholarship beneath the impressionism of 
Froude's literary methods, the pamphlet does 
make it clear that his portrait of Carlyle was, if 
anything, softened in outline rather than made 
unduly harsh. It also makes clear the fact that 
Froude suffered in silence during the last years 
of his life from calumnies that he might have 
refuted by a little plain speaking, but that he 
preferred to bear with dignity rather than re- 
veal certain matters intimately touching the re- 
lations of the Carlyles — matters which, with all 
his hatred of concealment, he had yet thought 
it wise to suppress. The pamphlet also clears 
him completely of the accusation that he was 
in any way actuated by a sordid motive in his 
publication of the manuscript material left by 
Carlyle so unreservedly at his disposal. 

But, although the net result of these new 
publications, on both sides, is to leave Froude's 
reputation in better shape than it was before, 
we cannot but regret their appearance. They 
have reopened the whole question of the ill- 
assorted Cheyne Row menage, and have given a 
renewed opportunity for vulgar persons, curi- 
ous in malicious gossip and petty personalities, 
to roll their tongues over the private affairs of 
the irritable Thomas and the exasperating Jane. 
Twenty years ago we were treated to more than 
enough of moralizing upon these unprofitable 
themes, and now the tongues are all set wag- 
ging again, and " chatter about Jane " is once 
more to the fore in conversation. It is a sad 
business, and the worst of it is that the affair 
seems more likely than ever before to become 
imbedded in the history of English literature, 
although everything essential to that history 
might very well be set down without so much 
as mentioning the fact that Carlyle was 
married.

Nearest to the North Pole.* 

Two quarto volumes, profusely illustrated, 
contain the unabridged account for popular 
reading of the expedition of the Duke of the 
Abruzzi to the Arctic regions, in which Com- 
mander Umberto Cagni of the Italian Royal 
Navy succeeded in attaining a higher latitude 
than any recorded, in company with three com- 
panions, Giuseppe Petigax and Alessio Fenoil- 
let, Alpine guides, and Simone Canepa, an 
Italian mariner. No better summary of the 
expedition can be made than that written by 
the Duke of the Abruzzi to the King of Italy, 
at Hammerfest, Norway, on the return of the 
ship on the 6th June, 1901, reading in trans- 
lation as follows : 

"To His Majesty King Victor Emmanuel III: The 
Polar Star has arrived, and goes on to Tromso and Chris- 
tiania. She passed through British Channel last sum- 
mer, went beyond Cape Fligely in Prince Rudolph 
Island, and came down to pass the winter in Teplitz 
Bay, in 81° 47' N. lat. On September 8th a strong 
pressure of the ice crushed the ship, and caused much 
leakage. Being unable to keep down the water, we 
abandoned the ship. We bnilt a hut on the shore with 
the spars, the sails, and the tents, in which we passed 
the winter very well. At the beginning of the year the 
ends of two fingers of my right hand were obliged to 
be amputated on account of frost-bite. I left the com- 
mand of the sledge expedition to Cagni. It set out on 
February 20th (1901). The intense cold forced it to 
return after two days. It left again, under Cagni, on 
March 11th, and was composed of Querini, Cavalli, the 
engineer of the ship, two Italian sailors, four guides, 
thirteen sledges, and 104 dogs. Three Norwegians 
helped them for the first two days. The first detach- 
ment, composed of Querini, the engineer, and a guide, 
was sent back after twelve days' march, and never re- 
turned to the hut. The second detachment, composed 
of Cavalli, a sailor, and a guide, was sent back after 
twenty days' march, and arrived at the hut in excellent 
health on April 18th. Cagni pushed on to the north 
with two guides and a sailor until April 25th, and 
reached 86° 34' N. lat. A strong drift of the ice and 
the want of food made the return of this detachment 
difficult and laborious. For several weeks it fed on its 
dogs, and reached the hut on June 25th, after passing 
104 days on the ice-pack. Petermann Land and King 
Oscar Land do not exist. The Polar Star was held up 
by the ice and did not sink. A faint hope of saving her 
had made us undertake at the end of autumn whatever 
measures were most necessary to repair her; they were 
continued in July, and after many efforts I succeeded

in floating her on August 6th. We left Teplitz Bay 
on the 16th. We were blocked up by the ice in British 
Channel for fourteen days. We reached Cape Flora 
on August 31st, and Hammerfest to-day. Querini was 
sent back by Cagni while still within sight of Prince 
Rudolph Island. The weather was cold, but fine, dur- 
ing the following days, the ice was in contact with the 
coast, and everything was exceptionally favorable to 
his return. It is with great grief that I must suppose 
that his loss and that of his two men must have been 
caused by some accidental mishap. The steadfast cour- 
age and determination manifested by the leader of the 
sledge expedition and by all who composed it, in spite 
of immense hardships, assured its success, and acquired 
fresh glory for our country, by making its flag wave at 
the highest latitude which has hitherto been reached. 
All present are in excellent health. May your Majesty 
deign to accept the loyal homage of all the members 
of the expedition." 

This succinct report not only summarizes 
the actual deeds of the most successful of all 
polar expeditions, but between its lines may be 
read the sorrows and joys and varied personal 
experiences which humanize such an under- 
taking. Apart from the actual tragedy under- 
lying the total and unaccounted for disappear- 
ance of the three unfortunates of the first 
detachment, the manly surrender, by the Prince 
of the Abruzzi himself, of all his longings to 
lead, when he learned, after repeated trials, 
that his frost-bitten hand incapacitated him for 
the task to which all his energies had for sev- 
eral years been directed, is quite the finest thing 
in the book. Yet it does not appear from any- 
thing he himself writes (and the first volume 
is wholly given up to his personal account of 
*he voyage and journey) that he took this de- 
privation much to heart. Indeed, if it were not 
known that he had shown the utmost possible 
courage, determination, and perseverance, in 
his mountain climbing, especially in his ascent 
of Mount St. Elias in Alaska, it might be pos- 
sible to think unworthily of his staying behind 
when confiding the lives of his subordinates to 
the pitiless rigors of the ice-pack. 

The Prince is free to ascribe much of his 
success to the counsels of Dr. Nansen, who 
manifested in the most practical way his in- 
terest in the undertaking through a series of 
months while the preparations for it were in 
hand. The Prince's own contribution to its 
success, indeed, lies chiefly in his selection of 
guides from the Val d'Aosta, men to whom 
snow and ice, in a form more difficult than the 
ice-pack ever presents, were affairs of daily life. 
The testimony of Commander Umberto Cagni, 
whose personal narrative occupies two-thirds 
of the second volume, to the qualifications of 
his three companions in the attainment of their 



ambition, is unqualified ; and it may be hoped 
that all future explorers in the far North will 
be so fortunate as to provide themselves with 
equally useful and efficient aids to success. 

Though the Pole was not reached, the man- 
ner of carrying on the task prescribed the con- 
ditions for ultimate success. As will be seen 
from the summary, the plan of operations was 
for three several detachments to set forth at 
once, their joint and several tasks being thus 
outlined : 

"The first detachment was to advance from Cape 
Fligely to the 85th parallel, carrying supplies to feed 
the entire expedition during the first stage of its march, 
and for its own food during its return to the ship. The 
second detachment was to go on farther to the north, 
up to the 88th parallel, with provisions for the rest of 
the expedition in its march to the north, and for itself 
when on the way back; and, lastly, the third detach- 
ment was to advance from the 88th parallel to the Pole." 

The circumstances of the expedition of the 
Prince of the Abruzzi, though fortunate in 
some respects, were by no means ideally fitted 
for the achievement of success. It is quite 
within the possibilities that another expedi- 
tion, similar in every respect, might have stood 
upon the spot men call the North Pole. It is 
quite within the possibilities that, even under 
the conditions here, had a fourth detachment 
been practicable to advance the final body 
somewhat farther, the Pole would have been 
attained. In any event, it is doubtful if there 
is anything more to be learned of the Arctic 
zone than has now been disclosed. Barely two 
hundred miles now separate man from this 
hardly profitable spot, the men of the "Polar 
Star " having surpassed those of the " Fram " 
by 20', no more. This being true, it is the 
South Pole which remains to be conquered ; 
and if human energies and the desire for 
adventure are to be exhibited outside of the 
ordinary walks of life at all, who shall say that 
such trials and glories are not better than 
those of war or the subjugations of " inferior " 
peoples ? 

The company was composed of twenty men, 
eleven Italians and nine Norwegians, four from 
each nationality being officers. There was per- 
fect harmony and sacrifice of self for common 
ends on the part of both nationalities, widely 
differing in racial characteristics as they might 
be supposed to be. The exigencies of princely 
and naval etiquette forced the two classes 
to occupy different sleeping apartments and

thing worked out satisfactorily, all hands 
joining in the festival days of both Italy and 
Norway, the differences of faith manifesting 
themselves not at all. It really seems to be 
true that one Gino Gini of Acquapendente, an 
Italian cook picked up in Norway, showed no 
less straightforward courage in the perform- 
ance of his arduous daily tasks in and out of 
health than any member of the ship's company. 
Interest naturally attaches to the diary of 
Commander Cagni, and an extract from his 
diary on April 24, 1901, the day when the 
highest latitude achieved by man was reached, 
is worthy a place here. He writes : 

" We go out into the open air. The thermometer 
indicates -35°; hut, nevertheless, I see, for the first 
time, the guides walking np and down after the soup. 
They are talking of their country! Of their Cour- 
mayeur, where at this moment the meadows appear 
covered with verdure, after their long rest under the 
white mantle of winter. We all remain outside for a 
long time, our minds enchanted by oar great happiness. 
We have reached the end of all our fatigues; our re- 
turn seems to ns now like an excursion, our eyes turn 
no more with eagerness towards the north, but to the 
south, where, beyond so much ice, beyond a cold sea, 
and the rugged mountains of Scandinavia, and farther 
on again, our loved ones are waiting for us. 

"The air is very clear; between the north-east and 
the north-west there stand out distinctly, some sharply 
pointed, others rounded, dark or blue or white, often 
with strange shapes, the innumerable pinnacles of the 
great blocks of ice raised up by the pressure. Farther 
away again, on the bright horizon, in a chain from east 
to west, is a great azure wall, which from afar seems 
unsurmountable. It is our « Terra ultima TkuU ! ' " 

Praise should be awarded to Mr. Le Queux 
for his idiomatic translation and its freedom 
from Latinity. For their selection for this im- 
portant task, as well as for the general excel- 
lence of the book in a mechanical sense, much 
praise must be awarded the publishers.

The Slavery Controversy nr America.* 



The work before us, "Political History of 
Slavery," sees the light seven years after the 
death of its author, the well-known newspaper 
writer, author of "The St. Clair Papers," and 
Manager of the American Associated Press. 
Mr. Smith had been requested by President 
Hayes to act as his literary executor and to 
prepare an account of his life and times. This 

*A Political History of Slavzbt. Being an Ac- 
count of the Slavery Controversy from the Earliest Agitations 
in the Eighteenth Century to the Close of the Reconstruction 
Period in America. By William Henry Smith. With an In- 
troduction by Whitelaw Reid. New York : G. P. Putnam's 
Sons. 



led to extended preliminary studies in the great 
Slavery controversy, and the biography of Mr. 
Hayes was finally postponed to allow the pre- 
paration of these two volumes. They were 
practically ready for the press when their au- 
thor died, leaving the original task unfinished. 
The portion which had been put into form was 
turned over to Mr. Smith's son-in-law, editor 
Charles R. Williams of " The Indianapolis 
News," who has the biography now in course 
of active preparation. As this severed to 
some extent the close connection originally 
intended between the two works, certain por- 
tions of the " History of Slavery," particularly 
those concerning President Hayes, were turned 
over to Mr. Williams for use in the biography. 
The manuscript has also received an addition 
in the form of a chapter on " The Failure of 
Reconstruction," by John J. Halsey, Professor 
of Political Science in Lake Forest University. 
We understand, indeed, that the entire work 
has had the advantage of Professor Halsey 's 
scrutiny and suggestions, though there is not 
the recognition of this fact that one would 
naturally expect. 

In the Introduction, by Mr. Whitelaw 
Reid, the distinguishing feature of the work is 
claimed to be " the relatively smaller impor- 
tance attached by the author to sentimental 
agitations and agitators, and in the greater 
honor awarded to those who instead of bril- 
liantly saying things that alienated support 
soberly did things that compelled it." Nothing 
is easier than to throw stones at the man who 
gives his life to agitation for some neglected 
moral principle. The " foe of compromise " 
can never be a popular man, and as the reform 
for which he works is pretty sure to come, if 
at all, through channels not of his choosing, it 
is a very easy thing to overlook or deny his 
causal relation to its coming. To suppose, 
however, that ordinary political agencies would 
have emancipated and enfranchised the Amer- 
ican negro during the third quarter of the past 
century, or for many generations thereafter, 
without the preceding decades of fiery agitation 
by Garrison and his kind, is to suppose what is 
contrary to human nature and experience. We 
are not sure, therefore, that Mr. Reid might 
not better have said that the most conspicuous 
defect in the work is the author's failure to 
appreciate the relative importance of the early 
Anti-Slavery agitators in building up an ele- 
ment of determined moral opposition to the 
system large enough to compel the attention of 
the masses and force the question into practical

politics, in spite of the efforts of machine poli- 
ticians to keep it out. 

The subject has been worked over too much 
to leave Mr. Smith anything essentially new for 
these volumes. Occasionally we get a letter 
never before in print, — as, for instance, a letter 
from Richard Smith, of the Cincinnati Gazette, 
deploring the second candidacy of Lincoln ; but 
it is always of a class already well known. The 
real value of the work lies in its massing together 
of so large a store of material not otherwise 
readily accessible. The author has not divested 
himself of partisanship, and yet he is open to a 
recognition of the better characteristics of lead- 
ers of the opposition, and to the faults of promi- 
nent Whigs and Republicans. The power of 
Stephen A. Douglas as a debater receives due 
credit, as well as his sturdy and effective loyalty 
to the Union at the outbreak of the war. The 
moral deficiency of Webster's famous seventh 
of March speech is noted, and the incompetence 
and insubordination of Fremont's course in 
Missouri receives some attention. The deserved 
criticism of the War Department under Bu- 
chanan, however, is not followed by a similar 
treatment of the glaring mismanagement and 
dishonesty which was rife in the same depart- 
ment during the early portion of the Civil War 
and compelled the retirement of Simon Cameron 
from the Secretaryship. 

Professor Halsey's chapter on " The Failure 
of Reconstruction " is a renewed exposition of 
the patent fact that the drastic legislation for 
the enforcement of the War Amendments did 
not prove able to secure the ends which its sup- 
porters in Congress and the country had in view. 
He is convinced, and reasonably enough, that 
either the Congressional or the Presidential 
plan put in force without any serious clash be- 
tween the two would have secured much better 
results than were possible in the midst of the 
bitterness engendered during the struggle be- 
tween the President and the Republican major- 
ity in the Senate and House. The great harm 
done by the " carpet-bag " rule which the poli- 
tical disqualifications of the Fourteenth Amend- 
ment and the Reconstruction acts made possible 
is fully recognized, and Hon. Daniel H. Cham- 
berlain's scathing record of this disgraceful 
episode in American history is referred to and 
heartily endorsed. 

In the light of subsequent history, one can- 
not read these volumes without continual cause 
to reflect upon the short-sightedness of our poli- 
tical vision. Our authorities rushed forward to 
annex Texas at the cost of a war, when we now 



know that a little waiting would have seen it 
fall into our lap with no outside opposition. Our 
people were wrought into frenzy over the Mexi- 
can accessions, — the one party in fear, and the 
other in hope, that they might be filled with 
slaves, — when we can now see that the Slavery 
interest was utterly powerless to colonize any 
material part of the territory in question, and 
was destined to remain so, even if Slavery itself 
had not been abolished when it was. Much 
blood, both good and bad, was spilled to decide 
the question whether Kansas should come into 
the Union with a slave or a free constitution, 
though the backward glancing eye can now de- 
tect at once the certainty that the population 
was to be so overwhelmingly free as to be able 
to wipe Slavery out of existence at its will be- 
fore as many years should have elapsed as may 
be counted on one's fingers. What shall be 
done to give us the clear insight, in the midst 
of our political struggles, that we may apply 
our energies to better purpose?

America's Oriental, Diplomacy.* 



" Whenever the American representatives have ap- 
proached the governments of China, Japan, Korea, and 
Siam, it was with the statement that their far-away 
people cherish no scheme of territorial aggrandizement 
in that region of the world, and that their only desire 
was to secure mutual benefit from the establishment 
of trade, and to extend the influence of Christian civ- 
ilization." 

This passage, taken from the last chapter 
of Mr. John W. Foster's recent monograph on 
"American Diplomacy in the Orient," states 
well the proposition which it has been his aim 
to sustain and illustrate in his book. By his 
extended public services as an official of the 
United States government, and his studies in 
its diplomacy, he was well equipped for the 
service of preparing this monograph. It is a 
timely supplement and companion to his his- 
torical sketch of two years since, " A Century 
of American Diplomacy," which was at once 
accorded a high position. Mr. Foster's present 
effort is more than a sketch, — it is a series of 
thirteen sketches on as many different episodes 
of America's experiences in Oriental diplo- 
macy, during the period covered in a more gen- 
eral form by his earlier work. Each sketch 
aids in sustaining the general thesis. 

American diplomacy is now generally recog-

nized as peaceful in its general methods, scope, 
and operations. That it has been such from 
the beginning, has not been so fully under- 
stood. Mr. Foster carefully reminds his readers 
that the Oriental policy of national exclusion, 
which the western powers have had to com- 
bat, was of modern origin, but was in full 
operation when the United States, in 1783, 
assumed a position among the commercial 
nations ; that this young State at once en- 
tered into the campaign for the opening of the 
closed Orient to trade, and in time became a 
leader therein ; and that we have waged peace- 
ful contests for such opening, in strong con- 
trast to the forceful operations of the European 
powers. 

That the ports of the Orient, which had been 
formerly open to free trade, were closed in the 
seventeenth century to the vessels of the western 
nations, was due to the aggressive and often vio- 
lent conduct of their Occidental visitors. Seclu- 
sion became the fixed policy of the leading Ori- 
ental powers, as a measure of self-defense. The 
United States mariners were under this handi- 
cap at the beginning of their eastern voyages. 
It took time to demonstrate that the Yankees 
were neither marauders nor land-grabbers, but 
were simply peaceful traders. When they finally 
achieved this reputation, the progress to the pres- 
ent high position of the United States in Asia- 
tic sentiment was steady and sure. With but 
one exception, the advances made by the Ameri- 
cans toward a sustained commercial intercourse 
in the far East have been eminently pacific. 
The ill-starred attempt of 1871, to inflict sum- 
mary punishment upon Korea for resisting an 
American effort to open trade between the two 
countries, Mr. Foster characterizes " the most 
serious blunder of American diplomacy in the 
Orient." 

The first American vessel entered the port of 
Canton in August, 1784. Our merchants at 
once sought to take advantage of the limited 
facilities for commerce with that one port, al- 
lowed by the Chinese ; in 1789 they began to 
construct vessels expressly for the Canton trade, 
and thereafter they soon began to compete with 
Great Britain, the leading nation in Eastern 
traffic. Fairness, justice and courtesy won for 
the westerners the good opinion of the Chinese 
merchants and some of their neighbors ; so that, 
whereas Great Britain compelled China by force 
of arms to enter into the treaty of 1842, the 
United States secured, in her peaceful treaty of 
1844, advantages not theretofore granted by the 
Chinese to the Occidentals. With equal ease, 



an American treaty of commerce was arranged 
with the Sultan of Borneo in 1850. America 
was thus attaining to a capacity for melting 
away by kindness, in the fulness of time, the 
icy isolation of Japan and Korea. 

Mr. Foster details graphically the successive 
triumphs of the United States, in Perry's open- 
ing of Japan in 1854, and the Harris treaty 
with that empire in 1858, of which he says : 
" The genius of Perry had unbarred the gate 
of the island empire and left it ajar ; but it was 
the skill of Harris which threw it open to the 
commercial enterprise of the world." These 
triumphs were shown also in the subsequent 
transformation of Japan in conscious conform- 
ity to American National ideals; in the just 
popularity of Burlingame's management of the 
interests of the United States in China, and in 
the new treaties and the Burlingame embassy 
to the western powers which followed ; in the 
wise and firm disapproval by America of the 
odious opium traffic ; in Commodore Shufeldt's 
Korean treaty of 1882 ; and in the rapid but 
sure advance of our nation to favor and influ- 
ence in the affairs of Korea. The eminent posi- 
tion which the United States occupied in the 
Chinese imbroglio of 1900, and the opportu- 
nities thus granted to her for guiding the Pow- 
ers toward a fair settlement with the Chinese 
Empire, are thus shown to be the result of a 
gradual evolution, traceable from the date of 
the entry of the western republic into the 
world's politics. 

Mr. Foster makes it clear that these Ameri- 
can successes have been due primarily to two 
causes, — skill and energy in developing mer- 
cantile traffic, and wisdom and discrimination 
in pushing missionary enterprises. The mer- 
chant and the missionary have, hand in hand, 
advanced the United States flag in the far East. 
This author's recognition of the value of the 
work of the American missionaries is hearty 
and unstinted ; and it is the more worthy to be 
noted here, because it comes from the point of 
view, not of the sentimentalist or the philan- 
thropist, but of the historian and the diplomat. 
He gives cordial endorsement to the tribute of 
Minister Denby to the missionaries in China, 
" that their influence is beneficial to the natives ; 
that the arts and sciences and civilization are 
greatly spread by their efforts ; that many use- 
ful Western books are translated by them into 
Chinese ; that they are the leaders in all chari- 
table work ; and that in the interest, therefore, 
of civilization, missionaries ought not only to 
be tolerated, but ought to receive protection."

In the concluding chapter, on " Results of 
the Spanish War," Mr. Foster traces into our 
recent national experiences as a world-power the 
natural effect of the restraint, suavity and dis- 
crimination with which our earlier and smaller 
efforts in Oriental diplomacy were ventured.

Recent American Poetry.* 



The last verses of the late Hugh McCulloch have 
"Written in Florence" for a title, — in Florence, 
"Where even Winter brings a soft caress, 
And all the flowers of art together cling." 

The verses are reflections from a cultivated mind, 
susceptible of the charms of art, nature, and his- 
torical association, and tinged with a not unnatural 
hue of melancholy. They have little of the singing 
quality, and their diction is often merely prosaic, but 
at their best they please, and exhibit a talent that 
now we may only mourn. A poem " To the Medi- 
terranean," seems to us one of the most genuine in 
the collection, and we quote from it a pair of stanzas : 
" All memories which hannt the heart of man 
Cluster on yon like bees about a rose ; 
Upon your shores our history began, — 

Perchance your smile will hover o'er its close. 
Spouse of the sun, beloved of the dawn, 
Sole monument of ages past and gone. 

You yet may lie 'neath mantling Arctic snows. 
" And many a time my soul has shrunk aghast 
(On mornings clouded in September's mist) 
To dream upon your immemorial past ; 
For you alone of earthly things resist 
Th' insidious offices of dusty time. 
To-day you are enthralling and sublime 
As when upon your shore the Immortals kissed." 

Love lyrics and Nature lyrics divide pretty evenly 
between them the contents of "The Book of the 
Rose," which is the latest verse-collection by Mr. 
Charles 6. D. Roberts. Mr. Roberts has undoubtedly 
the lyric gift, as many a preceding publication testi- 
fies, and he now and then achieves a rare degree of 
simple perfection. Such a gem of purest ray serene 
as " The Falling Leaves," for example, might shine

unabashed in the crown of a far greater poet. We 
find nothing of that distinction in the new volume, 
but much that is graceful and musical, which quali- 
ties the following lines shall serve to illustrate : 
" Pipers of the chilly pools 
Pipe the April in. 
Summon all the singing hosts, 
All the wilding kin. 
" Through the cool and teeming damp 
Of the twilight air 
Call till all the April children 
Answer everywhere. 
" From your cold and fluting throats 
Pipe the world awake, 
Pipe the mould to move again, 
Pipe the sod to break. 
" Pipe the mating song of earth 
And the fecund fire, — 
Love and laughter, pang and dream, 
Desire, desire, desire." 
Mr. Bliss Carman is gathering into a series of 
volumes, with " Pipes of Pan " for a collective 
title, his verse of recent years. Some of it has 
been published in periodicals, some in earlier books, 
and some of it is new. The first volume of this 
series is called "From the Book of Myths," and 
contains eight or ten pieces upon such classical sub- 
jects as Marsyas, Daphne, and PhaBdra. One poem, 
"The Tidings to Olaf," stands by itself, for it 
tells how the message of the Christian faith was 
brought to the Norse king. We quote an exquisite 
passage from the poem " At Phaedra's Tomb." 
" Have ye not seen the fog from land 
Blow out to sea, and leave the band 
Of orange marsh and lilac shore 
To brood in Autumn peace once more ? 
"So there survives the magic fame 
Of her imperishable name, — 
Light from a time when love was great, 
And strong hearts had no fear of fate. 
But lived and strove and wrought and died, 
With beauty for their only guide. 
" And yet this temple, raised and wrought 
With prayers and tears, availed her naught, 
The years with it have had their will ; 
Her soft name is a by-word still 
For thwarted spirit, vexed and teased 
By yearnings that cannot be eased, — 
The soul that chafes upon the mesh 
Of tenuous yet galling flesh."

THE DIAL,

Mr. Carman's second volume is called " From 
the Green Book of the Bards," and is frankly a 
volume of nature lyrics, in which the spirits of 
Wordsworth and Emerson seem compounded with 
the mysticism of the latter-day Celts. The poems 
in this book are briefer than those in the other, and 
about three times as numerous. We have been 
particulary impressed with "The Madness of 
Ishtar," for thus does the poet personify the passion 
of Springtime. 

" She will gather the moonlight and starshine, 
And breathe on them with desire, 
And they shall be changed on the moment 
To the marvel of earth's green fire, — 

"The ardour that kindles and blights not, 
Consumes and does not destroy. 
Renewing the world with wonder, 
And the hearts of men with joy. 

" For this is the purpose of Ishtar, 
In her great lone house of the sky 
Beholding the work of her hands 
As it shall be by and by : 

" Out of the passion and splendour, 
Faith, failure, and daring, to bring 
The illumined dream of the spirit 
To perfection in some far spring." 

These may be called wild and whirling words, and 
we are not sure that we know what they are all 
about, bat they have the true singing quality, and 
the essence of poetry is in them. 

Mr. George Cabot Lodge's second volume of 
poems is, if anything, more Swinburnian than his 
first. He imitates with fair success nearly all of Mr. 
Swinburne's metrical schemes, and reproduces the 
sensuous and pagan spirit of Mr. Swinburne's early 
work, with an occasional touch of the austere ideal- 
ism that afterwards so completely replaced it. He 
even ventures to write a " Song of Man," in bold 
imitation of the great poem suggested to the older 
singer by the (Ecumenical Council of 1870. 

" To the gods who are sure and sufficient, who are free and 

more fatal than Fate, 
Who can tally the love of a virgin or the heart of a man in 

his hate, 
Who are wise with a perfect remembrance, who reject not 

a creed nor a crime, 
Who compassionate all, who interpret the ways and the 

wonders of Time ! 

" Who have builded and broken all laws of the Heaven and 
Earth, who are free. 

Who have lifted the seals from the sunrise, made pregnant 
the womb of the sea. 

Who have scattered the phantoms of heaven, wrecked the 
thrones of the world and their spell, 

Who have sown and reaped harvest of flowers in the fire- 
waste deserts of hell ! 

" For my God is the friend that I cherish, and my God is the 

woman I love, 
My God is the Spring on the hillsides, the Sea and the 

marvel thereof, 
My God is the justice of sunlight unhindered by power or 

pelf, 
And vast beyond all and inclusive of all things, my God is 

Myself." 

This is the tacit creed of many a young poet, im- 
patient of the old restraints upon reckless living, 



but it does not often receive so frank an expression. 
Mr. Lodge has a certain mastery of the long-drawn 
anapaest that would challenge our admiration were 
it not so obviously imitative. 

" Let us press in the hidden wet ways of the forest filled full 

of the shadows and sounds of the past, 
Let us travel the fields by the River of Years till the ways 

of the waters are open at last ; 
And our steed shall be staunch tho' he weary and wince at 

the spur, tho' his nostrils are purple with blood, 
For the craving of Soul and the power of Love, for the 

freedom of Faith and the friendship of God ! " 

It is no easy matter to keep this sort of movement 
up for pages at a time, as Mr. Lodge more than 
once does. The following is perhaps the finest verse 
he offers us: 

" Life's choice is this : the world or all the rest," 
but we are more than once made suspicious of his 
' own ethical interpretation of the terms of this choice. 
His " all the rest " seems to be self-indulgence more 
than anything else. Here is where he has studied 
his Swinburne to little profit, and where his fail- 
ure to comprehend the spirit of " The Pilgrims " 
and " Super Flumina Babylonis " is most noticeable. 
••Message and Melody" is Mr. Richard Bur- 
ton's fourth book of verse, and we are inclined to 
think that it is the best of the four. It shows more 
ripeness of experience than the earlier ones, and a 
deepening of the human sympathies. We quote 
" The Reformer," a piece which suggests the grave 
thoughtfulness of Sill. 

" A man once stood before a frowning wall 
Whereon was writ a lie since ancient days. 
And threw his heart's blood by the cupful straight 
Against the legend, so to wipe it ont 
Tapping his veins of all their purple yield 
In his desire. At last he grew so weak 
That, tottering-limbed, he heaved glazed eyes to heaven, 
Sighed like a weary child, smiled once, and fell. 
And when his dust was mingled with the mould 
That giveth birth to flowers, the people woke 
One morn, and looked upon the wall, to see 
A clean erasure of the glozing words 
Had grieved the man so, he that calmly slept. 
Oblivious alike of loves and lies 
That make our human story. 

Then there ran 
A whisper, soon a cry, across the land : 
' God urged him to the act, and he was glad 
To spill his blood and make us clearer-eyed.' 
Whereat the very folk who carelessly 
Passed by that day he drained his throbbing strength 
And paled his flesh, upreared a cenotaph 
And deified his name to after-times." 

We could wish that Mr. Burton had taken his own 
teaching sufficiently to heart to prevent him from 
penning the following apology for imperialism : 

" Yet the earth's stern law is spoken 
In the march of centuries. 
That the weak for good are broken, 
That the strong must rule the seas. 

" We ru iv conquer in all gladness 
If the cause be pure and high ; 
We can bear the passing sadness 
For the blessing by and by." 

These are "glozing words," if ever such were 
spoken, and this " lie writ since ancient days "

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



should not find among its defenders the author of 
so fine and true a poem as the one which we first 
quoted. 

Mr. Clinton Scollard's " Lyrics of the Dawn " is 
a companion volume to " The Lutes of Morn," 
published a year or two ago. Like the earlier 
volume, it is a collection of poems mostly upon 
Oriental themes, the aftermath of a sojourn in the 
East which seems to have left a deep impression 
upon the poet's imagination. Mr. Scollard has a 
touch that frequently suggests the lyrics of Mr. 
Aldrich, and his Eastern pictures have the advan- 
tage of a basis of close observation in place of the 
bookish stimulus upon which the elder poet relied. 
We select " At Ephesus " for our quotation. 
" ' Great is Diana ! ' Ah, the mockery 

It seems to-day, the old Ephesian cry ! 
Beholding what a waste the highways he, 

And how downthrown the mighty temples lie. 

"On shattered columns build the storks their nests; 
Stealthy as fate the slinking jackals prowl : 
Where poured the plaudits at the actors' jests 
In-ghostly irony declaims the owl. 

" The silt of centuries chokes the harborage ; 

And where the pharos beaconed from the height, 
Guide to great galleys, weighed with outland wage, 
Now broods, unchallenged, immemorial night. 

" Nothing the vision rests upon reveals 
ffiifc The temporal grandeur that once here had birth ; 
And, gazing on the desolate scene, one feels 
How mutable are all the things of earth." 

This is a weak enough ending, but the image of 
the owl with his " ghostly irony " redeems the 
poem and makes it noteworthy. " The Count of 
Mirandel," a mediaeval tale too long for repro- 
duction, is one of the most effective pieces in this 
volume, and one of the few that depart from its 
general Eastern subject-matter. 

We are inclined to think that Mr. Madison Cawein 
writes too freely and publishes too frequently for 
the best interests of his reputation, although we 
never take up a new volume from his pen without a 
sense of anticipatory satisfaction. We know what 
it will be about, but we also know that it will have 
much nature-imagery of an exquisite sort, and that 
it will offer us a highly spiritualized conception of 
life. Mr. Cawein's latest volume is called ** A Voice 
on the Wind, and Other Poems." It may be rep- 
resented fairly by " The Dead Day." 

" The West builds high a sepulchre 

Of cloudy granite and of gold, 
Where twilight's priestly hours inter 

The day like some great king of old. 
" A censer, rimmed with silver fire, 

The new moon swings above his tomb ; 
While, organ-stops of God's own choir, 

Star after star throbs in the gloom. 
And night draws near, the sadly sweet — 

A nun whose face is calm and fair — 
And kneeling at the dead day's feet 

Her soul goes up in silent prayer. 

" In prayer, we feel through dewy gleam 
And flowery fragrance, and — above 
All Earth — the ecstasy and dream 
That haunt the mystic heart of love." 



Such poetry as this is not to be discredited merely 
because the author has given us much work of the 
same quality before. And we cannot fail to notice 
in Mr. Cawein's latest volume the slow but sure 
ripening of his art. 

Father Tabb's " Later Lyrics " are delicate verse- 
cameos of the sort to which he has accustomed us. 
Rarely exceeding a dozen lines each, these little 
poems embody simple thoughts and sentiments, 
sometimes merely commonplace, and at others 
touched with such imagination as we find in the 
following example : 

"The world, they tell us, dwindles, 
When matched with other spheres ; 
And yet in all their amplitudes 
No place for human tears. 

" How sterile is the sunshine, 
How masculine the blue, 
That breeds no shadow, nor betrays 
A memory of dew ! " 

Mr. Robert Loveman is like Father Tabb in the 
choice of a form for his poetical expression, and 
the following bit might as readily have been found 
in the one poet as in the other. 

" Old and yet young, the jocund Earth 
Doth speed among the spheres, 
Her children of imperial birth 
Are all the golden years. 

" The happy orb sweeps on 
Led by some vague unrest, 
Some mystic hint of joys unborn 
Springing within her breast." 

Mr. Loveman's little book is called "The Gates 
of Silence, with Interludes of Song." It is made up 
of such pieces as that above quoted, all voicing the 
eternal enigma of being, but relieved every now 
and then by a joyous lyric that forgets problems 
and simply sings. 

" The Morning Road " is a collection of verses 
by Messrs. Thomas Wood Stevens and Alden 
Charles Noble. We understand that the authors 
are also the designers and manufacturers of the 
book, which is produced in a simple but singularly 
attractive form, and in a limited edition. There 
is much thoughtfulness about their metrical work, 
and a delight in the themes that appeal to the cul- 
tivated mind. The imagery is often striking, and 
the diction at times has a touch of distinction. 
Yet the total effect is one of hollowness, of high- 
sounding phrase that a close analysis does not 
justify, of an endeavor to be impressive at the cost 
of clear thinking and verbal restraint. Our mean- 
ing may be illustrated by an excerpt from the 
characteristic poem called " The Sphinx," which 
also illustrates a stanzaic form much affected by 
the authors. 

"The womb of all the world is parched beneath the tropic 
breeze, 
The earth 's a flameless furnace that taints the outer air, — 
Beneath that sand no man may say what cities lie at peace, 
Within that breast no man can guess what brand of soul is 
there ; 
" Hidden behind that stolid brow were spun ;the vast in- 
trigues

THE DIAL

That swayed the arms of Empire to conquest — and to 

death; 
The silent voice that calls and calls across the barren leagues 
Doth hover in that throat that lacks the benison of breath ; 

" Trusting the lips that never ope, the tongue that murmurs 
not, 

Within that heart the phantoms lie of countless empty 
biers, 

Around those feet the wrecks of wills are foundered and 
forgot, 

Across that face the winds have hurled the dust of pow- 
dered years." 

We confess that a feeling of bewilderment is the 
chief impression which we receive from this pre- 
tentious piece, and the others of similar character 
which go with it ; but bewilderment, far from being 
the proper purpose of poetry, is something that 
should be shunned as absolutely fatal to the success 
of the poetic art. 

Mr. Trumbull Stickney's "Dramatic Verses" 
make up another volume which is exceptionally 
praiseworthy from the mechanical point of view, and 
whose contents must be described in terms nearly 
similar to those which we applied to the volume just 
before considered. Yet we will add that there are 
in this work more frequent touches of distinction, 
and that the straining for original effects is more 
fully justified. The opening piece, " Kalypso," 
yields an extract which is illustrative of both the 
author's strength and his weakness. 
" Over his head she stooped. Her odorous hair 
Fell thickly o'er his face. She kissed him 
With all the sleepy honeys of her soul. 
Her arms did slip along his neck, his breast ; 
She kissed him lazily upon the lids 
And languorously on the brow, she kissed him 
Trembling and fiery on the opened mouth. 
And slowly — 

Wind rose. Rustles crept to 's ear, 
Thro' meshes of her hair he saw gray-blown 
The thick tumultuous cloud blotted and streaked 
With witchery of dead moon. The midnight whirred. 
Sparsely the windy stars and feebly hung. 
A little withered leaf blew by ; it scratched 
Him with its frittered edge. For it was autumn. 
Autumn it was. Then did he know. No more 
That year would he return, that year no more ; 
Rather, locked by the vastly circular 
Walls o' the sea, the quashing roof of heaven, 
Still suffocated in the changeless air, 
Still vexed by incessant memory and recall, 
Would stand in pain desirous of that dear 
Fireside and her more dear and beautiful." 

This is about as un-Homeric as anything could well 
be ; yet despite its unpleasant staccato, its surfeit of 
kissings, and its far-fetched epithets, the passage 
has a certain power to grip the imagination and ex- 
cite the nobler emotions. The title of the book is 
not so clearly justified by this poem as by some 
others, notably the story of " Ludovico Martelli," 
which gives us excellent Browning with a differ- 
ence. The volume contains one piece, u Prometheus 
Pyrphoros," which is dramatic in form, and also a 
number of striking sonnets and lyrics. 

Almost any gathering of current verse nowadays 
is sure to include one or more contributions from 
the Pacific coast, and the present review must find 



space for mention of two volumes of far Western 
poetry. Dr. Edward Robeson Taylor is already 
known to many readers, both by his original work 
and by his striking translation of the Bonnets of 
M. de Heredia. His new volume is original, and 
is called " Visions and Other Verse." The chief de- 
fect of Dr. Taylor's work is found in the intrusion 
of an occasional jarring note, such an epithet as 
" immatchle88," or a hopelessly unpoetical phrase 
like " the lightning bug," or a forced license such as 

" He crushed his heart for wine of song 
The sordid souls of men to glad." 

Such things as these are unfortunate, and occur with 
too great frequency. Since the author's favorite 
form is the sonnet, our illustration shall take that 
shape. The sonnet is entitled M Adversity." 

" When glad Fortuna, as a friend to thee, 

Her more than liberal spoils before thee brings, 
Beware the serpent, slyly hid, which stings 
The soul with poison of Prosperity. 

Thou never mayest revealing visions see, 
Nor mount with seraphs on immortal wings, 
Unless within thy deepest being springs 
Some tear-fed fountain of Adversity. 

The steel that Florence drove in Dante's heart 
He fashioned to a lyre, whereon with ease 
He deathless rose above the hells of hate ; 

And when life-wearied Milton sat apart, 
Lonely and blind, he swept those organ keys 
Whose tones from age to age reverberate." 

Such verse as this is of course derivative — in the 
present instance clearly from Goethe and Tenny- 
son — but it is dignified and sincere. 

In Mr. Louis Alexander Robertson's volume, which 
also comes to us from California, " Beyond the Re- 
quiems " is the most ambitious piece, and gives a 
title to the collection. This is also Tennysonian in 
its inspiration, and goes in for cosmic emotion after 
the following fashion : 

" All our knowledge is as nothing ; Reason reels and Science 
sneers, 
Faith below her falling altars lifts her fearless face and 
hears 

"Every cherished creed derided, but still mumbles to her 
beads, 
Dreaming that beyond the requiems deathless life to death 
succeeds. 

" Hope's pale star still smiles above us, distant, indistinct, 
and cold ; 
As the primal moth beheld it do we now its beams behold.' 

Lyrics, sonnets, and occasional verses fill out the 
volume, which is a thin one both as to content and 
to thought. 

The verses outnumber the poems in Mr. Edward 
Sandf ord Martin's volume of M Poems and Verses," 
a disparity which does not prove greatly distressing 
when the verses are as pleasant as those which this 
cheery humorist knows how to write. Here is an 
example, snatched midway from a piece which con- 
trasts the old education with the new : 

" The shade austere of Puritan restraint 

Showed sharper outlines, may be, then and now, 
But not to hurt. For now the old complaint 
Of joys curtailed gives place to wonder how

THE DIAL. 



[July 16, 



'Twixt. stress of sports and pleasant things to do, 
And waxing claims of growing knowledge, too, 
The modern lad gets time to feel the joy 
It was, and still must be, to be a boy." 

A good many of Mr. Martin's pieces are of the 
occasional sort, and display a deftness of touch that 
would not have discredited Dr. Holmes. Even in 
the few instances in which he writes poetry, he 
preserves simplicity of diction, and his bumor is 
lurking somewhere in the near background. 
" To our dim sense God's plan seems often harsh. 
Big fish eats small ; earthquakes and storms destroy.' 

Tennyson phrased it somewhat differently, but the 
matter is the same. Mr. Martin puts his best foot 
(or feet) forward in his titular poem, " The Sea Is 
His," from which we choose these stanzas : 
" Urgent and masterful as here, 

Man dreams and plans, and more and more, 

As ages slip away, Earth shows 

How need by satisfaction grows, 

And more and more its patient face 

Mirrors the driving human race. 
" But he who ploughs the abiding deep 

No furrow leaves, nor stays to reap. 

Unmarred and unadorned, the sea 

Rolls on as irresistibly 

As when, at first, the shaping thought 

Of God its separation wrought. 

" Great nurse of freedom, breeding men 
Who dare, and, baffled, strive again ! 
A rampart round them in their youth, 
A refuge in their straits and ruth, 
And in their seasoned strength, a road 
To carry liberty abroad I " 

Lighter than Mr. Martin's lightest is the vein of 
" Cupid Is King," a volume of rather commonplace 
trifling in verse by Mr. Roy Farrell Greene. The 
following piece has about as much point as any : 

"The second time that Jack proposed, 

'Twas really a surprise, 
Though I still — gossips so supposed — 

Found favor in his eyes. 
His first avowal, months before, 

I'd treated with disdain, 
And laughed at him the while he swore 

He'd try again, again ! 

" The second time that Jack proposed 

I never said a word, 
Though to assent I'd grown disposed — 

I simply overheard 
By accident his earnest plea 

While in the waltz's whirl — 
The second time 'twas not to me, 

But to another girl ! " 

The following piece is fairly representative of the 
volume written by Miss Mary Olcott, and called 
" Poems " without further ceremony. The title is 
"The Unceasing Fight." 

" From the cold North rode out my foe. 
I fought him to the death. And still 
I see him in his mortal throe. 

Urged by his strong, unconquered will 
To fight on with one death-sent blow. 
" Above his grim, white face I made 
The brave sign of the cross. I broke 
His sword, and the two parts I laid 

Upon his neck, like to the yoke 
His soul should feel when sins are weighed. 



" Would God that all mine enemies 

Were stark in death as that one was ! 
But till this life shall fail and cease 
I must fight on. For no man has 
Peace, till the end of life says, Peace ! " 

Miss Olcott's work is earnest and at times finely 
imaginative. We like particularly " Stonehenge " 
and the cycle called " By the Waters of Babylon." 
A quotation from the latter may be given. 

" The light begins to creep, the river flows 
Like a pale streak, while all the rushes lean 

Upon the current, which moves on and on 

Soon shall we march engirdled with our woes, 
Soon reach their God-spurned city all unclean. 
The hour breaks on us, and a trumpeter 
Sounds the known signal for our start and stir: 
How the red dawn strikes fire at Babylon ! " 

In not a few of her pieces the author has caught 
something of the manner of Browning, especially 
the jerky dramatic manner which is a pronounced 
characteristic of the older poet. 

There are many suggestions of Browning in the 
"Poems " of Miss Marie Van Vorst. The dramatic 
Browning is recalled by the group of longer pieces 
with which the volume opens, and Browning the 
love-ly rist by many of the songs that come later on. 
The closing lines of "Three Days More" may be 
quoted in evidence of our statement. 

"Sudden, the spell snaps short to Fate ! 
Till that day — when I see your face — 
There are still three dark days to climb, 
To-day, to-morrow, and its mate." 

A beautiful sonnet, the last of the group of four en- 
titled " Viva ! Anima Carissima," may be taken to 
stand for Miss Van Vorst's achievement at its 
highest reach. 

" When they together saw the Calendar 
Slip by in months that wore Spring all days long, 
He made his lover's verse and roundel song 
The burthen of the rhyme his love of her ! . . . . 
What though the storm swept by with rainy stir, 
And winds, like ghosts, would 'round the windows throng, 
They sat heart-linked, hand-linked ; and bright and strong 
Riot ran through their veins like Mid-summer. 
For palm to palm is exquisite as May ; 
And lip on lip is mad July at best ! 
Where is the fire for this pale Winter's day ? 
For one who sits alone at Death's behest ? 
Ghosts of the storm peer in with charnel mirth 
At ghosts of ashes on the gusty hearth." 

There is a sonnet-ending that has the melancholy 
cadence with whicb Rossetti brought many a similar 
song to its period. The author does not often rise 
to this height of expression, but her work as a whole 
is out of the common, and may be commended to 
all to whom sincere and passionate emotion makes 
an appeal. 

Miss Willa Sibert Cather is a new writer, and 
" April Twilights " is the title of her first book. 
The title has no particular significance, unless it 
suggests the subdued tone of her tranquil musings. 
" Prairie Dawn " is pretty enough to quote. 

" A crimson fire that vanquishes the stars ; 
A pungent odor from the dusty sage ; 
A sudden stirring of the huddled herds ; 
A breaking of the distant table-lands 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

Through purple mists ascending, and the flare 
Of water-ditches silver in the light ; 
A swift, bright lance hurled low across the world ; 
A sudden sickness for the hills of home." 

Of such exquisite description there is much in Miss 
Cather's collection ; there are also engaging reflec- 
tions from the world of books, the history and the 
legend of the ages. 

Last upon our list comes " The Solitary Path," 
by Miss Helen Huntington. Here is a pleasing 
quatrain called " After Nightfall." 

" The sunset sky, with whirl of night and flame, 
Sang Passion's fleeting hour ! came night at length, 
And, black against a cold and moonlit sky, 
The lonely mountains told their tale of Strength." 

A longer and more human example is the poem 
entitled " Barbara." 

" You, for an hour, have been dear. 
And till the end shall be dearest, 
Come mistress or wife to divide your life, 
'Tis I will have crept the nearest. 

" ' Farewell ! ' you may cry, as you go. 

You are keen for the world's great track. 
The shout of the crowd, and the love that's allowed ; 
But your thoughts shall turn back, turn back. 

" And the hour which you swear to forget, 
And the love that was idle breath, 
Shall return in their wrath, and arise in your path, 
And follow you on, to Death." 

Miss Huntington works within very narrow limits, 
but her touch is delicate and effective.

TU New When the first three volumes of " The 

international New International Encyclopaedia " 

Eneyciopadxa. we re sent us by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead, & Co., we took occasion to congratulate 
both publishers and editors upon the execution of 
the work, and upon its special adaptation to the 
needs of those who wish information upon specific 
subjects and do not wish to search for the informa- 
tion through elaborate essays or to be bothered by 
too complicated a system of cross-references. 
Since that first notice, additional instalments of 
the Encyclopaedia have come to us from time to 
time, until at the present writing seven new vol- 
umes are at hand. These volumes, numbering from 
IV. to X. inclusive, carry on the alphabetical series 
of topics from Canada Balsam to Larramendi. This 
last-mentioned entry, by the way, is the name of a 
Spanish Jesuit of the eighteenth century who was 
an authority on the language of the Basques. Run- 
ning through the volumes we note the following 
among the more elaborate articles. Chemistry, 
Chicago, Chinese Empire, Costume, Egypt, Elec- 
tricity and allied topics, England and English Lit- 
erature, Europe, Fortification, France, Germany, 
Great Britain, Heraldry, Horse, India, Italy, 
Japan, and Jews. The illustrations are very nu- 
merous, including many full-page plates, all inter- 



esting and some of marked beauty. We note 
particularly the many brief articles upon living 
men and other timely topics, giving just the infor 
mation we want and often find it very hard to get. 
Our previous opinion of the usefulness, as well as 
the readableness, of this work is more than eon- 
firmed by our examination of the new volumes. 
In its own field, this Encyclopaedia hardly has a 
rival among existing publications. — We note at the 
same time the receipt, from the same publishers, 
of " The International Year-Book " for 1903. This 
work is under the same editorial management (ex- 
cept for Dr. Gilman's collaboration) as the other, 
and is an indispensable adjunct to the labors of the 
editor, the teacher, the clergyman, and the publicist. 
There are half a dozen maps and many plates. A 
cumulative index to the volumes of the five preced- 
ing years is a useful feature of this work. 

?f.5 < £r r '* In his latest book, "The Kaiser's 

cfMMtn Speeches" (Harper) Mr. Wolf von 

hutpeeche*. Schierbrand furnishes an admirable 

supplement to his recent volume on Germany. 
That work devoted several chapters to the Em- 
peror's personality, and discussed the potent in- 
fluence of his leadership upon the development of 
the new Empire. The present one not only con- 
tains the sources upon which those chapters were 
based, but gives a large amount of related matter. 
The material for the greater part of this work is 
found in Elausmann's recent authorized compi- 
lation of the Emperor's speeches — a fact that 
the author fully acknowledges. He has, however, 
added several speeches from other sources, — some, 
possibly, that His Majesty might have preferred to 
have forgotten. When needed, explanatory notes 
are given, and the various addresses or extracts on 
related topics are connected by comment or narra- 
tive, into separate chapters. The chapters are in 
turn grouped under three general divisions, dealing 
respectively with the Emperor's efforts to preserve 
both the domestic and the foreign peace of Germany ; 
with his activity in promoting the welfare of his peo- 
ple ; and, lastly, with his private character and per- 
sonal relations. The translation is Mr. von Schier- 
brand's own. The book is readable and interesting, 
and gives an admirable notion of that many-sided 
activity that distinguishes William II. among modern 
sovereigns. Of particular interest are the chapters 
dealing with his tactful efforts to preserve peace 
and to promote educational reform. The whole 
gives the impression of a character dominated 
by a well-formed and consistently developed pur- 
pose — a view quite at variance with the popular 
estimate of the Kaiser. There are occasional in- 
accuracies in statement, such as the reference to 
Frederick the Great as the Emperor's " great sire." 
More striking is the fact that while the author's 
English is ordinarily excellent, the German idiom 
has often been too strong for him to overcome in 
the passages in which he appears as translator. But 
such criticism is, in a work of this sort, pedantic ;

the book merits cordial commendation. It is wel-

the judgment and fairness shown in his selections 
and for his success in presenting a genuine portrait 
of the Kaiser. 

The essential* A volume which, though unpedantic, 
of musical contains the result of long and labori- 

educaiion. 0U8 gtudy^ an( j seems sufficiently 

learned to flatter those who read it in the belief 
that they are masters of the subject, is " Musical 
Education" (Appleton), by M. Albert Lavignac. 
The work, translated from the French by Miss 
Esther Singleton, is divided into six parts, the first 
of which, touching in a general way upon musical 
education, is devoted to music as a language, an art, 
and a science ; hereditary talent and natural apti- 
tudes ; indications of musical talent in young chil- 
dren, and the proper age to begin the study of music ; 
the proper length of time for daily study, and the 
importance of conducting studies methodically and 
logically. The second part refers in particular to 
the study of instruments — the piano, organ, harp, 
string instruments, wind instruments, etc. ; the dif- 
ficulties of the different instruments, and the quali- 
fications of a teacher for advanced pupils. The 
study of singing, dwelt upon in the third part, is 
very interesting, and gives lucid hints on the exami- 
nation of the natural voice, hygiene of the voice, 
methods of vocalization and period of daily studies, 
the accompaniment, studies necessary for the stage, 
and physical requirements for an opera singer. In 
part four we are told of various studies necessary 
for composers — the study of harmony and counter- 
point, orchestration and instrumentation. " Of the 
means of rectifying a musical education that has 
been ill-directed at the beginning, and how to remedy 
it," is the general title of the fifth part ; and, sub- 
servient to this, the closing chapter dwells upon 
private teaching, class instruction and conservatory 
instruction, with a few remarks on American and 
European conservatories. Those portions of the 
essays devoted to the early education of embryonic 
artists contain opinions which we all might well en- 
tertain. There is not only room, but an actual de- 
mand, for a work which, like the present, aims at 
giving not alone an account of each particular branch 
of musical art, but a condensed summary of modern 
criticism upon it — a summary which is not obscured 
or disfigured by a vicious redundancy of words. In 
short, M. Lavignac's volume is a sort of musical vade- 
mecum, sober in tone and replete with information. 



A sumptuous volume on the "Por- 

juViZaZZr ' traitures of J Qli ™ C»sar," by Mr. 
Frank Jesup Scott, is issued by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. Thirty-seven full- 
page plates and forty-nine inset engravings repre- 
sent to the reader very fairly the alleged likenesses 
of Cesar to be found in the various public museums 
of the present day. We regard it as unfortunate for 



Mr. Scott's discussion of these likenesses that his un- 
bounded admiration for Caesar will allow him to ac- 
cept no representation as adequate which does not 
fill his ideal of the man in every important feature. 
Some will not do because " the suave gentleman, the 
sweet-mannered friend, the philosopher, are not visi- 
ble " in them. The " calm and stately orator," the 
" far-seeing statesman," must always be suggested. 
There can be no good portraiture which does not 
show his " kindly placidity of temper," under which 
must be revealed " a vein of fearless audacity," 
curbed by " calm powers of reasoning." An " im- 
perturbable consciousness of power " is also a sine 
qua non, as well as the evidence of " electric en- 
ergy." Now artists who can understand a really 
great character, and reproduce it, soul, external feat- 
ures, and all, are rare in any age, we are told, and 
there is no evidence that there were any such in the 
age of Julius Csesar. We are thus left free to re- 
ject all portraitures of the Dictator's own time as 
necessarily defective, and to demand as the only 
adequate likeness something which shall display all 
the fine qualities to be detected in any detail of the 
material which has come down to us, plus all the 
noble and heroic traits to be culled out of ancient 
literature, — or, we are tempted to add, to be read 
into it under the influence of a super-heated admira- 
tion. It is to be said, in general, that men do not 
always wear all their good qualities within reach of 
even an artist's eye, and in particular that there is 
good ground for question whether Julius Caesar really 
possessed the almost divine character here attributed 
to him. We may thank Mr. Scott heartily, how- 
ever, for getting this material together, and present- 
ing it in such effective shape. 



" My Kalendar of Country Delights " 

Garden-love m «.• c .1 , 

and garden-lore. ls a compilation, — one of the class 
of books once called Commonplace 
Books, wherein the writer gathered during his 
reading any memorable sentences or chapters or 
thoughts and transcribed them in a book, some- 
times with slight comment or classification. In 
derivative form, and on garden topics, an early and 
charming volume of this class was " The Day-book 
of Bethia Hardacre," published about ten years ago. 
Somewhat varied is Mrs. Milne-Home's more recent 
and more fascinating " Stray Leaves from a Border 
Garden." No volume of which fully half the pages 
are transcribed from the old herbals of Gerarde and 
Parkinson could be dull to any flower-lover ; and 
such is the make-up of this Kalendar. The author 
states that she has culled " from rare books " only. 
In America, these herbals are certainly rare, though 
copies are constantly offered for sale ; but it is a 
large stretch of the signification of a word to term 
Bacon's essay " Of Gardens " rare. We think every 
word of it is quoted somewhere in this " Kalendar," 
sprinkled about on two-score pages. The reader of 
garden-books sighs as he turns the pages of each 
new volume of this class, and encounters therein 
the familiar italics and capitals of Bacon's words,

" God Almighty first Created a Garden, and In- 
deed," and so on ; pages which he has memorized 
unconsciously from their constant thrusting before 
him. Nor is Forbes Watson's " Flowers and Gar- 
dens " rare ; for it has been reprinted recently. 
Much of it is in this " Kalendar." bat its exquisite 
words never stale. It may be added that for the 
author of five books on gardens to write that she 
" does not know the author of the following poem " 
is surprising indeed, when we find that the verse she 
refers to is Mr. T. E. Brown's gem of poesy, " A 
Garden is a lovesome thing, God wot." This she 
gives as a lonesome thing, — a sad error. Her quo- 
tations from the herbals also have some changes, as 
we compare them with original copies of Gerarde's 
" Great Herbal " (1633) and Parkinson's " Paradisi 
in Sole " (1635). But these need not be errors ; 
for there were three editions of each of these great 
volumes, and Mrs. Milman may have copied from 
other editions than ours. A charming feature of 
the book is the list of old English plant-names. 
These are given as original, but like lists may be 
found in Britten's " English Plant Names " and in 
Prior's " Popular Names of British Plants." The 
author states that she herself has learned much that 
is new in preparing this book. This is doubtless 
true ; but we cannot think she teaches her reader 
much that is unfamiliar. Some of the quotations 
and transcripts may seem new to one of narrow 
garden-craft and scant garden-lore ; but to any true 
garden student, the pages in general are familiar. 
They are none the worse, however, for that ; and 
we can enjoy them even if we do not find the quaint 
and pretty novelties of imaginative thought and 
original experience that sparkle alongside the like 
quotations in Mrs. Milne-Home's pages. 

One looks rather askance at a new 
eompanLfu7 hook on " The Solar System," won- 
dering what of novelty or special in- 
terest can be written on a theme so well worn and 
presumably so adequately treated — from a popular 
standpoint — in many recent works on astronomy. 
But Mr. Percival Lowell has presented us with a 
small treatise quite unlike any other on the subject. 
The fact that it has no preface indicates perchance 
the author's opinion that it can speak for itself; 
while the absence of an index suggests the erroneous 
idea that the book belongs to the domain of sum- 
mer fiction. But the title-page rights these specu- 
lations by advising the reader that six lectures to 
the young men of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology have been bound up together for the 
benefit of a larger audience. However, they are 
apparently intended for the comparatively small 
number of those who are students of matters astro- 
nomical, and who can dig the hidden beauties out 
of the mathematical formulae which start out of the 
pages now and then and interrupt the easy flow of 
description. The planet Mercury is treated in a 
novel manner, from the standpoint of the author's 
own observations, which have revealed to him 



markings best explained as " cracks," whose slowly 
changing positions point to the conclusion that the 
planet always keeps the same face to the sun. 
Saturn and his system are discussed with a fresh- 
ness and suggestiveness which will hold the atten- 
tion of even a blase professional astronomer. The 
interesting chapter on " Jupiter and his Comets " 
is mainly devoted to expounding in popular fashion 
the mathematical principles in accordance with 
which Jupiter snares his prey. Mr. Lowell indi- 
cates that the orbits of certain meteoric showers 
and comets point to the probable existence of a 
goodly planet in those far-away spaces which lie 
beyond the path of slow-footed Neptune. The 
final chapter, upon Cosmogony, is a fresh discus- 
sion along lines little exploited in text-books, and 
serves to stimulate rather than to satisfy ; for the 
questions involved are too recondite for our present 
knowledge. The publishers (Houghton) have given 
an attractive dress of red and gold to this little book. 

Dr. R. A. Middeldyk's "History of 
in <a« Wut indie*. Paerto Rico," the third volume of 

"The Expansion of the Republic 
Series" (Appleton), is the first complete history 
of the island of Puerto Rico ever written either in 
Spanish or English. The fact that Friar Inigo 
Abbad's " Historia de la Isla San Juan Bautista," 
written in 1782, published in 1788, and revised in 
1830 to bring it down to the eighteenth century, 
has been for years the accepted work on the subject, 
shows the need of an authentic up-to-date history of 
the island. In the first half of the present book, 
the author gives a sketch of the Spanish occupation. 
With the beginning of this story, — Columbus's 
experiences in America, the wild hunt which the 
Spanish explorers made for gold, the extinction of 
the native Indians, — general readers are more or 
less familiar ; but the rest will be new to most of 
them. Giving only the salient points, the author 
pictures the social and institutional life of the island 
during a period of four hundred years, describes 
the acts of the reigning government, and points out 
the evils of colonial rule. In the second half of the 
work he gives the status of Puerto Rico under 
American control, aiming to present the matter in 
such a way that the reader can form an accurate 
judgment of past and present conditions. The 
writer, who is the Librarian of the Free Public 
Library of San Juan, tells his interesting story in 
an easy, graphic style. Appended to the work is a 
valuable bibliography of Spanish writings on the sub- 
ject of the island. The book has twelve illustrations. 

In "The Real Benedict Arnold" 
(A. S. Barnes & Co.), Mr. Charles 
Burr Todd, not unfavorably known 
through previous works — notably " The True Aaron 
Burr " — as a writer on Revolutionary history, has 
given us an unbiased account of the causes leading 
up to Arnold's desertion of his country. While the 
author does not in any sense attempt to lessen the 
enormity of Arnold's crime, he emphasizes his sub-

ject's invaluable services to America, and points out 
that he four times saved the cause of the Colonies : 
first, at the battle of Valcour's Island on Lake Cham- 
plain (the first naval battle in which our arms were 
engaged) ; second, by raising the siege of Fort Stan- 
wix in the Mohawk Valley and putting to flight St. 
Leger's invading army marching to aid Burgoyne ; 
and, third and fourth, by winning the two battles at 
Saratoga, which, conjoined, Cressy included as one 
of the fifteen decisive battles of the world. Arnold's 
wife was the beautiful " Peggy " Shippen, of Phila- 
delphia, a member of one of the most influential 
families of the Quaker City, who had been a general 
favorite with the British officers before she met 
Arnold, and particularly with the fascinating John 
Andre. In deciding her choice for a husband, she 
saw in the military governor of the city and the 
major-general of the army great opportunities for 
social advancement and leadership. Correspondence 
with Andre and other British officers was carried on 
after her marriage ; and Mr. Todd maintains that 
it was the influence of Arnold's wife, with whom he 
was madly infatuated, and his fear of losing her 
should her treasonable correspondence with his coun- 
try's enemies be discovered, that induced Arnold to 
betray his country, and not the gross injustice of 
Congress nor the calumnies of paper generals — the 
motives generally ascribed. An especially note- 
worthy illustration of the book is the reproduction 
of an old print representing the burning of Arnold 
in effigy. 

To the growing list of books describ- 
ing the steps by which our national 
territory has increased since colonial 
times, is added a volume entitled " The American 
Advance," by Mr. Edmund J. Carpenter. The book 
f ollow8 the conventional plan for such works, a sepa- 
rate chapter of from fifteen to sixty pages being 
given to each of the nine large additions to our do- 
main. Each chapter contains a careful chronological 
account of the negotiations and other steps that led 
to the acquisition of the territory under considera- 
tion, without partisan bias or undue national glori- 
fication. The book is devoted for the most part to 
the older territorial expansion, — Cuba, Puerto Rico, 
Guam, and the Philippines together having but a 
brief chapter of fifteen pages. There are no foot- 
notes, and the book is intended for the general reader.

The Turk ^ r# William Eleroy Curtis has given 

and hi* us an interesting book about the 

lost province*. Eastern Question, in a series of pen 
pictures, which are really a record of personal ob- 
servations concerning conditions in Constantinople 
and the Balkan States on the occasion of a trip which 
Mr. Curtis made to the East, in 1901, as a news- 
paper correspondent. The letters which he then 
wrote have now been collected and brought out in 
book form under the title of " The Turk and his Lost 
Provinces " (F. H. Revell Co.) Rivalry and jealousy

make and keep the Eastern Question an open one. 
Each nation, fearing that some other one will get 
more than its share of influence or political privileges, 
stands idly by and disregards human suffering oc- 
casioned by Turkish atrocities committed with im- 
punity in " the Buffer States." War is pending, 
and must come ; the Turk must go. The day is not 
far distant when the Czar of Russia will occupy the 
Sultan's throne. Mr. Curtis's work, done in light, 
easy, sketchy style, with not much of an attempt at 
literary finish, deals quite fully and interestingly with 
these and other phases of a very important subject. 



A treatise on 
Trust* and 
Combinations. 



" Trust Finance : A Study of the 
Genesis, Organization, and Manage- 
ment of Industrial Combinations" 
(Appleton), by Dr. Edward Sherwood Meade, of 
the Wharton School of Finance and Economy, is an 
exceedingly sane and luminous discussion of a timely 
topic by one who is familiar with his subject. There 
are so many crude and erroneous notions extant with 
reference to trusts and combinations, that it is de- 
cidedly refreshing to examine a volume which treats 
of these matters in a dispassionate, intelligent and 
scholarly manner. The author says that the trust 
movement began in 1893, following the industrial 
depression of that year. The industrial revival 
gathered strength in 1898, and caused a general de- 
mand for the stocks of good paying corporations. 
Prof essor Meade's work is divided into twenty chap- 
ters, which discuss competition, the function and 
office of the promoter in modern industry, the dis- 
posal of the stock of the trust, accumulation of sur- 
plus, provision of new capital, bond issue, funding 
policy, capitalization of corporations, decline of in- 
dustrial shares, investment possibilities, and sugges- 
tions for national legislation on corporation finance. 
This book supplies a demand not heretofore filled, 
and will command the interest of the practical man 
of affairs.

" A Geography of Commerce," by Messrs. John N. 
Tilden and Albert Clarke, is published by Messrs. B. H. 
Sanborn & Co. 

The works of Thomas Campion, including his songs 
and masques, and the " Observations in the Art of En- 
glish Poesy," have again been edited by Mr. A. H. 
Bullen, this time in a volume of " The Muses' Library," 
of which the Messrs. Scribner are the American pub- 
lishers. 

" A General History of Commerce," by Mr. William 
Clarence Webster, is a recent educational publication 
of Messrs. Ginn & Co., and will do useful work in sup- 
plying the growing demand for modern text-books in 
the commercial courses that our high-schools are set- 
ting up so generally. 

A " Guide to Switzerland " is added to the series of 
travellers' manuals published by the Macmillan Co. The 
maps are numerous and particularly good, while the 
text is both compact and up-to-date. No other guide- 
book can be quite as good as a Baedeker, but the one 
before us has many commendable features. 

" Ephemeral Bibelots " appears on the title-page, and 
" Modern Chap- Books and their Imitators " upon the 
cover, of a pamphlet by Mr. Frederick Winthrop Faxon, 
sent us by the Boston Book Co. In substance, this little 
work is a bibliography of the freakish toy periodicals 
that have sprung up in such numbers during the past ten 
years. But how does an ex-Secretary of the American 
Library Association reconcile with his conscience this 
provision of alternative titles? 

Volume Till, of the " Studies and Notes in Philology 
and Literature," published for Harvard University by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co., is given up to two extensive mono- 
graphs in the Arthurian field. Mr. Arthur C. L. Brown 
is the author of " Iwain : A Study in the Origins of 
Arthurian Romance," which comes first in the volume, 
and this work is followed by " Arthur and Gorlagon," 
a new text, edited with mucb apparatus chiefly relating 
to werewolves by Professor George L. Kittredge. 

The Division of Bibliography of the Library of Con- 
gress is engaged in the very useful work of publishing 
special lists of book and periodical references upon 
timely topics. A batch of these bibliographies just sent 
out includes the following subjects: labor and strikes, 
old age and civil-service pensions, industrial arbitration, 
government ownership of railroads, the Constitution of 
the United States, federal control of commerce and 
corporations, Anglo-Saxon interests, the negro question, 
cabinets of England and America, and a second edition 
of the bibliography of mercantile marine subsidies. Mr. 
A. P. C. Griffin is the division chief under whose direc- 
tion these lists are prepared. 

" The Espurgatoire Saint Patriz of Marie de France," 
by Professor T. Atkinson Jenkins, is a decennial publi- 
cation of the University of Chicago. Nearly ten years 
ago we mentioned an edition of the same work by the 
same editor, but since that publication the author has 
had access to important material which he did not then 
use. The present edition gives us in parallel columns 
both the French text and the Latin of the " Tractatus 
de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii " of Henricus Salteriensis, 
which was the original from which Marie de France 
worked. This edition is thus made much more com- 
plete and valuable than its predecessor, and constitutes 
a highly creditable addition to the series of learned 
publications in which it is included. 



"On the Literary Theories of Taine and Herbert 
Spencer " is the title of a pamphlet published by Mr. 
David Nutt, and containing two lectures by Professor 
A. T. W. Borsdorf. The tendency of the author's crit- 
icism is destructive, as he aims only to help clear the 
way for the constructive work of the future. 

An unusually attractive guide-book to the city of 
Boston, prepared by Mr. Edwin M. Bacon, is issued by 
Messrs. Ginn & Co. Original and authentic material, 
numerous maps in color and in diagram, handy indexes 
and running-titles, and good mechanical execution, help 
to make this one of the best city guides we know. 

A committee of the Franklin and Marshall College, 
of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has prepared a " Catalogue 
of Officers and Students " of that institution from the 
date of its founding in 1787 to the present time. An 
" Obituary Record " for recent years is also published. 
These two works are pamphlets, but they are accom- 
panied by a substantial bound volume of four hundred 
pages, giving a ■ History of Franklin and Marshall 
College " in ample detail. This is the work of Professor 
Joseph Henry Dubbs, and is handsomely illustrated. 
The earlier chapters of this book, as may easily be under- 
stood, throw many interesting sidelights upon the be- 
ginning of the national period of American history. 

The latest batch of the University of Chicago decen- 
nial publications includes a noteworthy examination, by 
Professor Oliver Joseph Thatcher, of the questions con- 
nected with the papal grant of Ireland to Henry II. 
"Studies Concerning Adrian IT." is the title of this 
monograph, and the author accepts the view that the 
Bull Latidabiliter is a rhetorical exercise of no historical 
value. Other publications in this series are " Scientific 
Method in Education," by Mrs. Ella Flagg Young; 
"Practical Theology," by Mr. Gerald Birney Smith; 
" The Elements of Chrysostom's Power as a Preacher," 
by Professor Galusha Anderson ; « Have We the Like- 
ness of Christ ? " by Professor Franklin Johnson ; " The 
Self-Purification of Streams," by Professor Edwin O. 
Jordan; "Some Paradoxes of the English Romantic 
Movement," by Professor William Darnell MacClin- 
tock ; and " A Stichometric Scholium to the Medea of 
Euripides," by Mr. Tenny Frank. 

William Ernest Henley, who died on the 12th of 
this month, at the age of fifty-four, was distinguished as 
poet, critic, and editor, while his strongly-marked and 
aggressive personality gave him an inspiring influence 
upon many of the younger men with whom he was 
associated. While editor of "The Scots Observer," he 
almost founded a school of writers, so strongly did he 
impose himself upon the aspiring talents that found 
expression in that brilliant journal. He also edited, at 
different times, " London," " The Magazine of Art," and 
" The New Review." He was one of Stevenson's most 
intimate friends, and the two men wrote several plays 
in collaboration. His editions of Burns and Byron were 
enriched with much vigorous and characteristic com- 
mentary of the sort that often arouses violent antag- 
onisms. His place as a poet is high among the minor 
singers of the last half-century, and there are few 
lovers of poetry who do not have associations with his 
"Hospital Rhymes," his "London Toluntaries," and 
his " Hawthorne and Lavender." His verse is hot and 
full-blooded, caring little for nicety of expression, and 
in general exhibitive of far more energy than art. At 
any rate, there is little that is imitative about his work, 
and his originality is as unquestionable as his strength.

BOOKS OF INTEREST AND UTILITY 

Edited by SHERWIN CODY 

A Selection from 

THE BEST ENGLISH ESSAYS 

Illustrative of the History of English Prose Style. With Historical and Critical Introduction by the Editor. 
The student of English prose style, whether he wishes to write prose himself, or to learn its elements, 
that he may judge the style of current writers, will find this a most suggestive and enlightening book. The 
general introduction defines and analyzes the essential elements of artistic prose, and the introductions to the 
different essayists point out the really important characteristic of each style. The selection, too, is fortunate 
in giving examples of ten great styles, all different and individual, which the student of English is invited to 
study and imitate. 

" By reading such a book, with its intelligent historical and critical comments, it is possible for the average reader to get an 
idea of the English essay that cannot be secured elsewhere." — Indianapolis Sentinel. 

" His choice, both of writers and their works, may be heartily commended." — 'Boston Transcript. 

" He has written for the book a preface that is a gem." — The Argonaut. 

A Selection from 

THE WORLD'S GREATEST SHORT STORIES 

Illustrative of the History of Short Story Writing. With Critical and Historical Comments by the Editor. 

Since its publication Mr. Cody's book has been adopted by twelve large universities, and a score of 
smaller institutions, which is a demonstration of its practical worth. Nothing just like it has ever been 
available, and students of literature have been quick to recognize this fact. This volume is far more than a 
collection of short tales that may as conveniently be read elsewhere, as the series of fourteen introductions to 
the various stories constitute the only comprehensive history of short story writing as an art ever published. 

In form and shape these books are especially convenient, being printed on thin Bible paper, so that in 
spite of their extensive contents they are scarcely three-quarters of an inch thick. 

18mo. Price, $1.00 net; delivered, $1.06. 



IN PREPARATION 

THE BEST TALES OF EDGAR ALLAN POE 
THE BEST POEMS AND ESSAYS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE 

The publishers believe that these two volumes, especially the second one, offer the most original and 
striking study of Poe's art and personality ever printed. Even old students of Poe will be surprised to find 
in the new arrangement of Poe's criticism a detailed analysis of the general principles of novel-writing, and 
short-story writing, as well as the better known essays on poetry and examples of criticism of poetry, with his 
many pithy remarks on life and literature gathered from his journalistic book reviews. 

The books will be of the same handy form and size as the " Short Stories " and " Best Essays."

"A BOOK TO BE READ, AND THEN READ A SECOND 
TIME, ALIKE FOR ITS BEAUTY AND ITS THOUGHT/' 

Mr. JAMES LANE ALLEN'S New Novel 

The Mettle of the Pasture 



THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT says:— 

■ It may be that ' The Mettle of the 
Pasture ' will live and become a part of 
our literature ; it certainly will live far be- 
yond the alloted term of present-day fiction. 
Our principal concern is that it is a notable 
novel, that it ranks high in the entire range 
of American and English fiction, and that 
it is worth the reading, the re-reading, and 
the continuous appreciation of those who 
care for modern literature at its best. 

-E. F. E." 



THE BROOKLYN EAGLE says:— 

"In ♦The Mettle of the Pasture' 

Mr. Allen has reached the high-water 
mark thus far of his genius as a novelist. 
The beauty of his literary style, the pic- 
turesque quality of his description, the 
vitality, fullness and strength of his 
artistic powers never showed to better 
advantage. . . . Its reader is fasci- 
nated by the picturesque descriptions, the 
humor, the clear insight, and the absolute 
interest of his creations."

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

L 



Following our custom of many years, we pub- 
lish, in this and another issue of The Dial, a 
summary of the reports contributed to "The 
Athenaeum " by various writers, upon the liter- 
ary production of the last twelvemonth in the 
principal European countries. The reports sum- 
marized in the present article are from Belgium, 
by Professor Paul Fredericq, from Bohemia, 
by Dr. V. Tille, from Denmark by Dr. Alfred 
Ipsen, from France, by M. Jules Pravieux, and 
from Germany, by Dr. Ernst Heilborn. 

Professor Fredericq gives us little more than 
a catalogue of the year's production in Belgium. 
M. Maeterlinck comes first, but his new dram- 
atic piece, " Joyzelle," has not been as success- 
ful as the "Monna Vanna " of last year. Other 
plays are "Jericho " and " Fatigue de Vivre," 
by M. Edmond Picard, "L'Imposteur Mag- 
nanime, Perkin Warbeck," by M. Eekhoud; 
and " Les Orties," by M. Sander Pierron. 
The poets are represented by M. Verhaeren's 
" Les Forces Tumultueuses," and M. Gille's 
"La Corbeille d'Octobre." The best novels 
are "Le Petit Homme de Dieu," by M. Camille 
Lemonnier ; and "Les Noces d'Or de Monsieur 
et de Madame Van Poppel," which latter book 
completes the series devoted to the Kakebroek 
family, a Brussels counterpart of Herr Stinde's 
Buchholz family of Berlin. Being himself a 
distinguished historian, Professor Fredericq 
has much to say about writings in his own de- 
partment. Two books are singled out as par- 
ticularly important: Professor Vanderkindere's 
"La Formation Territoriale des Principautes 
Beiges an Moyen Age," and M. Leo Errera's 
" Les Juifs Busses," which declares the alter- 
natives to be emancipation and extermination. 
Flemish writers are also briefly discussed. 
Professor Logeman's reexamination of the 
connection between " Elckerlijk " and " Every- 
man " is of timely interest. Mile. Marie 
Belpaire studies the village novelists, from 
Conscience to Herr Bjornson, in "Het Land- 



54 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



leven in de Letterkunde." " The strongest 
dramatic work of the year has been the social- 
istic play by the well-known novelist M. Buysse, 
* Het Gezin Van Paemel,' which shows small 
Flemish farmers at warfare with their village 
lord, their clergyman, the gamekeepers, and 
gendarmes, all conspiring to grind them down 
and reduce them to despair." 

Since Dr. Tille wrote his last Bohemian ar- 
ticle, the foremost Bohemian poet, Mr. Jaroslav 
Vrchlicky, has celebrated his fiftieth birthday, 
and added three books to his list : " Votive 
Tablets," "The Soul a Mimosa," and "My 
Country." Mr. Svatopluk Cech's poem, "The 
Reapers," is also new, and affords " a welcome 
proof that his creative powers have in no way 
abated." The Hus celebration has led to a pub- 
lication of all the works of the martyr, many 
of them from manuscripts only recently discov- 
ered. Sir Walter Besant would have been glad 
to welcome the following piece of news : 

"Amongst other prominent events in our literary 
world is the realization of a project which was men- 
tioned in last year's report. A number of Bohemian 
writers have formed an independent publishing society 
called Maj, the chief object of which is to improve the 
material situation of literary men and women in this 
country, and it must be acknowledged that the endeav- 
ours of this new society have in a great measure suc- 
ceeded in promoting the interests of authors. They 
have helped to raise the fees for literary work, to ensure 
a greater share in the profits of books for the writers 
of them, and to protect rights in literary property." 
In belles-lettres , the following books are note- 
worthy : "Passion and Strength," a social 
novel by Mr. Hladik ; "From the Native 
Nest," by Mr. Vaclav Vlcek ; " Books of Remi- 
niscences," by Mr. Ladislav Quis ; " A Ballad 
of a Man and His Joys," by the satirist, Mr. 
Victor Dyk ; and two plays based upon early 
Bohemian history, the work, respectively, of 
Mr. Hilbert and Mr. Alois Jirasek. "The 
History of Bohemian Literature in the Nine- 
teenth Century" is a joint work by several 
writers, and Dr. Tille himself has published a 
book on " The Philosophy of Literature Under 
H. Taine and His Predecessors." 

" The first point to notice about Danish lit- 
erature," writes Dr. Ipsen, " is the rapid in- 
crease of its mass." The novels of the year 
have increased to one hundred and eighty, a 
jump of just fifty per cent, from the year before. 
But the quality of this writing seems to grow 
worse. " It is a ruminating sort of literature ; 
the second generation of naturalism seems no 
longer able to produce vital art, but it has 
developed a rage for writing and a technical 
dexterity in the use of the pen which are aston- 



ishing." Historical fiction is coming back into 
favor, but it is now written by naturalists in- 
stead of romanticists. The chief work of this 
class is "The King of All Sinners," by Mr. 
Laurids Bruun, which " deals with the heredi- 
tary sin which is handed down from father to 
son in unbroken line, and shows how the fate 
of a physically and mentally degenerate indi- 
vidual, in collision with the demands of a merci- 
less and impersonal society, must be tragic." 
The number of women writers is constantly 
increasing, and, as Dr. Ipsen puts it, " every 
year they produce new, heavy books." Many 
of them also " affect a rather vulgar taste, and 
luxuriate in pictures of indelicate and ambigu- 
ous love affairs, with details calculated to arouse 
sensation rather than satisfy the demands of 
the psychologist and the poet." At the head 
of this "feministic school " stands Mrs. Agnes 
Henningsen, whose " Spedalske " treats of " love 
as a sort of contagious, leprous condition " — 
truly a charming conception ! A very differ- 
ent sort of book is " The Mountain Priest," 
by Miss Ingeborg Maria Sick, a tale of an 
orthodox clergyman with whom a modern 
young woman falls in love. " She wins him 
but leaves him, seeing that he, through his 
vehement love for her, is being led away from 
his higher calling and becoming an inferior 
man." Herr Valdemar Rordam's " Gudrun 
Dyre " is " a hymn to sensual love in praise of 
the flesh, an epic in verse with scarcely any- 
thing but love in it, and a theory of the free- 
dom thereof." Peasant literature is represented 
by Herr Johan Skjoldborg's " Gyldholm," 
which " has some brilliant pages on the inter- 
course between the small cottagers and servants 
on a noble estate, but afterwards degenerates 
into a socialistic pamphlet." " The edition of 
the collected works of Dr. Georg Brandes in 
twelve volumes has been finished, and is now 
followed by a reprint of his polemical pamph- 
lets, which it would have been better certainly 
to leave uncollected on account of their bitter- 
ness and injustice." Dr. Alfred Ipsen's criti- 
cal study of this author will soon be completed. 
Dr. Vedel has published " Heroic Life," which 
" pictures the primitive life of the ancient world 
in many countries and phases, as it developed 
under the strong and brilliant rule of war 
and the worship of all the warlike virtues." 
A book somewhat similar in subject, but very 
different in treatment, is Herr Axel Olrik's 
" Ancient Heroic Poems of Denmark." It is 
only a first part, and the author tries to settle 
solid principles for dealing with the old lays, 



1903.]

which often, under the influence of the great 
migration, were changed and remodelled. In 
opposition to the common tendency in the treat- 
ment of the sagas and lays, he tries to carry 
out a poetic and literary principle in his deal- 
ing with them An English edition of the 
book will soon appear." 

In his report upon French literature, M. 
Pravieux begins with the drama. The dram- 
atized novel exists in France also, and is illus- 
trated this year by M. Emile Fabre's stage 
version of Balzac's " Menage de Ganjon," and 
If. Henri Bataille's dramatization of Count 
Tolstoy's " Resurrection." The other note- 
worthy plays of the year are " Theroigne 
de Mericourt," by M. Paul Hervieu ; " Les 
Affaires Sont les Affaires," by M. Octave 
Mirbeau ; " La Chatelaine," by M. Alfred 
Capus : and " L' Autre Danger," by M. 
Maurice Donnay. 

" Novelists, who become more and more numerous 
in France, may be arranged under two heads. Some 
remain faithful to the ancient traditional conception of 
the novel, and confine their studies to one subject only 
— love. But, unfortunately, the public has for a long 
time become blase, and as it is difficult to rejuvenate 
so old a subject as the novel, itself as old as the hills, 
these writers too often think themselves bound to stim- 
ulate the idle curiosity of readers by applying them- 
selves solely to the passions and giving us unwholesome 
pictures in which art has no part. The others, without 
altogether refraining from the portrayal of love either 
in its tragic or its attractive phases, write novels with 
ideas concerning philosophic, social, and religious ques- 
tions. In such cases the novel becomes a pretext, 
or, to be more exact, a process by means of which some 
theme is brought before the general public, which, 
stripped of its fictional covering, would, by its mere 
appearance, scare away the reader. These books are, 
in fact, treatises disguised as novels. This kind of lit- 
erature is now much in vogue in France. Scarcely any 
didactic books are written, or, at least, scarcely any 
that are written are read." 

Among novels of the didactic category we have 
" L'Etape," by M. Paul Bourget ; " Les Deux 
Vies," by MM. Paul and Victor Margueritte ; 
"La Maison du Peche," by Mme. Marcelle 
Tinayre ; " Le Paradis de V Homme," by M. 
Marc Andiol ; " Lettres a Francoise," by M. 
Marcel Prevost ; and "L'Inutile Effort," by M. 
Edouard Rod. In the other category come 
such books as "La Peur de Vivre," by M. 
Henry Bordeaux ; " Le Roman d'un Agrege," 
by M. Leo Claretie ; " Dos d'Ane," by M. Louis 
Boule ; " L'Inconstante," by Mme. Marie de 
Regnier ; and " La Nouvelle Esperance," by 
the Comtesse de Noailles. Of the present 
state of French fiction M. Pravieux says: 

"The critic with sufficient courage to attempt the 
perusal of the innumerable novels published yearly in 



France would doubtless acknowledge that talent is not 
wanting, though genius is not apparent, and master- 
pieces are rare. He would admire the gift of accurate 
and minute observation, the subtle psychology, the force, 
colour, and picturesque quality of the language — ail 
these attributes of our writers' talents; bnt that would 
be the sole profit that our unhappy critic would derive 
from a gigantic task." 

In poetry, factions flourish, and the old order 
is giving place to the new. The Academy now 
crowns verse that violates most of the tradi- 
tional rules, as in the case of volumes by M. 
Fernand Gregh and the Comtesse de Noailles. 
The principal quarrel now is between the 
Parnassians of day before yesterday and the 
Symbolists of yesterday. The latter include 
M. Gustave Kahn, M. Jean More as, and M. 
Henri Regnier. The last-named poet, we are 
informed, " chisels out verse which for sculp- 
tural beauty, clearness of contour, and wisdom, 
is equal to the best work of his master, M. 
Maria de Heredia." Of the method and the 
art of history France is daily approaching a 
cleaner conception. " History has learned the 
lesson of accuracy, and has been initiated into 
the methods of the neighboring sciences — 
natural history, physiology, psychology, and 
social science. At a time when history is get- 
ting more mastery over its methods, and finds 
an increasing popularity among the cultured, 
it also enters into the possession of all sorts of 
hitherto unexploited resources." Noteworthy 
historical works of the year are M. Albert Van- 
dal's " L'Avenement de Bonaparte," M. Paul 
Gautier's " Madame de Stael et Napoleon," 
M. Gabriel Hanotaux's " Histoire de la France 
Contemporaine," and, of particular interest to 
American readers, the work of the Vicomte de 
Noailles, entitled " Marins et Soldats Francois 
en Amerique pendant la Guerre de l'lnde- 
pendance des Etats-Unis." Among works of 
criticism and literary history, M. Gaston Bois- 
sier's " Tacite " is given the first rank. 

" He admires Tacitus without idolizing him. He not 
only praises his merits, but also throws light on his 
weaknesses, taking care to point out, however, that they 
belong more to the age in which he lived than to the 
man himself. This volume arrives in the nick of time 
to correct the false ideas of the illustrious author of the 
1 Agricola ' held by so many. During the second half 
of hist century no one would recognize in him anything 
more than a just judge, a contemner of imperial cor- 
ruption. The next step, to disguise him as a demagogue, 
was one which was quickly taken. I gather from M. 
Boissier's book that Tacitus was not a republican in the 
sense in which we understand the term now." 

Other works in this field are "Andre Chenier," 
by M. Emile Faguet ; " Les Dernieres Annees 
de Chateaubriand," by M. Edmond Bire ;

"L'ltalie des Romantiques," by M. Urbain 
Mengin ; " Hommes et Idees du XIX e Siecle," 
by M. Rene Doumic ; " Vus du Dehers," by 
Dr. Max Nordau ; and " Les Ecrivains et les 
Mceurs," by M. Henry Bordeaux. Philosophy 
and social science have been enriched by M. 
Eugene de Roberty's study of Nietzsche, M. 
Bougie's " Les Idees Egalitaires," M. de 
Lanessan's " La Lutte pour l'Existence et 
l'Evolution des Societes," and M. Vander- 
velde's " L'Exode Rural et le Retour aux 
Champs." Three noteworthy books of travel 
are mentioned : " Au Pays d'Homere," by the 
Baron de Mandat-Grancey ; " Siberie et Cali- 
fornie," by M. Albert Bordeaux ; and " Chez 
les Cannibales," by the Comte Testetich de 
Tolna. M. Pravieux concludes his com- 
mentary by saying that France still worships 
science, although no longer with the blind zeal 
of past years. " Fiction, history, criticism, 
philosophy, and the drama can no longer be 
independent of science — in fact, they are not. 
Even the poet, while allowing greater licence 
to his imagination, recognizes the idea of the 
world which modern physics supply." 

Dr. Heilborn, writing from Germany, takes 
literature in the restricted sense which recog- 
nizes only three classes of productions — plays 
poems, and novels. Since he writes at length 
of the works selected for comment, his report 
is the most interesting of the entire series. 
He begins with some remarks on the sub- 
ject of Herr Sudermann's essays upon " Die 
Verrohung in der Theaterkritik," which he 
takes to be the wail of a disappointed play- 
wright, who has failed to fulfil his early promise, 
and who thus scolds the public for its failure 
to appreciate his work. These essays, he says, 
"were characteristic of their author, for they 
showed with terrible clearness that for Suder- 
mann the artist's manifestation of his powers 
means nothing more than the pursuit of out- 
ward success. They showed a man who has 
been overtaken in the race by more fortunate 
competitors, who has grown nervous and irri- 
table, and who looks for some external cause 
to explain his failure." Of the past year as a 
whole, Dr. Heilborn says that " it has not pro- 
duced a single great and conspicuous work, but 
it has brought forth fruits of quiet and honest 
labour." Some would find an exception to this 
sweeping statement in "Der Arme Heinrich " 
of Herr Hauptmann, which even in the present 
discussion, is placed first and given the most 
extended analysis. 

" Even in his earlier productions Gerhart Hauptmann 



showed a leaning toward mysticism, by which he sought 
to subdue, or at least give depth to, realism. He 
believed in death as the great power that transfigures 
life; he cast round the secrets of the dying hour a 
web of hopeful surmise. In his new play, ' Der arme 
Heinrich,' this mysticism of death has, one may say, 
become a mysticism of life. Therein and therefrom 
must life find its regeneration; in mystic self-absorption 
the sick man must be made whole. At the same time 
mysticism claims a place in the action of the play as 
well; it makes a link in the close- wrought psychological 
chain. The unfortunate Heinrich, smitten by leprosy, 
sets out to seek the physician at Salerno, accompanied 
by the maiden who is ready to sacrifice her heart's 
blood for his sake. He is cured through her unques- 
tioning faith and cheerful self-sacrifice. Not in the 
sense in which the miracle takes place in Hartman von 
Aue's poem: there the knight repents at the critical 
moment, overcome with pity for the fair child whose 
naked body he sees threatened by the surgeon's kuife, 
and so he starts with her apon his homeward journey 
as ill as when he came, till finally his deed of mercy 
awakens God's mercy likewise, and he is freed from his 
disease." 

Next in interest to this work is Herr Arthur 
Schnitzler's " Der Schleier der Beatrice," a 
drama of Bologna and the Renaissance period. 
But this work is a little more than a year old, 
and we cannot spare the space for an account 
of it. " Konig Laurin " is the title of Herr von 
Wildenbruch's new play, which is concerned 
with the Goths after the death of Theodoric. 
Its power is all concentrated in a single scene, 
which is thus described : 

" The Goths, assembled for a carousal, are celebrat- 
ing the memory of their king, Theodoric the Great, 
who has recently died; a young Gothic noble, carried 
away by his enthusiasm, lifts the king's drinking-cup on 
high and speaks — not, however, of Theodoric the Great, 
but of Dietrich of Bern. He has seen Dietrich riding 
in the morning twilight over the sea, his fist clenched 
wrathfully against his foe, and behind him Hildebrand, 
his ancient comrade-in-arms, mounted on a gallant steed. 
He has seen him wrestling with Laurin, King of the 
Dwarfs, in the midst of the downtrodden rosegarden, 
when he robbed him of the cloak of darkness. For 
Dietrich of Bern is not dead any more than his old an- 
tagonist Laurin, the destroyer of all fair men — Laurin, 
who always reappears upon the earth under a new name, 
and who reigns even now as — the Emperor Justinian ! " 

Of Herr Heyse's " Maria von Magdala," we 
read that 

" The conflict he raises in his heroine's breast reminds 
one of Victor Hugo's ' Marion Delorme.' The courtesan, 
who has now expiated the sins of her former life, might 
save Jesus from being crucified, if only she would grant 
an influential Roman access to her chamber; but she 
refuses to do so in the consciousness that unrighteous 
means must needs be abhorrent to Him who is righteous- 
ness itself. But the conflict, as such, seems an impos- 
sible one. It is a degradation of history to combine it 
with motives of such a kind." 

Of plays less weighty in their matter, the fol- 
lowing may be mentioned : " Das Thai des

Lebens," by Herr Dreyer ; " Die Lokalbahn," 
by Herr Ludwig Thoma ; " Der Heerohme," 
by Herr Josef Lauff ; " Ledige Leute," by 
Herr Dbrmann ; " Gerechtigkeit," by Herr 
Otto Ernst ; " Kaltwasser," by Herr Ludwig 
Fulda; and "Das Dunkle Thor," by Hen- 
Felix Philippi. These pieces are farces or 
melodramas, and have little literary merit. 
The drama of popular life seems to be reviv- 
ing, especially in Austria, and is illustrated by 
Herr Josef Werkmann's " Der Kreuzweg- 
stiirmer '" and Herr Karl Schbnherr's " Sonn- 
wendtag." In lyric production, the new 
poems of Frau M. E. delle Grazie, of Herr 
Hugo Salus, of Frl. Agnes Miegel, and Herr 
Heyse's " Ein Wintertagebuch " are men- 
tioned. Turning to prose fiction, we begin 
with Herr Heyse's new "Novellen vom Gar- 
dasee," but the author's "capacity for produc- 
ing direct effects is gone ; his craftsman's hand 
no longer obeys him with absolute certainty. 
He has declined grievously in power of com- 
position, but he still retains his psychological 
cunning, he still finds the intrinsically right 
and necessary solution of his problems." Frau 
von Ebner-Eschenbach, on the other hand, 
although well past seventy, has remained young 
in comparison with the author of " Im Para- 
diese," and " Agave," her new novel, is a fine 
production. " His story centres round a pupil 
of Masaccio, whose life is a perpetual struggle 
to conquer art and win the woman he loves. 
But the youth who has shown rare skill as a 
potter, and in whose designs Masaccio has 
recognized talent of an unusual order, is denied 
the gift of art in its higher form, and the im- 
petuous, madly jealous wooer is denied his 
love." Other fiction of the year comprises 
" Ein Ungliiekliches Volk" (the Armenians), 
by Herr Rudolf Lindau ; "Vita Somnium 
Breve," by Frau Ricarda Huch ; " Die Gottin- 
nen ; oder die Drei Romane der Herzogin von 
Assy " (a trilogy in imitation of Sig. d'An- 
nunzio), by Herr Heinrich Mann ; " Reigen " 
(which "describes various Viennese types in the 
act of satisfying the desires of love "), by Herr 
Arthur Schnitzler : " Freundschaft," a Nor- 
wegian tale by Herr Georg Hirschfeld ; " Der 
Uebergang," by Herr J. J. David ; and 
" Arbeit," by Frau Use Frapan. Concluding 
his article, Dr. Heilborn says : 

" A comparison taken from Dr. Ibsen's * Master- 
builder ' might be applied to the literature of this year. 
No church spires have been erected, nor yet have fancy 
and desire reared any daring castles in the air; but 
none the less have we built homesteads where men can 
dwell — homesteads with nurseries in them."

Half a Century of Yale.* 



No one is better qualified to give an account 
of Yale during the last half-century than Ex- 
President Dwight. As the descendant of a 
former president, as student, tutor, professor 
and president, as acting treasurer for two years 
and occupant of the college pulpit for six and 
a half, he has had every opportunity to become 
thoroughly imbued with the Yale spirit, and to 
make himself master of her traditions and his- 
tory. His intimate personal acquaintance with 
the Yale faculty and Yale men of his time en- 
ables him to present a series of portraits of 
extraordinary interest and fidelity. Even the 
general reader, to whom the university at New 
Haven makes no special appeal, will find these 
pen-portraits well worth examining. The amia- 
ble idiosyncrasies of the old-time college pro- 
fessor are most pleasantly touched upon by a 
sympathetic hand ; and, to him who chooses to 
read between the lines, the artist gives many 
features of his own portrait by showing so in- 
evitably what qualities he most admires in others. 

Yale's remarkable growth in the period under 
review, a growth to which Dr. Dwight contri- 
buted so notably, forms an instructive and en- 
couraging chapter in the history of higher 
education. When Dr. Dwight entered college 
the whole student body was smaller than a 
single class of the present day, and the total 
endowment far less than the annual income 
now enjoyed by the university. The standard 
of scholarship has undergone an equal change 
for the better since the days when the elder 
Silliman, examining candidates in geography, 
made grievous complaint of their defective 
preparation, and cited in illustration the sub- 
freshman's answer to the question, " Who 
founded St. Petersburg ? " " St. Peter," was 
the ingenious answer. (But it parenthetically 
observed, as the author points out, that the 
question had about as little to do with geog- 
raphy as the answer.) Those were the days 
when the Latin professor's task was largely to 
bring Cicero into agreement with Andrews and 
Stoddard's Grammar, and the^teacher of math- 
ematics regarded teaching as the one thing 
farthest removed from his duties. Though 
we are wont to look back upon that period as 
an era of plain living and high thinking, our

author ventures to question the necessary con- 
nection between the two. As appropriate to 
this season, and as illustrating the author's 
genial style, let us cite what he has to say on 
the subject of vacation, then and now. 

" The summer vacation, at that period, continued for 
only six weeks — Commencement Day being the third 
Thursday of August, and the autumn term beginning 
about the twenty-eighth of September. It was not 
then regarded as necessary for the health of young peo- 
ple that they should finish their yearly studies before 
the hot weather arrived, or to that of older persons, 
that they should spend the warm season among the hills 
or by the seaside. Indeed, for the ordinary citizen, 
vacations were not looked upon as an essential part of 
life. They were, in a certain measure, the privilege of 
boys and their teachers — the teachers having the en- 
joyment granted them because it was deemed needful 
that the boys should have it. Why it was universally 
considered so necessary for the boys, we young fellows 
never put ourselves to the task of finding out. Possi- 
bly the task might have been fruitless, if it had been 
undertaken. We accepted the fact, and, raising no 
troublesome inquiries, we felicitated ourselves on the 
good fortune which the world had consented to give us. 
It is half a century since then — and I may say, in 
passing, that I have in all the years followed the wise 
course of my boyhood and have ever avoided the ques- 
tion which I then put aside — adopting in this regard 
the comforting theory that ' what is, is right, and what 
is right is best.' . . . ' Much study is a weariness to the 
flesh'; and so the resting-time was made to follow the 
working-time. . . . The scholar fancies, in his boyhood 
years, that he knows to the utmost the blessing of vaca- 
tion time. But we may pity his ignorance. It is the 
teacher who has the full understanding." 

Dr. Dwight refers more than once, disap- 
provingly, to the Spartan discipline that pre- 
vailed at Yale for many years after his entrance. 
The weeding-out process was carried to an ex- 
cess. In meeting the freshman class for the 
purpose of administering a word of wholesome 
counsel at the outset of the college course, 
President Day was accustomed to remind these 
young hopefuls, as the simplest and most na- 
tural and perhaps most desirable thing in the 
world, — " Doubtless not more than one-half 
your number will graduate." This cheerful 
prophecy was literally fulfilled in the case of 
Dr. Dwight's class. One hundred and ten en- 
tered ; fifty-five achieved the bachelor's degree. 
Not a little of the reform that subsequent years 
have brought in this matter of discipline is due 
to Dr. Dwight himself. 

As the chief charm of this volume lies in its 
life-like portrayal of illustrious men now de- 
ceased, it will not be amiss to quote somewhat 
largely from these character-sketches. Eefer- 
ring to the elder Silliman's kindly attitude 
toward the students, the author relates the 
following : 



" I had presented myself before him, on a certain 
occasion near the end of my academic course, for an 
examination on studies in his department. He asked 
me to take a chair near him in his room, and then, in a 
way peculiar to himself — a way which was very help- 
ful, rather than embarrassing to the student — he ques- 
tioned me on various points for half an hour. Then, 
rising and going to the table, he looked at some papers, 
and, selecting one, said : ' I suppose you would like to 
have me give you a certificate that your examination 
has been satisfactory, which you may hand to the Presi- 
dent.' I gave him, of course, an affirmative answer. 
He then handed me the paper, saying, « Not doubting 
that you would pass, I wrote the certificate before you 
came in.' These last words that he spoke were better, 
if possible, than my assured success. They have re- 
mained in my memory as a part of my mental picture 
of the man." 

But there was nothing weak or childish in this 
mildness of manner. In all cases of grave im- 
portance the old professor was a wise disci- 
plinarian, " a tower of strength," as President 
Woolsey used to call him. When his son, 
Benjamin Silliman, junior, became an in- 
structor in the college, the two were popularly, 
but not disrespectfully, known as Old Ben 
and Young Ben. As the author observes, such 
student appellations are oftener affectionate 
than disrespectful, and the professor who 
chooses to make a grievance of the matter 
may well be advised to seek some other sphere 
of usefulness. 

Those who knew the late Prof. Othniel C. 
Marsh, and who also know Dr. Dwight, will 
appreciate the humor of the following. Refer- 
ring to Professor Marsh and to his own pres- 
idency, the writer says : 

"In his attitude and in his manner of expressing 
himself, a certain formality was characteristic of him. 
Especially was this manifest in cases where he sought 
an interview with others on matters of business, or on 
subjects of interest with respect to his own particular 
work. The slight and somewhat peculiar hesitation in 
his utterance rendered this formality more conspicuous. 
I was always struck with this singularity of manner 
when he called upon me, as he occasionally did, for 
the purpose of securing some minor appropriation 
of money for his department of the museum. . . . 
Whatever the object might be, the manner of the 
man was the same. It was as if we had been two 
ministers of state having little acquaintance with each 
other, who had met for the settlement of some great 
question of public concern. All was serious, with a 
dignified solemnity, and measured with a diplomatic 
deliberateness. My own bearing was, as of necessity, 
determined by his. One could not talk after the ordi- 
nary method, and with the freedom of a common con- 
versation, when the other party in the interview seemed 
to place the subject and the discussion on a plan* so 
much higher. I was not able fully to equal him, but 
my approaches to his standard were, for the time and 
by reason of effort, so near to it that I think he was 
satisfied. I could, indeed, be as immovably serious in 
my look, as he could himself be. This is a gift for

which I have sometimes felt that I ought to be grateful. 
My look, also, in a measure, solemnized my speech; 
and so, with the friendly spirit which we always had, 
we moved on with a reasonable success, fiat I used 
often to think, just after such an interview had closed, 
of the possibilities of the thoughts on the two sides re- 
specting it. Did either of the two parties quite under- 
stand tbe impression produced on the mind of the other? 
Was the look of either quite the same that it had been 
a few moments before ? It is enough, no doubt, to know 
that all is well that ends well." 

President Woolsey's personal force is strik- 
ingly illustrated by an anecdote. A certain 
class, dating about forty years ago, had planned 
an entertainment of some sort, accompanied 
with dancing, and much interest was felt in the 
success of the occasion. But, as is not unusual 
in such college events, considerable partisan 
excitement had been aroused, and this excite- 
ment increased as the appointed day drew near, 
until the final issue became a matter of some 
anxiety. 

" Without the knowledge of the class, the President, 
at a late stage of the controversy, was made aware of 
the condition of things. He met the emergency at once 
in his own mind, and on the morning of the day before 
the entertainment was intended to be given — when all 
thoughts were eager with expectation and doubtful as 
to a peaceful result — he rose in presence of the as- 
sembled company of students, and said: 'I understand 
that a plan has been formed by the Senior Class for a 
ball to-morrow evening, and that much contention has 
arisen in the class respecting certain matters connected 
with it. There will be no ball.' The question was im- 
mediately settled for every member of the class, and the 
excitement died away because its cause was removed." 

The author's views on various matters of col- 
lege education and administration are set forth 
impressively, not to say convincingly. Speak- 
ing of the measure of power to be granted to 
the executive head of a college or university, 
he refers to the extreme view of those who 
would clothe the president with an authority 
similar to that of the head of a great com- 
mercial establishment ; and he also cites the 
suggestion of President Woolsey that the pres- 
ident's office be superseded by something like 
the rectorship prevailing in German univer- 
sities. The Yale system has ever been, and is 
now, a sort of compromise between these two. 
Although the president has the right of veto on 
all faculty action, he governs with the advice 
and consent of his faculty ; and this plan Dr. 
D wight regards as the best, and as adapted, in 
all essential points, to the spirit of the times. 
On the question of shortening the college course, 
now furnishing matter for considerable dis- 
cussion both wise and foolish, Dr. Dwight 
pronounces emphatically for continuing the old 
order of things, and advises the shortening of 



the preparatory curriculum, so that the boy may 
enter college at sixteen or seventeen, instead 
of eighteen or nineteen. He holds that if a 
young man finishes his academic and his profes- 
sional education, and enters on the serious busi- 
ness of life, at twenty-six, that is early enough. 
To all in any way interested in education, as 
well as to those who take a special interest in 
Yale, Dr. Dwight's book is most heartily to be 
commended. The only regret is that its five 
hundred pages of varied and entertaining mat- 
ter are followed by no index. Portraits, as well 
as views of buildings, are lavishly supplied.

The only Presidential, Impeachment 
Trial.* 



No gift of prophecy is required to see that, 
as time gives the proper perspective, the period 
of Reconstruction following the Civil War will 
command a paramount interest in the history 
of our country. As a crisis when the scales 
of life or death for representative government 
trembled at the equipoise, it surpasses any 
moment of the great war which produced it. 
During the time of the appeal to arms, there 
could be little question of the outcome after 
the policy of coercion had been determined 
upon and the people had rallied to the call. 
The overwhelming odds in favor of Northern 
numbers, equipment, and resources, made the 
conquest of the protestants a matter of human 
endurance. Free government was never for an 
instant in real danger in the North. The aim 
was simply the preservation of the Union, with 
all its forms intact. 

But Reconstruction changed Northern feel- 
ings and aims completely. Flushed with 
victory, the conquerors, in their attempt to 
"reconstruct" the Union, struck at the vital 
principles of self-government. The building 
was threatened with destruction in the effort 
to restore it. One portion of the people was 
to be held subject to the other. The policy 
decided on required the erection of an auto- 
cratic empire on free soil. No rights were to 
be accorded a conquered minority. 

But suddenly the action checked itself. A 
unanimity of opinion in this sudden perversion 
was not to be hoped for ; and this very dif- 
ference brought on a conflict between two 
branches of the victorious national govern-

ment, which, while further jeopardizing free- 
dom, distracted attention from the unfortu- 
nate people of the South. 

If the attention of the radicals, whose exist- 
ence was due to the necessary force- measures 
of the war, had not thus been drawn away 
from the objects of their wrath to centre upon 
President Johnson, one hesitates to predict 
the permanent injury which might have been 
wrought to the principles of free government. 
In this sense, Andrew Johnson was a vicarious 
sacrifice. And as such he is pictured in an 
excellent history of his impeachment and trial 
by Mr. David Miller Dewitt. In this, the 
author has not been blind to Johnson's faults, 
although frequently inclined to gloss them 
over. The President by chance faced a prob- 
lem which would have tried the powers of the 
president chosen by the people ; yet " Andrew 
Johnson was not Abraham Lincoln," as the 
author says. " His personal self-sufficiency, 
his unbounded confidence in the rectitude of 
his public acts, and the steady fire of his com- 
bativeness," are phrases which indicate the 
final estimate of him. 

One must not expect this volume to be 
free from partisanship in behalf of Johnson. 
Sometimes this is shown by writing down his 
enemies, especially Stanton. " The Genius of 
Duplicity " is summoned to guard the shade 
of the ex-Secretary of War, as the testimony of 
Sumner is recalled showing Stanton's private 
opinion of Grant while soliciting an office at 
his hands. John Sherman is accused of jug- 
gling the order of charges in the final vote, 
" to avoid an utter loss of self-respect." The 
cry of Sumner for a verdict of " guilty " is 
compared with the tirades of Robespierre in 
the Convention. Thaddeus Stevens, the most 
implacable of Johnson's enemies, is treated with 
greater leniency, perhaps because he was al- 
ways a fair fighter. The accusation is made that 
" the two Nebraska senators fulfilled the con- 
tract of their admission " by voting " guilty." 

In no part of the book is the author more 
interesting than in his description of the dra- 
gooning to which the doubtful senators were 
subjected just before the vote in the Impeach- 
ment trial. " From Maine, from Illinois, from 
Kansas, from Rhode Island, from West Vir- 
ginia, from Tennessee, — resolutions, letters, 
telegrams, delegates, all demanding the con- 
viction of the President and denouncing the 
least hesitation on the part of his Republican 
triers." He shows the risk a statesman runs who 
pares oppose his personal convictions against 



party policy. This was especially true of Sena- 
tor Ross of Kansas, whose political career was 
cut short by his negative vote. Ross wrote a 
vindication of his action, which was printed at 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1896, his place 
of residence at the time, but which the present 
author evidently did not use. Senators Trum- 
bull of Illinois and Doolittle of Wisconsin 
were also conspicuous victims to the vengeance 
of party rule. 

The conclusions from this concise study of 
the trial may be found in these words : 

" Had this first impeachment eventuated in the re- 
moval of the Chief Magistrate, a precedent would have 
been established of the most fatal character — consti- 
tuting a perpetual menace to the stability of our execu- 
tive, a spreading blight upon our character and credit 
as a nation, a standing reproach to the republican form 
of government, and gradually leading to a national habit 
of capricious political convulsions to put one president 
in place of another such as have disgraced some of the 
republics of Central and South America. . . . Never will 
the practice of deposing presidents by political impeach- 
ment become domiciliated in this republic. Centuries 
will pass by before another President of the United 
States can be impeached, unless the offense of which he 
is accused is clearly non-political and amounts unmis- 
takably to a high crime or misdemeanor."

A Century of Explorations.* 



Explorers, archaeologists, philologists, and 
historians have found mines of wealth in the ter- 
ritory commonly designated as " Bible Lands." 
Ruins of ancient cities, temples, palaces, tombs, 
and towers, have yielded large results within 
the past century to the persistent and well- 
equipped explorer. Egypt, Palestine, Syria, 
Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, and Arabia have 
produced rich harvests for the student of an- 
cient oriental times, and of the Bible. 

Professor Hilprecht's bulky volume, of 810 
pages, is an attempt to present in popular 
form the explorations of a century in five 
lands which figure more or less in the Bible. 
The editor has contributed to the book 577 
pages on the " Resurrection of Assyria and 
Babylonia." Of these, the first 288 pages 
summarize the explorations and expeditions in 
those countries from early times down to the 
present, devoting the greater amount of space 
to the activities of the nineteenth century. 
This section traverses largely the same terri-

tory as Rogers, in his "History of Babylonia 
and Assyria," Vol. I. pp. 1-253. In clearness 
and directness of statement it does not equal 
Rogers, but in the multiplicity of facts that are 
presented it surpasses that earlier work. 

The most elaborate section of the volume, 
very naturally, is that devoted to the American 
excavations at Nuffar (pp. 289-568). It 
discusses with minute detail the history and 
pi-ogress of that series of campaigns from 1888 
to the present time. It is evident to the im- 
partial reader, before he gets far into the nar- 
rative, that this section of the book is taking 
on a controversial character. The editor soon 
pits himself against Dr. John P. Peters, the 
director of the first two campaigns (compare 
pp. 321-2, 327-8-9, 339 note 1, 408, 415). 
Throughout the whole of the treatment, the 
reader is now and then so forcibly reminded 
of an unpleasant controversy that his ardor 
over the recital of brilliant discoveries is 
chilled. Disputes and disagreements as to the 
proper method of conducting excavations may 
always arise between leaders of campaigns, but 
it hurts public confidence and public respect to 
witness such wranglings. Professor Hilprecht 
has done valuable service in publishing the 
texts issued some years ago, and in populariz- 
ing information on discoveries in the Orient, 
and in determining some of the technique of 
ancient Nippur. These are certainly eminent 
services to knowledge. Therefore we are the 
more chagrined to find so much valuable space 
and time, in a work for popular circulation, 
given to the discussion of matters that gratu- 
itously disturb the peace of mind of the reader. 

This whole section reveals to us Nippur as 
one of the great cities of a great past. The 
revelations made through the campaigns of the 
University of Pennsylvania must re-cast our 
conceptions of the civilization of Babylonia in 
the fourth and third millenniums B.C., and con- 
sequently greatly modify all former views of 
the beginnings and growth of the most ancient 
civilization of the world. 

The section (pp. 623-690) on " Excava- 
tions in Egypt," by Professor Steindorff, is 
well written, and gives the reader a very fair 
conception of many of the best results of ex- 
ploration on the Nile within a century. - Of 
course, the space at his disposal is manifestly 
cramped, but it has been wisely employed for 
the benefit of the lay reader. 

Professor Hommel has presented (pp. 691— 
752) a good bird's-eye view of " Explorations 
in Arabia." The hazardous work of Glazer 



within recent years has made this dangerous 
field more fascinating and valuable than ever 
before. With the exception of some technical 
philological matters, the reader will get much 
of value in this story. 

"The So-called Hittites and their Inscrip- 
tions " is the theme discussed by Professor 
Jensen of Marburg. His article is an exposi- 
tion of his own method of deciphering the 
Hittite inscriptions, — a method that finds 
in them kinship with the language of modern 
Armenia. This article will be of least interest 
to the popular reader, because of its technical 
matter. 

The entire volume is profusely illustrated ; 
the reproductions from photographs are gen- 
erally admirable, while those made from draw- 
ings are quite uneven in value. The four 
maps accompanying the book are excellent, and 
aid the reader in localizing the travels of explor- 
ers and points of explorations. The volume is 
issued in sumptuous form, printed on calen- 
dered paper, with beautiful clear type, with a 
smaller size in the foot-notes. These foot- 
notes are full of valuable bibliographical mat- 
ter, such as the scholar or investigator may 
wish to examine in further research. The vol- 
ume occupies a position quite unique in the his- 
tory of exploration in Bible lands, and gives to 
the public the editor's large service in this 
great work, — a service whose character and 
scope as here represented have unfortunately 
stirred up a warm contention among scholars.

The Conspirac y of Aaron Burr.* 
One of the most interesting chapters of 
American history is that which relates the 
conspiracy of Aaron Burr. Perhaps the inter- 
est arises from the fact that this episode seems 
to be so wholly out of keeping with the gen- 
eral character of American events. That a 
man of political influence and ability, a former 
leader in republican councils, engaged in the 
prosy profession of law and living in the rather 
unromantie century just past, should suddenly 
take to knight-errantry and set out to win him- 
self an empire, is a matter that we should hardly 
expect to find recorded in our own matter-of- 
fact annals. And the mystery that pervades 
the whole undertaking serves to heighten the 
romance. 

For a long time, historians were in doubt as 

*Thb Aabon Burb Conspiracy. By Walter Flavins 
McCaleb. New York : Dodd, Mead, & Co. 



62 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



to what Burr's real purposes were. Did the 
conspirators plan to wrest Mexico from Spain, 
or the Mississippi Valley from the United 
States? Or did their purpose embrace both 
these ends ? For nearly a century the problem 
waited for a satisfactory solution ; but when 
Mr. Henry Adams, in his masterly history of 
the Jeffersonian period, declared Burr a traitor, 
it was thought that the matter had been finally 
disposed of. The evidence seemed conclusive, 
and scholars settled down to the belief that in 
the early years of the nineteenth century a vast 
conspiracy existed in the West looking toward 
the establishment of a mighty empire extending 
from Pittsburg to Panama. 

But the present year has produced a work 
on this subject which students of history will 
read with great interest. Dr. McCaleb's work 
is the result of several years' research; it makes 
a book of about 350 pages, and impresses 
the reader as a remarkably thorough effort. 
In addition to the older, fairly well-known, 
material, the author has made use of sources 
hitherto unknown. His exploitation of Texan, 
Mexican, and British archives, has added much 
to our knowledge, not only of Burr's conspiracy, 
but also of kindred subjects. 

Dr. McCaleb takes the position that Burr's 
plans were directed against Mexico only. The 
evidence formerly relied on to prove Burr's 
traitorous intentions exists in the form of a few 
letters. There is also the testimony of Gen- 
erals Wilkinson and Eaton; but no historian 
who values his reputation would dare depend 
on their statements. The former is infamous 
as the most successful traitor, and one of the 
most consummate prevaricators, that our his- 
tory knows. The latter is also a suspicious 
character. Dr. McCaleb is certainly safe in 
arguing that a man who could urge the Presi- 
dent to send as our minister to Spain or En- 
gland one whom he knew to be intriguing with 
the representatives of those very nations, and 
to have threatened to assassinate the President 
and to loot the capital, can hardly be accepted 
as a trustworthy witness. 

Mr. Henry Adams lays great stress on Burr's 
own statements to the English and Spanish 
ministers. But Dr. McCaleb contends that 
these were but " a consummate piece of impos- 
ture." Burr needed funds, and England and 
Spain were thought willing to assist any ven- 
ture that looked toward the dismemberment of 
our Union. Hence they were asked to finance 
a fictitious revolt or to pay for mythical secrets. 
This interpretation is at least plausible. 



Burr's famous letter of July 29, 1806, in 
which he unfolds his plans to General Wilkin- 
son, has long been looked on as furnishing the 
key to the whole conspiracy. But Dr. McCaleb 
shows that this letter is capable of at least two 
interpretations, of which the older seems the 
least probable. The author also makes good 
use of Clark's letter to Wilkinson, which Mr. 
Henry Adams construes as a warning against 
one Mr. Minor, of Natchez, who was supposed 
to have revealed the secrets of the conspirators. 
But the letter, when cited in full, appears to be 
more than this : it is a warning against' a man 
who invents and circulates absurd tales. 

The author is not satisfied with weakening 
the evidence of the prosecution. He proceeds 
with a positive argument along three principal 
lines: The West hated Spain, and longed for 
an opportunity to help liberate Mexico ; the 
Mississippi Valley was loyal to the Union, not 
even the Creoles at New Orleans plotted sedi- 
tion ; the panic that struck the country when 
Burr's expedition finally started south was 
largely the result of Wilkinson's activity in 
circulating false and alarming reports. The 
parts of Dr. McCaleb's work that deal with the 
state of public sentiment in the West are 
particularly strong and enlightening. 

The older view is manifestly shaken. Burr 
himself may have had traitorous designs, but 
that cannot be known. The author rarely tries 
to apologize for Burr, and succeeds rather 
poorly when he does try. But the New York 
lawyer was not alone in the conspiracy. With 
him were associated such men as Blenner- 
hassett, Dayton, Senator Smith, and perhaps 
Andrew Jackson. It is hard to believe that 
these and others, knowing the opinions of their 
neighbors, would join in a venture that public 
sentiment would not support for a moment. 

In some respects, Dr. McCaleb's book is not 
wholly satisfactory. The author at times al- 
most ceases to be a historian and becomes 
something of an advocate. And in this con- 
nection it should be said that his treatment of 
Jefferson is rather unfair. Burr, on the other 
hand, is permitted to display his better side 
almost continuously ; it is to be feared that the 
picture of the conspirator which would develop 
in the mind of the general reader would be 
decidedly unlike the original. Perhaps the 
literary critic will tell us that the unity of 
style is largely impaired by the introduction of 
documentary material into almost every page 
of the text. But after all these things have 
been said, the fact remains that Dr. McCaleb

has presented his thesis in a clear, scholarly and 
convincing manner. That he has made a nota- 
ble contribution to American history, cannot be 
doubted. Whether the world of scholarship 
will accept his conclusions, remains to be seen.

A book by Mr. Robert Hicbens is sore to offer 
something disagreeable for oar contemplation, and

case it is a woman who is a morphine-eater, and the 
effects of this loathsome rice are studied with un-

innocent youth of twenty — so innocent, in fact, 
that he does not discover the failing of his divinity 
until late in the chapter, although it is Polichinelle's 
secret to the rest of the world. The trouble with 
Felix is that he thinks he knows life when he 
doesn't. This delusion is born of the singular cir- 
cumstance that when he leaves the public school, 
instead of going to the university he packs off to 
France, and spends a year in a provincial town. 
While there he makes the acquaintance of a tailor 
who once made a pair of trousers for Balzac, and

since. This starts Felix to reading the " Comedie 
Humaine," which he devours from first to last. 
Thus equipped, he believes that he knows the 
human heart in all its manifestations, and goes 
home to apply his knowledge. He falls an easy 
victim to the morphinomane, and when he learns 
the truth, his faith in books — even in the books of 
M. de Balzac, — is considerably shaken. The story 
is thoroughly unpleasant; it can profit no one to 
read, and may not even be described as enter- 
taining. 

Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim, who gave us "The 
Traitors " a few weeks ago, now gives us " A Prince 
of Sinners." On the whole, we prefer the weaver 
of adventurous romance in an imaginary Balkan 
kingdom to the topical novelist of modern London. 
'• A Prince of Sinners " gives us dubious philan- 
throphy of the social settlement type and bad 
economics in a defence of the miserable sophistries 
of protectionism. The hero is a young man who es- 
pouses both these causes, and who at the same time 
carries on two love affairs so skilfully that we are 
kept guessing until the very end. The piince of 
sinners is the father of the youth, who had deserted 
wife and child many years before, and caused a 
fictitious report of his death to be spread abroad 
When he reappears in England, it is as the wealthy 
Earl of Arranmore (he having succeeded unexpect- 
edly to the title and estates), and in his endeavor 
to be helpful to the career of his son (who does 
not recognize him for a time) the relationship is 
discovered. Even then the son will not accept his 
newly-found father, but persists in the attempt to 
carve out his own career under his assumed name. 
It is a case of pride against pride, but in the end 
the older man makes a great concession, and the 
younger man gives in. The lesser social types 
depicted are presented with an easy skill that be- 
tokens familiarity with several phases of modern 
English life. Barring the inherent improbability 
of its scheme, the story is a readable one. 

Mr. F. Frankfort Moore has gone back to Crom- 
well's ravaging of Ireland for the subject of his 
latest novel, " Castle Omeragh." The action covers 
the period from Drogheda to Clonmel, and we are 
given a vivid picture of the horrors which have 
made " the curse of Cromwell" a potent and sinister 
watchword to this day. These dreadful happenings 
are kept mostly in the background, but we are 
made to realize them none the less, and to under- 
stand how they have kept Irish passion inflamed 
ever since. The actual theme of the romance is 
the attempt of a small detachment of Cromwell's 
forces to capture an outlying stronghold, and the 
eventual triumph of its defenders. A double love- 
story figures conspicuously in the plot, which is 
interesting and well-developed, and open to crit- 
icism only on account of its serious use of the 
supernatural motive of crystal-gazing. Cromwell 
himself appears briefly upon the seene in the closing 
chapters.

to our reading-table, for his mastery of ingenious 
and humorous romance insures us a session of enjoy- 
ment whenever a new book comes to hand from his 
pen. The number of his books is now sixteen — a 
fact which we hardly realized until we counted them 
in the list which accompanies the new volume — and 
nearly every one of the sixteen evokes some memory 
of delight. " The Adventures of Harry Revel " is a 
story of the surprising adventures of a foundling, who 
leaves the institution that has sheltered his child- 
hood to become an apprenticed chimney-sweep. His 
experiences in this capacity soon launch him upon a 
surprising series of adventures, which end by his 
taking ship for Portugal as a bugle-boy in the En- 
glish army. The time is that of the Peninsular 
War, and the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo occupies 
the closing chapters. The story is told in the first 
person, and the hero is only fifteen years of age 
when we take leave of him, but it must not be in- 
ferred from this fact that the book is one of merely 
juvenile interest. Far from this, it deals with such 
matters as the murder of a Jewish miser, a smug- 
gling episode on the Cornish coast, the mock 
marriage of a beautiful girl, and the Virgilian 
translations of her venerable father. With all these 
things the boy becomes mixed up as a witness, and 
occupies the centre of the stage most of the time. 
Nor must we forget the quaint and delightful figure 
of the old maid whose special charge he is at the 
foundling's home, and whose addiction to verse- 
writing provides the author with an opportunity for 
the display of his most genial humor. 

With every new novel by Mrs. Henry Dudeney, 
we feel more and more impressed with the idea 
that a mantle of similar cut to the one worn by Mr. 
Thomas Hardy rests upon her shoulders. This vari- 
ation of the usual metaphor is necessary because Mr. 
Hardy is fortunately still living. Mrs. Dadeney's 
rustics are of the same race as Mr. Hardy's, and 
her account of their environment gives us a similar 
sense of the earthiness that clings to unsophisticated 
humanity everywhere. She gives us with marvel- 
ous fidelity the raciness, the dry humor, the super- 
stitious notions, and the peculiarities of dialect that 
survive in rural England to this day, and that con- 
tact with culture seems powerless to modify. This 
persistence of rude primeval types of life and 
thought in the vicinage of civilized conditions is 
impressed upon us with singular force by the two 
novelists whose names are thus naturally linked to- 
gether, and remains dominant in our recollection of 
their work. Yet " Robin Brilliant," Mrs. Dadeney's 
new novel, is by no means chiefly concerned with 
rustics; on the contrary, its" interest is centred al- 
most wholly about a man and a woman who stand 
for generations of aristocratic culture, and the back- 
ground of village and rural life serves only as artistic 
relief. But somehow the background strikes us as 
being the most genuine part of the book. The char- 
acters of both hero and heroine are wrought with 
exceeding subtlety of analysis — the woman even 
more so than the man, as is inevitable in a woman's 



novel — but the pale cast of thought that comes 
with over-civilization makes it impossible for either 
of them to act with conviction and determination. 
The right path, the path of contentment, if not 
happiness, lies plainly before them both, but the 
man wavers, and the woman balks at decision, and 
the outcome is satisfaction with a lower ideal for 
the one, and a future of proud but dreary isolation 
for the other. Modern life affords such types and 
such situations, no doubt, but they are not creditable 
to modern civilization. 

" Frank Danby " is the pen-name of a woman 
who writes novels under the tutelage of Mr. George 
Moore. At least, this was formerly the case, but 
since a recent acrimonious exchange of discourtesies 
between the two in the columns of " The Saturday 
Review," we presume that the relation of master 
and disciple has been dissolved. We are not ac- 
quainted with the earlier books of this writer, but 
her new novel "Pigs in Clover," is calculated to 
attract attention. The influence of Mr. Moore's 
literary methods is evident in the realism of this 
social study and in its unabashed handling of dis- 
agreeable types and situations. In the interest of 
the story she has to tell, we should say that the 
pupil had outdone the teacher. We do not alto- 
gether approve of the artistic methods which she 
employs, but are all the time impressed by the fact 
that the work is a product of an intensely conscious 
art, in which every effect is carefully planned, and 
nothing left to chance on the impulse of the moment. 
" Pigs in Clover " is not an engaging title, and will 
probably keep many readers from the book thus 
unfortunately christened. It is the contemptuous 
phrase which one of the characters — a blue-blooded 
lady — uses to describe the nouveaux riches of 
English society. The particular application of this 
phrase is to the South African millionaire, for the 
time covered by the novel includes just the years in 
which the mining-fields of the Rand reached their 
highest development, the years preceding and in- 
cluding the raid of Dr. Jamieson and its striking 
consequences. Rhodes and other actual characters 
figure in the novel under their own names ; still 
others appear in easily penetrated disguises. The 
political point of view maintained by the writer is 
that of imperialism, and she justifies the English 
attitude during the years that preceded the out- 
break of the war by pleading the paramount interest 
of a superior over an inferior civilization. The 
brutality of the individual Boer and the corruption 
of the Boer government are painted in colors so 
dark that any measures, whether of defence or 
aggression, seem warranted. The book is not, how- 
ever, in its essence, a novel of Boer and English- 
man in South Africa; it is a novel of Jew and 
Gentile, of parvenu and aristocrat, in London. Still 
more essentially is it a novel of individual passion, 
of the incredible lengths to which a woman's de- 
votion may lead her, even when the object of her 
attachment is a man of the most despicable mean- 
ness and selfishness. For with all its variety of

other interests, this is the leading motive of the 
novel, and this is the relation which brings it to a 
tragic close. It is hard for as to accept as possible 
a woman so enslaved as Joan, or the power to charm 
of so miserable a wretch as Louis Althaus. That 
the author holds in deadly earnest her belief in the 
reality of the relation she so remorselessly depicts 
is made evident by the striking statement made of 
her thesis in advance of its application : 

"There is a mystery known to all who know men and 
women, to all who have insight into, sympathy with, or 
understanding of, their fellow-travellers, bnt it is blank and 
incomprehensible to the Pharisees, and to all who would read 
and ran at the same time. This is a mystery that fills the 
divorce courts, mocks the incredulous, and sets at naught all 
creeds and convictions. It is that a certain something, subtle, 
sweet, and rare, not a perfume, not a touch, but an echo of 
both, light, elusive, all-pervading, is the special property of 
some loose-living men, a property that is beyond the reach of 
analysis, but recognisable in the freemasonry of the passions 
by all who have realised its existence. It is as the candle to 
the moth, as the rose to the butterfly, as the magnet to the 
steel. It is a surface lure of sex, it is an all-compelling 
whisper, almost it seems that to hear it is to obey." 

This passage, which cannot fail to attract the 
attention of the most casual reader, will doubtless 
be singled out, and rightly so, by every serious 
reviewer as the most noticeable thing in the book. 
And yet, convinced as we may be of its truth, the 
application in the present instance strains our cred- 
ulity to the breaking-point. "We may account for 
the second of the two women whom the man of 
fatal fascination gets into his toils, for she is intel- 
lectually undeveloped, and of the type that falls an 
easy prey to such seductions. But with Joan the 
case is widely different. She is a woman of char- 
acter, will-power, and intellectual ability — to put 
it bluntly, she is Miss Olive Schreiner externally 
modified for the specific purposes of the novel — 
and we are unwilling to admit that a woman of 
this type could be brought permanently under the 
obsession which the author of "Pigs in Clover" 
would have us accept. The situation seems to us 
radically untrue, and for this reason, for this reason 
only, profoundly immoral. 

We commonly think of Wolfe's victory at Quebec 
as ending the struggle between France and England 
for the possession of North America. But it must 
be remembered that for four years after that mem- 
orable engagement on the Plains of Abraham the 
two nations were still at war, and were technically 
enemies in the New World no less than in the Old. 
Their ambitions forever thwarted in Canada, the 
French still had hopes in the Southwest, and were 
intriguing with the Indian tribes of Mississippi and 
Tennessee for the furtherance of their designs. 
Their idea seems to have been to organize a con- 
federacy of Choctaws, Chickasawg, and Cherokees, 
which, in alliance with the French, should oppose a 
formidable barrier to the English advance over the 
mountains, and which should occupy in the South 
a position not unlike that occupied in the North by 
the Long House of the Iroquois nations. These 
plans and this situation form the historical setting 



of Miss Murfree's latest novel, " A Spectre of 
Power." The time is the last year of the Seven 
Years' War, and the scene is placed in those Great 
Smoky Mountains which the author has so often 
described in the glowing language of enthusiasm. 
An exceedingly interesting story is built up about 
these historical and geographical accessories, a story 
of military operations and diplomatic intrigue, of 
romantic love and picturesque Indian adventure. 
Miss Murfree has made a careful study of the 
Tennessee Indians of the eighteenth century, and 
she possibly makes this fact a little too evident, for 
not only are there notes at the back of the volume, 
but there are also interspersed through the text 
many matters of Indian dialect, folk-lore, and cere- 
monial that are not altogether to be justified by the 
exigencies of the plot. A better reason for their 
being may be found in taking them as necessary 
contributions to the study of Indian character which 
is brought into the plot with great ingenuity and 
sympathetic understanding. The author is not con- 
tent with the externals that satisfy most writers of 
this sort of fiction, but must give us the psychology 
of her Cherokees. It is certainly a subtle psychol- 
ogy, fairly supported by the historical evidences 
adduced here and there, and is artistically convinc- 
ing. Of its absolute truthfulness we have no au- 
thority to speak, nor do we greatly care about the 
matter. Considered simply as a story, " A Spectre 
of Power " is extraordinarily interesting and its 
literary workmanship is very fine indeed. We 
rather resent the way in which the affections of the 
captivating Miss Lilias are shifted from the French- 
man to the Highlander, but the latter turns out a 
tolerably acceptable hero after all, although at first 
he appears to be a peculiarly graceless cub. The 
phrases in which the author describes the mountain 
scenery of the country she knows so well have all 
the old charm for us ; they constitute an impassioned 
form of prose that appeals powerfully to the poeti- 
cal sensibilities, while remaining prose in the 
strictest sense, and never degenerating into merely 
rhapsodical utterance. It is many years since Miss 
Murfree has given us as extensive a performance 
as the present one, and her book is very welcome 
indeed. 

English, French, and Indians are again brought 
into romantic relations for us in " Love Thrives in 
War," a story by Miss Mary Catherine Crowley. 
The opening year of the War of 1812 provides the 
historical setting for this romance of Northwestern 
history, which begins with Hull's disgraceful sur- 
render of Detroit, and ends with the reoccupation 
of the city by the American forces. Tecumseh, the 
Prophet, and Tippecanoe are among the many his- 
torical characters who appear. The story as a 
whole is rather lifeless, and suffers severely in com- 
parison with the distinguished work of Miss Mur- 
free. The characters are of the hackneyed conven- 
tional sort, and every incident of the action is of a 
type that has been used hundreds of times before.

THE DIAL 



[Aug. 1, 



is making marked advances in the pursuit of her 
art. Her new novel, "A Voice in the Desert," has 
both delicacy and charm ; it can hardly be said to 
possess strength. The story is of the Southwest, pre- 
sumably Arizona, and concerns a few transplanted 
Easterners, noting the fascination of desert life for 
each and all of them, and depicting its subtly modify- 
ing influence upon their characters. Life under these 
conditions seems to grow tranquil if not apathetic, 
and the natural human passions assert themselves 
but languidly. One of the characters — the clergy- 
man's wife — indeed revolts, and makes her escape; 
but even she returns after a season, impelled by the 
desert fascination. A sand-storm adventure, graph- 
ically depicted, lends a certain degree of excitement 
to the closing chapters, and helps to bring about 
the final sentimental adjustment. 

Mrs. Alice Prescott Smith's "The Legatee," is 
not unlike the book just mentioned in its general 
characteristics. It has a charm that almost amounts 
to distinction but is somewhat lacking in the elements 
of strength. The scene is a Wisconsin lumber town, 
with its mixed population of Belgians, Swedes, and 
native Americans, and the time is about thirty years 
ago. The characteristics of village life, with its 
petty preoccupations, its dull round of toil, and its 
narrow religious bigotry, are given us from intimate 
knowlege with an unsparing pen. In one respect 
we think that the writer errs. A labor agitation 
occupies an important part in the story, and the 
type of thought and activity portrayed is one fa- 
miliar enough to us nowadays, but one which had 
hardly appeared in this country as early as 1870. 
A wayward and altogether charming heroine is 
found in the daughter of the village physician, and 
the not unsatisfactory hero is the Southerner who, 
as his uncle's legatee in the ownership of the lum- 
ber mills, finds his coming heralded by prejudice, 
and his every act met with suspicion. How he 
eventually conquers respect and sympathy is inter- 
estingly described. The disastrous forest fires of 
the autumn of 1871 are made use of in the final 
chapters, and bring the narrative to a picturesque 
and dramatic close. The author of this novel is a 
young woman, and "The Legatee" is her first book. 
We are bound to say that she has made a more than 
creditable beginning of what we trust may prove a 
successful literary career. 

"Under the Rose," by Mr. Frederic S. Isham, 
is a historical romance of the time of Francis I. 
The Duke of Friedwald, seeking the hand of a 
princess of the royal family, makes all the necessary 
negotiations, and then repairs to the court disguised 
as a jester, in order to make the acquaintance of 
his future consort in an unconventional way. Mean- 
while, a notorious robber baron, learning of the 
Duke's matrimonial ambitions, plots to cut off his 
journey to the court, and himself, impersonating 
the Duke, endeavors to consummate a marriage 
before the imposture shall be discovered. A pretty 
situation is thus developed, but it ends somewhat 
unexpectedly, for the jester-duke, after thwarting the 



schemes of his rival, becomes enamoured of another 
woman, and the princess is tricked of both pros- 
pective husbands. The matter of the romance is too 
thin to keep up a sustained interest, and the trap- 
pings of the various scenes are too artificial to make 
any impression of verisimilitude. In a word, the 
story drags all the way through, and displays little 
of the true quality of romance. 

This quality is provided, on the other hand, in 
superabundant measure by Mr. Harold MacGrath 
in his romance of " The Grey Cloak." This book 
is preeminently an example of " how to do it," as 
contrasted with the "how not to do it" example 
of Mr. Isham's story. It is historical enough to' 
satisfy the conscience of those readers who would 
balk at a work of fiction which was pure invention, 
yet it has invention enough to gratify the most 
ardent passion for exciting adventure. It has, 
moreover, a literary quality that is at least respect- 
able, and that does not suffer overmuch from pad- 
ding and cheap rhetorical devices. The character- 
izations are excellent after the stagy fashion that is 
inevitable in such a story, and the sequence of in- 
cident is surprisingly well-knit. Historically, the 
book is a romance of the time of Mazarin, the scene 
being about equally divided between Old and New 
France. Thus we get court intrigue and roystering 
in the first half, and in the second half garrison 
life and Indian adventure. Taken altogether, this 
romance is one of the best of its kind ; its interest 
is unflagging, and it affords an abundant measure 
of not unprofitable entertainment. 

For the second time, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page 
presents us with a novel of large dimensions. The 
new work is entitled " Gordon Keith," and suffers 
somewhat in the comparison with " Red Rock " for 
the reason that its interest is more scattered, and 
its plan does not have so definite a historical back- 
ground. It is essentially a novel of the personal 
fortunes of the hero, who is the son of a Virginian 
gentleman of the old school. The war has ruined 
the family fortunes, the plantation has fallen into 
the hands of an alien, and the boy is thrown upon 
his own resources. How he achieves success from 
humble beginnings, struggling for an education, 
teaching a country school, getting work as a mining 
engineer, and eventually acquiring large interests 
in the enterprise which his energy has developed 
— this is the outline of his career. The setting is 
greatly diversified, including the life of the planta- 
tion, experiences in the lawless mining community 
of the Virginia mountains, seenes in the homes and 
marts of New York, and episodes of foreign travel. 
There are also characters in almost bewildering va- 
riety, and we barely become acquainted with one set 
when we are hurried away into another company. 
All of these scenes and characters, together with the 
author's many dramatic and sentimental inventions, 
are united in a structure of reasonable coherency, 
yet one that is not easy to keep in view as a whole. 
Ethically, the story always rings true ; its ideals are 
of the sincere and manly type, and the hero in

whom they are chiefly embodied is one whom it is 
a pleasure to follow on his toilsome path to success. 
Mr. Page is too practised a hand at novel-writing 
to allow the interest to flag, to hold the reader too 
long in suspense at critical moments, or to make 
any of the false moves that so frequently lessen the 
effectiveness of otherwise excellent works of fiction. 

The late Colonel Stanton Elmore, of the Confed- 
erate army, who died in London a few years ago, 
left certain manuscripts, among which was a novel 
called "A Gentleman of the South." This is 
now edited and published by Mr. "William Garrott 
Brown. These facts are gravely stated in the 
preface to the novel, and we record them with 
equal gravity, but we have a dark suspicion that 
the Colonel and his story alike are creations of the 
editor's invention. The story is a simple one, 
related in admirable English, and deals with the 
after consequences of an old family feud originated 
by the father of the leading character. Of this 
character, and the age in which he lived, the puta- 
tive writer says that they belong " to a world so 
completely vanished that I sometimes feel as if I 
never lived in it save in dreams. It was a world 
so different from the present, and governed by such 
different laws that I am not at all confident of get- 
ting any reader's credence for the story I wish to 
tell. Many will doubtless think it impossible that 
men should within this century have lived such 
lives, obeyed such codes, set themselves such 
standards." Although the story is a simple one, 
it is a little difficult in exposition, and inference 
must be kept busy in the opening chapters before 
we come to a clear understanding of the relations 
existing between the small group of persons con- 
cerned. The atmosphere clears after awhile, and 
the narrative then goes straight forward to its 
tragic ending. There is a delicate distinction about 
the author's style that is grateful to the literary 
sense, but Mr. Brown may hardly be said to have 
the gift of the novelist, and his peculiar powers 
appear to better advantage in the essay and the his- 
torical study. 

Mr. Harben's novel ealled "The Substitute" is 
the sort of book that exists chiefly for the opportu- 
nity which it offers for the author to work off a 
collection of long-winded yarns about nothing in 
particular and other examples of homely rustic 
humor. The material thus offered seems genuine, 
and is doubtless for the most part observed rather 
than imagined. The scene is Northern Georgia, 
and most of the characters are plain country folk 
who speak the vernacular. An old man, who has 
committed a crime in his youth, is so filled with 
remorse in remembrance thereof, that he seeks in 
some way to atone for it. He hits upon the original 
plan of picking out a promising youth, educating 
and giving him a start in life, and making a man 
of him generally. This young fellow is to be the 
substitute which he presents to society in place of 
himself. The hero thus brought into being proves 
an interesting personality, and his love affairs come 



out happily. But the thread of the narrative is a 
slender one, and the book must stand or fall by its 
character sketches. Mr. Harben's particular field 
is one that was long ago preempted by Richard 
Malcolm Johnston, but we think that the genial old 
Colonel, could he have lived to read this book by 
his successor, would have bestowed upon it his 
smiling approval. 

Messrs. Boone and Brown, who collaborated in 
the writing of " Eastover Court House," have again 
joined forces in the production of a Virginia novel. 
" The Redfields Succession " is the title of this 
book, which tells how an impecunious newspaper 
reporter comes unexpectedly into possession of a 
Virginian estate, enjoys it for awhile, learns that 
he has no moral right to it after all, sacrifices it by 
resorting to what verges upon a criminal device, 
and in the end is suitably rewarded for what he 
has done. The scene of the story is laid in Vir- 
ginia, for the most part, and has a good deal to do 
with fox-hunting and other less strenuous social 
festivities. The book has no style worth speaking 
of, and its plot is of the most elementary sort, but 
it is the product of intimate first-hand observation, 
and has an easy-going quality that makes it pleasant 
reading.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



Having written an international novelette in which a 
bright but penniless American girl weds a stupid En- 
glishman of family and little else, Lilian Bell (Mrs. 
Arthur Hoyt Bogue) follows it with a sequel, "The 
Dowager Countess and the American Girl " (Harper). 
It is the sort of story that does not make for interna- 
tional amenity. From it one gleans that all the En- 
glishmen of the better class are debauchees, and none 
of their women chaste. The heroine is an undesirable 
ideal of an American woman; generally speaking, she 
acts like a snob, dresses like a cocotte, and speaks a 
various language, partly ungrammatical and partly 
slang, — and that without being in the least aware of 
it. That the book is interesting is, however, unde- 
niable — much in the way in which an en/ant terrible is 
interesting to its parents. 

Mrs. Burton Harrison's new novelette, " The Unwel- 
come Mrs. Hatch " (Appleton), is a story of a woman 
with a past who cannot live it down, although her sin 
was without premeditation, and her career thereafter 
exemplary. The author's motive seems to have been 
divided between her sympathy for the woman and her 
knowledge that she cannot be upheld in the face of our 
literary and social conventions. The result is disastrous 
to the unity of the work, and leaves its conclusion ab- 
solutely impotent. If such a theme is not to be treated 
with the frankness of the French, it had best be left 
alone, — a conclusion reflecting rather upon the author's 
art than her good will. There is no compromise, evi- 
dently, with the Sunday School story. 

" The Tu-Tze's Tower " is the unusual name of an 
unusual book by Miss Louise Betts Edwards, published 
by Messrs. H. T. Coates & Co. The heroine, a woman of 
birth, refinement, and station, is nevertheless possessed 



68

[Aug. 1, 



of a wanderlust. This has led her to wed an explorer, 
and the book opens with his death in the interior of 
China, stricken down before he could attain his goal in 
the country of the Man-Tze, an independent and preda- 
tory folk on the Chinese frontier. He bequeathes to his 
widow the task of searching out this people and making 
them known to the anthropological world. It will be 
seen that the promise for unusual complications is great 
when it is said that the Tu-Tze, the ruler of this people, 
falls in love with the pretty widow and refuses to take 
" no " for an answer. And, indeed, few fresher and 
more readable stories have been set before the people 
recently. There is abundant humor and considerable 
character study, mingled with the most thrilling events. 
The one drawback to the book will be found in its 
rather desultory beginnings ; these past, it will be diffi- 
cult to lay down. 

Mr. Morgan Robertson has succeeded in writing 
"Sinful Peck" (Harper) with never a feminine char- 
acter in it from cover to cover. The result is rather 
refreshing in these days of insistent "heart interest." 
The book continues the story of the crew of lake sailors 
who once manned the good ship " Almena " and brought 
its voyage to an untimely conclusion, as told in an earlier 
tale by Mr. Robertson. In the present narrative the 
author brings into notice the recent statutes for the 
better protection of seamen, in the enactment of which 
he can assert no small share. The book is eminently 
readable by those who like sea stories — and what man 
does not? 

Having given a weaver and poacher of northern En- 
gland certain heroic qualities, Mr. C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne 
has little difficulty in keeping him heroic in several 
ways, in his new book, " Thompson's Progress " (Mac- 
millan). "Thompson" attains great commercial suc- 
cess, and at the same time is able to marry successfully 
and to keep up his out-of-door habits. Like so many 
recent stories, this is told in episodes, each complete 
in itself, though forming a continuous whole. The book 
is really interesting, its one defect being found in its 
author's failure to eliminate the repetitions that its 
serial publication demanded, wholly needless in the 
printed volume. 

The person who conceals his identity behind the 
initials " J. P. M.," or its partial expansion into " J. P. 
Mowbray," has written a story of the South of to-day 
under the title of " The Conquering of Kate " (Double- 
day). It deals, as did its predecessor, with life in that 
part of Pennsylvania which is rather of the old South 
than of the North. There is a selection of types from 
the folk of the locality, some of them of the "poor 
white " class, and all of them unusual and interesting. 
The book has a tendency to melodrama foreign to this 
writer's earlier work, all of the characters unnecessary 
for the fall of the curtain meeting with sudden death, 
— by no means the most artful of devices. 

A quaint little story of early New England is told by 
Mrs. C. Emma Cheney in " Mistress Alice Jocelyn, her 
Letters: In Which be set Forth an English Maydes 
Voyage to the Province of Maine, and what did Befall 
her Thereafter " (The Blue Sky Press). Told, as the 
title indicates, in epistolary form, the first of the little 
letters is dated at Black Point in the province of Maine, 
August 20, 1642, while the last brings the story down 
to Christmas Day in 1655. They are addressed to 
Philippa, sister of Alice, and are only nine in number. 
It is their peculiar merit that within so small a space 
the full story of a woman's passion coming to its ma- 



turity should find expression, while giving incidentally 
a vivid account of life as it was lived in what was then 
a remote wilderness. Mrs. Cheney has done well with 
her archaisms in idiom and spelling, such exaggerations 
as they exhibit being essential to the atmosphere of 
the work. 

Among books of real delight, Mr. C. Hanford 
Henderson's "John Percyfield" (Houghton) deserves 
high place. It is one of the most charming of love- 
stories, and it is a great deal more. The hero stands as 
a type of the American gentleman, in all the dignity 
and grace of that fine old term, his ancestry being of 
Pennsylvania and New England stock; while the hero- 
ine represents a similar status of cultivation in Louisi- 
ana. They meet in Switzerland, at a, pension filled with 
the spirit of romance. But the pretty story of the love 
of Margaret and John forms but a small part of the 
book. In it may be found the reflections of the hero 
on all sorts of subjects, politics and economics most of 
all. Mr. Henderson, like many another modern Amer- 
ican writer, has not hesitated in using the virile and 
pregnant phrases in our spoken language which have 
not yet found full literary acceptance. 

Miss Una L. Silberrad has given her readers a man 
of complete engrossment in chemistry as the hero of 
"The Success of Mark Wyngate" (Doubleday). So 
complete is this engrossment that there will be a ten- 
dency throughout the book to quarrel with him for 
his density in affairs of the heart. By way of conclu- 
sion, Mark Wyngate attains commercial prosperity, but 
at a fearful and tragic cost. The book as a whole is 
original — " novel " seems to be taking on its older 
meaning in recent writing, — and it presents a series 
of strange pictures of modern life. The sombre under- 
current of the work is relieved by many touches of 
humor, leaving the impression of an art well controlled. 
Since the removal of various disabling acts, the 
Roman Catholics of England are playing a larger and 
larger part in British fiction, as in the national life. 
In "The Light Behind" (John Lane), Mrs. Wilfrid 
Ward has drawn a strong picture of social and political 
life, her protagonist being a woman most unhappily 
wedded to a dissolute nobleman, but strong enough to 
live a life of active good in spite of her lord's wicked- 
ness. Unloved as she is, she centres her interests in 
the advancement of a young Catholic writer, to whom 
her charm as a woman of the world makes an appeal 
too strong for his powers of resistance. He stands 
ready to give up faith, his brilliantly promising future, 
and life itself; but a fate merciful to them both takes 
her away at the psychological moment. The book 
abounds in well-drawn characterizations of the govern- 
ing class in many ramifications, and is enlightening in 
more respects than one. 

Detective stories are usually favorites for summer 
reading, but the number of them that have been based 
on murder mysteries make a story of counterfeiting, 
such as Mr. Will M. Clemens has written in " The 
Gilded Lady " (Dillingham), rather tame by comparison. 
The story is of the United States Secret Service. It 
begins with an attempt on the part of the narrator, a 
member of the force, to ascertain the facts about a 
privately-owned steam yacht. After a little it is dis- 
covered that the owners are engaged in the criminal 
occupation of making silver dollars of real silver and 
somewhat more valuable intrinsically than the author- 
ized coin. At one point in the story it is argued that 
the advocates of the ratio of 16 to 1 are really placing

the country in the hands of such counterfeiters, though 
the conspirators are making millions out of the existing 
system. The book concludes with a tirade against the 
modern metropolitan newspaper, rather too fierce to be 
convincing, and rather out of keeping in a book appa- 
rently intended to amuse. 

Mrs. Nancy Huston Banks has written a second 
novel, " Round Anvil Rock " (Macmillan), more of an 
historical romance than her previous story, but with 
a surer and more varied art. This, too, is a story of 
Kentucky, but of a Kentucky at the beginning of the 
fourth decade of the last century, when there was but 
one house of two stories in the commonwealth, and that 
built of cedar logs. It is rather authentic history 
turned into romance than romance pure and simple, 
and many historical characters, — General Jackson, Jo 
Daviess, Peter Cartwright, and others, among them — 
will be found described and characterized. The effect 
of the book will be to heighten Mrs. Banks's literary 
reputation. 

Dane Kempton, a poet and man of letters happily 
married and living in London, and Herbert Wace, a 
sociologist studying for his doctor's degree at the Uni- 
versity of California and affianced to a young woman 
graduate, discuss the question of love in an anonymous 
book bearing the title of " The Kempton- Wace Letters " 
(Macmillan). It is apparent, of course, that it would 
be difficult to find points of view more completely antip- 
odal than those occupied by men of such pursuits and 
training. To the poet, love has in it "the awfulness 
and splendour of God," to the other it is something 
susceptible of analysis in all its bearings, a companion- 
ship for purposes of work, its roots founded on the cry 
of the race for perpetuation. How right Kempton is, 
and bow wrong Wace, the last two letters in the vol- 
ume, from Hester, Wace's affianced wife, to her over- 
intellectualized lover, abundantly indicate; and there 
will be few readers of the book to dispute her verdict. 
The debate is an unusual and profitable one, interesting 
from beginning to end, and full of sound philosophy 
and right reasoning. 

In Miss Frances Charles, now that a second novel 
from her hand permits comparison, America has found 
a writer still in the flush of youth, with marked powers 
of discrimination and characterization and a downright 
genius for analysis. " The Siege of Youth " (Little, 
Brown & Co.) is a story of three men and three women 
in San Francisco, and of the working out of three sev- 
eral romances, each along lines quite distinctive. In 
the six protagonists of the narrative there is a mixture 
of races such as this country alone can show, and the 
interplay of temperament has its place in their develop- 
ment. There is a knowledge of life truly profound, 
and, above everything else, a close portrayal of the true 
Bohemia — that land worshipped so by those who can 
never hope to touch its shores because the bark of re- 
spectability that bears them is of too heavy a draught. 
A little method Miss Charles has adopted, of sketching 
her story before giving it in detail, is in her hands a 
means of grace and strength. 

International romances are being written quite as 
much on the other side of the Atlantic as on this, in 
convincing proof of the Anglo-Saxon entente cordiale. 
Katherine Tynan (Mrs. Hinkson), with " A Red, Red 
Rose " (Lippincott), is the last to add to their number. 
A brother and sister, orphaned children of a wealthy 
American manufacturer, buy an estate from an old En- 
glish family, of which the sole survivors are a fathe^ 



impoverished by youthful excesses at the gambling- 
table, and his sadly disappointed son. An Irish rector 
in the neighborhood has a lovely daughter; two dukes 
near-by have, respectively, a brother and a daughter; 
there is a young and wealthy widow close at hand; and 
after twenty-five chapters of getting them all adjusted 
the story closes in one more, appropriately called 
" Marrying and Giving in Marriage." 

A collection of short stories by Mr. George Moore 
can hardly fail to be interesting, though the component 
members of " The Untitled Field " (Lippincott) are, 
with hardly an exception, written for a definite purpose, 
rather than as proofs of their author's undoubted art. 
The stories are, emphatically, stories of the Irish people. 
One doubts neither the author's means of information 
nor his entire good faith, and his readers will be forced 
into an agreement with him much against their will in 
many instances. The Roman Church, throughout the 
stories, takes the puritanical attitude which was observ- 
able in Mrs. Humphry Ward's " Helbeck of Bannis- 
dale," and the result is widely at variance with the 
aspect the Church presents in the United States. So 
far as the Celtic attitude toward art is concerned, Mr. 
Moore is the bearer of bad tidings, for there appears 
to be no real national response whatever to the revival 
in which he has been so forward. The book will be 
certain to provoke discussion, — it would hardly be 
Mr. Moore's if it did not. 

A collection of short stories, remarkably various in 
their themes and interests, have been collected from 
the magazines by Mr. Arthur Colton under the name 
of "Tioba, and Other Tales" (Holt). Some of them 
deal with city life, and these are the best; others find 
place in central New York; one is of the Civil War. 
The length of these tales is as varied as their contents, 
ranging from a mere conte to a novelette. Collectively, 
they leave a pleasant impression, but one which seems 
not to be fixed in any way, as if they were all tentative 
efforts rather than fully matured work. The stories 
are, in fact, too scattered over the literary possibilities 
to argue more than an undeveloped sense of power. 

Mr. Guy Wetmore Carryl, heretofore known only as 
a purveyor of merry tales in rhyme, grows desperately 
serious in " The Lieutenant-Governor " (Houghton), 
and exhibits a knowledge of the labor movement and 
labor contentions in no way an advance upon the views 
in Charles Reade's " Put Yourself in His Place," the 
work of an aristocratically inclined Englishman a long 
thirty-three years ago. Reactionary sentiment of this 
sort is the more curiously belated because of the real 
intelligence shown in the premises by a score of other 
novelists recently. Here, everyone in sympathy with 
labor is a man devoid of principle, respect for law, and 
common-sense; all the sympathizers with capital, on the 
other hand, are not merely rich and well placed, but 
have a monopoly of the virtues as well, whether these 
be individual, social, or civic. The story is short, well 
written, and well put together. But it is woefully be- 
hind the times, and entirely unconvincing to those who 
do not think with their prejudices. 

" Josiah Flynt" reveals anew his wonderful grasp of 
the life led by actual — as distinguished from fictional 
— criminals, in " The Rise of Ruderick Clowd " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). The thief, burglar, and all-around crim- 
inal whose deeds the work recounts, is real, and as un- 
like the customary criminal of literary commerce as can 
well be imagined. Much of the consummate vulgarity 
of his life is necessarily concealed in its detail, though

it is suggested to those who know, and must color the 
story in the direction of the verities to those who do 
not. Indeed, the most daring parts of it are those deal- 
ing with Roderick's relations with womankind. Not 
many of the man's innumerable crimes are set forth with 
any particularity, Mr. Flynt wisely selecting a few 
typical cases and permitting these to stand for the rest. 
The intention is to describe a career of crime in its en- 
tirety, beginning with the nameless boy who steals first 
to help his mother, and carrying him through the re- 
form school and penitentiary to an old age of sufficient 
respectability, but still untouched by regret or remorse.

THIS IS THE DAY OF 
SCHOOL LIBRARIES 



Every school in the country, whether large or small, should be provided with the beginnings, 
at least, of a good school library. The prevailing low prices place suitable books within reach of 
all : and never before have books so well adapted to the purpose been provided, and in such numbers 

as at the present time.

Books 



Beginning with Eggleston's Stories of Great Americans for Little Americans, for Second 
Reader pupils, we have a wide range of books most valuable as a means of character building 
in the young, and desirable also for the store of information contained in them. 

These to be valuable must be written by persons who travel and who are able to erpress 
themselves in pure, clear English demanded at the present day. Carpenter's North America, South 
America. Asia, and Europe are such books. Other geographical aids will be found in our list 

These must be popular without being unscientific. They should be attractive as well. Dana's 
Plants and their Children. Herrick's Chapters on Plant Life and The Earth in Past Ages, Holder's 
Stories of Animal Life, Bartletts Animals at Home, and many other excellent books of ours are 
especially desirable in this line. 

Frank R. Stockton's Stories of New Jersey, Joel Chandler Harris' Stories of Georgia, Maurice 
Thompson's Stories of Indiana, Musiek's Stories of Missouri, William Dean Howells' Stories of 
Ohio, are all of national interest, and belong to representative literature. The Story of China, The 
Story of Japan, Guerber's Story of the English, of the Greeks, of the Romans, of the Thirteen 
Colonies, and of the Great Republic, Clark's Story of Troy, of Aeneas, and of Ulysses, and other 
new books of history and folklore for young readers are all desirable. 

The Eclectic Series of English Classics, Rolfe's Series of Shakespeare's plays (40 volumes), the 
Literature Primers, and various standard histories of English literature are valuable both for gen- 
eral reading and for special study. 

The Student's Series, including the Student's Hume, the Student's Gibbon, the Student's 
Strickland, etc. 

Special terms for School Library purposes will be quoted on these -md other similar books from 
our catalogue. Your correspondence is solicited.

(Local, State, and National) 

Gordy's American Leaders and Heroes 
Gordy' s History of the United States 
Ashton's Plane and Spherical Trigonometry 
Miller's Elementary Physics 

A Sufficient Reason in One Sentence 

Qordy's Language Lessons are the simplest, straightest paths to writing, speaking, and knowing 
our English Language. 

Burt's The Literary Primer is based upon word-getting, teaching of sounds, repetition of vocab- 
ulary, child's own activities, and contact with permanent literature. 

James's Government in State and Nation brings pupils face to face with government AS IT 
REALLY OPERATES and conditions as they really exist. 

James and Sanford's Our Government is just as good for elementary classes (either first year 
of High School or last year of Grammar School) as the larger book is for more advanced 
students. 

[Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania Supplements are in preparation.] 

Gordy's American Leaders and Heroes makes the personal character of our great men stand 
out clear as crystal in an epoch or crisis, and the beginning child learns that history is the 
record of human life. 

Gordy's History of the United States was written by a GRAMMAR SCHOOL MASTER, 
and that is a great distinction nowadays. 

Ashton's Trigonometry moves in a direct line to the solution of triangles. 

Miller's Elementary Physics is elementary, and the experiments ARE the bases of the text.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE HOSSFELD 



SERIES 

Some are severe, others are easy. 



One 



There are many theories as to the best method of learning a foreign language 
thing is certain, unless the method be interesting to the student it is profitless. 

The Hossfeld Series is probably as successful in its aim " to strike the happy mean " as an educational series can be. It 
neither promises accomplishment without effort nor does it expect drudgery of its students. 

The Hossfeld Series is planned to lead the student by increasing interest from step to step in the mastery of languages, 
keeping in sight all the various points of interest in language-study — the fascination of pronunciation, of suggestive construct- 
ion and phrasing, of telling idiom. 

The Hossfeld Series is of equal value to those studying the written and the spoken language.

BOOKS OF INTEREST AND UTILITY 

Edited by SHERWIN CODY 
A Selection from 

THE BEST ENGLISH ESSAYS 

Illustrative of the History of English Prose Style. With Historical and Critical Introduction by the Editor. 
The student of English prose style, whether he wishes to write prose himself, or to learn its elements, 
that he may judge the style of current writers, will find this a most suggestive and enlightening book. The 
general introduction defines and analyzes the essential elements of artistic prose, and the introductions to the 
different essayists point out the really important characteristic of each style. The selection, too, is fortunate 
in giving examples of ten great styles, all different and individual, which the student of English is invited to 
study and imitate. 

" By reading such a book, with its intelligent historical and critical comments, it is possible for the average reader to get an 
idea of the English essav that cannot be secured elsewhere." — Indianapolis Sentinel. 

•■ His choice, both of writers and their works, may be heartily commended." — 'Boston Transcript. 

" He has written for the book a preface that is a gem." — The Argonaut. 

A Selection from 

THE WORLD'S GREATEST SHORT STORIES

Nothing just like it has ever been available, and students of literature have been quick to recognize 
this fact. This volume is far more than a collection of short tales that may as conveniently be read elsewhere, 
as the series of fourteen introductions to the various stories constitute the only comprehensive history of short 
storv writing as an art ever published. 

In form and shape these books are especially convenient, being printed on thin Bible paper, so that in 
spite of their extensive contents they are scarcely three-quarters of an inch thick. 

18mo. Price, $1.00 net; delivered, $1.06. 

IN PREPARATION 

THE BEST TALES OF EDGAR ALLAN POE 
THE BEST POEMS AND ESSAYS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE 

The publishers believe that these two volumes, especially the second one, offer the most original and 
striking study of Poe's art and personality ever printed. Even old students of Poe will be surprised to find 
in the new arrangement of Poe's criticism a detailed analysis of the general principles of novel-writing and 
short -story writing, as well as the better known essays on poetry and examples of criticism of poetry, with his 
many pithy remarks on life and literature gathered from his journalistic book reviews. 

The books will be of the same handy form and size as the " Short Stories ** and " Best Essays."

Kellogg's First Lessons in Zoology. By Prof. Versox L. Kellogg, of Leland Stanford University. With 
over 250 illustrations. 303 pp., 12mo. {Ready this month.) 
Xot an abridgment of the author's Elements of Ztiology, but an entirely independent work adapted for high schools which do not undertake 
dissections. It is based on observation of animal life and external structure. No detailed study of internal anatomy is called for and no " laboratory" 
other than the schoolroom is required. Animal activities and life history receive the emphasis. Structure is considered in connection with the 
use of part*. The elements of animal physiology are so treated as to afford a rational basis for the study of human physiology. 
«*« Of the author's ELEMENTS OF ZOOLOGY (4S4 pp., $1.20 net). Prof. E. A. Andrews, of Johns Hopkins, wrote : "I judge it to be one of 
the very Jew gotd lei'- book* in Zoology yet produced." 

Noyes's Organic Chemistry. By Prof. Wm. A. Notes, of the Rose Polytechnic Institute. 534 pp.. 12mo, 
$1.50 net. 
Its most radical departure in method consists in the dropping of the division into "fatty " and " aromatic " compounds and in the adoption 

of what appears to the author a more fundamental and logical classification. 

Pro/. James L. Hove, Washington and Lee University : " It is excellent. I shall, in all probability, use it with my class next year." 

Pro/. P. y. Evans, Purdue University : " An excellent work. His discarding the conventional division into fatty and aromatic substances 

has much to recommend it." 

Cohen's Physical Chemistry. For Physicians and Biologists. Translated by Dr. Marttx H. Fischer of the 
L'niversity of California. 343 pp., $1.75 net. 

This volume attempts to give the results that have thus far been obtained by an application of physical chemistry to the biological sciences. 

Pro/. L. F. Barker, Unite' ri'y o/ Chicago: "It is undoubtedly the best book on the subject for medical students and physicians which has 
yet appeared in English. I wish that every medical student could read it and understand it." 

Pro/. H. S. Jennings, University o/ Michigan : " I think it is an excellent thing and that Dr. Fischer has done us a good turn in putting it 
into English. I shall recommend it to members of my class in General Physiology." 

Peirce's Plant Physiology. By Prof. George J. Peirce. of Leland Stanford University. 291 pp., 8vo. $2.00 net. 

A modern and thoroughly scientific discussion of the general principles of plant physiology, intended for the student or general reader 
acquainted with the elements of botany. 

Waters' Ferns A Manual for the Northeastern States) by C. K Waters. Ph.D. (Johns Hopkinsl. With an Analytical 
Key based on the Stalks. With over 200 illustrations from original drawings and photographs. 362 pp. Square 
Svo. {Ready in August.) 
A popular but thoroughly scientific book, covering all the ferns in the region covered by Britton's Manual. 

The Plant World says : "This book is likely to prove the leading popular work on ferns. The majority of the illustrations are from original 
photographs ; in respect to this feature It can be confidently asserted that no finer examples of fern photography have ever been produced.

Fournier's Napoleon. Translated under the editorship of Prof. EdwardG. Bourxe, of Yale. About 760 pp.. 12mo. 
{Ready in September.) 
Since its original publication this work has baen generally recognized as the best life of Napoleon in moderate compass. While not primarily 
designed as a text-book, Fournier's Napoleon gives so good an account of the political history of the period of the Revolution and of the Empire 
that it will prove a very convenient and serviceable manual for college courses on modern European history. 

Scott's Money and Banking. By Prof. W. A. SCOTT, of the University of Wisconsin. 3S1 pp., 8vo. $2.00 net. 

A plain, straightforward account of the nature and functions not only of money in the stricter sense, but also of the other mediums of 
exchange, which modern banking methods have elaborated. 

Pro/. Allyn A. Young, o/ Adelbert College.— There has been great need of a book on these subjects adapted to the use of college classes. 
Prof. Scott's work seems to supply the want admirably. 

New York Commercial Advertiser: — A serviceable text-book. . . . Controversial points are presented with impartial fullness on both sides 
. . . The style is simple and lucid and the chapters on banking are notably complete and satisfactory. 

Bemont & Monod's The Middle Ages in Europe. (395 to 1270.) Translated under the editorship of Prof. 
George B. Adams, of Yale. 556 pp., 12mo. $1.60 net. 

The original work has come to be well-nigh universally regarded as the standard account of the period. 

Pro/. George L. Burr, o/ Cornell : The book of Bemont and Monod I have long regarded as the very best text-book known to me in its field. 
Pro/. Dana C. Munro, o/ the University o/ Wisconsin : I am very glad to see the translation. This is one of the best books we have ever 
had for Mediaeval history.

THE ED UCA TIO N OF S CHOOL BOARDS. 

Teaching children is by no means the most 
difficult part of the educational processes of to- 
day. Traditional home and public sentiment 
pushes them toward docility. To educate the 
men who elect the teachers, who pass upon 
what shall be taught, who decide how much 
one may have to teach with, who are, fre- 
quently in practice and always in law, the 
head of the whole school system, and who not 
uncommonly regard any suggestion of their 
need of instruction as an impertinence, — all 
this is no child's play. 

One of our most successful trainers of school 
boards, Mr. A. P. Blodgett of Syracuse, says it 
takes practically about two years properly to 
educate an average board member. This will 
seem to others who have had experience a 
compliment to the class of men who serve the 
schools of Syracuse, and to Mr. Blodgett him- 
self, more than a sober statement of fact. It 
has taken over a hundred years to bring Amer- 
ican school boards to their present state of 
culture, and few have graduated summa cum 
laude. 

The fact is that this part of the educational 
system has been woefully neglected. Among 
our colleges for every kind of training, there 
is yet no institution for the education of school- 
boards ; there are no examinations for this 
position, no certificates of fitness, no course of 
study. It is time that some up-to-date pub- 
lisher put upon the market a text-book on 
" How to be a School Trustee." Were I able 
to carry out such movements as produced " The 
Committee of Ten," " The Committee of Fif- 
teen," and other working organizations of ex- 
perts, I would secure such a report from the 
united efforts of Mr. Eliot, Mr. Harper, Mr. 
Greenwood, Mr. Blodgett, Mr. Andrews, Mr. 
Maxwell, Mr. Cooley, Mr. Bright, Mr. Lane, 
and Mr. Jones. Everyone recognizes the need 
of such instruction. It should be given in ac- 
cordance with the best methods of teaching. 
Some of the subjects of the various chapters 
are obviously suggested. For instance: The 
schools are for the children. Any board that 
does not recognize as the chief root and centre 
of its every act the eternal welfare of the chil- 



82 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



dren of the community has no right to exist- 
ence. Any member who does not stand upon 
such a platform should be removed at once 
from a position which he may unworthily oc- 
cupy but can never fill. Membership on a 
school board is not given to start a man in a 
political career. It is not for the purpose 
of caring for any particular ward or district. 
The schools are for the whole people. The 
children will take the effects of their good or 
poor schooling into all districts. The obvious 
purpose of the schools requires a board mem- 
ber to serve children and not men. 

It certainly is remarkable that, from our 
national Senate down, the tendency of repre- 
sentative bodies to discuss so seriously their 
own dignity is irresistible even to the delay 
and exclusion of the service for which they are 
elected. When I was in the Chicago schools, 
the most commonly expressed fear of speakers 
on the floor of the school-board was that they 
might " stultify " themselves. In the case of 
several resolutions which experiment proved 
were unworkable, the members agreed that 
the resolutions should not have been passed, 
but that they could not repeal them without 
"stultifying" the board. When a man first 
becomes a member, he is usually frank in 
avowing that he knows nothing about the 
schools or education ; but very soon he joins 
with the others in the belief that united board 
action transmutes ignorance into sagacity, and 
that the whole board is greater than the sum 
of its parts. You can get for a good measure 
the individual indorsement of each member, 
but you may fail to secure action by the board. 
Thus the whole is less than the sum of its parts. 
Good judges can predict how individuals will 
act. No one knows what a board of trustees 
will do. The supreme need is a policy of work- 
ing only for the welfare of the school children. 
With this there must come a system by which 
the board will have in its membership those 
who can test every proposition in this light. 

Good teaching depends chiefly upon the 
teacher. It is a curious commentary on edu- 
cational progress that most of the advancement 
in the raising of the standards of teaching has 
been made in the teeth of the opposition of 
boards of education. In my school-days, in a 
town distinguished throughout the West for 
its educational facilities, the girls who taught 
us were not required to know how to teach. 
They could work most of the examples in the 
arithmetic, but none of them could develop 
arithmetical skill, or any kind of skill, in their 



pupils. These girls were daughters or nieces 
of men who elected the board of education. 
To bring into those schools especially pre- 
pared teachers cost more than one superintend- 
ent his position. One of the chief features 
in a course of instruction to school boards 
should be the demonstration that everyone 
whose friends ask her appointment is not a 
teacher, and that a board of education selected 
as is now the custom is not a trustworthy 
judge of a good teacher. 

To insure the welfare of school children 
is a business requiring business-like methods. 
School boards are to judge and to legislate, 
not to make speeches before an audience, or be 
reported to an admiring constituency through 
the morning papers. There is no more reason 
why a trustee should make speeches at a meet- 
ing than there is call on a bank director to 
deliver an oration to his business asssociates. 
The better systems are gradually working to- 
ward the entire exclusion of speeches. The 
work is being done by small committees ; the 
school boards are being reduced to seven or 
nine members. In realizing the business nature 
of the work of trustees, we are coming back to 
the view of John Colet, who founded St. Paul's 
School in 1509. After he had built his school, 
says Erasmus, he entrusted the care of the 
property, not to priests, not to the bishop, not 
to the chapter, not to the great ministers of the 
court, but to the married laymen of the silk 
mercers' guild, men of uprightness and repute. 
And when he was asked why he made this dis- 
position of his property, he answered that there 
is no absolute certainty in human affairs, but 
that as far as his experience went he believed 
there was less corruption in such a body of 
merchants than in any other condition or order 
of men. 

The real work of school management must 
be done by experts. School boards, ever since 
I have known them, have claimed that there 
are no educational experts ; they have also done 
their share to prevent the development of such. 
No one knows of a school board that experi- 
ments in a class-room, or that studies instruc- 
tion in neighboring cities ; yet everyone knows 
of many school boards that pass upon the most 
vital questions of educational procedure. Some 
one comes before them and presents the reasons 
for a certain reform ; it is referred to the ap- 
propriate sub-committee. After some time, 
when the arguments have pretty well faded 
away, the thing is discussed in committee from 
the standpoint of the members' own school 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

experience, thirty or forty years ago. That set- 
tles it. The text-books and materials desired 
for aid to instruction are not uncommonly 
judged with utter disregard for the end in 
view. It is still rare for a board to say to a 
superintendent : devise the best course pos- 
sible, tell what you need in the way of space, 
apparatus, and books, to carry it out, and we 
will do the best we can for it. The more com- 
mon injunction is : here is a building, books 
and apparatus ; do the best you can with them. 
And yet here is the most complicated process 
in the world to carry out ; the development of 
the minds of children. Here are colleges all 
over the world, holding men year after year 
to study and compare and perfect methods of 
most effectively and economically equipping 
children with mental power. Too often the 
man skilled in these processes finds his main 
obstacle to their employment the very body 
that one would expect to be his chief assistant. 
The experts in engineering, in accounting, in 
law, in medicine, have won their positions. No 
one will win an educational expert's position 
for him but himself. He can't do it by talk. 
He must become more expert in the art of 
proof. The meetings of the school board is his 
natural field. 

You cannot get results if you keep chang- 
ing your teachers. School changes, except in 
the larger cities, are notoriously frequent all 
through the United States. The annual re- 
ports of State superintendents, when they come 
to record the placing of teachers from term to 
term, remind you of a rapid game of chess. 
The interests of our children are everywhere 
made subservient to the fun of a political 
contest. It amounts to nothing more. No 
■one cares much what the school policy of the 
-county superintendent is. He is nominated 
along with the regular ticket, and he is up or 
down with it. Rotation in office for a State 
superintendent for mere rotation's sake, is the 
rule in most of the States. Teachers are 
■elected by the year. They are birds of pas- 
sage. They cannot buy a home and cast their 
lot with the community, or make long plans 
for its welfare. This is one of the most ab- 
surd aspects of school board administration. 
In their fear of putting one or two lazy teachers 
where punishment would be a little more diffi- 
cult to administer, they deprive all the schools 
of that superb increase of efficiency which every 
worker gives when conscious of steady em- 
ployment. I wonder what Harvard, Michigan 
and Chicago Universities would be, were Presi- 



dents Eliot and Angell and Harper, and all 
the members of the faculties, suspended in the 
same uncertain attitudes in which school boards 
hold teachers. 

The superintendent of schools must have 
enough power to secure good teaching. The 
board must keep hands off what has been dele- 
gated to him. To give the head man authority 
seems such an obvious requirement of every 
organization, that the wonder is why board 
members so constantly violate it. Philadelphia 
leads in this policy of reducing the supervising 
and teaching force to proper humility. The 
most curious feature of it all is the strictness 
with which these men in their mercantile con- 
cerns will avoid hampering their superintend- 
ent in his selection of assistants, or in his dis- 
cipline of them. 

These are some of the lessons the school 
boards of America need learning. It is a very 
practical query as to who is going to teach 
them. One of the plainest duties of a super- 
intendent is to educate his trustees. If he 
doesn't speak freely and fully to his board on 
all phases of school administration, if he does 
not fearlessly tell things as they are with the 
design to improve them, he is himself an ob- 
stacle. But it is not necessary for him to go 
around with a chip on his shoulder, or to blow 
his trumpet in the tone of this essay of mine. 
A school fight is usually an act of folly. Di- 
plomacy is not so picturesque, but it goes far- 
ther. To convince the judgments of men, one 
must clear the way by winning their hearts. 
Malcontents who criticize their superiors, even 
though they speak undoubted truth, run the 
risk of a habit of carping which destroys effi- 
ciency. I have worked for school boards so 
long, and have known so many fine men in 
them, that to suggest even in an abstract man- 
ner, as here, some defects in the management 
of schools due to the American school-board 
system, seems something like swearing at one's 
grandmother. 

The pleasantest way to educate trustees is 
to entice them into the schools and to have 
them speak to children. There is a very subtle 
truth iuvolved in this. It is an actual return 
to first principles. Some writers have advo- 
cated the education of school boards by means 
of the school-board journal. There are also 
school-board associations for mutual advance- 
ment ; but the most powerful agent of all is 
the daily press. How the teachers have awak-

teaching keep in touch with their classmates 
who have gone into journalism, the cause of 
education gains a great ally. It is by this 
means, together with constantly improving 
work in the class-room, that the general public 
will be educated to demand the best schooling 
attainable. As school boards are usually in 
advance of the general public, there seems to 
be every reason to believe that the whole edu- 
cational system will continue by various jerks

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



SOME CHANGES IN GRADUATE STUDIES. 
( To the Editor of The Dial.) 

A quarter of a century ago, when Johns Hopkins 
University opened its doors, a new sort of scholastic 
work was introduced in America. Up to that time 
there had been no place in this country where graduate 
studies had been recognized as of primary importance. 
The colleges and universities had been concerned al- 
most exclusively with the undergraduate student, and 
while the old fashioned college course had been very 
materially liberalized it was still designed to meet the 
wants of the immature, to furnish a certain mental dis- 
cipline and a modicum of general culture. The new 
university had other and different ideals. It proposed 
to concern itself with those who had already received 
the training of a college course and attained to the dig- 
nity of a college degree. The hope of the directors of 
the new foundation was that the university would be- 
come a centre of research; that through the opportu- 
nities which it afforded, material additions should be 
made to the sum total of human knowledge; that it 
might become a school of research, as distinguished 
from a school of instruction. To this end, somewhat 
novel plans were followed in the organization of the 
new institution ; unusual sums were spent on equipment 
as distinguished from buildings; eminent men were 
called to the professorships at liberal salaries; and, 
most unusual of all, a system of fellowships was organ- 
ized, the incumbents being elected, not because of 
pecuniary need, but because of ability to carry on the 
actual work of investigation. Provision was made for 
the conferring of the degree of Ph.D. upon resident 
students upon their completion of a thesis embodying 
the results of some worthy piece of research work. 

The new school proved popular, and, almost from 
the first, as many students as could be properly ac- 
comodated were in attendance. Other and older uni- 
versities began to alter their courses and emphasize 
graduate work. Harvard, Yale, and Columbia, among 
others in the East, took it up. In the Middle West, 
Michigan, Wisconsin, and other State universities, in 
particular, followed. New schools were organized 
either with a view to encouragement of graduate work 
only, as in the case of Clark University, or proposing to 
make it very prominent, as in the case of Stanford and 
Chicago. To-day the opportunities for graduate work 
are widespread, and in any portion of the country the 
student who wishes more advanced work than even the 



modern college course offers finds the opportunity at 
his door. 

In the period since the opening of Johns Hopkins 
University, very considerable changes have taken place 
not only in the amount of graduate work done but in 
its character and in the attitude of the students and 
the schools toward it. But few years' experience was 
needed to demonstrate that the men who had taken 
graduate courses were better qualified for teaching and 
certain other professional positions than those who had 
not done so. As a result, it has quickly come about that 
the Ph.D. degree is almost a sine qua non for a college 
professorship anywhere in the country. For many posi- 
tions in the government service it is almost equally 
essential; and so, from being courses primarily designed 
to stimulate investigation, the graduate courses have 
become professional courses designed to fit men for 
particular positions, and quite comparable to medical 
and law courses. From being centres of research, our 
graduate schools are becoming schools for professional 
training. 

The American mind loves order and system, and 
above all it loves definite accomplishment. The Ph.D. 
degree, intended to be incidental to the accomplishment 
of research work, has become the end for which research 
work is in very many cases at least, undertaken. 

There have been many factors which have operated 
to bring this about. One was, undoubtedly, the need 
of better trained men, better informed men, in the po- 
sitions into which the new doctors of philosophy have 
gone. Another, and possibly the most important factor, 
lay in the circumstance that most graduate work was 
taken up at schools where undergraduate work was 
already important. Harvard, Yale, and all the older 
schools, were primarily colleges. Their traditions were 
all founded on this fact. The teachers were primarily 
concerned with the immature, uninformed under- 
graduates. The courses were designed to meet the 
wants of such students. Where professional schools 
existed, the relations of the new courses were, for 
various reasons, closer with the undergraduate work 
than with the professional. Where the instructor has 
developed his methods to meet the wants of under- 
graduates, he is apt to use essentially the same methods 
when teaching graduates. This is especially true when 
he has in his graduate courses one year the same men 
who were in his undergraduate courses the year before. 
In this manner it has come about that in a broad way 
the undergraduate courses have merely been lengthened, 
and an additional degree is granted. 

The graduate schools, instead of being places where 
men of maturity come together for wider reading and 
for research work, are becoming schools with increas- 
ingly fixed courses of study leading definitely to a 
degree, and, in turn, to a definite class of openings in 
life. Research is a means to an end, and is not the 
pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. An increasing 
number of young men and women upon attaining to 
the bachelor's degree, remain in residence and take 
up graduate work. Often they do so largely because 
nothing else appeals to them as a definite course of 
action, and college graduates are proverbially at a loss 
for an opening upon graduation. 

All this is a matter of fact. Whether or not it is 
also a matter of protest, is another question. Evidently 
the change brings with it both advantages and disad- 
vantages, — the former in the better filling of many 
important positions, the latter in a diminishing emphasis

TOO MUCH LITERARY "STUDY." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
"The teaching of literature has planted a terrible 
fixed foot in our schools," wrote Mr. Saintsbury recently, 
in his volume on Matthew Arnold. Mr. Saintsbury can 
afford to indulge in the luxury of convictions, and is 
given to emphatic affirmation, so that one wonders in 
what terms he would have chosen to express his opinion 
had the following item, in the course of study of one of 
our most progressive Eastern universities, chanced to 
meet his eye. 

English Literature. — English Letter -Writers. — Among the 
writers studied in Course 34 will be Howel, Cromwell, 
the Verneys, Swift. Pope. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, 
Walpole, Chesterfield, Franklin, Byron, Shelley, Mrs. 
Browning, Carlyle, Emerson, Thackeray, Lowell, Fitz- 
gerald and Stevenson. 

But, after all, one does not need to be a recognized 
authority, and therefore a chartered idol-breaker, to 
question the value of such study for undergraduates, — 
perhaps even the right of the university to offer it. 
And this suggests the whole matter of the propriety of 
taking up for classroom work, in secondary school or 
college, literature which has much of the personal 
element in it. A study of letter writing in itself is not 
likely to be objectionable when the letters are literature 
or history pure and simple, and are intended by the 
writers for such, or at least for something not very 
different. Many of the earlier writers mentioned in the 
foregoing list corresponded with a perfect knowledge 
— some of them in the hope — that their letters might 
become public property, and so are fair game for the 
professor. And in the days when " epistolary corre- 
spondence " was a serious matter, any letter was a dif- 
ferent thing from the careless unreserved talk between 
intimates we listen to when we read the letters of at 
least two of the authors whose names appear at the 
end of the list. " On n'est trahi que par les siens," and 
Stevenson and Thackeray are no doubt sincerely ad- 
mired by the earnest instructor who is analyzing their 
"methods" from his platform. A text-book on rhetoric, 
printed a few years since, was most enthusiastic over 
Thackeray's epistolary style, and recommended all 
students who were desirous of becoming graceful letter- 
writers to take the " Brookfield Letters" for their models. 
" Great honor to the fireflies, but ... !" 

Of course it is the inclusion of Thackeray among the 
letter-writers to be studied which causes us to wince most 
sharply. It is hard to think that to the most sensitive 
of men, — who did his best to escape biography, and 
who wrote to Charlotte Bronte, " If I thought you 
showed my letters to anyone, I would never write you 
another," — should come the fate of having the most 
intimate of the letters he wrote to the friend who 
helped him through his broken life studied, perhaps 
yawned over, perhaps worse, by successive groups of 
undergraduates. A score of passages will occur to 
Thackerayans — pages full of their author's dear non- 
sense, or brave melancholy, — which to think of as 
assigned for " required reading " is to shudder. In the 
case of Stevenson, to be sure, the sin is less indefensible, 
for the public was always more or less in his confidence 



after he had aroused its interest. Still we cannot 
but think that even he, philosopher as he was, would 
have shrunk from having the details of the " discontent 
and rapture and despair " of his youth thrust upon a 
set of lads, the sympathetic and the stolid alike. 

To all this it may be objected that such a course of 
study as this is never prescribed in any college, and so 
need be taken up by no student who is wholly out of 
touch with the writers discussed. But no one who has 
to do with undergraduates will need to be reminded how 
often they " elect " a course because it comes at a con- 
venient hour, or because there is a chance of its proving 
easier than an alternative. In a popular volume of 
Harvard stories we have a pleasing picture of a student 
in a fiction-course removing his troublesome uncertainty 
as to whether Jane Austen was a man or George Eliot 
a woman by memorizing the verses beginning, 

" Good heavens, good heavens ! Miss Mary Ann Evans, 
What made you change your name ? " 
and so on. Perhaps that is only amusing, and not too 
discouraging. There are some literary waters of which 
all may well be made to take at least a single draught. 
But when not merely the work, but the personality, of 
writers who at worst have done nothing to forfeit our 
respect is subjected to possibilities of much that the 
living men would have resented, it seems as if he were 
driving something of a hard bargain for the fame we 
grant our authors. 

The last decade or so has seen as provided with 
countless numbers of what Professor Dowden has 
lately characterized as " funicular railways to the 
summit of Parnassus"; and the incommunicable has 
been communicated, in more or less satisfactory fash- 
ion, by the simple process of applying the methods 
of chemistry or the physical sciences to the study of 
literature. But before we congratulate ourselves too 
unreservedly upon our progress, might it not be well 
to consider whether some few divisions of the field of 
literature ought not, from their very nature, to be 
regarded as exempt from the incursions of at least the 
reluctant among the " personally conducted " ?

THE LITERARY METHOD OF TEACHING 

ENGLISH. 

(To the Editor of Tint Dial. 

Every profession has its jargon. For example, with 
what pride does the business man often produce the 
crabbed, ungrammatical, unintelligible paragraph which 
he calls a " professional business letter " ! And teachers 
have their professional jargon, too. It is the jargon of 
the classroom, and has such a hold on the average 
teacher that it is seldom that any teacher can write a 
readable paragraph for a newspaper or magazine. 

Now nothing special is gained, either by the business 
man or the teacber, in using his or her professional 
jargon, when we have a simple, universal language, 
capable of the most varied expression, and intelligible 
to everybody. 

In the case of the jargon of the classroom, much 
actual harm is done, for the simple reason that the 
average pupil is not going to be a pedagogue and has 
no use for pedagogical phrases. He really needs sim- 
ple, plain, natural English, such as the skilled literary 
artist uses in writing for common readers. 

One most disastrous outgrowth of the pedagogical 



THE DIAL 



[Aug. 16, 



jargon is the method of trying to teach language by 
meaningless groups of words. Spelling is taught by 
dead lists of words in spellers; grammar by dead sen- 
tences; composition by dead illustrative paragraphs. A 
really interesting connected story can seldom be found 
in any book on English. Yet words mean nothing ex- 
cept as they are used to express ideas (real ideas, not 
fragments). The only object in studying language is 
to become able to express ideas; and apart from ideas 
language is the merest machinery. 

The literary method of teaching English requires, 
first of all, that the teacher shall possess some skill in 
literary expression. We need a school of English in 
which the professors shall be real men of letters, the 
whole atmosphere of which shall be literary, and which 
shall afford the professional teacher of English a pro- 
fessional literary training preparatory to his work. 
Our teachers of English should be trained side by side 
with those who are preparing to become writers of 
English. A person without literary skill should not be 
accepted by any school as a teacher of English. 

Then, when the teacher comes to the classroom, he 
will discard all the rubbishy spelling-books with life- 
less lists of words, all the grammars with lifeless col- 
lections of illustrative sentences, all the rhetorics filled 
with rules and directions in lumbering language (for 
very few rhetorics are decently written). Then he will 
teach spelling by drilling the pupil upon some of the 
fundamental principles of the language, which abso- 
lutely determine the spelling of ninety-nine per cent of 
the 300,000 words of which English boasts; those most 
troublesome words called homonyms will be studied only 
in connection with their meaning (that is, their actual 
use for the expression of ideas) ; while the three or four 
thousand common irregular words remaining will be 
memorized by a rational memory system, which classi- 
fies and gives all the mnemonic aid possible. 

Grammar will be simplified into a practicable little 
machine which the student may master as a carpenter 
masters the use of his hammer or his saw or his square, 
so that it may be used to test the correctness of the 
arrangement of words in sentences. It will be found 
that English grammar is almost wholly a matter of 
word-logic, and that the successful teaching of gram- 
mar consists in cultivating the habit of following the 
logical relationships of words in sentences. This logic 
cannot possibly become apparent except in a complete 
and perfectly logical composition. 

Composition will be taught according to the method 
used by Franklin, Stevenson, Maupassant, and all the 
greatest producers of finished literature, — that is, by 
setting the pupil to imitate simple masterpieces till 
he catches the knack of producing something of the 
same sort. All the rules of rhetoric should be offered 
as concrete essays by real masters, which the student 
will be asked to study and re-write until he learns the 
art of doing it, regardless of whether he can name the 
thing or not. 

This, in brief, is the " method of the masters " — the 
sort of school in which real masters of English have 
learned their art. The first step toward realizing it 
will be to banish all the meaningless lists of words, the 
collections of meaningless detached sentences and para- 
graphs, and substitute the simple, beautiful, interesting, 
and perfectly logical compositions of the great masters 
of English prose. Sherwin Cody.

Some Ideals of Saintly Life.* 



Did it ever occur to the Reverend John 
Bampton, Prebend of Minor Pars Altaris in the 
Cathedral Church of Salisbury from 1718 to 
his death in 1751, that the series of annual 
lectures which he founded might not all be of 
inestimable worth ? Did it ever cross his mind 
that though the Heads of Colleges in the Uni- 
versity of Oxford, "and no others," should 
duly assemble on the first Tuesday of Easter 
term "in the room adjoining the Printing 
House between the hours of ten in the morning 
and two in the afternoon," their choice of a 
Bampton Lecturer might not always rest upon 
the right head? Did any uneasy suspicion 
tease his imagination that even a fellow, tutor, 
and precentor of his college, and a bishop's 
examining chaplain to boot, might test candi- 
dates, and lead choirs, and instruct under- 
graduates, and be an active member of a col- 
lege corporation, yet still lack the divine "art 
of putting things," without which in the pulpit 
of S. Mary's his acquirements in music, in 
letters, in theology, and in administration, 
would be all in vain? If such forebodings ever 
haunted him he doubtless brushed them aside 
as idle ; for he made no provision against them. 

The Bampton Lectures have a just fame. 
Yet the student of all the volumes which, by 
the founder's will, must be printed within two 
months of the delivery of the " eight Sermon- 
Lectures," discovers with a sad surprise that 
for the publication of some of them the world 
could have endured to wait for two decades or 
two centuries without serious impoverishment. 
Certainly the volume for the year 1903 makes 
no epoch. It is not precisely of the fibre of 
Hampden or Hatch, of Mosely or Liddon. It is 
some years since any lecturer in the long succes- 
sion has deeply impressed the English Church 
or the Christian public. Can it be that the 
heads of colleges exercise less discrimination in 
their choice, or that the English Church pro- 
duces strong divines less frequently, than of 
old ? In the instance of the volume before us, 
the author seeks to disarm criticism by the 
pleas of haste, over-occupation, and illness. 
Undoubtedly influenza is not an illuminating

or inspiring influence. John Bainpton failed to 
foresee its prevalence, or his insistence upon 
printing within two months had been made less 
stringent. The author may be forgiven ; the 
book remains for impartial criticism to deal 
with. 

It must be said, then, that this is not a bril- 
liant or incisive piece of work. If one is look- 
ing for clearly conceived or closely reasoned 
notions of what Christianity has done or can 
do for national life, of how the lives of good 
men and the legends that drape them affect 
the general conscience and conduct of their 
contemporaries or their successors, he will do 
well to look elsewhere. There is an awkward- 
ness about the very title-page which suggests 
that the author had no strong grasp of his sub- 
ject, that he had taken it at haphazard, had 
never grappled with any central or dominating 
idea, but had thrown out tentative lines in 
sundry directions, hoping that stray thoughts 
might take the hook and be drawn in. The 
discussion goes on in a rambling, desultory 
fashion, as if the theme had casually occurred 
to the writer in the process of writing, and 
the materials had arranged themselves as they 
drifted past. As we lay the book down, we are 
not sure that we can put a finger on any pal- 
pable results of the more or less heroic ven- 
tures of S. Adalbert, S. Elizabeth, or S. Louis. 
That they were effective in their own day, need 
not be doubted. But who can be sure that 
what they did, or what the chroniclers say they 
did, has vitally affected the fortunes and char- 
acter of Prussia, of Hungary, of France? It 
is fatally possible to recognize and do homage 
to saints, and to build chapels and churches 
in their memory, while in no way sharing their 
spirit or following where they lead. 

Mr. Hutton opens his course by saying that 
the Kingdom of God in each successive period 
depends upon how that period interprets for 
itself the Christian ideal, and how it embodies 
its ideal in human living. Each age freshly 
translates the Gospel into its own vernacular, 
and illuminates the translation with saintly 
lives. As the original colors grow dim, mellow 
legends take their place. What was at first a 
blot blooms out into a halo. The legend, false 
to the facts, transfigures the spirit of the life. 
The miracle of a Christly personality sweeps 
along with it a train of lesser marvels invented 
or magnified by the popular imagination. In 
the first fervor of the New Testament period, 
all believers are assumed to be saints. As 
time goes on, the term seems better reserved 



for those of rare and peculiar eminence in 
holiness. " The Deacon is a good man," we 
say, " but no saint." The saints, then, in com- 
mon usage, are those heroes of faith in whom 
the mood and energy of Christian character 
have been most splendidly revealed. They are 
" single thoughts of God manifested in endless 
variety." 

Of course there have been many such "sin- 
gle thoughts " which have passed unrecognized, 
saints uncanonized who in the truest Apostolical 
Succession have transmitted from age to age 
their pattern of godlikeness. The earliest 
saints were canonized by popular acclaim. 
The multitude felt the touch and thrill, dis- 
cerned the virtue that went forth from certain 
of their kind and spontaneously declared them 
to be of the holy fellowship. Perhaps they 
stoned them living, but they enshrined them 
dead. Later, the Church authorities, bishops or 
councils, set their seal of approval upon such 
instinctive tribute, as in the Eastern church 
to-day. Not until after the twelfth century 
did the Popes in the Western church succeed 
in reserving this power to themselves. Even 
so late as the fifteenth century, in the case of 
S. Osmund of Canterbury, all that remained 
for Nicholas V. to do was to affix his official 
sanction to the anticipative act of the people. 
There were " ears to the ground " in those days 
as well as in ours, and very sensitive ears. 

It is interesting to be reminded that in the 
matter of national saints, those recognized and 
accepted by a whole race or people, the legends 
sometimes depict as their typical characteristics 
excellences in which the best and wisest spirits 
of the time hold their fellows to be conspicu- 
ously deficient, thus spurring them to strain 
after ideals at present far above them ; while, 
on the other hand, in other times and places, 
the legends but discern and disclose in their 
full beauty and glory virtues already inherent 
in the national character, thus producing, as it 
were, a composite photograph of the nobler 
qualities of the people. Thus, the Slavic Saints 
Vladimir the Great and Alexander Nevski dis- 
play the purity, the placidity, the generosity, 
the self-sacrifice of Russian character. Thus, 
Joan of Arc, a being unique in Christendom, 
at once simple child and soldierly genius, em- 
bodies the chivalry and religion, " the military 
and Catholic and racial aspirations of mediaeval 
France." So, " out of the mass of local Ger- 
man saints emerge the two great names, simple 
and heroic " of S. Boniface in the eighth cen- 
tury and S. Elizabeth in the thirteenth. So

Spain has S. Fernando the Christian knight, 
the Crusader, and S. John of the Cross, ex- 
treme ascetic yet genuine reformer, men austere 
and even harsh, absorbed in a world beyond mor- 
tal sight, and S. Teresa, gay, witty, natural, her 
religion a romance, delighting in sacrifice, and 
serving her God with a gladsome heart. So 
Portugal enshrines S. John of God, " shepherd, 
soldier, servant, chained slave, a peddler of 
pious books, tortured as a lunatic, a beggar 
that he might support and nurse the poor, a 
preacher of conversion, a skilled physician of 
the soul, his life a life of active beneficence," 
and also S. Francis Xavier, the great mission- 
ary, embodying his people's M splendid spirit 
of adventure, their determination and reckless- 
ness, their subordination of immediate to far- 
distant fame." 

The exception proves the rule, when we are 
told that the endless divisions of Italy in me- 
diaeval and modern — all but recent — times 
have forbidden her any distinctively national 
saints, S. Catharine of Siena and her name- 
sake of Genoa and S. Francis being treasures 
rather of the Church at large. Of the three, 
the last-named comes nearest to the position 
of patron-saint of the whole peninsula, the 
Fioretti being familiar and dear to the children, 
the most popular of literature throughout the 
land, fit indeed to be styled " the Breviary of 
the Italian people." It is happy to know that 
in the instance of S. Francis the reality sus- 
tains or surpasses the legend. " The main out- 
lines are quite clear, quite historic. About the 
character itself there is no doubt. It is the 
details here and there that have been touched, 
the strange visions that have been amplified." 

These are all historic persons, however legend 
may have used her gold thread to embroider 
and stiffen the choice stuff of reality. But 
what of St. George of England? Must we 
part with him ? No, we may be satisfied that 
though Gibbon managed to confuse him with 
an infamous contractor of Cappadocia, later 
students have established the existence of a 
George, also of Cappadocia, in the fourth cen- 
tury, whose stout battling with the serried 
evils of his time was typified after the Apoca- 
lyptic precedent by a fight with a dragon, until 
through the loving touches of poet and sculptor 
and painter arose the bright ideal of dragon- 
slayer, deliverer of a royal princess, earlier 
Bayard, fearless and stainless, who eight cen- 
turies afterwards was to be taken into the 
Anglican Kalendar and become the patron 
saint of England. Better such a legend, if only 



legend it were, than the sand-heaps of much 
bald and barren history. 

So much has Mr. Hutton to say of Saints 
in general and national saints in particular. 
In the other lectures, the saints of the English 
Conversion, the royal saints, the monks and 
hermits, the statesmen saints, and the saintly 
women and children, are somewhat loosely 
classed and dealt with. It is a Scotch haggis 
with " a deal of fine confused feeding," excel- 
lent material not very well handled. There is 
a valuable appendix, in which for the first time, 
from a manuscript in King's College, Oxford, 
is printed the Passio et Miracula Sancti 
Eadwardi Regis et Martiris. In another 
appendix, upon English mediaeval miracles, 
the writer of the twentieth century is some- 
what at odds with the traditional churchmen ; 
nor is it easy to predict the issue. The author 
sees that the question is partly one of evidence 
and partly one of a general attitude of mind 
towards the miraculous at large. He agrees 
with Dr. Sanday that " of the results of ' the 
contact of personalities filled with the Spirit of 
God with the conditions of the outer world ' 
we have still very much, one is tempted to say 
almost everything, to learn." That safe con- 
clusion does not, however, carry us very far. 

It is to be said that the book is well printed and 
well bound, and that there is a sufficient index. 
Of the remarkable tribute to Charles the First, 
pp. 337-353, perhaps the less said the better. 
Not the goldenest of legends can rehabilitate 
that " Saint " forevermore.

Publications of the University of 
Chicago.* 



The founder of the University of Chicago 
intended it to be an institution of higher edu- 
cation. It was to be primarily a school for 
graduate students. Its professors were to be 
not merely teachers, but investigators. They 
were to extend the bounds of human knowledge 
by original research, and the results of their 
studies and experiments were to be published 
from time to time in books and pamphlets. A 
part of their vocation was to train advanced 
students in the use of the scientific method, to 
make specialists of young men and women 
whose writings would be substantial contribu-

tions to the literature of the subject that they 
undertook to investigate. 

The University of Chicago has had as a 
definite purpose or policy the development of 
an aptitude for investigative work. The uni- 
versity man of to-day is expected to find new 
truth, and to re-state old truth from the point 
of view of the present. He is to explore 
thoroughly some corner of a subject, and, if 
possible, throw fresh light on it. He must 
also cultivate the critical spirit. A part of his 
mission is to correct errors. In the library 
and the laboratory, instructors and students 
-are to seek and find new knowledge. As Pres- 
ident Harper has said, the province of a univer- 
sity is to be " the centre of thought on every 
problem connected with human life and work, 
and the first obligation resting upon the indi- 
vidual members which compose it is that of 
research and investigation." 

The University of Chicago has been, and 
is to-day, a place of investigative work and 
literary activity on the part of teachers and 
students. The professor has only two hours a 
day of class-work ; the rest of the time he is 
free to study and write. He is also given 
occasional leave of absence (six months or a 
year), for travel and study abroad. By the 
system of fellowships and scholarships, a large 
body of picked students are permitted to spend 
laborious days in the interests of learning. 
Upon instructors and fellows rests the obli- 
gation to be productive. For the purpose of 
giving to the world the results of their studies 
and researches, the University has embarked 
in the publishing business. 

The University of Chicago Press issues reg- 
ularly some ten periodicals, edited by the head 
professors and their assistants in the various 
departments — " The American Journal of 
Sociology," "The Journal of Political Econ- 
omy," "The Journal of Theology," "The 
Astrophysical Journal," etc. The University 
Press has also published many pamphlets and 
books. For the most part these publications 
have not been popular in character, although 
interesting to a limited class of readers. By 
their technical treatment of abstruse topics, 
they appeal only to students and specialists. 
They are none the less valuable contributions 
to the literature of science, and deservedly 
rank high in the estimation of scholars the 
world over. 

The University of Chicago opened its doors 
in October, 1892. In commemoration of the 
completion of ten years of its history, last 



October, the University authorities planned a 
series called the " Decennial Publications/' in 
ten volumes, covering the different fields of 
instruction in which its faculties are engaged. 
Volumes I. and II. consist chiefly of President 
Harper's Reports. The remaining eight vol- 
umes are " Investigations," each volume con- 
taining from 300 to 500 pages, royal octavo. 
Each volume has from eight to seventeen 
articles of varying length, dealing with a 
group of allied subjects. The articles also 
appear separately as monographs. There are 
ninety-two articles in all, of which more than 
seventy are in print. Eighty-five writers, in- 
cluding President Harper, have contributed to 
the series. When completed, it will constitute 
a monument of scholarship and scientific re- 
search. Already a considerable number of 
articles have been issued in separate form as 
preprints, each sold at 25 cents and upward. 
It is expected that all of the ten volumes will 
be published during the present year, and most 
of them will be ready in September. The 
character of their contents may be indicated 
to some extent by selecting titles of papers in 
each volume, as announced in the descriptive 
catalogue of the Decennial Publications, First 
Series. 

Volume III. (ready) has two parts. Part 
I., — comprising Systematic Theology, Church 
History, and Practical Theology, — contains 
three articles : " Have we the Likeness of 
Christ?" by Prof. Franklin Johnson ; "Prac- 
tical Sociology in the Service of Social Ethics," 
by Prof. C. R. Henderson; and "The Ele- 
ments of Chrysostom's Power as a Preacher," 
by Dr. Galusha Anderson. Part II., — com- 
prising Philosophy and Education, — contains 
two papers by Dr. J. H. Tufts, " On the Gen- 
esis of the ^Esthetic Categories " and " The 
Individual and his Relation to Society as Re- 
flected in the British Ethics of the Eighteenth 
Century "; also two by Prof. J. R. Angell, " A 
Preliminary Study of the Significance of Par- 
tial Tones in the Localization of Sound " and 
" The Relations of Structural and Functional 
Psychology to Philosophy." Dr. G. H. Mead 
contributes an article on " Psychological An- 
alysis," and Dr. A. W. Moore one on " Exist- 
ence, Meaning, and Reality in Locke and in 
Present Epistemology." 

In Volume IV. (ready) are nine monographs 
by members of the depaitments of Political 
Economy, Political Science, History, and 
Sociology. Prof. J. L. Laughlin writes on 
" Credit," Dr. T. B. Veblen on " The Use of

Loan Credit in Modern Business," Prof. Fred- 
erick Starr on "The Physical Characters of 
the Indians of Southern Mexico," Prof. O. J. 
Thatcher on " Studies concerning Adrian IV.," 
Dr. Ernst Freund on " Empire and Sover- 
eignty," etc. 

Volume V. is made up of eight articles by 
men in the departments of Semitics, Biblical 
Philology, Egyptology, etc. These are chiefly 
translations of ancient documents and lin- 
guistic discussions that can be understood and 
appreciated only by specialists. . President 
Harper contributes to this volume a paper on 
" The Structure of the Text of the Book of 
Micah." 

Volume VI. contains fifteen papers, short 
and long, relating to various matters of signifi- 
cance chiefly to archaeologists and linguists. 
There is, however, one exception. Dr. Carl 
D. Buck, professor of Sanskrit and Indo- 
European Comparative Philology, has written 
an interesting monograph entitled " A Sketch 
of the Linguistic Conditions of Chicago." 
According to Professor Buck, Chicago is the 
most cosmopolitan city in the world. It is " an 
unparalleled babel of foreign tongues," having 
colonies of more than thirty nationalities speak- 
ing some language other than English. He 
says: "Chicago is the second largest Bohemian 
city in the world, the third Norwegian, the 
fourth Polish, the fifth German (New York 
being the fourth). In all, there are some forty 
foreign languages spoken by numbers ranging 
from half a dozen to half a million, and aggre- 
gating over 1,000,000." 

Volume VII. (ready), — The Romance Lan- 
guages and Literatures, the Germanic Lan- 
guages and Literatures, English, Literature 
in English, — has several papers that are 
distinctly literary : " The Treatment of Nature 
in the Works of Nikolaus Lenau," by Prof. 
Camillo von Klenze ; " Studies in Popular 
Poetry," by Prof. P. S. Allen ; " What has 
become of Shakespeare's play ' Love's La- 
bour's Won ' ? " by Prof. A. H. Tolman ; « Some 
Paradoxes of the English Romantic Movement 
of the Eighteenth Century," by Prof. W. D. 
MacClintock ; " Omissions and Insertions in 
Shakespeare's Plays," by Prof. J. M. Manly. 

Volume VIII. is devoted to the subjects of 
Astronomy and Astro-Physics. The papers 
give the results of studies and observations by 
Professors Burnbam, Barnard, Hale, and other 
workers at the Yerkes Observatory. 

Some of the titles in Volume IX. take one's 
breath away. The papers dealing with the 



problems of Mathematics, Chemistry, and 
Physics abound in technicalities that are beyond 
the average reader. They are characterized by 
the exactness of physical science. The eminent 
geologist, Prof. Thomas C. Chamberlin, pre- 
sents a theory of glacier motion based (1) on 
the growth of ice crystals or glacier granules, 
and (2) on the rotation and sliding of these 
granules on one another. It is opposed to the 
current theory of viscosity. 

Volume X. contains seventeen papers by 
men in the different departments of natural 
science — Zoology, Anatomy, Physiology, Neu- 
rology, Botany, Pathology, and Bacteriology. 
At the head of the list is Dr. Jacques Loeb's 
pamphlet " On the Production and Suppression 
of Muscular Twitchings and Hypersensitive- 
ness of the Skin by Electrolytes," which has 
called forth considerable discussion. The in- 
vestigations of Professor Loeb and other biolo- 
gists have a practical bearing. In this paper 
he gives an account of his experiments with 
calcium salts as a cure for paralysis, locomotor 
ataxia, and other nervous diseases. 

In addition to the First Series of Decennial 
Publications, the University announces a Second 
Series in seventeen volumes. These are to be, 
for the most part, extended treatises on such 
subjects as " The Second Bank of the United 
States," by Dr. Ralph C. H. Catterall ; "Light 
Waves and their Uses," by Prof. Albert A. 
Michelson ; " Glacial Studies in Greenland," 
by Prof. Thomas C. Chamberlin; "The 
Finality of the Christian Religion," by Dr. 
George B. Foster, etc. Volumes I. to IX. in- 
clusive are ready. Other volumes will be issued 
in the fall and winter. 

It can be truly said that the University of 
Chicago is carrying out the will of its founder. 
It is training specialists who are productive, 
and its instructors are making valuable contri- 
butions to literature and science, as the De- 
cennial Publications abundantly prove.

Mr. E. R. Du Mont, Chicago, is the publisher, by 
subscription, of " The Works of Voltaire " in English. 
The edition extends to forty-two volumes, the transla- 
tions being partly old, partly new. The publisher has 
just sent us an Index to this edition, which is a stout 
volume in itself. This elaborate piece of work has been 
prepared by Mr. Oliver H. G. Leigh, and its usefulness 
to those who are Compelled to fall back upon the trans-

is even interspersed with illustrative quotations. Vol-

More Greek Glamour.* 



Mr. Howard Crosby Butler, who is Lecturer 
on Architecture at Princeton University, has 
written " The Story of Athens," and in a state- 
ment which serves as a sort of sub-title an- 
nounces that the volume is, in intention, "A 
record of the life and art of the City of the 
Violet Crown, read in the ruins and the lives 
of great Athenians." 

Ruins presume architecture ; and as archi- 
tecture they are not only the survival for us 
of the rich and vivid background of bygone 
work and days, but something well able, when 
interpreted, to instill a subtler understanding 
of their bygone builders and of the life which 
streamed before them. Translated thus, we have 
architecture in terms of life. The lives of great 
Athenians, in terms of architecture, have the 
serious disadvantage of being merely the pin- 
nacles, or aeroteria, so to speak, of their social 
fabric ; and it is rather a clearer understanding 
of the substructure that we are after, these 
days. Pinnacles, however, must be more or 
less an integral part of the supporting mass ; 
therefore one passes the great men, and al- 
lows that in both the ruins and the lives Mr. 
Butler has legitimate material in which to read 
the record of the life and art of the City of 
the Violet Crown. But reading — to read, — 
even a dictionary insists that it is to interpret; 
and of this quality, when one looks for a sounder 
understanding and a more vivid consciousness 
of all that is pent up for us in the word Athens, 
one looks in vain. " The Story of Athens," as 
Mr. Butler reads it in its ruins and in its 
lives, but makes one intensely aware that the 
Athenian accumulation of both since '"Omer 
struck his bloomin ' lyre " has been enormous ; 
and over this mass of record a gentle erudite 
mind plays in a manner somewhat prolix. 

To anyone quite determined to write a sketch 
dealing with some phase of Greek art and life, 
it must be somewhat discouraging that Pater 
and Mahaffy and Taine already have done so. 
This in no way represents a demand that any- 
one, — Mr. Butler, for instance, — shall com- 
bine in his writing Pater's sympathetic and 
illuminating qualities with Mahaffy's keen and 
stimulating suggestiveness ; but it does indi- 
cate that we have been educated by the '-Greek

Illustrated. New York : The Century Co. 



Studies" and the "Social Life," and that the 
standards they have created of historic feeling 
and literary method are the present-day criteria. 
Mr. Butler, as Lecturer on Architecture at 
Princeton University, can hardly be indifferent 
to this condition ; but all the more from his 
position must he be aware of it, and since in 
his volume the Athenian lives do anything but 
live, and there is no exercise of critical faculty 
nor any attempt at interpretative value, one 
must conclude he meant it to be so. On this 
assumption, the book becomes a sort of special 
report, with a good index containing much in- 
formation hitherto dispersed, and if life means 
politics, and art a recital of building operations, 
library- room may be accorded to this " record 
of the life and art of the City of the Violet 
Crown." 

And yet, as one houses it under this classi- 
fication, one knows that many will take the 
book with no such modification, but will accept 
it on the authority of the author's position and 
publisher, and read it as being really the story 
of Athens. So once again is Greek life ex- 
hibited, but not as a whole ; in its refinement* 
but not in its rudeness and cruelty ; in its 
knowledge, but not in its ignorance. Again 
we read of Greek architecture as mines of 
mathematical proportions, but we neither feel 
the breeze that blows between the columns nor 
realize the people passing up and down the 
steps. Homer is incomplete without Hesiod ; 
and the lives of the Athenian great need at 
any rate a mention of the Athenian slave, if 
the reader is to achieve any complete compre- 
hension of the Athenian life. Also, ruins are 
incomplete without some knowledge of the 
ritual which inspired them. But of this there 
is here no hint, nor of any rapport between 
the art and the lives around it, between the 
city and the lives within it. Some day the 
book will be written which will not continually 
refer to the Parthenon as being built on the 
Acropolis, but will show how it grew out of it, 
and will enable us to achieve the broad glance 
which gives as a whole that of which we already 
know too many details. This has not yet been 
done ; and, as already stated, the present vol- 
ume has evidently no such intention. For the 
benefit of the general reader, however, — not 
that I care particularly about him, but suppos- 
ing that Mr. Butler does, — it would seem 
kinder to select a more exact title, or perhaps 
to re-write the story.

Timely Problems in Education.* 



A number of recent English converts to co- 
education have contributed their testimony to form 
a small volume edited by Miss Alice Woods. Until 
very recently, co-education has been merely tol- 
erated in England, among the lowest elementary 
schools in the rural districts, from considerations of 
economy. In the last few years, however, a small 
group of high-class private and grammar schools 
have cautiously begun the experiment. If the pa- 
pers in tbe present volume are in any sense repre- 
sentative, the experiments must have been unusually 
successful ; for the authors write with the ardor and 
enthusiasm of discoverers. From an intellectual 
standpoint, it has been found that the boys and 
girls supplement each other ; the interest increases 
with the introduction of the new system, and dis- 
cipline is easier than under the old plan. The 
writers spend much of their space in meeting 
& priori moral objections to co-education, which 
seems to be the doubtful point with English parents. 
These teachers all testify that although the in- 
structors maintain strict watch, in an unobtrusive 
manner, the relations between the sexes are in a 
vast majority of cases so healthful that no in- 
terference or additional regulations are needed. 
Indeed, one writer goes so far as to advocate co- 
education on moral grounds, holding the view that 
boys' schools must always be subject to epidemics 
of immorality as long as the boys are maintained 
in separate institutions. These teachers found that 
co-education in no way interfered with the athletic 
efficiency of the boys, or with the cultivation of 
good manners among the girls. 

This view of co-education is, of course, an old 
story to American teachers ; it is also supported 
by the experience of Scotland and the English 
colonies. Hence we can tentatively conclude that 
among English-speaking peoples, at least, expe- 
rience proves the expediency of co-education for 
boys and girls below the age of twelve or thirteen. 
As Dr. Michael E. Sadler, of the English Education 
Department, points out in his introduction to this 
volume, the expediency of co education through ad- 
olescence (from twelve to eighteen) is an entirely 
different problem. He is in accord with the writers

in this volume in regard to the advisability of co- 
education during the period of childhood, but for 
the later period he has this to say : 

"No one who is at all aware of the complexity of the 
facts involved or sensitive to the differences in the social 
ideals which consciously or unconsciously, affect people's 
wishes for tbe training of the young, would think of laying 
down a hard and fast line about coeducation. But I for 
one believe that in the greater number of cases to be edu- 
cated in common with boys throughout the latter part of 
her secondary school career would not be the best kind of 
training for a girl. Many of the studies most suitable or nec- 
essary for boys of fourteen and upwards would be a good deal 
out of gear with her future practical needs, at any rate if she 
is to be a a home maker and still more if she is to be a mother 
of children. Again, at the age in question a girl ought not as 
a rule to work at the same pace as a boy, nor ought she to 
play most games as hard as it is good for a robust boy to 
play them." (Pagexiv.) 

One at all alive to the silent drift of opinion 
must have noticed the growth of a public sentiment 
similar to that here expressed by Mr. Sadler, among 
tbe more intelligent classes in our larger towns 
and cities. There is a feeling that the old frontier 
conditions of life which made co-education so neces- 
sary and salutary in high-schools are making way 
for a much more complex environment. The in- 
timate associations of the class-room during the 
emotional period of youth means one thing in a 
small country town, where every pupil knows by 
reputation every other pupil's family and stand- 
ing ; but in a large city it means something far 
different. There is a chapter in the life of many 
co-educational high-schools which is never told, be- 
cause it is to everyone's interest to forget it. The 
success achieved by many ambitious girls in reach- 
ing, and often surpassing, the standard originally 
designed for the greater strength of their brothers, 
is triumphantly used by the co-educationists, re- 
gardless of the well-known fact that many such 
girls enfeeble their health for life by such achiev- 
ments. Until lately, the real issue has remained in 
the background, while coeducation in colleges has 
been the bone of contention. On this question, then, 
it may be said by way of summary, that English 
and American teachers are slowly coming to agree- 
ment, — the advantages of co-education for the ele- 
mentary period, and its disadvantages for the pupils 
of the secondary age, being seen by both. 

Mr. Richard Rogers Bowker has added an edu- 
cational volume to his series of critical essays which 
treat of the different fundamental interests of mod- 
ern life. The first and most important paper in the 
present collection, which discusses education in gen- 
eral, follows in its main outlines the well-known 
treatise of Mr. Herbert Spencer. The style is ex- 
cellent, and the author has a genius for catching 
and phrasing the more subtle tendencies of the age. 
The two remaining essays in the volume, on " The 
Scholar, the Making and Use of Him," and " The 
College of To-day," were written twenty years pre- 
vious to publication, and form an excellent state- 
ment of the old ideal of eollege training. Mr. 
Bowker is a firm believer in the theory that the

college should equip its graduates with the impor- 
tant results and methods of thought in the entire 
circles of scientific disciplines. This ideal is some- 
times defended to-day, but its realization is seldom 
attempted. The merits of Mr. Bowker's book are 
largely literary ; its appeal is to the general read- 
ing public, and its value is largely that of an in- 
troduction. 

" The Place of Industries in Elementary Educa- 
tion," by Miss Katharine Elizabeth Dopp, contains 
a careful elaboration of the social basis of early 
education as set forth by Dr. Dewey of the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. The introductory chapter is a clear 
statement of the main outlines of the Dewey theory. 
In the second chapter on '• The Significance of In- 
dustrial Epochs," we find a careful and suggestive 
study of the reaction of the different industrial 
periods on race intelligence. The third chapter is 
psychological, treating of the origins of Attitudes 
that underlie Industry ; and the fourth is peda- 
gogical, showing how the essential values of early 
industry are to be obtained in the modern city 
school-room. The author directs the attention of 
teachers to anthropological material which can be 
utilized in the schools. The conclusions are briefly 
put in the fifth chapter. The book is provided with 
an excellent index. The author has evidently lav- 
ished time and attention on the logical development 
of a single vein of ideas, and in consequence her 
work is conspicuous among educational books for 
good workmanship. Her thesis is so intertwined 
with Dr. Dewey's ideas, that it must necessarily 
stand or fall with them. 

In three addresses now published in book form, 
President Eliot of Harvard has " taken account of 
stock " as far as the American public-school system 
is concerned. The first chapter might be charac- 
terized as treating of •• What the public-school has 
failed to do." An enumeration of the weak points 
in American life gives us this indictment : as a na- 
tion, we are characterized by excessive alcoholism, 
a vast amount of gambling, municipal misgovern- 
ment. numerous crimes of violence, yellow journals 
and theatres, strikes, faith in patent medicines, and 
the spoils system of appointments. President Eliot 
in his second address shows us the golden side of 
the shield. In the field of education proper, there 
has been much progress in the last generation. 
Among the most important improvements have 
been the introduction of kindergarten methods, the 
expansion of the elementary curriculum, the organ- 
ization of improved systems of secondary education, 
a higher standard of admission to normal schools, 
larger employment of educational experts, and in- 
creased attention to the education of the body. As 
the title states, the book is a plea for more money ; 
and in the last address President Eliot tells us what 
he would do with more money if he had it. Med- 
ical supervision and more sanitary school-houses 
would be secured ; while more male teachers, and 
a smaller number of pupils per teacher, would be 
provided for. Music, drawing, and modern lan- 



guages would be introduced into the curriculum ; 
vacation schools and mechanic arts high-schools 
would be established. 

The recent criticism of a distinguished psycho- 
logist aimed at certain pedagogical thinkers has 
provoked in reaction a large number of protests, 
two of which are now before us. Professor Sinclair, 
vice- principal of the normal school at Ottawa, Can- 
ada, bases his argument on " the possibility of a 
science of education " on the returns to a question- 
naire syllabus which he issued to a number of uni- 
versity professors and presidents. A large majority 
of those responding — forty-five out of fifty-seven — 
favor the professional training of teachers. These 
replies, which Professor Sinclair publishes in an 
appendix, show the drift of opinion among one class 
of professional men, and are interesting reading. 
As professor Sinclair tells us nothing concerning 
the opportunities which these scientists have had 
for observing educational problems and conditions, 
we must assume that in this respect they were 
simply average men ; in which case their opinions, 
except those of the presidents, are about as much 
to the point as would be the judgment of a number 
of expert engineers on the " case method " of study- 
ing law. Professor Sinclair's thesis is developed 
with great care and an abundance of scientific no- 
menclature. He first refutes certain popular fal- 
lacies, then explains what he means by the "dynamic 
conception of educational science," and finally indi- 
cates the value of such a science to school-teachers. 
His conclusions are safe and cautious, and would 
probably be accepted without difficulty by all per- 
sons qualified to express an opinion. As a rule, 
Professor Sinclair's results are too obvious and 
general to be of much service to instructors in ped- 
agogy, and too technically phrased to reach the 
public. The real problems in the professional train- 
ing of teachers are those of concrete methods and 
results, which Professor Sinclair leaves untouched. 

Miss Young's paper on " Scientific Method in 
Education " is an able but brief description of the 
need for a science which shall treat education at 
first hand. It is published as one of the decennial 
publications of the University of Chicago.

Dublin, in " Mediaeval India Under Mohammedan 
Rule" (Putnam). The work is a chronicle of 
kings, courts, and conquests, — the story of the 
lives and deeds of a few great men and great wom-

greatest interest in the people themselves, in the 
development of constitutions, of civic rights, of 
individual liberties, or in the evolution of self-gov-

of this sort. The masses of India know nothing of 
these things. They have had kings with despotic 
power since time immemorial. They believe that 
" power is a divine gift, to be exercised absolutely 
by God's anointed, and obeyed unquestioned by 
everybody else ; " and, seemingly with no vain 
longings, no murmurings, no dissatisfaction, they 
submit to domination, saying : " Whatever king 
may rule, there will still be plague and famine, and 
constant but not energetic labor ; and so long as 
the rice and millet grow, and salt is not too dear, 
life is much the same, and the gods may be pro- 
pitiated. The difference caused in the rayat's life 
by a good or a bad king is too slight to be worth 
discussing. The good and the ill are alike things 
of a day ; they pass away as the life passes when 
the king decrees a death or massacres a village ; 
but others follow, and the world goes on, and the will 
of God is eternal." Aryan, Hun, Greek, Persian, 
Rajput, Turk, Afghan, and Mongol rulers, with 
their followers, in turn have settled in India, and 
remained there for years ; yet they have scarcely 
touched the soul of the people. There has been no 
assimilation of either foreigners or their ideas. The 
subject-matter of Professor Lane-Poole's book is 
intensely interesting, and, presented in easy, fluent 
style, is delightful reading. It is history with all 
the charm of romance. There is an ample number 
of illustrations, — in all, fifty-eight, — prints of 
portraits of Moghul Emperors, and of their palaces, 
mosques, and tombs. The appendix gives chrono- 
logical and genealogical tables which supply details 
omitted in the narrative. A list of the best works 
of European travellers during the seventeenth cen- 
tury is of especial value to those who wish to go 
more deeply into the subject than does the author 
in a work which aims to be only the outline of a 
long, long story. 

Professor Leo Wiener's " Anthology 

Russian writers * t> • T •*. >» /t» <. \ 

of the wth century. of Bussian Literature (Putnam) 
has now been completed by the 
publication of the second volume, dealing with the 
writers of the nineteenth century. More strictly 
ppeaking, the scope of the work is the first three- 
quarters of the nineteenth century, for the last 
decades and the younger writers of to-day find 
scant representation. Of men born since 1850, only 
seven find a place, the last two being Mr. Pyeshkov 
(Gorki), and Professor Merezhkovski, neither of 
whom could well be omitted. From Karamzin 
and Krylov, who open the volume, to these two 



who close it, fifty-three writers are recognized, each 
being represented by a brief biography, and a selec- 
tion, or group of selections, from his work. An 
important feature of this volume is offered by the 
selections that represent Russian criticism, since 
these provide us with a commentary upon the very 
nineteenth-century Russian literature to which the 
volume is devoted. Professor Wiener's introduc- 
tory essay is thoughtful and suggestive. Perhaps 
its most significant passage is the following : " Lit- 
erature has been in Russia the field in which all 
the battles of progress have been fought. As there 
does not exist a representative government, where 
political opinions may struggle for recognition, and 
as there cannot exist a public opinion based on 
traditions and class interests, literature alone ap- 
pears as the medium for advancing social and 
political ideas; and since scientific treatises reach 
but a vanishing proportion of the nation, belles- 
lettres proper have in Russia become the means for 
inculcating and propagating truths. In the begin- 
ning of the nineteenth century this was not yet so 
apparent, and literature for arts' sake could hold 
its own. But with the advancing democratisation 
of society, literature gathered ever more around 
camps with definite ideas, and literary art receded 
more and more and lived out its day in oblivion." 
This Russian anthology that Professor Wiener has 
edited is a very valuable addition to the library of 
the student of literary history, who should be 
extremely grateful for this means of making an 
acquaintance, almost at first hand, with all that is 
most important in the literature of the great and 
little-known Russian people. A minor but very 
genuine cause for gratitude will be found in the 
fact that the pronunciation of proper names is 
indicated throughout the work, a matter of no little 
importance when we take into account the capricious 
distribution of accents in Russian names.

Moore, the author of "The Old 
China Book " (Stokes) paraphrases Carlyle's fa- 
mous saying, " From a small window one may view 
the infinite." While the book contains much exact 
information about English pottery and its makers, 
it also possesses literary charm and interest for the 
general reader. The author's treatment of the sub- 
ject is much broader than that of a mere collector, 
and the book gains greatly thereby. He studies 
plates and jugs as "valuable historical documents" 
and his pages are full of interesting details con- 
cerning notable persons and places. Of especial 
interest are extracts from letters of Washington 
and Franklin, showing that in the midst of grave 
affairs they knew the charm of " old blue." The 
china made in commemoration of Lafayette's visit 
receives careful description ; also that celebrating 
the opening of the Erie Canal, and pieces that pic- 
ture landmarks long since removed. " We are too 
anxious to renew, rebuild, pull down and put up

something larger and better," says Mr. Moore ; and 
he finds in the love of old china a remedy for the 
hurry and unrest of modern life. The history of 
English pottery is traced from the earliest examples, 
made about 1560, through the " golden age "' of 
Wedgwood, down to the present time. China made 
for the American market during the early part of 
last century is especially described, particularly the 
wares made in Staffordshire by Wood, the Clews, 
Stevenson, and others less well known. The ac- 
count of Josiah Wedgwood and his work is very 
full ; while porcelain made at Derby, Worcester, 
and Chelsea receives due attention. Mr. Moore 
discusses at some length processes of manufacture, 
marks of identification, and the present value of 
treasures once stored away in dusty corners of the 
attic. The many fine illustrations and the com- 
plete index add to the usefulness of the book. The 
author frankly acknowledges that he wrote for 
the " happy possessors of a hobby," and surely the 
charm of his book will go far to increase the num- 
ber of those fortunate people. 

The problem Since the time of Darwin, great ad- 

o/ Variation in vances have been made in the study 
plant* and animal*. Q f tne phenomenon of variation in 
plants and animals. Statistics and higher mathe- 
matics have been called upon to define and delimit 
the process as it occurs in nature, and the experi- 
mental method has been utilized to unlock the 
secret causes at its foundation. Dr. H. M. Vernon, 
of Magdalen College, Oxford, has been one of the 
foremost investigators and experimenters in this 
field, and he has summarized his own work and 
that of others upon this problem in his recent book, 
" Variation in Animals and Plants" (Holt), in a 
critical way, and relates his conclusions to the prob- 
lems of evolution and heredity. While thoroughly 
scientific, this book is not over-technical either in 
biological terminology or mathematical methods. 
The intimate relation which variation bears to 
evolution and heredity, and the timeliness and 
thoroughness of Dr. Vernon's treatment of his sub- 
ject, make his book a desideratum to all investiga- 
tors and thinkers on these vital subjects. After a 
discussion of the measurement of variation, the au- 
thor takes up dimorphism and discontinuous vari- 
ation, including De Vrie's theory of Mutation. 
Correlated variations, especially in man. and the 
action of genetic selection in human evolution, com- 
plete his discussion of the facts of variation. The 
causes of variation are treated very fully, including 
amphimixis, reversion, prepotency, sports, monsters, 
bad variation, hybrids, and the recently rediscovered 
Mendelian laws of hybridization. The diminish- 
ing effect of the environment, with age and with 
growth, is formulated into a law. and the effects of 
migration in increasing variability are noted. The 
author is inclined to think that Darwin overesti- 
mated the effect of domestication in causing 
variations, since the study of wild animals has re- 
vealed equal divergences in nature. He also

inclines to a belief in the direct action of the en- 
vironment upon the germ-cells, which differs but 
little from inheritance of acquired characters. This 
is a stimulating book for biologists, sociologists, 

and philosophers 

Certain books are of such a char- 
acter that the reader's first impres- 
sion is not one of details at all, but 
rather of the work as a whole. Such a book is Mr. 
Ernest F. H. Capey's "Life of Erasmus" (Dut- 
ton), and on laying it aside the first thought is, "a 
charming bit of biography." Considering the 
separate chapters, one finds the earlier ones are not 
quite up to the level of the rest. One misses in 
them an adequate statement of those facts of 
heredity and environment that were so potent in 
developing the career of the great humanist. But 
no such criticism of inadequacy can be made of 
those portions of the book dealing with the period 
of his real activity. The emphasis is properly laid 
upon his immense, and now well-nigh forgotten, 
importance as a man of letters, — it is hard to re- 
alize that with the passing of Latin as a universal 
language no modern writer, not even Goethe, has 
enjoyed the general European repution of Erasmus, 
— but his relation to the Reformation is also well 
and clearly discussed. In the pages of this little 
book the man becomes a definite personality. His 
weaknesses are by no means passed over, his sane 
and enlightened views — often so far in advance of 
his age, so strikingly modern — are duly and fairly 
presented. There is no attempt, however, to ex- 
ploit the hero. A wise reticence is also observed 
in dealing with some questions when the evidence 
is not conclusive ; while the mass of legend, both 
creditable and otherwise, is altogether ignored. An 
excellent bibliography, with special mention of En- 
glish translations of the works of Erasmus and a 
selected list of biographical studies and magazine 
articles, is appended ; while an admirable index 
completes the book and makes it an available tool 
for the special student of literature or history, as 
well as a work that will attract the general reader. 

All special students of the subject 
" ha^a'Brtjy are »g r eed that to every mental 

state there somehow " corresponds " 
a state of the brain. But in the interpretation of 
the how, authorities differ to-day almost as widely 
as they did a generation ago. The fact is that the 
problem, despite its paramount importance, has not 
been studied with the circumspection and care it 
deserves. Those who are in any degree interested 
in the subject will accordingly welcome Professor 
C. A. Strong's " Why the Mind has a Body " (Mac- 
millan), for here will be found a comprehensive and 
detailed survey of the field by one who is thoroughly 
equipped for his work. Professor Strong first ex- 
amines, at some length, the more important current 
hypotheses as to the relation of mind and brain. 
Their conflicting claims, he concludes, cannot be 
adjudicated without an inquiry into the real nature

of both terms of the relation. To this topic, with 
its ramifications, he accordingly devotes the second 
part of the book. From the vantage-ground thus 
gained he proceeds, in Part Three, to subject the 
reigning theories to a re-examination and to state 
his own solution. The work of the first two parts 
is very well done. The treatment is clear, objective, 
fairly thorough, and in the main convincing. But 
in the last part the author too often shows undue 
haste to arrive at the conclusion of his journey. 
His criticism becomes, at important points, super- 
ficial ; while the formulation of his own position is 
left too abstract, and, apparently, exposed to obvious 
objections. Professor Strong, however, promises to 
develop the positive side of his thesis at length in 
a second volume. There we may expect his theory 
to appear in the needed clearness and concreteness. 
There too the objections that can be urged against it 
will doubtless be considered with the care to which 

they are entitled. 

More etches C .anon Rawnsley has just published 
oftheEngiith his fifth book on the subject of the 
Lake country. La k e Country and the literary lights 

that have added so much to its interest. This 
latest volume, which is charmingly bound and 
illustrated, is called " Lake Country Sketches " 
(Macmillan). The opening essay gives some rem- 
iniscences of Wordsworth that are yet lingering in 
the minds of various humble folk who in their youth 
served in one capacity or another at Rydal Mount. 
All agree that the great poet was wont " to say 
nowt to noabody," and " to bum and boo about," 
— that is, to mumble to himself ; not one of them 
seems to have cared much for him, all found genial 
Hartley Coleridge more to their liking, and all were 
of the opinion that Coleridge and the poet's sister, 
Miss Wordsworth, wrote his poetry for him. It is 
a curious fact that to-day few of the country folk 
round about where Wordsworth lived have read his 
verse or even possess copies of it. One peasant, 
when questioned about the poems, answered : "Well, 
you see, blessed barn, there's pomes and pomes, and 
Wudsworth's was not for sec as us." With the ex- 
ception of a sketch called " Wordsworth at Cocker- 
mouth," the book concerns itself with descriptions 
of the country side, its quaint characters, and bits 
of folk-lore. Character sketches, like "A Skiddaw 
Shepherd," gives one a good idea of the material 
which Wordsworth had at his command when he 
wished to picture men of fine character in the hum- 
bler walks of life. In style, Canon Rawnsley's work 
is delightful. In simple English he tells of his 
loved Lake Country in its varying moods, revealing 
in all that he writes his own charming personality, 
his intense love of and sympathy with nature, and 
with his own human kind. 



Psychology 
Jot teachers. 



Dr. Charles H. Judd, of Yale Uni- 
versity, has put forth a very help- 
ful book, " Genetic Psychology for 
Teachers " (Appleton), that is likely to find, as it 
deserves, a wide circle of readers among those en- 



gaged in the profession that we often laud in theory 
and disdain in fact. It is not easy to offer to that 
large company of workers in the field of letters 
something that will furnish inspiration for the con- 
siderable drudgery of the work, and a guiding light 
through maze-like and unilluminated paths. Dr. 
Judd believes this can best be done by presenting 
concrete illustrations of the growth of mental ac- 
quisition and attainment in the history of the indi- 
vidual and of the race. His success goes far to 
demonstrate the correctness of his aim. His scope 
of topics is wide and # advisedly selective rather that 
systematic. The teacher's world, like that of every- 
one else, is full of a number of things, and its va- 
riety is the antidote to the prescribed monotony of 
the earlier and conventional experience. The story 
of the growth of writing among men, the change of 
educational ideals with the march of the centuries, 
the encounters with fact by which knowledge grows, 
and the analysis of the interpretation of experience, 
furnish a suggestive background for the setting of 
tasks and the training of the young idea. Dr. 
Judd's book, while not achieving an unusual or 
epoch-making importance, is distinctly successful 
in the well-defined field that it covers. 



Few men can write more entertain- 

frfuh statesmen. ' m S}7 0D P° Htic8 and ° ther CU " ent 

topics than Mr. Justin McCarthy. 
His long and intimate acquaintance with the public 
men of Great Britain, his even longer training as a 
journalist, and his always genial spirit, combine to 
make his new volume, " British Political Portraits " 
(The Outlook Co.), a desirable book for the 
hammock or the train. The matter was originally 
written as sketches for " The Outlook." Thirteen 
British statesmen are portrayed, among them Bal- 
four, Morley, Bryce, Labouchere, Lord Rosebery, 
and John Burns. These and others are treated 
with light touch and a full measure of appreciation. 
Whether they were the writer's political foes or 
friends, their virtues are duly set forth and their 
faults are almost shown to be virtues. There is 
little in the book for one whose knowledge of British 
politics is at all extended, but the sketches will be 
of value to those who may desire to become ac- 
quainted with the men whose names are prominent 
in British affairs. 

" Historical Essays and Reviews," 
Historical essays written by Dr> Mandell Creighton, 

and reviews. J o ' 

D.D., D.C.L., LL.D., and edited by 
Miss Louise Creighton, is a volume made up of 
eleven essays on historical subjects and four book 
reviews (Longmans, Green, & Co.). These chap- 
ters, which have no especial connection with each 
other, the editor states in the preface are grouped 
together for the reason that they illustrate the 
author's activities. Six of the eleven essays treat of 
Italian characters, most of whom lived during the 
Renaissance period ; three of the four reviews are 
on Italian subjects ; the rest are English, with the 
exception of descriptions, very elaborate in detail,

of " The Two Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary Com- 
memoration Exercises at Harvard University " and 
" The Imperial Coronation at Moscow " ; and all 
appeared originally in various English magazines. 
A knowledge of the hooks discussed would add to 
the interest of the reviews, which apart from that 
knowledge depends largely on the author's scholarly 
and briliiaut style. 

The life of Leonardo da Vinci, writ- 
Lemardo ten by Dr. Georg Gronau and trans- 

lated from the original German by 
Frederick Pledge, is a very interesting little book 
issued in the '• Popular Library of Art" (Dutton). 
The author does not attempt to go into the details 
of the numerous controversies concerning the facts 
of Leonardo's biography and the authenticity of 
certain of his works, or rather of the works attrib- 
uted to him, but gives the data for which there is 
authority, his own conclusions on disputed points, 
and descriptions of his work with an ample number 
of illustrations. What he offers in the way of 
biography is all that is really known of the great 
genius, yet the book leaves one with a feeling of 
disappointment. One wishes to know so much more 
of Leonardo the man, and regrets that this versatile 
master left comparatively so little, and that, of what 
he did leave, so much has been lost, or is in a poor 
state of preservation — as, for example, the paint- 
ing of ■ The Last Supper." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Sard of Metaphysics," a volume sent us by 
the Open Court Publishing Co., is one of the most in- 
teresting and valuable of the many philosophical wri- 
tings of Dr. Paul Cams. It is an inquiry into the 
question of the Ding an Sich, and its author, although 
recognizing the importance of the Kantian doctrine, 
and even its necessity at a certain stage in the evolution 
of thought, rejects it as no longer tenable, and as a 
mere philosophical superstition. While we are hardly 
willing to admit that this discussion really eliminates 
the ■ thing-in-itself " from philosophy, we are glad to 
pay tribute to the stimulating and suggestive character 
of the arguments advanced by Dr. Carus, and to the 
interest of his summary of post-Kantian opinion upon 
this subject. 

" The Basis of Morality," by Arthur Schopenhauer, 
is the most important of the philosopher's minor works 
hitherto untranslated into English. A translation has 
now been made by Mr. Arthur Brodrick Bullock, and 
is published by the Macmillan Co. This is the famous 
essay that was not crowned by the Danish Royal Society, 
a rejection upon which Schopenhauer afterwards com- 
mented in his most caustic vein of irony. It is a pity 
that the translator should not have given us these 
comments, which form the introduction to the German 
edition, as well as the text of the essay itself. As for 
the main work, it is one of the soundest and most stim- 
ulating of ethical treatises, and we cannot urge its read- 
ing too strongly upon those who have not yet made its 
acquaintance. 



Mr. Merrick Whitcomb's " A History of Modern 
Europe " is a new " Twentieth Century Text-Book " 
published by the Messrs. Appleton. We have frequently 
had occasion to commend the books prepared for this 
series, and this latest addition to their number is a work 
of exceptional importance. Its distinctive features are 
found in the selection of illustrations, in the fact that 
more than half of the volume is devoted to the nine- 
teenth century, and in the source-material offered with 
the several chapters. These source extracts are neces- 
sarily brief, bat they are chosen with singular judicious- 
ness, and often illuminate in a quite unexpected way 
the narrative text. A synopsis of " leading events " 
affords a useful method of summary and review. 

A quarter of a century ago, plant physiology was a 
subject that hardly existed for teaching purposes, or 
otherwise than as an abstract division of botanicnl 
science theoretically posited, but not worked out in any 
systematic way. Now, every department of botanical 
a sizable college gives courses in it, and text-books, 
both German and English, exist in numbers. The 
latest addition to them is " A Text-Book of Plant 
Physiology," by Dr. George James Pierce, which has 
just been published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It 
is a work of considerable dimensions, for advanced 
college use, and is based upon a teaching experience of 
several years with the subject. The author states his 
aim to have been " to express safe views rather than 
to echo the most recent," which is a very wise plan in 
dealing with so rapidly-developing a subject.

delphia and Chicago, will become the American agency 
for the new translation of the Bible into the idiom of 
to-day, by Mr. Ferrar Fenton. It is published in one 
volume containing both the Old aud New Testaments, 
and also in separate parts. This version of the Bible 
is said to " bring before English readers the real mean- 
ing of the text as no other translation has done." 

" First Lessons in United States History," by Edward 
Channing, is attractively gotten up by the Macmillan 
Company. It is very elementary and brief, and its 
statements are so put that the inferences of cause and 
effect, which children are so quick to draw, are often 
inaccurate and distorted. The courts, it may be added, 
decided that the assassin of President McKinley was 
not "an insane person," which is the author's state- 
ment. 

Four small volumes on "The Art of Writing and 
Speaking the English Language," prepared by Mr. 
Sherwin Cody, are published with the imprint of The 
Old Greek Press, Chicago. One of the volumes is given 
to Word-Study, one to Composition, one to Grammar

and Punctuation, and one to Constructive Rhetoric. 
The volumes are of a practical, handy sort, compact 
in form, and inexpensive. They are intended for indi- 
viduals needing such instruction as is here sought to 
be given, as well as for use in schools. 

President L. H. Jones is the compiler of " The Jones 
Readers," in five volumes, published by Messrs. Ginn & 
Co. These five graded books contain a total of 1568 
pages, and are praiseworthy as to their typography, 
their illustrations, and the literary character of the 
selections offered. Ethical ideals have been especially 
kept in view by the editor, and a progressive develop- 
ment of the child's vocabulary is the underlying educa- 
tional aim of the volumes. 

Ben Jonson's " The Alchemist," edited, with intro- 
duction, notes, and a glossary, by Dr. Charles Mont- 
gomery Hathaway, is the latest addition to the " Yale 
Studies in English," published for Yale University by 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. The work was prepared as 
a doctoral thesis, and is of the most elaborate character, 
including a lengthy sketch of the history of alchemy, 
a bibliography, a discussion of Jonson's sources, over a 
hundred pages of notes, an extensive glossary, and an 
index. 

The John Crerar Library has just published a sup- 
plement to its list of serial publications contained in 
the public libraries of Chicago and Evanston, making 
many additions to the contents of the earlier publication, 
and providing complete information up to the date of 
last April. These two lists are of the greatest useful- 
ness to students in the vicinity of Chicago, and their 
preparation by the authorities of the John Crerar Li- 
brary is a public-spirited undertaking that deserves 
warm recognition. 

We wrote not long ago in praise of Mr. Percival 
Chubb's volume on the teaching of English, and we 
now have occasion to commend a second work upon 
this important subject. " The Teaching of English in 
the Elementary and the Secondary School," just pub- 
lished by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. in the 
" American Teachers' Series," is the joint production 
of Professors George Rice Carpenter, Franklin T. 
Baker, and Fred N. Scott. These are the best of 
names for the purpose, and the volume which has thus 
been prepared is a manual of absolutely indispensable 
importance to every teacher of the subject in this 
country. This we say not merely because of the sound 
doctrine which the book preaches, but also because of 
the extreme helpfulness of its practical suggestions, its 
valuable outlines, references, and special bibliographies. 
In these latter respects, the work is more elaborate 
than Mr. Chubb's otherwise similar treatment of the 
subject.

THE DIAL 

& &tmU$®ont$lv Journal of Eiterarp Crittcigm, 2Dtecu00ion, and information 



IN the flood of books pouring daily from the press there is so much to choose from that 
no person can, unaided, judge what is to be read and what left unread. Hence a journal 
that may be steadily trusted as a safe and agreeable guide to the character, the contents, the 
merits and demerits, of the important new books is obviously of the greatest value to everyone 
of literary inclinations or pursuits. Such a journal The Dial has long been known to be. 
Established for nearly a quarter of a century, it is generally recognized by the highest critical 
authorities as "the leading literary journal of America." In its pages the new books are 
described and discussed upon their merits, without fear or favor, by the ablest scholars and 
critics in the country. To all who need a trustworthy and independent guide and aid in the 
complex field of current literature The Dial is altogether indispensable. 



SOME BRIEF OPINIONS 



The Dial has no superior among the literary 
journals of the country in intelligence, dignity, and 
weight. It has always treated literature with the ut- 
most seriousness and with the fullest knowledge. It 
has never sought by any lightness of tone or by the 
introduction of the personal element to secure a large 
constituency, but has addressed itself to thinkers, 
scholars, and students of literature. 

The Outlook, New York. 



The Dial is sober, conscientious, and scholarly; 
from every point of view unsurpassed by any other 
literary journal in America or England. 

Sir Walter Besant. 



The Dial is easily our most valuable literary 
review. It has been faithful to the best literary tra- 
ditions from the first, and will no doubt continue to 
be so. John Burroughs. 



The Dial I think is by far the best of our 
American literary journals. It stands up against 
provinciality, yet is not servile to foreign critics. It 
holds to the old, while not turning its back on the 
new. It is sane and honest, and while sympathetic 
has nothing of the gush that we sometimes find. 

William P. Trent. 



The Dial's look and bearing are refinement 
itself. Seriousness, fearless care, and a right instinct 
in letters, help to make it the best review we have. 
The Independent, New York. 



The Dial has always stood for character. It has 
the old Puritan conscience on which everything that 
is lasting in our country is built. It is sane, wise, 
truthful; it is honest, hopeful, and kindly; and with 
all this it is the best journal of literary criticism which 
we have, and we ask no better. 

David Starr Jordan. 



The Dial seems at present the most unbiased, 
good humored, and sensible organ of American crit- 
icism. Barrett Wendell 

in "A Literary History of America." 



The Dial is the best literary paper in the United 
States, and second to none in Great Britain. 

The National Review, London.

A History of England for Schools 

By BENJAMIN TERRY, Ph.D., LL.D. 

Professor in the University of Chicago. 

Professor Terry's History of England has that catholic treatment of all subjects that marks it 
as the book of a scholar. His sympathy with the feelings and needs of pupils makes the book 
especially adapted to use as a text-book in secondary schools. 

The maps throughout the book, interspersed at fitting places, lend a value to the author's 
treatment of the various periods of the history, while the abundance of helpful material, special 
topics for study, questions, and references make the book peculiarly valuable for class-room work.

FOUR NOTEWORTHY BOOKS 

The Millionaire's Son 

By Anna Robeson Brown, author of " The Immortal Garland," " The Cosmopolitan Comedy," " Sir 

Mark," " Truth and a Woman," etc. 

The story of a young man's struggle to choose between the material advantages of wealth, questionably 
obtained, and ostentatiously spent, and the higher claims of social service. This novel is a study in tempera- 
ment and heredity, and a brilliant satire on social conditions in the smaller American cities. But first of all it is 
an absorbing story, told with remarkable facility and power. The central situation on which the plot turns is one 
of the most original in modern fiction. Illustrated with full-page drawings by A. E. Becher. Cloth, 12mo. $1.50. 

Some Famous American Schools 

By Oscar Fay Adams, author of " The Story of Jane Austen's Life," " The Dictionary of American 

Authors," etc. 

A popular account of the foundation, history, and traditions of such noted American boys' schools as 
Phillips Exeter, Phillips Andover, St. Paul's, Lawrenceville, St. Mark's, Groton, and others. The author's pur- 
pose is to supply a readable description of nine American preparatory schools, touching only lightly on their 
scholastic side, but giving such impressions of each as the average observer would obtain in the course of a brief 
visit. This is the first and only publication in its field, and the result of untiring research and correspondence. 
It is filled with anecdotes of famous events in the academic and athletic life of the schools represented, and is 
written in a style of unusual charm and distinction. The book is illustrated with more than fifty half-tones from 
new photographs. Cloth, 12mo. $1.20 net. 

The Hermit's Wild Friends 

or, Eighteen Years in the Woods 
By Mason A. Walton. 

A volume of animal and woodcraft lore, by the well-known hermit of Gloucester, Mass. Mr. Walton has 
contributed for years to " Forest and Stream," under the pseudonym of " Hermit," and he has also written for 
the " Youth's Companion," and other periodicals. Thousands of persons have penetrated to his log cabin in the 
woods, where he has lived entirely alone for nearly a score of years. This book is illustrated in part by the 
author's photographs of wild creatures which have come under his own observation, and in part by original 
drawings from the pen of Louis Agassiz Fuertes and other eminent artists. Cloth, 12mo. $1.50 net. 

Florestane, The Troubadour 

A Romance 
By Julia de Wolf Addison. 
This novel carries the reader back to the Middle Ages with their Courts of Love, minstrels, jongleurs, 
knights, and crusaders, and introduces among its characters Dante, Cimabue, Sordello, and other celebrated men. 
The atmosphere is that of chivalric ideals with a background of mediaeval color and romance. The book is 
crowded with exciting episodes, and once taken up it will not easily be laid aside until finished. It combines 
every element of a successful novel, not omitting to mention the mechanical requisites of attractive binding and 
typography. Cloth, 12mo. $1.00.

it with dignity and full grasp of its depth and power." 

"Reading it was a constantly increasing delight." 

" It is an essentially American novel and one dealing 
with a phase of American life from an entirely new point 
of view. Much has been written about the university 
life of the student ; Miss Sholl is our first novelist to set 
before us the university life, socially and academically, of

Popular Editions of Rare and Famous Books 

MESSRS. D. APPLETON AND COMPANY take pleasure in announcing for early publication a 
number of rare and famous illustrated books of fiction and general literature, faithfully reprinted, in 
small form, from the first or best editions with introduction or notes. 

The particular and attractive feature of these books is the reproduction of all the illustrations, in 
colors or otherwise, which appeared in the original issues; illustrations which are part and parcel of the 
books, and which, from their beauty, or skill, or humor, had often as great a share in their success as the 
text itself. Most of these books had colored illustrations, and they are here similarly given. 

This will be the first time that these famous books with their illustrations faithfully reproduced have 
been placed within easy reach of the public, and much interest in them is confidently anticipated.

A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL 

LITERATURE. 

n. 



Concluding our summary of the " Athe- 
naeum's " annual review of Continental litera- 
ture, we reproduce the leading features of the 
following reports : Holland, by Mr. H. S. M . 
van Wickevoort Crommelin ; Hungary, by Dr. 
Leopold Katscher ; Italy by Dr. Guido Biagi ; 
Poland, by Dr. Adam Belcikowski ; Russia, 
by Mr. Yalerii Briusov ; and Spain, by Don 
Rafael Altamira. We note with regret that 
both Norway and Sweden are missing from this 
year's review, as well as Greece, which also is 
usually included. 

Mr. van Wickevoort Crommelin, writing of 
Dutch literature, says : 

" The year has been most prolific both in promise 
and performance. Such healthy and vigorous books 
have not appeared for a long time. So varied are the 
divided army, obeying no sovereign command. They 
are indeed; there has never been more diversity, and 
ways of expression current among the writers of today 
that the complaint has been heard that theyjare a even an- 
tagonism of groups and personalities. But this only shows 
the strong individualism which everywhere abounds." 

The strength of the Dutch genius is in its ap- 
preciation of the beauty of common things, a 
fact which is illustrated by Dutch art and liter- 
ature alike. Mr. J. van Looy, who is both a 
painter and a man of letters, is the author of 
"Feesten," which "dwells on such humble 
topics as a party in a workman's cottage, fire- 
works, and popular amusements in the slums." 
Mr. Streuvels, in "Langs de Wegen," his last 
great work, tells "the story of a simple and 
lonely labourer who is everywhere elbowed 
out by a harsh world." Mr. Frans Coenen's 
" Zondagsrust " is " little more than the ac- 
count of a rainy Sunday passed by a family of 
three members." 

" The only novel in which a comprehensive plan is 
elaborated by a firm hand is Mr. Louis Couperus's 
' Boeken der Kleine Zielen.' Last year I just men- 
tioned the vast scheme of this book, two new volumes 
of which, ' Zielenschemering ' and ■ Het Heilige Weten,' 
have appeared. Here we meet with a woman who 
grows wearied of « society.' When Constance implores 
her influential brother-in-law, the minister Yan Naghel, 
to invite her to one of his official dinner parties in order 
to rehabilitate her in the eyes of the world, and to give 
her son a start in life, she suddenly becomes aware of 



112 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



the utter futility of her aspirations. She does not re- 
sort to suicide, as a French heroine might, but reforms 
her life and finds worthier ideals." 
A noteworthy play is " Gunlaug en Helga," by 
the Flemish poet, Mr. Victor de Meyere, which 
work, " although it has many good qualities, 
turned out to be rather an obsolete remnant of 
the romantic period." " Nieuwe Geboort," by 
Mrs. Roland Hoist, is " a political glorification 
of socialism." 

Dr. Katscher's Hungarian article opens with 
the following paragraph : 

"Fiction, already last year at a low ebb, has con- 
tinued so during the past twelvemonth. There are 
scarcely any really firstrate productions to be noticed, 
although some good ones have seen the light. Mr. 
M6r J6kai, our oldest man of letters, has brought out, 
after a few years' silence, an interesting novel entitled 
* Our Pole,' by which title he means a Polish Jew who 
is a half-legendary conqueror of hearts from the time 
of the Hungarian struggle for liberty. After a thrill- 
ing love affair with a proud and beautiful noblewoman, 
this man comes to a sad end. He sacrifices love and 
life to his faith. The background of the story is ro- 
mantic, humorous, and well constructed." 

" Ideals " is a political novel by Mr. Lajos 
Beck, a new man. It is a plea for socialism. 
" The King of Beasts at Large," by Mr. Istvan 
Barsony, is an animal story which has some 
points of resemblance to " The Jungle Books" 
of Mr. Kipling. Mr. Ferencz Herczeg is the 
most widely read of Hungarian writers at the 
present day. 

" His latest novel, ' Andrew and Andor,' is an ex- 
tremely ironical and satirical picture of contemporary 
Budapest society, an elegant and charming description 
of certain aspects of Hungarian journalism. In com- 
position it may not be regular, but the dialogue is 
highly spirited and the characterization excellent. Mr. 
Herczeg's newest play, too, is of a satirical turn. It is 
entitled ' Manus Manum Lavat,' and attacks nepotism, 
an evil terribly prominent in this country. This suc- 
cessful comedy exhibits many new sides of a brilliant, 
but somewhat frequently treated, subject." 

"Nero's Mother," by Mr. Victor Tardos, is a 
" grand tragedy " which " ranks higher than 
any Hungarian play performed for many years." 
In poetry, the year's output has been above the 
average ; noteworthy books are Mr. Sandor 
Feleki's " Shadows and Kays," and the "Verses " 
of Miss Renee Erdos, " full of true love, true 
psychology, and true poetry." Serious publi- 
cations include Professor Heinrich's " History 
of the World's Literature," to be the work of 
a number of specialists ; Professor Marczali's 
" Great Illustrated Universal History "; Mr. 
Ignacz Acsady's " History of the Magyar Em- 
pire "; Mr. Jozsef Fekete's " The Philosophy 
of Life"; and Mr. Mor Gelleri's "Social 
Questions of the Day." 



According to Dr. Biagi's account, the chief 
subjects of interest to Italians during the past 
year have been the Marconi telegraph and the 
fall of the Campanile — neither of them having 
any particular relation to literature. He says : 

" I heartily commiserate those who may have to 
write the history of Italian literature during the open- 
ing years of this century. They will find themselves con- 
fronted by an output so abundant, but at the same time 
so uniform, that few works will stand out, owing either 
to their form or to their contents, whilst of tbe mass 
the output itself, as much from the form as from the 
substance, is worthy of observation. It is a fact that 
during this last period great progress has been made. 
Whilst at first, by the side of works of excellence, due 
to a few writers of taste and of refinement, there sprang 
up laughable or pitiable literary abortions, now, if, in- 
deed, notable works are lacking, those also are scarce 
that excite contempt and disgust." 

The recent development of secondary teaching 
and the activity of the universities are influ- 
ences that are having very salutary results in 
the field of literature. The scientific impulse is 
giving way in large measure to the critical and 
artistic impulse. 

"Each of our faculties of letters is a workshop of 
studies where the history of literature and culture plays 
the predominant part. . . . Luckily a famous master, 
Giosue Carducci, showed by example that art and criti- 
cism were not two things in opposition; that on the 
contrary, one dwelt within the other; that if the taste 
was not educated one judged badly even of ancient 
works. So began with him and his disciples — to-day 
professors in many high schools — a salutary reaction 
against the analytical school and the purely corrosive 
criticism. Now the two tendencies balance each other 
and are intermingled, and the new generation has felt 
and understand that if history has its rights, art has 
too, and that serious criticism cannot take away from 
one or the other." 

The great writers are for the most part rest- 
ing on their laurels. " Signor Carducci has 
now bidden a final adieu to his muse ; Signor 
Fogazzaro is satisfied with his political in- 
fluence in his native Vicenza, where also he 
fills with great zeal the office of President of 
the Board of Charity ; Signor de Amicis has 
been silent for some time ; Signor Giacosa is 
directing a monthly magazine, the 'Lettura'; 
and Signor Guerrini is reprinting the ' Rime ' 
of Lorenzo Stecchetti." Signor d'Annunzio 
has a new trilogy in verse, " Laudi del Cielo, 
della Terra, del Mare, e degli Eroe," of which 
the first volume has appeared. Signor Pascoli 
has published the first volume of his " Canti di 
Castelvecchio." "These songs of his, exqui- 
site, perfect in form, express delicate thoughts 
drawn from pure wells of poetic inspiration." 
Other volumes of verse are "Verso l'Oriente," 
by Signor Orvieto ; "Patria Terra," by Signor

miati. 

" The Italian capital is now being formed and con- 
stituted in Rome, but all the elements that certainly 
are there have not yet been able to amalgamate and 
fuse into a single whole. The^ romance-writers who 
describe Rome of to-day speak of the black world and 
the white world, and someone has found there the yellow 
world — Signor Giustino Ferri, for example, who en- 
titled his romance ' Roma Gialla.' There are too many 
strident and discordant colours, too many currents of 
life in perpetual contrast. It is difficult to collect and 
represent in its true aspect a life so multiform. How- 
ever, whilst a really Italian romance and theatre have 
still to be looked for, there are first-rate representations 
of local life and customs." 

A Sardinian writer, Signora Grazia Deledda, 
has ** quickly sprung into great fame " with 
her romances, " Elias Portolu " and " Dopo il 
Divorzio." Other fiction includes " II Maleficio 
Occulto," by Signor Zuccoli ; " Oasi," by Sig- 
nor d'Ambra ; and "Dopo la Vittoria," by a 
new and promising writer who takes " Sfinge " 
for a pen-name. The theatrical successes of 
the year have been Signor Rovetto's " Roman- 
ticism " and Signor Martoglio's "Nica." Lit- 
erary productions of a more sober character 
include Signor Chiarini's "Memorie della Vita 
di Giosue Carducci," Signor Zumbini's "Studi 
sul Leopardi," Signor Turri's " Machiavelli," 
and Signor Bertano's " Vittorio Alfieri Stu- 
diato nella Vita, nel Pensiero, e nell' Arte." 
Dante has been, as usual, the subject of many 
publications, which run all the gamut from a 
magnificent illustrated edition of the M Com- 
media " to a series of Dante postal cards — 
one for each canto! The meeting at Rome 
last April of the International Historical Con- 
gress has given a marked stimulus to historical 
studies, and the history of art particularly has 
taken a renewed lease of life, as is attested by 
a long list of new works. 

Dr. Belcikowski's report from Poland may 
be very briefly summarized. The jubilee of 
Mr. T. T. Jez has led to the first publication 
in book form of his " Memoirs of a Suitor," 
one of his earliest and best romances. Other 
novels are " The Festival of Life," by the 
late A. Dygasinski ; " Rottenness," by Mr. W. 
Berent ; "On the Silver Sphere," the story of 
a journey to the moon, by Mr. J. Zulawski ; 
" In the Land of Rocks," by Mr. K. Przerwa- 
Tetmajer; "Chinese Tales," by Mr. W. 
Sieroszewski ; "Sword and Ell," by Mr. W, 
Gormolucki ; and three Napoleonic novels by 
Mr. W. Gonsiorowski. In lyric production, 
the " Poems " of Mr. G. Danilowski, " In the 
Twilight of the Stars," by Mr. T. Micinski ; 



» A Soul's Day," by Mr. L. Staff ; » To the 
Unknown," by Mr. W. Wolski ; and a volume 
of lyrics by Mr. A. Mironowski, are the most 
important books. The best plays of the year 
have been Mr. S. Wyspianski's M The Libera- 
tion" and "King Boleslaw the Bold," Mr. L. 
Rydel's " For Ever," and Mr. Gorczynski's 
" In a July Night," in which " a wealthy land- 
owner's fatal amour with a peasant girl is de- 
picted in vivid and brilliant colors." Mr. P. 
Chmielowski has written a " History of Liter- 
ary Criticism in Poland," and new editions have 
been published of the histories of Polish liter- 
ature by Professor A. Bruckner and Count S. 
Tarnowski. A sixth and concluding volume 
is soon to be added to the latter work. 

" The religious and philosophical movement 
which increases in Russia with every year has 
caused the appearance of a new monthly maga- 
zine" says Mr. Briusov, who furnishes the report 
from that country. It is called "The New Path," 
and its object " is to give opportunity for the 
expression, in whatever literary form it may 
be, of those new tendencies which have arisen 
in our society with the awakening of religious 
and philosophical thought. The new magazine 
aims at uniting the spirit of religious inquiry 
with sharply defined progress." Professor 
Merezhkovski, who represents this philosoph- 
ical tendency as distinctly as any writer, has an 
important article, giving his " views of a new, 
truly universal apocalyptic church, which will 
unite all Christian beliefs at present in ex- 
istence." The censorship has taken a hand in 
the matter, and the editors find their " new 
path " anything but an easy one. The pro- 
ductions of two young poets, Mr. Alexander 
Blok and " Andrei Bieli " also express these 
ideas, and "are strongly penetrated by a pas- 
sionate mysticism." The critic, Mr. A. 
Zalinski, — 

" Quite independently of these writers, has now for 
more than ten years been preaching idealism in Russian 
literature. . . . Three of his public lectures have been 
published under the title ' A Struggle for Idealism,' 
and have gone through two editions during the year 
with which we are dealing. ... In belles-lettres, 
' Maxim Gorki ' and Mr. L. Andrdev have continued 
to attract the most attention. Each of their new pro- 
ductions has evoked long and noisy discussions, both in 
the press and in society. The number of copies of their 
books which have been sold exceeds what has previously 
been known in Russia." 

" Gorki " has put upon the stage a new play 
called "In the Depths," and Mr. Andreev has 
published a number of striking tales in the mag- 
azines. One of them, " In the Mist," evoked 
a severe criticism from the Countess Tolstoy, 



114

[Sept. 1, 



who published a letter in which she found fault 
with the tale, and considered it likely to cor- 
rupt youth. She found some supporters in the 
press, but a great number of people defended 
Mr. Andreev, and reminded her that literature 
does not exist for the education of schoolboys. 
A vigorous polemic was carried on in the news- 
papers for about two months. Among writers 
of an earlier generation may be mentioned Mr. 
P. Boborykin, whose story "The Law of Life," 
devoted to the marriage question, is noticeable. 
We also mention "The Secret of Glaphira," 
by Mr. M. Aldov, and " Quite Gentle," by Mr. 
V. Korolenko, both important novels. 

" The supporters of the ' new poetry,' the ' modern- 
ists,' in the spring of the year of which we are treating, 
undertook a regular campaign in Moscow for the diffu- 
sion of their ideas. They have advocated them in public 
lectures and readings (of these the five lectures of Mr. 
K. Balmont, delivered in different places, were among 
the most conspicuous), and in public meetings on literary 
questions convened on Tuesdays by the Moscow Liter- 
ary and Artistic Circle. These Tuesdays attracted such 
a number of hearers that frequently the premises of the 
club could not contain them. The disputes became 
lively, and even violent. There were sharp conflicts 
between the representatives of opposite opinions." 

"Northern Flowers" is the title of an annual 
volume which represents the work of these 
" modernists." Mr. Ivanov's " Pilot Stars " is 
the work of a poet who has " an independent 
and original vocabulary." He " loves a word 
as some love precious stones. He polishes it 
carefully, chooses the suitable setting, and 
frequently makes it glitter with unexpected 
splendour." Professor Balmont is engaged 
upon a complete translation of Shelley, and 
many other important foreign works are being 
turned into Russian by various hands. 

" In the history of literature there has been much 
activity in what concerned Pushkin. Although more 
than sixty-five years have elapsed since his death, and 
during that period two such giants in Russian literature 
as Count Tolstoy and Dostoievski have been active, 
Pushkin maintains his vitality and influence upon his 
contemporaries. He is still the foundation upon which 
Russian literature stands. During the year under re- 
view two new editions of his works have been begun, 
and are being vigorously carried on." 

Important historical writings are a "History 
of Moscow," by Mr. T. Zabielin ; an " Intro- 
duction to the History of Greece," by Professor 
V. Buzeskul ; and a volume of " Essays on 
Russian History," by Professor S. Platonov. 
During the year, " the jubilee was celebrated 
of the literary activity of Count Tolstoy. With- 
out a dissenting voice all the press and all 
society unanimously saluted the great veteran. 
Such a jubilee also Mr. A. Pypin celebrated, 



the author of the most circumstantial ' History 
of Russian Literature.' On the occasion of 
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of 
Nekrasov, and the tenth of that of A. Fet, 
festivals were held in honour of these poets." 
Among the deaths of the year have been those 
of K. Staniukovich, who wrote stories of sailors, 
of Professor Kirpichnikov, the literary histo- 
rian, of E. Markov, the writer of travels, and 
of A. Aksakov, the spiritualist. 

Last in our list we come to Spanish litera- 
ture, of which Don Rafael Altamiro discourses 
at much length. 

" The twelve months that have elapsed since my last 
chronicle was writtten have been characterized by a 
decidedly interesting revival of literary activity, thus 
offering a curious contrast to the preceding twelve. In 
that period, coincidentally with what was taking place 
throughout the rest of the Continent, more especially 
in the Latin countries, there was remarked a certain 
indisposition on the part of authors to cultivate fiction 
and poetry, while the public evinced a decided weari- 
ness of, and distaste to, both those branches of liter- 
ature. Now there has ensued a rapid resumption of 
interest in both, and the production of tales and poems 
may be said, at least as far as numbers go, to be the 
most important that I have had occasion to speak of." 

The " Episodios Nacionales " of Senor Galdos 
have entered upon their fourth series, begin- 
ning with the year 1848. There are three new 
volumes, "Las Tormentas del 1848," "Nar- 
vaez," and "Los Duendes de la Carmarilla." 
Senor Valdes has written "Le Aldea Perdido," 
a tale addressed to his native Asturia. Senora 
Bazan has published " Misterio," following in 
the track of our Mrs. Catherwood in choosing 
for a subject the fate of the son of Louis XVI. 
A new "Biblioteca de Novelistas del Siglo 
XX." represents the younger novelists of to- 
day. " The most striking characteristic of the 
collection is the variety of styles, tastes, and 
tendencies expressed by the authors, which 
accentuate the individuality of each ; and the 
intellectual bearing of the problem that forms 
the predominant feature in most of them." 
The drama has been marked by a Catalonian 
revival, with several new pieces accompanied 
by much discussion. Plays of the year in Cas- 
tilian include " Pepita Reyes " and " La Dicha 
Ajena," by the brothers Quintero ; " Alma 
Triumpante " and " La Noche del Sabado," 
by Senor Benavente ; and " El Loco Dios " 
and " La Escalinata de un Trono," in which 
Senor Echegaray " repeats once more the 
splendours of his style and is again guilty of 
his customary defects." The first place among 
volumes of verse " belongs to a book called 
1 Musgo,' which is written by Senor Peres. 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



115 



Apart from his merit as a metricist and the 
intensity of his poetical inspiration, Senor 
Peres contributes to the Spanish Parnassus an 
original note — that of the feeling for nature — 
in a form which may be deemed novel among 
us, and which makes a profound impression 
on the reader." Two new volumes by the late 
Castalan poet Verdaguer have been published. 
A new author, Senor Galan, " has sung with 
deep feeling in 4 Extremenas ' the customs and 
the home of his native district."' Literary his- 
tory has been enriched by many writers, chief 
among them being Senor Menendez y Pelayo's 
" Tratado de los Romances Viejos," Don Juan 
Valera's critical essays entitled "El Superhom- 
bre," and Professor Farinelli's lecture on the 
influence of Spanish literature upon the rest 
of the world. Concerning books of erudition, 
the writer says : " The group of works refer- 
ring to social, philosophical, and political ques- 
tions, although limited, is of much interest. 
Three topics dominate it : the character of the 
Spanish people (both treated generally, and 
limited to one line of subjects), Spain's inter- 
national relations, and the regional agitation." 
The enumeration that follows gives us many 
titles, but they are mostly of exclusively Span- 
ish interest, and it is hardly worth while for 
us to reproduce them here, even in a selection, 
which, du reste, would be difficult to make. 



FREDERICK W. ROBERTSON. 



To no one do we so readily yield our confidence 
as to him who shows himself deeply read in the 
mysteries within as, who has penetrated where we 
believed Omniscience alone had access, and who 
reveals to as weaknesses that we had hardly dared 
to confess even in thought. Such a person, weep- 
ing our very tears, breathing our most secret hopes 
and aspirations, possesses the quality that above all 
others gives one mind power over another. When 
the living voice speaks to us in tones that betoken 
this initiation into the inmost recesses of our com- 
mon human nature, we hold our breath and listen 
as to a voice from heaven. When the printed page 
addresses the inner ear in the same accents, the 
marvel is greater still, — that one perhaps never 
seen and long sinee dead should lay open to our 
wondering gaze the hidden depths of our being, 
and show himself acquainted with thoughts and 
feelings we ourselves had never dared to pass in 
review. In such a person we recognize genius, and 
we exclaim, " Surely, never man spake like this 
man ! " 

Such was the secret of Frederick W. Robertson's 
power as a speaker, and it will also explain the en- 



during value and charm of his printed utterances. 
Warm-hearted and craving human sympathy, he 
exhibited that most perfect type of character which, 
as Martineau puts it, begins in beauty and ends in 
power ; which leans on the love of fellow-beings 
while it may, and, when it may not, stands upright 
in the love of God. Battling for the troth as he 
saw it, irrespective of sects and parties, and dying 
what may be called a .martyr's death, at the age 
of thirty-seven, Robertson of Brighton paid the full 
price, in loneliness and suffering, for the fair re- 
nown that is now his beyond the possibility of dis- 
pute. Fifty years have passed since he dropped 
his task, and, the victim of misunderstanding and 
abuse from all sections of the church, lay down to 
die in an agony of mental and physical torture that, 
even in the reading, and at this distance of time, 
wrings the very soul. The message he delivered to 
his generation is a message no less fitting for ours. 
From the torpor of material prosperity we cannot 
be too sharply aroused to a renewed sense of the 
things of the spirit. From an increasing tendency 
toward caste we need to be recalled to a feeling of 
the oneness of humanity. 

But it is more appropriate, in these pages, to 
dwell on the value of Robertson's published works 
as literature, — literature that sets the reader to 
thinking from its own depth of thought, and compels 
admiration from its beauty of style and conciseness 
of expression. While Robertson was called by Dean 
Stanley the greatest of modern English preachers, 
he has also been likened, as a letter-writer, to 
Cowper and to Eugenie de Gue*rin. His eight 
volumes of sermons and addresses, some of them 
many times republished, are still the delight of 
numerous readers in both England and America, 
while he is known through translations to a smaller 
body of admirers on the Continent. In his earnest- 
ness, his ardor, his power of mental analysis, and 
his apt, logical, and striking expression, lies the 
secret of his undying literary charm. The soldier 
blood that ran in his veins and all but determined 
his own career, often gave his utterances a martial 
ring that is indeed quickening. Wherever wrong 
seeks redress, his chivalrous and combative nature 
speak? out with impetuosity and vigor. But better 
than all else, his warm humanity and his marvellous 
insight into the mysteries of the human heart and 
soul infuse with life and meaning all that he has 
to say. When it is remembered that most of his 
addresses were published from imperfect notes 
either taken by others or jotted down afterward 
by himself, the wonder increases that they should 
still speak to us with so much of the eloquence of 
the living voice. 

Other personal qualities that add charm to his 
published works — we avoid the word writings — 
are a purity that administers words of withering 
rebuke to the unchaste, a passionate desire for 
perfection, an eagerness to sacrifice self for the 
good of his fellows, and, in general, an ardent de- 
votion to all high ideals. Although he began his 



116 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



fight against wrong by adopting the destructive 
method, by assailing iniquity and wrestling with 
sin, he soon pursued the wiser course of upbuilding, 

— of overcoming evil with good. This is expressed 
in the first of his "principles" of teaching, "the 
establishment of positive truth instead of the neg- 
ative destruction of error." The remaining five 
principles, though not bearing directly on his style, 
may be given in this connection, slightly abridged : 
" That truth is made up of two opposite propo- 
sitions, and not found in a via media between the 
two. That spiritual truth is discerned by the spirit, 
instead of intellectually in propositions, and there- 
fore should be taught suggestively, not dogmatic- 
ally. That belief in the human character of Christ's 
humanity must be antecedent to belief in his divine 
origin. That Christianity, as its teachers should, 
works from the inward to the outward, and not vice 
versa. The soul of goodness in things evil." 

Still more admirable does Robertson's style 
appear when the reader bears in mind that almost 
everything published from his spoken words was 
delivered extempore as to all but the main thoughts 
involved. His extraordinary facility in apt ex- 
pression and logical arrangement is traceable to his 
fine sense of rhythm and of order. Like many who 
have no ear for music, he was keenly sensitive to 
the melody of words harmoniously arranged. Yet 
he gave no conscious attention to style, but was 
thoroughly possessed by, as well as in possession of, 
his subject alone. Self-consciousness vanished, and 
when the sermon or lecture was over and the re- 
action came, he had forgotten, like a dream, words, 
illustrations, telling phrases, almost everything. It 
is curious to hear this born orator declare, in con- 
tempt of oratory, " I believe I could have become 
an orator, had I chosen to take the pains. I see 
what rhetoric does, and what it seems to do, and 1 
thoroughly despise it. I think it makes people 
worse instead of better ; exposes the feelings to 
tension, like the pulling constantly of a spring back, 
until the spring loses its elasticity, becomes weak, 
or breaks; and yet perhaps I do it injustice: with 
an unwordly noble love to give it reality, what 
might it not do ? " For an answer to this question 
we need only look to the example of the speaker 
himself. In modest disparagement of his own 
power in the pulpit and on the platform, he uses a 
striking image when he says of his hearers, " They 
watch by hundreds for my halting, and the mass 
of beings over whom I wield a temporary influence 
for a brief half-hour, are only chained by fluency, 

— held together as a column of sand is supported 
by the breath of desert wind. When that wind 
•ceases it resolves into its atoms again." In pictu- 
resque and forcible, almost too forcible, terms he 
expresses his admiration for Channing, and at the 
same time shows his own freedom from religious 
bigotry. A lady had betrayed her horror at find- 
ing on Robertson's table the recently published life 
of the famous Unitarian. " I told her," writes the 
English churchman to a friend, " that if she and I 



ever got to heaven, we should find Dr. Channing 
revolving round the central Light in an orbit im- 
measurably nearer than ours, almost invisible to 
us, and lost in a blaze of light ; which she has, no 
doubt, duly reported to the Brighton inquisition 
for heretics." Another and longer citation may be 
given, both for its substance and its form. Writing 
to a friend who was reading Alfieri's life, he says : 

"The misfortunes of genius, its false direction, its misery, 
I suppose rise partly from the fact of the life of genius heing 
that which is chiefly given to the world. Many a soldier died 
as bravely and with as much suffering as Sir John Moore at 
Corunna ; but every soldier had not a Wolfe to write his 
death-song. Many an innocent victim perished, — yes, by 
hundreds of thousands, — on the scaffolds of France, and in 
the dungeons of the robber barons, but they died silently. A 
few aristocrats whose shriek was loud have filled the world 
with pity at the tale of their sufferings. Many a mediocre 
boy have I seen spoilt at school, — many a commonplace des- 
tiny has been marred in life : only these things are not mat- 
ters of history. Peasants grow savage with domestic troubles, 
and washerwomen pine under brutal treatment : but the for- 
mer are locked up for burying their misery in drunkenness, 
— the latter die of a broken heart, with plenty of unwritten 
poetry lost among the soapsuds. I fancy the inarticulate 
sorrows are far more pitiable than those of an Alfieri, who 
has a tongue to utter them. Carlyle in this respect seems to 
me to hold a tone utterly diverse from that of the Gospel. 
The worship of the hero, that is his religion : condescension 
to the small and unknown, that is His ! " 

Hear him still once more, in his address to the 
Brighton working classes on " The Influence of 
Poetry." He is dissuading from the use of alcoholic 
stimulants. What he says has an autobiographic 
interest. 

" I know something myself of hard work ; I know what it 
is to have had to toil when the brain was throbbing, the mind 
incapable of originating a thought, and the body worn and 
sore with exhaustion ; and I know what it is in such an hour, 
instead of having recourse to those gross stimulants to which 
all worn men, both of the higher and lower classes, are 
tempted, to take down my Sophocles or my Plato (for Plato 
was a poet), my Goethe or my Dante, Shakspere, Shelley, 
Wordsworth or Tennyson ; and I know what it is to feel the 
jar of nerve gradually cease, and the darkness in which all 
life had robed itself to the imagination become light, discord 
pass into harmony, and physical exhaustion rise by degrees 
into a consciousness of power. I cannot, and I will not, believe 
that this is a luxury, or rather a blessed privilege, reserved 
for me, or my class or caste, alone." 

One is tempted to give further quotations, espe- 
cially from the delightful letters, as they are re- 
produced in Mr. Stopford Brooke's excellent life 
of Robertson. Pathetic indeed is it to read of the 
" azure demons " to which the writer is in constant 
danger of falling a prey ; amusing, as well as touch- 
ing, to find him exclaiming, " I wish I did not hate 
preaching so much, but the degradation of being a 
Brighton preacher is almost intolerable. ' I cannot 
dig, to beg I am ashamed.' " Of course it was not 
the being a preacher, but figuring as a popular 
preacher at a fashionable watering place, that he 
felt to be degrading. 

It may be well, in closing, to temper praise with 
candid criticism, and to caution the reader not 
to look for certain excellences in Robertson that 
are not to be found in him. Humor we search his 
pages for in vain ; he was too tremendously in 



1903.J

earnest. Bat in what leader of religion who is some- 
thing more than a popular preacher shall we find 
this quality ? Not in Calvin or Edwards or Chan- 
ning or Savonarola or Wesley or Fox. Robertson 
distinctly says that he rates Wordsworth none the 
lower for his lack of humor, a sense which he counted 
it folly to cultivate in himself when so many nobler 
qualities of mind and heart demanded nurture and 
training. He was by temperament irritable, im- 
petuous, given to exaggeration when deeply moved, 
and in his earlier years not free from intolerance. 
These defects he strove manfully to overcome, and 
at the last we find him singularly open to the truth 
from whatever source, and holding temporarily 
many of his own opinions in a state of suspension. 
The pity is that such capacity for endless growth 
and development should have come to so untimely 
an end, mortally speaking. But we may well be 
thankful for the volumes of his spoken and written 
words that still remain to us, and, together with his 
" Life and Letters," invite reperusal on this fiftieth 
anniversary (Aug. 15) of his lamented death.

IjIfe ajstd Letters of Sir George 
Grove.* 



Of Sir George Grove's noble labors in the 
service of Biblical research, and of the rich 
fruits which his labors have also borne in the 
annals of English music, no one can write ex- 
cept in terms of respect and admiration. The 
results of his studies proved more than a suffi- 
cient reward for years of earnest work. If Mr. 
Charles L. Graves's present biographical me- 
moir contains of necessity many more facts that 
are true than are new, let no one suppose the 
work is wanting in freshness or interest. Grove, 
though often urged to write his life, never did 
more than dictate, in 1897, a number of dis- 
cursive anecdotal reminiscences, filling a half- 
dozen copy-books. In addition to these, he left 
a quantity of autobiographical material in his 
letters, in the diaries kept during his tours in 
the Holy Land, in his speeches and addresses, 
and, above all, in the numerous little pocket 
note-books that he invariably carried about

Sir George Grove was born August 13, 1820, 
at London. He received but an ordinary school 
education, and at sixteen years of age was ap- 
prenticed to Alexander Gordon, a civil engi- 
neer, in which position his duties took him to

the continent, Jamaica, and Bermuda. In 1851 
he was married to Harriet Bradley, sister of 
George Granville Bradley, subsequently Dean 
of Westminster. Out of office hours music was 
his chief hobby. 

It was in 1854 that Grove made the acquaint- 
ance of Tennyson and Stanley. His admira- 
tion for the former was both deep and lasting ; 
later, he published some admirable studies of 
Tennyson's lyrics in " Macmillan's Maga- 
zine " — where under his editorship "Lucre- 
tius " first saw the light. But the introduction 
to Dean Stanley was far more momentous in 
its consequences. It not only brought Grove 
into contact with the man whom of all he ever 
knew he reverenced most highly, but it practi- 
cally determined the main course of his life for 
the next dozen years. The story of this is best 
told in an interesting autobiographical speech 
delivered by Grove in 1880. After giving 
various instances of the manner in which the 
turning-points in his career had been deter- 
mined by friends, he continued: 

"What was it that started me to the study of the 
Bible? I had been brought op to know the Bible well, 
bat the study of it was quite distasteful to me. What 
was it that altered my feeling? Why, the bitter com- 
plaint of James Fergusson (distinguished antiquarian 
and historian) that there was no index of the proper 
names of the Bible. He was engaged then in an inter- 
necine warfare with everybody who doubted his splen- 
did theory that the round church in Jerusalem — the 
Mosque of Omar — was the church which Constantine 
built over the tomb of our Lord — or what Constantine 
believed to be the tomb of our Lord. Fergusson and I 
used to meet at the Assyrian Court of the Crystal Palace 
and talk about many things, and this among them; and 
it was in one of these talks that he lamented that he 
could find no such list to support his argument. We 
set to work, ray wife and I, and made a complete index 
of every occurence of every proper name in the Old 
Testament, New Testament, and Apocrypha, with their 
equivalents in Hebrew, Septuagint Greek, and Latin. 
Soon after this came a great event in my life — I saw 
the Dean of Westminster (Dean Stanley) for the first 
time. It was while he was Canon of Canterbury, and 
he was just finishing ' Sinai and Palestine.' He showed 
me what he was then engaged on — the appendix. He 
showed me that in Hebrew there were distinct words for 
all the different kinds of natural objects — for moun- 
tains and hills, and rocks and plains — and that while 
in Hebrew these terms were never interchanged, in the 
English Bible they were used indiscriminately, and that 
a great deal of light might be thrown on the narratives 
if they were set right in our Bibles, and other things 
of the same sort rectified. He set me alight in a mo- 
ment, and I fairly blazed up. I rubbed up my Hebrew, 
of which I had learned the alphabet at Elwell's School. 
I got up German enough to plough through Ewald and 
Ritter, and plunged with delight into a sea of Biblical 
research." 

It was to Stanley that Grove owed his con- 



118 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



nection with the great " Dictionary of the 
Bible." Dr. William Smith, lexicographer, 
had already conceived the scheme of his greatest 
work. Stanley pointed out Grove as the best 
Old Testament theologian he knew ; and the 
zeal with which Grove threw himself into the 
work may be judged from a letter to Smith, 
dated Crystal Palace, January 16, 1857, in 
which he submitted a list of upwards of two 
hundred words and names in A and B alone. He 
visited Palestine twice — in 1858 and 1861 — 
so that his topographical and geographical 
articles might rest on the solid basis of close 
personal survey; and, according to his own 
account, he wrote no fewer than 1100 pages 
out of the 3154 contained in the Dictionary. 
Grove was engaged on this work for seven 
years; but during this period he contrived not 
only to prosecute his musical studies with great 
zeal, but to play a part in the organization of 
the musical performances of Crystal Palace far 
larger and more important than was demanded 
of him by the ordinary discharge of his duties 
as secretary. 

The origin of the analytical programmes 
which made Grove's name a household word 
amongst all friends of music, and endeared the 
familiar abbreviation of "G" to two genera- 
tions of concert-goers, dated from a Crystal 
Palace concert given to celebrate the birthday 
of Mozart in 1856. He says: 

*« I wrote about the symphonies and concertos because 
I wished to make them clear to myself, and to discover 
the secret of the things which charmed me so ; and then 
from that sprang a wish to make others see them in the 
same way." 

For upwards of forty years, Grove contrib- 
uted the lion's share of the analyses of 
these programmes, — those of the works of 
Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Schumann, 
and Brahms being with hardly an exception 
from his pen ; the analyses of the nine sym- 
phonies of Beethoven were eventually expanded 
into an important volume published in 1896. 
His work in this line was characterized by an 
enthusiasm, a charm of exposition, and a wealth 
of illustrative detail, that were all his own ; 
there may have been better analysts, anatomists 
and dissectors of the organism and structure of 
the classical masterpieces than " G," but there 
has never been so suggestive and stimulating 
a commentor upon their beauties. 

In 1865 Grove suggested a society for the 
systematic exploration of Palestine ; and in this 
way began the famous Palestine Exploration 
Fund, of which he was made secretary. In May, 



1868, after having acted as assistant editor to 
Professor David Masson for several months, 
Grove undertook the sole editorship of " Mac- 
millan's Magazine," to which he had been a 
contributor for fifteen years. With his wide 
range of interests, and his extensive acquaint- 
ance among the leading men of letters, science, 
and art, he was admirably fitted for the post ; 
and, while securing the cooperation of many 
writers of established repute, he was no fetish- 
worshipper of names, but was always on the 
alert to recognize unknown writers. In 1871 
Mrs. Humphry Ward made her debut in 
" Macmillan's," with a paper on " The Poem of 
the Cid." It was about this time that Grove's 
Saturday evening gatherings of intimates and 
notables became a weekly occurence of consider- 
able interest. The present Bishop of Lichfield 
gives a charming picture of these gatherings. 

"No one who has enjoyed the hospitality of Sir 
George and Lady Grove in their picturesque old wooden 
house in Lower Syndeuham can forget the delightful 
Saturday evenings when friends, and men of letters, 
and musicians would meet at the table of the Editor of 
' Macmillan's Magazine.' But however interesting and 
eminent the guests might be, it was the host who was 
the soul of the company. He literally bubbled over 
with anecdote, enjoying his stories as much as any 
member of the party. He was always ready at repartee. 
His humor was abundant, his versatility remarkable. 
There were few subjects upon which he could not dis- 
course; and he was able to produce his knowledge, not 
only without effort, but with a certain enthusiasm which 
enlisted the keen interest of all who heard him. There 
were quiet Sunday evenings as well, when he welcomed 
his more intimate friends, and held sweet converse with 
them on the highest and deepest subjects." 

In January, 1874, the prospectus of the 
" Dictionary of Music and Musicians " — per- 
haps the most notable of musical works, — the 
editorship of which was entrusted to Grove, 
was issued by the Messrs. Macmillan. Need- 
less to say, no editor ever entered on his task 
with greater enthusiasm or carried it through 
with more laborious industry. In speaking of 
his association with the Macmillan firm, Mr. 
George A. Macmillan says : " After all the 
' Dictionary of Music ' remains as a splendid 
monument of his work with us, and, apart from 
actual product, it was no small advantage to a 
publisher to have at hand a man of his keen 
literary sense and varied knowledge." 

Grove's visit to America, in 1878, was due 
to the realization of a long-deferred scheme on 
the part of Stanley. Grove was a keen observer, 
and Mr. Graves has given us many anecdotes 
of his trip in this country. He visited most of 
the great Eastern cities, was interested in all 
he saw, and met many of the leaders of thought 



1903.]

in the various States. A propos of his visit to 
Concord, he said : 

■ I am writing to you from Emerson's home at the 
end of a delightful day which I shall not easily forget. 
What is left of him is quite charming, and there is 
much left, though very much has gone. His memory 
has almost entirely fled, and he has to speak very slowly, 
and appeal to his daughter, not only for names of peo- 
ple and places, but for very ordinary words; but, on the 
other hand, his face is one of the most expressive and 
lovable I ever saw. He has been reading to us, for 
more than an hour, his own poems and things of Words- 
worth's and others. He says nothing worth remember- 
ing, but it is impossible not to carry away the image of 
the greatest goodness and sweetness. I have got a 
photograph of him, but it really gives no idea of the 
beauty of his face." 

A tangible recognition of Grove's services 
was shown in a testimonial, contributed by three 
hundred literary and musical friends, in the 
shape of a gold chronometer and a purse of a 
thousand guineas, presented to him in the ban- 
quet room of St. James Hall, July 19, 1880. 
Two years later he was offered the directorship 
of the Royal College of Music, at the urgent 
request of the Prince of Wales ; and during the 
years that he occupied this chair he labored 
industriously in the interest of music in the 
United Kingdom. In January, 1899, his 
strength began to fail, while his memory grew 
progressively worse ; he died May 28, 1900. 

In forming the present biography, the author 
has endeavored as far as possible to confine 
himself to autobiographical material placed at 
his disposal — to let " G " reveal himself with 
as little comment as possible. The pocket note- 
books kept by his subject, always full of inter- 
esting obiter dicta, are fully utilized. His 
habits, as was natural in a man who filled so 
many different posts in a long life, varied in 
accordance with the work on which he was en- 
gaged. One cannot but marvel at the amount 
of work he achieved in the domain of Biblical 
research, belles lettres, musical biography, and 
criticism, considering that he was not a scholar 
or a linguist or a technical musician. When 
a friend congratulated him on the high stan- 
dard attained by " Macmillan's Magazine," he 
replied : " To me the magazine is nothing but 
a monthly failure," explaining that he never 
succeeded in achieving his aim, which was not 
to please the initiated but to touch outsiders. 
As a traveller he confessed that he belonged to 
" that class which looks about in all directions, 
fascinated not only with the grand sights above, 
but also with some humble aspect of nature at 
their feet." 

We may add that the present biographer has, 



in a fascinating manner, achieved his aim,which 
was to give some notion of the man, his work 
and character, to those who never met him, as 
well as to refresh the affectionate memories of 
those who came within his sphere of influence.

different stages of his life, are reproduced in

The Physiological Effects of 
Alcohol.* 



The two substantial volumes containing a 
study of the " Physiological Aspects of the 
Liquor Problem" are the fourth of a series of 
reports on the Liquor Problem, by the Com- 
mittee of Fifty charged with the scientific in- 
vestigation of that perplexed and perplexing 
subject. "Like its predecessors," we are told, 
" this report is preliminary in its nature." It 
has been prepared by the sub-committee on 
the physiological and pathological aspects of 
the drink problem, and is edited by Dr. J. S. 
Billings. The book contains altogether ten 
reports, or essays, dealing with different mat- 
ters investigated by the sub-committee. All of 
these are full of valuable and interesting in- 
formation, and must be carefully studied to be 
appreciated. There are numerous summaries 
of the conclusions reached, but the perusal of 
these leaves an impression upon the mind which 
is colorless compared with that produced by 
reading the full details. In some cases the re- 
ports seem unduly lengthened by the narration 
of experiments which have to be dismissed as 
misleading or worthless ; but the sub-committee 
has thought it necessary to go into all these de- 
tails, because there is a whole forest of current 
errors to fell before daylight can be let in upon 
the subject. 

The first report in the book (after the gen- 
eral report of the sub-committee) is, rather to 
our surprise, pedagogical rather than physio- 
logical. It deals with the present instruction 
on the physiological action of alcohol, and is by 
Doctors H. P. Bowditch and C. F. Hodge. It 
mainly consists of a vigorous attack on what 
may be called the Black Bogie system of in- 
struction, as promoted by the W. C. T. U. 
After detailing the history of the movement,

and describing the character of the " author- 
ized" text- books on physiology, the writers say : 
" It is thus apparent that under the name of ' Scien- 
tific Temperance Instruction ' there has been grafted 
upon the public school system of nearly all our states 
an educational scheme, relative to alcohol, which is 
neither scientific, nor temperate, nor instructive" (p. 44). 

There are appended many letters from Amer- 
ican and European physiologists, most of them 
supporting the views of Messrs. Bowditch and 
Hodge in general, though the diversity of opin- 
ion and the general uncertainty as to many 
details are conspicuous. The following state- 
ments may be selected as illustrative. 

" In my opinion, alcohol is not a food, nor even a con- 
diment."— Dr. H. G. Beyer. 

" I believe that we have abundant evidence that al- 
cohol has a certain food value." — Prof. R. H. Chit- 
tenden. 

" I have also experienced the honor of an overdose 
[of alcohol], particularly when experimenting with 
whiskey in association with the late Dr. Anstie. I can 
think of nothing more disagreeable than the effort to 
make observations on one's self when half poisoned. 
But I quite agree with you that, notwithstanding, al- 
cohol is not a poison, as well as with your definition of 
a poison as a thing which can only do harm and never 
good." — Sir. J. Burdon Sanderson. 

" Physiology as an experimental science not only has 
not, but I think never will decide whether the moderate 
use of alcohol is good or bad." — Prof. P. H. Pye-Smith. 

" Alcohol is a poison and not a food." — Prof. A. Forel. 

After perusing these and many other like state- 
ments, the reader may be excused for feeling 
a little bewildered. The fact is, that, as in 
so many heated discussions, the chief things 
needed are common-sense and an agreement as 
to terms. In the second volume, Professor 
Atwater, after describing his numerous and 
elaborate investigations, concludes thus: 

" If we define food as that which, taken into the body, 
either builds tissue or yields energy, alcohol is food, but 
it is a very one-sided food. If we confine the word 
food to materials which, like bread and meat, contain 
protein and build nitrogenous tissue, alcohol is not a 
food; neither is starch, which is the chief constituent of 
such food materials as wheat, corn, rice, and potatoes " 
(p. 314). 

Practically, alcohol is not useful as a food-stuff 
under ordinary conditions ; though in certain 
forms of disease it may so serve. 

As to whether alcohol is a poison, the con- 
tradictory statements of Sir J. Burdon Sander- 
son illustrate the futility of the definition which 
he approves. Elsewhere in the book it is clearly 
pointed out that the most poisonous substances 
may be harmless or beneficial in certain small 
quantities. Hydrochloric acid is a normal con- 
stituent of the gastric juice ; and yet if some- 
one swallows a quantity of that substance, and 
dies in consequence, are we forbidden to say 



that he is poisoned ? That alcohol in any other 
than very moderate quantities has a genuinely 
poisonous action is apparent from the numer- 
ous experiments detailed by Dr. J. J. Abel in 
the second volume. The last mentioned writer, 
in his long report on the Pharmacological Action 
of Ethyl Alcohol, raises some very interesting 
questions. It appears that the supposed stimu- 
lating effect of alcohol may have been quite 
misunderstood. Dr. Abel quotes James as 
saying : 

" We should all be cataleptics, and never stop a con- 
traction once begun, were it not that other processes 
simultaneously going on inhibit the contraction. Inhi- 
bition is, therefore, not an occasional accident; it is an 
essential and unremitting element of our cerebral life " 
(p. 131). 

Now alcohol, by deadening down inhibitory in- 
fluences, may give certain positive reactions a 
free field, and the result is an apparent stimu- 
lation. Thus : 

" In speaking of a certain type of individual James 
says, ' It is the absence of scruples, of consequences, of 
considerations, the extraordinary simplification of each 
moment's outlook, that gives to the explosive individual 
such motor energy and ease.' This description aptly 
applies to the individual who is under the influence of 
a ' moderate ' quantity of alcohol. It tends to turn the 
inhibitive type of mind into the ' hair-trigger ' type" 
(p. 141). 

Suppose a horse to be pulling a heavy load. 
It moves forward slowly and painfully ; but all 
at once the tugs break, and the animal runs off, 
kicking up its heels. Superficially, it might 
seem that there had been a sudden stimulus, 
and that the active gyrations indicated an in- 
crease in the amount of work done. So often 
in the case of persons affected by alcohol. 

The experiments on dogs and rabbits, illus- 
trated by photographs, cannot be properly 
described here. The influence of alcohol in 
producing fear is most significant, as also are 
the effects upon the vitality of the young born 
to alcoholized dogs, and the increased suscepti- 
bility to disease induced by chronic alcoholism. 

Dr. Billings has compiled data relating to the 
use of alcoholic drinks among brain-workers 
in the United States. It appears that of 892 
cases, 18.7% were total abstainers, 64.9% oc- 
casional drinkers, and 16.3% regular moderate 
drinkers. The number of regular drinkers is 
thus quite small ; the " occasional drinkers " 
ought, no doubt, mostly to be classed with the 
abstainers, as the majority of those who do not 
ordinarily use alcohol will drink a little on 
special occasions, and thus could not put them- 
selves down as total abstainers.

Use of 'Temperance Drinks,'" is sandwiched 
in between discussions of the nutritive and 
pathological effects of alcohol, and is likely to 
be overlooked. It appears that practically all 
the tonics and bitters sold in drug-stores con- 
tain alcohol, and many of them very, large 
quantities. So " it is clear that very large 
quantities of drinks containing a greater per- 
centage of alcohol than the ordinary wines and 
beers are consumed among the most rigorous 
of total abstinence circles, and one of the fore- 
most advocates of total abstinence has permitted 
her picture to be used as an advertisement of 
one of the most alcoholic of these drinks" 
(p. 345, vol. 2). The percentage of alcohol by 
volume in some of the drinks mentioned is as 
follows: Paine's Celery Compound. 21 ; Ayer's 
Sarsaparilla, 26.2 ; Golden's Liquid Beef 
Tonic, " recommended for treatment for alco- 
hol habit," 26.5 ; Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, 
44.3 ; Boker's Stomach Bitters, 42.6 ; and so 

forth : T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



The Marshall Memorial.* 



By the timely action of the American Bar, 
immediately after the death of Chief Justice 
John Marshall in 1835, a fund was provided 
which, with its accretions, was in 1882 so sup- 
plemented by the favorable action of Congress 
as to suffice to present to the country, in 1884, 
a noble monumental portraiture of " the great 
Chief Justice," for the embellishment of the 
grounds fronting the Capitol at Washington. 
Visitors to these classic grounds have thus be- 
fore them an outward reminder of the lofty 
career of this devoted public servant. 

On February 4, 1901, occurred the centen- 
nial of the advancement of this profound jurist 
to be the head of the federal judiciary ; and 
this was made the occasion for erecting another 
monumental tribute to his personal worth and 
his distinguished services. The day having been, 
by pre-arrangement, set apart as " John Mar- 
shall Day," public exercises were held in nearly 
all the States of the Union, in commemoration 
of the event which opened up a great career a 
hundred years previously. Able and eloquent 
speakers, as with one voice, sought to place 
Marshall on the pedestal of his just fame. It

was a happy thought to gather together in type 
these manifold tributes of esteem and rever- 
ence, and preserve them permanently in com- 
pendious volumes, for the information and 
delectation of millions of American citizens. 
The monument at Washington points every 
visitor to the Capitol to the inestimable work of 
Marshall as an artificer of the national common- 
wealth. The devoted efforts of the American 
Bar have now erected, in every library in the 
land, a monument equally worthy and equally 
enduring, bringing a like appreciation of the 
great Chief Justice to the mind of every reader 
of our history, the home-dweller and the trav- 
eller alike. 

Much of the significance of this testimonial 
to the character and the virtues of Marshall 
lies in the unanimity of sentiment disclosed by 
the speakers who voiced his praise on this an- 
niversary. When he was appointed Chief 
Justice, a century ago, partisan politics were 
at a white heat. In their bitterness they sought 
to invade the judicial bench, and the new ap- 
pointment wore in part the guise of a partisan 
move. But such partisanship as was involved 
in it has been justified ; for, irrespective of the 
President's motive, the fitness of the appoint- 
ment he made has long been unquestioned, and 
has won the praise of many whose party affili- 
ations made them reluctant to commend. The 
man whom the opening of the nineteenth cen- 
tury saw maligned and stigmatized is now, at 
the opening of the twentieth century, apotheo- 
sized. From all sections of the Union alike, 
from all the learned professions and from all 
political parties, arise eloquent speakers who 
vie with each other in wreathing garlands for 
the name and fame of Marshall. 

These orations and addresses are monumen- 
tal in their extent and their quality, as well as 
in their unanimity. They emanate from thirty- 
eight different states and territories, in some of 
which there were gatherings in several places ; 
they are the voices of the leaders of the bar 
and the community, including the present 
Chief Justice and two of his associates on the 
Supreme Bench, and of clergymen, professors, 
and statesmen ; and they fill three noble vol- 
umes, aggregating upwards of fifteen hundred 
pages. Though the central feature in all of 
these various sketches of Marshall is the jurist, 
yet this feature is not developed out of due 
proportion ; Marshall the man, the patriot, the 
citizen, and the statesman, are held in view ; 
and the result is a well-rounded and sympa- 
thetic portrait of a most engaging character.

So it will not be the legal student alone, nor 
yet the professional lawyer, but the American 
citizen in every walk of life, and the general 
reader as well, who may at convenience dip 
into these volumes, sure of finding therein 
congenial and entertaining reading. 

It would be impracticable to give in this re- 
view either fair samples of the matter of these 
discourses or any adequate description of their 
substance or merits. That there is, through- 
out their entire course, generous panegyric of 
Marshall, may go without saying. Let it suf- 
fice here to note that the burden of all this 
wealth of encomium is the inestimable work of 
Marshall in giving life and force, by judicial 
action from time to time, to the provisions of 
the American Constitution. The process of 
vivification of that once feeble document was 
not only necessary to its survival, but was an 
absolutely essential condition of its develop- 
ment and expansion. All that the United 
States has become, in vigor, activity, and 
beneficence, has been due to its Constitution. 
That this Constitution has been vital and en- 
ergetic, and not formal and lifeless, must be 
ascribed to the wise and comprehensive work 
of the Supreme Court ; and it was Marshall 
who opened up the career of that Court in its 
great usefulness. The fathers had drawn with 
fine skill the provisions of the Constitution, 
assigning a leading and important part of the 
work of government to the Federal judiciary. 
A strong and fearless Supreme Court was 
needed to put into operation that judiciary as 
the balance-wheel of the intricate system. It 
was fortunate that the Hour and the Man met, 
when Marshall was assigned to preside over 
this Court; for it is he whom all now concur in 
describing as " born to be the Chief Justice of 
any country in which Providence should cast 
his lot." The details of the character of his 
constructive work, and its relation to the la- 
bors of the early fathers, are perspicuously and 
instructively recounted by his enthusiastic en- 
comiasts of "Marshall Day." Here speaks in 
dulcet tones the gratitude of one republic, giv- 
ing specific reasons for its appreciation of faith- 
ful public service. 

This collection of orations and addresses has 
been issued under the able editorship of Judge 
John F. Dillon, who was himself one of the 
"Marshall Day" speakers, and has furnished 
an appropriate and scholarly introduction to 
the compilation. The volumes are well illus- 
trated, a view of the tasteful Marshall monu- 
ment at Washington being presented, together 



with copies of three fine portraits of the Chief 
Justice. Appended to the collection are repub- 
lications of the eulogies pronounced by Horace 
Binney and Judge Joseph Story on the occa- 
sion of the death of Marshall in 1835, the 
inspiring address of Edward J. Phelps given 
in 1879 as a tribute to Marshall's memory, and 
the oration delivered by William Henry Rawle 
at the unveiling of the monument at Washing- 
ton in 1884. Thus has been woven together 
a " Marshall Anthology." 

Mr. Phelps summed up the value of Mar- 
shall's life-work by saying, with entire truth, 
that " it is upon the entrusting to the judicial 
department of the whole subject of the con- 
stitutional law, for all purposes, that our 
government rests " ; and he added that the 
wonderful success of the system which em- 
bodies that principle "is more largely due to 
Chief Justice Marshall than to any other man, 
or perhaps to all other men, who ever had 
anything to do with it," Herein lay the occa- 
sion and the justification of a Marshall centen- 
nial anniversary ; and Judge Dillon, in his 
Introduction to these volumes, felicitously says 
that " among the chief lessons of ' Marshall 
Day ' is the revelation of the public as well as 
the professional consciousness that the Supreme 
Court is, verily, the living voice of the Con- 
stitution ; and that it is such is due preemi- 
nently to Chief Justice Marshall." 

It is a pleasure to welcome this Marshall 
Memorial as a substantial contribution to the 
historical collections of the United States. It is 
an additional pleasure to note the announce- 
ment in these volumes, that the publishers 
" have arranged to issue, uniform with the 
present work, an edition of Marshall's con- 
stitutional decisions and writings, annotated, 
with the assistance of the present editor, by 
George S. Clay and John M. Dillon of the

of the " Letters of Horace Walpole," edited by Mrs. 
Paget Toynbee, will be ready in November. Mrs. 
Toyubee has obtained the use of over 400 letters not 
included in the latest edition of the collected letters, 
and upwards of a hundred of these have never before 
been printed. A careful collation of the text with the 
original MSS. has revealed many curious and interest- 
ing passages hitherto suppressed, and also many serious 
errors in transcription. The notes, except those written 
by Horace Walpole himself, have been compiled anew 
by Mrs. Toynbee, who has also prepared a very full 
analytical index. This new edition, to be complete in 
sixteen volumes, will be illustrated with fifty photo- 
gravure portraits of Walpole and his circle, and with 
facsimiles.

Recext Poetry.* 



When a man whose chosen vehicle is prose under- 
takes to write verse, we are apt to look askance at 
the effort and to regret its misdirection. Bat a 
strong writer is worth listening to, even when he 
expresses himself through an unwonted medium ; 
and the occasional verse of a prosateur often has 
qualities of strength and sincerity that are not 
always found in the writings of the poets by pro- 
fession. From such a source we hardly expect lyr- 
ical treasure-trove, but we may have vigorous and 
suggestive imagery, and other of the elements of 
poetic art. The verses of Mr. Thomas Hardy, for 
example, with all their limitations and defects, 
proved a genuine and pleasurable surprise ; and 
something similar may be said of the volume into 
which Mr. Lecky collected his scattered verses sev- 
eral years ago. Mr. Zangwill, as his readers know, 
has occasionally mingled verses with the contents 
of his prose books, and hence we are not surprised 
to find that his activities in this sort have been 
sufficient to furnish forth a volume of respectable 
dimensions. He calls his poems " Blind Children," 
for 

" Are they not verily 

Blind Children, one and all ; 

Wistfnlly haunted by 

That unattainable 

Glamorous sea of light 

True poems float within ? " 

The opening piece is a new version of the old 
theme beautifully dealt with by Schiller in "Die. 
Gotter Griechenlands." It ends with this stanza: 

" The nymphs are gone, the fairies flown, 
The olden Presences unknown, 
The ancient gods forever fled, 
The stars are silent overhead, 
The music of the spheres is still, 
The night is dark, the wind is chill, 
The later gods have followed Pan, 
And Man is left alone with Man." 

The succeeding piece takes this last verse for a text, 
and sermonizes upon the theme " At the Worst," 
reaching this conclusion :

" Evil is here ? That's work for ua to do. 
The Old is dying f Let 's beget the New. 
And Death awaits us ? Rest is but our due." 

This seems to be the only gospel left us after the 
passing of the mythologies, but it is not without its 
inspiration. "Love's Bubble" is an exercise in 
one of the artificial forms so favored of late by 
rhymsters of every degree, and it comes near to 
having the charm of a true lyric. 

" If Love be but a bubble, 

Blown from the pipe of Life, 
That bursts and leaves but trouble 

And weariness and strife, 
Then who would cares redouble 
And leave his years as stubble 

And Sorrow take to wife ? 
If Love be but a bubble 

Blown from the pipe of Life. 

" If Love be but a bubble 

Blown from the pipe of years, 
Its beauty is but double 

That it is built of tears, 
And for its tender trouble 
I 'd leave my life as stubble 

And pluck my ripest ears, 
Thongh Love be but a bubble 

Blown from the pipe of years." 

A touch of sardonic humor now and then finds its 
way into Mr. Zangwill's verses, as in his description 
of " The ..Esthete's Damnation." The aesthete finds 
Hell a very satisfactory place. 

" Such subtle sinuous flare, 
Such restful red unrest. 
Half shadow and half glare, 
Like Rembrandt at his best. 

" And while the light is ruddy, 
And while my zeal is hot, 
Oh what a chance to study 
My Dante on the spot ! " 

But these reflections are rudely interrupted, for 

" Then Satan grimly swore : 
I damn you np to heaven. 
Where you HI find life a bore, 
And a day as long as seven. 

" Where the souls sit round and purr 
O'er each soporific blessing, 
Where the music 's amateur. 
And the art is life-depressing." 

Mr. Zangwill comes nearest to being a poet when 
he is inspired by his own racial instincts. From 
the group of poems upon Jewish motives we select 
this striking sonnet on " Moses and Jesus " : 

" Methought on two Jews meeting I did chance — 
One old, stern-eyed, deep-browed, yet garlanded 
With living light of love around his head ; 
The other young, with sweet, seraphic glance. 
Round them went on the Town's Satanic dance, 
Hunger a-piping while at heart he bled. 
Salom Aleikhem mournfully each said, 
Nor eyed the other straight, but looked askance. 

"Sudden from Church outrolled an organ hymn, 
From Synagogue a loudly chanted air, 
Each with its Prophet's high acclaim instinct. 
Then for the first time met their eyes swift-linked 
In one strange, silent, piteous gaze, and dim 
With bitter tears of agonized despair." 

We should like to quote also from " The Hebrew's

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Friday Night," and from " Yom Kippur," but our 
space forbids. 

It was about twenty years ago that we first saw 
a volume of verse by Mr. Rennell Rodd. At that 
time Oscar Wilde was enjoying his brief vogue as 
a poet, and our chief impression of the new writer 
was that he had taken Wilde for a model and pro- 
duced a rather poor imitation. But Mr. Rodd had 
staying qualities, for he has kept on producing verse 
of winning mien, and has grown in grace as a poet 
during the period that has also witnessed his rise as 
a diplomatist. He is now Sir Rennell Rodd, with 
numerous volumes to his credit, besides a distin- 
guished record in the foreign service. " Myrtle and 
Oak " is the title of a volume of poems which Sir 
Rennell has selected for special publication in Amer- 
ica ; a few of the pieces are new, but most of them 
may be found in his earlier volumes. The collection 
is charmingly introduced by an " Envoi " which 
bids the poet's song 

" Go through that greater England 
The years have reconciled, 
And touch the kindred blood that flows 
Through mother as through child ! 

" And say to that new England 
For you, too, were we sung. 
And in your heart the note must be 
To which our strain is strung ! 

"And greet me that great England 
My feet have never trod. 
Whose heroes are our heroes 
And whose God must be our God." 

The influence of both Browning and Tennyson is 
strongly marked in this volume, the author having 
been inspired by the passion of the one and the 
felicity of the other. It is felicity rather than 
passion that he himself achieves, as may be illus- 
trated by the very lines in which he pays tribute to 
the poet supreme among his contemporaries : 
" Singer of England's saga, back to the misty prime, 
Rolling a morning glamour over the night of time ; 

" Singer of English gardens, poet of English springs, 
Lover of earth's dear beauty, and all elemental things. 

" Never a girl in England, or in England over the sea, 
But wakes to her life's first love-dream sweetlier-sonled 
for thee. 

" Never a boy's young life-blood thirsts for the dawn of deeds, 
But it throbs to a nobler impulse as he turns thy roll and 
reads." 

If Sir Rennell does not achieve the expression of 
passionate emotion, he is a master of tender senti- 
ment setto flowing and graceful melody. What could 
be more exquisite in its way than this simple stanza : 

" Where did you learn that music ? For it drew 
My dreaming back down autumn paths of years, 
Touched chords long silent and forgotten tears, 
Recalled dim valleys where dead violets grew, 
Soothed me with twilight, as it were it knew 
The very secret of my heart and sighed 
For sympathy, and when at last it died 
It seemed as if my soul were singing too." 

Almost every poem in the volume tempts us to 
quotation, as we linger fondly over the lovely im- 
agery and noble idealism of the pages. What space 



yet remains to us shall be given to extracts from 
Sir Rennell's "Credo," at once the longest and the 
loftiest of his poems. It is a work almost worthy 
to be spoken of in the same breath with Mr. Swin- 
burne's " Hymn of Man " and with the prophetic 
utterances of Tennyson's last years. 

"Turn, turn from the cave's dark hollow! look up to the 
light and see, 
Though thine eyes be dazed in the glory, the man that is 
yet to be ! 
" Time's wings are at pause beside him, and calm is his heart's 
strong beat, 
And the dust of these old dominions is flowerful round his 
feet. 
"Exult, we have won the midway, and the light has scared 
the gloom, 
And we smile at the old sad sentence, we are freed from the 
endless doom. 

" The arms of the dawn are reaching to gather the mist away, 
And your star that the hill-peaks harbored grows dim in 
the rose of day. 
" I can see as it were in a vision the fullness of day unroll, 
And the light of the sunrise cresting the hills with its 
aureole. 
" First red in the sky at dawning, wild cloud and the bode of 
storm, 
But the winds are hushed and the clouds dispart for the 
feet of a queenly form. 
"On her brows is a crown of olive, her arms are outstretched 
afar, 
She is robed in a rainbow's glory, and each of her eyes is a 
star. 
" The sword that she bears is broken, the arc of her wings is 
furled, 
She is throned on the ancient mountains, and her smile goes 
over the world." 

There is no lack of virile energy in the poems of 
Mr. Henry Newbolt, whose stirring ballads of En- 
glish fighting by sea and land have thrilled many 
patriotic hearts, making them stouter in their love 
of country and prouder in the emprise of its heroes. 
From Mr. Newbolt's new volume, " The Sailing of 
the Long-Ships, and Other Poems," we take this 
song of Sir Francis Drake : 

" Drake in the North Sea grimly prowling, 
Treading his dear Revenge's deck, 
Watched, with the sea-dogs round him growling, 
Galleons drifting wreck by wreck. 
' Fetter and Faith for England's neck, 
Fagot and Father, saint and chain, — 
Yonder the Devil and all go howling, 
Devon, O Devon, in wind and rain ! ' 

" Drake at the last off Nombre lying, 

Knowing the night that toward him crept, 
Gave to the sea-dogs round him crying 
This for a sign before he slept : — 
' Pride of the West ! What Devon hath kept 
Devon shall keep on tide or main ; 
Call to the storm and drive them flying, 
Devon, O Devon, in wind and rain.' 

"Valor of England, gaunt and whitening, 
Far in a South land brought to bay, 
Locked in a death-grip all day tightening, 
Waited the end in twilight gray. 
Battle and storm and the sea-dog's way ! 
Drake from his long rest turned again, 
Victory lit thy steel with lightning, 
Devon, Devon in wind and rain ! "

THE DIAL,

Mr. Newbolt has advanced in his art since " Ad- 
mirals All " took the public by storm. A grave 
elegiac note has found its way into his song, and 
becomes it exceedingly. 

To "The Silence of Love" succeeds — some- 
times — u The Triumph of Love "; and Mr. Edmond 
Holmes, having voiced the one in an earlier volume, 
now sings the other in a new cycle of sixty-four 
Shakespearian sonnets. The song is worthy of the 
theme, grave and tender, richly emotional, and not 
ostentatiously exultant. We select for quotation 
the twentieth of the series. 

M I love thee less that I may love thee more : 

The refluent wave rolls in with larger sweep, 
And surging up the half-abandoned shore 

Wins a new margin for love's restless deep. 
I love thee less that love may rest his wing 

In drooping circles ere he soar anew, 
Ere be ascend in spiral airy ring. 

To pass from sight into the pathless blue. 
I love thee less that love may be re-born. 

That I may feel the breeze blow fresh and cold. 
May breathe once more the fragrance of the morn. 

May see once more the streaks of green and gold : — 
I love thee less that out of love's dark night 

May break the dawn efa^divhier light." 

" The Oceanides " is a volume of poems and 
translations by Mr. Percy W. Shedd that offer 
much food for reflection. The titular poem is a 
trifling lyric that suddenly breaks into German, and 
represents the Oceanides as scorning the race of 
mortals. 

" Du Sterblicher. was machst Du hier? 

Get heim ! zur tick ! 

Fur Dich zu salzig ist das ' Meeral ' Bier, 

Der Wallfischschnitt zu dick." 

On a later page we find a bit of translation that 
begins as follows : 

" Twilight o'er forest is fallende : 
Over the lakes softly sleepende, 
Over the reeds . . . wild birds callende . . . 
Over the copse it comes creepende." 

The mystery of these participles is explained when 
we say that the translation is from the Danish, and 
that the translator has thus sought to naturalize in 
English the Danish orthography. The same sort 
of freakishness is illustrated many times in the 
author's original verse ; it is not offensive, but 
it is certainly odd. That Mr. Shedd can give us 
serious poetry, in spite of his whims, is a fact dis- 
covered early in the volume, and enforced by many 
examples. One of the finest of them is suggested 
by the last words of the late Cecil Rhodes, and this 
we quote in full, despite its length. 

*' So much to do, so little done : 
The old myopic rune doth run ; 
As though the stars, the sea. the sun. 
Were much concerned at what was done. 

" Life's day is brief, and Art is long : 
Another slumber-banning song ; . . . 
But Nature smiles, and builds a flow'r. 
Whose life is one long sentient hour, 
Whose root winds through the hollow eyes 
Of some brave mortal past surprise ; 
And yet the flow'r is passing fair, 
Though Art had no dominion there. 



" The gods are good ! They drift the sand 
Across the proud Assyrian land ; 
The gods are good ! Their floods are sent, 
And great Atlantis' head is bent ; 
The gods are good ! Their ice-streams creep, 
And where was life, is death and sleep. 
Ye mighty gods, oh grow not pale 
If some vain mortal groan and wail : 
So much to do ! So much to do ! 
The hour hath come ! I'm not half through. . . . 
Oh wait, ye gods. . . . 

" Nay, let him mark the calm deep glance, 
The sternly gentle countenance 
That sayeth : Live thy little day, 
A part for work, a part for play. 
The cell hath birth, the cell doth live. 
And then to death the cell I give ; 
Thereof new forms and strange I build, 
The crystal rock with gold I gild, 
The flow'r with honey have I filled, 
Unto the glow-worm light I lend. . . . 
I gave thee life that thou mightst wend 
Thy little way ; ... be not afraid. 
Of thee yet something shall be made. 
But whether zoon or pearl or worm 
My great decree doth not confirm. 
Thou nor thy work shall go to waste ; 
Naught in my realm is e'er displaced. 
Be calm, and to thy life be true ; 
Thus only payest thou thy due." 

Mr. Shedd's poems include other pieces that will 
reward the attention almost as richly as the one 
just quoted, and some sort of striking quality, be- 
tokening a genuine individuality on the part of the 
writer, may be found upon nearly every page. But 
we must now turn to his translations, which are also 
remarkable, and which make up a full half of his 
collection. These translations are from many lan- 
guages, Russian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, 
Dutch, German. French, Italian, Spanish — even 
Finnish and Persian. They are mostly of unfa- 
miliar matter, although now and then the transla- 
tor tries his hand at the old problems. Here, for 
example, is the song of Raphael in " Faust '": 

" The sun sings joyous as of eld ; 

The spheres antiphonal reply ; 
In circling course forever held. 

He rolls in thund'ring majesty. 
Archangels gaze and gather strength, 

Though fathomless the great design ; 
God's works throughout creation's length 

In pristine splendor rise divine." 

This is almost as good as Shelley, and it is at the 
same time rather closer to the original text. Mr. 
Shedd's gifts as a translator are indeed remarkable, 
and we are grateful for the many lyric jewels from 
foreign tongues that he has put into musical En- 
glish. Most of all are we grateful for his transla- 
tions of the poems of Dr. Ibsen. These versions 
are scattered all along through the volume, and not 
until we approach the close do we realize that Mr. 
Shedd has translated practically the whole of Dr. 
Ibsen's slender volume of poems. All the great 
pieces are here — " Terje Vigen," " Abraham Lin- 
coln's Mord," '• Paa Vidderne," and the others — 
and nearly all of the minor ones as well. And they 
are better done, for the most part, than we could

have thought possible. The version of " Terje 
Vigen " is a masterpiece of translation, and for the 
first time that extraordinary poem is put in such a 
form as really to convey to the English reader an 
adequate notion of its fire, its pathos, and its poetic 
beauty. If Mr. Shedd had done nothing more than 
this, he would deserve our heartfelt thanks. 

Magazine verse is a fair description of Mr. H. 
Arthur Powell's "Young Ivy on Old "Walls." It 
exhibits the peculiar type of mediocrity that seems 
to be in favor with all but two or three of the 
popular monthlies, being conventional and without 
salient characteristics. " Death and Derision " is a 
good example. 

" Love have I tasted, and its daring bliss 
Hath bid me chant defiance to the storm. 
Once, cast ashore before the foiled wave's hiss, 
Beneath cold flesh my heart was bold and warm. 

" Wine have I drunk, with perfect throat of youth ; 

The grape's blood flowed with mine the veiny maze ; 
With quickened sense my body glowed, in truth, 
Like startled Dian's 'neath Action's gaze. 

" Joys fugitive, joys fugitive replace — 

All that to youth's fair heritage belong ; 
Perhaps the purest, after fight or chase, 

To swoon in Music's arms, or live with Song. 

" At last, at close of some fierce, bloody strife, 

Powers above ! — when painful comes the breath, 
Grant me this last, this crowning joy of life — 
To laugh at Death ! " 

Mr. John Hale Ingham writes verse that is ob- 
vious and respectable. He can take any kind of a 
theme, and construct upon it a poem in any form, 
and the product becomes tolerable, except to the 
sense that finds all mediocrity intolerable. Mr. 
Ingham is inspired to sing by art, religion, foreign 
travel, and the memory of the great. Music also 
inspires him, and modern science. He is capable of 
writing sonnets on the trolley, the ROntgen ray, and 
liquid air. This is his poetic description of " The 
Trolley ": 

" Not with such steeds as on the Olympic day 
To scorned defeat or sacred victory led, 
Nor by the powers of vapor piloted 
Whose shrieks fill night with discord and dismay, 
We journey here. This monster doth essay 
To clasp with claw of iron overhead 
The chained, invisible lightning and be sped 
By heavenly currents on its earthly way." 

Mr. Ingham's collection is entitled " Pompeii of 
the West and Other Poems." The title piece is a 
comparison of the buried city of Magna Gra?cia with 
the White City of Chicago, built for 1893, and now 
razed to the earth, while 

" Over lake and plain 
The wild birds circle till the night sweeps on," 

a not altogether accurate account of present-day 
conditions. 

It is not every poet who can get a queen to stand 
sponsor for his musings, but Mr. Arthur Upson has 
been thus fortunate with his " Westwind Song?," 
and no less a personage than "Carmen Sylva" has 
introduced them. The introduction is in a fine vein 
of rhapsody. " The Westwind said : Come, sing 



with me, for thou ha6t wept ! Come, sing with me, 
and touch my harp ; for here I bring a Brother- 
soul to thee, with all the Song in it as Chidder's 
song returning when Centuries revolved and Centu- 
ries came back to sing the same unwavering Song 
in India as in Hiawatha's Home — the Song of hu- 
man Tears." We are not acquainted with Chidder, 
but doubt if he could have sung of " Wheat Eleva- 
tors " in such strains as these : 

" Castles, or Titans' houses, or huge fanes 

Of ancient gods that yet compel men's fear — 
What powers, what pomps do these betoken here 
Looming aloft upon the plough-seamed plains?" 

Perhaps this selection is not quite fair to Mr. Upson, 
and we hasten to supplement it by another, this time 
chosen without satirical intent. 

" In Holyrood, up yellow stair 
I sought the turret chamber where 

On summer evenings long ago 

The mandolin of Rizzio 
Made Mary music, rich and rare. 

" And, pausing in the shadows there, 

Methought some echo of his air 
Along the hall came ringing low 
In Holyrood. 

" Ah, 'twas a sighing wind that bare 
The burthen of old heart-despair, 
And trembled at the casement so, 
Like dying hope or love in woe, 
Remembering days when life was fair 
In Holyrood ! " 

This is pretty, but we confess that the " bare " 
puzzles us. 

Mr. Ernest Crosby puts much indignation, and 
fervor, and moral earnestness into his " Swords and 
Plowshares," preaching the Tolstoyan gospel with 
fanatical conviction. Most of the work in this vol- 
ume is in the sort of irregular prose which we asso- 
ciate with Whitman, although without Whitman's 
verbal felicity and inspired phrasing. With these 
pieces we have no concern, for they are not poetry 
in any sense. When Mr. Crosby essays the regular 
forms, he can write such a simple and direct appeal 
to the conscience as the following verses on " Life 
and Death ": 

" So he died for his faith. That is fine — 
More than most of us do. 
But stay, can you add to that line 
That he lived for it, too ? 

" In his death he bore witness at last 
As a martyr to truth. 
Did his life do the same in the past 
From the days of his youth ? 

" It is easy to die. Men have died 
For a wish or a whim — 
From bravado or passion or pride. 
Was it harder for him? 

" But to live : every day to live out 
All the truth that he dreamt, 
While his friends met his conduct with doubt, 
And the world with contempt, — 

" Was it thus that he plodded ahead, 
Never turning aside ? 
Then we'll talk of the life that he led, — 
Never mind how he died."

THE DIAL

Several of Mr. Crosby's poems are inspired by 
passionate indignation at the Philippine piracy 
which has disgraced our nation daring these late 
years. These pieces are not exactly poetry, but 
they have a bludgeon-like quality that makes them 
effective. 

The " Unfrequented Paths " of Mr. George E. 
McNeill are verses filled, like those of Mr. Crosby, 
with a burning sense of the sufferings of humanity, 
and voice the plea of the common people against 
their oppressors. 

" Lift off the poor man's burden, 
My country, grand and great ; 
The Orient has no treasures 
To buy a Christian State. 
Our souls brook not oppression, 
Our needs — if read aright — 
Call not for wide possession. 
But Freedom's sacred light." 

This verse is mostly of the pedestrian sort, but it 
has the accent of sincerity, and its amiable philan- 
thropy will endear it to uncritical readers. It 
comes nearest to taking flight from earth when it 
celebrates the memory or the fame of such men 
as Lincoln, Webster, and Tolstoy.

Early steamboat While collecting material for his 
navigation on the '• History of the Fur Trade," pub- 
Musouri river. j^ed a few years ago, Captain 
Chittenden made the acquaintance of the late Joseph 
La Barge, one of the pioneer steamboat men on the 
Missouri River, and wrote out from dictation his 
reminiscences, both for their bearing upon the his- 
tory of the fur trade and with a view of preparing 
a memoir of Captain La Barge. As the reminis- 
cences covered the whole period of steamboat ac- 
tivity upon the Missouri, the projected memoir has 
very naturally expanded into the " History of Early 
Steamboat Navigation upon the Missouri River " 
now published by Mr. F. P. Harper. Beginning 
on the Missouri in 1832. the steamboat business 
was almost exclusively confined to the fur trade 
until 1846. After that, the Mormon migration, the 
Mexican war. the gold fever, Indian missions, and 
railroad surveys increased the traffic, until in 1859 
more boats left St. Louis for the Missouri than for 
both the Upper and Lower Mississippi. During the 
Civil War the trade suffered somewhat, but the Mon- 
tana gold discoveries raised it to its highest point 
during the years immediately following. The rail- 
road reached the Missouri at St. Joseph in 1859, but 
it was not until 1867, the year of greatest prosperity 
in the river trade, that the extension of the North- 
western Railroad to Council Bluffs made the com- 
petition serious. The struggle between road and 
river lasted twenty years. The final blow fell in 
1887, when the Great Northern reached Helena, 
Montana. After that time, the river trade prac- 



tically ceased. Captain Chittenden says that the 
river, contrary to the usual opinion, is as navigable 
as ever, and that the trade failed solely because the 
need for it had passed. In the very year of its fail- 
ure, Congress created the Missouri River Commis- 
sion, which carried on extensive river improvements 
until its termination last year. When the trade 
stopped the improvement began. Captain Chitten- 
den thinks that, notwithstanding their failure to 
effect the object intended, the improvements have 
been worth much more than their cost in the saving 
of property, and that upon this ground they should 
be continued. In his opinion, a future use for the 
waters of the river will be found in the irrigation 
of the arid lands along its upper course. During 
the early period, the history of the navigation of 
the Missouri amounts almost to a history of the 
whole Missouri country, since the river furnished 
the only means of communication and everything 
done in the country depended upon it. • Viewed in 
this light, an apparently local topic covers a dis- 
tinct phase in the development of the West, and 
thus becomes an important part of the history of 
the whole country. Captain Chittenden tells the 
story well. Large type and wide margins extend 
the work to two volumes ; but it is really a short 
narrative, which may be read with interest in a 
few hours. 

Qame/uhet, Two recent volumes of " The Sports- 

bxg and little, man's Library" (Macmillan) are 

devoted to the interests of the ang- 
ler. In " Bass, Pike, Perch, and Others " Dr. James 
A. Henshall treats of all of the game-fishes east 
of the Rocky Mountains except the salmons and 
trouts, and the tarpons, jewfisb, and other fishes of 
large size which are described in other volumes of 
the series. Dr. Henshall writes from the full expe- 
rience of many years of successful angling in waters 
fresh and salt, and from the point of view of the 
trained naturalist as well as that of the skilful 
sportsman. The angler will find minute directions 
concerning the appropriate tackle and other para- 
phernalia of the sportsman, as well as valuable sug- 
gestions concerning methods of angling for each 
species, and a very intelligent discussion of the 
habits of the fish. In this latter feature the book 
is of considerable value as a work in natural history. 
It includes a brief technical diagnosis of each spe- 
cies, and is abundantly illustrated, so that the fish- 
erman may determine the affinities of his catch with 
scientific accuracy. — The second of the two volumes 
is also from the pen of a well-known sportsman- 
naturalist, Mr. Charles F. Holder, who writes of 
"The Big Game Fishes of the United States." Ang- 
ling for the great oceanic game-fishes — the tarpon, 
the tuna, and the black sea-bass — is essentially a 
modern pastime, and its pursuit has led to the estab- 
lishment of the highest standards of sportsmanship 
in such organizations as the Tuna Club of Santa 
Catalina. These giants of the sea are pursued and 
taken — though not without a long and vigorous

struggle — with tackle so light that the layman 
who first sees it doubts the evidence of his eyes. 
The author does not give technical descriptions of 
the fishes he treats, but his word-pictures are so 
vivid that even the novice should be able to recog- 
nize his captures. There are also some very good 
plates in color, by Mr. Charles F. A. Mielatz, of 
these large fishes in action, and other illustrations 
which add to the value of the book. This volume 
will be of much interest to those who do not pursue 
the big game of the deep. It is written by a most 
experienced angler, and from his rich store he en- 
livens his account with many an entertaining tale, 
all doubtless true, though nothing is lost in the tell- 
ing. The book affords excellent fishing by proxy 
for those who prefer or who must take their sport 
in this way. The high standard of scientific and 
literary excellence established in some of the earlier 
numbers of the series is well maintained in these 
latest volumes. 

The widespread study of living birds 
relation to m the field has so awakened interest 
mankind. in all their activities that a manual 
of economic ornithology is most opportune. Pro- 
fessor C. M. Weed and Mr. Dearborn, in their 
" Birds in Relation to Man" (Lippincott), have 
compiled from the numerous and widely scattered 
Government and State reports, and from scientific 
journals and their own note-books, a very full ac- 
count of the feeding habits of our more important 
native birds, and of the relation which such habits 
bear to harmful and beneficial insects, to the fruit 
and grain industry, and to the foes and friends of 
the farmer in orchard, field, and meadow. The 
book abounds in statistical details of potato beetles 
slain by the thousand and caterpillars by the tens 
of thousands ; while the broader phases of the sub- 
ject are not overlooked. We find an account of 
the procedure employed in the study of the food of 
birds, and note with pleasure the substitution of 
more humane methods for that of the deadly shot- 
gun. There is an account of the history of economic 
ornithology, a discussion of the proportions of ani- 
mal and vegetable elements in the food of birds, and 
some astonishing statistics as to the amount con- 
sumed. Methods for the conservation of the birds, 
devices for preventing their depredations, and means 
of encouraging their presence in garden and or- 
chard, are discussed, and a full bibliography, prin- 
cipally of American sources, is given. The book 
will be a welcome and valuable addition to many 
school libraries, and to the book-shelf of every na- 
ture lover. 

The first volume of Professor Julius 
Hann's Handbuch der Klimatologie, 
in its second German edition, has 
been translated by Professor R. De C. Ward, and is 
now issued as a complete " Handbook of Climat- 
ology" (Macmillan). It deals with all of the gen- 
eral phases of the subject, and seeks to present as 
graphic a picture as possible of the way in which all 



The science 
cf Climate. 



the atmospheric phenomena work together at any 
place on the earth's surface. Of necessity, separate 
treatment is given to the various climatic elements, 
or factors, — such as temperature, humidity, rain 
and snow, velocity and direction of the wind, influ- 
ence of the ocean and of mountains, and of latitude. 
The main types of climate, — solar, physical, con- 
tinental, marine, and mountain, — are defined, and 
their various differentiating factors are discussed 
with illustrations from meteorological measure- 
ments. The translator has made a number of changes 
in the work. A few unimportant details of purely 
European interest have been omitted, a consider- 
able number of illustrations from American sources 
have been inserted, and such additions have been 
made as are needed to bring the work up to date. 
The American reader will still find the book largely 
foreign in its sources and illustrations ; but this is in 
part due to the greater perfection and duration of 
European meteorological records, and in part to the 
fact that the original author was a German. This 
is not a popular work, but a thoroughly modern 
high-grade scientific treatise on a somewhat techni- 
cal though familiar subject, — the weather. 

a volume/or j n wr Jti n g of " Municipal Public 

and "students of Works, their Inception, Construction, 
municipal affairs, and Management," Mr. S. Whinery, 
a civil engineer of New York, shows a broad out- 
look upon the problems involved, as well as a famil- 
iarity with the details of municipal engineering and 
contracting. The result is a volume of practical 
value, not only to the inexperienced city officials for 
whom it is primarily intended, but to students of 
municipal affairs generally. Mr. Whinery expres- 
ses the unorthodox opinion that municipal contrac- 
tors are not necessarily corrupt, and even holds 
that public work may often be done by contract 
more economically and satisfactorily than by the 
direct employment of labor by the city. There are 
chapters on special assessments and uniform mu- 
nicipal accounting, a well-balanced discussion of 
municipal ownership, and a final chapter offering 
well-considered suggestions for the control of public- 
service corporations. The municipality and the 
quasi-public corporation are likened to the partners 
in an enterprise of common benefit, between whom 
there should be mutual cooperation rather than 
antagonism ; and principles are laid down by means 
of which the public might make sure of its share of 
the benefits resulting from future grants of fran- 
chises. (Macmillan.) 

Professor Laughlin of the Uni- 
T of e ReXrocUy. versity of Chicago, and Professor 

Willis of Washington and Lee Uni- 
versity, have prepared a timely and practical ex- 
position of the too little understood subject of 
Reciprocity, particularly as it concerns trade con- 
ditions in this country. The authors quote and 
endorse President Hadley's definition of reciprocity 
as "a relation between two independent powers,

such that the citizens of each are guaranteed cer- 
tain commercial privileges at the hands of the 
other." They treat of the origin and nature of the 
reciprocity idea, consider the subject historically, 
show that not until the last quarter-century had it 
obtained any great hold upon the public mind as a 
determinate policy, trace clearly and impartially 
Congressional legislation on the subject beginning 
with Canada and Hawaii and following the work- 
ings under the McKinley and Dingley Acts and 
the effects of the Wilson Bill repealing the reci- 
procity clause in the McKinley Act, show the inef- 
ficient and unsatisfactory results under the policy 
generally, and conclude that as the outcome of all 
the attempts " the futility of reciprocity efforts has 
apparently been shown with great conclusiveness." 
They believe that a revulsion of opinion has set 
in, and that tariff-reform sentiment is in the atmos- 
phere and not far distant ; that at most reciprocity 
has been but a poor piece of legislation calculated 
to placate the demand for substantial relief from 
high tariff duties. The subject seems to have been 
handled in a fair and intelligent way. The bibliog- 
raphy is very full and valuable, and the appendix 
contains various treaties and agreements with dif- 
ferent countries growing out of the reciprocity idea. 
(Baker & Taylor Co.) 

In "God and Music" (Baker & 
Taylor Co.), Dr. John Harrington 
Edwards has undertaken a study of 
theology in its relations to music, and of music in 
the possibilities of its adoption to religious life and 
work. He points out that the more thoroughly 
music is studied, in its rhythmical constitution and 
its correlations with other forms of spiritual and 
physical being, the more certainly it is seen to 
be cosmical in itself, and in its interrelations with 
the rest of the universe. " Music," says the au- 
thor, " is the lingua franca of the universe, the 
only known language indigenous to heaven and 
heard in all inhabited worlds. . . . Music, as in- 
volved in Nature, is objective, elementary, me- 
chanical. Innate in man, and evolved by human 
intelligence and effort, it is subjective, intellectual, 
purposed. That its scientific marvels and aesthetic 
beauty are the chance products of purposeless evo- 
lution, let him believe who can." Dr. Edwards 
inquires into the power of music, discusses musico- 
therapy, the law and correlations of music, etc., 
and treats the subject from its scientific and aes- 
thetic points of view, as well as in its theological 
aspects. We are told that no special originality is 
claimed for the present work, except, perhaps, in 
the marshalling of known facts, and the converging 
upon the main point of more or less familiar lines 
of argument in an unfamiliar but legitimate way. 

Mr. Alfred Hodder's volume entitled 
"A Fight for the City" (Macmillan)

paign in New York City in the fall of 1901, cen- 
tring around the interesting personality of Mr.

hUtory. 



William Travers Jerome, the successful candidate 
for the office of District Attorney on the Fusion 
ticket, and preceded by an account of the series of 
raids of gambling-houses which brought Mr. Jerome 
into prominence as a reformer. It is interesting 
to note that these raids were not begun on Mr. 
Jerome's initiative, but that his determination that 
they should not be farces, backed by the authority 
of his judicial position exercised in impromptu 
court-rooms, was what made all the difference be- 
tween these raids and the ineffectual ones that had 
been made from time to time before. Mr. Jerome's 
fearless honesty and bluntness of speech are well 
illustrated by extracts from his public utterances 
during the campaign, which more than once were 
thought to have alienated more votes than they 
could win, but which proved to be as successful with 
the people as they were satisfactory to the con- 
science of the speaker. The narrative combines 
the fascination of fiction with the value of an inter- 
esting and important section of recent history, and 
may be read with profit by the friends of reform 
everywhere. Mr. Hodder shares to the full Mr. 
Jerome's dislike for "the administrative lie" and 
u the decorative phrase," and is, in short, something 
of a hero-worshipper. 

It is mainly to the half-dozen charm- 
ZJiZl."" in g translations by Mr. Andrew 

Lang that English readers owe their 
knowledge of Pierre de Ronsard. foremost poet of 
the Renaissance in France and known throughout 
the Europe of his own day as " Prince of Poets." 
But these and some other fugitive renderings from 
various hands have only served to whet our ap- 
petites for the feast which is now spread in the 
volume of " Songs and Sonnets of Ronsard," as 
selected, translated, and edited by Mr. Curtis 
Hidden Page, and issued from the " limited edition 
department" of Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 
Mr. Page's work seems to us in all ways excellent. 
His translation is graceful and fluent to a marked 
degree, and almost uniformly successful in follow- 
ing the difficult verse-forms and rhythms of the 
French poet. His Introduction is a finished bit of 
critical writing, and the Notes are neither cumber- 
some nor superfluous. To the mechanical form of 
the volume praise may be accorded in equal mea- 
sure. It is in many respects the most pleasing piece 
of book-making yet accomplished by Mr. Rogers in 
his work at the Riverside Press. Typography, 
paper, and binding are so skilfully chosen as to 
produce an antique atmosphere at once delightful 
in itself and in perfect harmony with the delicate 
old-world flavor of Ronsard's verse. For the col- 
lector of fine books, no less than the lover of beau- 
tiful poetry, this little pocket volume will prove a 
treasure.

BRIEFER MENTION. 

Mr. Sherwin Cody's " Selections from the Best Eng- 
lish Essays" (McClurg) is intended to illustrate the 
development of English prose style by a series of typi- 
cal examples. The authors represented are Bacon, 
Swift, Addison, Lamb, DeQuincey, Carlyle, Emerson, 
Macaulay, Ruskin, and Arnold — an unimpeachable se- 
lection. But Mr. Cody's book is more than a mere 
reprint, for it includes an introductory chapter of some 
thirty pages on " The English Essay and English Prose 
Style," while with each writer represented goes a brief 
special introduction. The selections given are typical 
of their authors, and all belong to English literature in 
the best sense. Mr. Cody, in preparing this volume, 
has done a real service to the busy reader who does not 
hope to be a scholar but who is glad to learn something 
of the development of the chief literary forms. 

Three volumes of the " Centenary " edition of Em- 
erson have now been published by Messrs. Houghton, 
Mifflin & Co. "Nature: Addresses and Lectures" is 
the title of the first, which gives us a handsome portrait 
in photogravure, a preface and biographical sketch by 
Dr. Edward Waldo Emerson, and an extensive collec- 
tion of notes, which are of the greatest value. The 
" Essays," first and second series, are given in the two 
other volumes, which also are supplied with the notes 
which form the distinctive feature of this new edition. 
The total number of volumes cannot yet be announced, 
for the pleasant reason that much hitherto unpublished 
material is to be added to Emerson's works, and the 
amount of this is not yet definitely determined. Typo- 
graphically the volumes are all that the most exacting 
taste could wish. 

We have previously spoken of Mr. Roscoe Lewis 
Ashley's "The Federal State" as probably the best 
manual of the subject thus far prepared for secondary 
instruction. The book is somewhat bulky for such use, 
which to some minds constitutes a serious objection, and 
it is with such critics in mind that the author has now 
produced a briefer work on the same subject, entitled 
" American Government," and published, like its pre- 
decessor, by the Macmillan Co. The work has illus- 
trations, which is something of a new departure for 
text-books of civil government. We can recommend it 
in much the same terms that were applied to the earlier 
and larger volume. 



Notes.

culture for Beginners," the joint work of Professors 
Charles William Burkett, Frank Lincoln Stevens, and 
Daniel Harvey Hill, all of the North Carolina College

Civitate Dei," in an edition prepared by Dr. F. N. 
Bussell, somewhat rearranged as to text, and provided 
with notes, is published by the Macmillan Co. as a

"Stories from the Hebrew," by Miss Josephine 
Woodbury Heermaus, is a reading-book for schools 
which draws for material alternately upon the books of 
the Old Testament and the works of the modern poets. 
Messrs Silver, Burdett & Co. are the publishers. 

Mr. Ernest L. Briggs, of the former firm of Briggs 
Brothers, Plymouth, Mass., will hereafter conduct a 
general publishing business in Boston under the style 
of "The Fortune Press." His first book will be "A 
Rose o' Plymouth-Town," written by Miss Beulah 
Marie Dix and Miss Evelyn Greenleaf Sutherland. 

A " Biographical " edition of Charles Dickens's works 
is announced for immediate publication by the J. B. 
Lippincott Co. Each of the twenty volumes will con- 
tain a biographical introduction, and the series of 
original drawings by Cruikshank, " Phiz," and others. 
Forster's Life is also to be included in the edition. 

Volume XL of "The New International Encyclo- 
paedia" (Larrey — Maximianus II.), has just been sent 
us by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. Among the note- 
worthy articles are Latin Literature, Libraries, Light, 
Lincoln, London, Lucien, Magnetism, and Man. The 
illustrations are, as usual, numerous and interesting. 

It is announced that Professor W. E. Burghardt 
Du Bois is at work on a novel which Messrs. A. C. Mc- 
Clurg & Co., the publishers of his successful book, 
" The Souls of Black Folk," will bring out in the Fall 
of 1904. Needless to say, Professor Du Bois's story 
will deal with the subject that lies nearest his heart — 
the Negro problem. 

Two more volumes of the reissue of Arber's 
" English Garner " have been sent us by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. Mr. C. H. Firth edits the volume of 
"Stuart Tracts," which contains practically no new 
material, in distinction from the volume of " Fifteenth 
Century Prose and Verse," edited by Mr. Alfred W. 
Pollard, nearly half of the contents of this collection 
being now for the first time included. The new matter 
includes " Everyman," from John Skot's edition, circa 
1525, which will be welcome to many readers.

Ten years ago we reviewed M. Desire' H. Girouard's 
valuable historical monograph on " Lake St. Louis." 
A supplementary volume, containing much new matter 
brought to light during recent years, is now published 
by Messrs Poirier, Bessette, & Co., Montreal. The 
work has, we understand, also been published in a 
French edition of which the thick pamphlet now be- 
fore us, which continues the paging of the earlier vol- 
ume, is an English translation. 

For the octavo series of the decennial publications of 
the University of Chicago, Miss Myra Reynolds has 
edited " The Poems of Anne Countess of Winchester." 
Besides the volume of 1713, the editor has had access to 
two important manuscripts, which contain many pieces 
hitherto imprinted. A long critical and biographical 
introduction, compiled from original sources, is contrib- 
uted by the editor, and is a valuable feature of the 
edition. The volume is a stout one, containing upwards 
of four hundred pages. 

Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.'s list of publications 
for the coming Autumn promises to be rich in interest 
and variety. In the field of fiction there will be new 
books by Kate Douglas Wiggin, Clara Louise Burnham, 
the Baroness von Hutten, Guy Wetmore Carryl, Will 
Payne, Ruth Hall, Mary Hallock Foote, Ellen Olney 
Kirk, and Mrs. M. E. M. Davis, to mention only well- 
known authors. There will be volumes of essays by 
Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Samuel M. Crothers, Henry D. 
Sedgwick, Jr., and Charles A. Dinsmore ; and new nature 
books by John Burroughs and Bradford Torrey. A 
biography of Henry Ward Beecher, by Lyman Abbott, 
is promised, as well as Prof. Simon Newcomb's " Rem- 
iniscences of an Astronomer," two volumes on " Ameri- 
can Tariff Controversies in the 19th Century," by 
Edward Stanwood, and " Ultimate Conceptions of 
Faith," by Dr. George A. Gordon. There will be six or 
seven new volumes of poetry. 

Charles Carroll Bonney died at his home in Chicago 
on the twenty-third of August, having nearly com- 
pleted his seventy-second year. He was born and 
educated in Hamilton, New York, where he taught 
school for a time. He came to Illinois in 1850, con- 
tinued teaching for two years, and was then admitted 
to the bar. He practised law in Chicago for over thirty 
years, and became eminent in his profession. His chief 
title to fame is based npon his organization and direc- 
tion of the entire series of Congresses held in Chicago 
in 1893, at the time of the World's Fair. To him, far 
more than to any other man, was due not only the in- 
ception but the carrying into effect of this extraor- 
dinarily successful enterprise. The extensive body of 
literature resulting from the Congresses was collected 
by him and is now deposited in the Chicago Public 
Library, where it will remain as a visible memorial of 
what he accomplished. He was a writer of law-books, 
and of many miscellaneous papers on matters of relig- 
ion, political philosophy, and social reform. He was 
also a valued contributor to these pages. A good man 
in the best sense, and a man of remarkable intellectual 
force, his death is a cause for sincere mourning on the 
part of all who enjoyed his acquaintance.

SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT 

To be published in October 

Father Louis Hennepin's 

"A New Discovery" 

Exact Reprint of Second Issue of i6q8 
WITH INTRODUCTION, NOTES, AND AN ANALYTICAL INDEX 

By Reuben Gold Thwaites 

In Two Volumes, with facsimiles of original title-pages, maps, and other illustrations 



TT is believed that A New Discovery — especially the second issue of 1698, which has 
* been chosen for reproduction — is the most representative of Hennepin's works. It is 
a thoroughly readable volume, abounding in quaintly-phrased humor, satire, invective, and 
graphic description ; adventures are related in almost every chapter ; and through it all the 
man himself, a sorry braggart, yet never lacking courage, and possessing powers of keen 
observation, stands out in bold relief. As a human document, it has few rivals in our litera- 
ture. Moreover, it is the only one of the Hennepin books now upon the market ; Shea's 
Louisiane has for twenty years been out of print, and all of the original editions are rare and 
costly luxuries. 

The work of editing this careful reprint has been undertaken by Reuben Gold 
Thwaites, who, in addition to supervising the publication in every detail, furnishes a bio- 
graphical and critical Introduction of some 9000 words, copious Notes, and an analytical 
Index. Mr. Thwaites's eminence as an authority on all matters connected with the his- 
tory of the West, and his well known standing as an editor, will be sufficient assurance of 
the manner in which the enterprise will be carried out. Victor Hugo Paltsits, of Lenox 
Library, New York — one of the most expert of American bibliographers — contributes a 
new Bibliography of Hennepin. 

There seems no doubt, then, that this beautiful, well-appointed, and well-edited edition 
of A New Discovery will at once be accepted as an interesting and very valuable addition to 
American historical sources,and will meet with the large sale which its merits so richly deserve. 

The reprint will be issued in two square octavo volumes of nearly 500 pages each. 
The type used will be a large, clear face of pica old style, admirably adapted to the character 
of the work. Fac-similes of the title-pages of the original edition will be given, together 
with fac-similes of the seven full page illustrations and the two large folding maps. There 
will be two editions : one in regular library style, on an extra quality of soft laid paper, gilt 
top, with uncut edges; and a special large-paper edition, limited to 150 numbered copies on 
the finest quality of Brown's hand-made paper. 



Regular library edition, two volumes, in box, price $6.00 net.

READY OCTOBER 3 



By F. HOPKINSON SMITH 
A wholly new story, entitled 



Colonel Carter's Christmas 

ANY who are not acquainted with the celebrated Colonel Carter of Cartersville will make his acquaintance 
under the most fortunate circumstances in this story, which is an entirely new one, not heretofore pub- 
lished, even serially ; while those who know him of old, and of course love him, will find here, in 
addition to the renewal of an old and delightful friendship, quite a new revelation of a character that has 
made a deep and lasting impression. All the old characters are met again : Chad, the Colonel's servant, 
Aunt Nancv, Fitz, Klutchem, and the Major, together with two new ones. In the old story the Colonel 
triumphed financially ; in this one the issue hangs upon sheer courtesy and nobility of heart.

The Daughter of a Magnate 



Illustrated 



By FRANK H. SPEARMAN 

Author of "Doctor Bryson" 



12mo, $1.50 



'T'HE romance of that greatest of American "interests," the railway, has never been depicted 
1 with the expertness, sympathy and systematic elaborateness that distinguish Mr. Spearman's 
new book — the successor of his powerful and vivid "Doctor Bryson." The atmosphere of 
"railroading," and that on the largest and most impressive scale, permeates the story, which 
is not only extremely graphic, and illustrative of the perils and difficulties as well as the feats 
and accomplishments of railroad life, but also a love story of peculiar force and great beauty. 
The hero and heroine are typically American and attracted to each other by a natural attach- 
ment that is called upon to overcome the greatest of obstacles.

A WORK OF GREAT IMPORTANCE 

Reminiscences of the Civil War 

By General JOHN B. GORDON 
With three portraits, large 8vo. $3.00 net (postage additional) 

THESE reminiscences, which are destined to take the place on the Southern side held by 
General Grant's "Memoirs" on the Northern side, were written by General Gordon 
from time to time throughout a great number of years. They are not, therefore, a made-to- 
order book, but the spontaneous recollections of a very full life. From Bull Run to Appo- 
mattox General Gordon was in most of the great fights of General Lee's army. He knew the 
leaders of the Confederacy intimately, and his acquaintance was enlarged during his career as 
a United States Senator by intimate association with leaders of the Union cause. He was the 
friend of General Grant to the end of his life. This is not a narrative history of the war, but 
records, with anecdote, incident, and with eloquence, the personal experiences of General Gordon 
and the eminent leaders who were his friends. No other such intimately personal record has 
been produced by either side. Every chapter contains humorous incidents, and even pathetic 
ones, which will pass into the permanent history of the war. 



Vacation Days in Greece 

By Rufus B. Richardson 
Of the American Archaeological School at Athens 
Fully illustrated 
8<vo, $2.00 net {postage 20 cents) 
DROFESSOR Rufus B. Richardson, during a resi- 
dence of eleven years inGreece as head of the Amer- 
ican Archaeological School in Athens, has had an unex- 
celled opportunity to visit many parts of Greece less 
frequently visited by the tourist, but most picturesque 
and interesting. He describes his excursions into these 
regions in a series of sketches of great informal charm, 
told from the picturesque rather than from the archaeo- 
logical and scholarly point of view, although the two 
are so judiciously combined that the book will be indis- 
pensable both to the student and to the general traveller 
in Greece.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF GREAT INTEREST 

Autobiography of Seventy Years 

By Senator GEORGE F. HOAR 
Two volumes, large 8vo, with portrait. $7.50 net (postage additional) 

M OT only for its political importance, but for the unusual personal, social and literary interest of the remi- 
niscences it brings together, Senator Hoar's autobiography will be the most notable contribution of the 
year to memoir-literature. It would be impossible to find another man in the country who has known more 
of the important men and measures of his time than Mr. Hoar; and the charm and piquancy of his style, with 
its range, from the eloquent discussion of his political principles to the humor of his anecdotes, are as remark- 
able as his experiences. The book is refreshingly frank and full of character and individuality — a record of 
opinions as well as events.

FALL BOOKS-1903 



THE CASTLE OF TWILIGHT 

By Margaret Horton Potter. With six full-page illustrations in color by 

Charlotte Weber. $1.50. 
For some time Miss Potter has had in mind a book which would give, in some measure, an idea of 
the conditions under which women lived in the days of feudalism. It is difficult for a modern 
mind to realize the loneliness and monotony that were bravely faced by the chatelaines of isolated 
castles when their husbands and sons departed to battle or to the court. Just what this meant to 
them is brought out with notable art by Miss Potter in her new romance. Her story of the life 
of three brave and beautiful women at the Breton castle will reach the sympathy of the reader in 
a way that can be equalled by few recent novels. The pictures in color by Charlotte Weber are 
equally notable for their sympathy with the text and their rare artistic quality. A consistent decor- 
ative treatment has been utilized in the type and binding, and altogether the book is one of remark- 
able distinction and most exceptional interest. (Ready September 26.) 

THE SCARLET BANNER 

By Felix Dahn. Translated from the German by Mary J. Safford. I2mo y $i.jo. 
This story, published in Germany under the title of " Gelimer," is the third volume in the group 
of romances to which " Felicitas " and "A Captive of the Roman Eagles" belong, and, like them, 
deals with the long-continued conflict between the Germans and the Romans. But in the present 
novel the scene of the struggle is transferred from the forests of Germania to the arid sands of 
Africa, and, in wonderfully vivid pen-pictures, the author displays the marvellous magnificence 
surrounding the descendants of the Vandal Genseric, the superb pageants of their festivals, and the 
luxury, whose enervating influence has gradually sapped the strength and courage of the rude, 
invincible warriors — once the terror of all the neighboring coasts and islands — till their enfeebled 
limbs can no longer support the weight of their ancestors' armor, and they cast aside their helmets 
to crown themselves with the rose-garlands of Roman revellers. Miss Safford, to whom the 
translation has been intrusted, is well known for her English versions of George Ebers's novels. 
(Ready October 14..) 

RAIDING WITH MORGAN 

By Byron A. Dunn. With ten full-page illustrations. $1.25. 
This is a new volume in Mr. Dunn's famous "Young Kentuckians Series," and has the same 
excitement and dash that have made the others popular. Unlike them, this story is told from the 
Southern standpoint. (Ready September JO.) 

MARRIAGE IN EPIGRAM 

Compiled by Frederick W. Morton. i8mo, net 80 cents ; delivered, 85 cents. 
This is the fourth and last volume of the famous "Epigram Series." Mr. Morton has shown, by 
the use of aphorisms and sayings collected from the wits of all ages, that marriage is what he calls 
"the world's greatest paradox — the survival of paradise or a foretaste of purgatory." Whatever 
one's ideas may be on the subject, he is sure to find many a sympathetic touch in this delightful 
little collection. (Ready September 2J.)

A NOTABLE CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICANA. 

HENNEPIN'S "A NEW DISCOVERY" 

Edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites. An Exact Reprint of the Edition of i6g8. 
With introduction, notes, and an analytical index by Mr. Thwaites. In two vol- 
umes, with facsimiles of original title-pages, maps, and illustrations. Library edition, 
square 8vo, in box, net $6.00 ; delivered, $6.35. Large-paper edition (limited), on 
Brown's hand-made paper, 7% x 10 inches, in box, net $18.00. 
Every collection of Americana should contain at least one of Father Hennepin's famous books. It 
is believed that " A New Discovery" — especially the second issue of 1698, which has been chosen 
for reproduction — is the most representative and readable product of his pen. Moreover, it is the 
only one of the Hennepin books now upon the market. There seems to be no doubt that this 
beautiful, well appointed, and well-edited edition of "Nouvelle Decouverte" will at once be accepted 
as an interesting and valuable addition to American historical sources. (Ready October 3.) 
Note: This reprint is uniform with McClurg's edition of "Lewis and Clark." 

HOW GEORGE ROGERS CLARK WON THE 

NORTHWEST And Other Essays in Western History 

By Reuben Gold Thwaites. Illustrated. i2mo, net $1.20 ; delivered, $1.31. 
His extended researches and his natural sympathy with the subject, have brought Mr. Thwaites to 
a first place among historians of the West. The several authoritative volumes that he has already 
published are recognized as standard, but in this book he has relaxed somewhat into a more popular 
vein. The majority of the eight papers contained in the volume were first delivered as lectures and 
were later accorded magazine publication. For the present publication they have been radically 
revised and brought down to date, and comprise an exceptionally interesting collection of papers 
covering a wide range of topics under the one general head. (Ready October 3.) 

ON THE STORIED OHIO 

By Reuben Gold Thwaites. New edition, with twelve full-page illustrations. 

i2mo, net $1.20; delivered, $1.31. 
This trip was undertaken by Mr. Thwaites some years ago, with the idea of gathering local color 
for his studies of Western history. The Ohio River was an important factor in the development 
of the West. He therefore wished to know intimately the great waterway in its various phases, and 
there seemed no better way than to make the pilgrimage as nearly as possible in the manner of the 
pioneer canoeist or flat-boatman himself. The voyage is described with much charm and humor, 
and with a constant realization of the historic traditions on every side. (Ready October 3.) 

Note : The last two books are uniform with Mr. Thwaites's " Down Historic Waterways." 

A SHORT HISTORY OF MEXICO 

By Arthur Howard Noll. New revised edition, with new matter. i6mo, 

net 75 cents ; delivered, 84 cents. 
The first edition of Dr. Noll's admirable little book was prompted by the lack of any compre- 
hensive history of Mexico in the English language. General histories pass over the three centuries 
of Spanish rule, the long struggle for independence, the establishment of the short-lived empire, 
followed by a nominal republic and the rise and fall of the second empire, as subjects of but little 
interest, and without giving accurate information regarding them. Dr. Noll's book was the first to 
thoroughly supply this need, and after ten years it is still alone in the field. This new edition has 
been thoroughly revised and brought down to date. (Ready October 10.)

TALKS OF NAPOLEON AT ST. HELENA With General 
Baron Gourgaud. 

Translated from the French by Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer. With eight 

portraits. 8vo, net $1.50; delivered, $1.64. 
These intimate conversations of Napoleon with his faithful friend have long been standard in 
French, but this is the first English translation ever published. As the talks deal with the mon- 
archs, generals, and politicians of his time, the work is of extraordinary historical value. Lord 
Roseberv, in "-Napoleon — The Last Phase," says of Gourgaud's Journal : "In some respects not 
merely the most remarkable book relating to Napoleon at St. Helena, but to Napoleon at any time. 
. . . We feel a conviction that this book is more nearly the unvarnished truth than anything else 
that has been put forth." In a later chapter he calls it " the one capital and supreme record of life 
at St. Helena." (Ready September 30.) 

FAMOUS ASSASSINATIONS OF HISTORY 

By Francis Johnson. With 31 portraits. 8vo, net $1.50; delivered, $1.64. 
The thirty assassinations so famous in history, which are narrated in this volume, have never before 
had their stories told in a collected form in any language. They embrace a period of nearly twenty- 
five centuries, from Philip of Macedon to the late episode in Servia. Only those assassinations have 
been included which either had an important and political bearing on the world, or on the nation 
immediately affected, or which left a profound and, it would seem, indelible impression on the im- 
agination of contemporaries and posterity. It has been the object of the writer to make each of 
these " famous assassinations " the central scene of a picture, in which the political, religious, or 
national features of the epoch are portrayed. (Ready September ip.) 

A HANDBOOK OF MODERN JAPAN 

By Ernest W. Clement. Illustrated. 8vo, net $1.40 ; delivered, $1.53. 
Mr. Clement writes of modern Japan — the Japan which has within a few years become a world 
power. There is nothing in history more remarkable than the rapid development of civilization in 
this wonderful country, and this handbook gives exactly the information that is wanted by travellers 
or students. Mr. Clement has devoted his life to a close study of Japanese life and affairs, and knows 
his subject from every point of view. Out of his wide knowledge he has written this book — a 
practical reference work in every sense. There are over sixty illustrations from photographs, in- 
cluding portraits of statesmen, views of public buildings, and of various aspects of Japanese life. 
The usefulness of the work is increased by an elaborate and comprehensive map made especially for 
the volume, from the latest data obtainable. (Ready October 10.) 

FROM EMPIRE TO REPUBLIC 

By Arthur Howard Noll. With map and frontispiece. 8vo, net $1.40; 

delivered, $1.54. 
The scope of Dr. Noll's earlier volume naturally precluded a very detailed discussion of any one 
period in Mexican history. No succession of events, however, has had a more important effect on 
the development of the country than those concerned with the struggle for Constitutional Govern- 
ment, and the story of the change from Empire to Republic is quite worthy of a volume by itself. 
Dr. Noll has drawn upon his years of study of the subject to give a detailed and accurate account 
of this vital phase. (Ready October 10.)

Edited by Sherwin Cody. With a Biographical and Critical Study of English 
Prose Style. With photogravure frontispiece from a new photograph of the 
Zolnay Bust. i8mo, net $i.oo ; delivered, $1.08. 
The publishers believe that these volumes, especially the second one, offer the most original and 
striking study of Poe's art and personality ever printed. Even old students of Poe will be surprised 
to find in the new arrangement of Poe's criticism a detailed analysis of the general principles of 
novel writing and short-story writing, as well as the better known essays on poetry and examples of 
criticism of poetry, with his many pithy remarks on life and literature gathered from his journalistic 
book reviews. Mr. Cody has introduced a new method of editing in his "World's Greatest Short 
Stories" and "Best English Essays" — a method in which the editor contributes, in condensed 
form, as much critical originality as is usually expected from the author of a volume of original 
essays. The success of the earlier volumes gives assurance that his presentation of Poe will meet 
with general approbation. (Ready October y.) 

BIRDS OF CALIFORNIA An Introduction to the Three Hundred 
Most Common Birds of the State and Adjacent Islands. 

By Irene Grosvenor Wheelock. With 8 full-page plates and about 75 illus- 
trations in the text by Bruce Horsfall. 8vo, net $2.00 ; postage extra. Student's 
edition, flexible binding, net $1.50 ; postage extra. 
In this excellent volume Mrs. Wheelock, whose "Nestlings of Forest and Marsh " will be remem- 
bered, has prepared a complete survey of the Birds of California. She has covered thoroughly over 
three hundred species in a detailed and practical manner, rather than in a so-called popular style. 
At the same time it is not too technical to be quite as useful to the unscientific bird observer as to the 
scientific student. Separate space is devoted to each species, in which is given the author's personal 
observations of nesting habits, characteristics, and other details of equal interest and pertinency. 
Mr. Horsfall's pictures show a rare combination of absolute technical accuracy with the highest 
artistic merit. A special feature is the pocket edition with limp covers and narrow margins — a 
volume that the tourist, hunter, or trapper can conveniently carry with him. (Ready in November.)

Young people are especially attracted to the living things about them, and the spiders are always a 
peculiarly fascinating subject of their observation. They are a most interesting family of insects, and 
their ingenuity and patience are astonishing. One is amazed by their skill and craftsmanship. Miss 
Patterson has given the spiders very careful and painstaking study, and has written a distinct, simple, 
and attractive account, which makes an apparently complex and grewsome subject both entertaining 
and instructive. (Ready September 12. )

Perkins. Net $1.25 ; delivered, $1.45. 
" Prince Silverwings," Mrs. Harrison's first book, was one of the most popular and successful 
books for children published last Fall. This new collection of fairy tales is similar in character and 
appearance, except that the stories are, if anything, more delightful, and there are more pictures than 
in " Silverwings." The greatest charm of Mrs. Harrison's stories is found in the way they are told. 
They are meant to interest younger children, and are written with that idea in mind, in simple, direct 
language. Mrs. Perkins's pictures are very happv in conception. (Ready October IJ.)

Miss Martvn's first exhibition of drawings in Chicago, last Spiing, created an unusual stir in artistic 
circles, as the knowledge of her decided talent was confined almost entirely to her intimate friends. 
But her charming collection or sketches in red chalk and charcoal delighted the most exacting critics 
and entirely captured the public. The portraits of women were particularly commended for their 
charm and delicacy, as well as tor the undeniably dashing style in which they were handled. The 
interest in Miss Martvn's work has been so active that this portfolio containing ten of her delightful 
drawings of girls' heads will undoubtedly be eagerly welcomed. (Ready in November. J

No more appropriate subject for a gift book could be imagined than the stories of some of the most 
soul-stirring hymns of the Christian religion, those that have become endeared through long associa- 
tion. Especially is it true that the language of woman's soul has given the church its tenderest and 
most beautiful songs. Mr. Smith feels that from the hearts of women alone have come truly deli- 
cate thought, tenderness of tone, and deeply religious sentiment. (Ready September 2?.)

Few can equal Bishop Spalding in the creation of helpful every-day philosophy, and its best expres- 
sion is found in a book of this kind — made up of short paragraphs in the same style as his " Aphor-

NEW HARPER PUBLICATIONS 


MR. CHAMBERS'S romances are probably the most satisfying 
*** of their kind now appearing in America. His adventure car- 
ries one along with a sweep and a whirl that are irresistible ; his 
love scenes have a charm, a tenderness, and convincing reality that 
raise them far above the meetings of lovers in contemporary fiction. 
Paradise is an idyllic French village, and the maids thereof live in 
the stirring days of the Franco-Prussian War. Fighting is rife 
through many of these pages, but the dominant note is love, and 
and the romance is the happiest that the author has done. 
Illustrated by Andre Castaigne and others. $1.50. 


The Maids of Paradise 

By 

ROBERT W. CHAMBERS, author 

of " Cardigan," etc. 


A SPARKLING romance of old New York. Mr. Sudgeberry 
** tells the story, and unconsciously depicts himself a hopeless 
prig. He believes he is in love with Sylvia Gray — her beauty, 
her wit, her cherry ribbons dazzle his youthful but already ponder- 
ous and egotistical brain. Finally the pouting Sylvia decides to 
take a momentous step, and Mr. Sudgeberry intrudes at once, 
with officious attempts to save his Sylvia from a direful fate, but he 
learns that there is more than one string to the bow of a pretty 
girl. Sprightly, clever, and amusing comedy.

Letters Home 

By 

WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS, 

Author of " Questionable Shapes," etc. 


A NEW romantic novel founded on the legend of King Robert 
'*■ of Sicily, an arrogant ruler, who defied the priest's warning 
that "the unrighteous shall be debased and the pure in heart shall 
be exalted." He fell into a deep sleep and lost his throne. Upon 
this foundation Mr. McCarthy has constructed a vivid romance, in 
which a beautiful woman is the means of King Robert's eventual 
change of heart and happy restoration to the throne. 
Ornamented Cloth. $1.50. 


The Proud Prince 

By 
JUSTIN HUNTLY McCARTHY, 

Author of 

"If I Were King," "Marjorie," etc. 

(Imprint of R. H. Russell.) 


■"THIS is the story of a wife, who by the unconscious influence of 
* her noble character, finally brought her husband to alter his 
stern conception of justice, and to see the true meaning of human 
charity. The crisis of their lives came through her heroic effort to 
save a young girl from the knowledge of certain behaviour in the 
past of her betrothed, of which he had long repented. The story 
tells how the wife nearly sacrificed her own life to achieve this pur- 
pose, and how, through many strange complications in the lives of 
these people, truth and love finally triumphed.

NEW EDITION OF THE 

Letters of Horace Walpole 

Edited by Mrs. PAGET TOYNBEE 

The Delegates of the Clarendon Press have arranged with Mrs. Paget Toynbee for the 
publication of The Letters of Horace Walpole, in as complete a form as possible. The work is now in the 
press, and will be issued in sixteen volumes. The first portion (vols, i-iv) will be published in November, 
1903; vols, v-x will be ready in November, 1904, and the remainder (vols, xi-xvi) in November, 1905. 

It is confidently expected that this new edition, the first for nearly fifty years, of the greatest English 
letter-writer of the eighteenth (or perhaps of any) century, will be practically final, no pains having been 
spared in tracing letters in the hands of private owners, and in public collections, in this country, in England, 
and on the Continent. 

Mrs. Toynbee has been so fortunate as to obtain the use of over four hundred letters, not included 
in the latest edition of the Collected Letters ; more than a hundred of these have never before been printed. 

The work will be issued in three editions, as follows: 

I. 16 volumes, demy 8vo, on hand-made paper, the number of copies limited to 260, at the 

subscription price of $125.00 net in cloth boards; 

$175.00 net in full morocco.

THE SHADOW OF VICTORY 



By MYRTLE REED 



A Romance of Fort Dearborn (Early Chicago) 

12mo. With Frontispiece. Net, $1.20 (postage 15 eta.) 



Miss Reed's new novel is preeminently a love story, portraying a true woman whose lot was cast, not in the drawing- 
room or in the salon, hut in the wilderness, where the only representatives of civilization and culture were the rude fort and 
the true hearts that garrisoned it. Beatrice is fascinating, possessing all the sweet caprices of Woman, with Woman's strength 
in time of need, while the hero is a man whose character must appeal to every true woman.

HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD: 

" T HAVE read of late few more de-

r^ ORGO is the naive and captivating 
^^ heroine, naming the book, beloved by 
Theramenes, the Athenian, whose stormy 
career in politics, love, and war furnishes 
the motive of the tale. The story is laid in 
a period covering the time of the great 
Peloponnesian conflict, and abounds in strik- 
ing war pictures. Conspicuous historic fig- 
ures of the time, such as Socrates and Alci- 
biades, are delineated in a manner singularly 
lifelike. 



PARISH OF TWO 

BOSTON HERALD says: 
"/^\NE of the most brilliant pieces of

known society man, and Percy Collins, a 
pseudonym which is said to be that of the 
society leader, Price Collier, of New York. 
The book is far above the average in con- 
ception and execution, and will be widely 
read and discussed because of its strong and 
unique plot, its sparkling epigrams, and the 
boldness of its attack on the morality of 
the weaker sex."

BOOKS OF TBS COMING SEASON. 



Once more the publishers have sent oat 
their announcements for the Fall season, and 
once more we attempt to select from the enor- 
mous mass of material thus presented a few 
titles here and there that sharpen anticipation. 
In order to make it possible to choose at all 
from so bewildering an array of forthcoming 
books, we shall set entirely aside the majority 
of the categories represented — science, educa- 
tion, religion, travel, holiday and juvenile pub- 
lications, — and make a scanty selection from 
the groups belonging to biography, history, and 
literature in the narrower sense. 

We presume it will be admitted without 
much question that the book of the year, as 
far as one can determine such a matter in ad- 
vance, will be Mr. Morley's life of Gladstone. 
No man living is better fitted by both knowl- 
edge and sympathy to set forth the life of the 
famous statesman, and Mr. Morley has given 
the greater part of his time ever since Glad- 
stone's death to this pious task. It certainly 
must have been an exacting labor, and we trust 
that it has proved inspiring as well. We may 
certainly depend upon a biography that will do 
justice to Gladstone's great moral and intel- 
lectual force, and to his impressive personal 
qualities, while avoiding the undiscriminating 
eulogy that is not content with the real great- 
ness of the man, but seeks also to claim for 
him a scholarly eminence which cannot pos- 
sibly be allowed by " them that know." The 
figure of Gladstone was so imposing that one 
may dismiss with a smile his ingenious specu- 
lations in theology and archaeology, as well as 
his mistakes in statesmanship, without sensibly 
impairing his significance. 

The great American statesman whose posi- 
tion in public life and whose intellectual bent 
offer many points of comparison with Glad- 
stone may properly be named in the present 
connection, since for American readers the 
autobiography of Senator Hoar cannot fail to 
prove a work of the deepest interest. The 
American Senator, like the English Minister, 
has his marked vagaries, intellectual and po- 
litical, but his earnest stand for righteousness 
in the conduct of the nation's affairs has ex-

alted him above the ordinary rules of criticism, 
and made of him a figure almost as command- 
ing as that of his English contemporary. The 
story of his life, as told by himself, must make 
the strongest kind of an appeal to all serious 
Americans. In literary biography, the forth- 
coming volume of Richard Henry Stoddard's 
memoirs, edited by his lifelong friend Mr. 
Stedman, offers a certain store of entertain- 
ment, as does also the autobiography of Mr. 
John T. Trowbridge, which some of us have 
already seen in the pages of " The Atlantic 
Monthly." The authorized life of John Fiske 
cannot fail to be a work of fascinating inter- 
est, for it is to be told largely from Fiske's own 
letters and private papers. The author of this 
biography is not even named in the announce- 
ment, so completely has he sought to merge his 
own identity in that of his subject. Two other 
biographical works that deserve mention are 
the " Reminiscences of an Astronomer," by 
Professor Simon Newcomb, and Mr. Vizetelly's 
account of the life, work, and influence of Zola. 

Turning from biography to history, we may 
mention first of all the publication of Lord Ac- 
ton's lectures on the French Revolution and on 
modern history in general, delivered during the 
author's incumbency of the Regius professor- 
ship at Cambridge. The Reformation volume 
in the " Cambridge Modern History " will also 
appear in a few weeks. Mr. Herbert Paul is 
writing a five- volume history of modern Eng- 
land — "from the point of view of a young 
man " — and two of the volumes are now ready. 
A similar service is being done for the recent 
history of our own country by Mr. William Gar- 
rott Brown, and the first of the two volumes is 
about to be published. M. Hanotaux's work, 
doing much the same thing for the history of 
contemporary France, will soon be complete in 
four volumes. A few other historical works 
announced are Dr. A. H. Noll's account of the 
struggle for constitutional government in Mex- 
ico, editions of Hennepin's " New Discovery " 
and of the journals of Lewis and Clark, and 
several further volumes in the " Expansion 
of the Republic" and "American Common- 
wealths" series. 

Among works of literary history and criticism 
we shall soon have completed the new edition 
of Chambers's " Cyclopaedia of English Litera- 
ture," the illustrated " English Literature " of 
Messrs. Garnett and Gosse, and Mr. W. J. 
Courthope's " History of English Poetry." No 
less than fifteen new volumes of " English Men 
of Letters "are announced, three of the number 



by American writers upon American subjects. 
Two volumes of " New Letters of Thomas Car- 
lyle " will keep alive for another season the 
unfortunate controversy between his partisans 
and those of his biographer. "America in 
Literature," by Professor Woodberry, is a title 
that attracts us, as do such others as " Studies 
in German Literature in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury," by Professor John F. Coar ; " Dante's 
Influence on English Poetry" and " The Great 
Poets of Italy," both by Professor Oscar Kuhns; 
" A Literary History of Scotland," by Mr. J. H. 
Millar; " The Development of the Drama," by 
Professor Brander Matthews ; and the titles of 
the five forthcoming volumes in the "Colum- 
bia University Studies in Romance Literature 
and Philology." 

The two volumes of poetry that will attract 
most attention are Mr. Kipling's collection, 
"The Five Nations," and the "David and 
Bathsheba " drama by Mr. Phillips. Among 
other announcements, the women seem to make 
the best showing, in witness whereof we mention 
"After Sunset," by Mrs. Rosamund Marriott 
Watson ; " The Siuging Leaves," by Miss Jo- 
sephine Preston Peabody, "The Passing Show," 
by Miss Harriet Monroe ; "Songs of Dreams," 
by Miss Ethel Clifford ; and " Poems," by Miss 
Josephine Daskam. We shall probably have 
some poetical surprises besides, for it has been 
our experience that the most interesting work 
in this kind is apt to come without observation, 
and unheralded by its sponsors. 

Novels, like the poor, we have always with 
us, and the comparison is far-reaching. Of 
the hundreds of titles already announced, we 
select a few for the closing paragraph of the 
present forecast, a task not without its diffi- 
culties. Among those that seem the most prom- 
ising the following may be named : " The 
Crossing," by Mr. Winston Churchill ; " The 
Heart of Rome," by Mr. F. Marion Crawford ; 
" Helianthus," by "Ouida"; "Sanctuary," by 
Mrs. Edith Wharton ; " Cherry," by Mr. Booth 
Tarkington ; " The Ambassadors," by Mr. 
Henry James ; " The Maids of Paradise," by 
Mr. Robert W. Chambers ; " Letters Home," 
by Mr. William Dean Howells ; " The Relent- 
less City," by Mr. E. F. Benson ; " The Long 
Night," by Mr. Stanley Weyman ; " Barlasch 
of the Guard," by Mr. Henry Seton Merriman ; 
" My Friend Prospero," by Mr. Henry Har- 
land; "The Napoleon of Notting Hill," by 
Mr. G. K. Chesterton ; "Where Love Is," by 
Mr. William J. Locke; "The House on the

liverance,"' by Miss Ellen Glasgow ; " The 
Castle of Twilight," by Miss Margaret Horton 
Potter ; " Doctor Xavier," by Mr. Max Pem- 
berton ; " The Vineyard," by " John Oliver 
Hobbes "; and " The Little Shepherd of King- 
dom Come," by Mr. John Fox. Here are an 
even score of which we may be reasonably sure 
that they will not disappoint us, since each is 
the work of a practiced hand, skilled in its 
own peculiar craftsmanship. It is a far cry, 
no doubt, from a novel by Mr. Henry James 
to a novel by " Ouida," but whoever takes up 
either to read will do it with his eyes open, 
knowing about what to expect. 



POE'S CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICAN 
LITERAR Y HIS TOR Y. 



If we may judge from the new editions of Poe 
that have recently been or are about to be put upon 
the market, we may reasonably conclude that Poe's 
day has at last arrived, or at least is within sight. 
Let us, therefore, once more examine his literary 
history and see what ideas he has really contributed 
to the world's stock. 

To the casual reader, Poe is a sort of Mephis- 
topheles. with human weaknesses, who created that 
weird poem "The Raven" and wrote the popular 
detective story "The Gold-Bug." One is pure 
genius, unexplained and unexplainable ; the other, 
clever but somewhat cheap legerdemain. 

To the more careful and thoughtful student, Poe 
offers a bundle of fragments, which afford abundant 
evidence of genius, but are so slight and scattered, 
so imperfect (except in a few instances), that it is 
impossible to accord their author a very high place 
or a very lasting reputation. Not only is his work 
fragmentary, but it is disfigured by extravagance 
and folly of the more pitiable kind. 

But now, more than fifty years after Poe's death 
and nearly a hundred after his birth, we are called 
upon by the Poe enthusiast to reexamine the rec- 
ords, and see if we have not been misled by a series 
of conditions, natural but hostile to appreciation of 
his true worth. 

None can deny that there is some truth in the 
statement that the Literary Powers have been hos- 
tile to Poe. Poe attacked Longfellow violently, 
denied Hawthorne's " originality," finally turned 
against Lowell, and included all the New England 
writers in his sneers at " Frogpondium." Irving 
and Bryant, moreover, according to Poe, were not 
as great as they ought to have been. In a word, 
he set himself against all that we have learned to 
value and consider great in American literature. 
It was hard for any friend of Longfellow to be 
an enthusiastic admirer of Poe. Poe seems to 
force everyone to take sides, — and when sides 
have been taken, we have Poe on one side and 



every other literary man of eminence on the other. 
Professor Woodberry, whose biography of Poe has 
contributed more to our knowledge of the man than 
anything else that has been written, manifestly dis- 
likes Poe. And what critic but has accepted with 
a smile Lowell's epigrammatic characterization, 
Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge " ? 

All this has been like a wall of ice about any 
attempt to examine Poe in the only way in which 
any great author can be fairly examined, namely, 
with the enthusiasm of a lover who is likewise a 
thoroughly intelligent and just critic. Poe has had 
his devoted friends, it is true ; but for the most part 
they have not been endowed with the highest crit- 
ical ability. 

But we have now a younger generation, owning no 
thralldom to the New England writers, and among 
them a number of keen critical minds. Here, then, 
is work for them. Let us outline, briefly, three lead- 
ing points of the inquiry upon which they must enter. 

1. Poe was a most accomplished literary artist. 
He bad a skill that he had learned by patient study 
and practice. This is clearly shown by the improve- 
ment he made in revising his poems and tales. What 
a world of difference, for instance, do we find be- 
tween " A Pean" of 1831 and "Lenore" of 1843, 
though one is but the developed form of the other ! 
Poe never revised but to improve, and he was an 
habitual reviser of all his work. Have we not here, 
then, a conscious literary artist (whose genius none 
can deny), with methods we might study, with the 
closest attention, for the critical principles they 
would reveal ? 

Poe's literary history in this respect is interesting. 
He published his first volume of poems in 1827, the 
same year and at the same age when Tennyson pub- 
lished his contributions to "Poems by Two Broth- 
ers"; and his volumes of 1829 and 1831 correspond 
closely with Tennyson's early volumes of about the 
same dates. Clearly the first two volumes are alto- 
gether experimental; but in the third (1831) we 
find such gems as " To Helen." From this time on, 
Poe never attempted a serious poem without making 
a pronounced artistic success, with the single excep- 
tion of the dramatic poem " Politian," which was a 
further experiment such as "Tamerlane" and "Al 
Aaraaf " had been. What other great poet, after 
he had once learned his art, practised it so rigor- 
ously? Tennyson may be regarded as almost the 
only other one. 

After the volume of poems of 1831, which con- 
tains proof that Poe had really mastered the poetic 
art, he turned his attention to short story writing. 
We hear nothing of him for two years. Then, in 
1833, he appears as the prize winner in the " Balti- 
more Visiter " contest, and he has on hand at least 
half a dozen stories of the first order. 

The French would doubtless accept Poe as the 
father of the art of short story writing in its modern 
development. In his work we find a genus quite 
different from the narrative tales that had prevailed 
until his day. He begins a story with an essay on 



162 



THE DIAL. 



[Sept. 16, 



some peculiarity of the human mind, and then he 
uses his dramatic plot to illustrate it. In his review 
of Hawthorne, he explains the principle analytically : 

"A skilful artist, has constructed a tale. He has not 
fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents, but 
having deliberately conceived a certain single tfftct to be 
wrought, he then invents such incidents, he then combines 
such events, and discusses them in such tone, as may best 
serve him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very 
first sentence tend not to the out-bringing of this effect, then 
in his very first step he has committed a blunder. In the 
whole composition there should be no word written of which 
the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre- 
established design. And by such means, with such care and 
skill, a picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind 
of him who contemplates it with a kindred art, a sense of the 
fullest satisfaction. The idea of the tale, its thesis, has been 
presented unblemished, because undisturbed — an end abso- 
lutely demanded, yet, in the novel, altogether unattainable." 

Of course Poe means " in the novel " of the great 
English writers, such as those of Scott, Dickens, 
and Thackeray, each with its two or three hundred 
thousand words, rambling along a path the end of 
which not even the author himself could see. 

2. A phrase in the paragraph quoted above sug- 
gests another point for our study of Poe. He speaks 
of " him who contemplates it with a kindred art." 
If this means anything, it means that the reading 
public must be educated in the principles of literary 
art if artistic creations are to have any value. 

There have been few hitherto to point out Poe's 
devotion to and permanent interest in the American 
reading public. While English and French writers 
have lamented bitterly that Poe was not born some- 
where, anywhere, not in America, we find in Poe's 
own writing not one word of complaint, not one 
expression of a wish that he had been, or might be, 
anything but an American. 

His magazine project, to which he devoted him- 
self so strenuously throughout his life, — was not that 
much more than an ambitious desire to make money ? 
Poe's real passion was to establish a periodical that 
would educate the American reading public criti- 
cally to appreciate the best in literature, since he 
believed that only with such an educated audience 
could the best works of literary art be produced. 
No other American writer ever devoted himself so 
unselfishly and passionately and persistently to so 
noble an artistic cause. Poe justly accuses Long- 
fellow of literary indolence in " Hyperion," a novel 
totally at variance with the literary principle of 
unity enunciated by Poe in the paragraph previously 
quoted. He says : 

" Works like this . . . are potent in unsettling the popular 
faith in Art — a faith which, at no day more than the present, 
needed the support of men of letters. ... A man of trne 
talent who would demur at the great labour requisite for the 
stern demands of high art — at the unremitting toil and 
patient elaboration which, when soul-guided, result in the 
beauty of Unity, Totality, Truth, — men, we say, who would 
demur at such labour, make no scruple of scattering at ran- 
dom a profusion of rich thought in the pages of such farragos 
as ' Hyperion.' " 

And he ends his review sadly, — "We are indig- 
nant that he [Li ngfellow] too has been recreant to 
the good cause." Poe was faithful unto death. 



3. Poe was first poet, then story-writer and edu- 
cator of the reading public ; finally, toward the close 
of his life, he turned his attention toward a great 
scientific subject, — rather, toward the substance 
of all science, — a conception of the totality of the 
universe. Such scientific stories as " Hans Pfaal " 
and " The Conversation of Charmion and Eiros " 
are light ; and while they serve their purpose, they 
are somewhat fanciful. In " Eureka " Poe made 
a profoundly serious effort, which has never been 
properly studied, and indeed has usually been 
looked on as a curiosity in the literary garret, not 
unlike the flying machine of Darius Green. 

In studying this side of Poe's literary history, 
we must bear in mind, first, that Poe was not a 
scientist, but a literary man, and " Eureka " he 
specifically calls a " prose poem." When he says 
it is "Truth," he does not mean, as Professor 
Woodberry supposes he does, that he believes him- 
self a great scientist and metaphysical thinker, but 
rather that he feels the sublimity of his subject and 
has studied it with the serious reverence which 
Truth requires. There are various kinds of truth, 
and the truth Poe aims at is of a literary, not a 
scientific, character, — that is, it is touched with 
imagination and sentiment. Whether Poe was suc- 
cessful or not in "Eureka," he at any rate gives 
us an ideal of loftiness and immensity as the proper 
subject-matter of literature, and a hint as to how the 
plodding investigations of science may be utilized 
for the most ideal purposes. 

Science has made such immense strides since 
Poe's day that we cannot hold him responsible for 
any inaccuracies or shortcomings in statements of 
scientific truths; but the present writer believes 
that the thoughtful student will find in " Eureka " 
the germs of that modern philosophy which has 
fully reconciled the material and the spiritual, dis- 
covering in mind, matter, God, and man, an unas- 
sailable Unity. In any case, the method of thought, 
the poetic conception, can never be affected by our 
changing knowledge, for they belong to the perma- 
nence, the immortality, of genius. 

We have not yet exhausted Poe. There has 
been but little really sympathetic study of him as 
yet, and therefore no real or permanently valuable 
comprehension of him. Curious circumstances have 
retarded his vogue. Now that those circumstances 
have passed away, we may look forward with re- 
newed hope of his finding his true place in our lit- 
erary history. Sherwin Cody.

Napoleon at St. Helena.* 



When Napoleon was a student at the Acad- 
emy of Lyons he gained a prize for the best 
essay on " The Truths and Principles that 
ought to be Inculcated on Men that they may 
Enjoy Happiness." The prize was a gold 
medal, which he afterward sold for fifty louis. 
Years later, Talleyrand obtained this youthful 
composition from the Lyons Academy and laid 
it before the Emperor. "Have you read it?" 
asked the latter. " No, Sire, I have just re- 
ceived it." Thereupon Napoleon took the pa- 
per and threw it into the fire, pushing it down 
with the tongs. Talleyrand betrayed some sur- 
prise, but the other was determined that what 
he had written in the generous enthusiasm of 
youth should not be allowed to put him to 
shame as Emperor. 

This anecdote, recorded by General Gour- 
gaud, in his volume of " Talks of Napoleon at 
St. Helena," furnishes food for reflection, as do 
many other of the reminiscences contained in 
his journal. The gleams of light thrown on 
the great man's character, the fresh revelations 
of his moral and intellectual peculiarities, are 
what most engages the interest in these new 
conversations at St. Helena. Of secondary 
importance are those purely historical recollec- 
tions of the illustrious captive, confirming or 
contradicting what has already been chronicled 
concerning his career. To the book as a pic- 
ture, however imperfect, of Napoleon's most 
intimate personality, the present reviewer ac- 
cordingly wishes to call attention in the brief 
space at his disposal. But first as to Gourgaud 
himself and his claims upon our confidence. 

Gaspard Gourgaud was born of humble par- 
entage in 1783. At nineteen he entered upon 
a military career, in which he distinguished 
himself for bravery, having the good fortune 
to save Napoleon's life at Brienne in 1814. 
He had already advanced rapidly in the favor 
of the Emperor, who said of him in later life: 
" He was my First Orderly Officer. He is my 
work. He is my son." And there was a sin- 
cere attachment between the two. Hence it 
was natural that Gourgaud, at his own earnest 
request, should be chosen by Napoleon as

Baron Gourgaud. Together with the Journal kept hy

one of the companions of his exile. But the 
irksomeness of inactivity told severely on the 
young soldier's temper, and his own record 
shows him to have been of a petulant, moody, 
uneven disposition, which may perhaps some- 
what impair his authority as a chronicler of 
passing events. Yet the artless candor of his 
style insures us against wilful deception. Lord 
Rosebery calls his journal, which appears not 
to have been written for publication, " the one 
capital and superior record of life at St. Hel- 
ena," and, again, speaks of it as " sometimes 
almost brutal in its realism." It was not until 
1898 that the journal was published, by per- 
mission of Gourgaud's son. Forming as it does, 
in the French, a work of twelve hundred pages, 
it is too prolix for unabridged reproduction in 
English. By judicious excision a book of one- 
quarter that bulk has now been produced. 
It is worth noting that the publication of 
these memoirs clears up some hitherto misun- 
derstood points relating to Gourgaud and his 
conduct toward Napoleon at St. Helena. A 
pretended quarrel with his imperial master was 
meant to throw dust in the eyes of the English 
and lead the way to the prisoner's escape from 
the island. 

Let us now follow the fallen conqueror as 
he proceeds, on board the " Northumberland," 
and in charge of Admiral Cockburn, to his 
insular domain. " Ah, if it were only to be 
done over again!" is his pathetic exclamation, 
referring to Waterloo. Choosing somewhat at 
random from his talks with Gourgaud, we find 
him looking back upon his First Consulship as 
a happy period in his life. He was also happy 
upon the birth of the King of Rome, though 
he did not then feel perfectly secure in his 
position. But he thinks perhaps he was hap- 
piest at Tilsit, when, after surmounting many 
difficulties, he found himself dictating laws and 
receiving the homage of emperors and kings. 
The remembrance of his Italian victories, too, 
gives him satisfaction. What cries of " Long 
live the Liberator of Italy ! " and all that, when 
he was only twenty-five ! Then first did he 
perceive what he might some day become, and 
he seemed to see the whole world passing be- 
neath him as if he had been borne aloft in the 
air. Looking into the future, he speaks of 
Russia as the power most to be dreaded by 
England, and even likely to march, safely and 
swiftly, to universal dominion, first making 
herself mistress of the Orient. This opinion 
he repeats again and again. He regards the 
part he played in history as one that would

have been played by someone else if he had 
not come. Europe was weary of anarchy, and 
an end of it was desired. " A man is only a 
man," he says. " His power is nothing if cir- 
cumstances and public sentiment do not favor 
him." And so he regards Luther and the 
Reformation merely as products of the times. 
Less sage are his reflections on the origin of 
man. In fact, they are so incredibly absurd 
that one is tempted to believe him falsely re- 
ported. After referring to the beginnings of 
civilization in Egypt and India and China, he 
continues : 

" All this leads me to think that the world is not so 
very old, at least as inhabited by man, and within one 
or two thousand years I am disposed to accept the 
chronology appended to the sacred writings. I think 
that man was formed by the heat of the sun acting 
upon mud. Herodotus tells us that in his time the 
slime of the Nile changed into rats, and that they could 
be seen in process of formation." 

Again and again Napoleon refers to Jose- 
phine, betraying considerable feeling for her 
and much regret that she could not have borne 
him a son. 

" She was full of grace — a woman in every sense of 
the word. She always began by saying ' no ' to every- 
thing, merely that she might gain time to consider her 
final answer; then she would say, 'ah! yes, Monsieur.' 
She- seldom told the truth, but there was something 
charming about her equivocations. I may say that she 
was the woman I have the most really loved. She knew 
me thoroughly. She never asked me to do anything 
for her children. She never begged me for money, but 
she made debts by the million. She had bad teeth, but 
was so careful of showing them that few people per- 
ceived them. She was the wife who would have gone 
with me to Elba." 

Amid much gossip and tittle-tattle, indica- 
tive of anything but a noble mind, there are 
some interesting references to persons about 
whom one always likes to read. Of Queen 
Louisa of Prussia, whom he calls " a cultivated 
and superior woman," and of her husband, 
Frederick William III., whom he styles a 
booby, Napoleon says : 

" The Queen of Prussia was a much superior woman 
to the Queen of Bavaria; but she came to Tilsit too 
late. The king would not summon her until he saw he 
could get nothing from me; but everything by the time 
she came had been settled. I went to call on her, but 
she received me in the tragic style, like Chimene in 
The Cid: <Sire! Justice! Justice! Magdeburg!' She 
went on in this way, and greatly embarrassed me. At 
last to make her stop I begged her to sit down, know- 
ing that nothing is so likely to cut short a tragic scene, 
for when one is seated its continuance turns it into a 
comedy. . . . 

" The King of Prussia was a real booby. Every time 
he came to see me to talk over important affairs, he 
never managed to say anything on the subject. He 
went off about shakos, buttons, skin haversacks, and a 



lot of other nonsense, while I did not know a word 
about such trifling military details." 

Here the translator appends a footnote saying 
that " it is a little remarkable that not one of 
the sovereigns who met to confer on the affairs 
of Europe at Tilsit had a son and heir. Na- 
poleon and Alexander had no legitimate chil- 
dren ; the Emperor of Austria and the King 
of Prussia had no sons." Where, pray, at this 
time (1807) was the boy afterward known to 
history as Frederick William IV.? October 
15, 1795, is the commonly accepted date of 
his birth, and no breath of scandal has yet 
tarnished the fair name of his mother, Queen 
Louisa. 

Amusingly frank are Napoleon's character- 
izations of some of his contemporaries. He 
does not spare even his own kith and kin. "I 
made a great mistake," he says, " in putting that 
fool of a Joseph on the Spanish throne." "He 
knows nothing. He likes to enjoy himself." 
His brother Louis he calls a booby, and says 
that in his essays in authorship he was inspired 
by the devil. Comparing his two empresses, 
he calls Marie- Louise as sincere as Josephine 
was diplomatic. The latter would never ac- 
knowledge her age. According to her chro- 
nology, her son Eugene must have been twelve 
years old at birth! Marie-Louise was afraid 
of ghosts and insisted on having five or six 
lighted candles all night in her room. She was 
regarded by Napoleon as having much more 
ability than the Emperor of Austria, her father. 
Still alluding to her, Napoleon declares, " It 
was my having wedded a princess of Austria 
that ruined me. How could I have supposed 
that Austria would act as she has done? " It 
will be noticed that Napoleon found a new rea- 
son every day to account for his downfall. 

Coming down to the last act in his military 
career, he says : 

" I made a great mistake in employing Ney. He 
lost his head. A sense of his past conduct impaired his 
energy. Carnot did not wish me even to make him a 
peer. Had I acted wisely I should have placed Soult 
on the left, but who would have thought that Ney, who 
had spoken to me (you heard him, Gourgaud) of the 
importance of Quatre Bras, would have omitted to oc- 
cupy that position ? . . . I ought to have given Suchet 
the command I gave to Grouchy. More vigor and 
promptness were needed than Grouchy had as a gen- 
eral; he was good only at a splendid charge of cavalry, 
while Suchet had more fire and knew better my way of 
making war. . . . With twenty thousand men less than 
I had we ought to have won the battle of Waterloo. 
But it was Fate that made me lose it. . . . It was the 
good discipline of the English that gained the day."

itary matters, one chapter to anecdotes and

miscellaneous sayings, and another, the last, 
to religion. Of the miscellaneous observa- 
tions, one at least we may be sure came from 
the heart, — " Deliberative bodies are terrible 
things for a sovereign." Regarding man merely 
as " slime warmed by the sun and vivified by 
electric currents," Napoleon cannot be ex- 
pected to edify us by his remarks on religion. 
" If I had to choose a religion," he declares, 
" I think I should become a worshipper of the 
sun. The* sun gives to all things life and fer- 
tility. It is the true God of the earth." 

Gourgaud's journal forms a noteworthy ad- 
dition to Napoleonic literature of the personal 
and gossippy sort, and the translator has done 
her part well. But in abridging and re- 
arranging she has inadvertently repeated a 
passage (on the origin of man) which appears 
on both page 69 and page 277. Her foot- 
notes and explanatory additions to the text 
are excellent, as a rule, and show her to be 
fully at home in her subject — as, indeed, was 
to be expected from her previous studies and 
training. She was herself, as she records, an 
eye-witness of the second funeral of Napoleon 
in 1840. Percy F. Bicksell. 



Shakespeare Criticism and Discussiox.* 

The publication of the great " Elizabethan 
Shakspere," to comprise about forty volumes, 
edited by Mr. Mark Harvey Liddell, is begun 
with a volume on " The Tragedie of Macbeth." 
Two hundred and fifty copies, at $12.50, are 
to be sold only to those who subscribe for the 
entire set. The first volume is a very attract- 
ive piece of book-making. The size is quarto. 
The typical page shows a portion of the text 
of the play printed in the beautiful " Renner " 
type designed by Mr. De Vinne. The editor's 
comments are set in smaller type as a frame to 
the text, above, at one side, and below. It has 
not been possible, however, to carry out com- 
pletely the plan of having the notes to each 
passage printed on the same page as the pas-

sage itself, and sometimes the leaf must be 
turned to find the desired comment. The large 
italic letter used in the general introduction is 
an exceptional combination of grace and legi- 
bility. The claim of the publishers that the 
book is "perhaps the most beautiful volume 
ever made in the United States " may well be 
justified if typographical charm be made the 
standard of beauty. 

Perhaps no other feature of this sumptuously 
printed book is so attractive to the special 
student as the attempt "to give as accurately 
as possible the exact shade of meaning which 
Shakspere's words had at the time they were 
written." Mr. Liddell especially delights to 
point out that passages have often been treated 
as " corrupt " solely because of the ignorance 
of editors and commentators. 

Mr. Liddell has made careful use of the 
earlv dictionaries of modern English, and es- 
pecially of the "New English Dictionary," 
more than half of which has now appeared. 

It does not fall within the plan of the work 
to give much direct attention to aesthetic criti- 
cism ; but in the introductory notes to the sep- 
arate scenes, and in many brief comments, the 
editor shows admirable penetration, sugges- 
tiveness, and good taste. He thoroughly ap- 
preciates this tragedy, " which in respect to 
unity and tenseness of interest is unequalled in 
the history of literature " (p. xx). A single 
sentence is here quoted from an admirable 
comment on Macbeth's speech to Lady Mac- 
beth at the close of III. ii. : 

"With a few touches of association, — and it is mar- 
vellous how few they are : the deepening light, the 
cawing rooks, plants and animals drooping and drow- 
sing to healthy rest while the mysterious forces of 
darkness stir themselves to their nightly activity, — 
Shakspere tunes Macbeth's soul into unison with the 
mysterious powers of evil that fly by night." 

Mr. Liddell finds the scene between the wife 
and son of Macduff (in IV. ii.) so unsatisfac- 
tory that some parts of it " could hardly have 
been written by one who imagined the scene 
between Arthur and Herbert" [Hubert, " King 
John," IV. i.]. But Shakespeare could make 
artistic mistakes of this kind. Little Mamillius 
of " The Winter's Tale " in part fails to charm 
us just where charm is imperatively demanded 
(II. i. 1-32). 

At some points objections and criticisms 
must be made. The price put upon the vol- 
ume is staggering. Such a method of publica- 
tion seems almost the ideal way to get the work 
into the wrong hands. The valuable matter 
here presented will be almost equally inacces-

sible to the scholars of moderate means who 
do not own the book and to many of the rich 
book-fanciers who do. 

The text is neither that of the First Folio, 
nor the same put into modern English. In 
the opening scene of eleven lines there are at 
least twenty-one departures from the text of the 
Folio ; two of them are " th' set of sunne " 
and " th' fogge," where the Folio prints " the ". 
The suggestions of the various editors concern- 
ing the text are indicated occasionally, but not 
systematically. There is usually nothing to 
show what stage-directions are in the original, 
and what are modern. 

The passages in Holinshed which are the 
source of this play are printed only incident- 
ally and partially, in scattered bits. They 
should have been given in full. The passage 
concerning " Macbeth " in Forman's diary is 
reprinted only in part. Forman's statement 
that, when he saw the play acted, Macbeth and 
Banquo entered at I. iii. 37, " Ridinge thorowe 
a wod " (these words are not cited by Mr. 
Liddell), seems to show that they were on horse- 
back, i. e., on hobby-horses. The use of these 
awkward representations of horses seems to be 
carefully avoided in the case of the struggle in 
which Banquo meets his death (III. iii. 11-14). 
Professor Manly's excellent school edition of 
this play reprints all the desired material from 
Holinshed and Forman. 

An alphabetical bibliography is much needed. 
Since there is no entry in the index under 
"Phipson," such a direction as "see Phipson" 
(p. 147) may provoke some reader to language 
M not loud but deep." 

A number of comments will now be given 
which illustrate the great value of this new 
edition. Citations follow the Globe text so far 
as the interpretations given permit. 

" Thou 'ldst have, great Glamis, 
That which cries ' Thus thou must do ' if thou have it, 
And that which rather thou dost fear to do 
Than wishest should be undone " (I. v. 23-26). 

"None of the emendations and explanations clears 
away the difficulty, which seems to lie in an Eliza- 
bethan dirb koivov construction by which cries is first 
used in its sense of ' exclaiming ' and is then understood 
in its other Elizabethan sense of « demanding ' with a 
direct object after it." 

The editor finds a similar zeugmatic construc- 
tion in the much-emended passage, — 

" I am young, but something 
You may discern of him through me, and wisdom 
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb 
To appease an angry god" (IV. iii. 14-17). 

This is taken to mean " You may perceive 
[discern] what sort of a man Macbeth is from 



my experience, and learn from me [discern] 
the wisdom of offering up," etc. A number 
of these strikiug zftugmatic constructions are 
pointed out in "Macbeth"; the editor holds 
that they have led to a whole crop of uncalled 
for " emendations and assumptions of cor- 
ruptness." 

" To be thus is nothing 
But to be safely thus" (III. i. 48-9). 

This is found to be only a normal Elizabethan 
idiom, the last words meaning "if I cannot be 
what I am in security and without fear." 
" Rather than so, come fate into the list, 
And champion me to the utterance ! " (III. i. 71-2). 

"There can be little doubt that Macbeth means that 
fate is to be his champion to maintain his royal title 
against all comers, and not Banquo's champion . . . 
Fate in Elizabethan English is used of death, destruc- 
tion, ruin . . . Here death and ruin are to be Macbeth's 
champions and maintain his claim to the crown < e'en till 
destruction sicken.' The words are not a challenge to 
destiny : Macbeth is not ready for that until the end of 
the play." 

" Revenges burn in them ; for their dear causes 
Would to the bleeding, and the grim alarm 
Excite the mortified man" (V. ii. 3-5). 

The editor accepts none of the previous expla- 
nations, offering instead the following ingen- 
ious but venturesome interpretation : 
"Revenges burn in them: I say burn, because they 
suffer from a fever which needs to be bled, and war's 
stern alarm must furnish the furious incitement to 
rouse from its lethargy their lifeless manhood, so long 
crushed under the heel of the tyrant." 

The comments upon the following expres- 
sions show Mr. Liddell at his best : " in such 
bloody distance " (= enmity), III. i. 116 ; 
"the perfect spy o' the time," III. i. 130 
(Johnson's view, that we have here a reference 
to the mysterious third murderer, is accepted); 
" upon his aid," III. vi. 30 ; " Fillet of a fenny 
snake," IV. i. 12; 

" the chance of goodness 
Be like our warranted quarrel ! " (IV. iii. 136-7). 

(= « May our chance of good success be as 
sure as our cause is just.") 

Apparently this editor is the first to note 
that the " farmer that hanged himself on 
th' expectation of plenty " (II. iii. 5-6) is an 
allusion to the character of Sordido in Ben 
Jonson's " Every Man out of his Humour," 
1699, III. vii. The reasons which have con- 
vinced many that Scene V. of Act III. was 
not written by Shakespeare are forcefully and 
adequately stated. 

Mr. Liddell defends convincingly the suc- 
cessive accents of the line, 

" Toad, that under cold stone " (IV. i. 6), 
against the emendations of normalizing editors. 
He also recognizes that the line

THE DIAL

" Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me : enough." (IV. i. 72), 

ends with a three-syllabled measure. But in 
general he is violently opposed to three-syllabled 
measures, and resorts to desperate surgical 
operations to cure them. Such pronunciations 
as " harb'ger " (p. 33), " pit'ful " (110, 181), 
"laud'ble" (167), and "conf'dent" (210), 
seem incredible. 

Macbeth is said to be "essentially mad when 
his acts and words are viewed in the light of 
Elizabethan psychology" (p. xxiv). This opin- 
ion, though oft repeated, need not be taken too 
seriously, since the following passage shows 
that all of Shakespeare's greatest tragic char- 
acters " are as mad as he ": 

" Macbeth's insanity, like Hamlet's, is but suggested 
to the reader: Shakspere is too much of a poet to de- 
clare explicitly what insanity is, or to label Lear, Ham- 
let, Othello, and Macbeth as mad. They have all ' a 
feaver of the madde ' in them that lifts them out of the 
common range of experience and makes them inter- 
esting" (p. 200). 

Mr. Liddell holds that the knocking at the 
gate, in II. ii., " cannot be that which is the 
subject of the Porter's soliloquy in the scene 
that follows." But how does Mr. Liddell know 
that it is not the same ? And how can the au- 
dience learn that it is not ? 

Professor Manly's view of the passage con- 
cerning the touching for the king's evil (IV. 
iii. 140-159) is that, while it may have been 
intended to please James, " it is quite as prob- 
able that it was intended to please the audience 
at the Globe, by supporting the patriotic theory 
of the origin of the healing touch." This sug- 
gestion is not mentioned by Mr. Liddell. 

Many other matters call for notice, bat space 
forbids. 

Schmidt's " Shakespeare- Lexicon " appeared 
in 1874-5. The second edition, 1885, was 
properly "a mere reimpression "; the editor 
confined his attention "to the correction of mis- 
prints and to some small additions for which 
room could be got by expunging what seemed 
less important." The third edition, revised by 
Professor Sarrazin, is now to be considered. 

The one striking new feature is a Supple- 
ment of thirty pages, containing "a selection 
of new renderings and interpretations." These 
have been taken, for the most part, from En- 
glish scholars, " the most legitimate commen- 
tators of the great English poet." In each case 
an asterisk has been inserted in the original 
article calling attention to the supplementary 
matter. Also, about twenty-six lines have been 
added to Part II. of the Appendix, "Provin- 



cialisms "; and nearly twice as many have been 
inserted in brackets here and there in Part III., 
" Words and sentences taken from foreign lan- 
guages." These items seem to comprise all the 
additions to the second edition. 

Schmidt's Lexicon was recognized from the 
beginning as a remarkable piece of work. One 
might sometimes differ from the editor in opin- 
ion, but the material was all gathered, and it 
was usually well explained. The present re- 
viewer once erroneously charged Schmidt with 
having failed to cite under " for to " the line 
in " The Taming of the Shrew ": 
" For to supply the places at the table." (III. ii., 249.) 

But the omission was noted in the " additions 
and corrections." However, the same expres- 
sion in the grave-digger's song in " Hamlet " 
(" a pit of clay for to be made," V. i. 104) is 
not yet cited. Richard Grant White made the 
use of " for to " an important consideration in 
forming his opinion as to Shakespeare's prob- 
able relation to the two older plays on which 
Parts II. and III. of " King Henry VI." were 
based. Since White never acknowledged the 
value of Schmidt's work, it is well to point out 
that if it had been in existence when he wrote 
his " Essay on the Authorship of Henry VI." 
it could have saved him from the mistake of 
saying that Shakespeare never uses " this un- 
couth old idiom "for to. 

White's detailed criticism of the first edition 
of Schmidt was reprinted in his "Studies in 
Shakespeare," pp. 300-363. It seems very 
strange that even this third edition pays no 
attention to many valuable corrections and im- 
provements there suggested, although Professor 
Sarrazin mentions " Grant White " as one from 
whom help has been received. Omitting all 
cases where the American scholar may be 
thought hypercritical, his comments on the fol- 
lowing words should certainly have been taken 
to heart : buckle, lapsed, quill, bacon, beadle, 
Billingsgate, boy (verb), castle (in " my old 
lad of the castle "), crestless, Hob, organ-pipe, 
pregnant (in " crook the pregnant binges of 
the knee," " Hamlet," III., ii., 66), shent, step- 
mother. The definition of clear-stories should 
be much improved now that we have the " New 
English Dictionary." There are too many sub- 
divisions of meaning in treating such words as 
about, to be, to bear; but this can hardly be 
remedied until an edition is made from new 
plates. 

It is to be hoped that the new matter in 
this third edition can be purchased in separate 
form. Schmidt said, in the preface to the

[Sept. 16, 



second edition : "It ought to be a law in the 
republic of letters that essential changes in 
books should be separately published in the 
form of supplements." 

"The author did not revise these hastily 
written lectures, and they were penned under 
heavy stress of the illness that was closing in 
upon him, and with no idea of their inclusion 
in a book." This statement concerning Sidney 
Lanier's " Shakspere and his Forerunners " 
fairly disarms criticism, and at the same time 
suggests some inevitable shortcomings in the 
work. The reviewer will therefore turn at once 
to features which seem to him interesting and 
helpful. 

The work is not at all similar to J. A. 
Symonds's standard book, " Shakespeare's 
Predecessors in the English Drama." The 
" forerunners " of Shakespeare here discussed 
include all those poets and poems, from "Beo- 
wulf " down to the death of the dramatist, that 
Lanier chooses to bring into connection with 
Shakespeare by reason of any contrast or re- 
semblance. The sonnet-makers, from Surrey 
to Shakespeare, receive four out of the entire 
twenty-four chapters. Many sonnets are an- 
alysed and interpreted with great delicacy and 
skill. Lanier's declaration that "every sonnet 
should be a little drama " seems fanciful, but 
it is so expounded as to be very illuminating 
(I. 189-193). 

Chapters XIII. and XIV. (Vol. II.) discuss 
" The Music of Shakspere's Time " very 
agreeably, and presumably with as much ac- 
curacy as is practicable in a popular presenta- 
tion. In chapters XX. and XXI. the gradual 
changes in Shakespeare's versification are ex- 
plained, and their significance is well brought 
out. A few words on the omnipresence of lit- 
erature (p. xiv.), a passage concerning Nature- 
communion (I., 72-3), and one that depicts a 
bird building its nest (I., 88), are commended 
to all lovers of Lanier. 

These volumes are very fully illustrated, 
and their external appearance is beautiful in 
every way. The illustrations are interesting and 
valuable, and it must have cost much trouble 
and expense to secure them. The reviewer 
wishes to offer some suggestions concerning 
them that may be of service in a second edition. 
The value of the illustrations is often much les- 
sened by the fact that sufficient information 
about them is not given. At p. 40 of the first 
volume, what is called a facsimile from an 
" Anglo-Saxon MS." shows a passage written 



in Latin. The illustration at p. 76 is a repro- 
duction of p. 50 of Thorpe's edition (1842) of 
the "Codex Exoniensis " or "Exeter Book"; 
that at p. 100 comes from p. 293 of the same 
book. At p. 162 there is " a page from Lay- 
amon's ' Brut,' " — but from which MS. ? Con- 
cerning each portrait of an individual author, 
one wishes to know the source from which it 
was obtained. When undated title-pages are 
reproduced in facsimile, the date of publica- 
tion, exact or approximate, should be given 
(pp. 224, 232). 

The so-called picture of "Shakspere's 
house at Stratford" (Vol. II., p. 74) is not 
the birthplace, which is commonly given this 
name. It seems to be a representation of 
Shakespeare's last home, " New Place "; and 
since the best that Halliwell-Phillipps could do 
for us in the "Outlines" (II., 132) was to 
reproduce the building of 1702, this picture is 
probably imaginary, having no authority what- 
ever. The facts about the illustration should 
have been clearly stated. The pictures of " a 
poticary and a pardoner" (p. 102) are from the 
Ellesmere MS. of Chaucer's " Canterbury 
Tales." Between pp. 104 and 113, five pic- 
tures are marked as "from the ' Coventry Mys- 
teries.' " This phrase is decidedly unfortunate, 
since a cloud of misunderstanding has already 
gathered about the name " Coventry Mys- 
teries." These five illustrations are from 
Thomas Sharp's " Dissertation on the Pageants 
or Dramatic Mysteries anciently performed at 
Coventry " (1825), where some interesting in- 
formation about them may be found. The serio- 
comic picture of the mouth and the interior of 
hell (p. 108), for example, is taken from a 
fresco in " the chancel of the Chapel of the 
Holy Cross at Stratford-upon-Avon, discovered 
in 1804, during a reparation of it." The pic- 
ture called " A Soul in Torment," at p. 112, 
has been misunderstood. It is a " representa- 
tion of Israel Van Mechlin's curious and rare 
copy of the print of the Temptation of St. 
Anthony, by Martin Schoen " (Sharp, p. 60). 
The illustration designated " Morris-dancers " 
(p. 120) is exceptionally valuable. It is a pic- 
ture of " Toilet's painted window," assigned by 
Douce (Illustrations of Shakespeare, II., 445) 
to about 1460-70, and thought to be the oldest 
known representation of a May-game with the 
morris-dance. The early plan of the Bank- 
side at p. 124 is omitted from the introductory 
" list of illustrations." The picture of " Richard 
Tarleton, Actor in Shakesperes Plays " is 
thus endorsed on the original that is here

reproduced ; but since that famous comedian, 
who was able to make the people laugh exceed- 
ingly " when he first peept out his head," died 
in 1588, the claim cannot be admitted. Mar- 
stons " Tragedies and Comedies " are called 
Pen Jonsoris at p. 148, — apparently because 
the name " Ben Jonson " is written across the 
title-page there reproduced. 

Such a book as this should never be pub- 
lished without an index ; however, the table of 
contents is exceptionally full. 

The purpose of Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt's 
"Shakespear " is to give" the private and liter- 
ary history " of the dramatist. The author 
thinks that Mr. Sidney Lee has " dealt in- 
completely with some biographical points" in 
his life of the poet, and M has left numerous 
others absolutely untouched." Later, we are 
told that the modern editions of Shakespeare, 
" including the Globe and Clarendon Press one- 
volume issues, are disgracefully executed in an 
editorial sense." These attacks upon works of 
thorough scholarship do not prejudice one in 
favor of the production before us ; and a fuller 
examination makes it clear that Mr. Hazlitt's 
book is not likely to replace Mr. Lee's in 
general favor. 

The present work is less systematic in 
arrangement than Mr. Lee's life, and offers 
but six pages of index where that has thirty. 
Among the plays of Shakespeare, only " Titus 
Andronicus " and " Macbeth " (one reference) 
appear in Mr. Hazlitt's index — a really ab- 
surd state of things. 

Mr. Hazlitt constantly makes statements for 
which no authority is given. Thus, we learn of 
Shakespeare's annoyance at the piracy of 
" Jaggard in the case of the Passionate 
Pilgrim " (p. xxvii.), but we are not given the 
detailed information that is properly desired. 
Farther statements are made on pp. 59-61 ; 
but a clear and scholarly presentation of the 
matter, such as that given on pp. 182-3 of 
Mr. Lee's " Life," is nowhere found. 

Mr. Hazlitt offers conjectures about the 
life-history of the dramatist with striking free- 
dom. One of the more probable of these is the 
suggestion that Shakespeare, while living in 
Stratford, was an occasional spectator at dra- 
matic entertainments (p. 6). But what shall 
we say of the following ? " There is no precise 
account [of the poet's life before his marriage], 
no domestic clues even of the slenderest kind to 
assist us, save the warrantable inference that 
once, or possibly more than once, he visited 



London as a mere boy, and met with the Bur- 
bages and Tarlton the actor" (p. 12). 

Mr. Hazlitt is a literary student and anti- 
quary of wide reading and multifarious infor- 
mation. His book furnishes many suggestions 
and side-lights for scholars of some attainment ; 
it cannot be called a good handbook for begin- 
ners or for ready reference.

Impressions of Poland.* 



For over thirty years, Dr. Georg Brandes 
has been recognized by European scholarship 
as one of the keenest thinkers at work in the 
field of literary criticism. The range of his 
studies, the acuteness of his observation, and the 
brilliancy of his style, offer a combination of 
qualities rarely met with in a critic, and in the 
case of Dr. Brandes these qualities are united 
with a judgment which, if not always entirely 
sound, is always sufficiently reasoned to com- 
mand respectful attention. It is not, however, 
until recent years that this strong and interest- 
ing writer has been properly brought before the 
English-reading public, and it is only within the 
last few months that he may be said to have 
secured an adequate presentation. The first 
of his works to be given us were his study of 
Lord Beaconsfield,and a selection, made by Pro- 
fessor K. B. Anderson, of his miscellaneous crit- 
ical essays. When his great work on Shake- 
speare was published about five years ago, it 
could not be ignored by the translator, and was 
promptly put into English. His "Main Cur- 
rents," the most extensive and important of his 
works, after waiting more than a quarter of a 
century for a translator, is at last being brought 
out in English, volume after volume. His studies 
of Ibsen and Bjornson (partly included in Pro- 
fessor Anderson's volume) have received com- 
plete translation within very recent years, and 
his long-promised history of modern Scandina- 
vian literature, written for the series edited by 
Mr. Gosse, cannot now be long delayed. At 
the present writing, we have before us a trans- 
lation of his " Indtryk fra Polen" (Impres- 
sions from Poland), which is one of the most 
deeply interesting of all his writings. 

This work is made up of five parts. Four 
of them are the records of as many visits to Po- 
land, made between 1885 and 1899; the fifth 
is a study of " The Romantic Literature of Po- 

* Poland. A Study of the Land, People, and Literature.

land in the Nineteenth Century," to which the 
date of 1886 is assigned. Altogether, the vol- 
ume offers us a fascinating mixture of history, 
philosophy, literary criticism and personal ex- 
perience ; it is a volume almost as difficult to 
lay aside, when once started upon, as a novel 
of the more thrilling sort. 

The sympathetic standpoint of all this dis- 
cussion may be illustrated by the following 
extract : 

" Poland, in the historical development of nations, 
has become synonymous with the right of mankind to 
civil and intellectual freedom and with the right of 
nations to independence. Poland is synonymous with our 
hope or our illusion as to the advance of our age in cult- 
ure. Its future coincides with the future of civiliza- 
tion. Its final destruction would be synonymous with 
the victory of modern military barbarism in Europe.'' 

Along with this expression of fundamental 
sympathy with the aspirations of an oppressed 
nation there goes, however, a good deal of frank 
criticism of the weaknesses and defects of the 
Polish people. The author is by no means blind 
to their faults, and in those faults he sees clearly 
the historical explanation of the downfall of the 
ancient Kingdom, and the three partitions. Nor 
can he be hopeful for the future, for he sees that 
many of the old faults persist, and he marks also 
the deadly effectiveness of the brutal measures 
undertaken (especially in Russian Poland), and 
persistently pursued, with the object of destroy- 
ing the Polish national spirit and all that is most 
distinctive in Polish civilization. A people less 
intensely proud of its national inheritance, and 
less passionately patriotic in its endeavor to 
keep glowing the embers of Polish sentiment, 
would have succumbed long ago to the Russ- 
ianizing and Germanizing process. 

The indescribable meanness with which the 
Russian bureaucracy exercises its tyranny over 
its Polish subjects, the arbitrary and heartless 
character of its methods, is such as to put the 
Russian government outside the pale of ad- 
vanced civilization as it is understood in the 
rest of Europe and America. Dr. Brandes 
tells us things about the censorship, and ad- 
ministrative process, and the official crusade 
against the Polish language, and the perversion 
of justice, that we should think simply incred- 
ible were it not for the trustworthiness of the 
writer, and the unimpeachable evidence upon 
which the charges are sustained. What can 
anyone think, for example, anyone living in a 
civilized country, of a government which fines 
a tram car conductor for answering a Polish 
question in the same language, or which expels 
a boy of sixteen from school because he throws I 



a wreath to an actress who is persona non grata 
to the authorities? The latter incident occurred 
in a family which Dr. Brandes visited, and the 
boy felt his punishment so keenly that he went 
home and killed himself. This actress, by the 
way, was Madame Modrzejewska (to give her 
name its proper spelling), and the author pays 
a splendid tribute to her art. 

We are often told that adversity brings out 
the finer qualities of the individual and the 
race. The author finds in the Polish people a 
striking illustration of this principle, with 
whatever consolation it may afford. He speaks 
of the drastic foreign rule as having created 
" an intellectual condition which, however unhappy it 
may be, may in certain ways be called the finest and 
best possible to a nation, a condition which calls to 
mind that of primitive Christendom under the oppres- 
sion of Rome, a conception of the world, pessimistic in 
many points, but not on that account less true. Perhaps 
after all there is no condition more elevating for a race 
than one in which no distinguished man ever has any 
external distinction, title, or decoration, and where the 
official tinsel of honor is regarded as a disgrace, while on 
the other hand the official garb of disgrace, the political 
prison blouse, is regarded as honorable. . . . That 
which is the pith, the true pith of Christian teaching, 
a right estimate of the honors of this world, the igno- 
miny of this world, and the justice of this world, of real 
greatness and real baseness — this estimate, every one 
here, even the least gifted, has accepted. What a school 
for life! Poland is the only country, I believe, where 
primitive Christianity still exists as a power in society 
— and that equally for those who are Christians and 
for those who are not." 

These last words have special reference to the 
fact that the spirit of the Judenhetze, which has 
disgraced most of the surrounding countries, 
has been almost absent in Poland, especially in 
Russian Poland, " where common misfortune 
has united the Polish Jews to their Christian 
fellow-countrymen." This is strikingly illus- 
trated by the following incident : 

" When, in February, 1861, in the square before the 
castle, and in another larger square, shots were fired 
upon the kneeling crowd, who with the mouths of the 
Russian cannon before their eyes, gave utterance to a 
national hymn, and besought God to send to the Poles 
freedom and a Fatherland, the Jews felt impelled to 
manifest their national disposition by an unmistakable 
demonstration. In great numbers they accompanied 
their Rabbis into the Catholic churches, just as the 
Christians in great numbers went into the synagogues 
to sing the same hymn." 

Dr. Brandes thinks that, aside from the 
power of invention or production, the women 
of Poland are superior to the men. 

" The men in Poland are certainly not wanting in 
passion, in courage and in energy, in wit, in love of 
freedom, but it seems as if the women have more of 
these qualities. In Poland's great uprisings they have 
been known to enter into conspiracies, to do military

duty, and frequently euough of their own free will to 
accompany their loved ones to Siberia. . . . During the 
rebellion of 1830-31 there was not a battalion nor a 
squadron of the Polish army in which there were not 
female combatants, — after a battle or a march the 
soldiers always arranged a bivouac for the women, 
just as they took care that no word was spokeu whicb 
could offend their ears." 

The writer was evidently susceptible to the 
charm of Polish women, as many fragmentary 
observations attest. Speaking of the small feet 
of Polish ladies, he tells us how " it is said in 
Warsaw that in the Vienna shoe-shops they 
have a separate ease of boots and shoes for 
these feet, and that its contents are widely 
different from that of the case designed for 
Euglish ladies." His standards of feminine 
conduct seem to be a little strained, if the fol- 
lowing passage may be taken to illustrate it : 

" At the momeut when the room was thus described, 
I saw the most beautiful of the daughters of the house 
crossing it, and, as if quite justified in doing so, she 
kissed the lips of a young man who stood leaning 
against the mantelpiece, an incident whicb I note, 
partly because it is the only immoral action I witnessed 
during my stay here, partly because it proves that 
Polish women do not lose their presence of mind in 
alarming circumstances." 

It is a pity the distinguished guest should have 
witnessed so shocking a sight. Another per- 
sonal remark appeals to us by its naivete. 
** Here as everywhere on Polish ground one 
now and then meets a young woman so charm- 
ing, that one feels a kind of sadness at the 
thought of never seeing her again." True in- 
deed, but by other men, and elsewhere, the 
same feelings have been entertained. 

The author's account of the censorship, and 
of his ov^n difficulties in obtaining from it the 
permission to give his lectures on Polish liter- 
ature, is highly amusing. It took several weeks 
of red-tape negotiations to obtain the official 
authorization, and then the composition of the 
lectures themselves taxed the author's ingenuity 
to the utmost. 

" There were days when in spite of all my diligence 
I wrote almost nothing, days when I strove in vain to 
find expressions with double meanings, images, in them- 
selves indistinct, which could be understood by the au- 
dience, circumlocutions which could be seen through 
and yet would be unassailable. . . . Gradually I ac- 
quired practice in the rebus style, and wrote so that by 
an accent or a pause I could give a sentence a new and 
more living character. • I became expert in hints and 
implications." 

How this method worked out in practice is 
shown by an instructive anecdote. At a cer- 
tain point, the lecturer absolutely required to 
use a famous line from Mickiewicz, a line in 
-which the hero of the poem complains to God — 



" Thou art not the father of the world, but its — Txar ! " 

But to quote this line exactly, or even to use 
its idea in connection with its real context, was 
obviously out of the question. The author thus 
tells us how he got over the difficulty : 

" I chose, therefore, to speak of the different attri- 
butes of Polish authors as to the problem of cognition, 
and insinuated this in connection therewith. ■ And as 
the savages of antiquity, when they were angry with 
their gods, discharged an arrow into the vault of the 
heavens, so Conrad flings this taunt out into the uni- 
verse, which he says shall resound frum generation to 
generation : Thou God ! Thou art not the Father of the 
world, but its . . .' Here I made a pause of some sec- 
onds, during which a shudder literally ran through the 
closely packed hall. Then came the word tyrant, and 
they drew breath and looked at one another. No one 
moved a hand. After such passages a deathly silence 
prevails in order not to compromise the speaker. 
They vigorously applaud some innocent comparison as 
others a few minutes later, or they reserve the most 
hearty applause to the close, when no one can determine 
what it is which has specially called forth the storm of 
approval." 

By such devices as this, the lecturer hood- 
winked the censorship more than once, and 
introduced matters of the most explosive char- 
acter into his discourse. 

The lectures themselves, but in a form re- 
stored from the censor's mutilations, constitute 
the concluding section of the work before us. 
They give a history and philosophical analysis 
of nineteenth-century Polish literature more 
valuable than anything hitherto accessible in 
our language. The following passage, which 
appears in the discussion of the Byronic lean- 
ings of Mickiewicz and his fellow-poets, seems 
to us a remarkable example of speculative 
criticism : 

" Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that 
Shelley in his lifetime had received the recognition he 
only obtained half a century after his death ; then the 
Polish poets would have found in him the combination 
which nowhere met them — Gothe's lofty and sure con- 
ception of nature in combination with the practical en- 
thusiasm, the strong hope, and the belief in the miracles 
of activity, which they themselves required, and which 
to their sorrow they missed in the old man at Weimar; 
for Shelley was eternally young, and, like them, ap- 
pealed to the youth of the mind. If they had come 
under his influence instead of Byron's, the cause of in- 
tellectual freedom would have a less difficult battle to 
fight now. Without wouuding the religious feelings of 
their readers, they would have been able to transform 
them so far that the inevitable schism in the future 
between the ideas of this century and the emotional life 
of the nation would have been less deep." 

One more extract, and our citations must 
end. It is taken from the closing pages of the 
work, and is a word of reconciliation between 
the opposing factions of romanticism and real- 
ism.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



" As a form of art Romanticism is dead, a thing of 
the past. Its heroes and heroines, its spirits and witches, 
in part even its language and style, are antiquated. 
Nevertheless, there is a Romanticism which outlives 
forms of art and schools of art, and which still preserves 
its vitality and worth. It is the element of healthy en- 
thusiasm, which every strong human emotion can assume 
when it is refined and intensified beyond the average. 
Without any background whatever of superstition, our 
feelings for nature, for the woods and fields, the sea 
and the heavens, may assume this form of romantic 
ecstasy, and in even higher degrees emotions like love, 
friendship, love between parents and children, love of 
language and native land, and common memories may 
take a like form." 

Dr. Brandes says this because he sees that 
Polish literature is peculiarly rich in the ex- 
pression of this " abiding Romanticism." We 
have reproduced the passage because it seems 
to us one of the truest words ever spoken upon 
a vexed theme, and because it illustrates so 
clearly the insight and philosophical poise 
which place its author at the very head of liv- 
ing critics of literature.

A Thousand Years of the English 
Parliament.* 



In the Palace of Westminster there centre 
more things of interest, for those who are in- 
terested in history, politics, and the lives of 
great men, than in any other spot on the globe. 
In two large and lavishly illustrated volumes 
entitled " Parliament, Past and Present," the 
authors, accomplished book-makers as well as 
thorough students, have gathered a vast num- 
ber of pictures illustrating in one way or an- 
other the events of the thousand years of En- 
glish parlimentary life, and showing the build- 
ings in which that life has developed in great 
detail. In these volumes there are no less than 
six hundred and forty-three of these illustra- 
tions, including about twenty colored plates. 
There is no one of the five hundred and seventy- 
eight pages that has not at least one picture, 
many of them filling a large part of the page, 
and there are many full-page illustrations. 
The page is very large, nearly eight and a half 
by eleven inches. The paper is heavy, and the 
printing is excellent. These details are given, 
for they are necessary to show the real value 
of the book, which lies largely in the pictures

Picturesque Account of a Thousand Years in the Palace of

with which it is filled. These include portraits 
of those who have been at all prominent in 
parliamentary life, many views of the build- 
ings in and around the Palace Yard, some fa- 
mous pictures portraying stirring incidents in 
English history, many caricatures of notable 
men, and photographs illustrating the different 
sides of parliamentary life of this and earlier 
times. 

The work contains thirty- seven chapters. Of 
these, ten, covering a hundred and eighty pages, 
are entitled " Memories of St. Stephens," and 
give a running sketch of parliamentary history 
from the beginning, in the form of anecdotes 
of the leading actors in parliamentary life. As 
these anecdotes are largely taken from the stock 
found in every history, these chapters form the 
least valuable part of the work, though the 
portraits in connection with the anecdotes give 
them new life. The special value of the text 
of the work lies in the full descriptions of the 
old buildings and the present great structure, 
with the fine illustrations, showing masses and 
details, and in the inside view of parliamentary 
life and custom. As examples of the latter may 
be cited the chapters on " The Speaker as 
Host," " Parliamentary Costume," " Social As- 
pects of Parliamentary Life," " Wining and 
Dining," " The Lobby," " Ladies at the House"; 
and another group in the second volume on 
" The Parliament in Being," " The Speaker," 
" The House of Commons at Work," " Called 
to the Bar," "Parliamentary Privilege," "The 
House at Prayers," "In Committee." One 
chapter gives an account of Coronation Cere- 
monies at the Palace, from William the Con- 
queror to Edward the Seventh. One is tempted 
to quote the account of the coronation banquet 
of George IV. in Westminster Hall as an ex- 
ample of everything that should not be on such 
an occasion ; but lack of space forbids, and it 
is perhaps just as well not to show unnecessarily 
how near the savage instincts were to the surface 
even in court circles in the nineteenth century. 
And that was the last coronation banquet. 

An interesting chapter is that on Westmin- 
ster Hall, its history and traditions. One 
whose imagination was fired in boyhood by 
Macaulay's description of the scene in the great 
hall of William Rufus will be attracted to that 
chapter, and the next on "Memorable Trials." 
The illustrations of these chapters are of special 
interest. 

From another interesting chapter, that on 
"Ladies at the House," we give some extracts.

incident which occurred in the Parliament of 1428. On

of good account and well apparelled, went openly to 
the Upper House of Parliament and delivered letters 
to the Duke of Gloucester, to the Archbishops, and the 
other lords, because he would not deliver his wife 
Jaqueline of her grievous imprisonment (she being then 
detained as prisoner by the Duke of Burgundy), and 
suffering her there to remain unkindly whilst he kept 
another adultress, contrary to the law of God and the 
honorable estate of matrimony.' " 

These early advocates of women's rights, the 
first of a long line of fair reformers who have 
invaded the legislative precincts to redress the 
wrongs of their sex, seem to have created no 
small sensation, and from the fact that the 
Commons ventured to espouse the cause of 
Jaqueline, we may infer that their remonstrance 
had some effect. The course taken by the 
"Nether House" was cunningly to tack to a 
subsidy granted to the Duke of Gloucester a 
petition in favor of the Duchess. The quaint 
document we cannot give. 

Here is what one well-known lady had to say 
in a letter to a friend written in 1762 : 

" In the House of Commons everybody who can 
articulate is a speaker, to the great despatch of business 
and solidity of councils. They sit late every night, as 
every young gentleman who has a handsome person, a 
fine coat, a well-shaped leg, or a clear voice, is anxious 
to exhibit these advantages. To this kind of beau- 
oratory and tea-table talk the ladies, as is reasonable, 
resort very constantly. At first they attended in sueh 
numbers as to fill the the body of the House on great 
political occasions; but a ghost (the Cock Lane) started 
up in a dirty obscure alley in the City, and diverted the 
attention of the female politicians. From this it is 
pretty clear not merely that ladies had admission to the 
public galleries, but that they actually occupied seats by 
the side of members on the sacred floor of the House." 

The disgraceful scene that led to the abandon- 
ment of the system of uncontrolled freedom in 
favor of absolute exclusion, is described in a 
paragraph too long for quotation. 

■ Afterwards, so rigorous was the ban against the 
ladies, that Mrs. Sheridan was driven to the expedient 
of donning male attire in order to secure the opportu- 
nity of hearing her husband's eloquence. Wraxall also 
mentions in his « Memoirs ' having seen on one occasion 
the beautiful Duchess of Gordon in male attire in the 
Strangers' Gallery." 

Other scenes are described, showing the lack 
of restraint of women in the Houses of Parlia- 
ment. 

Some of the illustrations in the work are 
rather out of place, the colored plates are 
crude, the arrangement of the chapters is be- 
yond the writer's understanding, and many of 
the incidents related are commonplace ; yet 



the book is full of interest for the reader of 
history, and will serve to make real much that 
is read about some of the most interesting men 
and places in England.

Four Books on Art.* 



Four books on art, recently issued by dif- 
ferent publishers, have an unusual interest as 
representing four different points of view from 
which art may be regarded. One of the books 
is thoroughly technical, giving information as 
to the structure of a picture which is valuable 
both to the artist and to the critic. Another 
is theoretical, designed to prove a certain de- 
finite principle, and venturing into the realms 
of historical research. The third may perhaps 
be best described as philosophical, as it gives 
an estimate of the scope and value of nineteenth 
century art ; while the fourth, on " The Enjoy- 
ment of Art," is, as the title signifies, entirely 
simple and untechnical, a book for the layman, 
and designed to open the eyes of the unin- 
itiated to the beauty of a picture. A person 
in any way interested in art will be likely to 
find at least one of these volumes helpful. 

The merest lover of pictures, with no pre- 
tensions to knowledge, will delight in Mr. 
Carleton Noyes's volume on " The Enjoyment 
of Art." The work is in the form of answers 
to questions which a young collegian asked 
himself when he first entered the art galleries 
of Europe. "Why are these pictures?" he 
said. " What is the meaning of all this striv- 
ing after expression?" But only when he 
turned to himself, and asked what a picture 
meant to him, did he find his answer, which is 
the keynote to the book : " This work of art 
is the revelation to me of a fuller beauty, a 
deeper harmony, than I have ever seen or felt. 
The artist is he who has experienced this new 
wonder in nature, and who wants to communi- 
cate his joy, in concrete forms, to his fellow 
men." At the beginning of his work, the au- 
thor notes the fact that nearly everyone likes 
pictures ; he then proceeds to analyze the

cause of their enjoyment. What the mere 
primitive beholders desire in a picture, as he 
takes it, is clever imitation, or illusion. Others, 
and a larger class, make their demands upon the 
subject ; it must be something pleasing, and 
something which appeals to their experience. 
But to a third class the subject does not mat- 
ter so much as what the artist wanted to say 
about it. It is the additional beauty which an 
artist sees and which the ordinary man does 
not, that, successfully revealed to others, con- 
stitutes the highest enjoyment in art. This 
is the principal thought of the essay, which is 
charmingly written, the only fault being a re- 
petition of idea and of phrase which weakens 
the value of the message. It is, on the whole, a 
book likely to diffuse a wider knowledge of the 
true function of art. 

" Art in the Nineteenth Century " is the 
subject of a lecture delivered by Dr. Charles 
Waldstein, at Cambridge, in a series dealing 
with nineteenth century art, and now produced 
in book form. The work is a scholarly resume 
of the achievements of modern art, in which the 
author presents the conclusions of deep thought 
and of thorough study, without troubling the 
reader with tiresome detail. Art is treated in 
its broadest sense, as including " all forms of 
aesthetic enjoyment," of which painting is only 
one phase. One part of the subject after an- 
other, — literature, music, etc., — is taken up, 
and its progress in the last hundred years 
reviewed. The discussion is mainly with a view 
to proving one point, — namely, that the art- 
tendency of the nineteenth century is toward 
expansion. The subjects, the methods, the in- 
struments of all kinds of art have been en- 
larged, until now there is no phase of life that 
is not considered worthy of the artist, and there 
are few means that he will scorn to use to ob- 
tain his effect. Although the danger of fitting 
facts to one idea is obvious, this principle is 
one that can hardly be denied ; and, as the 
author proves, the past century is as remarkable 
for its artistic achievement as it is for its ad- 
vance in science. 

An art work of a very different kind from 
those just discussed is Mr. T. A. Cook's treatise 
on " Spirals in Nature and Art." The book be- 
gins with a description of a beautiful staircase 
at Blois in Touraine, the architect of which 
has hitherto been unknown ; and a likeness is 
pointed out between this staircase, which is 
illustrated, and a certain sea-shell, scientifically 
known as Voluta Vespertilio. The formation in 
the two cases is exactly similar, and the reader 



willingly follows the author through his explor- 
ations, which end in exploiting Leonardo da 
Vinci as the designer of the stairway. Leon- 
ardo lived in the period in which the staircase 
referred to is supposed to have been built, and 
was the only architect of the time who was 
likely to have studied shells. A minute exami- 
nation of manuscripts and drawings left by the 
great artist confirms the impression in a hundred 
ways ; for instance, Leonardo was left-handed, 
and the spiral of the stair goes round from left 
to right, the opposite of the natural direction. 
The argument is close, exact, and convincing; 
and it leaves small room for doubt that the 
creator of the lovely spiral at Blois has been 
discovered. A study of other spirals in art, 
which are based upon natural formations, is 
included, making the book an extremely inter- 
esting and suggestive one. 

Mr. Henry R. Poore's comprehensive study 
of " Pictorial Composition and the Critical 
Judgment of Pictures " is said, in the preface, 
to have been written for students of painting, 
amateur photographers, and professional art- 
ists ; but no one who desires to judge pictures 
intelligently can afford to pass it by. The work 
is in no way popular, — composition in pictures 
is hardly a popular subject; but the style is 
so direct and the treatment so intelligent that 
the main points cannot fail to become clear to 
the careful reader. Plentiful reproductions of 
masterpieces illustrate each step in the expo- 
sition. After dealing with main principles, the 
writer takes up "The ^Esthetics of Composi- 
tion," " Suggestiveness," "Mystery," etc.; and 
finally leads to the still more interesting theme 
of the judgment of pictures. If every critic 
could be made to read this last chapter alone, 
how much flippant and misunderstanding com- 
ment on art we might be spared ! A strong plea 
for a wider knowledge of art principles is found 
in the fifteenth chapter. " Is it unreasonable," 
writes Mr. Poore, " to ask the many sharers in 
the passing picture pleasures of a great city to 
make themselves intelligent in some other and 
more practical way than by contact, gleaning 
only through a lifetime what should have been 
theirs without delay as a foundation; and to 
exchange for the vague impression of pleasure 
defended in the simple comfort of knowing 
what one likes, the enjoyment of sure authority, 
and a reason for it ? The time is past when 
the intelligent reader is frightened by the word 
technical; and many besides the class he writes 
for will welcome Mr. Poore's well- classified 
principles of art criticism. Alice Brown.

Briefs on Xje\v Books. 



tu late* history For several years it has been known 
of American that Professor W. P. Trent was en- 

luerature. gaged in preparing for Mr. Gosse's 

series of " The Literatures of the World " ( Appleton ) 
a volume on " American Literature." The work 
has at last appeared, and does the highest credit to 
the taste and scholarship of its author. It seems 
to us, on the whole, to be the best of the three ex- 
tensive treatments that our literature has thus far 
received, although we are by no means insensible 
of the admirable qualities of the works written by 
Professor C. F. Richardson and Professor Barrett 
Wendell. It is a book that bears upon every page 
the mark of patient first-hand investigation. It is 
evident that the author has read the books about 
which he writes, and that even when he does no 
more than set down in a biief paragraph the con- 
ventional estimate of an author, he has arrived at 
this conclusion by a process of independent judg- 
ment. His criticism, in its relation to its predeces- 
sors, seems to have for an aim the reduction of all 
overwrought or exaggerated views to a common 
basis of sober objective appraisal. If a writer has 
been overvalued in the past, Mr. Trent is careful 
to show in what respects the excessive estimate 
needs qualification ; if a writer has not received his 
due, on the other hand, there is a reasoned attempt 
to correct the past injustice. This determination 
to be absolutely fair, to view a writer in every 
possible light, is a marked characteristic of Mr. 
Trent's woik. It frequently involves a nice balanc- 
ing of conflicting opinions, and in the process of 
leveling up or down, as the case may be, so many 
qualifications are admitted that we do not get the 
sharp portraiture given us by other critics, and 
there are moments when we almost wish that the 
author would indulge in a little dogmatism at the 
expense of caution. One important feature of the 
book results from the fact that Mr. Trent's scholar- 
ship in American history is almost on a par with 
his knowledge of our literature. He is thus enabled 
at every point to bring the book into its proper rela- 
tions with the period which produced it, and in this 
respect his treatment of the subject has a marked 
superiority over the best that we have had hereto- 
fore. Compared with the other volumes of the series 
to which it belongs, the present work is upon a 
much larger scale than any of its associated dis- 
cussions. It has nearly fifty per cent more matter 
than any of the others, although it deals with a 
literature which can boast of only one century of 
serious creative activity, and although it makes no 
attempt to deal with the last third of that century, 
but closes with the period of the Civil War. The 
volume is simply packed with names, titles, and 
historical facts, but all so deftly combined in run- 
ning text that every page proves readable. The 
frank and engaging style of the author is pieced 
out, though sparingly, with apt quotations and illus- 



trations, and the author's wide literary allusiveness 
adds not a little to his charm. Nothing could well 
be happier, for example, than to call the "Magnalia 
Christi " " a colossal boulder left behind by the re- 
treating glacier of Calvinism"; nothing could be 
more just than to say of •' The Federalist " that 
" no praise can be too high that does not, like some 
American praise for it, lift it into comparison with 
compositions not in its class." 

The fertile valleys of Egypt and 
SjS^T 1 ' Babylonia have produced many 

kinds of historical fruit during the 
last half-century. Out of their tumuli, tombs, and 
terraces, we have extracted centuries of history, 
scores of magical formulae, and volumes of religious 
beliefs. Professor Sayce of Oxford has been a 
pioneer in this work. In 1887 he delivered the 
Hibbert lectures, on the religion of Babylonia. He 
has just now published the Gilford Lectures, de- 
livered in Aberdeen, Scotland, on " The Ancient 
Egyptian and Babylonian Conception of the Divine" 
(Scribner). Fifteen years have wrought wonders 
in our conception of ancient civilization and beliefs. 
This volume is a long step in advance of that of 
1887. Here we find Professor Sayce at his best. 
Always a pioneer in archaeological research, he 
happily combines clearness of statement with 
breadth and depth of scholarship. This volume 
strikes out more positively than any other into some 
new lines of thought. The religions of both Egypt 
and Babylonia are composites. That of Egypt is 
a fusion of the beliefs of the Semitic conquerors of 
Egypt and the non- Semitic or possibly Libyan ab- 
origines. The Babylonian religion is a fusion of 
the primitive Sumerian beliefs and those of the 
conquering Semitic peoples. Professor Sayce main- 
tains the identity of the conquering Semitic popula- 
tion of Babylonia and the dynastic Egyptians — both 
Semites with common customs and beliefs. He 
goes farther, and attempts to separate the elements 
contributed by each of these elemental peoples. 
This is a hazardous task, in view of the fragmentary 
character of the material already discovered and 
available. Professor Sayce's discussion of the prim- 
itive animism and of the later pantheons of those 
ancient peoples is replete with carefully gleaned 
facts. The entire volume is both attractive in style 
and full of interesting and instructive material. 
This is the best work, from several points of view, 
that Professor Sayce has ever written. 

" An Introductory Study of Ethics " 
22££ELa (Longmans), by Mr. Warner Fite, is 

a college text-book characterized by 
clearness of statement, careful analysis of the lead- 
ing types of ethical theory, and a strong practical 
bent. Mr. Fite protests against the assumption of 
certain writers that the ethical problem is one of 
no practical importance. Granted that opinion is 
practically unanimous in declaring certain element- 
ary lines of conduct to be right, and certain others

wrong, it is nevertheless true that the very terms in 
which we state these principles are far from being 
exactly defined, and thus "this practical unanimity 
is largely illusory." Moreover, the ethical field 
abounds in problems that are too complicated to be 
referred with confidence to any one principle, and 
thereby definitely solved. The author passes in 
review, and subjects to close analysis, first the 
various forms of utilitarian or hedonistic ethics, 
then the opposed forms of the system to which 
the general designation of idealism may be given. 
His own leanings are clearly toward the ethics 
of idealism, but he also recognizes the value of 
hedonism as a basis of right conduct, and in the 
end seeks a middle course, the establishment of a 
modus vivendi between the two schools, or perhaps 
the reconciliation of the opposing themes in a 
broader synthesis than has yet been achieved. He 
offers a novelty in his attempt to show that the 
hedonist must accept the Lamarckian view of 
biological evolution, while the idealist is bound to 
be a partisan of the doctrine of Herr Weissmann. 
But we are unable to see that he makes his point. 
And his argument does not shake us in the opinion 
that it is perfectly possible to believe at the same 
time in the ethics of principle or of purpose and in 
the transmission of acquired characteristics. Mr. 
Fite's references throughout the work are almost 
exclusively to English thinkers, and thus his book 
has too narrow a range. The Kantian view, in- 
deed, is discussed at length, but no other Germans 
are mentioned, save for an occasional allusion to 
Paulsen and Wundt. We recommend to the au- 
thor particularly a careful study of Schopenhauer, 
whose ethical theory cannot possibly be ignored. 
And among English writers, the author would have 
been especially well-advised had he taken into ac- 
count Mr. Morley's essay " On Compromise," which 
bears directly upon the very questions of practical 
conduct always to the fore in the present volume. 

A study of The fourth volume in the " Popular 

the French Library of Art" (Dutton) is an 

impresrionisu. attractive little book on the Freneh 
Impressionists, by M. Camille Mauclair. He has 
attempted, he tells us, " to sum up the ideas, per- 
sonalities, and works of a group of artists who have 
remained but little known and who have been 
greatly misjudged." The book is especially ad- 
dressed to the "British Public"; perhaps the au- 
thor considers such an appreciation less needed in 
America. His presentation is clear and sympa- 
thetic, avoiding alike the over- technical and the 
merely popular discussion of the subject. He takes 
the ground that no art manifestation is really isolated, 
and that the Impressionists were the legitimate de- 
scendents of Ruysdael, Lorraine, and Poussin. The 
author finds also in this school much that is related 
to the work of the Preraphaelites, though he regards 
the latter as bound together " by intellectual prin- 
ciples; the Impressionists, by temperament, friend- 
ship, and unjust derision." Of particular interest 



is the chapter on the theories of this group of paint- 
ers, which M. Mauclair sums up as follows: "Study 
of atmosphere, dissociation of tones, study of char- 
acter rather than classic beauty, subordination of 
subject to interest of execution, movement toward 
' symphonisation ' of colors." This discussion of the 
theory of Impressionism is followed by a study in 
detail of the work of its greatest exponents, Edouard 
Manet, Degas, Claude Monet, and Renoir; while 
the lesser painters of the school, and neo-impres- 
sionism, receive due attention. The many good en- 
gravings well illustrate this subject. These were 
made from photographs in the private gallery of 
M. Durand-Ruel, to whom the author makes due 
acknowledgment. The translation, by Mr. P. 6. 
Eonody, is in general carefully done, though show- 
ing a fondness for rare words and at times rendering 
the French idiom too literally. In example, " since 
a long time" and "he revolted the prejudiced." 
But in spite of these and similar blemishes, the ren- 
dering is accurate and merits commendation. 

One of the most interesting phases 
Irlmce'ndwtaium. of American literature is discussed 

and illustrated in Mr. George Willis 
Cooke's anthology of " The Poets of Transcenden- 
talism " (Houghton). Few people realize how much 
poetry (of a kind) the movement produced, and it 
is only by ransacking " The Dial " and other peri- 
odicals of the time that an adequate showing of 
transcendental poetry can be made. This work of 
investigation Mr. Cooke has performed, with the 
result that he has brought together in his interest- 
ing volume not only the well-known pieces of Emer- 
son, Lowell, and a few others, but also a host of 
pieces deserving to be known, but not heretofore 
reprinted from the sources of their original publica- 
tion. No less than forty-two authors are repre- 
sented, a few of whom, however, hardly seem to us 
to have been sufficiently identified with the transcen- 
dental movement to warrant their inclusion. We can- 
not quite see, for example, what Helen Hunt Jackson 
and Edward Rowland Sill are doing in this galley. 
It is only by a broad definition, which shall itself 
transcend geographical and social limitations, that 
these forty-two poets may be brought into the same 
category. Such a definition Mr. Cooke has evi- 
dently adopted, and, indeed, he embodies it in his 
introduction when he calls transcendentalism " de- 
mocracy in contact with Puritanism," and proceeds 
to indicate its connotations as inquiry, revolt, indi- 
viduality, inwardness, and optimism. We are glad 
to have this book, and glad to have the poems which 
it rescues for us from so many scattered quarters.

science of preventive medicine is unknown. The 
position which Great Britain holds as the foremost 
nation in colonization has given her exceptional re- 
sponsibilities and opportunities for dealing with the 
international problems of disease. It is therefore 
fitting that one volume of the Cambridge Geograph- 
ical Series (Macmillan) should be devoted to " The 
Geography of Disease." The author, Dr. Clemon, 
is a member of the Ottoman Board of Health, and 
has had unusual opportunities for observation in 
Russia and the Orient. The volume treats general 
medical and surgical diseases, those of the skin, and 
those caused by animal parasites, giving the history 
of each, with its recent geographical distribution, 
and discussing its relation to climatic factors — 
such as latitude, temperature, altitude, and humidity 
— to social conditions, to race, and to sex. The 
agencies and methods of distribution are set forth 
wherever known, or discussed with candor when 
judgment must still be suspended till research shall 
decide among conflicting opinions. Instructive maps 
and charts show the known distribution of the more 
important diseases. The author's perspective is 
such that the Orient, Russia, Africa, and British 
colonies everywhere, enter largely into his treat- 
ment ; while the United States and the Philippines 
are only casually mentioned, and some of their lead- 
ing authorities are overlooked. This, and the ab- 
sence of an index, are, however, only minor defects 
in an excellent treatise. 



"A History of French Versification," 
fnVJr^i^ian. h J Mr - L - E - Kastner, is published 

by Mr. Henry Frowde for the Oxford 
University Press. At the same time we have from 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., in their series of " En- 
glish Readings," a work on " English Verse " by 
Dr. Raymond Macdonald Alden. Both these works 
undertake, in their respective fields, to do much the 
same thing. They survey the whole history of verse 
in French and English, discuss the chief technical 
questions of metrical theory, classify the many 
poetic forms, and are at every point illustrated by 
a bewildering array of carefully-chosen examples. 
These examples are in themselves so interesting, 
that in reading the books we have been constantly 
tempted to ignore their real purpose for the sake 
of the simple enjoyment they afford as anthologies 
of two great poetic literatures. Every reader will 
miss some of his own favorite illustrations, no doubt 
(in the case of the French book the absence of 
Baudelaire is inexplicable), but will probably find 
compensation in many unfamiliar citations of great 
interest. Both books give us forms from the ear- 
liest literature as well as from the latest, and Dr. 
Alden often finds it necessary to offset his English 
examples by their French prototypes. Both books 
are productions of wide and accurate scholarship, 
and are deserving of very high praise. Both au- 
thors lean heavily upon the Germans, Mr. Kastner 
uponTobler's "Versbau," Dr. Alden upon Schipper's 
" Englische Metrik." 



The Appleton series of " Historic 

William Johnson, the colonial In- 
dian commissioner for America, by Mr. Augustus C. 
Buell. The well-balanced biography begins with the 
arrival of Johnson, at twenty-two years of age, to 
take control of a large tract of land lying in the 
Mohawk Valley belonging to his uncle, Sir Peter 
Warren. Coming into contact with the Indians at 
this advanced point on the border, he early inaugu- 
rated a policy of just dealing with the savages wjrich 
won them to him by contrast with the tricks used 
by the ordinary trader of the Valley. " He found 
time," says the sketch here presented, "to learn 
to a degree never surpassed, and seldom if ever 
equalled by any white man, the character, ways, 
manner, modes of thinking, and the language of the 
Iroquois Indians." As proof of this, it is stated that 
he never made use of an interpreter even in the 
important proceedings of an Indian conference. 
Johnson's numerous Indian wives and half-breed 
children, for which the agent is usually condemned, 
are here excused because the departure from social 
custom may have been done to bring him influence 
and esteem from his savage brethren. Incidentally, 
the volume treats of the struggle between the 
French and British for the Mississippi Valley, the 
contact of the white men with the savages, and the 
various wars in which the Indians were engaged 
prior to the American Revolution. 

Arnold's march The courage of Benedict Arnold, 
/rom Cambridge plunging with his Canadian expe- 
to Quebec. dition into the wilderness between 

the Maine coast and Quebec, has frequently been 
praised, the endurance of his men eulogized, and 
the purpose and failure of the unfortunate attempt 
commented on. The exact route Arnold took 
through the wilderness has never been fully deter- 
mined. It therefore remained for Professor Justin 
H. Smyth to investigate the matter thoroughly, and 
then to write his account of " Arnold's March from 
Cambridge to Quebec" (Putnam). The materials 
for the investigation are found in old maps and in 
diaries kept on the expedition. Arnold's is the chief 
of these, " the one extant journal that has never 
been printed in full till now." It is from the 
Sparks copy in the Harvard library. The book is 
confined closely to the subject, omitting all details 
foreign to the purpose of ascertaining the exact 
route traversed, and closing abruptly with the ar- 
rival of the expedition on the north shore of the 
St. Lawrence near Quebec. An exhaustive set of 
explanatory notes includes Arnold's diary men- 
tioned above.

frontispiece from a mosaic discovered in Africa only a 
few years ago.

and initials, a consistent and distinctive decorative treat- 
ment has been followed, and the illustrations (made by 
Miss Charlotte Weber, a young New York artist) are 
of striking originality. 

Mr. Charles Josselyn, author of " The True Napo- 
leon," has in press for early publication by Messrs. 
Paul Elder & Co., a collection of interesting and in- 
structive selections from famous authors, entitled " My 
Favorite Book Shelf." Unlike the usual book of quota- 
tions, this volume includes passages of readable length 
so chosen and arranged in many cases as to epitomize 
the messages of the voluminous originals. 

"London in the Time of the Stuarts" is the title of 
the new book by the late Sir Walter Besant, which the 
Macmillan Co. will publish in the autumn. Sir Walter 
undertook an important work in several volumes which 
were to be called collectively " The Survey of London." 
The first volume in the series, " London in the Eigh- 
teenth Century," appeared last winter, and it is ex- 
pected that the third volume will be published next 
year. 

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. have undertaken the 
American publication of a new series of English re- 
prints of old-time favorites. " Doctor Syntax " and 
" Mytton's Memoirs " are the two volumes first pub- 
lished, and they are made very attractive by the re- 
production of all the original illustrations, which in both 
these cases are colored. Blake's Illustrations of Job, 
Ainsworth's " Windsor Castle," and Bewick's fables, 
are among the issues soon to follow. 

With the September issue " The Printing Art " en- 
ters upon its second volume, having achieved during 
the half-year of its existence a success not often scored 
by any new periodical. The appeal of this magazine is 



not alone to the practical printer; its interest is no less 
vital to book lovers and those who are but indirectly 
concerned with the making of books. By the sound- 
ness of its teachings and the example of its mechanical 
beauty, " The Printing Art " bids fair to do more to 
raise the standards of American typographic taste than 
any other force now at work. 

Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., who are now bringing 
out the " National " edition of Daniel Webster's works 
in eighteen volumes, to be sold only by subscription, 
will publish in the Fall a book of Webster's best speeches 
entitled " Daniel Webster for Young Americans." This 
book will contain, in addition to the important speeches 
by the great statesman, an introduction and notes by 
Prof. Chas. F. Richardson of Dartmouth College and 
an essay on Webster as a master of English style by 
Edwin P. Whipple. 

Better things than usually emanate from American 
" private presses " may confidently be expected of the 
" Village Press," lately established at Park Ridge, 
Illinois, by Messrs. F. W. Goudy and W. H. Ransom. 
Both proprietors have had practical experience in the 
printing craft, and Mr. Goudy is in addition a decora- 
tive artist of ability and reputation. The first pro- 
duction of the press will be a reprint of the essay on 
" Printing " by William Morris and Emery Walker, 
from the volume of " Arts and Crafts Essays." 

The next work in the series of notable Americana in- 
augurated by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. last Fall with 
a reprint of the Lewis and Clark Journals, will be an 
edition of Father Louis Hennepin's " A New Discovery," 
based on the second issue of 1698, and edited by Mr. 
Reuben Gold Thwaites. Besides the regular library 
edition in two octavo volumes, there will be a limited 
edition on hand- made paper which from a typographical 
point of view will probably form the most attractive 
historical reprint yet put forth by an American pub- 
lisher. 

Mr. Henry Frowde has just acquired a series of 
drawings on wood made by George Cruikshank nearly 
fifty years ago to illustrate " The Pilgrim's Progress." 
These drawings have never yet been published, and 
they will form the chief feature of an edition de luxe of 
Bunyan's masterpiece which will be issued from the 
Oxford University Press in the autumn. Some of the 
drawings were cut on wood under the artist's own di- 
rection, and the others have now been similarly pre- 
pared, and each is to be printed as a separate plate on 
Japanese paper. For upwards of thirty years these 
drawings have been in the possession of a well-known 
collector, who was a friend of Cruikshank, and they 
are thoroughly characteristic of the artist's genius. 

Some interesting additions will be made during 
the coming Fall and Winter to the limited " Riverside 
Press editions " published under the imprint of Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. The volumes so far an- 
nounced comprise a work by Mrs. Elizabeth Robins 
Penuell entitled "My Cookery Books," illustrated with 
numerous reproductions of old engravings and titles ; 
" The History of Oliver and Arthur," a mediaeval Latin 
romance translated into English by William Leighton 
and Eliza Barrett, illustrated with fifty engravings re- 
drawn from the old wood-cuts that appeared in the 
original ; " Fifteen Sonnets of Petrarch," selected and 
translated by Mr. Thomas Wentworth Higginson ; and 
the third and concluding volume of the sumptuous folio 
reprint of Montaigne's Essays.

Announcements of Fall Books. 



The Dial's list of the books announced for publica- 
tion this Fall, presented herewith, is as usual the earli- 
est comprehensive and classified information given to 
the public regarding the important forthcoming books 
of the present season. Entry is here made of more 
than twelve hundred titles, representing the season's 
output of over fifty leading American publishers. The 
list has been prepared entirely from advance informa- 
tion secured especially for this purpose. All the books 
entered are presumably new books — new editions not 
being included unless having new form or matter; and, 
with a few necessary exceptions, the list does not in- 
clude Fall books already issued and entered in our reg- 
ular List of New Books. While no attempt has been 
made to include titles as titles merely, regardless of 
their significance or interest to our readers, yet it is 
believed that no really important title is missing from 
this list. One important exception must be noted, — 
the books to be issued by the Macmillan Co., whose 
list, always of much interest, unfortunately reached us 
too late for insertion here. The announcements of this 
firm will, however, be given in our next issue. Some 
of the more interesting features of the present list are 
commented on in the leading editorial in this issue of 
The Dial.

only a high intellectual development under most favor- 
able conditions, bat includes a unique and practical 
training in the application of the various branches of

velop a sound body and to Jit the student Jor the womanly 
duties of life.

AS A WORKING TOOL 

For the student and the writer, aa an authoritative reference hook for schools, families, and business men, there is one book 
which offers superior advantages both in the solid value of its information, and the ease with which it is obtained. 

One's admiration for Webster's International Dictionary increases daily as it comes to be better known. It never refuses 
the information sought and it never overwhelms one with a mass of misinformation illogically arranged. 

THE ST. JAMES GAZETTE of London, England, says : For the teacher, the pupil, the student, and the litterateur, there is nothing 
better ; it covers everything. 

The New and Enlarged Edition recently issued has 25,000 new words and phrases, 2364 pages and 5000 illustrations. 

Our name is on the title-pages of all the authentic dictionaries of the Webster series.

A REMARKABLE POEM 

"As It Was in the Beginning" 

By JOAQUIN MILLER 



A short time ago it was reported that Mr. 
Miller was dead, but the appearance of this 
poem — his last and greatest — is evidence that 
the "Poet of the Sierras" is very much alive. 
The work was inspired by President Roosevelt's 
remarks on race suicide. It is an impassioned plea 
for pure and unselfish domestic love. There is 
a couplet in the book that is applicable to every 
reader of it : 

Look you for evil? Look jor ill 

Or good, you find just <what you nuill. 

"A new long poem by Joaquin Miller is a literary 
event." — San Francisco Chronicle. 

"As a descriptive poem this deserves to be classed 
among the best in the language." — Sacramento Bee. 

"A strong and virile poem." — The Argonaut.

Lessons in Physics 

By LOTHROP D. HIGGINS, Instructor in 
Physics, Morgan School, Clinton, Conn. List 
price, 90 cents. 
"Lessons in Physics " provides a thorough course in phy- 
sics for schools which offer little or no laboratory work. 
Principles are explained by references to common or fa- 
miliar phenomena rather than to set laboratory experi- 
ments. In fact, throughout the work the central aim has 
been to give the student an intimate knowledge of the 
physical manifestations that are most commonly met in 
our daily experience. The author has taken great pains 
to secure simplicity and clearness of expression and facts 
are explained so that the pupil is led to think them 
througfh and thus to fix them in mind. 



A Latin Grammar For ^ l °4e S and 

By WILLIAM GARDNER HALE, Professor of 
Latin, and CARL DARLING BUCK, Professor 
of Comparative Philology in the University of 
Chicago. List price, $1.00. 

A working text-book adapted to the needs of high- 
school and college students, and at the same time 
presenting the facts of the Latin language in 
their true relations to one another. 
In subject-matter, in arrangement, and even in its 
convenient and attractive mechanical form, this 
grammar stands out as a superior book which will 
repay the careful scrutiny of all teachers of Latin. 



The JoneS Readers A New Basal Series in Five Books 

By L H. JONES, Principal of Michigan State Normal School, Tpsilanti. 
Unrivaled in the amount and quality of reading material. Practical because of their careful grad- 
ing and their explanatory and biographical not 
Unique because of the wide experience and authoritative rank of the author.

about it. You will praise it and condemn it. You will 
preach about it and bemoan it; admire it and despise it; 
give it away because you are glad to be rid of it — and 
purchase other copies to give away again. And after it 
all you will decide that it is a great book." — Philadel-

OUR CRITICAL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 



Since the literature produced in this country 
is only a part, and a small part at that, of the 
whole body of English literature, it is inevi- 
table that its relations to the literature of the 
mother-country should be constantly before the 
mind of its historian. But although always 
present in the consciousness, it does not seem 
either necessary or desirable that these rela- 
tions should be all the time pressed forward in 
the discussion ; it would be better to acknowl- 
edge them frankly once for all, and then leave 
them to be taken as implicit in the history, 
bringing them into prominence only when some 
case of real analogy or contrast arises. Instead 
of seeking for points of contact which are not 
obvious, and of forcing comparisons for their 
own sake, we would do well to drink out of our 
own glass, and be content for the time being 
with our refreshment. The centuries of En- 
glish literature from Caedmon to Tennyson are 
there in the background, no doubt, but we do 
not need to invoke them all the time for the ex- 
planation or the criticism of every production 
that happens for the moment to occupy the 
foreground of our attention. 

American critics have now been writing 
about American literature for something like 
a hundred years, and their work has been 
characterized, as a rule, by an exaggerated 
consciousness of the existence of the parent 
literature on the other side of the ocean. It 
is true, of course, that no literary phenomenon 
may be adequately discussed without taking 
account of all its bearings, historical and ideal, 
but this is a very different matter from the habit 
of thought with which we are now concerned. 
That habit has for its distinctive feature a sort 
of intellectual uneasiness, born of the fear that 
somehow, unless we dot all our i's and cross 
all our t's, we may be cheated out of something 
that is our due. Now there is an uneasiness 
of servility, and another of boastfulness, and 
another betokened by the apologetic attitude, 
and yet another bound up with a chastened but 
still vigorous self-esteem. And our national at- 
titude toward our own literature, as evidenced 
by the writings of our critics and historians, has 
been marked successively by these four types 



208 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



of the uneasy feeling that we are not appre- 
ciated quite in accordance with our deserts. 

Let us take them one at a time, and explain 
just what we mean. During the first decades 
of the nineteenth century the attitude of our 
writers toward their English brethren was one 
of self-abasement. English models were every- 
where set up for imitation and English praise 
was the only praise worth having. This is the 
attitude satirized by Lowell when he wrote : 
" In private we're always embracing the knees 
Of some two-penny editor over the seas, 
And licking his critical shoes, for you know 'tis 
The whole aim of our lives to get one English notice; 
My American puffs I would willingly burn all 
(They 're all from one source, monthly, weekly, diurnal) 
To get but a kick from a transmarine journal." 

This craving for notice on any terms clearly 
shows the uneasiness of one who fears lest his 
light be hidden under a bushel, of one who is 
willing to endure "the spurns that patient 
merit of the unworthy takes " rather than not 
receive any attention at all. 

That the boaster is a person uneasy in his 
mind is proverbial, and boastfulness has been 
one of our national vices for over a century, 
marking more clearly than anything else our 
persistence in provincialism. Even Lowell, in 
his earlier period, blew the American trumpet 
too blaringly to be in the best of taste, and 
the spirit which, two hundred years before, had 
styled Mistress Anne Bradstreet " the tenth 
muse, lately sprung up in America," was dis- 
played unabashed by many of the earlier of 
Lowell's contemporaries. Every goose was a 
swan in those days, and our periodical press 
bestowed resounding praise upon all kinds of 
ephemeral scribblers. It was the special delight 
of Poe, who happened to be about during the 
thirties and forties, to prick these bubble rep- 
utations, and this negative activity is no small 
part of his service to our criticism. It put an 
end to vaunting of the cruder sort, at least, 
and prepared the way for something like na- 
tional judgment of books and their writers. 

The third phase of sensitive uneasiness about 
our literary status has for its note Touchstone's 
description of Audrey : "A poor thing, but 
mine own." It is represented by those critics 
who freely admit that Cooper was not a Scott, 
that Irving was not a Lamb, and that Long- 
fellow was not a Tennyson, but who at the 
same time insist that these men and their com- 
peers, being of our own flesh and blood, and 
embodying the traits of our own national char- 
acter, are for us even more significant than 
their greater English contemporaries. These 



apologists exalt the importance of the relative 
at the expense of the absolute in judgment, 
and thus seek to restore the national self-re- 
spect by a logical quibble. There is a certain 
validity in this argument, for we naturally 
love the men whose writings make so intimate 
an appeal to our sympathies, and there is no 
cause for shame in the confession of our affec- 
tion. But it is possible to make overmuch of 
the matter ; its very obviousness to our own 
consciousness makes unnecessary any very lav- 
ish use of words to set it forth, and our over- 
insistence upon it betokens a trifle too much 
of anxiety to force our English brethren into 
our own way of thinking about American lit- 
erature. It was Heine who once wickedly re- 
marked that a woman writer always has one 
eye on her subject and the other on some man, 
and we fancy that it is with one eye to the 
Britisher that many an American critic of this 
apologetic type has thus praised the work of 
his fellow-countrymen. 

The fourth and last phase of our uneasy 
self- consciousness concerning the national lit- 
erature comes very near to bridging over the 
gap between the provincial and the cosmopol- 
itan outlook, and marking the transition from 
the relative view to the absolute. It takes 
the form of some such expression of opinion 
as the following : "In our desire to be just we 
have perhaps overshot the mark and made 
greater concessions than were necessary ; com- 
ing to look at it candidly, and with a full re- 
cognition of the legitimate demands of literary 
art, this work is not so bad after all, and there 
is no reason why we should apologize for it." 
Now the attitude thus summarized is one suf- 
ficiently justified by the evident achievements 
of American literature, and no fault is to be 
found with it as an attitude. It represents 
the point of view of the self-respecting critic, 
neither unduly subservient to alien standards 
and influences, nor asserting an unwarranted 
prerogative of independent judgment. But it 
is possible to force the note overmuch, to make 
too explicit what had better have been left im- 
plicit, and thus to betray in a subtle form the 
very uneasiness, the very self -consciousness 
which has with so much effort been so nearly 
eliminated from our appraisement of our own 
literature. 

In the last and best of the critical discus- 
sions to which American literature has been 
subjected there are frequent illustrations of the 
attitude which we have just characterized, and 
they prompt us by so much to take exception

to a critical performance which is in most re- 
spects entitled to unqualified praise. We are 
told of Franklin that he was M the most com- 
plete representative of his century that any 
nation can point to, . . . yet ... he was the 
product of colonial dependencies on which the 
old world looked down.' ; The essays of Mar- 
garet Fuller " are much more deserving of 
praise and perusal than the latter-day public 
seems to think." Irving's qualities " fully war- 
rant his admirers in continuing to enjoy the 
four or five volumes in which his best work is 
contained, and in joining his name without 
apology to those of Goldsmith and Lamb." 
Since such essays as those of Curtis ** are not 
abundant in American literature, there is no 
reason for the readers of to-day to be super- 
cilious with regard to them." In these and 
many similar passages the author seems to us 
to protest too much, to touch a note that were 
better left unsounded. This guarded way of 
calling attention to our own merits is as far as 
possible removed from the blustering self-as- 
sertion and the mutual-admiration methods that 
aroused Poe's ire in the earlier days of our let- 
ters, but we cannot quite reconcile it with the 
highest ideal of critical conduct. 

That ideal will no doubt long remain a coun- 
sel of perfection for the American critic deal- 
ing with the literature of his own people. It 
is wellnigh impossible that it should be other- 
wise, for as long as criticism is a matter of 
judgment — and it can never escape being that 
— it must invoke comparisons and resort to 
illustrative parallels. Particularly must this 
be the case with criticism of a literature which 
is only the offshoot and collateral development 
of another and far more important literature. 
And the treatment thus forced upon it by 
circumstances will inevitably lead to such bal- 
ancings as Emerson against Carlyle, Whittier 
against Burns, and Bryant against Words- 
worth. Xor will it be surprising if, whenever 
the inclination of the balance appears uncer- 
tain, the critic's word shall be cast into the 
scale in such wise as to give his compatriot the 
benefit of the doubt. However fully we may 
take to heart the injunction of the American 
declaration of intellectual independence, as 
voiced in Emerson's " American Scholar," to 
walk on our own feet, to work with our own 
hands, and to speak our own minds, we shall 
be likely for long years to come to keep on 
reminding each other and the rest of mankind 
that we are walking, and working, and speak- 
ing to some purpose. 



SHAKESPEARE'S HEIR. 

It is a matter for poignant regret, that the great 
poet of our Northern races never came into the fall 
inheritance of his estate. He might almost be com- 
pared to Aladdin, who, with the Wonderful Lamp 
in his possession, pawned piecemeal, to keep himself 
from starvation, the silver dishes brought him by 
the genie on the first trial of his talisman. Most 
of the tragic themes to which Shakespeare was 
driven, by the ignorance of his age as to its origins 
and mighty past, are certainly inferior. They are his- 
torical, and the long series on English subjects are 
not even great history. It is true that, stirred by 
Shakespeare's breath, lit by the splendor of his im- 
agination and the lambent play of his humor, they 
live and thrive in literature ; but this does not alter 
the fact that they have not the looming largeness, 
the metaphysical profundity, of subjects drawn 
from mythic sources. The Roman tragedies deal 
with world figures; but there is a stiffening and 
formalizing tendency in the Latin character which 
even Shakespeare did not wholly escape. In the 
three tragedies and one romance where Shakespeare 
did seize on myths and legends of his own race, — 
in Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet, and Cymbeline, — he 
rises to the highest heaven of poetic creation. What 
would he not have done had there lain open to his 
hand the themes of Scandinavian mythology, the 
Celtic legends and folk-lore, the cycles of Arthurian 
and Charlemagnic romance ? For myself, I feel so 
strongly that he should have handled all this ma- 
terial, that I let my fancy run riot as to the char- 
acter of his versions, as I do about the lost tragedies 
of i£*chylu8. Possibly that chest of papers which 
Shakespeare's daughter is said to have burned after 
his death contained a Wotan, an Ossian, an Arthur, 
or a Roland. iEschylus described his works as 
crumbs from the banquet of Homer ; and in an- 
other way Shakespeare too had to make the most of 
crumbs, while later poets of his language or lineage 
have been seated at the full, many-course banquet of 
the myths and traditions of our Northern World. 

In the Little Edda, there is a story about Wotan, 
who in one of his wanderings comes to the home of 
certain giants and is challenged to a test of prowess. 
One of the feats he has to perform is to empty a 
mighty drinking-horn in three draughts. He makes 
the attempt, but only slightly lowers the level of 
the liquid in the vessel. His hosts taunt him with 
failure; but afterwards acknowledge that he per- 
formed a feat which made their bones freeze within 
them. For the drinking-horn contained nothing 
less than the ocean, which Wotan's draughts had 
visibly shrunk and ebbed within its shores. The 
modern English poets who have drunk of the foun- 
tain of mythic lore have not done so much as this. 
Tennyson comes off best, with his recast of the 
Arthurian legend; but this poem, pat as it is with 
the peculiarities and prejudices of his own time, 
shows but a doubtful promise of immortality. Swin- 
burne, and Morris, and Arnold have followed him, —

[Oct. 1, 



have written noble poems on themes of Northern 
eld, none of which, however, has imposed itself on 
the world, has become necessary to the thinking of 
civilized humanity. 

Yet the thing has been done, — done, as it were, 
by accident, done as a by-product of another form 
of art, — done by Richard Wagner. That Wagner's 
dramas have not been widely recognized as great 
works of literature is due partly to his own un- 
consciousness of their merit (though he said of 
The Ring when finished that it was the greatest 
poem ever written), partly to his preoccupation 
with the musical side of his adventure, partly 
to the dust which this music has stirred up. In 
the cloud and confusion of the world-wide battle 
over the Music of the Future, the plays have in a 
measure been lost sight of, or have been thrust 
aside as mere libretti of no more importance or 
significance than the lyric books of other operas. 
Yet Wagner's own critical attitude was widely dif- 
ferent from this. He called music the bride of the 
masculine verse, and insisted in many volumes of 
prose polemic that the play was the thing, — that 
music was merely an interpreter of the creative 
part of his work, — that its business was only to 
follow and wait upon and help and adorn the drama. 
That the instinct of mankind dimly perceives this, 
I believe to be the case. What makes the popu- 
larity of the Wagnerian opera ? The music ? I 
doubt it. M. Lavignac, a trained student of Wag- 
ner's music, who has written a book about it, con- 
fesses that, after all his familiarity with the other 
operas, on hearing Tristan for the first time he 
understood nothing at all ; nothing — absolutely 
nothing. Well, then, how is it possible for an ordi- 
nary human being with no especial knowledge of 
music to understand at the first or twentieth time 
Wagner's new system of organized sound ? But 
he can and does appreciate readily enough the 
mighty action, the splendid passion, the humanity, 
and the pictures of the plays. Of course I do not 
wish to say that the music may not have some effect 
on the average listener as well as upon the trained 
musician. But the main things which attract are 
the dramatic skill, the literary art, and the crea- 
tive power of the plays. Possibly in time the 
music may fall away from them, as it has fallen 
away from the tragedies of ^Eschylus and his com- 
peers ; but the dramas will remain, colossal and 
beautiful, — the greatest, I think, that have ap- 
peared since Shakespeare's hand was stilled. 

Poetry deals with emotions, actions, ideas, and 
images. Music deals with emotions alone, or with 
something less definite than emotions, — those sen- 
suous or sub-sensuous affections which lie at the 
root of our being. Music can sway us powerfully, 
of course; but it is neither so coherent nor so 
rememberable as poetry. It may be doubted whether 
Wagner's music, however much it might have in- 
fluenced musicians and their art, would ever have 
got much hold on the hearts or minds of mankind. 
But his ideas and images, his varied human figures 



in their scenic settings, are the property to-day of 
millions of people, — mind-furniture not to be set 
aside or forgotten. 

Wagner's dramas break up into two great groups : 
the legendary one, including Tannhauser, Lohen- 
grin, Tristan, and Parsifal, and the mythical one 
of The Nibelung's Ring. As prologue to these 
there is the brief piece of sombre fire, The Flying 
Dutchman, and as epilogue or interlude the sunny 
comedy of Die Meistersinger. Here are ten 
crown-jewels of Literature which Music has been 
playing with for many years as if they were cheap 
pebbles or common pieces of glass. 

In The Flying Dutchman Wagner struck full 
almost every note in the compass of his literary 
genius. Here is the visuality with which he al- 
ways projects his figures, his marvellous contrast 
of light and shade, his sense of the value of remote 
backgrounds, his terseness of words and hurricane 
swirl of emotion. It is hardly more than a sketch ; 
but what vigor there is in the opening scene ! what 
charm and naturalness in the spinning one ! what 
power in the contrast between the liveliness of 
Daland's crew and the sinister silence of the Dutch- 
man's ship. Considered as a piece of literary art, 
one has to make allowance here, as in the other 
plays, for those lacunae which are filled in by the 
music. Reading it is a little like striding in seven- 
league boots over the peaks and ridges of a moun- 
tainous country. The swiftness with which the 
Dutchman demands a home and wife, and the sud- 
denness of the catastrophe, are real flaws. Wagner 
owed something to Heine's sketch of the legend ; 
but almost everything that makes the piece valu- 
able in a dramatic way is his own, — particularly 
the pathetic figure of the inspired and doom-devoted 
Senta. 

What variety there is in the four legendary 
dramas ! What piling up of pictorial effects ! 
What figures of passion and power ! As was said 
of Chaucer, " Here is God's plenty." Wagner well 
understood that in literature, as in war, one cannot 
have an omelette without breaking eggs. He went 
through his whole career breaking eggs by the hand- 
ful. He shrank from no subject that would give 
him great dramatic effects. It was no timid poet 
who brought Venus and her bacchantes on the stage 
in Tannhauser. The whole play is a struggle be- 
tween sacred and profane Love. Wagner under- 
stood also, extremely well, one essential part of a 
dramatic poet's conduct of his plot, — the contrast, 
that is, of masses with the central figures, the bring- 
ing to bear of varied interests on the main action. 
The singing contest at the Castle of Wartburg is an 
instance of this; and Wagner repeated the same inci- 
dent in a comic way in Die Meistersinger. The crews 
and maidens of The Flying Dutchman, the Rhine 
girls and Valkyrs of the Ring, and the Knights of 
the Holy Grail in Parsifal, are other examples. 

Wagner's real superiority over most modern 
poets in terseness of form and visuality of presen- 
tation comes out in a comparison of his two plays 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



211 



touching on the Holy Grail with Tennyson's Arthur- 
ian epic. Tennyson, by dint of immense detail and 
labored literary art, has projected some pictures 
which live in the mind. Elaine floating down the 
river, Merlin's enchantment by Vivien, the abase- 
ment of Guinevere, and Arthur's death, — these are 
vivid indeed ; yet I think they fail beside com- 
panion pictures from Wagner, — the advent and 
departure of the Hero of the Swan, the struggle be- 
tween Lohengrin and Elsa in their chamber with 
the black shadow of Ortrud below the balcony, 
Parsifal resisting the advances of Kundry in the 
gardens of Elingsor, the Restoration of the Holy 
Lance to the castle of Titurel. In Parsifal, in- 
deed, Wagner has wrought a work of such wonder- 
ful sensuous richness and such profound spiritual 
implications as would alone suffice to place him 
with the immortals. Kundry is a figure such as 
Shakespeare alone, of all the masters, could have 
conceived and executed ; and Ortrud, in Lohen- 
grin, is one of the most magnificent studies of evil 
in modern literature. 

Matthew Arnold, in one of his letters, comments 
on hearing Tristan and Isolde, and says that it is 
very well, but that he prefers his own version. His 
poem is dignified and pathetic, but it is a gentle 
zephyr compared to Wagner's whirlwind in verse. 
Yet this is a monotone ; and if it is a second Romeo 
and Juliet, as has been claimed, it is a much slighter 
thing, and lacks both the naturalness and intoxi- 
cating richness of that supreme love-poem. 

In treating Die Meistersinger as comedy, one 
must premise that German comedy really differs 
from the French and English types. Lessing's 
Minna von Barnhelm approximates to the refined 
and concentrated comedy of those nations ; but the 
real German type of comedy is the scene in Auer- 
bach's cellar in Faust. Here is simply a broad 
picture of low life, with no complication of intrigue 
and no especial sharpness of situation. Wallen- 
stein's Lager is of this genus, and the whole of 
Wagner's play answers to it. To reproach it, there- 
fore, for simplicity of situation, would be useless. 
It gives, as it was intended to do, a perfect picture 
of bustling human life in an old German town ; and 
the figures of Hans Sachs, Pogner, and Beckmesser 
stand out as vivid as reality. They are a true ad- 
dition to the world's repertoire of comic creations. 
The opening scene, where Eva sends Magdalena 
for her handkerchief and brooch, and the faithful 
servant obligingly forgets her own prayer-book in 
order to prolong the lover's interview, is as charm- 
ing and naive as anything in Goethe. 

And now I near my journey's end, and see 
rising on the horizon a long range of glittering and 
collateral peaks — the linked but separated dramas 
of The Ring. In The Rheingold, the whole thesis 
of the work is set forth with baleful presage. It 
is surely as strange a piece as ever dramatist 
dreamed, but despaired, of having set upon the 
stage. Even Wagner, the great master of scenic 
daring, never imagined anything more amazing yet 



enchanting than the opening scene of the Rhine 
maidens disporting in their element. 

Die Walkilre is, I suppose, on the whole the 
world's favorite Wagnerian drama ; and well it 
deserves to be so. Is there anywhere else such a 
succession of lovely or magnificent pictures, such a 
hurry and clash of impetuous action, such a display 
of high-thoughted nobility of womanly character? 
Think of the hut, with the ash-tree growing up 
through its midst ; the entrance of the hunted man ; 
the compassion of the woman ; the collision of the 
enemies. Think of the love-scene, with the May 
moonlight showing through the open door. Then 
comes the dispute between the god and goddess over 
the lovers ; Brtionhilde's errand ; the fight between 
Hunding and Siegmund, and Briinnhilde's revolt. 
Lastly, Briinnhilde's flight with Sieglinde ; the gath- 
ering of the Valkyrs; Wotan's approach on the 
storm ; his rage and broken-hearted despair ; his ban 
upon Biiiunhilde ; his placing her sleeping on the 
rock, clothed in her armor, covered by her shield and 
enclosed in the raging ring of fire. What variety ! 
What vigor! What charm of invention and execution! 

Die Walkilre is Brunnhilde's play. In Siegfried, 
that hero holds the stage throughout, and is drawn 
with a freshness and power hardly equalled outside 
of Homer and Shakespeare. He is the northern 
Achilles, ruder and more primeval than the Greek, 
but equally heroic, equally human. The play has 
in it all the forest romance of Germany, the myste- 
rious lights and shadows of the Smithy in the 
woods; the lair of the dragon, the magic whisper- 
ings of the birds. The scene at the end, when 
Siegfried drives through the ring of fire, cuts 
Biunnhilde's armor and awakes a being new in 
kind to him, is, in long-drawn beauty, splendor, 
and nobility the loftiest love-scene in literature. 
Even Shakespeare, I think, must give place here. 
And the consummating kiss of that incomparable 
pair, Siegfried and Briinnhilde, is the object and 
anticipated moment of the whole Ring. 

After this climax, one must expect a falling off 
in power and interest. The Gotterdammerung is, 
I believe, accounted musically one of the greatest 
of Wagner's works. Structurally, and as a poem, 
it is a failure. Partly this is due to the fact that 
here the Icelandic sagas which Wagner has been 
following come into competition with the Nieb- 
elungenlied. Up to this point, the older myths 
have an infinite superiority in poetry, significance, 
and mystic presage ; but as the catastrophe ap- 
proaches, the Niebelungenlied takes up the story with 
far more tremendous human power. Chriemhilde 
and Hagen, like two towering pillars of cyclonic 
storm, move over the vast areas of the poem ; as 
they approach each other, there comes an appalling 
hush in the air ; they clash, and the earth is deluged 
with a red rain. Compared to the horror and splen- 
dor of the struggle in Etzel's hall, Wagner's trag- 
edy is only the domestic misadventures of a fam- 
ily in good circumstances in mediaeval Germany. 
Partly, I think, the structural failure of the piece is 



212 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



due to Wagner himself. The mere operatic vision, 
dragged in at the end of the burning Walhalla, is 
not enough. For Wotan is really the hero of the 
whole Ring — the Hamlet of the piece. It is he 
who binds together the scattered threads of the 
drama. It is the All- Father's weakness in paltering 
with the base elements of life, that wakes the 
Furies, that brings the tragic issues into action. 
The most pathetic, and, after the closing scene of 
Siegfried, the noblest scene in the work is that 
in which he condemns and punishes his dearest 
daughter, Brunnhilde, for doing what he, in secret, 
wished and inspired her to do. A third reason for 
the lagging of interest in this play is the change in 
the character of Bitlnnhilde. The legends demand 
it, — the essential savagery of human nature de- 
mands it ; but oh, to lose our ideal of the perfect, 
gentle, fearless creature, — the Wish Maiden who 
as an immortal was the protectress of Siegfried's 
infancy, and who, when she put off her divinity, 
became his bride ! 

If anyone desires to measure what Wagner did 
with the Niblung Saga, let him compare The Ring 
with the Sigurd of William Morris. Morris was 
an accomplished versifier, and at times a poet of 
uncommon charm ; but set beside Wagner's terse 
and burning web of words, where every figure is 
visualized with flaming distinctness, every scene set 
forth with the extremest definiteness of light and 
shade, every profound thought borne in upon the 
reader or spectator's mind with awful force, — 
compared with this, Morris's work is but a dull, 
blurred, tedious chronicle in rhyme. 

I have called Wagner Shakespeare's heir. Of 
course, in claiming this precedence I have made 
count only of dramatic poets. I omit from the 
comparison, if comparison there can be, such epic or 
lyric or reflective poets as have won their way to the 
empyrean since Shakespeare's time. And of course 
I do not consider that other order of literary crafts- 
men, the novelists — those Alberich gnomas who 
delve amid the low levels of life. Who is there to 
dispute Wagner's place in the drama ? Not Hugo, 
with his theatre of tinsel and falsetto ; not Ibsen, 
marvellous playwright as he is, but moving amid 
the intricate paths of the drama with his feet en- 
cased in lead ; not Schiller, noble and powerful, but 
lacking in real creative gift. Only Goethe remains. 
Goethe is great and tender and lovely and profound. 
Wagner is great and tender and lovely and pro- 
found. Goethe has probably the advantage in lit- 
erary form, — though this is a point about which, 
unless I greatly mistake, the future will have much 
to say. Both are prattling babes in expression 
compared to Shakespeare, with his gift of tongues. 
None of Goethe's plays has held the boards. You 
could not drive Wagner from the theatre by an 
edict of the law. Goethe epitomized Germany in 
a single work. Wagner summed up our Northern 
races in a series of almost equal plays. For my 
part, I would award him the wreath.

Captain Elers, or the Twelfth Foot.* 

The career of Captain George Elers, of the 
British 12th Regiment of Foot, shines mainly 
through the reflected light of more notable con- 
temporaries. He was a cousin of Maria Edge- 
worth, the sons of Boswell were his schoolmates, 
and he was a personal friend of the hero of 
Waterloo when that distinguished person was 
still Colonel Wellesley. His own achievements 
were not brilliant, but his autobiography, from 
which most of the pleasant volume now issued 
has been edited by his kinsmen, is simply writ- 
ten, and gives a portrait of an officer and gentle- 
man whose life was always interesting to himself 
and far from devoid of interest to others. 

George Elers was born in London on May 
14, 1777, of a noble German family domiciled 
long in England, and died on the island of Jer- 
sey in January, 1842. As a youth he attended 
Doctor Barrow's celebrated school in Soho 
Square, whence, curiously enough, came a num- 
ber of famous English actors. It was here that 
he studied with the two sons of Boswell (though 
Mrs. Boswell is mentioned by her husband often 
enough, further relationships of that best of bi- 
ographers come to one as a surprise), and their 
father would not have been gratified at the 
characterization of them as " clever, but with a 
strong Scotch accent." This appears to be all 
the formal schooling the youth received. His 
father became innocently involved in pecuniary 
difficulties that required his retirement to the 
continent when the young man was eighteen 
years old; his mother died soon after, and in- 
fluence procured for him an ensigncy without 
purchase in the 90th Kegiment. Within a fort- 
night Elers was able to buy a lieutenancy in the 
12th Regiment, and he found himself launched 
upon a military career with what may fitly be 
termed a flying start. It is in accordance with 
the military feeling of the day that the young 
officer has a great deal to say about his ward- 
robe — his colonel, when first waited upon, 
ended the interview " by asking me the name 
of my tailor " — and nothing whatever about 
other possible qualifications. 

War was rife, and Elers's regiment was or- 
dered to Madras by way of the Cape. The

Misses Smith, Jemima and Henrietta, were 
fellow-passengers on the voyage, and the latter 
" afterwards made a conquest of the future 
hero, Colonel Arthur Wellesley," of whom a 
pleasant picture is drawn, the time being in 
September, 1796, when he was just turned 
twenty-seven. 

"At this time he was all life and spirits. In height 
he was about 5 feet 7 inches, with a long, pale face, a 
remarkably large aquiline nose, a clear blue eye, and 
the blackest beard I ever saw. He was remarkably 
clean in his person, and I have known him shave twice 
a day, which I believe was his constant practice. His 
features always reminded me of John Philip Kemble, 
and, what is more remarkable, I observed, many years 
after, the great likeness between him and the per- 
former, Mr. Charles Young, which he told me he had- 
often heard remarked. He spoke at this time remark- 
ably quickly, with, I think, a very, very slight lisp. 
He had very narrow jaw-bones, and there was a great 
peculiarity in his ear, which I never observed but in 
one other person, the late Lord Byron — the lobe of 
the ear uniting to the cheek. He had a particular way, 
when pleased, of pursing up his mouth. I have often 
observed it when he has been thinking abstractly." 

In August, 1797, Elers with half his regi- 
ment took part in the expedition against Man- 
ila which was afterwards abandoned — perhaps 
for the same reasons, now sufficiently obvious 
to thinking Americans, which led Great Brit- 
ain to restore the archipelago to Spain after 
its capture in 1762. While stationed near 
Tajore on the way out, Captain Elers saw the 
" horrid ceremony " of suttee practiced by a 
young widow. 

" I was very near her during the different parts of 
the ceremony, and could have saved her life by merely 
touching her, as she would then have been defiled, and 
would not have been permitted to have the honor of 
sacrificing herself. But in saving her life I stood the 
chance of being torn in pieces, and I certainly should 
have been brought to a court-martial for disobedience 
of orders, for the English in those days were strictly 
forbidden to meddle with the customs and prejudices 
of the natives." 

In the expedition against Seringapatam, 
Elers sets down a failure by Colonel Wellesley 
to obey orders to dislodge the enemy, on which 
he passes the following observation : 

" Had Colonel Wellesley been an obscure soldier of 
fortune, he would have been brought to a court-mar- 
tial, and perhaps received such a reprimand for bad 
management as might have induced him in disgust to 
have resigned His Majesty's service, whereby one of the 
greatest soldiers England ever had would have been 
lost to the country. But Colonel Wellesley, fortu- 
nately for himself and his country, was brother to the 
Governor-General of India, and that was enough to 
wipe away any neglect or bad management." 

For several chapters the narrative is given 
up to accounts of hard fighting, even harder 
drinking, gambling, feasting, and the practice 



of the duello, — interesting to read of but not 
the sort of conduct that raises the profession 
of arms in the estimation of the thoughtful. 
There were ten years of this with Captain 
Elers, and then a return to England, where a 
somewhat similar life was led. Elers speaks 
of his friend Colonel Thornton and the life of 
the time thus: 

" At his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields he gave bad 
dinners but plenty of good wine. I used generally to> 
dine there four days out of the seven, and there I met all 
sorts of people, consisting of actors, authors, painters,. 
musicians, peers, boxers, poets, etc. Of the former I 
have met Kelly, Incledon, Munden, etc. ; Bowden, Rey- 
nolds, etc.; Ashley, Attwood, etc.; Peter Pindar, Lord 
Scarborough, Lord Coleraine (the celebrated George- 
Hanger); Major Wilson, afterwards Lord Berners; 
Daniel Mendoza [the Jewish pugilist] ; Messrs. Wichelo, 
Reinagle, Barrett, and Morland, these last celebrated 
painters, and a variety of others. What scenes of fun, 
wit, and humor I have witnessed at these parties ! I 
have not enumerated one-half of them, and there are 
now very few alive that used ' to set the table in a 
roar.' " 

Life went on in this generous and delightful 
manner for Captain Elers until he was trans- 
ferred to the Maldon Barracks in Essex in 
1811, where he had several months of disa- 
greeable work, followed by really bad luck in 
the matter of promotion. Not only that, but 
Captain Elers at this time sold his commis- 
sions and retired from the army in order to 
overcome the objection held against the pro- 
fession of arms by the mother of a pretty girl 
he was in love with, only to be met after the 
sale with the further — and even more cogent 
— objection that now he had no profession at 
all. At this point the autobiography closes, 
and is followed by numbers of letters from the 
Duke of Wellington, Miss Edgeworth, and 
other persons of consequence. Certain Scotch 
marriages and divorces set the brilliant father 
of a more brilliant daughter to rhyming, and 
Miss Edgeworth quotes him as follows in one 
of her pleasant letters : 

" To ready Scotland boys and girls are carried 
Before their time, impatient to be married. 
Soon wiser grown the selfsame road they runs 
In eager haste to get the knot undone. 
The indulgent Scot, when English law too nice is> 
Sanctions our follies first and then our vices." 

The lines are usually attributed to Sheridan. 
The book closes with a genealogical table 
setting forth the relationship of Elers to the 
noble family of Monson. There is also a com- 
plete index, and a map showing the places men- 
tioned by the writer during his stay in India.

Historic Highways of America.* 

Perhaps the most striking fact in the history 
of the United States is the westward movement 
of population, which in little more than a cen- 
tury filled a continent and furnished the most 
extraordinary example of national expansion 
that has ever taken place. This movement pro- 
ceeded so gradually and quietly that for a long 
time it escaped the notice of the historian; but 
as it has approached completion its magnitude 
and significance have attracted attention to 
such an extent that its study has become the 
historical fad of the hour. One phase of this 
movement, — the highways by which it took 
place, — Mr. Archer Butler Hulbert has taken 
for his field. He published some studies upon 
particular points some time ago, and more 
recently has been expanding and extending 
his former studies into an elaborate series of 
monographs entitled "Historic Highways of 
America." Of this series, six volumes have 
been issued. They treat of Indian and buffalo 
roads ; of the roads of Washington, Braddock, 
and Forbes to the headwaters of the Ohio 
River, and of Boone's " Wilderness " road 
through Cumberland Gap to Kentucky. 

Mr. Hulbert presents at the outset the con- 
clusions that he draws from his studies. The 
first is that the modern highway is a gradual 
evolution from prehistoric times. The buffalo 
made the first roads that it is now possible to 
locate ; the Indians adopted them in part, and 
in part made new ones ; the earliest explorers, 
trappers, and traders followed the Indian trails, 
and these trails were later widened into roads 
for the conquest aud settlement of the country, 
and after settlement the old roads remained 
the chief avenues of communication and finally 
became in large part the routes of the railroads. 
The three great routes of western migration 
were from the New England States up the 
Mohawk valley and overland to the lakes, from 
the Middle States through western Pennsyl- 
vania to the headwaters of the Ohio, and from 
the South through Cumberland Gap to Ken- 
tucky. All three were originally buffalo tracks 
or Indian trails, and two have become routes of 
great trunk railroads. The most interesting 
case of this completed evolution is the Balti-

ington's Road ; Volume IV., Braddock's Road ; Volume

more and Ohio Railroad, which follows the In- 
dian trail very closely, and at two points, where 
it became necessary to tunnel the mountains, 
the tunnels run exactly under the trail. Mr. 
Hulbert's second general conclusion is that the 
Indians and pioneers followed, not the water- 
ways, as is commonly supposed, but the water- 
sheds ; that most of the travel was overland, 
or, in his phrase, that the highways were the 
" highestways." The navigation of the large 
rivers was dangerous, aud the small ones 
could not be depended upon, since they were 
frozen in winter, swollen in spring, and dry in 
summer. The highlands were the lines of least 
resistance, because they avoided the swamps, 
were less thickly wooded, and the wind swept 
them bare of debris in summer and of snow in 
winter. Although perhaps a little overstated, 
these conclusions seem to be borne out by the 
data presented. 

The first two volumes of the series treat of 
Indian and buffalo roads. From the absence 
of buffalo bones in the mounds, the author con- 
cludes that the mound-builders preceded the 
buffalo, and discusses their roads first. It must 
be confessed that this part of the work is purely 
speculative. From the fact that traces of local 
roads approaching or ascending the mounds 
have been found, it is concluded that there must 
have been general roads connecting them. If 
such roads existed, then they must have followed 
the lines of least resistance, which later buffalo 
and Indian instinct proved to be the watersheds. 
Therefore the mound-builders' roads coincide 
with the later ones. This theory is apparently 
sustained by investigations of the Bureau of 
Ethnology, showing that the lines of migration 
of the mound-building Indians lie across rather 
than along the great rivers. The buffalo roads 
are classed as local and transcontinental. The 
local roads, connecting feeding-grounds and salt 
licks, often determined the location of settle- 
ments, and were used for roads by the pioneers. 
In illustration of this fact, it is reported that even 
the main street of Lexington, Kentucky, became 
almost impassable in bad weather, and was de- 
serted for the buffalo road near by. The trans- 
continental roads marked the north and south 
migrations of the buffalo, and were less useful 
to the pioneer because not ordinarily in the line 
of his travel. The later Indian trails, which 
were not " blazed " as many suppose, are de- 
scribed and classified, and the evidence is col- 
lected from early narratives proving their use 
by the pioneers. Then particular descriptions 
are given of the great Indian trails from the

seaboard to the Ohio valley, and of the Indian 
trails of Ohio. 

The third, fourth, and fifth volumes of the 
series treat of the roads of Washington, Brad- 
dock, and Forbes. They tell the story of the 
French and Indian war in the west, from Wash- 
ington's mission to the French forts to Bou- 
quet's defeat of the Indians at Bushy Bun in 
the aftermath of Pontiac's conspiracy. They 
present a good deal of new material, and some in- 
teresting contemporary maps, reproduced from 
originals in the British Museum. The Wash- 
ington volume contains a careful survey of Fort 
Necessity, which supports the plan of Jared 
Sparks as against the one usually accepted ; 
the Braddock volume gives an interesting con- 
temporary journal of the expedition not before 
printed in its original form, and the Forbes vol- 
ume presents a full account of the controversy 
as to whether the old road should be used or a 
new one made. A new one was made, and be- 
came the great highway across the mountains 
until the later Cumberland road revived in part 
the route of Braddock. 

In his sixth volume, Mr. Butler uses Boone's 
road as a basis for the story of the beginnings 
of Kentucky. His argument is that the settle- 
ment of Kentucky saved the West, and that, 
since Boone's road was the means of its settle- 
ment, Boone's road saved the West. Unlike 
the other roads described, this one did not be- 
come a permanent highway but served a purely 
temporary purpose. A number of diaries of 
journeys over the road are given. One was kept 
by William Calk when crossing the mountains 
in 1775. Mr. Butler assumes that the Abra- 
ham Hanks, who started with Mr. Calk's party, 
was the grandfather of Abraham Lincoln, but 
this assumption does not agree with the accepted 
genealogy of Lincoln's mother. Mr. Butler 
exaggerates the extent to which Kentucky was 
purely Virginian and speaks, doubtless by acci- 
dent, of the Wyoming massacre as taking place 
in the State of New York. 

It is easy to find fault with Mr. Hulbert's 
work. He hardly makes good the title of his 
series. So far, he has treated only the high- 
ways of Ohio and neighboring States, and evi- 
dently does not intend to come west of the Mis- 
sissippi ; that is not all of America, nor even of 
the United States, by any means. He always 
speaks of Ohio as the Central West, as it once 
was, but it is now the Eastern West. His style 
is somewhat inflated and characterized by some 
mannerisms, especially a habit of preparing a 
surprise at the end of a sentence, which becomes 



tiresome. Occasionally his imagination runs 
away, as when he says that the Delawares 
"range to-day over a million acres on the Kan- 
sas river and its tributaries, still dreaming of 
the time when they will again assume their his- 
toric position at the head of the Indian family." 
It is thirty-five years since the Delawares were 
removed from Kansas, and their former reser- 
vation is now the richest and most populous 
section of the State ; while the conditions at 
present obtaining in the Indian Territory are 
such that it is scarcely possible that they dream 
the dreams attributed to them. He indulges 
in a good deal of hazardous conjecture, such as 
the statement that the English conquest of the 
continent would have been easier "had Provi- 
dence reversed the decree which allowed French- 
men to settle the St. Lawrence and Englishmen 
the Atlantic seaboard." The English position 
certainly had more advantages, among others 
the military one of enabling them to strike from 
interior lines. He also repeats a great deal, and 
presents much irrelevant matter. But notwith- 
standing these faults, Mr. Hulbert has the great 
merit of writing with enthusiasm and of vividly 
portraying the conditions that obtained during 
the period of which he treats. He has struck 
a new vein, developed novel ideas, and pro- 
duced some very entertaining books.

Stevenson's Religious Faith.* 



Reversals of judgment are common enough 
in all phases of literary history, and striking 
examples are not hard to find in the past or in 
the present. The novel that impelled the re- 
viewers to shriek at "Currer Bell" for immo- 
rality has its place to-day in reading-lists for 
young people ; the cynical Thackeray has be- 
come the soft-hearted ; Mr. Chesterton has 
only just finished explaining to us very con- 
vincingly that what we had condemned as form- 
lessness and obscurity in Robert Browning's 
verse should be recognized as excess of the 
opposite virtues. And perhaps as notable an 
instance as any is furnished by the latest addi- 
tion to Stevensonian criticism, " The Faith of 
Robert Louis Stevenson," by the Reverend 
John Kelman, Jr., of the Free New North 
Church, Edinburgh. Much water has flowed 
under the theological bridges since 1873, when 
the home of Thomas Stevenson was made un-

happy by the " horrible atheism " of his son ; 
and what might have been discomforting het- 
erodoxy even in a layman of that epoch may 
to-day be uttered safely enough from the pul- 
pit itself. We know now that the " family theo- 
logian " of Heriot Row lived to learn that the 
current had not carried the stray from Calvin- 
ism hopelessly beyond all shelter of belief. But 
it is safe to say that at the time when the future 
writer was struggling with the difficulties of 
his youth, the idea of a book such as Mr. 
Kelman has written would have been dis- 
missed from the mind of the elder Stevenson 
as a worse than fantastic improbability. 

The theme of Mr. Kelman's book, as the 
author reminds us, has under various names 
received more or less detailed attention from 
most Stevensonian critics. But Mr. Kelman 
is the first to discuss the topic at length from 
the standpoint of official clericalism, and from 
that position to consider as faith what others 
have called Stevenson's " attitude to life," 
" optimism," etc. " It is only beginning to be 
realized," he tells us, in an admirably- written 
preface, "that Stevenson had a message to 
his times, and that his faith is to be taken 
seriously." In interpreting the religious ele- 
ment of this message, Mr. Kelman has al- 
lowed himself great freedom. It is needful 
to recall Professor James's recent definition of 
religion as "a man's total reaction upon life " 
in order to get rid of surprise at such chapter- 
headings as " The Gift of Vision " and " The 
Instinct of Travel." Another quotation from 
the preface will, however, best indicate the 
writer's attitude toward his subject : 

"The type of faith which his own words declare 
is peculiarly valuable at the present time. There is 
around us much unconscious Christianity. There are 
strong men whom God has girded though they have not 
known Him, and quiet men who do not seem to be fol- 
lowing Christ, and yet unquestionably are casting out 
devils. These are the men who will best appreciate 
Stevenson's faith. Its unconventionality, its freedom 
from dogmatic expression, and the inseparable weaving 
of it into the warp and woof of his life's various activ- 
ities, must appeal to many who have found themselves 
out of sympathy with the external forms of modern 
Christianity, though in heart they have remained true 
to its spirit." 

To some readers — and they perhaps not the 
least Stevensonian of Stevensonians — it may 
seem that Mr. Kelman has brought to his Home 
more than a little of what he has found there. It 
is not easy, for example, to assent unqualifiedly 
to the following sentence, which summarizes a 
discussion of Stevenson's marvellous power of 
reliving his childhood. " It will be apparent 



to every reader that all this has a religious as 
well as a psychological significance." And if 
the revelation of personality is in itself a lit- 
erary manifestation of the religious instinct, 
there are some odd pagan and semi-pagan 
figures which may find their way into that gal- 
ley with Stevenson. But even though we may 
at times be conscious of the special pleader 
in some of the deductions, the consciousness 
counts for very little in view of much admir- 
able criticism in which the insight is as evi- 
dent as the frankly-avowed enthusiasm. 

The closeness of the relation between Stev- 
enson the writer and Stevenson the man — 
which is the starting-point for almost all Stev- 
ensonian criticism — has made it possible for 
Mr. Kellman to consider very varied aspects 
of his author's personality and work. 

In the chapters on " Subjectivity," " The 
Child," " Revolt and Originality," much that 
is familiar is retold sympathetically, and the 
ethical significance of characteristics such as 
conscious egoism, the recurrence of particular 
images, the directness and vividness of physical 
impressions, is newly insisted upon. Of es- 
pecial interest in the chapter on books is 
the division which shows just how much the 
covenanting writers counted for among the 
contents of that strange literary crucible in 
which Stevenson fused his style. And nothing 
could be more delightful reading to the lovers 
of the earlier, inconsequent Stevenson of the 
" Essay on Roads " and " Forest Notes " than 
the two chapters on " The Instinct of Travel," 
the charm of which is not lessened by the 
perception of the fact that their writer is not 
seldom more of a royalist than his king. 
The concluding chapters, " Manliness and 
Health," "The Great Task of Happiness," 
and finally " Stevenson and his Times," deal 
with Stevenson's philosophy as he definitely 
enunciated it. Mr. Kelman analyzes Steven- 
son into " a Hebrew conscience and a Greek 
imagination, a Scottish sense of sin and a 
French delight in beauty," and perceives in 
him the chief representative of the New Hel- 
lenism, the note of whose spirit is the health and 
gladness which arises out of an energetic and 
compassionate life. 

It will not be necessary to accept all Mr. 
Kelman's conclusions in order to recognize that 
the publication of his book is in itself a proof of 
the thesis he maintains. Whether or not Stev- 
son's message is of such a nature as to include 
all the essential elements of Christianity as it 
may be preached from a pulpit, it is still a mes-

sage to which many have listened, and which a 
dweller in the manse has found it well to inter- 
pret. And how much more fortunate in their 
prophet are Stevenson's listeners than their 
fathers, whom Arnold and Clough and Tenny- 
son made half in love with despair, or at best 
taught to trust blindly in a vague hope, lit- 
erary historians have already noted. There 
are some critics according to whom Stevenson 
came dangerously near to forfeiting his artistic 
birthright when he made it possible for a 
book to be written dealing with all that 
the term " faith " includes. They are might- 
ily offended that the graceful essayist and 
teller of tales should have permitted him- 
self to "descant upon morals"; and the fam- 
ous characterization of " Shorter Catechist " 
is quoted by them with a sigh of reproach. 
44 A shameless Bohemian haunted by duty," 
Mr. Henry James has called him ; and the 
need for the qualification is unforgiven. But 
a greater than Stevenson survives the critics' 
blame for being the " week-day preacher " he 
called himself, and so long as there are 
Teaders who resemble Marjorie Fleming in at 
least the first two items of her confession that 
<l she never reads sermons, but only novelettes 
and her Bible," there will be those who will not 
regret the possible loss to art in view of the 
compensation. For, taking Stevenson's utter- 
ance to his generation as little seriously as may 
be, he has given to all who can hear him a " part- 
nership of interest in youth." And, if as some 
will have it, that is his best gift, we can afford 
to accept what he has chosen to offer with it, 
and be grateful. 



Two More Books about Siena.* 



Lying as she does off the direct routes of 
travel in much-travelled Italy, Siena has hith- 
erto escaped the attention of all but the more 
leisurely tourists, and has been one of the 
most neglected of Italian cities. She has also 
escaped the notice of those who have travelled 
the delightful ways of local history and de- 
scriptive literature. The bibliography of the 
subject is small, and until recently no complete 
history of the city has appeared in any lan- 
guage. Yet Siena has many advantages over

York : The Macmillan Co. 



those Italian cities that have diverted the at- 
tention of tourists and writers from her. She 
is the most perfectly mediaeval of them all, and 
remains practically the same as she was in the 
middle of the sixteenth century. Enclosed 
within fourteenth-century walls, and with an 
abundance of mediaeval and Renaissance build- 
ings in her streets of a style distinctly Sienese, 
she maintains a striking individuality that 
makes it impossible to institute a comparison 
between her and any other city. 

At one time the architecture of Siena was 
enriched by towers so numerous that the city 
was hyperbolically likened to a canebrake, by 
those who saw her from a distance. Some of 
these towers were destroyed in the factional 
wars that were waged about them ; yet those 
that remain are entitled to an honored place 
among the Italian towers whence modern 
architects derive suggestions. Siena was once 
of great commercial and manufacturing im- 
portance, the wealthy capital of a prosperous 
republic, the home of bankers who financed 
the Papacy, and boasted a population of more 
than a hundred thousand souls. The Black 
Death visited Siena for six months about the 
middle of the fourteenth century, and not only 
reduced her population but checked the execu- 
tion of her ambitious plans for a cathedral of 
greater size and rarer beauty than that of her 
great rival, Florence. The transept, all that 
was built of the magnificent church that had 
been planned, remains to-day the most beauti- 
ful of the Italian cathedrals, and the city is 
filled with art-treasures representing schools of 
painting and sculpture distinct from all others 
in the history of art. 

But at last Siena is coming to her own in a 
literary way if in no other. The appearance 
of no less than five books in the English lan- 
guage within the last few months, all upon 
various phases of the city's life and history, is 
evidence that she is no longer to be allowed to 
hide her charms from the passers-by. Three 
of these books have been already noticed in 
The Dial ("The Pavement Masters of Siena," 
by Mr. R. H. Hobart Cust ; " Siena, Its Archi- 
tecture and its Art," by Mr. Gilbert Hastings ; 
and " A Guide to Siena," by Mr. William Hey- 
wood). The two admirably printed and richly 
illustrated volumes now before us claim to 
deal with the city chiefly from the historic 
standpoint. The larger of these, Professor 
Douglas's " History of Siena," presents that 
history in fifteen chapters, comprising 264 of 
the somewhat less than 500 pages of his book.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Professor Gardner devotes the first chapter of 
his " Story of Siena " to its history. The re- 
maining chapters in either book are devoted to 
other matters pertaining to the city. 

This is not to say, however, that the proper 
proportions have been unobserved in either 
case. The history of Siena closed in 1555, 
when after a long struggle the Ghibelline 
city-republic succumbed to her more powerful 
Guelph rival, was deprived of her liberty, and 
became henceforth a " kind of glorified pro- 
vincial town." For the past three and a half 
centuries she has followed the fortunes of 
the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Hers was but 
an inconspicuous share in the great national 
awakening of Italy in recent years. 

Had Mrs. Oliphant attempted for Siena 
what she did for Venice and Florence, she 
would have found among "The Makers of 
Siena " previous to the sixteenth century 
enough to engage her interest. There were 
saints like San Ansano, St. Catharine, and San 
Bernardino ; ecclesiastics like Orlando Ban- 
dinello and Eneas Sylvius Piccolomini, whom 
Siena contributed to the Papacy as Alexander 
III. and Pius II. respectively ; bankers like 
the Salembini and the Chigi ; political leaders 
like Pandolfo Petrucci ; architects like Santa 
Maria di Provenzano, Agostino di Giovanni, 
and Agnolo di Ventura ; sculptors like Nicolo 
Pisano and Giacomo della Quercia; and 
painters like Giovanni Antonio Bozzi, usually 
known as Sodoma. To all these due atten- 
tion is given in both the " History " and the 
" Story." 

The books are delightful guide-books, not 
only to the city that now is, and to the art- 
treasures with which she is filled, but to her 
history and all else that may be learned about 
the city of the Tuscan Hills. To Professor 
Gardner's delightful chapters upon Siena, he 
adds two upon San Gimignano, the suburban 
"Town of the beautiful towers"; and a touch 
of present-day human interest is given to the 
book by the fact that the artist to whom was 
due the exquisite drawings illustrating the text, 
died while the work was in progress, and to her 
memory the author and publisher dedicate the 
" Story of Siena."

Recent Fiction.* 



A new novel by Mr. James Lane Allen is in 
the nature of a literary event, for he is of the small 
number who put conscience into their writing, and 
never publish anything that is not the product of 
painstaking effort. His " Choir Invisible " of a few 
years ago set a new mark in our modern fiction, 
and almost made us feel that Hawthorne had found 
a worthy successor. But " The Reign of Law," 
which came next, fell far below the mark set by 
its predecessor, being labored in its thesis, and ob- 
trusively didactic in its treatment. We regret to 
say that Mr. Allen's new novel, " The Mettle of the 
Pasture," is also a disappointment, and for much 
the same reasons. The sermonizing is perhaps not 
so pronounced, but the lack of spontaneity is quite 
as evident. The title itself is hopelessly forced, 
and requires a lengthy explanation which somehow 
does not explain altogether to our satisfaction. The 
situation upon which the story rests is both simple 
and familiar. The hero, during the years spent by 
him at a Northern college long before the story 
opens, has betrayed a young girl. A child has been 
born of their union, but has been legitimized by her 
timely marriage with another man. The betrayer 
returns to his Southern borne with this secret gnaw- 
ing at his heart, wins the love of the heroine, and 
is about to become engaged to her. The ordinary 
novelist's treatment of this situation would be to 
have the secret revealed by some outside means or 
accidental circumstance. The discovery would be 
made more important than the thing itself. But 
Mr. Allen's hero does not wait for his sin to find 
him out; he makes a clean breast of it at the critical 
moment, and the outraged young woman at once 
ends the relations between them. After several 
years of suffering for both, his feelings soften, and 
in the end the two are married, but not soon enough 
to spare for very long the broken life of the hero. 
His dying wish is a prayer for his infant son: 
" This is my prayer for you : may you find one to 
love you such as your father found ; when you come 
to ask her to unite her life with yours, may you be 
prepared to tell her the truth about yourself, and 
have nothing to tell that would break her heart and 
break the hearts of others." The note of pathos

here is exactly right, and the teaching of the story, 
as far as it upholds the principle that the moral 
standard for the two sexes should he one and the 
same, is absolutely just. The style of the narrative, 
also, has a grave beanty and a subtlety of tonch 
that are beyond the reach of more than a very few 
of our novelists. But the situation above ontlined 
does not afford matter enongh for a book of this 
length, and the author has been singularly un- 
fortunate in his provision of subordinate characters 
and subsidiary episodes. These have little organic 
relation to his text, and are conceived in anything 
but a happy fashion. And in one instance at least 
(found at the close of Book I., Chapter 9) the author 
has so far lapsed from probability and good taste, 
has permitted himself so grotesque an aberration of 
style and characterization, that we read with sheer 
amazement what he has written, and rub our eyes 
to make sure that the words are really there. If 
the thing is intended for humor, Mr. Allen should 
offer up a fervent prayer to be delivered from all 
future temptations to be humorous, for of such are 
the promptings of the Fiend. 

Paul Clitheroe was a young poet and journalist 
who lived in San Francisco in the seventies. He 
had an engaging personality, and made many 
friends, particularly among women. The practical 
problems of life were difficult for him to master, 
because anything like routine or patient endeavor 
was abhorrent to his artistic nature. He tried many 
experiments by way of making a living, including a 
few weeks as an actor in a provincial troupe. Being 
a Catholic, he sought counsel from his confessor, 
but could get no lasting consolation in that quarter. 
He was a Bohemian, a dreamer, almost a mystic, 
and his restless soul brooded perpetually over the 
enigma of existence. His life was a confessed fail- 
ure, yet it had its hours of quiet satisfaction and 
even serenity of outlook. In his younger days, he 
had wandered in many countries, and had known 
the languid island life of the Southern seas. One 
day he disappeared from his customary haunts, and 
his friends knew him no more. Rumor had it that 
he had joined the Franciscans and was living the 
contemplative life in a Venetian community. In 
fact, he had been drawn away to the Southern seas, 
impelled by an irresistible memory of the ancient 
charm, and, like Waring, had dropped out of the 
ken of civilization. A series of the episodes in this 
troubled career — if so futile a life-history may be 
called a career — put together without much regard 
to their actual time-sequence, is given us in a book 
entitled "For the Pleasure of his Company." 
When we say that the author is Mr. Charles War- 
ren Stoddard, nothing need be added for those to 
whom this name has already made its magic appeal ; 
for others, we may say that the book, for all its ram- 
bling and inconsequent manner, is a piece of charm- 
ing literature, the expression of a spirit unfettered 
by the conventions, freely disporting itself in its 
own native element of imagination and fantasy. 

Mr. Meredith Nicholson, the historian of litera- 



ture in Indiana, has bestowed much praise upon his 
fellow-citizens addicted to authorship. Meanwhile, 
he has been producing literature of his own in a 
modest way — poetry, criticism, and now a novel, 
which is a far more creditable piece of work than 
most of the Indiana products that he has marked 
for laudation. It is a novel of modern life, largely 
a novel of the world of business, the scene being 
laid in an aspiring Western town which seems to be 
situated somewhere on the Missouri River. The 
practical interest culminates in a struggle for the 
control of the local traction company, although we 
think that when the critical moment is reached, the 
author might have dealt more strikingly with the 
situation. The romantic and personal interest of 
the novel is created by a young woman, the daughter 
of the local magnate, for whose hand three men 
are claimants. We are kept guessing until near 
the close, when the atmosphere is cleared by the 
death of one and the flight of another, a victim of 
moral cowardice. There is also a flamboyant local 
festival and a mysterious abduction. Out of these 
materials " The Main Chance '' is constructed, and 
with such skill as to keep the interest sustained 
throughout. Mr. Nicholson knows intimately the 
scenes and types which he manipulates, and his 
work is craftsmanlike and meritorious in a marked 
degree. 

Some time ago, Mr. William Farquhar Payson 
wrote a historical novel of the Lost Colony in Vir- 
ginia, and made it noteworthy by the somewhat 
audacious introduction of the figure of Christopher 
Marlowe. He now presents us with a novel of mod- 
ern conditions entitled " The Triumph of Life." 
Unfortunately, he has acquired a taste for fine 
writing, and the result is a novel that is unpleas- 
antly strained and fantastical in manner. A young 
collegian writes a novel filled with noble thoughts. 
It fails of success, and he is plunged into gloom 
and cynicism. Then a most exasperating young 
woman treats him badly, and he resolves to have 
done with idealism, and win success by pandering to 
the lower tastes of the public. His name is Enoch 
Lloyd, and he discovers one day that he can give to 
it the anagrammatic form of Dolly Cohen. Under 
this pseudonym he writes sensational rubbish which 
has a large sale. Then he tries to write noble 
thoughts once more, and finds that the power has 
left him. Meanwhile his first book has a belated 
success, and he is sorry that he deserted his ideals. 
He is elected to the Millennial Club, an introduc- 
tory banquet is arranged for him, and there, in- 
stead of accepting the honor with thanks, he makes 
an open breast of his literary turpitude, and resigns. 
This is the triumph of life, and averts the sinister 
influence of an impossible young woman of French 
extraction who thinks she has him in her toils. In 
the end, the exasperating young woman first men- 
tioned behaves more reasonably, he gets back his 
lost inspiration, and the future is made bright. This 
is the material for a good story, but it is wellnigh 
spoiled by an artificial intensity and all sorts of 



156 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



inflated mannerisms. Unhappily, we cannot all be 
Merediths, and it is just as well for most of us to 
recognize this hard fact. 

"The Lions of the Lord," by Mr. Harry Leon 
Wilson, is a chronicle history of Mormonism done 
into fiction. It begins with the expulsion from Nau- 
voo of the followers of that very cheap prophet, 
Joseph Smith, and goes on to tell about the journey 
across the plains, the settlement in Salt Lake Val- 
ley, the growth of the theocratic community, the 
deeds of the Danites and the Mountain Meadow 
massacre, the schemes of the crafty Brigham, the 
fanaticism of his dupes, and the long conflict with 
the Federal authorities. As the author warns us, 
" the make-believe is hardly more than a cement to 
join the queerly-wrought stones of fact that were 
found ready." Still, there is enough of romantic 
interest to keep the narrative alive, and the leading 
character offers an interesting study in the tempera- 
ment of the religious enthusiast. But this is a case 
in which the truth is stranger than any possible fic- 
tion, and the author has done well in keeping close 
to history. Mormonism is worth knowing about, 
because it typifies a form of human credulity that 
finds examples — although less striking ones — in 
the history of every age. The vulgar tirades of 
Brigham, as they are reproduced in these pages, are 
paralleled in the spirit, and almost in the letter, by 
the outpourings of a present-day religious charlatan, 
who plays upon the same coarse fibres of human 
nature, and who likewise counts his followers by the 
thousands. 

The Rev. Bradley Gilman, in writing "Ronald 
Carnaquay," has sought to portray two contrasted 
types of the modern clergyman ; the one a quiet 
worker of fine fibre and absolute purity of motive, 
the other an ornate person of strictly superficial 
attainments and wholly devoid of spirituality. A 
New England city of moderate size is the scene of 
this story, which is chiefly concerned with the fort- 
unes of the two clergymen in question, and with the 
church which first the one, and then the other, has 
in charge. The author's purpose — for this is a 
book with a purpose, if there ever was one — may 
be gathered from these prefatory words : " When 
a church and preacher disregard the sacred leader- 
ship of Truth, and undervalue the worth of pastoral 
ministration, and subordinate worship to amuse- 
ment, and when they test the merit or strength of a 
church and minister solely by mercantile standards, 
then that preacher and people have become com- 
mercial and sordid ; then the higher vision is with- 
drawn ; and where there is no vision, the people 
perish." Mr. Gilman writes from the fulness of 
knowledge, and, while his work has little to com- 
mend it as a work of fiction, its value as a sociolog- 
ical study is considerable. Most serious people feel 
that the clerical profession, more than any other — 
unless we admit the politician to the professional 
classes — is exposed to influences of so subtly de- 
moralizing a nature that it takes a strong man in- 
deed to escape their contagion. It is in its analysis 



of these influences that the strength of " Ronald 
Carnaquay" is found, and in the force with which 
the spiritual, as opposed to the commercial, ideal of 
the minister's calling is presented. 

Mr. Justus Miles Forman's new novel, "Mon- 
signy," is a thin and sugary performance which 
pretends to depict deep passions, but hardly comes 
within speaking distance of actual life. The central 
situation is so hopelessly far-fetched and strained 
that the story has about as much reality as a fairy 
tale, and is, besides, characterized by cheap theat- 
rical effects and artificial sentimentality. The doll 
heroine, the wooden manikin hero, and the hyster- 
ical woman who tries to be their evil genius are alike 
uninteresting and unreal. The action takes place 
in a French chateau — the Monsigny of the title — 
but the characters are all English except the doll 
heroine, whose mother was French. 

" The Silver Poppy " is a novel of literary and 
artistic life in New York, and is written by Mr. 
Arthur Stringer. It is about a young Englishman 
from Oxford, doing slum work and hack journalism 
in the American metropolis, and a young woman 
from Kentucky, who has scored a great success with 
a novel called "The Silver Poppy." Unfortunately, 
her reputation is based upon the filching of another 
man's brains, and when a second novel is demanded 
of her by the impatient public, she is in a hopeless 
impasse. Here the Englishman comes to her rescue, 
and rewrites her manuscript, making a strong and 
vital thing out of it. He also falls in love with her, 
not knowing of her past deceit. When the facts 
come out, he goes back to England, and she is left 
despairing. He is a good deal of a prig, and the 
young woman is better off without him, did she but 
know it. The whole action of the story is uncon- 
vincing, and we are not greatly concerned about 
what happens to any of the characters. The best 
thing about the book is its semi-humorous account 
of the conditions of journalism as it is viewed by 
the commercial syndicate in whose hands the hero 
is a victim, during his early apprenticeship to the 
trade. " The bureau had a Menu Page, too, made 
up by a very lean and hungry-looking old gentleman 
who lunched sparingly on a sandwich each noon, 
and a Religious Thought Page, edited by a very 
stout individual who kept a brandy-flask standing 
beside his ink-bottle." This is the sort of thing we 
mean, mildly amusing and yet reasonably truthful 
in its revelations. William Morton Payne. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



A war in society between rival cliques, with the in- 
terest centring in a beautiful woman, is ideal subject 
matter for historical romance, as Mr. Alfred Henry 
Lewis proves in " Peggy O'Neal " (Drexel Biddle) . 
The heroine, a sweet, sensible, and beautiful Irish 
woman, daughter of a Washington tavern-keeper, be- 
comes the wife of Andrew Jackson's Secretary of War, 
John Henry Eaton. Her antecedents, and envy of the 
charm she exerts over the men who come in contact

with her, induce the other ladies of the Cabinet to re- 
fuse to her social recognition. President Jackson 
espoused her cause in the thorough-going way char- 
acteristic of him, with the result that his Cabinet was 
eventually disrupted. These are the historical facts 
upon which the story is based, and the incident stands 
quite by itself in our national annals. But the treat- 
ment of the story, its vividness of presentation and 
realization of the time, are entirely Mr. Lewis's. He 
-writes in a quaint, individual manner, with abundant 
humor, setting the narrative in the mouth of one of 
Jackson's " kitchen cabinet," and enabling the reader 
of to-day to form an estimate of "Old Hickory" 
hardly to be obtained in any other way. 

Mr. I. Zangwill seems to be coming into the requisite 
prominence to justify a uniform edition of his prose 
writings, and " The Grey Wig, Stories and Novelettes " 
(Macmillan) is a step in that direction. It contains 
some of his earliest as well as some of his latest work, 
as he is careful to explain in a prefatory note; yet it 
leaves a general impression of uniform strength and 
skill, various as are the subjects treated. These range 
from a study of the French bourgeoisie, through British 
politics, feminine psychology exhibited in love-making, 
an Arctic explorer in London society, a good old-fash- 
ioned murder story with a modern denouement, a serving 
maid who inherits millions, to a little Irish lady who is 
at once a governess to the young and a singer in music- 
halls. More variety could hardly be contrived, and the 
treatment is quite as versatile as the choice of themes. 
Nothing Mr. Zangwill has written, not even " The 
Schnorrer," leaves quite so strong an impression of his 
mastery of English humor, while the evenness of treat- 
ment, diversified in time as is the work, must be con- 
sidered remarkable. 

Notwithstanding that Mr. Nathaniel Stephenson has 
made an undeniably good story of his ■ Eleanor Day- 
ton " (John Lane), it is so complete a disappointment 
as regards the working out of the love element that it 
will hardly be judged fairly by the average reader. 
The heroine, whose name is lent to the book, is one of 
the most beautiful of women, the descendant of two col- 
onial families of distinction in Maryland and southern 
Ohio. Yet she is disposed of toward the close of the 
book as a decayed gentlewoman, keeper of a boarding- 
house, and the companion of fashionable young ladies 
desiring a European tour. This is not an alluring fate, 
and Mr. Stephenson does not succeed in proving that 
Eleanor did anything to deserve it. The trick of taking 
the most dramatic scene in the book out of its due 
place and using it for the opening chapter, though 
sanctioned by age and authority, here gives an im- 
pression largely erroneous and is responsible for much 
of the disappointment. Yet the book is ably written, 
and in some of the battle pictures of the civil war 
approaches excellence, while proving on almost every 
page the right of the author to rank among the most 
promising of younger American writers. 

A conscientious and able workman, Mrs. Ellen Olney 
Kirk will lose nothing in reputation by the publication 
of "Good-Bye, Proud World" (Houghton). The tale 
opens in a New York newspaper office, discovering the 
heroine in the person of the editor of the ■ Hearth and 
Home " department. She is a woman past early youth, 
of excellent connections, practically alone in the world, 
respected by her associates, always busy, and from a 
man's point of view overworked. She longs exceed- 
ingly for rest — not a mere vacation, but a lifetime 



with no more writing nor newsgetting, nor drafts on 
ingenuity perpetual and insistent. To her comes — as 
happens so much oftener in novels than in real life — 
an elderly lawyer to inform her that she is the sole 
survivor of her father's family, and as such entitled to 
a pleasant little property in a New England seaport 
town, including an old-fashioned house and investments 
enough to maintain it. The scene then shifts to the 
new home, and a pretty romance begins, well conceived 
and thoroughly knit together. The book is delightful 
reading, and of more than usual merit. 

One of those annoying slips which arise to the dis- 
comfiture of authors appears in Mr. Vance Thompson's 
"Spinners of Life" (Lippincott). Though the fact is 
not mentioned directly, and the inference is in just the 
other direction, Mr. Thompson makes bis protagonist 
at least nine years younger than his heroine, — that is, 
the night his father killed her's she was "a fright- 
ened child of ten " (page 57), and he " was a baby " 
(page 216). The story turns upon the willingness of a 
man deliberately to slay another whom he has never 
seen, by seemingly innocent means, for the sake of 
great financial gain, — a temptation to which the son of 
the murderer succumbs. The situation, though essenti- 
ally stated by J. J. Rousseau, is a novel one, and is 
most originally worked out, lending the book an inter- 
est it could not have had otherwise. The scene is in 
New York, and classes in society not ordinarily met 
are involved. The book is marred here and there by 
too obvious symbolism. 

Mr. George Barr McCutcheon has put far behind 
him the atmosphere of romance in his third book, " The 
Sherrods " (Dodd), making it a story of life in a farm- 
ing community in Indiana and in Chicago. The action 
is not the principal feature of this book, which follows 
the more ambitious plan of showing how one human 
soul can sink into the depths through over-much pros- 
perity, while another ascends the heights through love 
of a woman both good and pretty. Depending in this 
way upon subjective rather than objective processes, 
there is small chance for intricacies of plot, but there 
is still a flavor of melodrama which keeps dulness 
aloof. The protagonist of the story succeeds in marry- 
ing two good women, an ingenious way of introducing 
an element of immorality or vice without in any manner 
reflecting upon American womanhood. The most 
apparent criticism to be brought against Mr. McCutch- 
eon's story is that he has given himself too little room 
for the full development of so purely psychical a study. 
Nor has he been able to devise a sufficiently heaping 
reward for his good young man. 

Mrs. Alfred Lawrence Felkin, known to novel read- 
ers under her maiden name of Ellen Thorneycroft 
Fowler, has written "Place and Power" (Appleton), a 
story of two English families which raise themselves 
from provincial obscurity to the highest places of 
power in the United Kingdom. The story develops 
itself by leaps and bounds, covering more than half a 
century and ending in the living present. Somewhat 
disconnected as a result of this treatment, the book is 
made disagreeable by a certain narrowness of view 
which is the more marked because similar narrowness 
in one of the families discussed comes in for so much 
reprobration at the novelist's hands. One of the 
families is atheistical, the other of the established 
church. A curse pronounced upon the head of the 
former house working itself ont feebly through the 
later portions of the narrative gives Mrs. Felkin the 



158

[Oct. % 



element of the supernatural she so affects, but its con- 
clusion, though ingenious, is not in the least inspiring. 
The appeal of the book is markedly British, politics 
playing a principal part, so that the interest for Amer- 
ican readers is comparatively slight, and difficult to 
estimate at its true value. 

Mr. Justin Huntly McCarthy's " Marjorie " (R. H. 
Russell) continually suggests Stevenson's "Treasure 
Island." There are pirates enough and to spare, and, 
too, they conspire to obtain possession of a ship fitted 
out for a lawful purpose. Shipwreck ensuing, the bet- 
ter inclined among the crew erect a stockade and under- 
go a seige from the pirates, whose efforts would have 
been crowned with success did not a frigate send the 
customary shell into their midst at exactly the right 
moment. The differences chiefly lie in the two women 
who figure in the story, one on each side, the nice one 
lending her name to the book and her fate to the hero's, 
while the other one is wedded to the pirate king. 
Melodramatic as the book is, it is a great improvement 
on its predecessor, " If I Were King." 

Mr. Rider Haggard has left South African novels 
and South African history, and, seemingly getting as 
far from both as possible, gleans the grain for his 
" Pearl Maiden " (Longmans) from the ripe harvest of 
Josephus. Very early Christians, Essenes, and the fall 
of Jerusalem, afford him abundant opportunity to 
exhibit his matured powers of imagination and descrip- 
tion, the details of the siege and its termination being 
too horrible to permit of elaboration. It cannot be said 
that the resulting story is as interesting as some of his 
later romances, particularly those in which the redoubt- 
able Umslopogaas figures ; but there is a compensating 
ripeness and reserve. The heroine is a beautiful figure, 
one likely to remain in the mind, and quite the best 
conception Mr. Haggard has embodied in his fictional 
work — which includes his history. 

The notable difference between the tales of the 
French capital in Mr. Guy Wetmore Carryl's " Zut and 
Other Parisians" (Houghton) and other similar tales 
is that these are really French, in conception, material, 
and execution, and the incidents as well as the atmos- 
phere can hardly be thought of in any other connection. 
There are eleven of them altogether, dealing with 
every social rank from the millionaire to the burglar, 
more than half taking in those in the humbler walks of 
life. For all these various conditions Mr. Carryl has 
an abundant sympathy, the more marked in this par- 
ticular instance because in a previous book he showed 
himself entirely without sympathy for the working 
people who are his countrymen. " Zut and Other Par- 
isians " is commendable for many things, not least for 
having a decided style of its own, somewhat Gallicized, 
to be sure, but straightforward, sufficiently clear and 
simple, and with a nice perception of the mot juste. Its 
principal element, perhaps, is a delightful humor, read- 
ily shading into pathos. 

The incursion of the Young Pretender, culminating 
in the fatalities of Culloden, is the historical episode 
about which Mrs. Amelia £. Barr has grouped the suc- 
cessive love-stories of her heroine in the book called by 
her name, "Thyra Varrick" (J. F. Taylor & Co.). 
The two lovers arrive at a decision regarding the girl 
at the same moment, and quarrel bitterly before she 
takes the Highlander MacDonald in the face of her 
father's strenuous opposition. He is made captive on 
his wedding day, but when he sets out to wreak his 
vengeance on his rival he finds his life spared by him 



when defenseless, foregoes his quest, enlists for Prince 
Charlie, and goes down with him to defeat and eventual 
death. Meanwhile the rival becomes a scholar, and in 
the fulness of time comes to his own. The book has 
the picturesqueness of narrative which is always Mrs. 
Barr's, avoids too great a tax upon the reader's nerves 
by impersonal narration of the more exciting episodes, 
and is rather out of the common. 

The late Frank R. Stockton left a posthumous story 
called " The Captain's Toil-Gate," which is now pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Appleton, and abundantly sus- 
tains its author's reputation for whimsical and quiet 
humor. The story is prefaced by a memoir from the 
graceful pen of Mrs. Stockton, a portrait of the author 
serving for the frontispiece of the volume. The nar- 
rative is fully characteristic of Stockton at his best, 
and it would be hard to imagine a better book so far as 
entertainment is concerned. 

American students of fiction will, for the most part, 
obtain their first knowledge of the late William Ed- 
wards Tirebuck from the memoir of him by Mr. Hall 
Caine which serves as a preface to his posthumous 
novel, " 'Twixt God and Mammon " (Appleton). The 
story is concerned with an English rector of ritualistic 
tendency, who falls in love with a pretty convert of his 
own making, a girl brought up in the Kirk of Scotland. 
The book shows a fine knowledge of the feminine and 
clerical mind, and brings out their kinship clearly in 
this particular instance. 

Another attempt toward making it impossible for 
those in a sheltered life to avoid a knowledge of the 
distress and woe of the less fortunate world is 
made in " The Story of an East Side Family " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), by Miss Lillian W. Betts. It is a 
book wholly different in treatment from such work as 
Mr. Arthur Morrison, for example, has done in Eng- 
land, having something of the ordered detail and com- 
prehensive following of life from infancy to old age 
which characterized the books of Zola. Some quarrel 
can be had with the tendency, discernible throughout 
the book, to anticipate events, the subsequent returns to 
orderly narrative being confusing. 

Of the fashion of a day long gone, "Retribution: A 
Tale of the Canadian Border " (Jennings & Pye), has 
been written by Rev. James B. Kenyon, known to 
many Americans through his volumes of graceful verse. 
Here Mr. Kenyon has been content to weave supersti- 
tion and an evident moral into a short narrative, not 
very well realized and astonishingly lacking in poetic 
quality. The tale concerns one family which in past 
generations has been able to raise itself upon the ruins 
of another. Remorse seizes one of the descendants of 
the prosperous house, and he turns the property back 
to its rightful owner. Through his improvidence the 
estate reverts to the descendant of the one who made 
restitution, and his daughter and the former owner's 
son fall in love. They are thwarted on every side, 
and the outcome is doubly tragical. 

Dr. James Ball Naylor has taken for the theme of 
" Under Mad Anthony's Banner " (Saalfield) the cam- 
paign made by the hero of Stony Point against the 
Indians and British during Washington's second ad- 
ministration, the book and the campaign culminating 
together in the effective victory at Fallen Timbers. The 
characters of the romance most in the eye of the reader 
are two scouts, and the one of the two who serves as hero 
is assigned the difficult part of being in love with two 
women at once. This complication the author treats 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



159 



with a naivete really astonishing, leaving the interest of 
his book almost wholly in the hair-breadth escapes of 
the scouts and the perfidy of one of Wayne's personal 
staff. The story is in no way remarkable, though it 
may serve to afford an occasional student of history a 
fair picture of the frontier life of the day. 

British imperialism comes near being reduced to an 
absurdity in Mr. Cutcliffe Hyne's "More Adventures 
of Captain Kettle: Captain Kettle K.C.B." (Federal 
Book Co.), as the title-page reads, curiously enough. As 
those who read the tales of which these are the sequel 
will recall, Captain Kettle was everything a Briton 
ought to be for the display of the finer national qualities 
in a serio-comic vein. He was not much to look at, it 
is true ; but this is probably only to prove that it is not 
looks, but deeds, that the Briton values. Here the 
small but indomitable master mariner and minister of 
the "Wharfedale Particular Methodists bears himself 
like a veritable Conquestador, rescuing strips of British 
Empire all over the world, conquering " inferior " races 
by a glance of his eye and a flourish of his revolver, 
taking possession of ships on the high seas without a 
suspicion of piracy, and exhibiting many more doughty 
deeds of dering-do. At the last, his death being sup- 
posed certain, he is knighted, characteristically enough. 

It is a conventional novel of the ultra-fashionable 
folk of New York that Mrs. Dore' Lyon has written in 
■ Prudence Pratt" (George V. Blackburne Co.), and it 
is rather more than ordinarily conventional. A young 
lawyer from the South, with a paltry income from his 
profession of S25,000 a year, has the audacity to fall in 
love with the daughter of a society leader who has 
ordered her into an engagement to marry a man worth 
810,000,000. It would be hard to conceive anything more 
obvious than the result certain to flow from such a situ- 
ation, — and it flows accordingly. Mrs. Lyon knows 
her people, and they are as conventional as the plot. 

"Until Seventy Times Seven" (Whittaker) is a moral 
story somewhat out of the common run, the work of an 
anonymous author. It deals with the life of an Episco- 
palian clergyman whose wife has deserted him for the 
stage, a child being born to her several years after the 
separation. She comes back to him while he is the rector 
of a parish in one of the American smaller towns, be- 
lieving herself to be near death. But care brings her 
physical health again, her husband's manliness to moral 
regeneration, and the book ends happily. It is a daring 
theme, but one well carried off on the spiritual if not on 
the literary side. 



Briefs ox Xew Books. 



An entertaining In selecting Mr. G. K. Chesterton 
book about to prepare the volume on Robert 

Browning. Browning for the series of « English 

Men of Letters " (Macmillan), the editor was doubt- 
less aware that the resulting book would be any- 
thing but humdrum, and may very reasonably have 
entertained some misgivings as to the experiment. 
For Mr. Chesterton is a young writer who is chiefly 
characterized by unexpectedness, and is determined 
to be original at all costs. He has certainly pro- 
duced an entertaining book, and a book which is, on 
the whole, reasonable in its conclusions, although 
these are often stated in somewhat startling terms. 
Mr. Chesterton's chief literary affectation is para- 



dox, as when he says that " Browning's love-poetry 
is the finest love-poetry in the world, because it 
does not talk about raptures, and ideals, and gates 
of heaven, but about window-panes, and gloves, and 
garden walls," or when he calmly remarks, a pro- 
pos of the elopement with Elizabeth Barrett, that 
" he had always had the courage to tell the truth ; 
and now it was demanded of him to have the greater 
courage to tell a lie, and he told it with perfect 
cheerfulness and lucidity." This sort of cleverness, 
and the other sort that finds expression in such in- 
cidental observations as "Paul founded a civiliza- 
tion by keeping an ethical diary," is apt to pall 
upon the reader who discovers it upon every page ; 
but such is Mr. Chesterton's way, and the defects 
of his qualities must be forgiven for the sake of the 
qualities themselves, which are freshness of mind, 
keenness of penetiation, and freedom from the ob- 
vious clichks of criticism. The author strains his 
points now and then, as when, speaking of the po- 
et's last hour with his wife, he goes on to say : 
"He, closing the door of that room behind him, 
closed a door in himself, and none ever saw Brown- 
ing upon earth again, but only a splendid surface." 
This comes dangerously near to being nonsense. 
The materials for a study of Browning are so eas- 
ily brought together that there has been no ques- 
tion of research in this work. There are the letters, 
and there is Mrs. Orr's biography, and there are 
the poems. The Browning Society has brought 
out a few facts of its own, and many anecdotes are 
current in books of literary gossip. These are Mr. 
Chesterton's sources ; the rest he has evolved from 
his imagination. Speaking of the cryptic titles of 
the later poems, he tells of " a lady I once knew 
who had merely read the title of • Pacchiarotto and 
How He "Worked in Distemper,' and thought that 
Pacchiarotto was the name of a dog, whom no at- 
tacks of canine disease could keep from the fulfilment 
of his duty." We must be pardoned for entertain- 
ing a dark suspicion that this lady is a myth. Mr. 
Chesterton has a good deal to say about Browning's 
alleged obscurity, and the upshot of it all is about 
what Mr. Swinburne has said in discussing the 
same subject. Browning's vision was lightning-like 
in its swiftness of action and sharpness of revela- 
tion, and he did not think it necessary to help men 
of duller and slower vision to see all that he did; 
or, rather, he could not comprehend how much 
duller and slower of vision the ordinary run of mor- 
tals are. As our author puts it, "Sordello" was 
" the most glorious compliment that has ever been 
paid to the average man." 

The title to Professor Gerard Bald- 
archuectu™ w * n Brown's two handsome octavo 

volumes on " The Arts in Early En- 
gland " (Dutton) is likely to be misleading to one 
who is seeking information in the history of art as 
that term is generally accepted. And the selection 
of that title is scarcely explained by the sub-titles 
to the two volumes respectively, — "The Life of

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Saxon England in its Relation to the Arts " and 
" Ecclesiastical Architecture in England from the 
Conversion of the Saxons to the Norman Conquest." 
These sub-titles, however, show the relation of one 
of the volumes to the other and of both to an earlier 
work, — "From Schola to Cathedral, a Study of 
Early Christian Architecture and its Relation to the 
Life of the Church," published a few years after the 
appointment of the author to the Watson-Gordon 
Professorship of Fine Art in the University of 
Edinburgh. The author finds the art of the Mid- 
dle Ages to a large extent centred in architecture. 
There were, indeed, in those days, forms of art 
which were not directly connected with the con- 
structive art, yet architecture is clearly marked out 
as the predominant Mediaeval craft ; and therein 
Professor Brown finds his justification for regard- 
ing his dissertation upon architecture as inclusive 
of all the arts of Saxon England. To a proper 
study of the architectural monuments of the period 
under consideration, — castles, churches, and mon- 
asteries, — a knowledge of some of the facts of the 
religious and social life of the Saxons in England 
is necessary. It is to a discussion of these economic 
conditions of Saxon England that Professor Brown 
devotes the first of the volumes before us. He 
draws his material more largely from the Venerable 
Bede's " Historia Ecclesiastica " than from any 
other source. How thoroughly he pursues his in- 
quiries might be illustrated by his discussion of the 
" Ing Theory," for example, — that is, that En- 
glish place-names terminating in " ing " or " inge " 
imply an original settlement by an individual and 
not by a body of kinsfolk ; a theory which Professor 
Brown does not hold as of unquestioned ortho- 
doxy. The Country and the Town of a thousand 
years ago, the Monastic seats, and the Village 
Church in its varied relations, are all similarly 
discussed in a manner deeply interesting to the 
antiquary, the archaeologist, and the historian, as 
well as to the art student. The second volume 
contains a descriptive survey of the Saxon build- 
ings in England, and is a careful recension of a 
series of articles which have appeared in a prom- 
inent architectural journal in England. As a sur- 
vey, it is a fairly wide one, embracing examples 
from all periods and from all parts of the country. 
As a contribution to the architectural history of 
England, it is all the more valuable because of the 
discussions of economic questions in the preceding 
volume. The illustrations are for the most part 
original sketches drawn from the author's measure- 
ments. Maps and an index list of Saxon buildings 
render valuable assistance to those who would seek 
to investigate the subject further. 

The success of the series of lectures 
at Concord and Boston, celebrating 
the Emerson centenary during the 
last two weeks of July, was largely due to the zeal 
and practical devotion of a few promoters, among 
whom Mr. Edwin D. Mead merits special mention. 



A memorial of 
the Emerson 
Centenary. 



It seems fitting, therefore, that a memorial volume 
should issue from his pen, and record in more per- 
manent form his personal aim "to prompt young 
men and women to such new companionship with 
Emerson as shall give them a larger portion of his 
idealism and lofty spirit in religion and philosophy 
and in the service of mankind." The three essays 
now brought together in the volume entitled "The 
Influence of Emerson " are compiled from various 
public addresses, and have less of the evident pur- 
pose to be " timely " than has characterized much 
of the Emersonian criticism of the last few months. 
We find here frequent reiteration of familiar truths, 
yet there are passages of such deep feeling and 
personal revelation that the reader gains a new zest 
from the volume. The first chapter deals with 
" The Philosophy of Emerson," carefully choosing 
the term Idealist in preference to that of Tran- 
scendentalism and differentiating his Idealism from 
that of the great German philosophers. " Nature," 
as the utterance of the poet and the thinker, was 
" full of Darwinism." Of Emerson's ethics and their 
relation to Kant's principles, the author says : " The 
three cardinal doctrines of the Kritik of Practical 
Reason never received such powerful summary 
statement as in Emerson's famous lines : 
1 So nigh is grandeur to our dust, 

So near is God to man, 
When Duty whispers low, Thou must, 

The youth replies, I can.' " 

In the second essay, "Emerson and Theodore Par- 
ker," Mr. Mead has touched with a broad pen upon 
the correlation of the two men in religious teaching 
and their joint service for liberal theology and a 
reasonable faith. The third paper outlines with 
detailed vividness the personal relations between 
Emerson and Carlyle. Without any expanded study 
of the two men in their intellectual or literary as- 
pects, Mr. Mead has given an interesting review of 
the circumstances which began and continued this 
rare friendship of souls. Their differences of tem- 
perament, training, and social relations are well 
defined; yet the bonds of unity are strongly pro- 
claimed and illustrated. Allied in friendship and 
aim, unlike in methods and direct influence, the 
two names will ever be linked " as awakeners and 
inspirers, as preachers of self-reliance and individ- 
ualism against the compliance, superstitions, gre- 
gariousness, and sham that were rusting out the 
world ; as prophets of the soul, eternity, and God, 
the universal miracle, against agnosticism, mechan- 
ical philosophy, and a utilitarian morality." 

A volume by Mr. Wirt Gerrare en- 
nZ^Hca. titled "Greater Russia" (Macmillan) 

embodies the results of personal im- 
pressions received in the course of a slow journey 
of investigation throughout Russia and Siberia in 
1901. In making his observations the author has 
cared less for political questions or governmental 
institutions than for actual industrial opportunities 
and the extent to which these have been grasped.

Petty official annoyances are, indeed, noted, bat 
more as an evidence of the inability of the Russian 
citizen to exist without paternalistic government 
than as in themselves an essential evil. For it is 
in this dependence upon the state that Mr. Gerrare 
finds the chief lack of similarity between America 
and Russia, which Russians themselves, he tells us, 
are fond of calling the "New America." His esti- 
mate of the justice of the comparison is decidedly 
adverse. " Physically, Russia may resemble Amer- 
ica ; it may have a similar climate and equal nat- 
ural advantages, but unless the Russian people 
possess certain qualities the Americans have, they 
will not make any 'New America' of any part of 
the empire. The difference is immense. In the 
United States of America the state is the servant 
of the public ; in Russia every individual is a ser- 
vant of the state. In America a number of individ- 
uals combine for a certain purpose, and the state 
confirms or legalizes their action. In Russia, it is 
the state that initiates, the state that achieves, and 
the state that looks to the public for approbation. 
It is the state that leads, guides, and pushes the 
public in the way it intends they should take." 
The greater portion of Mr. Gerrare's work is, how- 
ever, devoted to a careful analysis, very nearly a 
census, of industrial conditions in Siberia, involving 
detailed explanations of the exact stage of develop- 
ment of railways, mines, roads, markets, agriculture, 
and trade, in each district traversed, together with 
an impartial opinion on the probable rapidity of, 
and opportunity for, future advancement. The in- 
evitable dulness of a semi-statistical compilation is 
largely relieved by shrewd characterizations of men 
and peoples, which, in conjunction with incidents 
illustrative of customs and habits, furnish the me- 
dium by which the author passes on to the reader 
his own fund of exact information. Still, it is in 
the very exactness of his information and the evi- 
dent impartiality of his judgments that Mr. Ger- 
rare's volume is distinctly a valuable addition to 
our literature on contemporary Russia. The work 
is profusely and excellently illustrated. 

Some new "The Correspondence of Lady 

letter* 0/ Burghersh with the Duke of Wel- 

WeUingum. lington," edited by her daughter, 

has recently been published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
& Co. There are a photogravure portrait of Lady 
Burghersh and three excellent ones of the Duke, 
one of which, a back view, from a water-color 
sketch by C R. Leslie, is reproduced in color on the 
cover, making a unique decoration. The portraits 
acquire fresh interest after the letters have been 
read, with their frequent references to the nuisance 
of being " the slave of these great artists," who 
were always clamoring for sittings, and whom the 
Duke had grdmblingly to endure because all the 
world and its monarchs insisted upon being given 
his portrait. Most of the letters included in this 
collection are from the Duke to Lady Burghersh, 
who was his niece and the wife of a favorite aide ; 



but there are a few to Lord Burghersh, and a few 
more from Lady Burghersh to the Duke or her 
husband. Altogether, they are meant to show the 
Duke as he was to his friends and family : a man 
to be loved, as well as a military genius. Some of 
the letters are as baiting and repetitious as Wel- 
lington's speeches. Others are terse, coldly formal. 
and full of matter, like the famous despatches ; bat 
occasionally they become confidential, humorous. 
and very entertaining, like the letters to Lady de 
Ros. We find in them discussions of military af- 
fairs and politics, in which Lady Burghersh took a 
keen and intelligent interest ; many references to 
the number of tiresome people he must entertain, 
and the countless matters he must attend to "be- 
cause no one else will," and to the multitude of let- 
ters he received " which might as well have been 
written to any body else." Only, as the Duke pat 
it. " That which people will not understand is that 
the whole labour and business and ceremony and 
everything else of the world cannot be thrown upon 
one man, and that an old one ! " Yet he never 
flinched from the responsibilities that were thrust 
upon him, and he had time enough left to do all in 
his power for the comfort and pleasure of Lady 
Burghersh and her children. He was continually 
asking them to Walmer Castle, — in the warmth 
of whose rooms he took a pride that sometimes 
threatened to suffocate his guests, — and on the 
day of his death he had made all preparations to 
meet her at Dover and speed her on her journey to 
the Continent. The letters are not models of the 
epistolary art. They reveal nothing but the kind 
heart and unselfish thoughtfulness of a great gen- 
eral and statesman. It is as setting forth this rather 
neglected side of Wellington's character that they 
make their claim to attention.

For although it does not claim to be scientific, it 
is closely allied to science, being the first of its 
class, as far as we know, based upon or definitely 
recognizing a regional adaptation of foods. It is 
strange, as is pointed out in the preface to this 
book, that people should wish to eat in Labrador 
or in the tropics the same food they eat at home. 
An Indian tribe in any country, it is said, has 
more dietary sense than the most intellectual vis- 
itor. By the slow gravitation of common-sense, k 
has arrived at the food rigime best adapted to its 
environment, and that without medical conventions, 
chemical analyses, health-foods, or "faked" coffees. 
A New Englander goes to Panama and calls for 
beans and beefsteak, or in Alaska eats his roller- 
process bread and fruit ; but the dish-faced abo-

he invariably does better, without the wear and 
tear of knowing. This book radiates attractiveness,.

from the significant string of peppers on its cover, 
through its pages of half-tone pictures of the Cali- 
fornia missions in whose interest it is published, to 
the body of the volume. With signed recipes from 
everywhere, its specialty is Spanish- American cook- 
ery, and its masterpieces are famous dishes of Old 
California, Mexico, and Peru. The fact that Mr. 
Charles F. Lummis contributes an introductory ar- 
ticle on Spanish-American cookery vouches for its 
accuracy as well as for its charm. He also gives 
recipes for many historic dishes of those southern 
lands which have held a large portion of his life 
and of his heart, and his section of this book is the 
only place known to us where one can get English 
cooking directions for real Spanish dishes. Every 
American has reason to thank the Landmarks Club 
for its efforts to preserve the most interesting of 
the historic remains of Southern California. It has 
worked under expert supervision, and the reports 
of what it has accomplished with little money are 
most interesting. The compilation of this book has 
been a labor of love on the part of the club, and the 
proceeds of its sale will go to the further work of 
restoration of the now faat decaying yet still beau- 
tiful mission buildings. The book is published by

Professor William Cranston Law- 
ton's " Introduction to Greek Clas- 
sical Literature " ( Scribner ) is the 
latest addition to the list of manuals of the subject 
prepared primarily for teaching purposes, but not 
without attraction for the general reader. Mr. Law- 
ton's book has an unusual measure of this attractive 
quality, for he is a much-practiced writer, and has 
acquired a method of expression which makes its 
points strikingly yet with a surprising economy of 
words. He is not as successful in making his mean- 
ing clear, as may be illustrated by the following 
sentences, which would be sure to lead a beginner 
into sad misconceptions: "Herodotos, Plato, Plu- 
tarch, the tragic three, are . . . indispensable." "In- 
vestigations no less fruitful are now in progress in 
various parts of the iEgean, notably in Crete, and 
in Cyprus." Imagine the feelings of the teacher 
who is informed, with our author as authority, that 
Crete is in the iEgean, and that Herodotos, Plato, 
and Plutarch are commonly spoken of as "the tragic 
three " ! Mr. Lawton's book is divided into a large 
number of brief chapters, and many of these into 
still briefer sections, treating of individual authors. 
The chapters include such special topics as "The 
Mythic World," "Homeric Problems," "Beginnings 
of Greek Music," and "Greek Athletics." The 
treatment of authors is perforce very brief, but such 
men as Aristotle and Lucian surely deserve more 
than the few skimpy comments that are accorded 
them. Mr. Lawton is up to date in his use of the 
results of recent discoveries — Herondas, Bacchy- 
lides, Greek music, and the Constitution of Athens 
— although the Timotheos find seems to have been 
just too late to get mentioned. We find Timotheos 



in the index, but the page referred to contains no 
word to bear out the reference. The author is most 
nearly adequate in his treatment of the poets, but 
is a little too fond of experiment in hexameter 
translation. The book is supplied with chronolog- 
ical tables and brief bibliographical paragraphs, 
chiefly indicating English studies and translations. 
A score of well-selected full-page illustrations — an- 
cient sculpture, Pompeian wall-paintings, Flaxman 
drawings, and modern imaginative works — add 
greatly to the interest of the volume.

Watteau and . . » . , #» j j 

Ms followers. pictures one frequently finds draw- 
ings, decorative porcelain, etc., said 
to be the work of Watteau, but not infrequently 
the productions of his followers and imitators. In 
"Watteau and his School" (Macmillan), Mr. 
Edgcumbe Staley has thrown some light on the 
little-known personality of the creator of this par- 
ticular school of art, as well as interesting informa- 
tion on his numerous followers. Jean Antoine 
Watteau was born at Valenciennes on October 10, 
1684, and the streets of Valenciennes were the 
cradle of his inspiration. He arrived at an early 
age in Paris, where his inspiration knew little 
bounds. The gay crowds in the gardens, the fasci- 
nating chanteuses of the opera, the animated groups 
in the streets, the elegant equipages and their 
courtly occupants, were to him so many tableaux 
vivants. Delicacy of touch and minute attention 
to detail gained for him the distinction of being the 
most brilliant and original draughtsman of the 
eighteenth century. The present biographer claims 
that no designer ever equalled him in piquancy of 
pencilling. Watteau's rank and title in the world 
of art was " Maistre-peintre des Fetes Galantes " 
— the exact meaning of which in our more re- 
strained vocabulary is difficult to give. He died 
July 18, 1721. Considering the scarcity of infor- 
mation, Mr. Staley has given us a very readable 
biography. The illustrations consist of reproduc- 
tions of numerous paintings by the artist discussed.

The S. G. Rains Co., New York, are the publishers 
■of a reprint of Fitzhugh Ludlow's " The Hasheesh 
Eater," now nearly half a century old, and long out of 
print. 

A new edition, with the colored illustrations by Row- 
landson, of " The History of Johnny Quae Genus," a con- 
tinuation of " Doctor Syntax," is reprinted from the 
edition of 1822 by the Messrs. Appleton. 

" The Motor Book," by Mr. R. J. Mecredy, and " The 
Tree Book," by Miss Mary Rowles Jarvis, are two new 
volumes in Mr. John Lane's series called " The Country 
Handbooks," edited by Mr. Harry Roberts. 

" Shakespeare's Garden," by Mr. J. Harvey Bloom 
(appropriate name!), is a little book of Elizabethan 
natural history and folk-lore, cast in the form of a cal- 
endar, and full of matter both curious and interesting. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. publish an illustrated 
popular edition of Mr. Kipling's " The Light that 
Failed," with scenes from the dramatic representation 
of the story by Mr. Forbes Robertson and Miss Ger- 
trude Elliott. 

"The New Library of Poetry and Song," compiled 
by William Cullen Bryant, will be issued this Fall in 
a one-volume edition by the Baker & Taylor Co. The 
work was revised in 1901, and many new plates and 
poems added at that time. 

The Fleming H. Revell Co. publish " The Student's 
Complete Text-Book " of Esperanto, the new universal 
language which is the latest successor to Volapiik 'in 
curious linguistic interest. Mr. J. C. O'Connor is the 
compiler of the little volume. 

Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. will publish at an 
early date a volume on "The Life and Work of Moses 
Homan Bixby," by Mrs. Jennie Bixby Johnson ; "An 
Introductory Arithmetic," by Messrs. David M. Sen- 
senig and Robert F. Anderson; and a "Song Year

The novelty of Mr. Frank M. Chapman's " Color 
Key to North American Birds," to be published this 
month by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co., is a new 
sort of colored picture of each of the birds on the mar- 
gin opposite the description on every page, showing in 
a conspicuous way the significant characteristics so that 
they will be easily recognized on the birds themselves. 

" Venice and its Story," announced by the Macmil- 
lan Co., will be one of the most elaborately-illustrated 
of the autumn books. The text is by Mr. Thomas 
Okey, joint author with Mr. Bolton King of a recent 
history of modern Italy. The illustrations include 
fifty-two colored plates by Mr. O. F. M. Ward, and 
fifty full-page line drawings by Miss Nelly Erichsen. 

W. M. Thackeray's acquaintance with the Baxter 
family of New York was one of the most interesting 
of the great novelist's friendships. His letters to the 
Baxters are to see the light in the pages of " The Cen- 
tury " during the coming year. They cover both visits 
of Thackeray to America, and they reflect his opinions 
upon all sorts and kinds of American topics, with all 
the author's frankness, vivacity, and charm. 

Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed, a Boston publisher, and 
Mr. D. B. Updike of the Merrymount Press, are pro- 
posing to re-issue the novels of Jane Austen in a six- 



teen-volume " Merrymount " edition. It is planned in 
this edition to return to the general form in which Miss 
Austen's novels were originally published, issuing the 
longer novels in three volumes and the shorter stories 
in two volumes each. The print will be large and 
readable, the paper light, and the volumes of conveni- 
ent size. It is to be hoped that all lovers of Jane 
Austen will lend this interesting project their support. 

Canon Ainger's Life of Crabbe will be the next 
volume to appear in the " English Men of Letters " 
series. The Macmillan Co. announce for publication 
this Fall in the same series a biography of Lowell, by 
Dr. Henry van Dyke, and Mr. H. C. Beeching's Life 
of Jane Austen. A little later there will be Owen 
Wister's Benjamin Franklin, Professor Woodberry's 
Emerson, and Sir Leslie Stephen's Hobbes. 

Under the general supervision of Mr. George French 
a well-known writer on subjects connected with artis- 
tic printing, The Imperial Press of Cleveland will 
undertake the production of choice books in limited 
editions. The first volume to be issued will be a 
treatise by Mr. French on "Printing in Relation to 
Graphic Art." Mr. Andrew Andrews and Mr. Louis 
H. Kinder, formerly of the Roycroft Shop, will be 
associated with Mr. French in his new work. 

The list of books announced for Fall publication by 
the American Unitarian Association comprises "The 
Call of the Twentieth Century," by Dr. David Starr 
Jordan; "The Principles of the Founders," by Mr. 
Edwin D. Mead; "Out of Nazareth," by Rev. Minot 
J. Savage; "The Understanding Heart," by Mr. 
Samuel M. Crothers; and " Apples of Gold," an anthol- 
ogy compiled by Miss Clara Bancroft Beatley. All of 
these books will be issued during the present month. 

Baedeker's "The Rhine," in its fifteenth revision, has 
just been imported for the American market by the 
Messrs. Scribner, from whom we have at the same time 
" Berlin and its Environs," a small Baedeker extracted 
mainly from the " Northern Germany," and now pub- 
lished for the first time in English in this separate form. 
London, Paris, and Berlin are the only cities thus far 
made the subjects of separate volumes in the Baedeker 
list. Rome should come next, and Vienna, and then 
perhaps New York. 

Professor George M. Wrong, a Canadian scholar, has 
prepared a school history of « The British Nation " for 
the "Twentieth Century" series of text-books pub- 
lished by the Messrs. Appleton. It is a thorough and 
well-written book, with many illustrations, and gives 
adequate attention to the social aspect of English his- 
tory, as well as to the biographies of historical charac- 
ters. Mechanically, the book is an exact counterpart 
of Professor McLaughlin's "The American Nation" 
in the same series. 

The " American Citizen Series," published by Messrs. 
Longmans, Green, & Co., has just been enriched by a 
treatise on "Actual Government as Applied under 
American Conditions," the work of Professor Albert 
Bushnell Hart. The book is intended as a text for high- 
school and college use, and seems to us to fulfil its pur- 
pose better than any other existing treatise, with the 
possible exception of Mr. Ashley's recent work. It is a 
well-balanced production, with its facts brought down to 
date, and is written in a style singularly attractive, con- 
sidering the difficulty of getting so great a mass of mat- 
ter within the limits of a six-hundred page volume. We 
recommend it heartily to teachers and school authorities.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



THE STORY OF A BOOK. 



IN THREE CHAPTERS. 



Chapter I. The Men Who Made It. 

ONE hundred years ago Noah Webster — 
journalist, scholar, patriot — was brooding 
a great undertaking. He had worked with Jay 
and Hamilton for the adoption of the Consti- 
tution and the support of Washington's admin- 
istration ; freedom and order were established ; 
now for a science and literature worthy of the 
young republic! At the foundation of all is 
language. Webster had already made a Speller 
which speedily became and long remained a 
text- book for the entire people, training to uni- 
formity of spelling and pronunciation, and 
yielding the author a maintenance which en- 
abled him to carry on the vast and uncompen- 
sated work of " An American Dictionary of 
the English Language." In the exposition of 
that language no real advance had been made 
since Johnson's dictionary sixty years before. 
The new age and the new country had pro- 
duced a flood of new words and usages for 
which there was no interpreter or arbiter. 
Webster essayed to cover the whole literature 
and the living use of the English-speaking 
race, with special inclusion of the new nation- 
ality. He brought to the task a natural genius 
for language, a special aptitude for lucid, ex- 
act, and terse definition, a ripe scholarship, and 
a tireless industry. With his work well begun, 
he stopped to broaden his knowledge, and 
mastered the main vocabularies of twenty lan- 
guages. He studied for a year in Europe. 
Johnson worked intermittently for eight years 
on his dictionary ; Webster spent twenty years 
on his. He gave it to the world in 1828 — a 
splendid monument of scholarship, and in its 
substance fitted to every-day needs. But it was 
in two bulky volumes, its price was $20, it con- 
tained a few eccentricities of spelling, and the 
American public was not yet emancipated from 
deference to English authority. The first edi- 
tion of 2600 copies was enough for thirteen 
years. Webster stood to his guns, bated no jot 
of his peculiarities even where most unpopular, 
revised the work on its original lines, and 
brought out a new edition, at $15, in 1841. 
That, too, found little sale; and in 1843 
Webster passed away, after a full and happy 
life, but with his magnum opus lying stranded 
like Robinson Crusoe's boat, a vessel too big 
for the builder to launch. 



One hundred years ago, to a country printer 
in Western Massachusetts was born his first son, 
George Merriam. The second son was Charles* 
and then came a flock of brothers and sisters. 
The boys were educated in the district school 
and the printing office ; they toiled early and 
late ; when their father died they gave their 
slender patrimony to their mother and sisters, 
and pushed their own way; and in 1831 
G. & C. Merriam began business as retail 
booksellers in Springfield, Mass. They gave 
to business every hour not given to their fam- 
ilies or their church. They began publishing 
in a modest way, notably an admirable series 
of school readers — the " Child's Guide," 
"Village Reader," etc. — compiled by the 
elder brother. When, at Dr. Webster's death, 
his book came into the market, they discerned 
something of its potential value, and bought the 
unsold edition and the publishing right. That 
purchase marked an alliance of business and 
scholarship which has borne fruit for sixty 
years. The new publishers' first care was to 
fit the scholar's wares to the public's want. 
They employed Professor Chauncey A. Good- 
rich, Webster's son-in-law and literary heir, 
to re-edit the book ; the eccentric spellings 
were dropped and the reasonable changes re- 
tained ; such scientists as Silliman and Dana 
were employed as contributors; and in 1847 
the full work was brought out in one volume 
for $6. The public favor was instantly won 
and never was lost. Webster's executors had 
appraised the copyright for the unexpired ten 
years at $3000, and the Merriams bought it for 
that. They so increased its value that when 
the copyright was renewed for fourteen years 
they made terms with the Webster family by 
which during that period they paid to them, for 
the large book with its Abridgments and the 
Speller, a quarter of a million dollars. The 
Merriams leased the Abridgments and the 
Speller to other houses, and concentrated their 
whole energy on the large book. 

In 1850 it was proposed in the Massachu- 
setts legislature, unsuggested by the publishers, 
that a copy of Webster's large dictionary be 
placed in every district school. Before the leg- 
islative committee the advocate of a rival book 
sneered at Webster as an ignorant pretender. 
Professor Noah Porter of Yale College replied 
with so eloquent a vindication of Webster's 
scholarship and services that local prejudice 
was conquered. The schools were offered their 
choice, and 3035 took Webster and 105 its 
competitor. Soon after, New York state placed 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

10,000 copies of Webster in its schools, and 
thus began its acceptance as a school standard 
which to-day extends over the entire country. 

When the enlargement of Worcester to an 
illustrated quarto was announced in 1859, the 
Webster publishers made a prompt counter- 
stroke. They put into a supplement a large num- 
ber of classified illustrations — a new feature in 
an American dictionary — added a supplement 
of new words which had long been accumulat- 
ing ; appended a valuable table of synonyms 
by Professor Goodrich ; and brought out their 
enlarged work well in advance of the new Wor- 
cester, which never approached it in popularity. 

Then they set to work on a radical and 
thorough revision. Under Dr. Porter's super- 
vision, with the aid of a group of eminent 
scholars, the advances in linguistic science 
and in popular usage were inwrought with 
Webster's solid groundwork. The period of 
this revision was that of the Civil War ; busi- 
ness fell off ; the Southern market was lost ; 
the income from the Speller was intermitted, 
and payments to the Webster family were by 
amicable arrangement postponed ; war taxes 
were heavy ; but the three brothers (Homer 
Merriam being now included) pushed steadily 
the revision, while they supported the war, and 
looked for the return of peace and prosperity. 
So came to birth the great book of 1864, 
known familiarly as "The Unabridged"; its 
predecessor being completely superseded and 
withdrawn from the market, until revamped 
and foisted upon the public under false pre- 
tenses half a century later. 

A battle of pamphlets turning largely on 
the question of spellings ; the general prev- 
alence of the Websterian practice, and an 
eclipse of all rivalry in the commercial field ; 
a fresh supplement of new words in 1879 ; the 
gradual addition of biographical and geograph- 
ical tables — these were incidents preliminary 
to the next great revision. To this revision — 
a work covering ten years and costing over a 
third of a million of dollars — were given the 
fuller elaboration, the larger permanent staff, 
the freer employment of specialists, and the 
exact attention to every detail, which accord 
with the advanced methods of modern scholar- 
ship and business. In a work carried on thus 
through generations, there has developed a 
special art of dictionary-making, with an inval- 
uable tradition of experience, yet progressive 
and always expanding to meet the new con- 
ditions. The result appeared in 1890 in a 
work whose title marked the supremacy won 



throughout the English-speaking world, Web- 
ster's International Dictionary. 

Its improvement has never ceased for a day. 
New matter has been added ; tables have been 
scrupulously brought up to date ; the accumu- 
lation and sifting of new words and meanings 
has gone steadily on. A Supplement of new 
words in 1900 ; tables of biography and geog- 
raphy substantially made over in 1902 ; a 
steady accession of improvements with no spe- 
cial announcement — this has been the later 
history of the book. To the chief editorship 
so long and ably filled by President Porter 
has succeeded Dr. W. T. Harris, United States 
Commissioner of Education and a scholar of 
world-wide repute. 

It is to the alliance of scholarship and busi- 
ness sagacity that Webster has owed its success 
and growth. From that alliance has sprung a 
harmonious aim and a comprehensive plan of 
work. Before setting forth that ideal, a word 
more may be given to the personnel of the 
combination, past and present. On the pub- 
lishers' side the force was strengthened in 1877 
by the addition of Mr. O. M. Baker, trained as 
an educator and a school superintendent ; an 
experienced and able bookseller, Mr. H. C. 
Rowley, came in two years later ; the change 
by incorporation to " The G. & C. Merriam 
Company " in 1892 was a change of form only, 
the same hands still manning the ship ; to the 
directors was added Mr. K. N. Washburn, who 
had been long engaged in the company's serv- 
ice ; and while the first two Merriam brothers 
have passed away, the directorship includes two 
of the family name and Homer Merriam still 
presides in a hale old age. 

At the head of the editorial force have been 
in succession three scholars of high repute ; 
Dr. Goodrich, the heir of Dr. Webster in 
mental acumen ; President Porter, with a rare 
combination of original intellect, acquired 
knowledge, and practical sagacity ; and Dr. 
Harris, officially the first man in the Amer- 
ican educational world, and eminent in a wide 
variety of studies. Next to these have been a 
group of contributors of the highest standing 
in general scholarship or special branches, 
such as Dr.Mahnof Germany, Professor W. D. 
Whitney, President D. C. Gilman, Professors 
Hadley, Lounsbury, Sheldon, Remsen, Verrill, 
Justice Brewer — the list could be indefinitely 
prolonged. Of highest practical service have 
been men perhaps less famous who have through 
arduous years perfected themselves in the tech- 
nical art of dictionary-making ; as chiefs of

and, among the living, F. Sturges Allen. With 
these have been scores of faithful and service- 
able workers, whose lot has been " to widen 
knowledge and escape the praise." 

So much for the men who have made the 
book ; the ideals they have followed and the 
methods they have used will be given in the 
next issue of The Dial.

on the Northern side, were written by General Gordon from time to time throughout a great number of years. They 
are not, therefore, a made -to-order book, bat the spontaneous recollections of a very full life. This is not a narrative 
history of the war, but records, with anecdote, incident, and with eloquence, the personal experiences of General 
Gordon and the eminent leaders who were his near friends. No other such intimately personal record has been 
produced by either side. Every chapter contains humorous incidents and often pathetic ones, which will pass into 
the permanent history of the war.

Two Important Historical Books 

JUST PUBLISHED 

Talks of Napoleon at St. Helena 

With General Baron Gourgaud 

Together with the Journal kept by Gourgaud on their Journey from Waterloo to St. Helena 
Translated, and with Notes 

By Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer 

Author of "France in the Nineteenth Century," etc. 
Gourgaud' s famous Journal has never been translated into English, and this need has 
been keenly felt by students of Napoleon, especially since the appearance of Lord 
Rosebery's "Napoleon: The Last Phase." In this admirable work the author says: 
"The one capital and supreme record of life at St. Helena is 
the private journal of General Gourgaud.'''' 
This journal is too prolix for complete translation, so that Mrs. Latimer has 
extracted from the two volumes almost all that Napoleon said to Gourgaud in 
familiar chats about his past life, and his speculations as to the future. She has 
omitted much that she considered irrelevant from the standpoint of the general 
reader, and the result is a book fairly crowded with interest from beginning to 
end. Mrs. Latimer has always excelled in the faculty of picking out essentials, 
and nowhere has this characteristic been more pronounced than in her arrangement 
of the "Talks of Napoleon."

Famous Assassinations of History 

By Francis Johnson 

No more interesting presentation of Mr. Johnson's remarkable book can be 
made than to give the list of the famous personages whose violent deaths have had, 
in his consideration, a notable effect on the world's history. A chapter is given 
to each event, and the author telis the story with a wealth of language and imag- 
ination that brings these stirring scenes before the reader in a manner equalled by 
few previous historical works. 

These are the famous men and women whose assassinations have had a far- 
reaching effect and influence on posterity: 

Philip of Macedon Rizzio and Darnley Jean Paul Marat 

Tiberius Gracchus William of Orange Paul I. of Russia 

Julius Caesar Ivan the Terrible August von Kotzebue

PUBLISHED OCTOBER 9, WITH PORTRAITS 



Mr. JOHN MORLEY'S Life of 

WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE 

Three Illustrated Volumes, Cloth, Octavo, $10.50 net. 

" Whoever follows the annals of England during the memorable years from 1843 t0 J $94 
will meet Gladstone's name on almost every page, will feel how great must have 
been the force of an intellect that could so interpenetrate the story of its time, and 
will seek to know something of the dauntless figure that rose always conspicuous 
above the struggling throng. . . . When he departed the light seemed to have 
died out of the sky." — James Bryce. 

Mr. MORLEY'S is undoubtedly the most thorough and important life of Mr. 
GLADSTONE that will be written. The author is Mr. GLADSTONE'S 

literary executor and has in his possession all his subject's private papers and docu- 
ments. He has likewise had at his disposal all desirable public documents, through 
his recent connection with the English Government, and no other man was so 
intimately associated with Mr. GLADSTONE in politics and public affairs 
throughout the whole of his active life. 

To a considerable extent the three volumes form a history of England throughout 
the majority of the great Victorian era; indeed, the sharpest of all the many 
difficulties of his task, the author says, has been to draw the line between history 
and biography — between the fortunes of the community and the exploits, thoughts, 
and purposes of the individual who had so marked a share in them. 



11 Gladstone was a man of such a mould and fibre, and of such a transcendent career, that 
no one has since arisen to take the place which he unquestionably held at his 
death — that of ' the world's greatest citizen.' " — New York Evening Post.

THE HAPPY FEW. 



Those who have read (and we are sorry for 
those who have not read) the masterpiece of 
the great French novelist who wrote under the 
pen-name of Stendhal, and who, in a moment 
of piqne, directed that he should be described 
upon his tombstone as " Arrigo Beyle, Milan- 
ese," will remember those enigmatic words, 
"To the Happy Few," which are appended to 
the last page of the French text. Although 
standing in the place of the usual " Fin," they 
seem to be meant as a sort of dedication — 
perhaps to the intellectual aristocracy of readers 
to whom alone the work could make its full 
appeal. Certainly, the " few " who are capable 
of appreciating the descriptive charm and the 
psychological subtlety of this extraordinary 
composition are made " happy" in as legitimate 
a way as literature may warrant, and are likely 
to renew their enjoyment more than once at 
the same source. Not many works of fiction 
have the assured immortality of " La Chartreuse 
de Parme," and not many readers, unfortu- 
nately, acquire the refinement of appreciation 
which the work deserves. 

Among those readers, Mrs. Edith Wharton, 
whose delicate art has learned more than one 
lesson from Stendhal, must surely be reckoned. 
Her "Valley of Decision" was clearly a reflec- 
tion of the theme, and to some extent of the 
method, illustrated by the work in question. 
Even where it failed most noticeably, as it 
certainly did in the matter of vitality, to follow 
in Stendhal's footsteps, it still forced the com- 
parison upon the mind of the reader, who 
found on its every page a tribute, if not always 
conscious, to the source of its inspiration. We 
have been led to these retrospective observa- 
tions by a paper, contributed by Mrs. Wharton 
to the last number of "The North American 
Review," entitled "The Vice of Reading," 
which ends with the quotation of Stendhal's 
dedicatory words. Her interpretation of them 
coincides with the one which we have above 
suggested, and by their means she points a moral 
for writers and readers alike. She has been 
discussing the "mechanical reader " whose mind 
is too sluggish to react upon a book, and who 
gets from literature nothing worth having 
because he brings to it no personal element of 



250 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



value. And her conclusion runs as follows: 
"Obviously, it is to the writer that he is most 
harmful. The broad way which leads to his 
approval is so easy to tread and so thronged 
with prosperous fellow-travellers that many a 
young pilgrim has been drawn into it by the 
mere craving for companionship ; and perhaps 
it is not until the journey's end, when he reaches 
the Palace of Platitudes and sits down to a feast 
of indiscriminate praise, with the scribblers he 
has most despised helping themselves unre- 
proved out of the very dish prepared in his 
honor, that his thoughts turn longingly to that 
other way — the straight path leading * To the 
Happy Few.' " 

" To read well is an art, and an art that 
only the born reader can acquire," says Mrs. 
Wharton. This is her version of the Shake- 
spearian " to read and write comes by nature," 
aud the truth of the saying is one of many evi- 
dences of the wisdom inherent in the utterances 
of Dogberry, that much misunderstood philoso- 
pher, who has a message for the elect no less 
than for the groundling. To be a born reader, 
to use a book "as the keynote of unpremedi- 
tated harmonies, as the gateway into some 
paysage choisi of the spirit," is, no doubt, to 
be numbered with a smaller "remnant" of 
mankind than that which was the subject of 
Matthew Arnold's famous lecture. The "gen- 
tle reader," in Lamb's and FitzGerald's sense, 
is one of the rarest of birds, and the most art- 
ful mimicry of his habit and coloring will not 
enable an outsider to intrude upon the flock 
undetected. But we cannot all be gentle read- 
ers, since we were not all born that way, and 
it seems to us that Mrs. Wharton is rather 
hard on those whose flight is debarred from 
the sunny uplands of imagination, and whose 
natural limitations compel them to range upon 
lower levels and in grayer lights. And so, turn- 
ing from the joys attainable only by the Happy 
Few, we are constrained to say a word for the 
satisfactions that are still accessible to the Un- 
happy Many. 

" The mechanical reader " is the title given 
by Mrs. Wharton to the individual member 
of this numerous company. She says many 
severe things about him, which are, no doubt, 
in some measure justified. He is self-sufficient, 
he is " the slave of his book-mark," he thinks 
the books having the largest sales must be the 
books best worth reading, he is innocent of the 
art of judicious skipping, and, especially, he 
leels it his duty to express opinions. " Anyone 
who frequents a group of mechanical readers 



soon becomes accustomed to their socialistic 
use of certain formulas, and to the rapid pro- 
cess of erosion and distortion undergone by 
much-borrowed opinions." These are his sub- 
jective failings. Objectively, his influence is 
pernicious because he creates an enlarged de- 
mand for mediocre writing, he retards true 
culture by his appetite for popularizations of 
difficult matters, he confuses moral and intel- 
lectual judgments, and he misdirects the ten- 
dencies of criticism, producing " a creature in 
his own image — the mechanical critic" who 
makes precis- writing take the place of analysis. 
This is a heavy indictment, but does it warrant 
us in considering the case of the mechanical 
reader as hopeless, and in leaving him to wal- 
low in his Philistinism ? He may have a poor 
sort of soul, but is it not worth some effort to 
save, and is not his a case for the offices of 
the good Samaritan? Mrs. Wharton seems to 
think it is not, and to urge that with such per- 
sons the habit of reading is a vice to be erad- 
icated. 

The suggestion is enough to take away one's 
breath, especially when it leads to the con- 
demnation of all " reading deliberately under- 
taken," for no better reason than that the 
highest form of intercourse between reader 
and book is more often missed than hit by the 
mind that is seeking culture of set purpose. 
There can be no such thing as wise guidance in 
the choice of books, because, forsooth, no reader 
is worthy of a good book unless his unaided in- 
stinct leads him to it. Mr. Frederic Harrison 
would have something to say to this astonish- 
ing judgment. The conscientious persons " who 
make it a rule to read " are surely not de- 
serving of the scorn here heaped upon them, 
even if the books through which they plod their 
way " are not like growing things that strike 
root and intertwine branches, but like fossils 
ticketed and put away in the drawers of a geol- 
ogist's cabinet "; the superior critic may find 
their efforts amusing, but must be heartless in- 
deed not to see that they are also pathetic. 

Mrs. Wharton's view, if she really means it 
seriously, amounts to a flat condemnation of 
all the good advice given to aspiring readers 
by the wisest of counsellors, from Bacon to 
Buskin. It is a view the acceptance of which 
would paralyze the most fruitful modern edu- 
cational activities. If there is any one among 
recent educational developments more en- 
couraging than all the others, it is the increased 
attention given to the intelligent study of lit- 
erature, and the success with which thousands

of persons, young and old, are being persuaded 
to substitute the deliberate choice of good books 
for the random reading of anything that hap- 
pens to fall in their way. Every reader whose 
application is thus diverted represents so much 
clear gain to the cause of enlightenment. What 
if such a reader does for a time flounder blindly 
about in the unwonted element, and display all 
sorts of crudities of thought and expression ; 
is it not better that he should grope toward the 
light than dwell contented in the outer dark- 
ness ? Our word to the perplexed reader, then, 
would be no counsel of despair, but an exhort- 
ation to persist in what may at first and for 
long seem a thorny path. The world is wonder- 
fully interesting, and good books are the me- 
dium through which its wonder and interest 
mainly shine. There is no individual of so 
mean endowment as to remain wholly unre- 
sponsive to this light, and if one stimulus after 
another be applied, the right one will surely be 
found at last. 

Of a truth, the argument which we have 
undertaken to controvert is so insubstantial in 
its logic (if it be intended for anything more 
than a whimsicality or the utterance of a petu- 
lant mood) that it is dissipated by its own airi- 
ness. It would hardly deserve consideration 
were it not a specific application of a far larger 
argument that has done much mischief in the 
world. The most dangerous enemy of democ- 
racy is the comfortable persuasion of superior 
persons that it is entiiely fitting they should 
remain superior, and that things are very well 
as they are. In their interpretation, the prin- 
ciple of noblesse oblige becomes condescension 
merely ; it does not lapse into sympathy, still 
less does it join actively in the effort to lift 
those of low condition. In this view democracy 
is condemned because it does not at once usher 
in the ideal state, popular education is depre- 
cated because it tends to raise the masses from 
their proper place and thus fosters discontent, 
the oppression of the backward races is con- 
doned because we are enjoined by both destiny 
and duty to see that they are kept safely in 
leading-strings. This is an argument with 
which no generous soul can have any patience 
at all, for it seeks to shut the door of hope in 
the face of the majority of mankind. And be- 
cause the paper we have just had under dis- 
cussion seems to us dangerously symptomatic 
of this false and narrow view of human nature, 
we have taken it as a text for more serious 
comment than its own intrinsic weight would 
warrant. 



THE QUAKER IN FICTION. 

Since the time when Mr*. Stowe portrayed the 
doughty person of Phineas Fletcher in '* Uncle 
Tom's Cabin," the Q laker has been a not unfa- 
miliar figure in fiction. There is something of the 
perverseness of fate in the fact that a people who 
have been taught to look upon the reading of fic- 
tion as baneful should themselves come to play a 
considerable role in imaginative literature. " The 
Quaker," says Bancroft, "distrusts the fine arts; 
tbey are so easily perverted to purposes of super- 
stition and the delight of the senses." Accordingly, 
Qiakerism, in its deep-rooted craving for the un- 
adorned realities of life and for deliverance from 
the mere show-world, has always frowned upon the 
literature of romance. The tales of fairy-land and 
of chivalry, and the song of the troubadour, have 
not been admitted to the carefully-guardt-d house- 
hold of the Q taker. Even to-day, in the most 
conservative secondary schools nf the Friends, the 
reading of u The Merchant of Venice," of " Ivan- 
hoe," and " The Vicar of Wakefield," books among 
the College English requirements, is either done 
under protest or their equivalents in actual history 
or biography are substituted. 

The members of the Society of Friends have 
been brought up to deny themselves the aesthetic 
enrichment of life, the pleasures of art as expressed 
through music, pictures, the drama, and the novel. 
They have counted among their numbers prophets 
and reformers, but not philosophers or artists. 
Hence it is not strange that the romantic output 
of the S iciety is inconsiderable, a quantity practi- 
cally negligible. In a few instances where their 
own sectaries have practised the contemned art, 
the result has been destitute of literary importance. 
The moral purpose has always been too far in ex- 
cess of the artistic to secure a public outside of the 
Friendly world. Disregarding, then, the few and 
futile attempts of the Quaker to interpret himself 
through the medium of the imagination, let us turn 
to the more numerous efforts of '• the world's people " 
to interpret him. 

If the Quaker has been represented with inade- 
quate success by those of his own denomination 
who understand the principles underlying his id io- 
syncracies, he has suffered in equal if not in like 
measure from those outside the fold. It is not an 
easy thing for a non-member to obtain a sympa- 
thetic understanding of a sect whose very exclusive- 
ness, social and religious, binds them into a kind of 
brotherhood. Too often his portrayors seize merely 
upon the striking or picture>que externals, use ex- 
cessive daubs of gray in the portraiture of bonnet 
and waistcoat, and drag in with unnatural frequency 
the "thou" and "thee." The result is a caricature 
rather than a character. As yet, no one has ade- 
quately rendered the hereditary quiet of the Quaker 
without investing his character with a certain acidity. 
No interpreter has put into abiding form the

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Quaker's bold demeanor in the face of all the powers 
of the world, and his loyalty to divine command, 
which are the basal principles of the Society. 

In the main, two types of Q laker have been 
presented in fiction. In the first, the outlines 
approach those of the Puritan ; and the Friend is 
hard, austere, forbidding. In the second he is 
in a nascent state, is emerging from the dominance 
of inherited Quakerism, or is perhaps in open 
revolt against its irksome tenets. As a rule, we 
find him more human and more appealing when 
there is a rift within the lute of his Quakerism. 
In " Hugh Wynne " both types are exemplified. 
The father, John Wynne, is stern, implacable, 
scornful of the innocent joys of life. His character 
is unrelieved by any touch of human sweetness; 
and we wonder how the grim and silent man could 
ever have won the hand of the merry-hearted 
daughter of France. The son and hero, however, 
whose soul is on fire with love of war, becomes an 
apostate to the doctrine of non-resistance, and wins 
the approval of the reader for his dash and gener- 
osity. In the story called " Thee and Thou," Dr. 
Mitchell says of his heroine, " The greatest charm 
of this woman was in her pretty little revolts against 
Quaker ways, and her endless sympathy with every- 
body's tastes and pursuits." 

The question here naturally suggests itself, 
whether the Friend, except the Friend in the 
unmaking, is fitted to take a prominent place in 
fiction ; whether in stories of war, conquest, and 
adventure, the typical Friend can be anything more 
than an accident, a portion of the background. The 
difficulty of evolving romance from material so 
deficient in color and sentiment is suggested by 
Charles Lamb's characterization : " I cannot like 
the Quaker (as Desdemona would say) ' to live with 
them.' I am all-over sophisticated with humors, 
fancies, craving hourly sympathy. I must have 
books, pictures, theaters, chit-chat, scandal, jokes, 
ambiguities, and a thousand whim-whams, which 
their simpler taste can do without." 

In " John Halifax," the old tanner, Abel Fletcher, 
is an unyielding piece of Quaker stoicism, and belongs 
to the type of John Wynne. It is not until death 
is imminent that a strange tenderness possesses him 
and glorifies his end. 

Mrs. Barr, in her story of "Friend Olivia," 
treats of that last wave of the Reformation, the 
formative period of Quakerism, and uses the dra- 
matic background in which Cromwell, Charles II., 
and George Fox are the chief figures. She has not 
been altogether successful in giving to this profound 
religious movement a Quaker atmosphere ; nor in 
the matter of detail is she faithful to the Quaker 
ideal, for the material surroundings suggest too much 
luxury and personal indulgence. Ancestral pictures, 
Brussels lace, and "women in white satin" are 
hardly in keeping with the unworldly teachings of 
the founder of the sect. Very little definition is 
given to the character of the mystic, George Fox ; 



the reader is not impressed with the dynamic force 
of the man who made the hearts of his listeners 
"tremble at the word of the Lord." 

In Mrs. Parr's tale of " Dorothy Fox," — an old- 
fashioned story, sweet and entertaining, — we get a 
sympathetic picture of an ingenuous little Quakeress 
with a forbidden taste for martial exploit. But 
here we have also a representative of the first type, 
an impossible taciturn young lover who follows a 
life of almost monastic asceticism. 

Perhaps no one has been more successful in 
seizing the essentials of Quakerism than has Mrs. 
Mason in her story of " The Windflower." Here 
is depicted the sharp contrast between the colorless 
and formless worship of the Society of Friends and 
the elaborate ritualism of the liturgical church. 
The author shows unusual understanding of Quaker 
ideals when she invests father and daughter, the two 
representatives of the sect, with large-hearted tol- 
erance, patience, and tenderness. The more lofty 
strains of their religion are not subordinated to 
extraneous drab and sectarian foible. 

It may be that the present reaction among mod- 
ern Friends in favor of music and the expression of 
artistic enthusiasm indicates the passing of the 
traditional Quaker, whose dress and speech made 
him stand out as a figure distinct from the world's 
people. According to statistics, the conservative 
membership of the Society of Friends is steadily 
diminishing. A recent writer in the " London Spec- 
tator" says : " It is a pity that the sect which has done 
most to make of philanthropy a dominant factor in 
modern life is hastening to an honored grave." The 
haste, however, is less marked in America than in 
England, for the primitive principles of Quakerism 
have been more persistent here than in the mother- 
country. The more conservative American Quaker 
has jealously guarded the doctrines of Friends 
brought over by William Penn and his colonists, 
who were protestants against many of the social and 
religious forms then dominant in England. One 
may trace here a process analagous to that of the 
later survival of Shakespeare's English in the new 
land of America. Just as the philologist must look 
to New England for obsolescent bits of Elizabethan 
English, already obsolete in England, so the student 
of Quakerism must turn to Philadelphia and the 
surrounding country, if he would find the historic 
speech and dress which have disappeared among 
the more radical votaries in England. Here by the 
simplicity of their worship they still maintain their 
" testimoney " against the sensuous forms of faith. 
Their meeting-houses, never imposing or beautiful, 
are bare of ornament, and are without pulpit or 
desk ; their services are distinguished by absence 
of all liturgy, music, or prepared sermon. The 
phraseology of the Quaker also has lingered longer 
in America than in England, and in and around 
Philadelphia one still hears the quaint language of 
the memoirs and journals of the early Friends, such 
phrases as " steeple houses " appearing in suppli-

cation, "hat honor," "creaturely activity," and 
" meetings for sufferings." There is, however, a 
gradual relaxing of the old uncompromising forms 
of spotless dress and formal speech. And it may 
be that as the traditional type of the drab-coated 
and drab-petticoated generation becomes more rare, 
the vanishing sectary will so gain in charm and 
poetic quality as to offer rich material to the future 
romancer. Caroline Ladd Crew. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



THE ORIGINATORS OF THE MODERN SHORT 

STORY. 

( To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 

I think it is Alphonse Daudet who, in one of his 
inimitable contes, speaks of a man who was perfectly 
sane on all ordinary topics, bat whose mind suffered 
shipwreck whenever he considered one particular topic. 
An analogy might be drawn between Daudet's charac- 
ter and most recent critics of the Short Story. They 
whose remarks on all other subjects are sound and well- 
informed, seem to lose their balance most unaccountably 
when dealing with this particular subject. There has 
lately been a deal of cheap criticism put forth in regard 
to the Short Story ; and while the initiated cannot 
be misled thereby, it is to be feared that these biased 
statements will, unless controverted, deceive the multi- 
tude of readers. 

Professor Brander Matthews is one of the offenders; 
and Professor T. M. Parrott is another. On page 
75 of his work on " The Philosophy of the Short 
Story," Professor Matthews says: "From Chaucer and 
Boccaccio we must spring across the centuries until we 
came to Hawthorne and Poe almost without finding 
another name that insists upon enrollment." And 
Professor Parrott has recently been holding forth in 
a somewhat similar manner in the pages of a well-known 
monthly, a propos of Guy de Maupassant. 

The Short Story owes a great deal both to Hawthorne 
and to Poe; but one critic has stumbled blindly after 
another in calling either of these writers " the origin- 
ator of the modern Short Story." Both Me'rime'e and 
Balzac wrote some of their very best Short Stories be- 
fore either Hawthorne or Poe had written any of theirs. 
And the best work of Me'rime'e and of Balzac has not 
since been surpassed in this genre. It is of Balzac's 
« La Grande Breteche " (1832) that Professor William 
P. Trent has well said : « It is as dramatic a piece of 
writing as Balzac ever did, and is almost if not quite as 
perfect a Short Story as any that has since been written 
in France." In his story " A Seashore Drama" (1835), 
Balzac has voiced a never-to-be-forgotten ideal of the 
Short Story in these words: " A narrative sharp and 
incisive as a blow with an axe." 

It needs only a glance at the chronology of the ear- 
liest stories of Me'rime'e, Balzac, Hawthorne, and Poe, 
to see that the credit for precedence belongs to the 
two French writers. Washington Irving's " Rip Van 
Winkle" (1819) and Sir Walter Scott's "Wandering 
Willie's Tale" (1824) are not properly Short Stories, 
according to the modern definition, but may be said to 
be on the dividing line between the modern Short 
Story and the ancient tale. In the lists below are placed 



the first six stories of each of the four writers in ques- 
tion, with the dates of their first publication. 

Mkrimee. Hawthorns. 

Mateo Falcone .... 1829 The Gentle Boy .... 1832 

The Vision of Charles XL . 1829 Roger Malvin's Burial . . 1832 

The Taking of the Redoubt 1829 The Wires of the Dead . . 1832 

Tamango 1829 Major Molineaux .... 1832 

Federigo 1829 The Canterbury Pilgrims . 1833 

The Pearl of Toledo . . . 1829 The Seven Vagabonds . . 1833 

Balzac. Poe. 

ElVerdugo 1830 MS. Found in a Bottle 1833 (1831?) 

Adieu 1830 Berenice 1833 

Barraaine 1830 Morella 1835 

A Passion in the Desert . 1830 Lionising 1835 

An Episode under the Terror 1830 The Unparalleled Adventures 

The Conscript 1831 of One Hans Pfall . . 1835 

The Assignation .... 183$ 

All six of the Me'rime'e stories listed are of the first 
rank, which Taine pronounced masterpieces of fiction, 
destined to immortality as classics. All, or all but one 
(" Sarrasine "), of the Balzac stories are of the first 
rank. Of the Hawthorne stories, all but the first are of 
Hawthorne's second-best, and none of them are equal 
to the best of the Me'rime'e or Balzac lists. Of the Poe 
stories, only two, the first and the last listed, are up to 
his highest standard. Poe himself tells us, in a note 
affixed to the " MS. Found in a Bottle," that this story 
was " originally published in 1831," but we have only 
his word for it. The facts of the matter seem to be 
thus: Meximee's first really productive year in the 
Short Story was 1829; Balzac's, 1830; Hawthorne's, 
1832; Poe's, 1835. By reason of " The Gentle Boy " 
(1832), and by that only, Hawthorne could claim pri- 
ority to Poe. But this is annulled if we accept Poe's 
statement as to the date of the "MS. Found in a 
Bottle." The only clear way out of the matter is to 
accept the first efforts of Hawthorne and Poe as coinci- 
dent in production. But Me'rime'e came before Balzac, 
and both Me'rime'e and Balzac preceded Hawthorne 
and Poe. Hawthorne has had ascribed to him some 
work earlier than "The Gentle Boy," but it is about as 
worthless as the first efforts of a genius well can be; 
and there is no positive proof of its authenticity. 

It is not well to let our pride in American literature 
allow us to distort facts. Both Hawthorne's and Poe's 
service to the Short Story was great. But " the orig- 
inators of the modern Short Story " are Me'rime'e and 
Balzac. This is not to say that Me'rime'e and Balzac 
owe nothing to still earlier writers, for their work in 
this genre. The Short Story, like all other literary 
forms, has had a gradual growth. But in their work 
the modern Short Story, with its economy of means and 
its precision of effect, found its first perfect expression.

One of the most valuable features of the " Centenary" 
edition of Emerson's Works now being published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. is the several portraits 
of Emerson, which are now for the first time reproduced 
with absolute fidelity to the original daguerreotypes 
and photographs. The photogravures contained in 
the " Centenary " edition include reproductions of a 
daguerreotype of Emerson taken in England in 1847 
and now in the possession of the Carlyle family; the 
two fine photographs by Hawes in 1854 (one entirely 
new to the public) ; a superb daguerreotype by Whipple 
in 1859 which has never been engraved; and the photo- 
graph taken by Foss in 1874, which is the best portrait 
of the poet and philosopher in his declining years.

Mr. Trowbridge's Reminiscences.* 

Mr. Trowbridge's narrative of his life and 
labors is interesting not only for its own sake, 
but also because it takes us once more among 
those New England immortals who, lost to sight, 
are every year increasingly dear to memory. 
Born in 1827, and devoting himself unswerv- 
ingly from his youth to the cause of good lit- 
erature, he has every right but the claim of 
nativity to a seat in that select circle. Ogden, 
in western New York, was his birthplace, and 
so near to midnight was he born that he en- 
joyed the singular privilege of choosing be- 
tween two possible birthdays, the 17th and the 
18th of September. It is almost superfluous 
to add that the earlier date was the choice of 
his boyhood, the later that of his adult years. 

Among the writer's childhood experiences 
that appeal so strongly to the boy, or girl, in 
us all, let us select one. A swamp, apparently 
impassable and filled with all sorts of delight- 
ful imaginary terrors, lay before the Trow- 
bridge homestead. Into this terra incognita, 
however, the boy John mustered up courage 
to penetrate at the height of an unusually dry 
season. Scrambling through the thicket, he 
found to his surprise that it was nothing but 
an ordinary belt of woods, with high-and-dry 
farm lands beyond. From that day the swamp 
lost its terrors, and he almost wished he had 
left it unexplored. 

Beginning to write verses at thirteen, the 
young poet made his first appearance in print 
at sixteen, in the county newspaper. His verses, 
on the Tomb of Napoleon, had been written as 
a school exercise, and owed their publication 
either to his teacher or to his father. After 
much private reading and study, a taste of the 
classics at a Lockport academy, and two terms 
of school-teaching, he started at nineteen for 
New York City to earn his living by his pen, — 
of course with the traditional roll of manu- 
script in his pocket or in his carpet-bag. There 
was the splendid audacity of genius in this ob- 
scure country boy's plunge into the life of the 
great city, and his successful struggle to main- 
tain himself by his pen almost exclusively, de- 
spite tempting openings in other directions, 
makes interesting reading. After fifteen months 
he removed to Boston, being still under twenty-

sons. By John Townsend Trowbridge. Illustrated. Boston :

one years of age. Story-writing, play-writing, 
and editorial work followed, with now and 
then the publication of a poem. Both his se- 
rials and many of his short stories appeared 
later in book form, and are too well known to 
call for further mention here. It is not so 
well known that five volumes of verse stand 
also to his credit. In the capacity of editor, 
Mr. Trowbridge is best remembered as the 
able conductor of " Our Young Folks," until 
its publishers courted disaster by less success- 
ful enterprises than that excellent magazine. 

Mr. Trowbridge's pages are enlivened with 
many an anecdote that will endear him still 
further to his admirers. Here is one illustra- 
tive of his unwillingness to say no to the bor- 
rower who is always with us. 

■ After I had been so far prospered as to be able to 
place a small deposit in a savings-bank, the father of a 
family once besought me for a loan of sixty dollars. 
When I told him, to my sincere regret, that I had no 
such sum at command, he made answer that his quar- 
ter's rent was due, that he had been unable to collect 
some bills he had relied on to make up the needful 
sum, and he didn't know which way to turn, if I 
couldn't help him. ' I haven't it,' I repeated; ' but ' — 
I thought of my poor little savings-bank deposit, and 
of a family man's natural distress on being unable to 
pay his rent — ' I might possibly raise it for you.' Al- 
though I knew there would be a loss of accumulated 
and prospective interest if I withdrew my money from 
the bank, and I could not think of taking interest from 
a friend, his expressions of gratitude paid me in ad- 
vance for any such sacrifice. I went at once and drew 
the sixty dollars, which I handed him without saying 
bow I had come by it. He paid me in a week or two, 
thanked me warmly, and added this naive remark : 
' If you hadn't lent me the money, I should have had 
to take it out of the savings-bank, and have lost the 
interest.' I smiled and held my peace." 

Speaking of his literary passions, Mr. Trow- 
bridge names Emerson as the writer to whom 
his debt was greatest. At first, Epes Sargent's 
satirical comments on the Concord sage had 
inclined the young man against him ; but a 
chance quotation that met his eye sent him 
eagerly to the Essays, and thereafter he was 
a willing captive to their charm. On one oc- 
casion, when Sargent chanced to find the ob- 
ject of his satire browsing among the books at 
the shop of Phillips, Sampson & Co., he asked 
the senior partner for an introduction. The 
publisher conveyed the request to Emerson, 
who bent his brows and replied in his slow, 
emphatic way, — 

«' ' Sargent ? Mr. Epes Sargent, of the Evening Tran- 
script ? ' Then, after a pause : ' I have nothing for 
Mr. Sargent, and Mr. Sargent has nothing for me.' 
Perfectly dispassionate and dignified ; but there was 
nothing more to be said, and Mr. Phillips had to go

back to his visitor and tell him that the desired intro- 
duction was declined. I was pleased through and 
through to learn how my own grievance in the matter 
had been atoned for, and still more interested to find 
that even the serene Concord sage was, after all, hu- 
man, and capable of a righteous resentment, — if that 
can indeed be called by so misleading a name which 
was more likely the feeling he avowed in his letter to 
Henry Ware, regarding their differences of opinion : 
' I shall read what you and other good men write, as I 
have always done, — glad when you speak my thought, 
and skipping the page that has nothing for me.' He 
simply * skipped ' Mr. Sargent." 

At one point in this delightful volume the 
reader will be tempted to pick a quarrel with 
the author. It is where the latter, after graph- 
ically detailing the incidents that led up to the 
threatened duel between Charles G. H alpine 
and the poet Handiboe — a duel in which he 
himself was to have acted as Halpine's second 
— suddenly breaks off with this lame and im- 
potent conclusion : 

" How our two principals would have demeaned them- 
selves if they had thus been brought face to face, wea- 
pons in hand, can only be conjectured; for the affair, 
even while our plans were pending, was precipitated 
to a most unlooked-for, calamitous conclusion, the cir- 
cumstances of which, although I was deeply concerned 
in it, cannot be related here." 

Was it the old continued-story habit that made 
our narrator thus leave his readers in the lurch? 
In this case, unfortunately, there is no cheering 
prospect of an early sequel, which is all the 
more regrettable as the incident is not referred 
to by the biographers of the genial " Miles 
O'Reilly." 

More than one of the Autocrat's witty say- 
ings are recorded by Mr. Trowbridge. They 
will be new to most readers. When the strife 
was raging over the true discoverer of anaes- 
thetics, and a monument in his honor was pro- 
posed, Dr. Holmes suggested that it should 
consist of a central group symbolizing painless 
surgery, a statue of Morton on one side, one of 
Jackson on the other, and an inscription below 
44 To E(i)ther." The writer himself was well 
acquainted with Dr. Morton, and unhesitat- 
ingly champions his claims. 

Bronson Alcott's sancta simplicitas is amus- 
ingly illustrated by an anecdote. 

"A friend of mine once saw him on a Nantasket 
boat, without a ticket, or money to pay for one. When 
called to account by the fare-taker, he remarked inno- 
cently that the trip had attracted him, and that he be- 
lieved 'there would be some provision,' — a belief that 
was immediately vindicated by a passenger recogniz- 
ing him, and stepping up to make the said ' provision.' " 

Many and interesting are Mr. Trowbridge's 
memories of Walt Whitman. He clears up the 
disputed point of Whitman's indebtedness to 



Emerson, proving conclusively that "Leaves 
of Grass " was not written, even in its earliest 
form, until the poet had become a reader and 
admirer of Emerson. Beside Whitman's own 
assertions to the author to this effect, several 
instances are cited of Emerson's thought in 
Whitman's verse. The eccentric poet's sturdy 
defiance of criticism is illustrated in a small 
way by his refusal to correct a false phrase, 
Santa Spirita, which he had coined and printed 
as good Italian, although it was pointed out 
to him afterward that Spirito Santo, or, in- 
deed, Holy Spirit, would serve his purpose 
equally well. But he perversely retained the 
original blunder in later editions. 

Preliminary tastes of 44 My Own Story " 
were given to the public in the " Atlantic 
Monthly." The book itself is a much more 
considerable and valuable work. Numerous 
photographs, some of them unfamiliar, add not 
a little to its attractiveness. The total im- 
pression on the reader is of a life so worthily 
lived that even the fullest account of it need 
not shrink from the publicity of the types. 
Especially gratifying is it to recall the author's 
courageous rescue of a boy from drowning at 
Mystic Lake, in the winter of 1872, — an act 
of humanity which the Massachusetts Humane 
Society rewarded with a large silver medal. 
The writer modestly refers to the incident as 
44 attesting qualities the quietest life may con- 
ceal, even from their possessor." One is glad 
to find in this life of honest endeavor and 
worthy achievement one more illustration of 
the truth of Milton's assertion regarding him 
44 who would not be frustrate of his hope to 
write well hereafter in laudable things."

England in the Nineteenth

The title, the preface, and the method of 
Mr. Dorman's pretentious 44 History of the

judged by the first volume, alike inevitably 
challenge comparison with the popular yet 
authentic review of England in the Eighteenth

parison is unfortunate for Mr. Dorman. The 
principal characteristics of the earlier work are 
readableness, due to a charming and forcible

style ; thorough assimilation and organization 
of facts, so that tendencies and periods of 
development are treated with a logical con- 
clusiveness ; and exhaustive research, in so far 
as materials for study were accessible at the 
time of writing. In all three respects, Mr. 
Dorman is far below the standard of Lecky. 
His style is not bad, but it is distinctly not 
good. Its dry pedanticism oppresses one with 
the sense of a laborious task honestly and con- 
scientiously done, yet done without inspiration 
and without that genius for expression which 
characterizes a great historical work. His 
facts are given with painstaking exactness, and 
with careful references ; but far from being 
organized and arranged for the reader's bene- 
fit, they are made to follow each other in such 
strict order in point of time that they become 
a mere catalogue of events — almost, indeed, 
an ordinary epitome of history. His research 
has been exhaustive in one particular field of 
investigation, but other and easily accessible 
sources have been largely neglected. 

Judged, then, upon standards of ability in 
expression and authoritativeness of statement, 
the first volume of the present work is not a 
successful general history. Possibly, however, 
in the light of the modern tendency among his- 
torical students to demand exact information 
rather than illuminative treatment, Mr. Dor- 
man's work may be received with commenda- 
tion for his study of British Foreign Records ; 
and had he been content to produce a mon- 
ograph setting forth the contents of these 
documents, in place of attempting a general 
history, he would have been praised for hav- 
ing made a genuine contribution to historical 
knowledge. He gives us more information 
than any other author on the official diplomatic 
correspondecce of England in the period cov- 
ered. This has been his main study, and this 
should have been the subject of his monograph. 
Unfortunately for Mr. Dorman, official diplo- 
matic correspondence for any period forms but 
a small part of the material necessary to the 
writing of history. An excellent illustration 
of this is offered in the treatment of Malmes- 
bury's mission to Paris in 1796, ostensibly to 
arrange for peace with France. Mr. Dorman 
makes much of this incident, referring to it in 
his preface even, because he claims to have 
discovered evidence contradictory to the view 
set forth by Lecky, that Pitt honestly intended 
the mission to be productive of peace. Mr. 
Dorman's view is that Malmesbury was sent 
solely for the purpose of securing information 



on the military and political condition of 
France ; and this view he supports with cita- 
tions from the records of the Foreign Office, 
quoting also Malmesbury 's private correspond- 
ence. The correctness of this conclusion is not 
here denied, though it is at least questionable ; 
but the important point is that the author has 
been content to base that conclusion on the 
official records and on Malmesbury 's corre- 
spondence alone, and has wholly neglected, 
indeed seems to be unaware of the existence 
of, such important sources of information on 
the point in question as the Dropmore Manu- 
scripts, giving private and secret instructions 
to diplomats, and other important documents 
and letters lately published by the Historical 
Manuscripts Commission. Moreover, the polit- 
ical situation in England at the exact moment 
when Malmesbury departed for Paris, a situa- 
tion of the highest importance to a correct 
understanding of the mission itself, is wholly 
neglected, — an omission permissible in a spe- 
cialized study, but indefensible in what pur- 
ports to be a comprehensive history of England. 
The illustration just given is characteristic 
of the entire work. Its value as a history is 
therefore confined to two services : it may be 
useful as a convenient epitome of events, and 
it will be a convenient reference for those 
historical students who desire the latest in- 
formation on questions of fact brought out by 
researches in the British Foreign Office Rec- 
ords. Even in this latter, however, the work, 
if put forth within any reasonable limit, must 
soou lose its one particular claim to importance, 
since the records in question are not open for 
study subsequent to the year 1833. And, fi- 
nally, it must be evident that anything ap- 
proaching an authoritative and conclusive 
history of the British Empire in the nineteenth 
century is as yet an impossibility. The best 
that can be hoped for is a practically contem- 
poraneous, and fairly exact, general survey.

A Drama of Justice and 
Humanity.* 



Each new thing by a great man whose work 
is already familiar shows us the well-known 
figure, but sometimes in strange guise. One 
hardly knew, at first, where to meet with M. 
Maeterlinck in " Monna Vanna." Here was 
a play of the early Renaissance, and definitely 
of places in Italy. Place and time were precise. 
There was nothing of that strange and mystic 
country which we have come to think of as 
Maeterlinck's own, — that belated Gallic cross 
between Preraphaelitism and German romance, 
that country where the subterraneous ocean 
laps between basaltic walls, and where deep 
dungeons with iron-studded doors shut out 
light and the cheerful sun, the land of ancient 
forest and of fountains, the land of wise old 
kings and weak young men and lovely large* 
eyed maids and wives with long locks of gold. 
Nor was there any everyday realism either, 
such as Maeterlinck approved in theory so long 
ago, — the realism of the static theatre, of 
the old, old house, of the lamp-lit parlor of 
" L'Intrus," of the evening garden of " L'ln- 
terieur." " Monna Vanna " seemed as though 
it were to be an ordinary play, as ordinary at 
least as Browning's " Luria." 

M. Maeterlinck had heretofore done some- 
thing to render himself intelligible. " Ardiane 
et Barbe Bleu " had given some light as to the 
significance of his earlier romance. But when 
one begins "Monna Vanna " one is again in the 
dark. It seems far too ordinary. 

The only relief is that terrible prosy old 
man, Marco. He is a relief because in his 
inevitable, undeniable, impracticable appeal to 
Justice we recognize something of the phi- 
losopher whom we have known, if not of the 
playwright. Not because M. Maeterlinck has 
heretofore been prosy, but because he has 
sought for that absolute common-sense consid- 
eration of matters of human passion which 
Marco seems to have obtained. It seems curi- 
ous to speak of a typical character of Maeter- 
linck's being instinct with common-sense. But 
when Guido, the general of helplessly belea- 
guered Pisa, is so naturally outraged at the 
idea of sending his wife to the camp of the 
Florentine conqueror, even as the sole means 
of saving his city, what sound good sense un- 
touched by romantic foolishness is to be found 

•Monna Vanna. A Play in Three Acts. By Maurice 
Maeterlinck. Translated by Alexis Ir£n£e Dupont Coleman.

in Marco's " Yet ask yourself if you have the 
right to give a whole city up to death, and but 
to put off by some sad hours an inevitable ill : 
when the city is taken, Vanna will be in the 
victor's power . . ." Surely that is sensible. 
If Guido will agree to what is sure to take 
place, the city will be saved ; otherwise all will 
be lost together. But he cannot agree ; he will 
not even give Vanna herself a chance to decide 
on any such question. But Marco has already, 
very sensibly, taken the precaution of inform- 
ing her before he told Guido ; he saw in her a 
kind of force of which her humdrum husband 
was unaware. "Everyone sees in another that 
which he sees in himself : each one knows him 
in a different way and according to his power 
of knowing." Guido will not even report the 
matter to the council. But Marco has reported 
it already, and the council with nobility and 
firmness has put the fate of the city in Vanna's 
hands. " She will give answer for both," says 
the indignant captain. "I hope so," says 
the imperturbable old man, serenely conscious 
that she will accept and do what is really for 
the best of all. We cannot help sympathiz- 
ing with Guido ; he is human, but how far 
from the profound sagacity of the admirable 
Belgian ! 

In the second act we get a little nearer what 
we are accustomed to ; and in the last we should 
surely be quite at home. 

When Monna Vanna goes in her mantle and 
sandals to the tent of Prinzivalle, she hears 
that they have met before. Is it malicious to 
point out that it was long since, at a moment 
when she was weeping by a fountain? That 
single touch allies Monna Vanna, the noble, 
the devoted, the stately, to Alladine, Selysette, 
Melisande, so that we are by no means shocked 
when her heart turns from her simple, com- 
monplace, selfish husband to the devoted ideal- 
istic condottiere. Not in any ordinary sense, 
of course, — it is no vulgar loving and being 
loved, — but she recognizes that there is some- 
thing akin to her own high soul in this spirit 
which has remained for twenty years on fire 
with the intensity of a single moment. They 
return together to Pisa, which they have de- 
livered, — for the victorious mercenary, dis- 
trusted very rightly by the ungrateful re- 
public which he serves, is to be arrested by his 
own soldiers. Here, surely, is as serene self- 
confidence in the higher justice as that of old 
Marco. 

It is not astonishing that Guido does not 
appreciate this high-mindedness. He is exceed-

ingly angry, in the first place, that his wife 
should have gone on any such excursion, even 
with the best of motives : he has not such re- 
pose on universal wisdom that he can believe 
that she really loves him if she would do such 
a thing. Nor when she tells him that she comes 
back as pure as she went, does he believe that 
either. Further, when she presents to him 
Prinzivalle he so far mistakes her as to fancy 
that she has brought him back to be revenged 
upon him, as he himself had thought of a re- 
venge in years to come. He cannot believe 
that Prinzivalle would have spared Monna Van- 
na for love of her ; nor, of course, can he be- 
lieve anything else that comes after. It is all 
eminently right, wise, just, all that they have 
done; but who can pretend that the crude 
world of husband and bystander will appre- 
ciate ? They feel, it is true, " an honor more 
real and a happiness other than that which leads 
the rest astray." But when she tells how she 
and Prinzivalle have but exchanged a kiss upon 
the forehead, who will believe ? Guido sees that 
he may be prejudiced, and he appeals to the 
crowd to see who will believe. 

Marco does believe it; but the others are 
as we may imagine. And as a close of the 
play Monna Vanna, desperate at the impossi- 
bility of living further on the basis of the 
truth, sends Prinzivalle to a dungeon on the 
pretense before her husband and the crowd 
that it is only that she may herself finally take 
a fit vengeance upon him. 

I have read somewhere that Maeterlinck had 
ceased to be pessimistic. His earlier plays 
always present people in the grip of an over- 
mastering fate. Mankind is but a pygmy in 
the hands of unknown and unavoidable forces 
that hurry it to the tomb by various sure 
though devious ways. That conception is cer- 
tainly absent in "Monna Vanna"; we do not 
have weak and often silly lovers devoted from 
the first exchange of glances to an irrevocable 
fate. So far, M. Maeterlinck doubtless is not 
so pessimistic in "Monna Vanna" as in some 
earlier plays, — so far he may be called an opti- 
mist. But when he looks out at the world he 
is surely not very optimistic. For what is the 
case of this play? It is that though as we 
read we can sympathize entirely with the sense 
of justice of Marco, the simple truth of Monna 
Vanna, the unmeasured devotion of Prinzivalle, 
— although we can take their view and pro- 
nounce it right, yet we must also have a fellow- 
feeling for the others who will not believe. 
Guido is selfish, no doubt ; blind, by no means 



high-minded, but a man for all that, and not 
very different from other men. And sympa- 
thize as we may with the others, we must admit 
that the world, and ourselves in it, is still very 
like Guido. And perhaps we cannot but feel 
that it is quite as well that it is so, for all our 
human institutions, customs, habits ; having 
developed on the basis that men are human, it 
is well enough that for a time they should 
remain so. 

But if so, it would seem that justice — 
Maeterlinckian justice — can hardly, as yet, 
live in this world. People do not understand 
it. Their personality blinds them : they agree 
to generalizations in the abstract, but they are 
outraged at the particular application when it 
comes to them in some form that touches them 
keenly. Perhaps this may be for a time only : 
M. Maeterlinck studies to bring that time to 
an end. 

Such would seem to be the moral position, 
as we may say, in which M. Maeterlinck wrote 
" Monna Vanna." To take it as the net out- 
come of the play, to fix our eyes upon it to the 
exclusion of all else, is certainly an uncritical 
thing to do. But when a man comes before 
the world as a philosopher as well as a play- 
wright, we may, perhaps, be excused for busy- 
ing ourselves with the philosophy of his plays. 
In this case, if we did not do so, there would be 
little else to occupy us. There are in the play, 
it is true, not a few of those simple, direct, 
glimpses of truth which M. Maeterlinck's work 
rarely lacks ; but save for them and the philos- 
ophy, there is not much in the painful and 
preposterous story to interest the reader. Only 
as being a powerful presentation of some truth 
of life can such an episode really absorb one's 
attention. 

As has been said, " Monna Vanna " is a de- 
parture. As such it does not seem to be per- 
manent. " Joyzelle," which was produced last 
spring, has not been translated, but it is worth 
mention here. It resembles neither M. Mae- 
terlinck's earlier work nor that which just pre- 
cedes it ; nor does it carry on the ideas of 
either, so far as is superficially obvious. While 
it deals vaguely with unseen powers, and with 
justice, its main motive is presented with a 
simplicity with which it has not heretofore ap- 
peared in M. Maeterlinck's writings. That mo- 
tive is the absolute power of Love. Here our 
author is on safer ground than that which he 
sometimes occupies, and his work is in conse- 
quence more commonplace.

The Historical Study of Philosophy.* 

The multiplication, in the last few years, of 
books intended to serve as an introduction to 
the historical study of philosophy, and of the 
great philosophical systems, marks, one may 
hope, a growing sense of the value which such 
a study has for culture and for life. It has 
been quite too common to find among educated 
men a conception of philosophy which is noth- 
ing less than a caricature, and a consequent 
disparagement of its aims and achievements 
which only a profound ignorance can excuse. 
It is hard to avoid setting this down as one 
more evidence of the intellectual flabbiness 
which has seemed likely to overtake us and our 
education, and which draws back from any 
really honest and thorough-going scrutiny of 
things in the intellectual realm, satisfied with 
vague impressions and half interpreted intui- 
tions and feelings. Philosophy is only the 
record of man's most stubborn attempts to 
understand himself and the world ; and a cul- 
ture which ignores these can hardly claim to be 
well-rounded. 

Two introductory outlines of the history of 
philosophy have appeared during the present 
year, and both of these have distinct merits. 
The most noticeable feature of Turner's " His- 
tory of Philosophy " is the thoroughness with 
which it deals with a period which has usually 
been somewhat neglected — the Middle Ages. 
This furnishes, indeed, as the preface states, 
the special excuse for the book's existence. 
The account of Mediaeval Philosophy, accord- 
ingly, occupies nearly a third of the six hun- 
dred odd pages of the volume, and it supplies 
what probably is the most convenient summary 
of the scholastic writers that is available. To 
one who is not convinced, with the author, that 
Scholasticism at its best represents the most 
solid achievement of human thought, to which 
we are destined to go back after the vagaries 
which have led much of recent philosophy 
astray, it seems doubtful whether it is wise ped- 
agogically to utilize this material for the ordi- 
nary student ; but no doubt for a work which 
pretends to cover the field impartially, it rep- 
resents more nearly the true proportion of em- 
phasis than does the treatment of the ordinary 
text-book. Apart from its treatment of this 
special period, however, the book has merits as

osophy. By Arthur Stone Dewing. Philadelphia: J. B. 
Lippincott Co. 



a whole. It is clear and accurate, and reveals 
a good deal of solid learning. As a convenient 
handbook for the student with a technical in- 
terest, it is perhaps superior in some ways to 
any of its predecessors. An immense amount 
of information is crowded into it, and the me- 
chanical arrangement is admirable for ready 
reference. The volume includes a good sum- 
mary of Oriental thought, as well as a bird's-eye 
view of the philosophy of the present day. It is 
of course inevitable that the exposition should, 
under the circumstances, be rather bare and 
formal, and at times should be too technical to 
mean much to the untrained reader ; but for 
the most part it may be said to be as intelligible 
as the plan of the book could well admit. 

Less encyclopaedic in character, but for that 
reason much more interesting from the stand- 
point of the general reader, is Mr. Dewing's 
" Introduction to the History of Modern Phi- 
losophy." Here the primary aim is rather to 
furnish an introduction to philosophical think- 
ing than to supply a book of reference. To 
this end there is a preliminary discussion of 
philosophical terms and problems which is 
helpful ; and throughout the effort is to inter- 
pret points of view rather than merely to sum- 
marize conclusions. The writer shows himself 
to be possessed of a distinct gift for lucid ex- 
position. The sections on Berkeley and on 
Kant might perhaps be singled out as good 
examples of this skill ; the whole treatment, 
indeed, of the German Idealists is excellent, as 
an elementary introduction to a very difficult 
subject. The author concentrates attention 
almost wholly on the side of technical phi- 
losophy, and there is not much attempt to re- 
late this to the wider and less closely reasoned 
influences which enter into modern thought. 
So Rousseau, for example, is not even men- 
tioned. But in the region of philosophical 
theory, a fair degree of success is attained in 
bringing out the continuity of development ; 
and the brief introductory statements and sum- 
maries contain not a few judicious remarks. 
A summing up of present tendencies, in the 
concluding chapter, is rather more useful than 
such attempts are apt to be, and gives a pretty 
good general survey of some of the significant 
sides of contemporary thought.

Recent Fiction.* 



Some time ago a London publisher inserted ad- 
vertisements in the newspapers calling for the 
owner of a manuscript novel that had come to him 
from an anonymous source. Inclosed in a red box, 
the manuscript had been received at his office, ac- 
companied by no clue to its authorship. Mean- 
while, its publication was decided upon, and a number 
of persons were asked to suggest an appropriate 
name. By a most surprising coincidence, without 
any consultation or collusion, these persons (no 
less than seven in number) all suggested " The MS. 
in a Red Box " as a fitting title. Thus styled, the 
book is now given to the public with the benefit of 
an amount of ingenious advance advertising that 
falls to the lot of few new novels. It turns out to 
be a fairly readable romance of the conventional 
sort, which just escapes being hackneyed by the 
possession of a historical framework that has not 
heretofore, as far as we are aware, been brought 
into the novelist's service. Daring the early years 
of the reign of Charles I., some years before the 
development of the dispute about the ship money, 
the King granted to certain Dutchmen the right to 
construct drainage works in Lincolnshire for the 
purpose of reclaiming the fens. This grant aroused 
the antagonism of the inhabitants, and the men who 
were working the concession had to contend with 
an opposition that found expression in suits at law 
and in physical violence. About this situation a 
pretty story has been planned, filled with perils and 
hair-breadth escapes, and working out to the in- 
evitable pairing of the valiant English hero with 
the engaging Dutch heroine. The novel is no bet- 
ter and no worse than scores of others of its kind. 

Mr. Charles Marriott's "The Column" was a 
novel of striking freshness and individuality, and

attracted much deserved attention. It was fol- 
lowed by " Love with Honour," a very inferior 
production, which afterwards turned out to be the 
reprint of an earlier book, although this fact, un- 
fortunately for the author's reputation, was not made 
clear. Now we have " The House on the Sands," 
which we presume is a new novel. It is not a very 
pleasant performance, and contains hardly a single 
sympathetic figure. In its deliberate choice of dis- 
agreeable scenes and situations, as well as in the 
forced smartness of its diction, it reminds us a little 
of the books of " Benjamin Swift," which provide 
a certain intellectual satisfaction, but leave the emo- 
tions cold. English politics form its groundwork, 
and it is given a topical character by the fact that 
the hero is a member of the Government riding 
the hobby of imperialism. His particular scheme is 
the nationalization of the shipping interests, which 
serves as well as another for the embodiment of the 
Chamberlain type of statesmanship. The scenery 
is mostly Cornish, for that is the scenery that Mr. 
Marriott best knows, and whatever success he 
achieves is in the depiction of the scenes and char- 
acters of the tin country. At its highest, the style 
of the book comes in touch with distinction, but for 
the most part it seems strained and unreal. 

» The Yellow Crayon," by Mr. E. Phillips Op- 
penheim, is a shocker of the most pronounced sort. 
The scenes shift with bewildering rapidity, and 
there is a thrill in every chapter. They are thrills 
of melodramatic creating, as a rule, for the story 
is one of an oath-bound secret society, which resorts 
to the usual tricks for the furtherance of its ends. 
Its officers write their orders with a yellow crayon, 
which is the explanation of the title. The scene is 
first in America, but soon changes to England, 
where the society is plotting for the overthrow of a 
powerful radical leader. This is the leading mo- 
tive of the book, but many private interests come 
into play, and there is no end of excitement. The 
thing is done deftly enough, but the result is cheap 
stuff at the best. 

An awkward title — "Where Love Is" — has 
been given by Mr. W. J. Locke to his latest novel. 
The story moves in the London society of to-day, 
which the author knows well and appraises with a 
fair sense of relative values. There is much talk, 
smart or serious as the circumstances may demand, 
and natural in either case. The characters are nu- 
merous, and distinctly drawn ; indeed, Mr. Locke's 
best gift is that of characterization. The plot is 
particularly hackneyed. A young woman, trained 
all her life for husband-hunting, is about to be 
mated with a man of the most eligible description, 
from society's point of view. A most ineligible 
man, a struggling artist, appears upon the scene, 
awakens her better instincts, and finally wins her 
affections, although there is no deliberate siege on 
his part, and on hers only a dim sub-consciousness 
of what is going on until the crisis is precipitated. 
This crisis comes when she discovers that the man 
to whom she is plighted has been guilty of one of

the foulest of offenses, and that the artist has 
sought to save him by assuming the burden of the 
sin. She indignantly breaks off her engagement, 
discerns that she has loved the artist all along, and 
plans a marriage with him. By all the sentimental 
rules that govern such situations, this should be tbe 
end of the novel, or it should end with this con- 
summation clearly in view. But the author does 
not play the game fairly. Having brought us thus 
far, he abandons sentiment (which has hitherto 
been consistently worked) for realism and stern 
logic, makes his heroine suddenly revolt against 
the prospect of a life of poverty, and dismisses her 
from tbe scene as the hasty bride of a third man, 
who has before this hardly figured in the plot This 
sudden break in the natural development of the 
story is as unpardonable as it is startling, and con- 
stitutes a serious defect. Granted that the senti- 
mental theory is a convention, it is inexcusable to 
construct nine-tenths of a novel upon that basis, and 
then give us the other tenth (with the conclusion) 
upon a totally different plan. Mr. Locke's attempt 
to make this outcome seem legitimate is a miserable 
failure, and spoils what would otherwise have been 
an especially good story of its kind. 

The peculiar blend of public and private inter- 
ests that is characteristic of the life of our national 
capital has been found attractive by a number of 
novelists, although the possibilities of the subject 
are as yet far from having been exhausted. The 
anonymous author of " Despotism and Democ- 
racy " is the latest experimenter in this field of 
fiction, and his work is singularly delicate in its 
expression and singularly penetrating in its analy- 
sis of tbe social and political forces that actuate 
men and women in Washington society. It is 
clearly the work of a first-hand observer, for it 
avoids the pitfalls that await anyone working in 
this material speculatively and at a distance. The 
contrast between the theory and the practice of the 
Federal Government can be understood only by the 
observer at close range, and a theoretical study of 
the documents, unsupplemented by direct observa- 
tion, is sure to result in a hopelessly distorted pic- 
ture. In its private aspect, this novel is by no 
means thrilling, for its characters are all elderly 
people who think well before they act, and do not 
permit passion to blur their vision. They are gen- 
uine individuals of interestingly varied types, actu- 
ated by motives which, whether mean or generous, 
find their full warrant in the facts of average hu- 
man nature. They include several men in high 
political positions, who do not seem to be actual 
characters in disguise, although the temptation to 
find for them such identification is now and then 
strong. A certain amount of composite construc- 
tion from actual life may perhaps be admitted ; 
more than this it would be rash to assume. 

Mr. Jack London has certainly done a clever 
and appealing piece of work in " The Call of the 
Wild," which must rank high among animal stories 
and, pace Mr. Burroughs, is made sufficiently con- 



vincing to dull skepticism while it is being read. 
Doubts arise afterwards, and they are probably 
legitimate, but while the spell of the story is upon 
us, we are willing to allow that a dog may have the 
complex inner life which is here depicted. For 
the hero of this book is a dog, and the human be- 
ings who appear are of only secondary importance. 
He is a dog kidnapped from his home in Califor- 
nia, where he has led an easy and irresponsible 
life, to be broken into the service of sled-hauling 
in Alaska. He makes many trips over the deso- 
late Northern trails, falling in succession to several 
masters, and shows himself equal to all emergen- 
cies. And all these experiences, while they harden 
his muscles and develop his adaptiveness to new 
conditions, are at the same time working power- 
fully to bring out the slumbering instincts of his 
wolfish ancestry ; he hears " the call of the wild " 
more and more distinctly, and civilization gradu- 
ally drops away from him, until in the end, the 
last and best of his masters having been slain by 
the Indians, he abandons civilization for good, and 
joins the wolf-pack, of which his strength and craft 
at once make him the leader. The story is cer- 
tainly an impressive one, made so by the author's 
insight into canine nature, and by the infusion of 
much poetical feeling. Mr. London has not a lit- 
tle of the magic which makes " The Jungle Book " 
almost the best of Mr. Kipling's writings. 

Mr. Robert W. Chambers has a pretty taste in 
titles. " The Maids of Paradise'' is almost as alluring 
as " Ashes of Empire," but it does not fit the subject 
matter quite as well. Paradise is a Breton village, 
and its maids are mostly legendary. There is one 
maid, however, the heroine, who is a very real per- 
son, and a charming one. She is the Countess de 
Yassart, and a dreamer. She becomes the tool of 
an unscrupulous agitator, who poses in her presence 
as an apostle of universal brotherhood, and who is 
really a leader of the Reds of Belleville, and a 
master spirit of the Internationale. For the story 
is of the war between France and Prussia, a matter 
with which Mr. Chambers has already proved his 
acquaintance in the series of three romances which 
are probably his best. The hero in the present in- 
stance is an American going by the name of Scar- 
lett. We never learn what his real name is, for 
when he reveals it in the end, it is only in a whis- 
pered communication to the Countess. He is first 
an officer of the Imperial Police, and in that ca- 
pacity takes part in the early frontier operations of 
the war, and, among other things, rescues the he- 
roine and discomfits the villain. Afterwards, dis- 
missed from the service, and forced to disguise 
himself, he joins an American circus traveling in 
France, and acts as lion-tamer. The scene is then 
transferred to Paradise, and the interest centres in 
a plot, engineered by the villain, to capture the 
crown treasures that have been sent to the Breton 
coast for safety. Amid much excitement the vil- 
lain is thwarted, while hero and heroine come to 
the usual understanding. The story is a capital

one, full of vivid action, and colored with the poet- 
ry of genuine romance. May the author give us 
many more of the kind, and increase the debt of 
our gratitude to him for wholesome and stirring en- 
tertainment. 

"The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come" is the 
quaint but not infelicitous title of a new story by 
Mr. John Fox, Jr., the longest that he has thus far 
written. The scene is Kentucky, the time that of 
the Civil War and the years preceding. The ele- 
ments of the story are all familiar : there is the 
ambitious boy struggling for education in a rude 
and uncouth environment, there is the clash of pas- 
sionate opinion incident to tbe outbreak of tbe 
Great Rebellion, there are the inevitable family 
divisions and personal estrangements, there is the 
Southern heroine indignant at the course of the hero 
in becoming a Union soldier, tbere are the battle 
scenes and the opportunities they afford for mutual 
services on tbe part of the friends in the opposed 
camps, and there is the chastened conclusion and 
reconciliation. All these things, of course, have 
been described many times before, but rarely with 
equal charm and poetic sentiment. Specifically, 
the story reflects the war as it was felt in a Border 
State, where it was harder to bear than elsewhere 
because of the intimate ties which it was sure to 
sunder, and in this respect Mr. Fox has given us a 
fair counterpart of what was given us by Mr. 
Churchill in "The Crisis." The most important 
historical figure is that of John Morgan the raider, 
whose dashing career provides many picturesque 
and dramatic incidents. The first part of the book, 
describing the hero's boyhood, is the best; the war 
part is too confused to be wholly successful. But 
whatever its defects, the book is one that does 
marked credit to its author, and insures for him 
henceforth a position the promise of which was 
held out by his earlier work, although the fullfil- 
ment has been long delayed. 

Still another Civil War story, in its main outline 
running curiously parallel to the one just discussed, 
is "The Vagabond," by Mr. Frederick Palmer. 
Here again is an orphan hero, a runaway in child- 
hood, who becomes a man and a soldier, fights on 
the Union side through the four years of strife, and 
wins the love of the Southern heroine after the 
neccessary difficulties and misunderstandings. He 
starts life somewhere in New England, and reaches 
the field of warfare after a detour to California 
with the forty-niners. Mr. Palmer has been more 
successful with his war scenes than Mr. Fox, and 
his account of Bull Bun is particularly well done. 
Tbe later scenes take in the Shenandoah and the 
final operations about Richmond. On the other 
hand, Mr. Palmer's style is not nearly so good as 
that of Mr. Fox; it is often careless and some- 
times difficult. The "vagabond" hero is a very 
engaging youth in all the stages of his career; his 
straightforward ingenuousness makes friends for 
him both within and without the book, and serves 
him far better than either subtlety or craft would 



have done. This quality is combined with the 
qualities of self-confidence and determination, and 
the combination proves equal to the most stubborn 
occasions. Among the countless stories of the 
Civil War that have thus far been written, the two 
we have just described must be set very near the 
top of the list. 

Mr. Henry Burnham Boone, who has written 
two Virginia novels in conjunction with Mr. Ken- 
neth Brown, now gives us, in " The Career Tri- 
umphant," a book that is wholly his own. It is a 
breezy book, with no pretensions to style, telling its 
story pleasantly, and from an intimate acquaintance 
with the ways of Virginians. The heroine is a tal- 
ented girl who makes for herself a "career triumph- 
ant" upon the stage, and the conflict between her 
ambition and her love keeps the story going until 
it has attained the dimensions necessary to a self- 
respecting novel. This feat is accomplished by a 
resort to the old device of the misunderstanding 
which keeps the lovers apart for several years. It 
is hard to imagine what our novelists would do if 
they had not this trick to fall back upon, or if their 
readers were suddenly to lose interest in persons 
who, otherwise sensible and intelligent, are repre- 
sented as capable of this particular sort of foolish- 
ness where their chief interests are concerned. 

"The Millionaire's Son," by Mrs. Anna Robe- 
son Brown, has for its scene a university town in 
New England. The university is named Chilling- 
worth, and corresponds to no actual institution, al- 
though there is now and then a possible suggestion 
of either Williams or Brown. The principal char- 
acter is a young man born to wealth (as the title 
indicates) but inheriting a marked intellectual bent, 
presumably from his grandfather, who is a delight- 
ful figure of a belated transcendentalism keeping his 
soul alive on the spiritual memories of New En- 
gland's golden age. The young man honestly at- 
tempts to meet his father's wishes, and devote him- 
self to the business operations which have prospered 
so exceedingly in the hands of the older man. But 
the scholarly impulse proves too strong for him, and 
his course is eventually decided by his successful 
competition for a university scholarship, offered by 
an unknown benefactor, and providing a generous 
income for its recipient. It turns out that his father 
is the unknown donor, but the prize has been fairly 
won, and the son accepts it, together with the con- 
sequence of being cut off from the family fortunes. 
A suitable heroine is provided, who finally yields 
because of this sacrifice, and who is an altogether 
charming and high-minded young woman. The es- 
sence of the book is found in this conflict between 
the lower and the higher motive, and the narrative 
is informed throughout by a true and healthy ideal- 
ism. It is, moreover, an exceptionally well-written 
and interesting story, with much variety of charac- 
ter and incident, and many happy bits of detail. 
It reflects some things that are not pleasant, such 
as the snobbishness of a society in which the Brah- 
min caste persists, and the commercial conception

THE DIAL,

of a university sometimes held by its trustees, bat 
these things are true, and belong to the picture. 

Curiously enough, a second novel coming to us 
at the same time is also concerned with the life of 
a university town, and is, like the other, the work 
of a woman. In "The Law of Life," by Miss 
Anna McClure Sholl, the university stands out as a 
distinctly-drawn portrait of Cornell, although the 
characters are not particularly suggestive of actual 
person?. In this novel, the interests of the University 
occupy the entire ground, and the traits of its deni- 
zens are portrayed with peculiar intimacy. The tone 
of its special combination of social and academic 
life is caught with surprising success — the narrow- 
ness of the intellectual horizon, the interrelations 
of a small society thrown almost wholly on its own 
resources, and the momentous significance assumed 
by petty questions of rank, and promotion, and com- 
pensation. The exaggerated self-consciousness of 
the student body of such an institution has often 
been exhibited in tales of college life ; the present 
work gives us as a counterpart the special type of 
equally exaggerated self-consciousness developed in 
the members of the teaching body and their wives. 
The one broad question raised which involves a 
principle of ethics is that of the attitude of a uni- 
versity toward the would-be benefactor of dubious 
reputation. In this case his name is John Rebbor 
(a name better understood when spelled backwards) 
and he offers an endowment of millions on condition 
of being made a trustee. The single scene in which 
he appears in person is remarkably well done. The 
outcome of the gift is the triumph of the president's 
worldly wisdom, and the dismissal of the young in- 
structor who has led the opposition. We have said 
nothing thus far to account for the title of the book, 
which has also its aspect as a study of genuine hu- 
man passion. This same young instructor has for 
his chief a middle-aged and absent-minded professor 
of mathematics. And this same professor has for a 
ward a shy and unsophisticated maiden who comes 
to college knowing much of books but nothing of 
life. The guardian finds it pleasant to have her 
about, and asks her to marry him, which she con- 
sents to do. After the wedding, he returns to his 
problems, and leaves her to amuse herself. Mean- 
while, the young instructor discovers that he loves 
her, and she, gradually awakening to the meaning 
of womanhood, finds out to her horror that she is 
far more deeply interested in the younger than in 
the older man. Then follow the usual struggles and 
temptations, but her Puritan conscience wins the 
victory, and the moral law — " the law of life " — 
is vindicated. In proportion as she rises in our 
esteem the man sinks, and he gets much the lesser 
share of our sympathy when in the end he goes 
forth into the world to begin life over again. The 
author of this novel is to be congratulated upon a 
performance that is far above the average in artistic 
and ethical quality. 

"The Castle of Twilight," by Miss Margaret 
Horton Potter (Mrs. Black), is a somewhat slighter 



performance than the earlier books of this talented 
writer, but exhibits, if anything, an advance in lit- 
erary skill. It is, in a sense, a historical romance 
of the days of feudalism, and seeks especially to 
portray the conditions under which women of noble 
birth lived their lives in those far-off days. There 
are no adventures worth speaking of, and no spec- 
tacular dramatic situations, but there is instead a 
deeply sympathetic portrayal of the conditions of 
every-day domestic existence in a Breton castle, 
remote from the world in which arms clash and 
passions rule. There are passions, to be sure, in 
the existence of these secluded women, but they are 
subdued in tone, and their tragic issue is softened. 
The book has many tender and graceful pages, and 
in place of excitement offers us that elusive quality 
which we call atmosphere for lack of a more definite 
characterization. The title is happily suggestive of 
the melancholy and even sombre tone of the entire 
composition. 

Historical romance of a very different sort, 
sprightly (too sprightly), stirring, and filled with a 
certain sort of actuality, is given us by Miss Myrtle 
Reed in * The Shadow of Victory," a story of Fort 
Dearborn and the Indian massacre which marks 
the entrance of early Chicago into spectacular his- 
tory. The story was clamoring for treatment, and 
Miss Reed has done fairly well with it, although 
the material is thin and requires to be eked out by 
many trivialities. As a whole, it has neither depth 
of insight nor strength of grasp, but it keeps the in- 
terest awake, and the climax, when at last reached, 
is vigorously presented. The horror of that August 
day, when the devoted little band of whites started 
for the Fort Wayne trail, knowing that they were 
advancing to as sure a fate (and one more horrible) 
as that which faced the heroic Spanish sailors at 
Santiago, is depicted with perhaps as much of ro- 
mantic coloring as is admissible without departing 
far from the recorded facts.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



Interpretations of the life of a Western millionaire 
resident in New York form the theme of Mr. William 
Dean Howells's " Letters Home " ( Harper) . The daugh- 
ter of a rich man writes to a girl friend in Iowa; a 
yonng man with literary ambitions writes to the editor 
of the local paper; his friend, an employee of the rich 
man, writes to his brother, the clergyman in the town; 
the secretary and companion of the rich man's daughter 
writes to her mother in Central New York; and a 
Boston man of leisure sends word of his impressions of 
them all to his sister-in-law in New England. The 
book affords proof of Mr. Howells's earlier statement 
that practically all Americans, in or out of cities, are 
country born and bred; and so of the corollary that 
they are pretty much at heart the same sort of human 
beings. The complicated little romance in the letters 
might quite as well have worked itself out in the Iowa 
home of most of the characters, the enormous wealth 
being too recently acquired to have hardened the hearts

of its possessors. The nice differentiation of individ- 
ualities which is so entirely Mr. Howells's may be seen 
here at its best, especially his understanding of the 
feminine mind which relates him to Anthony Trollope. 
Of the three latest works of fiction from this distin- 
guished hand, this is perhaps the most generally inter- 
esting. 

In her new book, slight as it is in volume, Miss Alice 
Brown proves anew her right to rank with the best 
American writers of fiction. " Judgment " (Harper) is 
so brief it must be called a novelette. Its protagonist 
is the wife of a man of the largest commercial affairs, 
governed by a severe sense of justice to which, presum- 
ably, he has in turn sacrificed his son, his daughter, and 
is on the point of sacrificing all his employees when the 
story begins. As a matter of spiritual fact, it is the wife 
whom he loves so passionately and tenderly who has 
been the real, if vicarious, sacrifice on every occasion. 
She is engaged, after the manner of wholly unselfish 
womanhood, in attempting to keep her son's affianced 
wife from a sorrow that rises from his past as well, and 
comes within a little of giving up her love in the deed. 
Her danger awakens her husband to the truth which 
his daughter forces upon him, and the book concludes 
simply, after dealing with the most subtle of human 
motives. It is a worthy piece of literature in every 
respect. 

One notes an unusually large proportion of novels of 
the day in which either the hero, the heroine, or both, 
are far past the first flush of youth. In some of these 
books there is unquestionably the reflection of an age of 
growing luxury in which matrimony is deferred until a 
high standard of living can be maintained. In others 
it is probably due to the writer's advancing age on one 
side, and to the late coming into the leisure necessary 
for the indulgence of the reading habit on the other. 
Whatever the reason, Miss Eliza Orne White's " Leslie 
Chilton " (Houghton) is unusual, even among its kind, 
in making the hero an elderly widower with several 
children, who gains and keeps the affection of a girl 
through his intellectual and moral worth. By way of 
compensating disadvantages, the young woman is an 
ardent advocate of equal political rights for her sex, a 
fact which leads to her acquaintance with her true love, 
and, through the curious medium of a public debate on 
the question, to their better knowledge of one another. 
Their marriage under the circumstances is in some- 
thing of the nature of an armed neutrality. Slight as 
the materials for romance are in such a story, Miss 
White has made the most of them, never falling below 
an assured if mild degree of interest. 

Among the serious works of art put forth in the 
guise of the historical novel, " Gorgo, a Romance of 
Old Athens" (Lothrop) shows not only an adequate 
conception of the story-teller's function, but a close 
knowledge of the time and country treated, and their 
availability for the purposes of romance. The author 
is Professor Charles K. Gaines, Ph.D., of the St. 
Lawrence University; and it is unnecessary to add that 
his chair is that of Greek. Here the great deeds and 
sorrows of the Athenians in the days of Pericles unroll 
before the reader's eyes. The overthrow in Sicily, 
with the death of Socrates, — the saddest episode in 
Grecian history, — finds its due place in the narrative ; 
and no higher praise can be awarded than to say that 
the English account leaves an adequate impression of 
the disaster as we know it from Thucydides. The 
illustrations, by Mr. George Varian, really illustrate 



the text, and the book is handsome in outward form. 

An artless story of the Maine woods, and of a little 
settlement on their verge and far from a railway, will 
be found in " The Hermit " (Lee & Shepard), by Mr. 
Charles Clark Munn. At almost a single stroke, a 
young man who has left the town and made his fortune 
in the great world puts himself in the way of regaining 
his boyhood's sweetheart and of clearing up a mystery 
that has harrowed the community for many years. In 
a remote nook of the great forest that stretches over 
Maine and British America to the eastward, he chances 
upon the strange old fellow who gives title to the story, 
and who proves to be the co-heir to the large property 
that has been amassed by the town miser. A rude sort 
of poetic justice is dealt this sordid old man through 
the instrumentality of a small boy he has deeply and 
doubly wronged. Apart from this, the book is a peace- 
ful and happy one, with many well-defined personalities 
in its pages, — that of the narrator, conventionalized by 
contact with wider interests, being the most poorly 
defined of them all. 

The "labor question" fills a large share of the pleas- 
ant story told by Miss Mary Moss under the title of 
" A Sequence in Hearts " (Lippincott), one of the lead- 
ing characters being the owner and operator of an 
anthracite mine. The difference in a business personally 
conducted as this is, and of one in the hands of an 
impersonal and soulless corporation, is well marked. 
But the real meaning of the story, as its nam* suggests, 
is to be found in the manner in which a young man gets 
on with a new love after he is off with the old. This, it 
is true, leaves the most fascinating personality in the 
story without even the shadow of a consolation, — rather 
a striking defect in such a story; but it is well worked 
out with this exception, and promises favorably for 
Miss Moss's future in literature. 

Sixteen tales, each complete in itself, make up the 
contents of Mrs. Elia W. Peattie's volume entitled " The 
Edge of Things " (Revell). All of them have to do with 
the confines of American civilization, most of them hav- 
ing their scene laid in the Southwest, where the shep- 
herd has succeeded to the cowboy, but some of them 
carrying the tale on to the Klondike region. Practically 
the same persons appear and reappear in the entire 
series, working out a number of distinct romances. The 
strength of Mrs. Peattie's writing lies largely in her 
ability to correlate the spiritual life of her people with 
their surroundings, and she has here sought to accom- 
plish for the sheep rancher what she has previously done 
for the dweller in the Western mountains, and the 
farmer on the prairies of the Mississippi valley. 

Mrs. George C. Biggs (Kate Douglas Wiggin) brings 
to her " Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm " (Houghton) the 
same delightful play of wit that animated her tales of 
foreign travel ; and her story is the pleasantest possible 
reading in consequence. It follows the fortune of a 
spirited and mischievous little girl, through her school 
graduation into her work as teacher in one of the bleak- 
est parts of New England — bleakest in both a material 
and spiritual sense. A man of means and cultivation 
comes into her life very early, and at the close of the 
book bids fair to remain in it until the end. Rebecca 
can be depended upon to endear herself to the reader 
long before the story is done, and the general impression 
left by the book is one of gratefulness to the author. 

A pretty little study of Provence at the height of its 
literary fame has been made by Mrs. Julia de Wolf 
Addison in " Florestane the Troubadour, a Mediaeval 



1903.]

Romance of Southern France " (Estes). The courts of 
love, the contests of the trouveres, the lawlessness of 
the barons, the power of the Church, the superstitions 
regarding witches and their arts, and the splendor of 
the aristocracy, all have due place in the foreground, 
and are of the essence of romance. If any valid criti- 
cism is to be urged against the book, it is to the effect 
that the actors are not quite human enough, their deeds 
and words being as remote as their surroundings. The 
introduction of Cimabue, Sordello, and Dante, among 
the characters, is well carried off, once it is granted 
that the two last named are dragged in by the heels, so 
to speak. 

Following his curious tales of " Captain Kettle," Mr. 
Cutcliffe Hyne has found scope for his wide knowledge 
of the sea and its servants in another series grouped 
under the name of their narrator, "McTodd" (Mac- 
millan). Kettle, it will be remembered, was a reli- 
gionary of a pronounced Protestant type; McTodd is a 
Scotchman of views equally pronounced, but differing 
widely from his predecessor in manifesting his Cal- 
vinistic bias only when under the influence of much 
liquor. His adventures are in the Arctic zone for 
the most part, with some divergences into equatorial 
Africa. He is an engineer of a sort, and an interesting 
though wholly unlovable person. The book abounds 
in humor, sometimes of a rather broad and sailorlike 
flavor; and it is pleasant to read for those who like ad- 
venture and the sea. 

There is always a placid sort of interest and whole- 
someness attaching to Miss Rosa Nouchette Carey's 
stories, which can be perused without fear of their 
bringing a blush to the cheek of the most innocent, 
making them very safe reading for the young lady of 
the United Kingdom and the United States. In " A 
Passage Perilous " (Lippincott) Miss Carey has gone 
as far toward extremes as is possible with her, her 
heroine marrying an officer in the British army after a 
mere shred of a courtship, leaving him at the church 
door immediately after the ceremony in compliance 
with orders taking him to the war just breaking in 
South Africa. Love was practically out of the ques- 
tion between them, but the dangers he suffers bring 
about their customary Othello-like effect, — the attain- 
ment of a modus vivendi with his mother occupying most 
of the narrative between her husband's departure and 
return. 

There is little attempt to portray the reconstructed 
Southerner in Miss Elizabeth Bisland's "A Candle of 
Understanding" (Harper), the story opening, just at the 
close of the war between the States, on a sugar planta- 
tion in Louisiana, with its proprietor in failing circum- 
stances. It is told by his daughter, a tiny girl at the 
outset, and follows her hard and unlovely life, until, 
years after, she achieves success on the metropolitan 
stage. The story is exceedingly well told, with a fine 
humor and an outline both delicate and firm. While 
the book says almost nothing about a reunited country, 
its entire trend is such that it cannot help bringing about 
a better comprehension and sympathy, so far as the 
South, both old and new, is concerned; and the few 
touches dealing with the Southern negro make to the 
same end. 

Americans of the Michigan and Wisconsin lumber 
regions, little known to readers of modern novels, crowd 
the pages of Mr. Samuel Merwin's sympathetic and 
delightful " Story of Hunch Badeau," or as its chief title 
gives it, " His Little World " (Barnes). Whether the 



book is laid down with the feeling that its hero is con- 
ventionally American or not, it will surely be found 
that he is of his own place and time, and that, however 
uncouth, the author has here drawn the figure of a manly 
man. His career is that of captain of a lumber schooner 
trafficking on the Great Lakes, and involves many stir- 
ring episodes, including the loss of his vessel in a heavy 
gale. Mr. Merwin shows himself master of his mate- 
rials, and few books more convincingly realistic have 
been written. 

Mr. Roswell Field has written his third graceful story 
and called it " The Bondage of Ballinger " (Revell). 
It will recall his brother Eugene's " Love Affairs of a 
Bibliomaniac " in its choice of subject matter, the hero 
of it being himself an ardent lover of rare editions of 
worthy books. He is, moreover, a man of small means, 
a printer by trade, who keeps himself and his patient 
wife in poverty through his inability to withstand tempt- 
ation such as ordinarily besets the bibliophile. Fortu- 
nately for himself and the world, the charming old 
fellow undertakes to teach a youthful neighbor, only 
daughter of a merchant prince, what it is in books that 
is so engrossing; and in later life it is she who acts as 
his preserver, — more than that, as the preserver of his 
darling library. It requires both skill and courage to 
write a serene, placid, affectionately disposed story like 
this, in which there are no unworthy passions and none 
of what the modern reader calls " love interest." 

Since the use by Miss Molly Elliot Seawell of the 
word " sprightly " in one of her romances, no word has 
been as fit for their characterization as a whole. And 
of none of them is it any more apt than of "The 
Fortunes of Fifi" (Bobbs-Merrill). Given a bright 
and pretty little Italian girl, adopted as a Parisian by 
an old soldier of the Empire, make them both actors in 
a little Parisian theatre, give her the Pope for an uncle 
and him the friendship of the great Napoleon himself, 
and it is evident that all that happens must be inter- 
esting to dwellers in times and under skies less romantic 
than those that are here depicted. 

It required considerable daring for Mr. Roland 
Burnbam Molineux to seize upon the notorious amour 
between Lady Hamilton and Lord Nelson as the basis 
of " The Vice Admiral of the Blue " (Dillingham), and 
almost as mnch to put the story in the mouth of 
Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, Bart., Nelson's 
devoted friend and the receiver of his dying request. 
There is, of course, no reason why, if the facts are as 
they are here reported, they should be suppressed in 
order to leave the figure of England's greatest seaman 
as immaculate as it is heroic; but when doubt so grave 
exists, as in the case of the entire series of episodes at 
the court of Naples, it is hardly fair to set them down 
as they are told here, without any question of their 
actuality. The rest of the story is intensely interesting, 
and is told with more than ordinary skill. 

It is a far cry to the Southwestern frontier when the 
army was still engaged in keeping peace between the 
aborigines and the settlers, but few books have the 
wealth of detail and of action utilized by General Charles 
King in "An Apache Princess" (The Hobart Co.). 
The various mysterious crimes that bring on an uprising 
of the Indians, and keep the garrison in a state of gos- 
sip, scandal, and turmoil, are very ingeniously contrived 
for holding the interest of the reader from cover to 
cover. The effect is somewhat melodramatic, though 
convincing as a whole. At the core of it all is a very 
pretty love-story.

Briefs on New Books. 



The fourth and concluding volume 
VgXZZ °* ^e Cheyne-Black « Encyclopaedia 

Biblica" (Macmillan) has appeared. 
It is distinctly and avowedly the most complete ex- 
ponent of the radical school of Biblical criticism 
yet published. Its staff of contributors includes 
some of the extremists both in the Old and New 
Testament fields. Professor Cheyne himself leads 
the van in speculative and critical theories touching 
the Old Testament. This volume maintains the 
standard of its three predecessors, and, like the 
third, ventures out into the realm of Biblical the- 
ology. There are several notable articles whose 
titles and authors at least merit mention. Profes- 
sor Schniedel of Zurich contributes three long 
articles on " Resurrection and Ascension-Narra- 
tives," "Spiritual Gifts," and "Simon Peter," — 
all of them permeated with the same spirit and 
method that characterized his contributions in 
earlier volumes of the work. Professor van Manen 
of Leyden has written on " Romans." A single 
sentence may point out his position on one point: 
"What is certain, at any rate, is that the canonical 
epistle [Romans] is not by Paul" (col. 4141). 
"Sacrifice," by Professor G. F. Moore of Harvard, 
is a well prepared and comprehensive article. Pro- 
fessor F. C Barkitt contributes a most helpful 
treatment of " Text and Versions." " Trade and 
Commerce," by Professor George Adam Smith, is 
an elaborate treatment on the basis of the latest 
discoveries in the inscriptions of the Orient, illus- 
trated by three useful maps. There are three other 
maps of exceptional value, illustrating or locating 
ancient and modern places. A new map of 
" Trachonitis, Bashan, Hauran, Golan, etc.," de- 
scribes by colors the elevations of that newly sur- 
veyed district of Palestine. But the treatment of 
proper names is a more marked idiosyncrasy of this 
than of previous volumes. Professor Cheyne's 
"Jerahmeel" derivation for hundreds of these 
names is here reduced to a veritable absurdity. 
The most valuable and permanent contributions to 
this volume are those articles that deal with themes 
archaeological and geographical. The radically 
critical positions will, of course, prove to be evan- 
escent and temporary. We congratulate the edi- 
tors on the completion of this great work. 

Of real interest, and real value too, 
ojapoet" 9 *° a ^ Wordsworthians is the volume 

on Wordsworth by Professor Walter 
Raleigh (Longmans). The value of this mono- 
graph of 232 pages lies in the reasonableness of 
its author's method and in the frank directness of 
his manner. " A criticism of a poet that omits all 
reference to his failures is as futile a thing as a 
biography of a great soldier that passes in silence 
over his defeats." That Professor Raleigh is sym- 
pathetic as well as dispassionate appears, however, 
at the start. " Of Wordsworth in particular it is 



hardly true to say that his strength and weakness 
are closely knit up together ; rather, they are the 
same ; his strength at its best is weakness made 
perfect, his weakness is the wasteful ebullition of 
his strength." This study of the poet is critical in 
the sense of being interpretative. Wordsworth's 
cause most readers will consider already judged; 
" but there will always remain a certain curious 
minority of the human race whose desire is not so 
much to judge a poet as to understand him." In 
the process of attempting thus to "explain" the 
poet, primary importance is laid upon the confes- 
sions and assertions of "The Prelude," which is 
made conspicuous throughout the book as oar most 
significant source of information concerning the 
development of the poet in the man. Wordsworth's 
childhood and education are studied in the opening 
chapter; the influences of the French Revolution 
and the notable benefits of the intercourse with 
Coleridge are discussed in the second. We wish 
that this last-mentioned theme could have received 
more extended treatment ; a thorough study of the 
relations between these poets would be indeed a wel- 
come contribution to our acquaintance with both. 
Other chapters follow, upon Wordsworth's poetic 
diction, his attitude toward Nature, his feeling for 
Humanity, and upon his experiences of illumina- 
tion. But Professor Raleigh's book is something 
more than a mere attempt to interpret Wordsworth; 
his purpose expands with the study until we realize 
that this particular poet is being analyzed as a type 
of his genus; and the processes by which this boy, 
roaming the hills of Cumberland and Westmore- 
land, venturesome, passionate, headstrong, and 
heedless, grew into the sedate, contemplative inter- 
preter of 

" The Being that is in the clouds and air," 
are taken to be Nature's processes by which all 
poets born are matured into the poets who really 
are. Whether Professor Raleigh's readers gain 
much actual knowledge of the mystery from his 
efforts to elucidate the secret, perhaps does not mat- 
ter; they certainly owe him their thanks for a vol- 
ume of unusual interest in the field of personal 
interpretation, agreeable in style, and full of helpful 
and illuminating thought. 

Contemporary letters often correct 
the appearance of fixedness which 
the historical narrative inevitably 
gives to events. The drama revealed in them does 
not move on with the usual well-considered em- 
phasis of each element of the plot ; there is some- 
thing of the real confusion of the events them- 
selves. But reasoning like this is not required to 
encourage the reading of the letters of the Baron- 
ess Bonde (James Pott & Co.), written amidst the 
surprises and the disillusionment* of the Revolu- 
tion of 1848. The writer of the letters was at 
that time Miss Robinson, the daughter of an Irish 
baronet who had lived in Paris since 1819. Her 
long acquaintance among influential persons, diplo-

mats, and others, gave a special value to her letters, 
and they were at once appreciated by the English 
friends into whose hands they fell. Even " the 
Duke of Wellington and Lord Palmerston were 
said to have clamoured for them." This is not to 
be wondered at, for althongh occasionally they 
seem full of the echoes of distrust and discourage- 
ment which fly through the air in Revolutionary 
days, they portray vividly the movement of senti- 
ment in certain social strata during that strange 
spring and summer. Often they contain descrip- 
tions which must have been of great interest to the 
Englishmen who were familiar with every foot of 
Paris, and who could follow Miss Robinson in her 
venturesome tours of exploration through the dis- 
ordered streets. The description of the Boule- 
vards just after the overthrow of Louis Philippe, 
and the description of the Rue St. Antoine after 
the terrible fighting in June, are particularly 
well drawn. The latter, especially, deserves to be 
compared with some of the finest pictures in Toc- 
queville's Recollections, which is saying a good deal 
for it. For such passages as these, for the evi- 
dence scattered over the pages of the rapid pas- 
sing of great reputations like that of Lamartine, 
the letters have value also for the historical stu- 
dent, although he will not attach much weight to 
rumors which the salons took for realities. The 
book is provided with historical notes and a brief 
introduction by the editor, Miss Constance E. Warr. 

The high tone and fresh enthusiasm 
*3/i£, ^own by Mr. Henry Dwight Sedg- 

wick, Jr., in his "Essays on Great 
Writers " ( Houghton ), cannot fail to give pleasure. 
Romance, chivalry, the love of one woman, the joy 
of combat, the glory of death in a good cause, the 
final triumph of the right — in all these he strength- 
ens our belief, and helps us to see that books which 
tend to lessen our respect for the idols of our youth 
are not the best literature. Thackeray comes in for 
his share of condemnation, because he " has no 
faith ; he does not entertain high expectations. His 
characters do shameless things, and Thackeray says 
to the reader, 'Be not surprised, injured-seeming 
friend; you would have done the like under the like 
temptation.' " With a keen appreciation of d' An- 
nunzio's marvellous literary skill, he declares against 
him in no uncertain terms: "We do not believe 
that a novel of the first rank can be made out of 
the materials at d'Annunzio's command. Instead 
of humor he has scorn and sneer ; in place of con- 
science he gives us swollen egotism ; for the deep 
affections he proffers lust." In his chapter on 
Lockhart's Scott Mr. Sedgwick suggests the substi- 
tution of biography for Greek composition or even 
solid geometry in the school curriculum. This 
essay, though written to call attention toa- River- 
side " edition of the Life of Scott, sends us with 
such renewed zest to the Waverleys, that we can- 
not call it hack-work. Other chapters deal with 
Montaigne, Macaulay, Don Quixote, and "En- 



glish and French Literature," besides the subjects 
already referred to. Wide scholarship, insight, 
imagination, and humor are found in these pleasant 
and instructive papers, which are chiefly reprints 
from the " Atlantic" A wealth of apt and erudite 
quotation points the moral. " The child is father to 
the man " ( page 23 ) seems, like " All that glitters is 
not gold," and many other popular misquotations, 
more than likely to hold its own against the correct 
reading. 

Ruskin's " Letters to M. G. and H. 
by 'euMh. U ™ W (Harper) show him in a mood, 

now tender, now playful, that will 
be new to most of his readers. The initials mani- 
festly stand for Mr. Gladstone's daughters Mary 
and Helen. It was in the seventh decade of Rus- 
kin's life, and the eighth of Gladstone's, that the 
two met for the first time at Hawarden, not long 
after Ruskin's tart reply to the Liberals of Glas- 
gow, rather comically disclaiming any more regard 
for either Gladstone or Disraeli than for two old 
bagpipes blown by steam. Despite the violent con- 
trast in all respects between guest and host, they 
conceived a warm admiration for each other, and 
remained true friends. For Mary Gladstone Rus- 
kin cherished a tender affection, addressing her in 
his letters as " my darling little Madonna," " dar- 
ling Mary," "my dear little Mother," "you darling 
little Mother," etc. This prodigal expenditure of 
endearments, which might indicate dotage in an- 
other, serves rather as a pathetic reminder in his 
case of the life barren of domestic joys that it was 
his lot to lead. To Carlyle, his acknowledged 
" master," he was wont to write in terms of almost 
equal tenderness, calling him " dearest Papa," and 
signing himself, " ever your faithful and loving 
son " — as is shown in a letter written in 1878, 
and quoted by Mr. George Wyndham in his pre- 
face to the present volume. Two short papers by 
Canon Scott Holland are appended, treating of 
"Ruskin and Gladstone," and "The Dead Rus- 
kin." A profile view of Ruskin in his old age, and 
an exquisite pencil sketch of Mary Gladstone by 
Burne-Jones, embellish the little book, which all 
sincere lovers of Ruskin will heartily welcome. To 
others it will be as a gift of almonds to the tooth- 
less. 

" The Aftermath ; or, Gleanings from

cover, for purposes of sale, Caliban's

title-page of an amusing skit by Mr. Hilaire Bel- 
loc, published by Messrs. Dutton & Co. An intro- 
duction gives a personal account of the mythical Dr. 
Caliban, a man of solemn platitudes and impressive 
mediocrity ; and then follow practical chapters upon 
such phases of the literary craft as reviewing, the 
short lyric, the interview, and the personal par., 
all based upon the most correct Philistine principles, 
and illustrated by examples of the literary forms 
in question. We quote a model "personal par." as

an example of Mr. Belloc's quiet humor: "It is 
not generally known that the late Lord Grumble- 
tooth rose from the ranks. His lordship was a 
singularly reticent man, and the matter is still 
shrouded in obscurity. He was, however, a politi- 
cian in the best sense of the word, and owed his ad- 
vancement to the virtues that have made England 
famous. The collection of domestic china at 
Grumbletooth House will vie with any other col- 
lection at any similar house in the Kingdom." Mr. 
Belloc's fun is never boisterous, but it raises many 
a quiet chuckle ; and his satire, if subdued, is for 
that all the more deadly. We commend particu- 
larly the note on the five canons of effective style, 
and the following injunction cannot be taken too 
seriously : " As to the practice, which has recently 
grown up, of writing only when one is drunk, or of 
introducing plain lies into every sentence, they are 
quite unworthy of the stylist properly so-called, and 
can never permanently add to one's reputation." 
We also call special attention to the " opinions of the 
press," the "errata and addenda," and the index. 
It is not every man who can make an index hu- 
morous. 

The absence of any complete manual 
iSSrSS <>f Nor t h American game birds is 

cited by Mr. Dwight W. Huntington 
as the occasion for the preparation of his volume on 
"Our Feathered Game" (Scribner). As the title 
indicates, this is a book for sportsmen. It is written 
by a successful and enthusiastic hunter, and from 
the point of view of one who finds in birds only a 
mark to shoot at or a toothsome tidbit. There is 
little appreciation of the naturalist's interest, and 
often contempt for those who have a sentimental 
interest in birds or who seek, for example, to save 
our native doves from the fate of the passenger 
pigeon by protecting them from the sportsman's 
slaughter. The author is open in his condemnation 
of market hunters, but regales his readers with glow- 
ing accounts of days of good hunting when the 
shooting was fast and furious and the record of the 
slaughter a phenomenal one. He calls for national 
game preserves in the natural haunts of wild fowl, 
— especially water-fowl, which as yet have profited 
but little by our forest reserves and national parks. 
The rapid growth of great private preserves in re- 
cent year 8 is recorded, and the belief is expressed 
that in them the European custom of driving up 
game to the slaughter will become general. Brief 
color descriptions in the appendix and a number of 
plates of bird portraits will help the sportsman to 
identify the contents of his bag. A brusque style, 
with an abundance of varied anecdote, lend interest 
to the book. 

In accordance with a time-honored

Wave* and 
Ripples. 



"Waves and Ripples in Water, Air, and JEther" 
(Nelson ) is to be taken as a criterion of their capa- 
city. The author has reduced to book form his 
lectures, which were abundantly illustrated by ex- 
periments with and demonstrations of the move- 
ments of waves and ripples in various media and 
their agency in the transmission of the several forms 
of energy. Beginning with the visible and well 
known forms in water, the author passes to the in- 
visible and less known vibrations in air and aether 
which are concerned with sound, heat, light, and 
electricity. Simple explanations are given of their 
properties and functions and of their utilization in 
the arts and industries. Thus we learn how the 
wave-making resistance of a battle ship is deter- 
mined and why a racing yacht makes but a small 
wave at the bow and leaves a clean wake behind. 
British and American models are figured, but their 
waves and ripples fail to show why the Queen's cup 
remains in Yankee hands. Considerable attention 
is paid to the electrical phenomena which make 
wireless telegraphy possible, and a clear scientific 
description is given of the Marconi system. The 
phenomena of heat and light are only mentioned 
incidentally, but sound is very fully treated, with 
abundant illustrations. Enough of the book is free 
from technicalities to make it intelligible to the en- 
quiring reader, and enough of the fibre remains to 
whet his appetite for stronger meat. 

Mr. John R. Spears has written a 
Anthony w%ne. rather commonplace Life of An- 
thony Wayne for the "Historic 
Lives" series (Appleton). Full use has been made 
of the meagre details which posterity knows of 
Anthony Wayne the surveyor, and the author 
grasps the opportunity of making comparison with 
the early life of Washington. As General Wayne, 
the subject provides more material, especially in 
connection with the battle of Stony Point and the 
much later Indian battle at the Fallen Timber. 
The ingratitude of Congress in the treatment of 
Wayne is dwelt upon; and Washington's poor 
opinion of the reckless general, even when ap- 
pointing him to the command of the Western 
army, is attributed to the influence of jealous 
fellow-officers in the Revolutionary days. The au- 
thor would have difficulty in proving to the Ameri- 
can public that Silas Deane " became a traitor " to 
his country, to be mentioned in connection with 
Arnold. No patience is confessed for those who 
would palliate Arnold's conduct. A number of 
minor errors, like the inauguration of Washington 
on March 4, 1789, can scarcely be condoned by 
the good literary style of the little biography.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



It was on the last day of the year 1870 that the late 
Sir Henry Yule dated the preface to his great edition 
of Marco Polo, and added the words which dedicated 
the work to the Princess of Piedmont who afterwards 
became the Queen of Italy. Four years later, a second 
edition appeared, with much additional matter. From 
then until his death fifteen years later, Yule was every- 
where recognized as the chief authority upon the Vene- 
tian traveller and his book, and continued to accumulate 
new materials for future use. We now have, imported 
by the Messrs. Scribner, a third edition of the work, 
revised throughout by M. Henri Cordier, intimately 
associated with the original editor in scholarship, and 
accompanied by a memoir of Yule by Miss Amy Fran- 
ces Yule, his daughter. The work in its final form oc- 
cupies two very large volumes, which aggregate over a 
thousand pages, and are richly illustrated. 

The following additions have been made to the Uni- 
versity of Chicago preprints from the Decennial Publi- 
cations: "The Toledo Manuscript of the Ger mania of 
Tacitus," by Professor Frank Frost Abbott; "The 
Introduction of Comedy into the City Dionysia," by 
Professor Edward Capps ; "Equilibrium in Aqueous 
Solutions of Carbonates," by Mr. Herbert N. McCoy ; 
"The Commentariolum Petitionis Attributed to Quin- 
tus Cicero," by Professor George Lincoln Hendrickson; 
" Invariants of Differential Quantics," by Professor 
H. Maschke; and "The Unity of Plato's Thought," 
by Professor Paul Shorey. 

" The History of the Treman, Tremaine, Truman 
Family in America," by Mr. Ebenezer Mack Treman 
and Dr. Murray E. Poole, is a ponderous genealogical 
work that comes to us with the imprint of the Ithaca 
" Democrat." It is in two volumes of over a thousand 
pages each, and weighs about ten pounds. The families 
here traced include the descendants of Joseph Truman, 
of New London, Conn., and of four other men named 
Mack, Dey, Board, and Ayer. Their descendants, of 
course, include countless other names. The plan of the 
work is simple, and it is elaborately indexed. There 
are many full- page portrait illustrations. 

Every year at about this time we receive from 
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. a number of dainty little 
booklets included in their " What Is Worth YVhile "

"Mary of Bethany," by Dr. J. R. Miller; "The Face 
of the Master," by the same author; "The New Ethics," 
by President Hyde; " A Sailor Apostle," by Mr. Frank 
T. Bullen ; " Meditations," from the French of the 
Able" Rous by Miss Isabel F. Hapgood; "The Poet's 
Vision of Man," by Mr. John Walker Powell, Jr.; and 
" How to Be Self-Supporting at College," by Mr. James

volumes of this season especially attractive.

" The Temple Autobiographies," edited by Mr. Will-

Some announcement of this series will be made later. 

Ruf us King's " Ohio," and John Esten Cooke's " Vir-

done for the history of Virginia by Mr. William Garrott 
Brown. 

Mr. Richard Le Gallienne, who has privately issued 
his rendering in verse of " Odes from the Divan of 
Hafiz," freely rendered from literal translations, has 
made arrangements by which the book may be obtained 
from Messrs. Scott-Thaw Co., of New York. The

series of the illustrations reproduced from the wood- 
cuts included in Lyon's edition of 1538. The edition is 
to be limited to 750 copies. 

Arrangements have been made for the publication 
in England of the following Autumn books of Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co.: " Long Will " by Miss Flor-

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. will publish, in co-operation 
with Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co., of London, a new school 
edition of Shakespeare's plays called the "Temple 
School Shakespeare." Though entirely distinct from 
the well-known " Temple Shakespeare," it will be in its 
way equally attractive. The special features include a 
large-type text, an adequate introduction and full notes 
of a literary rather than philological character, together 
with a glossary. The illustrations are by well-known 
artists. 

•'The Journal of English and Germanic Philology" 
is the new title of the quarterly review which has 
hitherto been known as " The Journal of Germanic 
Philology." With this extension of its scope, the 
periodical, now entering upon its fifth year, considerably 
enlarges its usefulness, and the association of Professor 
Albert S. Cook with Professor Gustaf E Karsten, the 
former editor-in-chief, brings new strength to the enter- 
prise. The contents remain, as formerly, predomi- 
nantly of a linguistic character, although literature (in 
the historical sense, at least) finds its way into a number 
of the contributions. 

The death of Henry Demarest Lloyd, on the twenty- 
eighth of last month, at the age of fifty-six, is a cause 
of sincere mourning to all who are working for the 
amelioration of social conditions. One does not need 
to approve of all his methods, or accept all his conclu- 
sions, to feel that the world is poorer for his loss. He 
was a reformer of the practical type, who was sure of 
what be wanted, and set about its accomplishment by 
deed as well as word. It has often seemed to us that 
his vision was clouded by sentiment, and that his deep 
sympathy with the toiler made him a biased judge of 
the complicated issues between labor and capital; but 
we could never question his sincerity or his force. Born 
in New York, he lived there for the first twenty- five years 
of his life, aud made his mark in the movements for free 
trade and for municipal reform. After 1872 he was a 
resident of Chicago, and for many years an editorial 
writer for the " Tribune." He was a valued reviewer 
for The Dial in its earlier years. His books came late 
in life, and include "Wealth against Commonwealth," 
"Labor Copartnership," "Newest Englaud," and "A 
Country without Strikes." His power of marshalling 
facts and figures was extraordinary in its effective- 
ness, and although he was always an advocate, it was 
of causes in which he thoroughly believed. A gentle 
and lovable man, his memory is dear to all who knew 
him, and will remain a permanent inspiration for many 
lives.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



THE STORY OF A BOOK. 



IN THREE CHAPTERS. 



* Chapter 2. How the Book Is Made. 

" A LL young people should have a dictionary 
**■ at their elbow; and while you are about 
it, get the best — get Webster." So said a 
school journal many years ago, and the G. & C. 
Merriam Company took the phrase as their 
motto. "Get the Best" — this for the public. 
"Make the Best" — this for themselves. 

Successful business rests on two principles: 
make a good article, and let the world know it. 
In their work the Merriams have emphasized 
quality even more than publicity. Starting 
sixty years ago with the great fabric Noah 
Webster had reared, they spent years in refash- 
ioning it for popular needs before publishing, 
and the Webster's International Dictionary of 
to-day is the result of a long series of revisions. 
Spending freely for advertising, they have in 
the last quarter century spent a much larger 
sum for improvements, in re-editing and re- 
casting. Some leading member of the firm has 
always had the editorial work as his specialty, 
and between publishers and editors there has 
been thorough harmony and cooperation. 

The constant aim has been to make the best 
possible one-volume dictionary, for the use of 
the man on the street, the cultivated reader, the 
teacher and pupil, the scholar and expert, the 
mechanic, the foreign student, the whole read- 
ing public. The basal principle has been to 
employ the amplest stores of scholarship so 
as to best serve the average consulter. The 
qualities kept in view have been Accuracy, 
Clearness, Fullness, Convenience, Attractive- 
ness. Any single word in the vocabulary will 
illustrate these principles. First, the word 
is easily found, — a strict alphabetical order 
being followed, with ingenious resources of 
arrangement and type to facilitate the search. 
Next, note that the word's mere presence in 
the vocabulary shows that it has a certain 
standing. There has been no attempt to pile 
up numbers ; neither dead words nor gutter- 
scrapings have been favored ; something of 
merit and of permanence is implied in each 
word. Then comes the pronunciation, — are- 
spelling which is quickly caught by the ordi- 
nary eye and ear ; and a use of the phonetic 
marks which every public school child has 
learned. Substantially these same marks, be- 

* Chapter 1 of "The Story of a Book" appeared in our 
previous issue. 



ginning with Webster's Speller and extending 
into the nation's school books, have been uni- 
fying the pronunciation of the whole people for 
a century. 

Next comes the etymology — the parentage 
of the word in earlier tongues. Into this has 
gone a world of toil. When Dr. Johnson was 
questioned as to the source of his etymologies, 
he answered easily, " Why, sir, here is a shelf 
with Junius and Skinner and others ; and there 
is a Welch gentleman who will help me with 
the Welch." But Webster, though at the out- 
set well equipped according to the standard of 
the time, stopped in his work for years to ac- 
quire twenty foreign vocabularies. The next 
generation saw a great advance in linguistic 
science, and the fruits of this were harvested 
by a distinguished German scholar, Dr. Mahn, 
for the 1864 edition. The later gains in 
etymology have been inwrought in the Inter- 
national and its Supplement by the eminent 
Professor Edward S. Sheldon, of Harvard. 
As a result, each word's treatment opens with 
its clear and exact lineage, on which the 
scholar's eye pauses with fascination. 

Then come the definitions in their historical 
order. Accuracy and lucidity of definition, 
Webster's special distinction, have been the 
first aim and constant care of his successors in 
the work. The searcher for a special meaning 
finds it easily and to his satisfaction ; and, be- 
yond his original quest, his attention is apt to 
be caught by the curious way in which one 
meaning has grown out of another, by some 
bit of interesting fact, by a felicitous quotation 
or striking picture, and so his eye wanders over 
the page from one attraction to another. The 
old story of the man who found the dictionary 
interesting reading, but with a frequent change 
of subject, had a solid basis. There are few 
more entertaining volumes for a leisure hour 
than Webster's International. 

The book has been naturally broadened by 
the addition to its vocabulary of various Tables. 
One goes to the dictionary for all sorts of 
words ; why not then for proper names, which 
require not definition but information ? So here 
in one Appendix are the world's distinguished 
people of all times, some 10,000 ; name and its 
pronunciation, nationality, characteristic, birth 
and death dates. Here is the Gazetteer with 
more than 25,000 geographical titles, each line 
a miracle of condensed information. And here 
is a Dictionary of Fictitious Persons and Places 
in Literature, which one should hardly consult 
when his moments are precious, so strongly

do its pages fascinate and detain. These, and 
various other Tables — foreign proverbs, ab- 
breviations, etc. — too many to be here set 
down. Taken as a whole, Webster's Inter- 
national is, in the words of President Eliot of 
Harvard, " a wonderfully compact storehouse 
of accurate information." 

This whole mass of information — vocabu- 
lary and appendixes — is constantly brought 
up to the latest date by an unintermitted pro- 
cess of revision. The results appear partly in 
occasional Supplements, more rarely in general 
revisions, and constantly in minute corrections 
made without announcement. Thus to the vo- 
cabulary of the International of 1890 there was 
added ten years later a Supplement of 25,000 
new words and meanings. On the mere num- 
ber no stress is laid ; nothing is easier than to 
pitchfork words together by the thousand and 
ten thousand ; — technical, obsolete, disrepu- 
table, and useless. The real need, the real task, 
comes in the sifting, the choosing from the huge 
welter of written and spoken language those 
words which have an individuality and in 
some way a real use. The International had 
made a satisfactory record of the English lan- 
guage until 1890; the additition of 25,000 
words, phrases, etc., was a fair representation 
of the actual growth of the language for a de- 
cade in this swift, rushing, and prolific age. 
The contributors to this Supplement, besides 
the office staff, were such specialists as Presi- 
dent Remsen of Johns Hopkins University, 
Justice Brewer of the United States Supreme 
Court, General Greely of the United States 
Army, Professor Chittenden, director of the 
Sheffield Scientific School, Mr. Dudley Buck, 
and a score of other eminent experts. At this 
time the plates of the entire work were newly 
cast. 

Of other improvements, a good instance is 
the very recent and thorough revision of the 
Biographical Dictionary and the Gazetteer. 
These have been worked over line by line and 
word by word, with reference to spelling and 
pronunciation as well as other information. In 
geography the publications of official boards 
have been consulted ; in hundreds of cases not 
thus to be settled recourse has been had to Mr. 
Henry Gannett, chairman of the U. S. Board 
on Geographic Names ; uncounted letters have 
been written to local authorities. The biogra- 
phies have not only been amended to include 
the fresh death dates, but old dates have been 
corrected, sometimes fifteen centuries back, and 
many minor points retouched. This revision, 



the work of able scholars, was, like the Sup- 
plement of New Words, supervised by Dr. W. 
T. Harris, U. S. Commissioner of Education. 

As occasions arise, new words and meanings 
are frequently inserted in the body of the work 
by costly plate corrections. When Ohm and 
Volt were redefined by International Congress 
and U. S. statute, the new measurements went 
into the body of the vocabulary ; when the 
Roentgen ray was discovered, it was given due 
place and description; when Appendicitis be- 
gan to plague humanity under its own name, 
it was duly entered ; and so in hundreds of 
cases. 

In its mechanical features, the International, 
like its predecessors, is a serviceable, durable, 
and beautiful book. Made at the Riverside 
Press, by H. O. Houghton & Co., its binding, 
paper, typography, all are fully up to the 
standard set long ago by its manufacturers 
and publishers. 

On the commercial side of their business, 
the G. & C. Merriam Company have found no 
occasion to resort to premiums, *' combines," 
" great reductions," and the various devices 
by which wares are foisted on indifferent or 
reluctant buyers. They have steadily offered 
good value for a reasonable price, and have 
found always an ample market. They have 
made a Subscription Edition of the Interna- 
tional, with a Historical Supplement, corre- 
sponding in merit and attractiveness to the 
main work. The regular edition is sold through 
the bookstores, and it is a great satisfaction to 
the publishers that their relations with " the 
trade " — as the bookselling fraternity is for 
some occult reason entitled — have always 
been marked by confidence and cordiality. 

For some years past, the market has been 
flooded with large M Webster's Dictionaries " 
other than the International, generally at a low 
price and often with extravagant claims as to 
authenticity and value. All these books have 
the same basis, the Webster's of 1847, on 
which the copyright has expired, and which was 
completely superseded by the ** Unabridged " 
of 1864, and that in turn by the editions of 
1879, 1890, and 1900. This now ancient vol- 
ume of 1847, reprinted by cheap processes 
which have faithfully reproduced all the obso- 
lete scholarship, all the discredited etymologies, 
all the statements falsified by modern discov- 
ery, every accidental misprint, every blurred 
line and broken letter in the original ; padded 
out with supplementary matter, in one or two 
instances of some real value, in most cases crude 



276

[Oct. 16, 



and of little worth, and in no case of first-class 
scholarship ; made generally with poor paper, 
print and binding ; sold sometimes under fairly 
honest descriptions, but frequently under false 
pretenses of being the authentic, modern, and 
best Webster, — these books have no standing 
with scholars, and for the general public they 
have no recommendation in comparison with 
the International, except their cheapness. 

"The best" is never the cheapest. More 
exactly, using " cheap " as meaning " low- 
priced," the best is never the cheapest ; while 
using cheap to signify good value relative to 
price, the best is generally the cheapest. Web- 
ster's International is an expensive book, com- 
pared with dictionaries of a lower grade ; it is 
not expensive, compared with other works re- 
sembling it in the mental and material toil and 
cost involved in the construction. " The best " 
is stamped on every stage of its production ; 
on the original genius and life-long labor of 
Noah Webster ; the succession of eminent 
scholars who have perfected it ; the care which 
keeps it always abreast of modern knowledge; 
and the mechanical processes which make a 
volume unsurpassed in usability, durability, 
and beauty. 

The series of authorized Abridgments, headed 
by the admirable Webster's Collegiate Dic- 
tionary, and ended by the " Pocket," meet the 
various wants of different classes. But the 
English speaking public has been educated by 
Webster and his successors beyond any other 
people to the common use of the large one- 
volume dictionary — a work of some 2400 
pages, with 5000 illustrations ; a complete in- 
terpreter of the English language ; a treasury 
of general information. Not for the scholar and 
the expert only, but for the merchant, the 
mechanic, the housewife, the professional man, 
the average man and woman, "the best" is 
none too good. 

But what impartial and competent authority 
shall decide among various claimants to supe- 
riority which is the best ? In the next issue shall 
be cited on that question the pronouncements 
of three tribunals, widely diverse in character, 
and all of the highest standing.

A STRONG AND REALISTIC STORY 

THE SHERRODS 

By GEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON 

Author of "GRAUSTARK," "CASTLE CRANEYCROW," Etc. 
In an entirely different vein from his former work 

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS 



" The greatest promise in the book lies in the way the 
author has handled it. It isn't a bit of sprint work, 
good for a hundred yards. He keeps up the pace ; 
indeed, he grows better as he proceeds. . . . It is a far 
better book from all points of the literary compass than 
his 'Graustark' and he fairly wins his spurs in it. . . ." 

— Cleveland Leader. 

" It is a strong story in its chief points and in delinea- 
ment of character." — Syracuse Herald. 

"His unflagging vigor and veracity compel respect." 

— Boston Advertiser. 

" The story reads as if taken from real life — as it might 
easily have been." — -Milwaukee Times. 



" Mr. McCutcheon's book has all the elements of success, 
being a plain unadorned story of real life, carrying the 
conviction of its reality on every page." 

— Philadelphia Item. 
" The story is bright, clever, and entertaining, and the 
popularity of Mr. McCutcheon as a story-teller will not 
be lessened by this, his latest effort." 

— Indianapolis Sentinel. 
" Mr. McCutcheon's latest book, ' The Sherrods,' is, we 
think, the best of the three that he has written. . . ." 
— New York American. 
" ' The Sherrods ' is far above the usual run of novels, 
and deserves to be ranked among the very good things 
of the year's fiction." — Nashville American. 



A first rate American Story, full of Action and Interest. 

"Like others of the successful books which have had enormous sales, it has that 
indefinable something about it which few stories possess, and which forces a 
book into universal popularity."

House, Scotland. Barbara found life at Fogo

having to run away in men's clothes to accomplish 
her purpose. On her way she lost the kit containing 
her proper attire, and, being without means, put 
up at Our Lady's Inn, the lodging house of impe- 
cunious young men. She passed through many 
adventures, unusual and entertaining, in the course

WILLIAM EDWARD HARTPOLE 
L ECKY . 

Among the historians of the older genera- 
tion, who knew how to temper the scientific 
method with the philosophical spirit, and who 
did not disdain the adventitious aid of literary 
grace in the composition of their works, the 
great Irishman who has just passed away will 
always be given a high place. Born in 1838, 
William Edward Hartpole Lecky achieved dis- 
tinction at an early age. Only two years after 
he had taken his first degree at Trinity Col- 
lege, Dublin, he published the group of essays 
on Swift, Flood, Grattan, and O'Connell, which 
first gave the public the measure of his abili- 
ties. This volume, entitled "The Leaders of 
Public Opinion in Ireland," embodied esti- 
mates, at once searching and sympathetic, of 
the men who stood for Irish nationalism a hun- 
dred years ago, when the question of the Union 
occupied the foreground of political discussion. 
The successive revisions of this book, the last 
of which appeared only a few months ago, offer 
an interesting study of the growing conserva- 
tism of the writer, for, although he sympa- 
thized with the opposition to the Act of 1800, 
he accepted it as a fait accompli, and his face 
was set, in his later years, against the home 
rule agitation which sought in some measure 
to undo the work of Pitt and weaken the bonds 
of the United Kingdom. For this course he 
earned his share of violent abuse from the ex- 
cited Irish nationalists of the time, and the 
quiet approval of all philosophical and far- 
seeing students of human affairs. 

The first appearance of the work above- 
mentioned was followed, two years later, by 
the " History of the Rise and Influence of the 
Spirit of Rationalism in Europe," while four 
years after that a second large work was pro- 
duced having for its title " A History of Eu- 
ropean Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne." 
These works appealed to a far wider public 
than had been drawn to the essays on Irish 
leaders, and established the author's reputation 
as one of the clearest and soundest of modern 
historians. Mr. Lecky was barely thirty years 
of age when both these productions stood to 
his credit, and they have held their place as

(Nov. 1, 



standard works upon their subjects for so long 
a period that it is not easy for men of our 
younger generation to realize that the years 
of their author were but sixty-five when their 
tale was completed a few days ago. He 
seems to have belonged to as old a generation 
as that of Mr. Goldwin Smith, for example, 
but Mr. Smith is now eighty years old, and had 
achieved marked distinction when Mr. Lecky 
was but a youngster. 

The introduction to the " History of Ration- 
alism " makes the following statement of the 
author's aim : 

" My object in the present work has been to trace the 
history of the spirit of Rationalism ; by which I under- 
stand, not any class of definite doctrines or criticisms, 
but rather a certain cast of thought, or bias of reasoning, 
which has during the last three centuries gained a 
marked ascendancy in Europe. The nature of this bias 
will be exhibited in detail in the ensuing pages, when 
we examine its influence upon the various forms of moral 
and intellectual development. At present, it will be 
sufficient to say, that it leads men on all occasions to 
subordinate dogmatic theology to the dictates of reason 
and of conscience, and, as a necessary consequence, 
greatly to restrict its influence upon life. It predisposes 
men, in history, to attribute all kinds of phenomena to 
natural rather than miraculous causes; in theology, to 
esteem succeeding systems the expressions of the wants 
and aspirations of that religious sentiment which is 
planted in all men; and, in ethics, to regard as duties 
only those which conscience reveals to be such." 

The determination thus evinced to recognize 
the paramount importance of the dictates of 
reason in dealing with the vexed problems of 
conduct and religious thought characterizes 
the entire development both of this work and 
of the " History of Morals " which soon fol- 
lowed it. Such a programme does not appear 
very startling to us, but to the public of a 
generation ago it made Mr. Lecky seem a very 
dangerous radical. The softening of old preju- 
dices and the dissipating of old dogmatisms 
which have marked the last thirty or forty 
years have brought silent but convincing testi- 
mony to the clearness of his vision and the 
essential soundness of his principles. 

The next great work of Mr. Lecky was his 
" History of England in the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury." This work embraces four volumes, and 
their publication falls between 1878 and 1882. 
The treatment is not chronological, nor does 
it involve the attention to details found in his- 
tory of the conventional sort. It is rather, in 
the author's own words, an attempt " to dis- 
engage from the great mass of facts those which 
relate to the permanent forces of the nation, 
or which indicate some of the more enduring 
features of national life." We have, then, in 



this work, a philosophical discussion in the best 
sense, a treatment of English history which 
deals in the main with political ideas, with 
social institutions, and with the development 
of the various forces that make for culture and 
enlightenment. The work is one which every 
student of modern English history finds indis- 
pensable for his purposes. To American stu- 
dents, in particular, it is valuable for its 
judicial and dispassionate treatment of the 
revolt from English rule which made an inde- 
pendent nation of the United States. 

Mr. Lecky's two remaining works of im- 
portance are his " Democracy and Liberty," 
dated 1896, and " The Map of Life," dated 
1899. In the first of these works he discusses 
the faults of democracy as they appear in the 
eyes of a life-long liberal, or, in other words, 
of a critic predisposed to sympathize with the 
principles of popular government, but also de- 
termined to hold it up to an exalted standard 
of conduct. The truest friends of democracy 
are those who, like Mr. Lecky, unsparingly 
censure its shortcomings, and insist that it can 
justify its existence in no other way than by 
making clearly manifest its superiority over 
the older polities which it seeks to supplant. 
In " The Map of Life " the ripeness of a 
scholar's wisdom is brought to bear upon the 
problems that chiefly press upon the modern 
world for solution. The book is concerned 
with the two great themes of " conduct and 
character," and the author, always prominently 
a moralist, here becomes predominantly one. 
Even more than Mr. Lecky's earlier books, 
this collection of essays places their author 
distinctly among the small number of great 
thinkers who have reduced prejudice and per- 
sonal predilection to a minimum, who have 
discarded hobbies and are incapable of wild 
vagaries, and who are essentially right in their 
view of the questions with which they deal. He 
is of the company of such men as Mill and 
Huxley and John Fiske and John Morley and 
Goldwin Smith — men whose devotion to truth 
is absolute, and who are incapable of making 
any sort of compromise with error. 

Our account of Mr. Lecky's writings would 
be noticeably incomplete without a few words 
about the small volume of " Poems " which he 
published about ten years ago. It was an un- 
pretentious little volume, and got small atten- 
tion from the public. Those who took the 
trouble to mention it in a critical way seem to 
have taken for granted that a writer of Mr. 
Lecky's severe philosophical cast could not

compose verses that were worth reading, and to 
have expressed their opinion without attempt- 
ing to verify it. To us the volume came as a 
delightful surprise, for it displayed qualities of 
grace and tenderness, of deep emotion and no- 
bility of temper that could hardly have been in- 
ferred from the author's prose. The verses are 
reflective, and tinged with melancholy, inspired 
by the Wordsworthian tradition, and belonging 
in the same category with those of Arnold and 
Clough. If we may not linger over these deli- 
cate and wistful songs, we may at least find in 
one of them — " The Dying Seer " — a sort of 
epitaph for their author, now departed from 
the community of the living. 

« Close the book — the words are written, 
They will stand for good or ill; 
True, the stately palm is smitten, 

Bnt its seeds are living still; 
Darkness gathers round the writer, 
Envious murmurs greet his name, 
But his thoughts will shine the brighter 
In the after-glow of fame." 



THE REIGN OF THE SPECTACULAR. 

In the varied phases of modern thought and ac- 
tivity, the obvious holds unchallenged sway. The 
deeds that are conspicuous, the ideas that are garish, 
the literature that is episodic and pictorial, gain the 
popular favor. The eye of the senses is regnant, — 
often a substitute for ear, imagination, and reason. 
Surface-impressions satisfy ; " the eyes of our un- 
derstanding" are dimly enlightened. In the ver- 
nacular of the American youth, every entertainment 
is a "show," whether at the theatre or the church, 
at home or at school. With all possible tribute to 
the progress and appreciation of art during the last 
quarter-century, one must admit that there is a craze 
for pictures and pageants apart from their essential 
or even relative value. There is a commercial de- 
mand for all grades of illustration, from classics to 
crudities. No calling, no field of activity, is exempt. 
The clergyman who uses an angling-line and bait as 
illustration in his sermon, the " reportorial artist " 
who haunts the President and " catches five facial 
expressions " during an earnest address, the prolix 
hack-writer who produces an emblazoned book of 
travel in countries that he has never seen, the hostess 
who entertains by a flaring vaudeville, — all these are 
alike offenders against dignity and taste. Speakers 
of renown may find listeners to a discourse upon 
some scientific or literary theme, but even such are 
occasionally startled by the inquiry, "Haven't you 
some lectures with lantern slides ? " Privileged to 
listen to Mrs. MeynelFs sympathetic interpreta- 
tion of Herrick, Vaughan, and their Cavalier com- 
panions, I heard, in exit, the following sentences : 
"Was n't she charming?" " Oh, yes, I was glad to 



hear her, but I don't care much now for lectures 
unless they are illustrated." What, indeed, had this 
poet-essayist accomplished, if she had not illustrated 
her chosen authors ? The true meaning of the word, 
— to elucidate, or make luminous, — seems almost 
lost in its exclusive reference to " sense material." 

Comment is needless upon the supremacy of the 
pictorial journal, and upon the scanty discrimination, 
among the mass of readers, as to literary or artistic 
merits. Only experience could make credible the 
fact that in homes, refined in other ways, the "pic- 
ture section " of the Sunday newspaper is given to> 
the children as amusement, — lofty pabulum for the 
traditional if not lineal descendants of the Puritans I 
Lowell's words are relevant : " Good taste may not 
be necessary to salvation or to success in life, but it 
is one of the most powerful factors of civilization." 

The alliance of picture and text dates back even 
to the crude wood-cuts of Caxton's " Game and Play 
of the Chesse " in 1476, and the early broadsides 
down to Bewick and his successors. Pictorial and lit- 
erary art have been reciprocally stimulating. Hiram 
Powers's " Greek Slave " evoked one of Mrs. Brown- 
ing's most tender sonnets. Giotto's portrait of 
Dante inspired Lowell to rare verse. The Cenci 
gave incentive to Shelley's drama and Hawthorne's 
romance. Many an artist of a later generation 
has infused fresh vitality into a hackneyed literary 
model. Millai8 visualized Effie Deans. Mr. Abbey's 
character-interpretations have revealed anew the 
creative genius of both poet and painter. Miss 
Austen and Mrs. Gaskell have been rejuvenated by 
Mr. Hugh Thomson's delineations. "Lewis Car- 
roll " could not have foreseen the revival of popu- 
larity which would greet his wonderland-child when 
Mr. Peter Newell should portray the droll fancies 
of his creation. 

Because of the usefulness of such commingled 
art of a high grade, one must the more deplore the 
bizarre in text and illustration. Perhaps with pre- 
vision of this danger, Wordsworth wrote his sonnet 
on "Blustrated Books and Magazines," with its 
warning, — 

" Avaunt this vile abuse of pictured page ! 
Must eyes be all in all, the tongue and ear 
Nothing ? Heaven keep us from a lower stage ! " 

As a natural means of educating the starved im- 
aginations of children, victims of the lifeless, sta- 
tistical text-books of the past, as a road to forming 
word-concepts and moral ideas, picture-studies have 
been of inestimable value. A few far-seeing stu- 
dents of pedagogy, however, have sounded the alarm 
against excess of picture-teaching, lest it defeat its 
end and leave inert both mind and fancy. To cul- 
tivate individual ideas, to educe subjective interpre- 
tations of life and letters, is the desideratum of all 
education ; such results are often hindered by excess 
of scenic material. 

The fashion of dramatized novels, to keep pace 
with the melodramatic trend of modern life, is only 
an extravagant revival of earlier literary custom. 
Shakespeare dramatized chronicles, traditions, and 



298

the meagre fiction then available. Scott and Dickens 
were often staged during the years of their first j 
success. A bibliography of Dickens mentions over I 
fifty plays adapted from his works, five versions 
of "David Copperfield" appearing the year of its 
publication. " Monte Christo," "Jane Eyre," " Rip 
Van Winkle," and "Uncle Tom's Cabin " are only 
a few of many familiar examples of long-popular 
dramatizations. The danger to-day, however, lurks 
in the motives of the authors. Dickens and Scott 
and Irving did not write to satisfy an immediate 
audience. Literary impulse actuated their fiction ; 
pictorial and dramatic effects were interwoven as 
natural expressions of theme or characters. Within 
the essence of the life portrayed is the dynamic 
force, the truly dramatic force, in all literature of 
highest rank. One can readily recall novels of the 
past and present, of strong dramatic power, where 
both action and dialogue were scantily used in di- 
rect evidence, but where analysis and interpretation 
have projected the characters and theme upon the 
reader's mind with great dramatic force. Of such 
types are " Daniel Deronda" and " Henry Esmond," 
"The Scarlet Letter" and "Rhoda Fleming," 
"The Valley of Decision" and "The Mettle of the 
Pasture." 

In the effort to adapt fiction of the most delicate 
literary quality to the stage, there is generally a loss 
of subtle charm, both in characterization and emo- 
tional development. To hasten in unveiling the 
gradual mental processes, in response to the demands 
of the stage, is to detract from subtlety and strength. 
After witnessing a few of the popular dramatiza- 
tions of romance, one can appreciate the dread of 
Charlotte Bronte when she heard that " Jane Eyre " 
was to be staged, and her unwillingness to witness 
it; and can sympathize with the sarcasm of a present- 
day novelist to her playwright, " I congratulate you 
upon the success with which you have dramatized 
the title of my novel." 

To justify the excess of melodrama and the drama- 
tized romance, the half-truth has been reiterated, 
" After all, we go to the theatre to see a spectacle." 
In gratifying this surface pleasure, which is really 
only a means to an end, we have forgotten the primal 
use of the stage for religious and moral culture. 
There may seem a radicalism in the proposed ex- 
periment, in one or two specific cases, to unite the 
theatre and the church ; yet such would be only a 
return to historical models. The revival of the best 
Moralities, heralded by " Everyman," will achieve 
more than passing amusement or merely intellectual 
culture. The dramaturgic devices in such plays will 
not submerge the motive and symbolism, and the 
drama will thus become a potent religious agency, 
as it was in the days before the reign of Puritanism. 
The inventions and mechanical devices used in pro- 
ducing " Ben-Hur " occasioned wonder in the world 
of art and science ; the religious element and the 
personalities, however, were subservient to the glit- 
tering pageant, in marked contrast to the simple and 
soul-stirring miracle-plays at Oberammergau, Brix- 



legg, and other peasant villages in Southern Europe. 
In the complex mental and social phases of modern 
life, there are classified interests ; and the indivi- 
dual's choice defines his tastes and moral standards. 
To meet the excessive demand for the spectacular, 
however, the higher grades of fiction and drama 
have been pushed aside, and many a promising 
imagination has been perverted by undue attention 
to vapid or erotic plays. With anxiety, a manager 
of loftier aim ventures to offer an occasional work 
of literary excellence like Mr. Stephen Phillips's 
" Ulysses." This effort to cultivate a better taste is 
decreed a signal failure by the public, unless the 
opening night brings a crowded house, frequent 
curtain-calls, and fulsome praise from critics who 
deem it their mission chiefly to carp. In contem- 
porary revival of Shakespeare there is insistent 
hope, for Shakespeare no longer means " financial 
ruin to the theatrical agent." To satisfy the popular 
craze for spectacular background, there is often de- 
traction from dramatic simplicity and potency. To 
reproduce Shakespeare without any illusive charm 
would be a futile experiment for general adoption. 
One may cite Edwin Booth's story of his most satis- 
factory portrayal of " Hamlet " in a small Western 
town when the scenery and costumes failed to arrive ; 
but this signal victory over adventitious circumstances 
did not convert him to such custom. Our quarrel is 
with the abuse, not the decorous use, of scenic art. 
When Mrs. Fiske appears in " A Doll's House " 
with a single crude interior scene and one change 
of simple dress, she so holds her auditors by her 
grasp and revelation of the tragic discord between 
Nora and Thorwald that they forget to make those 
rude preparations for departure which stigmatize our 
" nation in a hurry." 

As an influence to counteract melodrama and 
sensationalism, one might suggest a revival of the 
best comedies of the past and adaptation of fiction 
with gently satiric vein. Shakespeare's comedies 
are ever popular. Why not more frequent presen- 
tation of Moliere and Goldsmith and Sheridan? 
Under the witty cleavage of wholesome satire, many 
of the excesses of current art and fashion would 
disappear. Mr. George Meredith has well empha- 
sized the effect of comedy upon sensationalism: 
"Thus, for want of instruction in the comic idea, 
we lose a large audience among our cultivated mid- 
dle class that we should expect to support comedy. 
One excellent test of the civilization of a country I 
take to be the flourishing of the comic idea and 
comedy ; and the test of true comedy is that it shall 
awaken laughter. . . . You see Folly perpetually 
sliding into new shapes in a society possessed of 
wealth and leisure, with many whims, many strange 
ailments, and strange doctors. Plenty of common- 
sense in the world to thrust her back when she pre- 
tends to empire. But the first form of common- 
sense, the vigilant comic, which is the genius of 
thoughtful laughter, which would readily extinguish 
her at the outset, is not serving as a public advo- 
cate."

Novels of society offer excellent material for 
dramatization; but those should be chosen which 
will educate as well as amuse. Mr. Howells's farces 
are always successful. Why would not many of 
his novels, if dramatized with skill, offer enjoyable 
comedy ? " The Landlord at Lion's Head " and "The 
Kentons," without further enumeration, contain pic- 
torial elements cleverly interwoven with subtle wit ; 
while underlying all elements is the true love for 
honest humanity. American fiction has reproduced, 
with scenic brilliance, pictures of varied sections 
which might well allure the dramatist. The social 
contrasts in large cities have as yet been merely out- 
lined. Why should not the tragedies and comedies 
of " the other half " afford scope for drama as thrill- 
ing and corrective as its oral and written recital by 
Mr. Riis? 

The student of history is not depressed by the 
flaunting symptoms of current life and literature. 
Under different aspects, in varied ages, there have 
been like excesses of fashion. After the reign of 
euphuism and the later age of poetic artifice, there 
came reactions, renewed devotion to simple funda- 
mental truths. Satiated with the spectacular, there 
are indications to-day of a tendency toward a saner 
life. In many communities, nobler standards al- 
ready rebuke mere affluence and gaud. There is a 
general recognition of Nature's restorative for the 
strain of city life, — a life melodramatic in its seeth- 
ing streets by daylight not less than in its illusive 
forms around the foot-lights. Surviving the artifi- 
cial and the sensational rises the Excelsior of the true 
artist, — the creation and illumination of the vital. 
Elements of such endeavor are cemented in Mr. 
Garland's ideal for individual and universal service : 
" Life is the model, truth is the master, the heart of 
the man himself is the motive-power."

PROFESSOR Saintsbury has done a marked service 
to all students and practitioners of literary criticism, as 
well as to all who are occupied, whether as students or 
as teachers, with the higher reaches of the art of rhe- 
toric, by the preparation of his recent volume of " Loci 
Critici " (Ginn). The work is a chronologically-arranged 
catena of excerpts and complete documents illustrating 
the history of literary criticism from Aristotle to Arnold. 
The editorial matter is slight, consisting of notes, the 
work done in translation and condensation, and the 
selection of significant passages. In the matter of selec- 
tion, there is room for much difference of opinion, and 
we should have been glad to find within the covers of 
the volume a larger representation of the modern critics 
in other languages than our own. But the work had to 
be kept within bounds, and its usefulness is so great 
that we are not disposed to cavil over the omissions. 
Aristotle, Ben Jonson, Dryden, Wordsworth, and Cole- 
ridge, are the writers most extensively represented, 
nearly one-half of the work being devoted to these five 
men. For most purposes, this volume will do as a sub- 
stitute for a fair-sized library of original authorities, 
an economy which we should be ungrateful not to appre- 
ciate.

recollections of a notable 
Literary Life.* 



It is not given to every man to live such a 
life as that which closed when Richard Henry 
Stoddard passed away in May of the present 
year. To say nothing of having the poetic gift, 
few indeed have the stamina, the energy, the 
divine enthusiasm which carry them over the 
stony places and enable them to win an honor- 
able and permanent place in the guild of poets. 
To few has been granted the privilege of know- 
ing, and knowing intimately, so many of the 
men who made our literature during three score 
of years. He knew Bryant, Halleck, Willis, 
Poe, and nearly all of the famous New England 
group ; he was the intimate friend of Bayard 
Taylor, George Boker, and Buchanan Read ; 
he was the friend and counsellor of a host of 
younger writers, such as Stedman and Howells. 
When he went to New York to live in 1835, 
the city had not spread far above Canal Street, 
and swine roamed about on Broadway. The 
growth of New York in his life-time, however, 
is no more wonderful than the development of 
that literature of which New York became one 
of the important centres. 

Mr. Stoddard began the preparation of the 
present volume some seven years ago. In the 
spring of this year the book was finished and 
sent to press. But before its aged author had 
seen it in type he had passed away. The work 
of editing has been ably performed by Mr. 
Ripley Hitchcock, who has added some import- 
ant notes, a chapter on " The Last Years," a 
brief bibliography, and a good index. The vol- 
ume is enriched with a half-dozen illustrations, 
among which are copies of some admirable pho- 
tographs of Mr. and Mrs. Stoddard taken for 
the Authors Club in 1902. The large-paper 
edition contains in addition a number of fac- 
similes of letters and manuscripts from the 
poet's valuable library. 

The story of Mr. Stoddard's boyhood, while 
not without its parallels, is most pathetic. Suc- 
cessively clerk at an oyster bar, errand boy, 
legal copyist at less than a dollar a week, news- 
paper office-boy, tailor, book-keeper in a brush 
and bellows factory, blacksmith's apprentice, 
iron moulder, and carriage painter, he still

found a little money to buy books and a little 
time to read them. Haunting old book-stalls 
after working hours, he picked up many odd 
volumes of the English poets, among them 
Beattie and Falconer, Burns, Thomson, Cowper, 
and Shakespeare — the last volume containing 
two of his Roman plays and " Troilus and Cres- 
sida," which the boy found hard reading. He 
constantly practised the writing of verse ; and 
made the acquaintance of Park Benjamin and 
of Lewis Gay lord Clark, editor of " The Knick- 
erbocker Magazine." Of his early literary 
work he has this to say : 

" From continuous and patient practice I had now 
acquired considerable skill in the construction of melo- 
dious lines and the use of unforced rhymes, and if I 
had not attained excellence of execution, I had attained 
definiteness of conception. I knew what I wanted to 
write, and, within my limitations, how to write it. It 
was something outside of myself, something healthier 
and larger, something that concerned the emotions of 
mankind, and not my own petty feelings. If it was a 
river, and I wrote about a river, I described the stretch 
of country through which it flowed, and its human 
environments; if it was a wood, and I wrote about a 
wood, I described its shadowy leafage, the notes of its 
birds, and recalled the phantoms of its aboriginal in- 
habitants; if it was a cathedral, and I wrote about a 
cathedral, I described its massive architecture and its 
historic associations, peopling the long-drawn aisles 
with mediaeval worshippers, the festivity of their wed- 
dings, the solemnity of their funerals, and whatever 
else imagination suggested as proper to the place and 
time." 

While this formula did not produce verse of 
the highest order, it shows that the young 
poet had progressed in his conception of the 
art. He had now a sure foothold in the liter- 
ary world and published much verse in " The 
Knickerbocker," " The Union Magazine," and 
" The Home Journal." 

Of Bayard Taylor, whom he met in 1848, 
Mr. Stoddard has much to say. For years 
they were as Damon and Pythias. 

" Bayard Taylor and I met at night generally, for 
neither could call the day his own; he had his work 
to do on « The Tribune,' and I had mine to do in the 
foundry. Apart from politics, his was the cleaner of 
the two, but not the least laborious, I am sure. He 
wrote fifteen hours a day, he told me, scribbling book 
notices, leaders, foreign news, reports, — turning his 
hand and pen to everything that went to the making of 
a newspaper in 1849. flUB j|J ^., ; '^P*| 

" There was but one night in the week when he 
could do what he pleased, and that was Saturday 
night, which we always spent together when he was in 
town. I looked forward to it as a school-boy looks 
forward to a holiday, and was happy when it came. I 
have forgotten where his rooms were, but as nearly as 
I can recollect they were in a boarding-house on Murray 
Street, not far from Broadway. They were sky par- 
lours [five stories up; the building still stands. — N.], 
as the saying is, for he liked a good outlook; and be- 



sides, they suited his purse, which was not plethoric 
with shekels. In the first of these rooms, which was 
set apart for bis books, there was a little table at which 
he wrote late into the night, resting his soul with 
poetry after the prosaic labours of the day." 

In chapter vii. Mr. Stoddard gives an in- 
teresting account of a visit to Lowell, with 
some of the latter's table-talk. Here is what 
Lowell had to say on the subject of poetry : \ | 

" ' Poetry, as I understand it, is the recognition of 
something new and true in thought or feeling, the re- 
collection of some profound experience, the conception 
of some heroic action, the creation of something beau- 
tiful and pathetic. There are things in verse which 
may be questioned, but they are not the poetical things, 
are not the things which are Poetry. There can be no 
doubt about that, for it authenticates itself, and so 
absolutely that it seems not to have been written, but 
always to have been. We are not conscious of Shake- 
speare in his great plays, but of Nature, whose pen 
and instrument he was. The poetry of Shakespeare 
and his fellow-dramatists,' he continued, 'in other 
words, the poetry of the age of Elizabeth, was greater 
than any that has been written since, because the 
Englishman of the age of Elizabeth was greater than 
any Englishman that has lived since. He was more 
hardy and adventurous than his descendants, more 
resolute and reckless, more given to action and less to 
speculation, of strong natural parts, and no learning to 
speak of, clear-sighted, hearty in his manners, and 
plain, blunt, and idiomatic in his speech. If he had 
been other than he was, he could not have been the 
bulwark of Protestantism, could not have destroyed 
the Spanish Armada, and could not have had the 
Shakespearian drama.' " 

The chapter on "My Life in the Custom 
House " is full of interesting reminiscences 
of a by-gone day. One of the experiences re- 
counted was of a ball in Tammany Hall. 

"A Tammany ball was something to be remem- 
bered, though the memory of one of them should suffice. 
There was dancing, of course; there was also speech- 
making, principally by Captain Rynders and his gang. 
Toasts, generally patriotic, were proposed, and there 
never was lack of the wherewithal to wet them with; 
there were songs, too, and our national hymn was roared 
energetically, though there were reasons why some of 
the singers called it the ■ Bar Tangled Spanner.' Some 
of the guests were supposed to be absent-minded, for 
in the ladies' dressing-room the combs and brushes were 
chained to the wall." 

Mr. Stoddard has elsewhere recounted the 
episode of Poe's reception of his " Ode on a 
Grecian Flute," which he repeats here. Though 
Mr. Stoddard bore no malice toward Poe be- 
cause of this incident, and in fact shows great 
generosity in speaking of Poe's writings, yet it 
cannot be said that he sets Poe out in a favor- 
able light. He discovered for himself a fact 
not unknown to others, friends and foes alike, 
— that Poe often sold his literary wares three 
or four times over ; and that he was always a

plagiarist, though he was somehow, at the same 
time, always original. 

Mr. Stoddard had a high opinion of Boker, 
the dramatist, who, like Mrs. Stoddard, never 
became as well known as he deserved to be. 
Boker wrote thus to Mr. Stoddard of his "Fran- 
cesca da Rimini": 

"Of course, you know the story, — every one does; 
but you, nor any one else, do not know it as I have treated 
it. I have great faith in the successful issue of this new 
attempt. I think all day and write all night. This is 
one of my peculiarities, by the bye: a subject seizes me 
soul and body, which accounts for the rapidity of my exe- 
cution. My muse resembles a whirlwind: she catches 
me up, hurries me along, and drops me all breathless at 
the end of her career." 

More than once Mr. Stoddard insists, with 
justice, that a poet should not be judged by an 
absolute present-day standard, but should be 
read in connection with his time. He applies 
this to Longfellow, the spirit of whose verse 
belongs to an earlier period. Read " by the 
glimmering twilight of American literature," 
Longfellow deserves the high reputation which 
he at one time possessed. Halleck's poetry, 
too, considered in relation to its time, must be 
called remarkable. 

Not the least interesting and touching pas- 
sages in the book are those relating to the poet's 
home-life. His admiration for his wife was 
immense ; yet Longfellow told him that he 
rated her literary abilities none too highly. Her 
fiction, — "The Morgesons," " Two Men," and 
" Temple House " — he believed to be " the 
most original and powerful novels ever written 
by an American woman." Of their homes, — 
at No. 46 Third Street, at the corner of Fourth 
Avenue and Tenth Street, at the old No. 181 
Thirteenth Street, and in Fifteenth Street, east 
of Stuy vesant Square, — he speaks with ten- 
derness ; and of the death of Willy Stoddard, 
even after the lapse of forty years, he is unable 
to write without betraying great emotion. That 
he was intensely proud of his son Lorimer, the 
brilliant young dramatist, is evident. 

" He was thought to be a clever lad, was Lorimer 
Stoddard, though he had the good sense not to think 
so himself. He was tall for his age, slight of build, 
addicted to reading everything except poetry, for which 
he cared nothing, greatly to the joy of his father, who 
thought that there were altogether too many poets." 

The all too brief Introduction, written by 
his friend of over forty years, Mr. Stedman, 
dwells on the brave and manly struggle of the 
young artisan to become a poet ; on his devo- 
tion to the intellectual life ; on the modesty of 
Stoddard and his group in not heralding their 
own praises ; and on his unselfish counsel to 



his younger brethren of the craft, to whom he 
thus passed on the favors he himself had re- 
ceived as a young man. It is a worthy tribute 
to a heroic soul, a warrior who fought a good 
fight, who at the same time " knew himself 
to sing and build the lofty rhyme," and whose 
best work is his enduring monument.

Social Origins and Primal Law.* 

Lewis H. Morgan may almost be called the 
founder of American ethnology. He was a 
bold, original, and independent thinker. His 
theories produced a sensation, and set scores of 
investigators to work. His fate has been most 
curious. While everyone assigns him notable 
rank as a scholar, and must read his writings, 
few if any of his theories are actually held, as 
he presented them, by present-day scholars. 
His work on "Systems of Consanguinity and 
Terms of Relationship " was a marvel of 
laborious and painstaking industry ; its ap- 
pearance marks an epoch ; but its conclusions 
are probably repudiated by every modern 
student. 

Morgan, McLennan, Lubbock, Howitt, 
Fison, Westermarck, — these names flash to 
the mind when Social Origins are mentioned, 
or when such words are spoken as gens, clan, 
phratry, exogamy, totemism, and communal 
marriage. And, probably, most students of 
ethnology and sociology find their heads whirl- 
ing at the memory of their efforts to bring 
some order out of the disorder and confusion 
and inconsistency of the writings on the prim- 
itive family and marriage. 

What is totemism ? How did it arise ? What 
is a gens or a clan ? What is a phratry ? How 
did they arise? What is exogamy? Why do 
" lower peoples " disapprove of marriage be- 
tween persons who, from our point of view, are 
not debarred on account of relationship? Mr. 
Andrew Lang, in " Social Origins," takes up 
these and similar questions, and in so doing 
gives a review of the theories which have been 
advanced by the long list of writers from Mor- 
gan and McLennan to Crawley. The book has 
special value for two reasons : first, because it 
gives some new ideas, and, second, because it 
aims to bring about a more definite and con- 
sistent use of terms. While different authors 
are not agreed upon the meaning of words like

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



totemism and exogamy, we must expect con- 
fusion and uncertainty in discussions regard- 
ing them. 

Mr. Lang was impelled to write the book by 
the fact that the late James Jasper Atkinson, 
whose mother was Mr. Lang's aunt, left at his 
death an unpublished manuscript upon " Pri- 
mal Law." Mr. Atkinson was born in India, of 
Scottish parents. While he was still a young 
man, he settled in New Caledonia, where he 
spent the greater part of his life. In that 
archipelago he became greatly interested in 
native life and customs. He at first worked 
alone, but later became acquainted with the 
works of other students in ethnology, being 
particularly attracted to writings regarding 
primitive social organization. In preparing 
Mr. Atkinson's manuscript for the press, Mr. 
Lang was led to re-study what has been writ- 
ten upon such lines. The result is his part of 
the book before us. We shall not consider it 
at length, but shall merely indicate some of the 
special points which he makes. Several of these 
are the direct result of Atkinson's argument. 
Mr. Lang claims that exogamic tendencies 
probably existed before totemic names ; after 
the totemic name is fixed, the exogamic ten- 
dency became accentuated ; the class system of 
nomenclature has reference to generations, to 
relative age, rather than to actual kinship ; the 
phratries are later than the exogamous totem- 
gentes and are produced by their amalgama- 
tion, rather than earlier and producing them 
by cleavage ; totem names are not born in the 
gens, but are imposed from outside, often be- 
ing nick-names, even terms of reproach or con- 
tempt. This last point is perhaps distinctively 
Mr. Lang's. To its support the author brings 
some curious nicknames applied to English 
villagers, and some Sioux Indian totem-names. 
We confess that at first thought it seems highly 
unlikely that a totem-gens should accept, and 
use for itself, a term applied — perhaps con- 
temptuously — by outsiders. Nor does it really 
seem to have been done among the English vil- 
lages mentioned. It may be that Hillborough 
men call the men of Loughton "cuckoos"; is 
it true that the Loughton men have accepted 
the name and use it among themselves ? As to 
his Sioux evidence, Mr. Lang's argument com- 
pels the belief that it needs to be reexamined in 
the field. Are " hide-scrapers " and " dung- 
eaters " really totem names used and recognized 
by the totem-members themselves ; or, are they 
not truly contemptuous nicknames applied by 
the outsider who gave Mr. Dorsey his original 



list? Of course, Mr. Lang is justified in using 
the material as he does until its force is weak- 
ened. While it is accepted, his suggestion is 
novel and interesting. 

Returning now to Mr. Atkinson's paper, we 
find it important and original. He begins with 
the query why brothers and sisters may not 
marry, why they must avoid each other. The 
origin of this avoidance he seeks, not among 
savages or primitive men, but in the life of 
non-human animals. He aims to reconstruct 
the life of man's anthropoid ancestor. In the 
sex jealousy of the father in the little wandering 
group, he finds the basis of exogamy, of non- 
marriage between the brother and sister. He 
then traces the social progress of this anthro- 
poid form, step by step, in a way that is for the 
most part natural and reasonable. His first 
steps appeal strongly to us. The original and 
absolute control of the father ; the driving out 
of the young males ; the way in which first one 
(the youngest) and then all the young males 
were tolerated ; the social effect of this toler- 
ance ; the resulting exogamy, introducing for- 
eign females into the group ; the prohibitions 
and avoidances (a) of sister and brother, (6) 
of patriarch and captured females — fathers- 
in-law and daughters-in-law, — and (c) between 
mother and son, are clearly and rather satisfac- 
torily shown. What is not equally well brought 
out is the rise of the gens, with clear female 
descent and headship, which really precedes 
the form of gens with clear male headship and 
descent. Some of the difficulties and weak- 
nesses of the latter part of the discussion might 
perhaps have been overcome if Mr. Atkinson 
had lived. His " Primal Law," as it stands, is 
an ingenious and novel argument, which will 
assist us — as it has assisted Mr. Lang — in 
answering some difficult fundamental questions 
more simply and naturally than they had before 
been answered. Frederick Starr. 



Reminiscences op a Confederate 
General.* 



A very agreeable and entertaining collection 
of sketches illustrative of the American Civil 
War and its varying episodes may be found in 
the volume written by General John B. Gordon, 
formerly of the Confederate Army, and entitled 
*' Reminiscences of the Civil War." These 
recollections cover the entire period of the war ;

and they take the several forms of history, anec- 
dote, and critical comment, such as might well 
have distinguished a camp-fire gathering of the 
leaders of the two contending armies during 
that struggle. General Gordon is one of the 
few general officers of that war who now survive ; 
and, fortunately for the purposes of such a 
work as this, his opportunities for gathering 
and preserving the ana of the whole period 
have been exceptionally good. Among the first 
to enlist in the Southern army, and achieving 
early promotion and frequent enlargements of 
his field of action, his service continued to the 
very close of the war. He and the men under 
his command were participants in the first battle 
of Bull Run, and held prominent position in 
such contests as Malvern Hill and Antietam ; 
they reached Gettysburg in time to help turn 
the tide of battle on the first day, and took part 
in guarding the Confederate retreat across the 
Potomac : they experienced the full stress of 
the sanguinary fields of the Wilderness and 
Spottsylvania, engineered the surprise which 
the Federals suffered in the morning at Cedar 
Creek, and shared in the flight of the Confed- 
erates at night ; they joined in the last great 
effort of Lee and his men in the works at 
Petersburg, and conceived and carried out the 
capture of Fort Stedman, the last spasm of 
Confederate aggressive action before the sur- 
render. The man of quick wit and keen acu- 
men, who passes successfully through such a 
maze of strenuous experiences, must of neces- 
sity have an entertaining tale to tell, and it has 
been told in this volume with a spirit and in a 
form which will give exceeding pleasure to his 
readers. Sample chapters from this story, 
which have appeared recently in the pages of 
one of the magazines, and have been widely 
read, well illustrate the general character of 
these "Reminiscences." 

There is no asperity in the tone which General 
Gordon assumes in his recitals. The past is 
not forgotten, and it is remembered and dis- 
cussed without apologies ; but it is for the 
United States and her people of the present 
that the former soldier writes, and with a gaze 
turned toward the nation and the nation's peo- 
ple of the future. The leading and dominant 
spirit of the book is a desire to honor and 
glorify the patriotic and honorable manhood 
which struggled through the momentous con- 
test of the Civil War, and without any em- 
phasis upon the color of the uniform with which 
that manhood was clothed. It would be difficult 
to say upon which side those soldiers fought, to 



whose valor or gallantry Gordon would ascribe 
the higher praise. It needs no other acquaint- 
ance with him than that afforded by these re- 
miniscences, to discern in his chivalrous nature 
" That stern joy which warriors feel 
In foemen worthy of their steel." 

There is no false or insincere tone in the lan- 
guage in which he lauds and magnifies the 
American valor which waged the Civil War 
— on the one side successfully, on the other 
without avail. He does not write with the view 
of overlooking or obscuring the issues involved 
in the war ; he states them fairly and temper- 
ately, as follows : 

" The dominating thought of the North and of the 
Sonth may be summarized in a few sentences. The 
South maintained with the depth of religious convic- 
tion that the Union formed under the Constitution was 
a Union of consent and not of force; that the original 
States were not the creatures but the creators of the 
Union; that these States had gained their indepen- 
dence, their freedom, and their sovereignty from the 
mother country, and had not surrendered these on 
entering the Union; that by the express terms of the 
Constitution all rights and powers not delegated were 
reserved to the States; and the South challenged the 
North to find one trace of authority in that Constitu- 
tion for invading and coercing a sovereign State. 

" The North, on the other hand, maintained, with 
the utmost confidence in the correctness of her position, 
that the Union formed under the Constitution was in- 
tended to be perpetual; that sovereignty was a unit 
and could not be divided; that whether or not there 
was any express power granted in that Constitution for 
invading a State, the right of self-preservation was 
inherent in all governments; that the life of the Union 
was essential to the life of liberty ; or, in the words of 
Webster, ' Liberty and union are one and inseparable.' " 

His summary of those issues emphasizes the 
Americanism which he sees distinguishing the 
motives of the actors on both sides. 

" Truth, justice and patriotism unite in proclaiming 
that both sides fought for liberty as bequeathed by the 
Fathers, the one for liberty in the Union of the States, 
the other for liberty in the Independence of the States." 

He does not undertake to argue anew the ques- 
tions which led to the assumption of these 
antagonistic points of view ; he thinks such 
argument would now be useless and superfluous. 
It is rather by way of explanation than argu- 
ment that he refers to the views then held by 
the Southerners, in one instance quoting from 
the speech of a Southern statesman, as indica- 
tive of the education in national politics which 
the Southern soldiers had received. The posi- 
tion of the Southerners was there assumed to 
be one " not of aggression but purely of de- 
fence"; and in support of the assumption of 
sovereignty by the Southern States, reliance 
was placed upon the mythical " declaration of

New York, Khode Island, and Virginia, when 
they entered the Union," that those States had 
reserved something from their obligations to 
the Union. But these suggestions have appar- 
ently no polemic purpose ; they are offered in 
illustration of the author's proposition that the 
conflict was between two antithetic types of one 
original Americanism, and in the same spirit 
in which he finds satisfaction in the reflection 
that the constitution of the " Confederate 
States " was " so nearly like " the "old Ameri- 
can Constitution." The clearest remembrance 
which he retains of the war and its events, and 
the strongest conviction which he entertains 
concerning its results, are that the American 
character was thereby tested, chastened, and 
strengthened ; so that out of the conflict he 
draws reassurance for the future of the Republic. 
" The stability of popular government depends far 
more upon the character, the individual personal char- 
acter, of its people, than it does upon any constitution 
that could be adopted or statutes that could be enacted. 
What would safeguards be worth if the character of the 
people did not sustain and enforce them? The constitu- 
tion would be broken, the laws defied ; riot and anarchy 
would destroy both, and with them the government it- 
self. I am not assuming or suggesting that this coun- 
try is in any present danger of such an experience ; but 
of all the countries on earth this one, with its universal 
suffrage, its divergent and conflicting interests, its im- 
mense expanse of territory, and its large population, 
made up from every class and clime, and still to be in- 
creased in the coming years, is far more dependent than 
any other upon the character of its people. It is a great 
support to our hope for the future and to our confidence 
in the stability of this government, to recall now and 
then some illustration of the combination of virtues 
which make up character, as they gleam with peculiar 
lustre through the darkest hours of our Civil War 
period. That war not only gave the occasion for its 
exhibition, but furnished the food upon which character 
fed and grew strong." 

When an active participant in the Confederate 
war looks upon the past and the future of the 
Republic with such patriotic optimism, we seem 
to be nearing the time when the actors on both 
sides in the great contest can reach a common 
ground from which to observe their own past 
experiences. 

The same calmness of judgment enables 
General Gordon to estimate at their true 
worth the characteristics displayed by Lee, 
Jackson, and others of the Confederate lead- 
ers. His opportunities for knowing and study- 
ing these men were exceptionally good, and 
his portraiture of them is clear and enlighten- 
ing. Lee and Jackson, in particular, will be 
better understood and appreciated than before, 
by those who shall read General Gordon's 



No class of these war-memories is recited 
with a keener zest by General Gordon than 
those in which is manifested the manly and 
knightly courtesy shown by the soldiers on each 
side toward those upon the other. It is appar- 
ently with delight that he fills his pages with 
incidents exhibiting the chivalry of true soldiers ; 
many of them occurring within his own knowl- 
edge, but many others told from hearsay. By 
the same token, the narrator writes himself 
down a man of innate chivalry. Not only in 
the knightly demeanor of officers toward their 
leading antagonists on the battle-field, or when 
capturing prisoners, or under cartel, but in the 
secret visits of both officers and soldiers across 
the lines, in the " swapping " by pickets of news- 
papers and tobacco, in the ceasing of firing in 
unusual contingencies, and in the fair notice 
given of the renewal of hostilities, "Hello, 
there, Johnnies, get into your holes, we're going 
to shoot ! " General Gordon finds the dominance 
of the native American chivalry. But in all 
these, the cynic will probably find, as cynics 
have found heretofore, that it was " a very 
Civil War." 

The purely military comments, descriptions, 
and criticisms in this volume will attract and in- 
terest General Gordon's readers. He pictures 
the opening scenes of the battle of Antietam, 
which, he says, " left its lasting impress upon 
my body as well as upon my memory," in these 
words : 

"Vigorously following up the success achieved at 
South Mountain, McClellan, on the 16th day of Sep- 
tember, 1862, marshalled his veteran legions on the 
eastern hills bordering the Antietam. On the opposite 
slopes, near the picturesque village of Sharpsburg, stood 
the embattled lines of Lee. As these vast American 
armies, the one clad in blue and the other in gray, stood 
contemplating each other from the adjacent hills, flaunt- 
ing their defiant banners, they presented an array of 
martial splendor that was not equalled, perhaps, on any 
other field. It was in marked contrast with other battle- 
grounds. On the open plain, where stood these hos- 
tile hosts in long lines, listening in silence for the signal 
summoning them to battle, there were no breastworks, 
no abatis, no intervening woodlands, nor abrupt hills, 
nor hiding-places, nor impassable streams. The space 
over which the assaulting columns were to march, and 
on which was soon to occur the tremendous struggle, 
consisted of smooth and gentle undulations and a 
narrow valley covered with green grass and growing 
corn. From the position assigned me near the centre 
of Lee's lines, both armies and the entire field were in 
view. The scene was not only magnificent to look 
upon, but the realization of what it meant was deeply 
impressive." 

The author's recollections of Gettysburg pre- 
sent themselves in a series of pictures, of which 
the following is a specimen :

■ The fiercest struggle is now for the possession of 
Little Round Top. Standing on its rugged summit like 
a lone sentinel, is seen an erect but slender form clad in 
the uniform of a Union officer. It is Warren, Meade's 
chief of engineers. With practised eye, he sees at a 
glance that, quickly seized, that rock-ribbed hill would 
prove a Gibraltar amidst the whirling currents of the 
battle, resisting its heaviest shocks. Staff and couriers 
are summoned, who swiftly bear his messages to the 
Union leaders. Veterans from Hancock and Sykes re- 
spond at a ' double-quick.' Around its base, along its 
sides, and away toward the Union right, with the forces 
of Sickles and Hancock, the gray veterans of Long- 
street are in herculean wrestle. Wilcox's Alabamians 
and Barksdale's Mississippians seize a Union battery 
and rush on. The Union lines under Humphreys break 
through a Confederate gap and sweep around Barks- 
dale's left. Wright's Georgians and Perry's Floridians 
are hurled against Humphreys and break him in turn. 
Amidst the smoke and fury, Sickles, with thigh-bone 
shivered, sickens and falls from his saddle into the arms 
of his soldiers. Sixty per cent of Hancock's veterans 
go down with his gallant Brigadiers Willard, Zook, 
Cross, and Brooke. The impetuous Confederate lead- 
ers, Barksdale and Semmes, fall and die, but their places 
are quickly assumed by the next in command. The 
Union forces of Vincent and Weed, with Hazlett's 
artillery, have reached the summit, but all three are 
killed. The apex of Little Round Top is the point of 
deadliest struggle. The day ends, and thus ends the 
battle. As the last rays of the setting sun fall upon 
the summit, they are reflected from the batteries and 
bayonets of the Union soldiers still upon it, with the 
bleeding Confederates struggling to possess it." 

But it should not be supposed that these 
reminiscences are as largely serious as the 
foregoing comments might be taken to inti- 
mate. Our author shines as a raconteur. The 
lighter and more humorous sides of even serious 
situations are always luminous to him, and the 
liveliest and most amusing anecdotes throng 
his pages. The sprightliness of the camp-fire 
enlivens nearly every chapter, and the fun is 
always of that genteel geniality which depends 
in no whit upon vulgarity. The reviewer who 
would give examples of the wit which General 
Gordon enjoys, sufficient to illustrate his capac- 
ity for appreciating the humorous, would be in 
danger of surfeiting his readers with an em- 
barrassment of riches. One anecdote may be 
selected to serve as a specimen, — that of the 
ante-bellum " Debating Society " in Georgia. 
Two waggish youths in the society, chancing 
to be made a committee to select a question 
for debate, determined to amuse themselves by 
choosing a subject expressive of incomprehen- 
sible nonsense, to be debated by themselves 
with profound though mock seriousness. The 
question selected was, " Whether at public 
elections should the votes of faction predomi- 
nate by internal suggestions, or the bias of 
jurisprudence ? " How the leaders debated this 



with " resounding rhetoric and rounded pe- 
riods," how the other boys painfully tried to 
follow the course of the great argument, and 
how the president of the society floundered in 
attempting to " sum up the arguments," will 
be gathered from General Gordon's pages, as 
he tells us how the odd story came to solace 
and amuse his weary hours when convalescing 
from serious wounds received on the field, and 
how it remains one of the well-remembered epi- 
sodes of a sanguinary experience. With such 
medicine as this, it is no wonder that the mer- 
curial spirit of the wounded officer survived all 
the hardships of a prolonged and terrible war, 
to illumine the days of peace in his native land 
with the story of his memorable life.

Some Types of Religious Thought.* 



The books noticed below, diverse as they 
are, nearly all serve to illustrate the fact that 
the religion of the English-speaking peoples is 
undergoing a change. While this movement 
is of course part of one affecting the whole of 
civilization, it is being carried forward inde- 
pendently, in different quarters, and with de- 
cidedly different results. In the course of 
evolution, when physical conditions change, it 
is not usually the most elaborately specialized 
animals which leave descendants. Perfectly 
and minutely adjusted to a given environment, 
these wonders of their time fail utterly when 
confronted by altered circumstances, while 
more plastic and simple creatures succeed. 
The organized religions of the world, regarded 
by themselves, impress one in different degrees 
by their completeness, logical coherence, or vis- 
ible display. In the struggle for existence it 
might readily be supposed that such things as 
these, combined with great antiquity, would 
be causes of success ; but as a matter of fact it

looks rather as if the coming religion would be 
a child of doubt, conflicting opinions, and dis- 
organization. 

Mr. Mallock's work on "Religion as a Cred- 
ible Doctrine, a Study of the Fundamental 
Difficulty," takes up the arguments of various 
religious apologists, and discusses them critic- 
ally at considerable length. To say that the 
criticism is destructive, is to use a mild expres- 
sion ; the theological arguments are pulverized, 
scattered to the four winds, and covered with 
ridicule. It is worth while to illustrate this 
statement by a quotation: 

" When he [the theist] sets out with telling us that 
the purpose of God in creation is most surely and in- 
timately revealed to us in the production of sentient 
creatures, he is thinking of the lives of sentient, of con- 
scious individuals. He is thinking, for example, not of 
sparrows as a species, but of each separate little bird, 
when he says that not one of them falls without its 
maker's knowledge; and it is still more evident that of 
man he is thinking in the same way. The whole mean- 
ing, the essence, of the theist's doctrine of God is his 
doctrine of God's love for the individual human soul. 
Christ did not die, according to the Christian's idea of 
his death, in order to preserve the peculiarities of the 
Teutonic race or the Celtic, or to save the soul of any 
corporate body. The Church, no doubt, is spoken of as 
the divine Bride; but the Church is nothing if not com- 
posed of individuals; and, except as related to the life 
and conduct of the individual, God's love is nothing 
also, as every theist knows. . . . The scientific view 
which our modern apologists appropriate is not even 
analogous to their own. It is a monstrous and horrible 
inversion of it. How does the fact that the weak, the 
vicious, and the criminal transmit their tendencies to 
their descendants with such effect and certainty that 
the latter, if left to themselves, die of their own unfit- 
ness, justify God in having made them unfit at all ? If 
the unfit are thrust into the world, it may well be that 
they should be thrust out of it, and the process of 
thrusting them out may be admirable exercise for the fit; 
but to the unfit themselves, who never asked to be born, 
the God who created them is either a dolt or a monster, 
so far as we judge of him by the light which the process 
of evolution throws upon him" (pp. 172-173). 

The author explains (p. 8) that in speaking of 
religion he assumes it to involve an assent to 
three fundamental propositions : (1) that a 
living God exists who is worthy of our reli- 
gious emotion, (2) that the will of man is free, 
and (3) that his life does not cease with the 
dissolution of this physical organism. After 
showing, for the most part in a lucid and con- 
vincing way, that the arguments advanced by 
theologians in favor of these postulates are 
unsound, he turns round and proceeds to an- 
nihilate Professor Huxley and Mr. Herbert 
Spencer with complete success. In the fol- 
lowing gentle manner is Huxley's " Evolution 
and Ethics " lecture dismissed : 



" None of ' the wretched little curates,' at whose 
apologetics he delighted to sneer, ever committed him- 
self to an argument more transparently and more feebly 
false. In the first place, what is less honest or more 
unscientific than the manner in which he begs the ques- 
tion, by confining the term ' cosmic process,' which 
naturally suggests and includes all the processes of the 
universe, to the single process of selection, or the 
survival of the fittest? And yet on this procedure 
his whole contention depends. He confines the term 
« cosmic ' to this one particular process, in order that 
he may represent any process which is opposed to this 
one, as being a process which is opposed to the cosmic 
also — a process by which, within a cosmos essentially 
natural, man builds up for himself an artificial world 
which is independent of it. To call this pitiable piece 
of card-sharping with words and ideas sophistry is to 
pay it a high compliment" (p. 269). 

Mr. Mallock's final conclusion (to which the 
present reviewer heartily assents) is that we 
may accept the fundamental postulates of 
religion without being in a position to exhibit 
their scientific validity. No genuinely monistic 
philosophy is possible, other than a mere mental 
abstraction. 

" Let us remember that we may know something — 
that we may increase our knowledge indefinitely — of 
many portions of existence; but that by no intellectual 
device can we fit all the portions together. If we try 
to comprehend them all in a single system of philosophy, 
we will find that in explaining one part we have to leave 
another inexplicable ; — that philosophy, in fact, is like 
a coat which we are able to button across our stomach 
only by leaving a broken seam at our back. We must 
learn, in short, with regard to the deeper things of life, 
that the fact of our adopting a creed which involves an 
assent to contradictions is not a sign that our creed is 
useless or absurd, but that the ultimate nature of things 
is for our minds inscrutable" (p. 287). 

The other books before us appear to be of 
minor importance, and may be discussed more 
briefly. In " The Law of Likeness " Dr. David 
Bates shows how, partly through some inter- 
estingly described experiences in West Africa, 
the author was led to abandon a Calvinistic 
type of Christianity and to adopt a spiritual 
creed which did not seem to be contradicted 
by the facts of history, science, and every-day 
experience. " The Heaven of our Hope is dis- 
tinctly foreshadowed by the Kingdom of God 
that is within us. In what we know even 
now, as the life of the spirit — in our higher 
thoughts' appreciation of the manifest opera- 
tion of God ; in the untiring joy of our seeking 
after Him, the evergrowing desire to know His 
Way, and to participate in the fulfilment of 
His Purpose — we have certain revelation of 
the life to come." Thus in this work, as in 
Mr. Mallock's, the justification of religion is. 
found in the subjective field.

" The Essence of Christianity," by Mr. 
William Adams Brown, is an historical study 
of the definitions of Christianity. The author 
seems rather to discount the value of his own re- 
searches as a contribution to religious thought 
when he says at the end : " What the theology 
of the f uttfre will be like in its details it is too 
soon to predict. But of one thing we may be 
sure. It will be a theology for the people. It 
will have its roots deep in life, and will utter 
its message in language so simple and direct 
that a layman as well as the theologian can 
understand it." 

"Divinity and Man," by Mr. W.K. Roberts, 
is stated on the title-page to be " An Interpre- 
tation of Spiritual Law in its Relation to Mun- 
dane Phenomena and to the Ruling Incentives 
and Moral Duties of Man. Together with an 
Allegory Dealing with Cosmic Evolution and 
certain Social and Religious Problems." While 
it contains some good ideas, it appears to me 
to be mainly nonsense. It is recommended to 
certain of the orthodox, as an illustration of 
what some of their own doctrines would look 
like if approached without favorable bias. 

"Jesus' Way," by President DeWitt Hyde 
of Bowdoin College, is an attempt to set forth 
the teaching of Jesus, unhampered by the theo- 
logical trappings which usually cover it. It 
is a reasonable and even inspiring little book, 
though here and there one finds what seems to 
be a false note or an exaggeration. 

"The Spark in the Clod," by the Rev. J. T. 
Sunderland, deals with evolution from the reli- 
gious standpoint, and shows that the tendency 
is from the lower to the higher, that man has 
risen instead of fallen, and that in this fact lies 
our hope for the future. 

"God and the Individual," by Dr. T. B. 
Strong, is a defence of organized religion, 
against such " individualistic " notions as are 
held by Dr. James. There is a great deal about 
the early customs of the church, but from the 
Jamesian standpoint it is to be feared that this 
has " nothing to do with the case." 

" Of Religion " is a little book of " The Arts 
of Life " series, by Mr. R. R. Bowker. The 
author sums up as follows: "And whether we 
think only of the life that now is, or also of the 
life that is to come, whether the pathway of 
being seems to any one of us to lead to the 
shut or to the open door, it is in the supremacy 
of the higher man, in the fulfilment of the su- 
preme art of life, that life on earth is indeed 
worth the living." m _ . _

A Martyr of Science.* 



Every intelligent man or woman must have 
a lively and sympathetic interest in the story 
of the almost superhuman struggles of a great 
genius who, amid severe trials, domestic, phys- 
ical, and religious, made a multitude of epoch- 
making discoveries, any one of which would 
now-a-days command the instant admiration 
and applause of the world. Such a genius 
was Galileo, a satisfactory biography of whom, 
in the English tongue, has now first appeared 
from the pen of Mr. J. J. Fabie and the press 
of James Pott & Co. 

For the past twenty-five years, Professor 
Favaro, of the University of Padua, has de- 
voted himself almost exclusively to the study 
of the life of Galileo, and to the collection of 
his writings. At the present time the Italian 
Government is issuing, under his direction, an 
edition of Galileo's works, in twenty large 
volumes, the first dozen of which have been 
printed. All of the material collected by the 
Italian professor has been courteously placed 
at the service of Mr. Fahie, who has also had 
access to the best of former publications, in- 
cluding the extensive work of Alberi, which 
appeared in sixteen volumes in the years 
1842-56. 

The first twenty-five years of Galileo's life 
are passed over by his biographer in as many 
pages ; in them he is pictured as an ardent, 
disputatious, and headstrong young man whose 
refusal to take with easy compliance the cap- 
sules of Aristotelian dogmatics prescribed for 
him from day to day by the University pro- 
fessors brought him into great disfavor with 
those worthies, and earned him the sobriquet 
of " The Wrangler." That some of this spirit 
may be attributed to heredity is probable from 
the following extract from the writings of his 
father, Vincenzio : 

" I, on the contrary, wish to be allowed freely to 
question and freely to answer without any sort of adula- 
lation, as well becomes those who are sincerely in search 
of truth." 

After several unsuccessful endeavors to 
secure a University professorship, Galileo 
obtained such an office at Pisa in July, 1589, 
before he was twenty-six years old. The salary 
was only sixty-five dollars per annum, but he 
was expected to augment it by giving private 
lessons. Here were made his famous experi- 
ments on falling bodies, the results of which

led to excessive bitterness on the part of his 
Aristotelian colleagues. After three years the 
situation became intolerable, and he resigned, 
accepting soon after a similar place at Padua. 
This professional seat he occupied for eighteen 
years, displaying extraordinary ability and 
versatility. This period is specially marked 
by his re-invention of the telescope, and his 
discovery with it of the mountains of the moon, 
the moons of Jupiter, the "servitors" of 
Saturn, etc. Our author gives some facsimiles 
of Galileo's MSS., showing his drawings and 
notes on the satellites of Jupiter, and his 
sketches of Saturn. A common story about 
his observations of Saturn is that when the 
appearances now known to be rings vanished 
(because turned edgewise to us) Galileo was 
so disturbed that he never directed his tele- 
scope to the planet again. But the researches 
of Favaro have completely disproved this, 
showing that Galileo observed Saturn assidu- 
ously, and drew some sketches so true that it 
is astonishing that he did not perceive what 
the very drawings plainly suggested, namely, 
that the planet was surrounded by a ring. 

These discoveries brought Galileo great re- 
nown, as well as much trouble from the con- 
tinual necessity of defending them against the 
malignant attacks of his enemies. A snare 
was skilfully laid for him, and he was led to 
express opinions as to the bearings of his scien- 
tific doctrines on the Scriptures. Thus he was 
brought into direct conflict with the Roman 
Curia, and the hand of the Inquisition was laid 
upon him. For thirty long years he was never 
free from the pressure of this iron hand. Mr. 
Fahie has endeavored to give a faithful account 
of the happenings of these tedious years, quot- 
ing freely from official documents and private 
letters. 

Upon the black background of Galileo's suf- 
ferings from physical illness and mental dis- 
tress there stands out the lovely figure of his 
daughter, the nun Maria Celeste, who corre- 
sponded with him continually, and brightened 
the hours of his gloom by her loving devotion. 
She continually addresses him as " Dearest 
Lord and Father," and is full of solicitude for 
his welfare : the other nuns have their patron 
saints, but she needs none, since she has her 
father to confide in ; in one letter she expresses 
a desire to die, so that in the next world her 
prayers for him may have greater efficacy. 

This ministering angel passed away when her 
father was seventy years of age ; he felt that he 
was soon to follow ; he seemed to hear her call- 



ing him ; but eight long years intervened be- 
fore his weary spirit took its flight. 

Having given an admirable account of 
Galileo's private life and of his various dis- 
coveries, Mr. Fahie adds a description of the 
exquisite " Tribuna di Galileo," erected in 
Florence sixty-odd years ago, in which are 
stored priceless instruments and other relics 
of the great master and his times. He also 
appends a full bibliography and a short index. 
The volume is illustrated by about twenty full- 
page plates and a few small cuts, and is very 
legibly printed. Herbert A. Howe. 



Recent Discussions in Private 
and Public Finance.* 



The controversy over certain proposed currency 
and fiscal reforms, which has been waged with un- 
parallelled vigor during the last decade by certain 
economic writers as well as in the public press, has 
doubtless led more than one timid observer to the 
belief that, within the fields of public and private 
finance at least, scientific conclusions are impossible 
and speculation is the only guide. Tet students of 
economics will doubtless agree that these financial 
controversies have had other than merely negative 
results. Not only have scientific research and 
popular argumentation done much to free the intel- 
lectual atmosphere from certain mists which had 
befogged the public mind, but, as one after another 
cloud has been cleared away, the investigators them- 
selves have discovered much solid ground on which 
they could meet. 

Let us take as an example the question of bi- 
metallism. While the reviewer has no statistics to 
support his assertion, he ventures the statement that 
if ten years ago a poll of economic teachers and 
writers in this country had been taken, it would have 
been found that a majority of them were inclined to 
favor, if not openly to support, international bi- 
metallism. To-day, that poll would undoubtedly 
show a large majority to be, for one reason or an- 
other, in opposition to such a policy. Indeed, within 
the last few months the leading scientific advocate 
of international bimetallism in this country has pub- 
licly declared that certain changes in the production 
of the precious metals which have taken place within

recent years have caused him to change his former 
views concerning the necessity of a doable standard. 

Such a change in the trend of scientific opinion 
as well as in monetary legislation has doubtless 
caused satisfaction to no one more than to that vet- 
eran economist, Prof essor James Laurence Laughlin, 
who for some years carried on, almost alone, the 
battle among scientific students in behalf of the gold 
standard. Since 1886, when the first edition of his 
"History of Bimetallism" appeared, he has con- 
tinued his advocacy of the single gold standard for 
this country, in various articles, books, and reports, 
which have without doubt aided materially in the 
attainment of that end, as well as in establishing the 
author's right to be considered as America's leading 
authority in monetary science. Not content with his 
former achievements, Professor Laughlin has now 
planned a series of works covering the entire field 
of money and banking, which is so comprehensive 
in its scope and so thorough-going in its plan of 
execution that it must constitute the author's life- 
work ; indeed, he confesses that he has doubts as 
to whether " the plan is ever finished." 

It is the first volume of this opus magnum, which 
the author entitles "The Principles of Money," 
which is now before us. The author believes that 
much of the confusion and uncertainty that have 
resulted from the attempts to state monetary theories 
and to carry them into practice has arisen from the 
failure to discern clearly the principles that govern 
the value of money and determine the prices of com- 
modities. Especially is this true of those writers 
who adhere to the classical quantity theory of money, 
viz., that " the value of money, other things being 
the same, varies inversely as its quantity." Accord- 
ingly, Professor Laughlin's statement of the prin- 
ciples of money is very largely devoted to a refuta- 
tion of this false doctrine, as he considers it to be. 
Indeed, his book might well have been entitled, 
"The Quantity Theory of Money," since there is 
scarcely a chapter in it which does not attempt to 
point out the false logic involved in this theory or 
the failure of the theory to explain the facts of ac- 
tual life. 

In the first chapter, which deals with " The Func- 
tions of Money," the author takes sharp issue with 
Professor Menger, who maintained that the func- 
tion of money as a medium of exchange antedated 
its use as a standard of values. This our author 
denies, and he submits considerable historical evi- 
dence to support him in his contention. The ques- 
tion of priority is not important in itself; but as 
Professor Laughlin attributes much of the false 
reasoning of the quantity theorists to the failure to 
distinguish between these two functions, his own 
treatment receives logical support from the claim 
that the prime importance of money as a standard 
of values was recognized from the time of its first 
use. His lengthy review of the Standard question 
leads him to reject on grounds of abstract justice, 
as well as of practicability, all the standards pro- 
posed by various writers for securing justice in the 



case of deferred payments, such as the multiple 
standard, the corn standard, the labor standard, etc. 
All of them, as well as gold and silver, fail, because 
they all assume that justice can be done by regu- 
lating prices through changes in the quantity of the 
circulating medium. " A perfectly just standard 
of deferred payments is not possible," the author 
concludes. The solution of the problem is to be 
found in the realms of expediency ; and expediency 
has decided in favor of the gold standard. 

The author's treatment of Credit is decidedly 
original, and so complete as almost to confuse the 
reader. He finds the essence of credit to be, not 
confidence but the element of futurity. Its basis 
is goods, not money ; and its great service to a com- 
munity is that it furnishes the machinery by which 
a large part of general wealth, or goods, is converted 
into general purchasing power. Distinguishing be- 
tween " normal credit," which is " the coinage of 
goods, or property, into present means of payment 
in amount no greater than the value of the market- 
able goods, or property, owned by the borrower," 
and "abnormal credit," in which the amount is 
greater than the value of the goods owned, the author 
proceeds to show that normal credit merely enlarges 
the field of exchange by increasing purchasing power 
to the full extent of the bankable property. It is 
the same as if there had been an increased produc- 
tion of goods, and does not affect in any way the 
general level of prices. Abnormal credit, on the 
other hand, creates a false demand for goods. It 
raises the general level of prices the same as if the 
demand had been genuine, and a supply of goods 
is brought forward in consequence. Then the bubble 
is pricked ; the demand is seen not to be real, and 
the supply of goods is in excess of real demands. 
Liquidation follows, at prices which will not cover 
the amount of the obligations. It is in this way 
that crises are produced, according to Professor 
Laughlin. 

Several years ago, in reviewing the second volume 
of Professor Nicholson's "Political Economy," 
(The Dial, June 16, 1898), the present reviewer 
called attention to the fact that this author's defense 
of the quantity theory laid especial emphasis on the 
claim that the growth of credit transactions in mod- 
ern times required an increase, pari passu, of me- 
tallic money to act as reserves. Professor Laughlin 
says of this argument : 

" The effect of an expanding use of credit in demanding 
more specie reserves has had a very slight effect upon the 
world's value of gold and through it upon prices. . . . The 
reserves in cash are used as a test of, not as a limit to, the 
amount of currency which can be issued. . . . The order of 
events is this : first, a transaction in goods, next the appear- 
ance of credit forms arising out of the transactions ; then, the 
collection of that amount of specie found by experience to be 
needed to keep np a continuous test of the solvency of the 
credit in terms of the standard." 

In his treatment of " Deposit Currency " Profes- 
sor Laughlin follows the lead of the late Professor 
Dunbar, borrowing, indeed, from that author the 
argument that the great use of deposits as currency 



310 



THE DIAL. 



[Nov. 1, 



to-day had dispelled all dangers of contraction, as 
well as rendering of little account the gains, made 
much of by many writers, from having an elastic 
currency. The only gain would be the providing, 
for small transactions, of a medium of exchange 
more convenient than coin. 

To the ordinary reader there will seem to be 
something like false logic in Professor Laughlin's 
argument that while " the loans a bank can make 
are limited by the amount of its reserves," and " a 
fall in reserves restricts the purchasing power which 
can be created in the form of deposit currency, fol- 
lowing from loans based on goods," yet " it is not 
relevant to the main question to say that the de- 
posit currency is limited by money reserves." With- 
out arguing here the question as to which is cause 
and which is effect, when the relation of reserves, 
loans, and deposits is so intimate as the foregoing 
sentences indicate, is it not within the truth to ob- 
serve that one of these factors acts as a limit to the 
other? Professor Laughlin's explanation of the 
paradox is that, " while at any one moment the 
amount of reserves actually held does limit the then 
existing loans and deposits, yet it is perfectly clear 
that, as more good loans are offered year by year, 
the banks will provide more gold by changing a frac- 
tional part of their increasing resources — which 
rise pari passu with their liabilities — for addi- 
tional supplies of gold." Yet is not this just what 
the quantity theorists urge, viz., that an increased 
use of credit demands an increased amount of 
specie? The safe argument, and the most convinc- 
ing, is of course the one on which all mono-metal- 
lists fall back, viz., that the increased production 
of gold since 1850 has so enlarged the volume of 
that metal that one need not fear that bank re- 
serves, as well as other monetary demands for 
specie, cannot be met from this supply. 

The author's elaborate treatment of tables of 
priees and index-numbers seems scarcely necessary 
to the development of his subject, or even to prove 
his point that " many of the suggestions as to the 
measurement of prices have a squint toward some 
means of arriving at changes in the value of money, 
— and the causes thereof, — and they seem to imply 
the acceptance of the quantity theory of money." 
Suffice it to say that the author's conclusion is in 
favor of the simple unweighted average, as he says : 
" It is more important to have a large number of 
goods quoted in the price-tables than to attempt 
accurate calculations of the proper weights to be 
attached to each article." 

In his lengthy chapter on the history of the 
quantity theory, with its numerous references to 
and quotations from many writers, past and present, 
perhaps the most common error which our author 
discovers is the confusion of money as a standard 
of values with its function as a means of payment. 
Whenever the first function is held in mind, the 
reasoning of these writers seems to be sound ; but 
when they begin to treat the amount of money in a 
country as the total demand for goods, a false theory 



of prices is developed. In his elaboration of " The 
True Theory of Prices," he shows that the general 
level of prices is determined by the same forces, 
constituting supply and demand, which go to deter- 
mine the price of any single article. Goods are 
exchanged for goods. Their value is expressed in 
terms of gold ; and sometimes, but not always, gold 
or some other article acts as a medium of exchange. 
If gold is the standard commodity in which prices 
are expressed, all exchanges, no matter what the 
medium of exchange may be, refer themselves to 
this standard commodity whose value is determined 
in the manner already described. Both the mone- 
tary and the non-monetary demands for gold aid in 
fixing its price, which is in nowise dependent on the 
quantity of the circulating medium. In fact, the 
adjustment of value between gold and goods, — 
what the author terms " the evaluation process," — 
has been effected antecedent to the exchange process. 
" The quantity of the media of exchange is a result, 
not a cause, of the evaluation between gold and 
goods, and therefore cannot have been the means 
of fixing prices." The real nature of this exchange 
process is well illustrated in international trade, 
where it is universally recognized that the quantity 
theory in its usual form does not hold ; that goods 
are exchanged for goods, and usually no medium of 
exchange other than bills of exchange are used. 
Therefore a movement of gold, so far from being 
the causes of changes in the general price-level and 
thus causing exports or imports, if it does take place, 
is a result of these movements of goods. " The 
arrival of a gold balance in any one commercial 
country no more lowers the world value of gold in 
the markets of that country than would the price 
of the existing supply of wheat be lowered if one 
of the places of storing wheat should be changed 
from Chicago to Buffalo ; for if the existing demand 
for wheat and the existing supply of wheat remain 
unchanged, it is only a matter of convenience where 
it is stored." 

Naturally enough, Professor Laughlin does not 
agree with the late President Walker, and other 
writers, that an increase in the amount of money 
by gradually raising prices acts as a stimulus to in- 
dustry and brings prosperity. The only case where 
general prosperity results from such an increase, he 
believes, is when, as in the case of the great gold 
discoveries, the increase of the standard metal is 
itself an increase of actual wealth, just the same as 
in the case of a discovery of iron or coal deposits. 
In any other case, the increase of the medium of 
exchange, if it affects prices at all, does so by means 
of depreciation, and the false stimulus given to 
industry is followed by acute depression. Only 
the shrewd speculator, who knows that the high 
prices were temporary, has gained. Holding that 
the fall of prices in the last quarter-century has 
been due to progress in the industrial arts, which 
has increased the productivity of industries, the 
author asserts that " through the general decline of 
prices the laboring classes have, as a matter of fact, 



1903.] 



THE DIAL,

profited by the tremendous industrial progress of 
the world." In regard to the amount of money 
needed by a country, Professor Langhlin's advice to 
legislators may well be quoted : " First assure the 
permanency of the standard, then remove all shadow 
of doubt as to the immediate convertibility of the 
medium of exchange into that standard, and the 
expansion and contraction of the media of exchange 
(i. e., the currency) can be, with confidence, left to 
take care of itself." 

Professor Scott's work on " Money and Bank- 
ing " is far less ambitious in character than the one 
just reviewed. The author's main purpose was to 
furnish a good elementary treatise on these subjects 
for use as a text in colleges and universities. This he 
has succeeded in doing. His definitions are simple 
and clear, and his statements of monetary principles 
are usually exact. The treatment of Gresham's 
law, and the explanation of the reasons why gold 
and silver and paper concurrently circulate in this 
country, are especially good. It is unfortunate that 
the author has not always made use of the latest 
reports, as there are numerous inaccuracies in his 
statements of facts, especially in his description of 
the coinage systems of the chief commercial coun- 
tries. Perhaps the most striking feature of the 
book, and that which gives it especial value as a 
text, is the amount of space given over to a descrip- 
tion of the forms, processes, and methods of ex- 
change. This attention to commercial processes 
and machinery is doubtless due in large measure 
to the author's recently acquired interest in higher 
commercial education, and it certainly makes the 
book a valuable means of giving instruction in the 
practical aspects of these subjects. There is com- 
paratively little attention given to theory. Profes- 
sor Scott, like Professor Laughlin, expresses his 
disbelief in the quantity theory of money, which he 
asserts " will not bear analysis and the tests of logic 
and facts." He claims that the doctrine of demand 
and supply is only a description " of a process 
through which the value-determining forces work," 
and not an explanation of the way prices are de- 
termined. He rests his theory of prices entirely 
upon the value given to the commodity standard 
by the estimation of the people who have made it 
the standard, because it has proved to be the most 
useful for this purpose. Price is simply "the 
numerical expression of the ratio of exchange be- 
tween the value of the standard and that of com- 
modities." The author's survey of the banking 
systems in the leading countries closes with a com- 
parison of the free banking systems of the United 
States and Canada with the centralized systems of 
Europe. Though acknowledging that any discus- 
sion of the respective merits of the two systems 
must be carried on in the light of the actual condi- 
tions and experiences of the people concerned, the 
author nevertheless favors the free banking system 
under American conditions. The Canadian system 
of note- issue he regards as ideally the best, but 
thinks " it would probably be difficult to employ it 



in a country like the United States, on account of 
the responsibility which it places upon the stronger 
banks for the conduct of the weaker." The chap- 
ter on " The Theory of Bimetallism " seems to the 
reviewer the weakest in the book. The author 
states the theory of the bimetallists fairly enough, 
and apparently accepts their argument concerning 
the compensatory action of the double standard as 
sound doctrine, " admitted by all." His fault with 
the theory lies in his belief that the dearer metal 
would still continue to be used as the standard in 
the case of long-time contracts at an enhanced 
valuation as compared to the cheaper metal. But 
does not the bimetallic theory assume that a cer- 
tain quantity of money is needed in order to main- 
tain prices at a given level ? — in other words, the 
quantity theory which Professor Scott has rejected. 
The closing chapter, on " The History of Bimetal- 
lism," affords a more cogent argument against the 
bimetallic standard than does Professor Scott's 
theoretical treatment. 

For many readers, more progress will be made 
toward an understanding of our present monetary 
situation, as well as of our fiscal system, by turning 
from these theoretical controversies to Professor 
Dewey's admirable historical survey of our financial 
experiences as a nation. The need of such a work 
was imperative, and those persons who knew the 
author's reputation for thoroughness greeted with 
delight the publishers' announcement. Nor have 
the earlier expectations been disappointed. It is 
surprising how much information has been packed 
into these five hundred pages of text, and that, too, 
in such a way as to preserve a pleasant narrative. 
Each chapter is equipped with a full bibliography, 
and other helpful aids are found in the introduction 
and appendix. The statistics are carefully pre- 
pared and intelligently and scientifically arranged, 
— no easy matter when dealing with financial af- 
fairs, where systems of accounting and classifications 
are constantly changing. The diagrams also are 
very skilfully drawn, and are truly helpful in under- 
standing the trend of fiscal affairs. The author 
does not undertake to point out the mistakes in our 
fiscal policy, bat seeks rather to interpret the past 
in the light of the experiences of that time. While 
this is undoubtedly a safe policy to pursue, and may 
be of some advantage to the teacher who desires to 
use the book in his classes and yet desires to put 
his own interpretation on financial happenings, it is 
a gource of regret that the very obvious lessons 
furnished by some chapters in our financial history 
could not have been indicated by a wise guide for 
the benefit of the immature reader. Departing 
somewhat from scientific definitions of the word 
Finance, Professor Dewey makes financial history 
broad enough to include some consideration of our 
monetary systems. This is almost a matter of 
necessity, rather than of deliberate choice, since our 
monetary legislation has been so interwoven with 
our fiscal policy that an attempt to separate them 
for treatment would lead to wrong conclusions.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



There is, unfortunately, not space here to review 
even hastily all the chapters of this hook, and we 
are obliged to content ourselves with a very brief 
reference to a few of the main incidents in the nar- 
rative. The continental currency, which is so often 
assailed, Professor Dewey calls the "culminating 
incident in a half-century of financial experience," 
and he rightly holds that the criticism of such issues 
should not be based on "what is possible among a 
people properly grounded in the principles of mon- 
etary experience," but should proceed from a know- 
ledge of the views held by the politicians of the time 
concerning paper money, and from a consideration 
of the lack of power in Congress to adopt any other 
expedient. The author's review of Hamilton's ad- 
ministration of the Treasury is on the whole favor- 
able to the Secretary. He admits that Hamilton's 
management of the debt was not successful, but he 
agrees with Professor Dunbar in the claim that the 
reliance on sinking funds was not due to Hamilton's 
belief that " compound interest could be made to 
supply the place of an adequate revenue." His mis- 
take was merely due to his relying on a surplus 
when no such surplus, in fact, appeared. Gallatin, 
on the other hand, receives less commendation. He 
is accused of a vacillating policy, especially in his 
attitude toward the necessity of internal duties du- 
ring the war. There is no doubt that Gallatin's 
policy was less aggressive than that of Hamilton. 
He had taken office, committed to a policy of re- 
trenchment in expenditures and a reduction of tax- 
ation. His advocacy of internal taxes at times, and 
his reluctance to lay them at other times, was due 
to no change of policy, but to necessity, or the 
absence of it; while Hamilton favored an exten- 
sion of the Federal fiscal system for political rea- 
sons. Gallatin's failures were in large measure due 
to the lack of financial acumen on the part of his 
superiors in office, and to the jealousy of his party 
allies. 

The author is somewhat of an apologist for Sec- 
retary Chase. He admits that Chase was not a stu- 
dent of finance, but points out that his appointment 
was similar in this respect to preceding ones, made 
from among the leading politicians of the day. He 
makes much of Chase's inherent dislike of paper 
money, and but little of his weakness in finally ac- 
cepting the dictation of Congress in this matter. He 
calls the issuance of legal tender a " striking illus- 
tration of the unsympathetic relations of a Cabinet 
minister with the legislative branch," and pronounces 
it " a remarkable commentary upon the methods of 
financial legislation at this period," but apparently 
does not consider that this lack of sympathy was 
due to a distrust on the part of Congress of Chase's 
ability as a fiscal leader. The long and at times 
bitter controversy which took place at the close of 
the war in regard to the question as to whether the 
United States bonds could be redeemed in green- 
backs, and as to whether or not these bonds were, 
or should be, liable to taxation by the States, shows 
clearly the difficulties involved in creating any form 



of government investments which rests on a differ- 
ent basis than other property. It inevitably creates 
a privileged class, and, even though this privilege 
may have been purchased by an acceptance of lower 
rates of interest at the time, this fact is soon lost 
sight of, while the enjoyment of the privilege is a 
fact which is constantly forcing itself upon the 
public attention. 

Professor Dewey falls into the popular delusion, 
though in an exaggerated degree, in attributing the 
railway legislation in the Western States to the 
Granger agitation. That the two movements had 
a common origin in the discontent of the farmer, 
is not to be doubted ; but as a matter of fact, in 
Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, — the States chiefly 
responsible for this regulative legislation, — the 
Granger movement followed rather than preceded 
the effort to control rates through the legislatures. 
The chapters dealing with the silver and tariff 
legislation of the '90 's has been handled in a 
scholarly manner, and with an effort to give an 
unprejudiced account and to let the facts speak for 
themselves. Perhaps for this very reason, the sim- 
ple recital of the occurrences makes the strongest 
possible argument against the currency inflation of 
this period. The treatment of the Spanish War 
period, and of the more recent events, seems less 
satisfactory. Apparently the author was unwilling 
to pass judgment on matters that have scarcely 
become history. 

The history of the Second Bank of the United 
States constitutes probably the most important 
topic in the financial, if not the political, history of 
this country between the close of the second war 
with England and the outbreak of the Civil War. 
There are doubtless few students of either economics 
or history who have felt that our information in re- 
gard to this famous institution was such as to en- 
able us to say with any degree of certainty as to 
just how great were its services as a fiscal machine 
to the United States government, or even as to 
whose feet, Andrew Jackson's or Nicholas Bid- 
die's, should be laid the charge of having destroyed 
it. All students, therefore, will welcome the care- 
ful work of Professor Catterall on this subject, 
especially as its author has had the advantage of 
using some hitherto unused material, viz., the man- 
uscript correspondence and papers of the Bank's 
most famous president, Nicholas Biddle. But 
though the use of this material has thrown much 
light on the history and management of the Bank, 
we cannot say that it has changed in any consider- 
able degree our former views as to the wisdom of 
its management or the extent of its political influ- 
ence. In spite of the fact that the evidence gath- 
ered by Professor Catterall proves that Mr. Biddle 
possessed many claims to be called a brilliant finan- 
cier, it also goes to show that he was an unsafe 
leader; and the judgment of Mr. Horace White, 
that " nobody at the present day considers Biddle a 
good banker," is sustained. Neither is our belief 
that the Bank meddled in politics, to its own and 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

the country's detriment, shaken. It is true that the 
author has shown that Biddle entered politics very 
reluctantly, and that the Bank was drawn into the 
political arena and was obliged to fight for its ex- 
istence ; it nevertheless remains true that it exerted 
a dangerous if not corrupt influence in political 
affairs, and that if Jackson's attack was based on 
ignorance, Biddle's resistance to it led him into 
measures of a purely vindictive sort, and such as 
were harmful to the public interests. One impor- 
tant point has been cleared up beyond controversy, 
and that is that Henry Clay had very little to do with 
the Bank's attitude toward the administration. Bid- 
die first attempted to keep out of politics altogether; 
then, seeing that this was impossible, he endeavored 
to win the support of the administration by various 
friendly tactics, and only as a last resort he very re- 
luctantly joined the National Republicans in their 
war on Jackson and his political advisers. It is this 
fact, that the Bank was forced into politics against 
the will and strenuous efforts of its autocratic presi- 
dent, which causes us to hesitate to accept Professor 
Catterall'i conclusion that there can be no reason for 
asserting that a central bank which plays so impor- 
tant a part in the financial and commercial life of 
England, France, Germany, etc., would not be of 
equal value to the United States ; and a careful read- 
ing of his own work does not allow us to accept his 
further statement that "the Bank possessed no politi- 
cal power." The value of the central bank to the 
governments of the countries named needs not be 
questioned, and it may even be admitted that simi- 
lar services could be rendered by a central bank to 
the United States government; but the question of 
the desirability of such an institution is one to be 
decided on in view of many circumstances, political 
as well as fiscal. It can scarcely be doubted that a 
President hostile to banking monopolies, — like Mr. 
Bryan, for instance, — would feel it incumbent on 
him to interfere with the management of a fiscal in- 
stitution of this sort ; and it is also easy to infer that 
such interference and hostility would cause the of- 
ficials of such an institution to oppose such a policy 
by participating in politics if necessary. Nor will 
all authorities acknowledge Professor Catterall's 
claim that " a great bank with a large capital under 
its control can meet local demands much more easily 
and safely than a small bank." We have already 
mentioned Professor Scott's preference for the "free 
banking system." The truth of the matter is that 
the knowledge of banking is so much greater to- 
day, and other conditions are so different from 
what they were in 1836, that the history of the Sec- 
ond Bank of the United States does not throw much 
light on the question as to whether or not a central- 
ized banking system would now be a good thing in 
this country. That such a bank would be more 
conservatively managed than the Second Bank was 
under Jones, or even under Biddle, goes without 
saying; on the other hand, the state and private 
banks are to-day immensely superior to those of 
Jackson's day. 



Miss Breckinridge, in her work on " Legal 
Tender," has endeavored to discover through a 
study of English and American monetary history, 
(1) what organ of government has exercised the 
power of conferring on money the legal tender 
quality; (2) what kinds of money have had the 
legal tender quality bestowed on them ; and (3) 
why this power has been bestowed. The answer 
to the first question is that it was originally a royal 
prerogative exercised in a nearly arbitrary manner, 
in spite of some protests on the part of the Com- 
mons, from 1066 until the period of the Common- 
wealth. The courts having declared certain coins 
lawful money, debtors were obliged to receive them 
at their legal value in settlement of debts, even 
when these were contracted at a time prior to the 
declaring of the coins " lawful and current money." 
This decision in the case of " Mixt Monies " (43d 
Elizabeth) has formed the basis of subsequent de- 
cisions in both the English and American courts. 
In regard to the much debated question as to 
whether or not the framers of the Federal Con- 
stitution intended to prohibit the emission of bills 
of credit having legal tender power, the author 
holds that the Convention itself intended to leave 
the matter in doubt. 

"All that can be said as to the interpretation of that 
silence is that, although there was a strong and well-nigh 
universal dread of paper issues, there was a stronger dread 
of too narrowly limiting the powers of the new legislature; 
and that there was neither a very definite nor a unanimous 
opinion as to the effect of striking oat the clause, or as to the 
extent of the power granted." 

Professor Dewey, in the work already reviewed, 
arrives at practically the same conclusion. Arguing 
from the legal maxim, expressio unites est exclusio 
alterius, Miss Breckinridge claims that the act of 
1873, which prohibited the further coinage of the 
silver dollar and stated the legal tender of the gold 
coins and that of the subsidiary silver, by its failure 
to mention the silver dollar took away its legal 
tender quality. In this opinion she is not sup- 
ported by her teacher, Professor Laughlin, whose 
chapter "On the Origin and History of Legal 
Tender " is in the main a lengthy summary of Miss 
Breckinridge's work. The results of the author's 
study as applied to the most important question of 
this character which has ever come before the 
courts of this country, namely, the legality of the 
Legal Tender acts of Congress during the Civil 
War, are opposed to the final decision of the Su- 
preme Court. The bases of this decision, she says, 
" are large considerations of public policy, of con- 
stitutional interpretations, of judicial policy, rather 
than strictly legal considerations. The power to 
bestow the quality of being a tender in private 
transactions has been adjudged an incident to sov- 
ereign powers vested in Congress similar to the 
ancient prerogative money power of the English 
Crown." Even stronger than this is her statement 
in the concluding chapter, that " by an extraordi- 
nary departure from both legislative and judicial 
precedents, an act as tyrannical as any act of 



314

Henry VIII. in dealing with his coins found legis- 
lative and judicial sanction." 

It is interesting to compare with this the opinions 
on this question of two leading authors whom we 
have already quoted. Professor Laughlin is even 
more emphatic than Miss Breckinridge in his disap- 
proval of the decision. 

" The arguments of the Court in the last legal-tender case, 
followed to its logical conclusion makes the existence of a 
written constitution of no effect, and breaks ' down the bar- 
riers ' which separate a government of limited from one of 
unlimited powers. The people of the United States are no 
longer protected from the medisevalism of unlimited power 
over money by any guarantees except those of an enlightened 
public opinion." 

Professor Dewey, on the other hand, expresses 
himself as satisfied with the decision in these words : 

"Popular judgment on the whole was favorable; lawyers 
and constitutional commentators were slowly coming to the 
conclusion that the interpretation of the Constitution must 
rest upon a broader basis than that of the debates of 1787."

Briefs on New Books. 

Leading figures L . a8t January, Colonel T. W. Hig- 
in American ginson gave a course or lectures be- 

uterature. f ore ^he Lowell Institute upon the 

subject of American literature. " Their essential 
plan was that of concentrating attention on leading 
figures, instead of burdening the memory with a great 
many minor names and data." Colonel Higginson 
has now, with the help of Mr. H. W. Boynton, recast 
these lectures into a book intended (although by no 
means exclusively) for the use of schools, and en- 
titled "A Reader's History of American Litera- 
ture" (Houghton). The work falls into ten chapters, 
and is illustrated by autograph letters in facsimile 
and by a few old title-pages. The autograph letter 
from Emerson to the author affords a characteristic 
illustration of the serene optimism of the Concord 
sage. The letter is dated 1864, and its recipient is 
lying in the hospital, his usefulness as a soldier being 
at an end. And Emerson writes him cheerfully as 
follows : " If we lose you from the field, it is excel- 
lent to have a second and better arm. You will 
come back to so many old studies with the basis and 
the rhetoric of new experience. So I am forced to 
wish you joy in any view I take of your position." 
The special interest in this book is supplied by the 
reminiscent and personal element provided by the 
senior author. Its special defects arise from the 
same cause, for both the enthusiasms and the preju- 
dices of Colonel Higginson find free expression. 
As a consequence of the enthusiasms, we take for 
granted the somewhat exaggerated estimates of 
Margaret Fuller, Helen Hunt Jackson, and Emily 
Dickinson ; ae an illustration of the prejudices, we 
may cite the astonishing opinion that " no one ever 
did more than Poe to lower the tone of literary 
criticism in this country." We note the inaccuracy 
that " in 1774 the first and second Continental Con- 



gresses met " in Philadelphia ; and we would sug- 
gest the fact that Bryant was still living as the 
probable explanation of the omission of his name 
from the ninth edition of the " Encyclopaedia Brit- 
annica." For the readable qualities and the literary 
charm of this book we have only praise ; Colonel 
Higginson could not be dull if he tried, and his 
collaborator is a writer whose work is always done 
intelligently and gracefully. 

Literary, political, A gentleman's essays for gentle- 
and biographical men's reading — so one might char- 
mUceiianiei. acterize Sir Mountstuart E. Grant 

Duff's "Out of the Past" (Dutton). These two 
volumes of papers and addresses, by the author of 
"Notes from a Diary," contain some things worth 
preserving, and others, in the shape of book-reviews 
and brief obituary notices, that call less urgently 
for republication in book form. In matters of 
Church and State the author shows himself much 
at home. His article on " Manning and the Catholic 
Reaction," reprinted from the "Edinburgh Review," 
is an admirable summary. The writer's breadth of 
view and freedom from bigotry is indicated by his 
approving reference, elsewhere, to Henry of Na- 
varre, who "became a Catholic and remained a 
Protestant." Years of service in the Colonial Of- 
fice, in the House of Commons, and as Governor of 
Madras, have so richly stored the author's mind 
that his septuagenarian reminiscences cannot fail 
to entertain and instruct. " Recollections of the 
House of Commons, 1858-1881," and chapters on 
Dean Stanley and Walter Bagehot, both friends of 
his, are, with the essay already named, perhaps the 
best things in the collection. We note with ap- 
proval what he has to say against aggressive terri- 
torial expansion, against militarism, and against 
protection. But when, turning from politics and 
economics, he takes Matthew Arnold to task for 
rating Emerson's essays as the most important 
prose work done in English in this century, and 
protests that he himself can find nothing in Em- 
erson's prose which he "should even put alongside 
the Hyperion of his friend and neighbour Long- 
fellow," we must part company. An incidental cen- 
sure of buckram binding for books will meet with 
the disapproval of all who have had experience of 
the undurability of leather and ordinary cloth. 
But his own volumes, that is the two under review, 
are well bound in parchment and pasteboard.

ginning of the independence of the American col- 
onies must be sought, not in the era of 1760, but 
from the very foundation of each colony. In South 
Carolina, this evolution took the shape of a pro- 
longed contest between the representatives of the

proprietary or prerogative interests and the repre- 
sentatives of the masses. These differences were 
to a large extent reflexes of the contest in the Old 
World between prerogative and people. The con- 
stant popular encroachment upon the proprietary 
faction in South Carolina culminated in the polit- 
ical and peaceful revolution of 1719, which con- 
verted the province from a proprietary into a royal 
colony. The contest is presented in the various 
forms it assumed, such as the quit-rents and the 
land frauds, together with the universal and ever- 
present dispute between Governor and Assembly 
over the public finances. One chapter gives a clear 
and readable description of the machinery of a 
colonial government in the province in its various 
functions. The chief weakness in the system is 
found to lie in the impossibility of instituting gov- 
ernment in the backwoods in the form devised in 
councils of the Old World and promulgated in 
commissions, statutes, and instructions. It was to 
be supposed that Mr. McCrady had said the last 
word on colonial South Carolina ; but this author, 
by treating of one phase and doing it well, has 
made a real contribution to the literature on the 
subject. 

The hutory and Musical libraries have been enriched 
the meaning of in the last few years by the publica- 
noiatum in mutie. tion Q f a num ber of books designed 
to explain some of the complexer things that go to 
make up the technical structure of modern music, 
as well as some of the higher aesthetic problems 
connected with it. The representation of musical 
sounds in writing, called musical notation, — from 
nota, a mark or sign, — is a thing so commonplace, 
so universal, so apparently simple, that we are apt 
to overlook the fact that our stave, with its variously 
shaped " notes," and all that goes to convey a com- 
poser's thoughts to the world, are the outcome of 
centuries of experiments and gradual improvements. 
In " The Story of Notation " (imported by Charles 
Scribner's Sons), Mr. C F. Abdy Williams is shown 
to be a clear and sound thinker on musical subjects 
and an able expositor of the complications that 
enmesh many aspects of them. He points out that 
the roots of our modern musical system lie so deeply 
embedded in antiquity that it is impossible to trace 
the early history of its notation without reference 
to the Greek system from which it has sprung ; and 
this involves the use of certain words, found in 
ancient treatises, which are as unfamiliar to modern 
musicians and Greek scholars as the technicalities of 
modern musical structure are to the general public. 
Much information has been gathered by the author 
that has hitherto been difficult of access ; and con- 
siderable skill is shown in the condensation of the 
narrative, as well as the clearness with which facts 
not easily made plain to the modern point of view 
are here set forth. The book will appeal to musi- 
cians who have a curiosity to get behind the outer 
veil of sensuous sound upon the reasoned founda- 
tions that give to music its power of interpretation. 



PeriUtmd During the year 1902-3, four lec- 

preterraiion tures on Christian Sociology were de- 

of the home. li ve red by Mr. Jacob A. Biis before 

the Philadelphia Divinity School ; and these lectures 
are now published under the title of " The Peril 
and Preservation of the Home " (Jacobs). This 
will explain why the style of the book is rhetorical 
rather than literary, and why its substance is re- 
ligious rather than scientific. Upon the preserva- 
tion of the home, says Mr. Riis, depends the vitality 
of our republic. It is not necessary to prove it. he 
says, because " we know that it is so, that it has 
been so in all ages ; that the home-loving peoples 
have been the strong peoples in all time, those that 
have left a lasting impression upon the world." 
And our present poor citizenship is a product of 
the wretched environments in which the majority 
of men live, — their lack of a " home " in the best 
sense of the word. The causes of this state of 
affairs he finds in human selfishness as shown in 
various ways, especially in the tyranny of capital 
and labor, and the weakening of religious restraints. 
But " our sins of the past " have been partially 
counteracted by our recent awakening to the fact 
that there is a moral duty imposed upon us to 
rescue the slums, to provide better tenements as 
homes for our poor, to abolish child-labor, as a 
means of preserving these homes. The interest of 
the book lies largely in Mr. Riis's intimate know- 
ledge of the conditions which he describes, — his 
enthusiasm in the work to be accomplished com- 
pensating in some measure for the none too system- 
atic treatment of the subject. 

The borderland As Mr. Ely states in the preface to 
£feT&£tow. his " Studies in the Evolution of In- 
and sociology. dustrial Society" (Macmillan), the 
field traversed belongs to that general borderland 
where economics, ethics, biology, and sociology 
meet. Conscious of his limitations in time and 
space, he aims to be suggestive rather than ex- 
haustive ; to give his readers a general idea of the 
proportionate parts the various factors play in evo- 
lution of industrial society. With this end in view, 
he begins by surveying broadly the successive stages 
through which society has passed before it reaches 
the conditions favorable to an industrial economy. 
Although the line of development which he adopts 
has little that is new in the way of theory to add to 
the work of other economists, his treatment is ex- 
tremely careful and is fortified by statistical state- 
ments of supplementary and independent interest. 
Certain problems of industrial society suggested in 
this general survey are treated in separate chapters, 
where the author shows himself conversant not only 
with the opinions of a very large number of soci- 
ological and economic writers, but also with the 
actual conditions of to-day. He touches on the 
vital questions of competition, trusts, monopolies, 
municipal and national ownership, social progress, 
the concentration of wealth, public expenditures, 
and industrial adjustment in general. The book

contains some admirable chapters, — among them 
an analysis of the Steel Trust and a summary of the 
United States Industrial Commission's Report on 
Labor. Mr. Ely's style lacks conciseness, and for 
this reason his readers must exercise a little pa- 
tience in following his thought and argument. 

Admiral Porter, A vei 7 readable account of the naval

Commander. 8 ippi and Red rivers during the Civil 

War is contained in several chapters of the life of 
Admiral Porter, which Mr. James Russell Soley 
has written for the " Great Commanders " series 
(Appleton). The material is derived largely from 
the official records of the Naval War Office. As the 
author remarks, the work of Porter was not of the 
dashing or dramatic order likely to catch public 
attention, as was that of Farragut at New Orleans, 
Du Pont at Port Royal, or especially of Winslow on 
the " Kearsarge "; but it demanded even a higher 
degree of patience, attention to details, and a broader 
grasp of an extended situation to be dealt with. 
Porter's familiar penchant for rash speech, which 
frequently precipitated him into hot water with both 
the authorities and his friends, is attributed to an 
over-honesty of character and a rare straightfor- 
wardness. The author also admits a frequent in- 
consistency in Porter's views at different times. 
The volume, both in the abundance of historic matter 
presented and in giving facts instead of fulsome 
eulogy, is decidedly superior to many of the biogra- 
phies appearing in the various " series " at this time. 



A bicentennial 
life of Wesley. 



The history 
of famous 
assassinations, 



Many are the threads on which have 
been strung the beads of historical 
incidents of note, that they might at- 
tract the attention of the general reader ; but sel- 
dom has there been a stranger thread than that used 
by Mr. Francis Johnson in his " Thirty Famous As- 
sassinations " (A. C. McClurg & Co.). In this book 
are described assassinations that have grown out 
of the general conditions of the various periods of 
western history, from that of Philip of Macedon, 
in 336 B.C., to that of King Alexander and Queen 
Draga in the present year. The author has selected 
those " which either had an important and political 
bearing on the world, or on the nation immediately 
affected, or which left a profound impression on the 
imagination of contemporaries and posterity." The 
American subjects are Presidents Lincoln and Mc- 
Kinley ; the assassination of President Garfield is 
omitted as growing out of the aberration of a single 
diseased mind, and having no marked political 
significance. When there have been several note- 
worthy assassinations growing out of one general 
condition, a typical example has been selected. The 
stories are well told and the book is a compact 
presentation of some of the most interesting and 
dramatic chapters in political history. A number 
of interesting portraits of the men and women dealt 
with adds to the attractiveness of the volume, which 
is unusually presentable in outward form. 



The Rev. William Henry Meredith 
does well to base his account of 
"The Real John Wesley" (Jen- 
nings & Pye) on the Journal of that ever- interest- 
ing man. But perhaps we should have entered 
upon our reading of this attractive volume with 
keener zest, had not the author proclaimed it in his 
preface as " giving a unique portraiture" of its sub- 
ject. Moreover, the Methodist minister is through- 
out a little too obvious in the narrator. Wesley's 
is a life that can best be left to point its own moral. 
The chapter on his wit and humor hardly succeeds 
in proving him a humorist. Wit he had in good 
measure, for he was surprisingly alert in mind no 
less than in body. Meeting in a narrow lane a 
purse-proud squire who rudely declared that he 
never turned out for a fool, Wesley at once replied, 
" I always do," and turned aside to let the other 
pass. A sense of humor would have saved Wesley 
from the childish credulity and absurd superstition 
that here and there crop out in his Journal. Mr. 
Meredith's book will give special satisfaction to 
those of his own communion, though it fails to 
make the great Methodist any more real to the 
reader than do other accounts written with that ob- 
ject less obviously in view. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Professor Clement Huart, of the Ecole des Langues 
Orientales, has prepared " A History of Arabic Litera- 
ture " (Appleton) for the series of " Literatures of the 
World," now numbering an even dozen of volumes. 
The scope of this work is wide, since it includes all 
literature in the Arabic language, and extends from the 
pre-lslamic poets of the desert all the way down to the 
journalism of to-day. A work so packed with un- 
familiar names and titles can hardly be said to make 
interesting reading for anyone but a specialist, but 
there can be no doubt of its scholarly character, or of 
the desirability for reference purposes of such a com- 
pendium of a literature that has played a great part in 
the world's thought. 

The appearance of the seventh and concluding vol- 
ume in the " definitive edition de luxe " of Edward 
FitzGerald's works, published by the Macmillan Co., 
leads us to add a final word of praise to what we have 
already said regarding this edition. Here, for the first 
time, the incomparable Letters are brought together and 
arranged in correct chronological order, with an Index 
making their wealth of allusion readily available for 
reference. This fact, together with the handsome out- 
ward appearance of the set, makes it by far the best 
edition of FitzGerald that we now have, or are likely 
to have in the future. 

" Masters of English Landscape Painting " is the sub- 
ject of the latest special number of " The International 
Studio " (John Lane). J. S. Cotman, David Cox, and 
Peter De Wint are the three masters considered, and 
they are dealt with, respectively, by Messrs. Laurence 
Binyon, A. L. Baldry, and Walter Shaw Sparrow. Pro- 
fuse illustrations, a great many in color, are a special 
feature of the work.

Notes. 

A pretty edition of FitzGerald's ■ Polonius," attract- 
ively printed in black and red and bound in full limp 
leather, is issued by the Scott-Thaw Co. as the first 
volume of their " Wisdom Series." 

A small first edition of " My Own Story " by Mr. 
J. T. Trowbridge has been issued in uncut style, bound 
in boards with paper label, each copy being signed by 
the author. It is being rapidly taken up by collectors 
and book-lovers. 

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the American pub- 
lishers of a new edition, in two volumes, of " The Auto- 
biography of Leigh Hunt." Mr. Roger Ingpen has 
acted as editor, and several photogravure portraits are 
provided for illustrations. 

A series of drawings to illustrate Stevenson's " Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde " has been made by an American 
artist, Mr. Charles Raymond Macauley, and will be 
included in a new edition of that work to be published 
this Fall by the Scott-Thaw Co. 

Five new volumes in the new Dent-Macmillan Thack- 
eray give us "Catherine," "Sketches and Travels in 
London," the "Christmas Books," the "Roundabout 
Papers," and " Denis Duval " united under the same 
covers with " Lovel the Widower." 

A new series of standard reprints will be published 
this Fall by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co., to be called 
the " Handy Volume Cambridge Classics." There will 
be eleven carefully selected books in this series, printed 
on clear white wove paper, and attractively bound. 

An edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's " An Inland 
Voyage " is published by Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & 
Co., uniform with their other Stevenson reprints. The 
volume is uncommonly well-made in every detail, and 
illustrated with an interesting portrait and two small 
sketches in photogravure. 

Mr. Montague Howard is the author of an authorita- 
tive work, " Old London Silver, its History, its Marks 
and its Makers," which the Scribners will publish this 
Fall in an elaborate and handsome volume. It has 
been years in preparation, and will no doubt be recog- 
nized at once as the authority in its field. 

" Songs from the Hearts of Women," compiled by 
Mr. Nicholas Smith, is a recent publication of Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. It consists of one hundred re- 
ligious lyrics and hymns by women writers, each of 
them being accompanied by a brief commentary of a 
combined biographical and critical character. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. are publishing the 
second volume in Professor Liddell's large " Eliza- 
bethan Shakspere," containing "The Tempest"; and 
they are also issuing the first volume in a low-priced 
library edition for those who do not care to purchase 
the regular edition in its very expensive form. 

" The Poet Gray as a Naturalist," being selections 
from the notes of Gray in his copy of the " Systema 
Naturae " of Linnaeus, will be published this month by 
Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed of Boston. The volume will 
contain facsimiles of some of the pages, together with 
an introduction by Prof. Charles Eliot Norton. 

Messrs. Harper & Brothers are bringing out an extra- 
illustrated edition of President Woodrow Wilson's " A 
History of the American People." To the already unu- 
sually large number of illustrations in this work the pub- 
lishers have added twenty-five photogravure portraits 
of the Presidents, from Washington to Roosevelt. 



The inexpensive and readable " Fireside " Dickens 
published by Mr. Henry Frowde is now complete. The 
new volumes are " The Uncommercial Traveller," the 
"Christmas Stories," "Our Mutual Friend," filling 
nearly a thousand pages, and, in a single volume, 
"Master Humphrey's Clock" and "Edwin Drood." 

Both in England and America the first edition of 
Morley's Life of Gladstone was sold out on publication, 
owing to the unexpectedly large demand for the book. 
So eagerly has the British public taken up the work 
that there is talk of its issue in parts, as novels used to 
be published in the days of Thackeray and Dickens. 

The first volume in " Margaret Sidney's " famous 
" Pepper " series, entitled " Five Little Peppers and 
How They Grew," has taken a new lease of life in the 
illustrated edition just issued by the Lothrop Co., who 
state that the book is more popular now than at any 
time during the more than twenty years that it has 
been on the market. 

Ruskin's biographer and friend, Mr. W. G. Colling- 
wood, has written a supplementary volume of remin- 
iscences which he calls " Ruskin Relics." It presents 
some drawings by Ruskin and chatty anecdotes, and 
other interesting material concerning him. The book 
is announced for publication in the early Spring by 
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. 

Mr. James Schouler's " Eighty Years of Union ■ 
(Dodd) is a short history of the United States from 
1783 to 1865, condensed for school uses from the well- 
known large work by the same author. The conden- 
sation is not by abstraction, but by the selection of 
lengthy complete passages, on the plan similarly ap- 
plied not long ago to the works of Francis Parkman. 

" Samuel Brohl and Company," by Victor Cherbuliez, 
is published by the Ormeril Co., Cincinnati, in their 
" Collection of Foreign Authors," which leads us to ask 
the question why some publisher does not have the 
good sense to give us a complete Cherbuliez — the 
whole twenty or more volumes — in English, and thus 
earn the gratitude (as well as the dollars) of hosts of 
readers. 

"The Dance of Life," by the author of "Doctor 
Syntax," and Goldsmith's "The Vicar of Wakefield," 
both with the original colored illustrations by Row- 
landson, are the latest additions to the series of reprints 
published by the Messrs. Appleton, of which we have 
already made mention. We should be grateful to the 
publishers if they would provide the series with a col- 
lective title. 

The A. Wessels Company has secured the American 
edition of " Stevensoniana " by Mr. J. A. Hammerton, 
which will be published by them immediately. The edi- 
tion is limited to 1000 copies for England and America, 
and is issued uniform with the Edinburgh edition of 
Stevenson. The single aim before the compiler was to 
search for his material only in the forgotten pages of 
English and American periodicals, and in books by 
writers of eminence not entirely devoted to Stevenson. 

The " Mermaid Series " of old English dramatists 
was one of the most nsef ul collections of reprints ever 
undertaken. The volumes were well-edited, and pro- 
vided trustworthy reproductions of the original plays. 
When the publication slackened, and, after the appear- 
ance of about a score of volumes, ceased altogether, it 
was to us a matter of deep regret. We now welcome 
a new edition of this series, reduced in size of volume 
and made more attractive than the earlier issue in many

ways. What is still better news is that several new 
volumes are to be added to the series. The Messrs. 
Scribner import the set, of which Marlowe, Steele, 
Congreve, and the three volumes of Jonson are now at 
hand. 

The first of the volumes upon the life and work of 
the late James A. McNeill Whistler which may be 
expected to appear during the next year or go, is an- 
nounced for immediate publication by J. B. Lippincott 
Company. The author is Mr. Arthur Jerome Eddy, 
who for a number of years enjoyed the friendship of 
the distinguished American painter, wit, and critic, and 
was a close observer of his character and habits. The 
volume will bear the title, " Recollections and Impres- 
sions of James A. McNeill Whistler." 

J. B. Lippincott Company announce that they will 
shortly publish in this country, in cooperation with 
Messrs. Duckworth & Company in England, "A History 
of Theatrical Art in Ancient and Modern Times," by 
the distinguished Copenhagen actor, Karl Mantzius, 
translated by L. Von Cossel, with an introduction by 
Mr. William Archer. The first two volumes, which are 
almost ready, deal with the earliest times, the Middle 
Ages, and the Renaissance. The third volume treats of 
the English drama in Shakespeare's time. 

Messrs. T. Y Crowell & Co. publish a neat series of 
" Handy Volume Classics " in a " pocket edition " of 
which the following six numbers have just been re- 
ceived: "Frondes Agrestes," by John Ruskin; "The 
Conduct of Life," by Emerson; " Past and Present," by 
Carlyle; a selection from Cotton's Montaigne; Frank- 
lin's autobiography, edited by Mr. N. H. Dole; and a 
volume called "Elizabethan Dramatists," edited by 
Mr. G. A. Watrous, and containing " Dr. Faustus," 
" Every Man in his Humour," and " Philaster."

THE STORY OF A BOOK. 



IN THREK CHAPTERS. 



♦Chapter 3. A Triple Verdict. 
"/^ ET'the best" — this to the public; "make 
>-r the best" — this to themselves, has been 
the motto of the publishers of Webster's Inter- 
national Dictionary. Their aim has been to 
make the best popular dictionary in the En- 
glish language, in respect to accuracy, clear- 
ness, fullness, convenience, and usefulness to 
all classes of consulters. Comparison is not 
here made with the many-volumed and ency- 
clopedic works, but with those whose size and 
form adapt them to quick and easy use ; the 
one-volume books which aim to serve all classes 
from the erudite scholar to the school-child. 

Without a word of disparaging comment on 
other works which claim to rival Webster, let 
us seek the verdict of some tribunal so high 
in character and intelligence, so numerous in 
membership, and so impartial in constitution, 
as to give a sanction like that of a court of last 
resort. Three such tribunals will be cited as 
to the merits of Webster's International Dic- 
tionary, in comparison with all works of simi- 
lar aim. 

To what authority upon doubtful questions 
do the American people habitually pay the 
highest deference? Unquestionably, to the Na- 
tional and State Supreme Courts. They are not 
only accepted as final arbiters on the vast and 
vital matters within their immediate sphere, 
but in great emergencies, like a disputed presi- 
dency or a wide-spread labor disturbance, the 
national impulse turns to these courts as the 
strongholds of broad intelligence and the high- 
est fairness. Weighty then are their opinions 
on a subject so peculiarly within their range 
as text-books of definitions. Language, the 
medium through which all statutes and prece- 
dents are expressed, is the very subject matter 
with which courts are continually dealing. It 
is of the first consequence to them to have 
some standard of appeal as to the meanings 
and usages of words, which is not only of the 
first order of intrinsic merit, but is so widely 
recognized as to command popular approval. 
Hear then the opinions, first of individuals and 
then virtually of the entire body, of the highest 
judiciary of the country. 

In the United States Supreme Court, Chief 
Justice Fuller says of the International : " I 

♦Chapters 1 and 2 of " The Story of a Book " appeared in 
the two previous issues of The Dial. 



regard it as of the utmost value in accuracy 
of definition, and have found it in all respects 
complete and thorough." Justice Gray : " I 
always considered Webster's Dictionary as the 
best in the language in the matter of defini- 
tions." Justice Brewer : " From my child- 
hood up, Webster's Dictionary has been my 
authority. The last, the International Dic- 
tionary, is the perfection of dictionaries." Jus- 
tice Brown, after a life-long experience, has 
found it " invaluable as a book of easy refer- 
ence," and believes " it will succeed for many 
years in maintaining its position as the lead- 
ing dictionary of the language." Justice 
Shiras is no less emphatic. Justice Harlan 
says : " It should be in the library of every 
American judge, lawyer, preacher, journalist, 
statesman, and student"; and while it is desir- 
able to have more than one dictionary always 
at hand, " if only one can be afforded, prefer- 
ence should be given to Webster's Interna- 
tional Dictionary." Justice McKenna has 
" always used the Webster " and finds its old 
reputation as to completeness and accuracy 
sustained by the International. Justice White 
in "daily use" finds the book "of the great- 
est utility "; and Justice Peckham, praising 
especially the Supplement of 1900, regards 
the whole work as constituting " a perfect ex- 
position of the English language as existing at 
this time." 

Turning now to the highest courts of all the 
States, we find an almost unanimous consen- 
sus to the same effect. Thus Chief Justice 
Knowlton of the Massachusetts Supreme Court 
says : " For all who want but one dictionary 
of the English language for general use in any 
department of study, or in literary or profes- 
sional work, I regard Webster's International 
as decidedly the best." And so on through 
the State Courts, the entire body of judges 
generally speaking as one. In many instances 
the statement is explicit that the Interna- 
tional is preferred before all others. The most 
guarded expression is that of the Justices of 
the New York Court of Appeals, and they 
speak of the International as " in no respect 
falling behind its numerous rivals, however re- 
markable for their extent and accuracy." The 
opinions of the entire bench of other State Su- 
preme Courts may be briefly sampled. Penn- 
sylvania: "No other single volume is so 
valuable or so satisfactory." New Hampshire: 
"The best one-book dictionary of the English 
language." Arkansas, California, Oregon, and 
Wisconsin say the same. Kentucky calls it " the

most comprehensive and accurate dictionary in 
existence." Nevada says : " In our library we 
have many other dictionaries, but all of them 
put together are not consulted as much as 
Webster." New Jersey : " For everyday use, 
no English lexicon is at all comparable with 
Webster's International." Equally emphatic 
are Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Min- 
nesota, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Tennessee, 
Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. All 
these are explicit in affirming the International 
as the best for general use ; and this is since 
the publication of all its would-be rivals. The 
Florida Justices define its peculiar service to 
the bench : " Frequently the proper interpre- 
tation of an instrument or a statute, before us 
for review, hinges upon the accurate definition 
of a word : in all such cases we turn with con- 
fidence to Webster's International." Others 
dwell upon the fund of general information ; 
thus the North Dakota Justices : " No other 
single book extant contains such stores of rich, 
varied, and exact knowledge." The Ohio Su- 
preme Court : " The new (1900) edition of 
Webster's International seems to have reached 
the acme of perfection in book-making, edi- 
torially and mechanically." In brief, the en- 
tire body of Judges in the National and State 
Supreme Courts, with the exception of hardly 
a dozen individuals (and these recommended 
no other), have borne testimony to the pre- 
eminent merit of the International. 

To the question, " What popular dictionary 
is accepted as of the highest authority and 
value by the people of the United States," — 
could there be any more weighty answer than 
this almost unanimous testimony of the Su- 
preme Court Judges of the Nation and all the 
States? 

Another tribunal may be cited, which in a 
different field carries not less authority, and 
which speaks with one voice. The public school 
systems of the forty-five States are practically 
a unit in favor of the International. Every 
one of their State Superintendents recom- 
mends it in the highest terms. In every State 
Normal school it is the accepted standard. 
Wherever State funds have been appropriated 
for the purchase of a large dictionary for the 
schools, Webster's has been the book. The 
school books of the country, wherever they are 
of such character as to require a standard in 
spelling, pronunciation, and definition, follow 
the International with hardly an exception. 

The highest judiciary and the entire public 
school svstem — better indexes of American 



opinion can hardly be named. It remains to 
question that broader constituency which the 
name " International " suggests, — the English- 
speaking peoples beyond America. It has been 
said that the judgment of foreigners carries a 
weight like that of posterity, — owing to its 
freedom from local or temporary bias. Taking 
first Great Britain : the popular test shows a 
sale of the International far beyond that of any 
other one- volume dictionary, English or Amer- 
ican. The official test is given by the fact that 
the only Governmental departments of Great 
Britain using any standard of language — the 
Postal and Telegraphic, both managed entirely 
by the Government — follow the International. 
The scholar's test may .be best indicated, to 
take from many tributes the most authoritative 
and impressive, by the unsolicited words of Dr. 
Murray, editor of the unfinished many-volumed 
Oxford Dictionary, and probably the highest 
individual authority on lexicography in the 
English-speaking world : " In this its latest 
form, and with its large Supplement and nu- 
merous Appendices, Webster's International 
Dictionary is a wonderful volume, which well 
maintains its grounds against all rivals, on its 
own lines." And again : " The last edition of 
Webster, the International, is perhaps the best 
of one- volume dictionaries." 

In Canada, the International far outsells all 
rivals. In Australia it has the field to itself, 
and with special reason; for this great com- 
monwealth has been explored with the utmost 
thoroughness as to its wealth of new words 
and usages, by representatives of Webster on 
the ground, cooperating with the best local 
scholarship, and reaping a harvest which the 
home office has winnowed and inwrought with 
the main work. In the new American Col- 
onies, in South Africa, in India, in China, in 
Japan, throughout Continental Europe, and 
wherever flies the Stars and Stripes or the 
Union Jack, the International goes as a chief 
symbol and agent of that language which leads 
the world's civilization. 

" The story of a book " — it has been shown 
as a story of supreme concentration ; Noah 
Webster devoting a lifetime of genius, learn- 
ing, and character to one book ; the G. & C. 
Merriam Company giving their whole energy 
for sixty years to perfecting and spreading the 
work. It has been a story of the close alliance 
of Scholarship and Business ; the scholar's 
thirst for perfection wedded to the business 
man's sense of practical needs. It is a story 
of growth, the patriot scholar's lonely dream

THE DIAL 



I Nov. 1, 



of an " American Dictionary of the English 
Language," maturing to an " International 
Dictionary," the accepted authority of a world- 
encompassing race. 

The blue-backed Webster's Speller, of which 
the public have consumed some seventy-five 
million copies, concluded with a few pungent 
fables, "The Milkmaid," "The Old Man's 
Apple Tree and the Rude Boy," etc., and to 
each fable was appended a moral. To the 
present Story the Moral may be given in words 
a little amplified from an old quotation : All 
young persons, and all older ones no less, 
should have a dictionary at their elbow ; and 
while you are about it, get the best — get Web- 
ster's International.

BOOK publishers and book journals are 
alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous journals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom are bookish people. All 
the readers of a book journal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the interests 
of the book class, — the literary and culti- 
vated class. 



THE DIAL is more generally consulted 
and depended upon by librarians in 
making up orders for books than any 
other American critical journal ; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other journal of its class; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country.

Senator GEORGE F. HOAR'S new book 

Autobiography of 
Seventy Years 

In Two Volumes, Large 8vo, with Portrait, $7.50 net 

NOT only for its political importance, but for the unusual personal, social, and literary interest of 
the reminiscences it brings together, Senator Hoar's autobiography will be the most notable 
contribution of the year to memoir-literature. It would be impossible to find another man in the 
country who has known more of the important men and measures of his time than Mr. Hoar ; and 
the charm and piquancy of his style, with its range, from the eloquent discussion of his political 
principles to the humor of his anecdotes, are as remarkable as his experiences. The book is re- 
freshingly frank and full of character and individuality — a record of opinions as well as events.

Reminiscences of the Civil War 

By GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON 

Here is a sample review from the New York Evening Sun: 

THE tone of the book is genial, magnanimous and tolerant ; the style unaffected, luminous and 
often eloquent. One thinks of John B. Gordon as a virile and lovable character. It was a 
fine thing for a man to bear himself so worthily in the great war : it was finer to write about it so 
sweetly and fairly in the decline of life — ' nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.' 
Every American should read General Gordon's book. He will be a better citizen for it, and it 
will be a tonic to his patriotism."

Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of 
London. The Swedish Government is making 
his atlas at its own expense. 

This book is the first adequate description of 
his remarkable expedition and its accomplish-

well as solid achievement, that he has been 
called, by the London press, " the modern 
knight-errant of science."

THE ODOR MOMMSEN. 



The Germans have made the history of 
Rome and the study of its antiquities pecu- 
liarly their own, and the students of other na- 
tions have sat at their feet for a century past. 
The long line of investigators from Niebuhr 
to Mommsen constitutes one of the greatest 
glories of German scholarship, and the last of 
the line, who died on the first day of the pres- 
ent month, was the greatest scholar of them 
all. Theodor Mommsen, preeminent among the 
" grand old men " left to the twentieth century 
as a legacy from the nineteenth, was born in 
Schleswig on the last day of November, 1817, 
and had nearly completed his eighty-sixth year 
at the time of his death. His life was one of 
uninterrupted labor in his chosen field, and his 
prodigious achievement has set a mark which 
will not easily be approached by any scholar 
of the coming time. 

Mommsen's preliminary studies, in philol- 
ogy, jurisprudence, and archaeology, were made 
at the University of Kiel, and during a tour of 
three years in France and Italy, spent in col- 
lecting Roman inscriptions. In 1848, he be- 
gan his professional career, occupying chairs 
in Leipzig, Zurich, and Breslau, before settling 
down, ten years later, in the city which was to 
become the capital of the German Empire, and 
which thus became his home for the forty-five 
years remaining to him. Here he entered upon 
the great work of his life, the publication of the 
" Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum," of which 
the first part appeared in 1863, and which fills 
many volumes, collecting and preserving all 
extant Latin inscriptions down to the time of 
Caesar. Other works of great importance are 
his handbook of Roman antiquities, his editions 
of the Digest and the Corpus Juris Civilis, and 
his " Rbmische Forschungen," to say nothing 
of his countless papers on coins, dialects, epi- 
graphy, and jurisprudence. 

Overshadowing all these productions in the 
estimation of the general public, the five vol- 
umes of his Roman history, with the two sup- 
plementary volumes on the provinces of the 
Empire, constitute his chief claim to the re- 
gard of cultivated readers who are not special- 
ists. It is by this work alone that he is widely

[Nov. 16, 



read throughout the world, and through its 
agency that his name has been a household 
word during the last half-century wherever 
books are read. It is a work of strong preju- 
dices, no doubt, and its deification of mere 
strength, as typified by Julius Caesar, some- 
what discredits it with those who lay stress 
upon moral distinctions. It is also open to 
the criticism of the late C. K. Adams, who 
pointed out that neither philology nor the 
study of inscriptions may be regarded as a 
perfectly secure foundation for history. But 
whatever its defects from an ideal standpoint, 
there is no denying its brilliancy of style, its 
incisiveness of characterization, and the im- 
petuous energy with which it rushes onward. 
Its theories stand by no means unopposed, but 
it is the work of a great advocate, and the first 
impression it produces is simply overwhelming. 

A man who has served learning as well as 
Mommsen has might well be forgiven had he 
done nothing more than this. But the ideal of 
cloistered scholarship did not satisfy his own 
sense of obligation to his fellows, and for many 
years he has been conspicuous among the 
scholars who are also men of affairs. His en- 
trance into public life in the strict sense was 
made late in his career, but from the early sev- 
enties down to the time of his death he was a 
force to be reckoned with in practical politics. 
He was always the outspoken champion of 
liberalism, and he even locked horns with Bis- 
marck in one memorable instance, being pros- 
ecuted for his alleged libellous utterances, and 
triumphantly acquitted in both the ensuing 
trials. Unlike most German liberalists, he did 
not ally himself with the Socialist movement, 
but opposed it with all his might as a menace 
to individualism, which he believed to be a 
necessary condition of progress. He was the 
champion of the Jew when attacked by the 
anti-Semitic fury, and of academic freedom 
when threatened by administrative intolerance. 
During very recent years his voice was raised 
in sharp condemnation of the American folly 
which led to our needless war with Spain and 
our wanton piracy in the Philippine Islands. 
He was also outspoken in his censure of the 
English policy which resulted in the South 
African war. 

Yet in spite of this censure, to which con- 
science constrained him, of the recent acts of 
England and America in the international 
arena, he was at heart the friend of the 
English-speaking peoples, because he knew 
that they had been historically, and in spite I 



of temporary aberrations, the defenders of lib- 
erty, and the trustees of the hope of democracy. 
And almost the last of his published words, 
written for the pages of an English review, 
expressed his confidence in the race which he 
had so recently criticised in such caustic terms. 
" I know," he said, 

" That I speak not only for myself, but for the best, 
and, at the same time, for the great majority of the 
German people, when I say that, though we have no 
doubt disapproved, and shall continue to disapprove, a 
single act of the English nation, we yet feel ourselves 
more nearly akin, and in every respect more intimately 
allied, to them than to any other nation. The English 
language is, after all, in its main elements Saxon ; and 
Shakespeare has been for Germany as well as for En- 
gland a spiritual deliverer, and the father of our poetry. 
... I look back over a long life : of what I hoped for 
my own nation and for the world at large, only a small 
part has been fulfilled. But the holy alliance of the 
nations was the aim of my youth, and is still the star 
of my old age." 

With these noble words still echoing in our 
consciousness, we now take leave of the man 
who uttered them, and know full well that the 
world is indescribably the poorer for his death. 



SCIENCE IN T HE EN CYCLOPEDIAS. 

" Accuracy is very properly regarded as the most essential 
of all the attributes of [an Encyclopaedia] ." — Editorial in 
the New International Encyclopaedia, 1902. 

" Let the owner of a book find within its covers erroneous, 
misleading, or even prejudiced or partisan statements, and 
he distrusts it ever afterward." — Editorial in the Encyclo- 
pedia Americana. 

The older editions of "Chambers's Encyclopaedia" 
contain an article on Slugs which is not altogether 
accurate. In the one before me — that of 1876 — 
I find these words : 

" The Red S. (Agrion agrestis) is also very plentiful." 
Now the red slug is not Agrion agrestis, but is 
Arion ater var. rufus, sometimes called Arion 
empiricorum. Agrion is the name of a genus of 
dragon-flies, while agrestis is the specific name of 
the field slug (Agriolimax agrestis). If the doc- 
trine of the survival of the fittest is worth anything 
in literature, it would seem that this curious hybrid 
animal, a mixture of two sorts of slugs and a dragon- 
fly, should have quickly become extinct. But not so. 
Innocent of all sense of the ridiculous, the creature 
flaunts itself through the years, and meets us at 
every turn. 

" The Red S. (Agrion agrestis) is also very plentiful." — 
Library of Universal Knowledge, 1880. 

" The Red Slug {agrion agrestis) is also very plentiful." 

— Library of Universal Knowledge, new edition, 1882. 
"A. agrestis, the Red Slug." — Encyclopaedic Dictionary, 

1896. 

" The Red Slug (agrion agrestis) is also very plentiful." 

— International Cyclopaedia, 1900.

dred works prevents me from following its slimy- 
trail any farther, but it is only fair to mention that 
" Chambers " has long ago disavowed the animal. 

" Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia," 1897, figures 
the red slug, but wisely refrains from offering a 
scientific name. The figure represents the genuine 
beast (Arion) and the only criticism one can offer is 
that it is not found in America- The " American 
Cyclopaedia," 1881, gives a figure of a slug, labeled 
Limax (i. e. Agriolimax) agrestis; but unfortu- 
nately the picture is that of a totally different Eu- 
ropean species, Amalia sowerbii. In the text are 
some remarks on "the common slug of New En- 
gland, L. tunicata, Gould," the writer being evi- 
dently unaware that this name is a synonym of 
Agriolimax agrestis. Even the " Century Diction- 
ary," usually a model of accuracy, cannot with im- 
punity handle the dangerous subject of Slugs. It 
tells us about the Teneriffe Slug, " which shines at 
night like the glow-worm," an apparently fabulous 
creature unknown to modern naturalists ; and Alaska 
is given — surely in error — as a locality for Ario- 
limax Columbianus. The "New International" 
and the u Encyclopaedia Americana " have not yet 
reached the letter S, so we cannot tell what sur- 
prises they may have in store for us. 

The above criticism is a little technical, no doubt ; 
but it is written for the average reader. One of the 
first signs of prosperity in an American household 
is the purchase of an encyclopaedia. The owner 
feels that he has acquired a new brain, at a very 
moderate cost, considering its utility. It would be 
hard to overestimate the educational value of a good 
encyclopaedia well used. The writer of these lines 
was brought up on " Chambers," and to-day he can- 
not look upon the familiar volumes without a f eeling 
akin to reverence. It is with the strongest possible 
sense of the importance of encyclopaedias, and of the 
good work they have done and are doing, that these 
remarks are offered. Because of this feeling, and 
because of the trust that is everywhere placed in 
these works, it becomes necessary to insist that they 
should be in all respects worthy of their mission. 
Their editors would be the last to deny this, but 
where the spirit has been willing, the flesh has been 
all too weak. 

Some time ago, in the town of Las Vegas, New 
Mexico, I was visited by a lady and gentleman who 
were acting as travelling agents for the New Inter- 
national Encyclopaedia. I expressed surprise that 
these well-educated and competent people could 
make any sort of a living out of the sales of a single 
encyclopaedia in a comparatively thinly peopled 
region. They assured me, however, that the work 
paid. Although I was not a purchaser, they kindly 
loaned me the first volume (the only one then out), 
and I examined it with very great interest. The ful- 
ness of detail, the number of subjects treated, and 
the excellence of many of the illustrations, were 
indeed remarkable. But alas ! here and there were 
the queerest things. In an article on "The Arctic 
Region " a figure of an arctic plant was upside down. 



Under "Ant Lion " was a figure of a quite different 
insect, the lace-wing fly or Chrysopa. Under " An- 
thocyan" the facts about the well-known chemical 
reaction were exactly reversed. These and a few 
other errors were pointed out to the publishers (who 
had very likely heard of them from other quarters ! ), 
and in the more recently printed copies they have 
been corrected. Thus, I find that while the copy at 
Colorado College contains them, that at the Colorado 
Springs public library is correct. It must have been 
very troublesome to make the changes after the 
printing was far advanced, and the fact that they 
were made illustrates the genuineness of the editors' 
desire for accuracy. 

However, there are other things in later volumes. 
One or two may be cited: 

ARTICLE "LAC." ARTICLE " LAC-mSECT." 
" The general name under " Any one of the several 
which the various products of scale-insects of the coccid 
the lac-insect (Coccus lacca) genus Carteria, which se- 
are known. The insects live cretes lac ( q. v.) Carteria 
upon the twigs of certain lacca, of Asia, secretes the 
trees, and soon entomb them- gum lac or stick lac of corn- 
selves in a mass of matter, merce." [Only three species 
which oozes from small of lac-insects are indicated as 
punctures made in the twigs known ; the known species 
of the tree, and which thus actually number 24.] 
furnishes them with both 
food and shelter." 

In one of these articles we are told that the insect 
secretes the lac, in the other that it oozes from the 
tree. The lac is actually secreted by the insect. 
The names given for the lac insect are different in 
the two articles ; one of them was current a hundred 
years ago, the other twenty-five years ago and later, 
while modern entomologists call the creature Tach- 
ardia lacca. 

In the article "Coccidae" we read: "For the 
latest systematic account of the family by Cockerell 
consult ' Four New Diaspine Coccidae,' besides other 
articles in the Canadian Entomologist. ' ' The article 
cited is one of the least important of those by the 
writer mentioned, and nothing whatever is said about 
the beautiful and indispensable works of Signoret, 
Green, and Newstead. 

In the article "Mantis" the figure is labelled 
Mantis Carolina, while the text has Stagamomantis 
[misprint for Stagmomantis] Carolina, the latter 
being correct except for the misprint- The Euro- 
pean mantis is called Mantio [misprint for Mantis] 
religiosa. 

The "Encyclopedia Americana," also in course 
of publication, suffers from the same general malady. 
There are good signed articles by Packard, Coville, 
etc., but they cover only part of the scientific field. 
A rather hasty examination reveals a few things 
like these: 

Butterflies. — The second plate has most of the 
names misplaced. 

Cabbage insects. — The harlequin cabbage-bug is 
called a beetle, and Plusia brassicai is apparently 
intended by the name Noctua brassicai. 

California. — The California mountain sheep is 
wrongly called Ovis ammon.

[Nov. 16, 



Arizona. — We are told that "Arizona is a tropic 
country modified by its elevation in the north; . . . 
there are no true summer and winter, but a short 
rainy season in midsummer and a dry one the rest 
of the year." 

What is the remedy for this unfortunate condi- 
tion of affairs? It cannot be denied that the editors 
of the encyclopaedias are good men, and that the pub- 
lishers have done bravely. Moreover, the writings 
of the most competent living authorities, on their 
own chosen subjects, are by no means free from 
error. Nevertheless, there are ample opportunities 
for improvement. Those who have done any writing 
for encyclopaedias know how trifling is the pay of- 
fered, and how the work is farmed out to almost 
anyone who is reasonably competent. Compare this 
with the enormous sums expended in putting the 
books upon the market, — in agents and advertise- 
ments, — and it seems sufficiently evident that things 
are not properly balanced. The expenses involved 
in publication are necessarily high, but at present 
they must be out of all proportion to the cost of get- 
ting the material. I do not mean by this that the 
writing and editing may not cost more than the 
advertising, — whether they do or not I have no 
knowledge, — but I do mean that the time and ex- 
pense given to the preparation of the text is usually 
quite inadequate. Considering the great importance 
of the encyclopaedias to the people of this country, 
it would seem as if they could not be too carefully 
prepared, and that the very best authorities should 
in every case be consulted. Those who, having 
knowledge of special matters, refuse to place it at 
the service of the encyclopaedias are surely blame- 
worthy, always assuming that they are not required 
to work for an unreasonably small wage. One dif- 
ficulty, no doubt, arises from the number of parallel 
publications, resulting in competition, which does not 
seem to encourage anything but activity in adver- 
tising. It might be supposed that the competing 
works would be stirred up to excel in all good qual- 
ities; but I believe that the contrary effect is pro- 
duced, because of the necessity for economy and the 
attempts to catch the public eye by other than schol- 
arly means. To illustrate my meaning, I will ask 
the explanation of several of the full-page portraits 
in the "Encyclopedia Americana." They are cer- 
tainly not there because the fitness of things de- 
mands it. Another source of trouble arises I think 
from the anonymity of the articles. The editors of 
the "New International" set forth a plea for an- 
onymity ; but the fact remains that signed articles 
are at least on the average more carefully prepared, 
and as for the revision spoken of as necessary, the 
authors themselves should revise as frequently as 
occasion demands. To an intelligent reader, also, 
the knowledge of the author's name is of material 
assistance in estimating the character and value of 
what is read. It has been well said that no litera- 
ture can be quite perfectly understood without a 
certain knowledge of the personal equation of the 
writer. 



Would it not be possible for American scholars 
to follow somewhat the plan of the great Oxford 
Dictionary, and cooperate toward the production of 
a really national encyclopaedia, which should reflect 
the very best knowledge and scholarship in the 
land? Probably one of the existing works could 
be taken as the foundation. I do not suggest an 
international encyclopaedia, because I believe we 
require one which meets our special conditions and 
needs, and at any rate that is a sufficient under- 
taking for the present. t. D. A. Cockerell. 



COMMUNICA TION. 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S JUDGMENT OF EMERSON. 
( To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In a notice of Sir M. E. G. Duff's new book, " Out 
of the Past," printed on page 314 of your issue of 
November 1, I find an incidental reference to Matthew 
Arnold's " rating Emerson's Essays as the most impor- 
tant prose work done in English in this century." 

The words quoted make one rub his eyes. Recalling 
how Arnold was berated in this country for his supposed 
disparagement of Emerson, and recalling also that the 
century in which Emerson's prose work is thus made 
of paramount importance includes such writers as 
Carlyle, Ruskin, Spencer, Tyndall, Huxley, Newman, 
and other great names which will readily occur, the 
judgment of Arnold as cited by you certainly seems 
amazing, if not incredible. Q # j\ jj # 

Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 5, 1903. 

[The citation is nevertheless correct. Arnold's 
exact words are: "As Wordsworth's poetry is, in 
my judgment, the most important work done in 
verse, in our language, during the present century, 
so Emerson's Essays are, I think, the most impor- 
tant work done in prose." The words may be found 
in Arnold's " Discourses in America," at page 196 
of the English edition. — Edr.] 



The Arthur H. Clark Company, Cleveland, announce 
an important modification in the scope and contents of 
the extensive work on the Philippine Islands now being 
issued by them. As originally planned and hitherto 
announced, the series was intended to furnish the ori- 
ginal sources, printed and documentary, for the history 
of the Philippine Islands only to the beginning of the 
nineteenth century. The reasons for this seemed ob- 
vious and sufficient. But so many and urgent requests 
have come from subscribers and reviewers for such ex- 
tension of the series as shall cover the entire period of 
Spanish domination, that it has been decided to modify 
the former plan in the manner here briefly indicated. 
It is proposed not to exceed the number of volumes 
already announced, — fifty-five. This can be done be- 
cause, in the original plan, to avoid a subsequent in- 
crease in the number of volumes, a certain amount of 
space was purposely left for possible future changes as 
a result of later investigations to be made in foreign 
archives, or on account of the necessary excision of 
extraneous or irrelevant matter from the printed works 
to be presented in this series. The new title will be 
" The Philippine Islands: 1493-1898."

Senator Hoar's Autobiography.* 



In commending to the reader Senator Hoar's 
" Autobiography of Seventy Years," no words 
of personal eulogy are called for from this pen. 
The man is known by his works, of which this 
book is a worthy record. Indeed, so packed is 
it with memorable things that the reviewer, se- 
lecting here and there a chapter or a passage 
for special notice, feels like one gathering peb- 
bles on the seashore. The author appears to 
have had somewhat the same feeling in writing; 
for he says, " I have no doubt that after these 
volumes are published, there will come up in 
my mind matter enough to make a dozen bet- 
ter ones." Having rarely kept a diary, he here 
writes, or rather dictates, from the abundant 
stores of a well- furnished memory. 

To the advantages of good birth and breeding 
was added the best education obtainable for a 
Massachusetts boy of his time. But even of 
this best he has a poor opinion. " There was," 
he writes, describing Harvard College, " as it 
seems to me in looking back, little instruction 
of much value. The good scholars and the bad 
went to the recitation together. The good ones 
lost the hour, and the poor scholars got the 
benefit of hearing the good ones recite." Yet 
he adds later, " There was something in the col- 
lege training of that day, imperfect as were its 
instruments, and slender as were its resources, 
from which more intellectual strength in the 
pupil was begotten than there is in the college 
training of the present generation." To the 
personality of the instructors he ascribes the 
difference. Among the best fitting schools of 
his day he names Mrs. Sarah Ripley's at Wal- 
tham, and gives in full Emerson's excellent 
obituary notice of that wonderful woman, of 
whom Edward Everett used to say that she 
could fill any of the professorships at Harvard. 
Emerson's tribute, not being included in his 
collected works, adds value to Mr. Hoar's vol- 
umes. The two members of the author's class 
(1846) whom he thinks the most entitled to 
fame are Dr. Calvin Ellis and Judge Nathan 
Webb, both now deceased. Again, however, 
he declares that the one member whose fame 
will last to remote posterity is Walter Mitchell ; 
and this fame he bases on a single poem of 
Mitchell's, « Tacking the Ship off Fire Island." 

•Autobiography of Seventy Years. By George Frisbie 
Hoar. In two volumes. With portrait. New York : Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 



Lane, also, the Latin grammarian and author 
of the song, " The Lone Fish Ball," he singles 
out for claims to immortality ; and so of Child 
and Short and Fitzedward Hall, and others. 
Let us settle the question which has thus baffled 
his generous indiscrimination, and find, without 
going beyond the title-page of his book, the 
name that will survive those of all his classmates. 
Speaking of his instructors, Mr. Hoar refuses 
to Professor Channing, that teacher of great 
writers, the praise we have learned to expect 
from his pupils. But he acknowledges that he 
may be wrong, and adds a generous word of 
eulogy for the professor's textbook on rhetoric 
and oratory. In this connection it is worth 
while adding that Mr. Hoar, searching English 
literature for a vigorous and manly style, the 
fit vehicle for conveying weighty thoughts to 
courts or juries or popular assemblies, advises 
the law student to give his days and nights to 
South's sermons. 

. Hastening on to more important matters, we 
read of the young lawyer's entry into public life. 
" Bat I happened one night in the autumn of 1850 
to be at a great mass meeting in the City Hall, at 
Worcester, which Charles Allen was expected to ad- 
dress. . . . Judge Allen, as he was somewhat apt to do, 
came in late. A vast audience had gathered and were 
waiting. Nobody seemed ready to speak. Somebody 
started the cry, « Hoar! Hoar! ' My father and brother 
were known as leaders in the Free Soil Party, and that 
I suppose made somebody call on me. I got up in my 
place in the middle of the hall in great confusion. There 
were shouts of ' platform,' • platform.' I made my way 
to the platform, hoping only to make my excuses and 
get off without being detected. But the people were 
disposed to be good-natured, and liked what I said. 
... It was printed in the Free Soil papers, and from 
that time I was in considerable demand as a public 
speaker. . . . The next year Worcester failed to elect 
her representatives to the Legislature, which were voted 
for all on one ticket and required a majority, and there 
was to be a second election on the fourth Monday of 
November. There was a delegate convention to nomi- 
nate representatives, of which I was a member. When 
the vote was announced, to my surprise and consterna- 
tion, I was one of the persons nominated." 

Mr. Hoar was then but twenty-five years old, 
and felt that he could not accept the nomination 
without his father's approval, which however 
he obtained and was elected, but refused a re- 
election. 

The young politician's modest ambition had 
been to build up a sufficient practice in Wor- 
cester to bring him in twelve or fifteen hundred 
dollars a year. He expected to remain unmar- 
ried, to hire a comfortable room where he could 
live in contentment with his books, and so to 
end his days. But in this instance the thatched 
cottage had to give place to the castle in Spain.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Want of space forbids an enumeration of Mr. 
Hoar's varied activities and unsought honors. 
Let it be borne in mind as not least to his credit, 
that he has now stood at his post in Washing- 
ton for thirty-five years, enduring a life dis- 
tasteful to him, at the urgent bidding of his 
constituents, and receiving a salary barely suf- 
ficient for his needs, when with far less labor he 
might have been earning fifty thousand dollars 
a year in law practice, and enjoying at the same 
time a mode of life much more congenial to his 
tastes. How truly he has obeyed his conscience 
in this devotion to the public service, his own 
words will show. 

" I have often been charged with a blind and zealous 
attachment to party. The charge is sometimes made 
by persons who consider that I desire to do right, but 
think that my understanding and intellectual faculties 
are guided and blinded by that emotion. Others are 
not so charitable. . . . But I will say two things : 
1. I have never in my life cast a vote or done an act 
in legislation that I did not at the time believe to be 
right, and that I am not now willing to avow and to 
defend and debate with any champion, of sufficient im- 
portance, who desires to attack it at any time and in 
any presence. 2. Whether I am right or wrong in my 
opinion as to the duty of acting with and adherence to 
party, it is the result not of emotion or attachment or 
excitement, but of as cool, calculating, sober, and de- 
liberate reflection as I am able to give to any question 
of conduct or duty." 

Then follows an able defence of his course in 
sticking to party and refusing to join the Anti- 
Imperialists. He believes the country is to be 
saved by the Republican party, not by the de- 
serters from its ranks or by the party opposed 
to it. Not every reader will be convinced, but 
the thorough honesty and the exalted motives 
of the writer are evident. On the burning 
question of how to deal with inferior races, he 
says: 

" We should have had little difficulty in dealing with 
the Negro or the Indian, or the Oriental, if the Amer- 
ican people had applied to them, as the Golden Rule 
requires, the principles they expect to apply and to 
have applied to themselves. We have never under- 
stood that in some essential matters human nature is 
the same in men of all colors and races. Our Fathers 
of the time of the Revolution understood this matter 
better than we do. . . . The problem of to-day is not 
how to convert the heathen from heathenism, it is how 
to convert the Christian from heathenism; not to teach 
the physician to heal the patient, but to heal himself." 

Memories of great men, most of them no 
longer living, crowd Mr. Hoar's pages. Elo- 
quent tributes are paid to those he admires, 
and his enemies are treated with courtesy and 
fairness. Of Benjamin F. Butler, however, he 
has little to say that is good. That little he does 
say most conscientiously, and then he proceeds 



to disclose his iniquities with a fulness that 
shows how deeply seated, and indeed how jus- 
tified, is his dislike of the man and his unscru- 
pulous methods. Nearly all that can be placed 
to Butler's credit is of a negative character : he 
contributed to certain victories in the war by 
being absent when the battles were fought, and 
he perhaps prevented Grant's renomination for 
a third term by the discreditable Massachu- 
setts appointments he urged upon the Presi- 
dent, thus disgusting his State and causing her 
to throw all her influence against Grant in the 
nominating convention. 

An epigrammatic presentation of the differ- 
ence in manner between Blaine and Harrison 
is worth quoting. "Blaine," says Mr. Hoar, 
"would refuse a request in a way that would 
seem like doing a favor. Harrison would grant 
a request in a way which seemed as if he were 
denying it." Of General Grant the author has 
many interesting reminiscences. He greatly 
admired the man and is generous in dealing 
with his faults. Speaking of Grant's reputed 
intemperance in early and middle life, Mr. 
Hoar regards his later correct deportment as 
more to his credit than if he had never yielded 
to temptation, — a curious reminder of the old 
sophistry that we must first sin in order to ac- 
quire virtue. One might perhaps better say 
that Grant deserved more praise for his self- 
restraint that if he had never been susceptible 
to temptation. 

Excellent accounts of four Republican na- 
tional conventions — at all of which the writer 
was present, and over one of which he presided 
— are among the notably instructive and read- 
able chapters of this work. Some matters hith- 
erto imperfectly understood are made plain 
by Mr. Hoar's narrative. His presiding over 
the convention of 1880, and his friendship for 
Garfield, appear to have contributed in no small 
measure to the latter's nomination. At one 
critical moment it was only the chairman's 
prompt and decisive ruling on a point of order 
that saved Garfield from generously throwing 
away his chance of victory. But this must be 
read to be understood. Passing to other mat- 
ters, we read with peculiar pleasure this tribute 
to his old friend, the late Senator Dawes : 

" I should like to put on record one instance of the 
generosity and affection of Mr. Dawes. He had not 
voted [on the River and Harbor Bill of 1882] when 
his name was called, expecting to vote against the pas- 
sage of the bill over the veto. But when he heard my 
vote for it, he saw that I was bringing down on my 
head a storm of popular indignation, and made up his 
mind that he would not throw the weight of his ex- 



1903]

ample on the side against me. So, contrary to his 
opinion of the merits of the bill, he came to my side 
and votedwith me. ... I would not probably put what 
I am about to say in an address to a Sunday-school, or 
into a sermon to the inmates of a jail or house of cor- 
rection. I cannot, perhaps, defend it by reason. But 
somehow or other, I am strongly tempted to say there 
are occasions in life where the meanest thing a man 
can do is to do perfectly right. But I do not say it. 
It would be better to say that there are occasions when 
the instinct is a better guide than the reason. At any 
rate, I do not believe the recording angel made any 
trouble for Mr. Dawes for that vote." 

Limitations of space bring this inadequate 
review to an abrupt close. The book shows 
here and there signs of haste in its dictation or 
proof-reading, or both. But these are trifles. 
Nor is unfailing accuracy of statement to be 
expected in so extended an effort of the mem- 
ory; but so far as a rapid reading can deter- 
mine, the book seems remarkably free from 
errors of this kind. In paying tribute to his 
ancestors and kinsfolk, Mr. Hoar speaks of 
Jeremiah Evarts as " the founder and Secre- 
tary of the American Board of Commissioners 
for Foreign Missions." The Haystack at Will- 
iams College tells a different story as to the 
origin of this association. Samuel J. Mills 
and his student comrades, and the Andover 
professors who later met these young men in 
Professor Stuart's parlor, would all seem to 
have claims prior to those of Jeremiah Evarts. 
But perhaps we are here merely disputing about 
words, without first determining what is meant 
by "founder." Percy F. Bicknell. 



Religious and Civil. Liberty ln 
America.* 



Mr. Charles Francis Adams opened his thesis 
on " Massachusetts, Its Historians and Its His- 
tory," with a picture of the two inscriptions on 
the front of the water-gate at the World's Fair 
at Chicago; the one on the left hand bearing 
the words, " Civil Liberty the Means of Build- 
ing up Personal and National Character," and 
that on the right hand reading "Toleration in 
Religion the Best Fruit of the last Four Cen- 
turies." To develop the thought of these two 
political principles, operating conjointly, and

of equal importance and value, was in part the 
aim of Mr. Adams in that thesis ; and it is a 
thought which well deserves the more extended 
development which it has since received. The 
second motto above named might, with better 
grace and more truth, have ascribed the ful- 
ness of its praise to the principle of Religious 
Liberty. Toleration does not rise to the height 
of the American standard in religious affairs. 
Mr. Adams proceeded to discourse conserva- 
tively of Toleration in Religion, and thus fol- 
lowed in words his chosen motto ; but his 
thought seems to have risen higher than his 
words, and to have reached the height of char- 
ity which American political practice has de- 
veloped, for his illustrations showed the people 
in possession of full Religious Liberty. 

The attitude of America toward the subject 
of freedom in religious affairs was, when first 
assumed, unique ; nor does it appear otherwise 
even now, for our pattern has not been copied 
by other peoples. The conception of a com- 
plete separation of church from state, present- 
ing the church as an institution standing by 
itself, entirely independent of the state and of 
other institutions, and the state as an institu- 
tion indifferent to the church in all its aspects 
save its independence, was a startling pro- 
position originally. It is such now to many 
conservative thinkers of the old world. Yet 
this has ever been a feature of American con- 
stitutional government. The principle was 
introduced into the policies of the world con- 
temporaneously with our Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. The political liberty announced by 
that instrument embraced as one of its factors 
an absolute freedom in entertaining and ex- 
pressing religious opinions, and in the practice 
of religious worship ; and this freedom was to 
be achieved and preserved by the perpetual 
divorcement of church from state. 

The freedom thus secured and protected is 
purely personal ; it pertains to the individual. 
The principle upon which we have separated 
church from state operates, in our political 
system, not negatively but positively. The 
people's government does not rest with leaving 
the individual alone as to his religious convic- 
tions ; it guarantees that he shall be continu- 
ously let alone. It denudes itself of office, 
mission, and duty, as to all religious questions. 
It disclaims the right to interfere with the 
individual conscience, and it proclaims that 
no such interference shall be allowed. Thus 
the right of private opinion and the right of 
free worship become constitutional rights, to

protect which the government is affirmatively 
pledged. 

The American doctrine has been by no one 
more clearly stated than by Dr. Philip Schaff, 
in his thesis on " Church and State in the 
United States," as providing for " A free 
Church in a free State," or, in other words, 
"A self-supporting and self-governing Chris- 
tianity, in independent but friendly relation to 
the Civil Government." Dr. Schaff did not, 
however, attempt to treat the subject elabo- 
rately ; he contented himself with a monograph 
opening up a discussion upon this interesting 
topic, inviting and urging later writers to 
develop the theme in historical form. This 
work has now been ably performed by Mr. 
Sanford H. Cobb, in his recent history of 
" The Rise of Religious Liberty in America," 
the first named in the group of books which 
has prompted this article. 

Mr. Cobb has a clear idea of the distinctive 
characteristics of the American doctrine, as 
well as of the peculiar features of the Old- 
World theory, and he has illustrated with 
perspicuity the differences between the two 
systems. His opening chapter on " The Amer- 
ican Principle" sets forth categorically the 
elements of the occidental system, as it appears 
operative and dominant to-day, after a cen- 
tury's successful experience. He contrasts 
with this "The Old- World Idea," of which 
he presents a historical sketch, tracing its de- 
velopment out of the conflicting theories of 
the early years of the Christian era. The 
American conception of religious liberty is not 
to be identified with or mistaken for Tolera- 
tion. It is neither a modification nor an ex- 
tension of Toleration, but rather its complete 
and irreconcilable antithesis ; for Toleration 
is a concession or a gift, tendered with the 
implication of a right to withhold, while Re- 
ligious Liberty is an inherent and inalienable 
right. Nor, on the other hand, is it to be 
confounded with Freedom of Conscience ; for 
to assert that the conscience is free is to state 
merely a psychological truism, while the polit- 
ical conception includes the element of freedom 
of worship. This conception must be observed 
in its distinctive individuality in order that 
the American doctrine be understood. Over 
against it, Mr. Cobb sets the Old-World con- 
ception of a system which, at numerous points, 
brings the political relations of the citizen into 
interference with his religious views and prac- 
tices. The prevailing thought in Europe has 
been that there was a necessary union between 



the Church and the State, " so intimate that 
whatever became of interest to one was matter 
for action by the other." Various phases of 
this union have been in vogue, in all of which 
the central thought was that the rights, priv- 
ileges, and interests of the Church required 
support by and protection from the State. Not 
all the agitation of the Protestant Reformation 
sufficed to shake the dominance of this ancient 
assumption. As Mr. Cobb succinctly states: 

" In the immediate reformation era there was in all 
the Protestant churches a practical unanimity of opinion,, 
that to the civil magistrate belonged a religious func- 
tion, in some, intimately related to the very life of the 
church, in others, restricted to the suppression of heresy. 
. . . Bossuet was substantially correct in saying that 
on one point all Christians had long been unanimous, 
the right of the civil magistrate to propagate truth by 
the sword; that even heretics were orthodox on this 
point." 

The attainment by America of her present 
elevated type of religious liberty was no holi- 
day episode. There was a gradual advance, 
traceable through a succession of struggles. 
The notable features of the present system are 
that it is distinctively American, and that its 
development has been accomplished on our 
soil, its origin being found in the colonial be- 
ginnings of our republican institutions. It is 
this accomplishment which Mr. Cobb outlines 
as "The Rise of Religious Liberty in America." 
The European theory was brought over to our 
shores by the settlers of several of the colonies, 
here to be shocked by sharp conflict with the 
freedom of conscience or " soul-liberty " cham- 
pioned by Roger Williams. These " Colonial 
Beginnings " are set forth in a brief chapter 
by Mr. Cobb, who then, after dividing the colo- 
nies into four classes, proceeds to illustrate 
each class historically. Three colonies intro- 
duced the Church of England establishment, 
three others the Puritan form of church govern- 
ment, while in four others there were various 
and changing forms of church establishment 
in succession. No character of union between 
church and state was admitted into the remain- 
ing three colonies, which Mr. Cobb classifies as 
"The Free Colonies." These three are the col- 
onies which have, in the main, set the example 
of religious liberty for all the states. The all- 
important but simple record of these colonies 
is presented in thirty-two pages. To portray 
the varying steps and the diverse and often 
agitating experiences through which the other 
ten states have progressed to their present po- 
sition, requires 347 pages, or nearly two-thirds 
of Mr. Cobb's book; an illustration of the 
fidelity of detail with which he has outlined 



1903] 



THE DIAL 



347 



the struggle for religious freedom. Now, all 
these thirteen original states, as well as all 
their younger sisters, occupy a practically com- 
mon ground ; and the national policy is vir- 
tually a re-affirmation and a guaranty of the 
policy of the states. The larger part of the 
work of assimilating the states to a common 
model was done during the revolutionary pe- 
riod, to which the author devotes a separate 
chapter ; and in a concluding chapter, he out- 
lines the post-revolutionary steps which have 
finally brought the state versions of religious 
freedom into substantial accord. 

The historical method is the one best adapt- 
ed to the elucidation of this subject, and Mr. 
Cobb exhibits the true historical spirit in his 
manner of treating it. The religious liberty 
which is the heritage of the American people 
of this century presents a phase of their coun- 
try's history which both warrants and demands 
the mode of treatment here employed; so that 
the volume before us may well assume the sub- 
title of " A History." 

Among the aspects of the religious liberty 
of America which are unique, should be noted 
its intimate relation to our familiar type of 
civil liberty. These two types of personal 
freedom are sistere ; they have the same par- 
entage, and they grew together. In turn each 
has stimulated, encouraged, and helped to nur- 
ture the other. Mr. Cobb's pages illustrate 
this fact clearly. The experiences of both Con- 
necticut and Rhode Island exemplify it, though 
not in the same way. A notable example is 
presented by our author, which appeared in 
Maryland. The first assembly held in that 
colony was composed wholly of Roman Catho- 
lics ; and Lord Baltimore, the proprietary, was 
known to be aiming to secure for his colony 
freedom of conscience. He sent over a pre- 
pared M Body of Laws," proposing that it be 
enacted. The assembly promptly rejected the 
document, and appointed a committee to pre- 
pare a code. In a few days, the committee 
reported the same code lately rejected, and the 
assembly without delay adopted the report and 
enacted the "Body of Laws." "Thus early 
did the American settlers learn to stickle for 
a point. They had no objection to the code 
itself, but to Baltimore's initiative. They would 
not formally ratify his will. What laws they 
passed must be their own, and transmitted to 
governor and proprietary for approval." And 
thus early did religious freedom begin to stiffen 
the backbone of constitutional civil liberty. 

Mr. Cobb's history finds timely companions 



in the other volumes of our group, and his 
broad and generalizing deductions are well sup- 
plemented by more minute statements of the 
experiences of the two commonwealths which 
became the examplars of their sister states. 
It was in the small state of Rhode Island that 
religious liberty came to its earliest and fullest 
fruition ; and this was also the organized com- 
munity which became the most distinctive rep- 
resentative of individual freedom in govern- 
ment. This colony and its sister Connecticut 
each grew from a revolt against the rigidity of 
the Massachusetts Theocracy. The reaction 
in Rhode Island was along the line of freedom 
of conscience. Starting with the advocacy of 
Soul-Liberty, the Rhode Island pioneers were 
from it led into, and came to adopt, the com- 
plementary theory of Individualism as the 
basis of healthy political action. Connecticut 
revolted from the theocracy on its political 
side. Very near to irony was the movement 
by which two of the leaders in the banishment 
of Roger Williams from Massachusetts soon 
after led an exodus to the wilds of Connecti- 
cut. It was a desire for greater liberty for 
the individual in governmental affairs which 
prompted their migration, and from this desire 
the emigrants advanced logically to broader 
freedom in matters of religion. Though start- 
ing thus by different routes, these colonies 
gradually grew into a similarity of views on 
the two subjects of Civil and Religious Liberty, 
and into leaders in the championship of these 
views. 

The early experiences of Rhode Island in 
this progress are graphically summarized in the 
two volumes entitled " Rhode Island, Its Mak- 
ing and Its Meaning," by Irving B. Richman. 
His work is essentially a biography of Roger 
Williams, in that it begins and ends with the 
life of this pioneer of religious liberty. But 
Carlyle has said that " the history of a nation is 
the biography of its great men "; and the history 
of Rhode Island and the biography of Roger 
Williams are practically convertible terms dur- 
ing the period indicated. It was Williams who 
took the lead in advocating and teaching liberty 
of conscience, and it was through his influence 
that his fellow- refugees advanced from Tolera- 
tion, through Freedom of Religious Belief, to 
the fulness of Religious Liberty, as the car- 
dinal principle of their government. But Will- 
iams was never a great governor or statesman ; 
and his Rhode Island associates preceded him 
in reaching the conclusion that Soul-Liberty 
necessarily implied Political Liberty, and in 



348

adopting this principle as the corollary of the 
other. 

Mr. Richman's account of the development 
of these mighty principles by the simple democ- 
racy which settled Rhode Island is a keen 
investigation into primitive government, and 
furnishes the best exposition extant of the 
Rhode Island experiment. He makes a detailed 
study of the political and constitutional begin- 
nings of the colony, recounts the boundary and 
other civil difficulties encountered, elucidates 
the details of what Fiske called " the turbulence 
of dissent" which raged during the life of 
Williams ; and through the whole story, traces 
the threads of Religious Liberty and Individ- 
ualism in government which finally interlaced 
in the web of the state's institutions. To 
develop this as the " Meaning of Rhode Island " 
is maintained as the dominant purpose of the 
author. A brief explanatory note by the emi- 
nent Mr. James Bryce emphasizes and pays 
due tribute to this praiseworthy purpose. 

The achievements of Connecticut within her 
own limited boundaries have been notable ; but 
they are far surpassed by the achievements of 
her people away from home. The migratory 
spirit that led to the first settlement of the 
Connecticut colony has descended to her chil- 
dren as an inheritance ; and " how it has pushed 
them over her borders, and made them state- 
builders," and animated other localities, parts of 
other states, with the same purposeful energy 
that has been the honor of the parent state, is 
the theme of Mr. Alfred Mathews, one of those 
descendants, in the volume entitled " Ohio and 
her Western Reserve : With a Story of Three 
States." This small book is packed full of 
interesting statistical information. Connecti- 
cut's charter claims reached westward over the 
northern limits of the present states of Penn- 
sylvania and Ohio ; and the well-known story 
of the attempts of Connecticut to make her 
western claims actual possessions by organized 
settlements, is here retold by Mr. Mathews 
with all its inherent glamour of romance. The 
experiences of the Connecticut men at Cushu- 
tunk and Wyoming are set forth in order to 
show and accentuate their relation to the later 
episode of the Western Reserve, and to exhibit 
a steady stream of virile enterprise, flowing 
from the fountain of Connecticut manhood, 
through northern Pennsylvania into northern 
Ohio. It is Mr. Mathews's thesis that the spirit 
which settled the Western Reserve, and which 
built it up into an important part of a new 
western state, has become the distinguishing 



element of the spirit of that state ; so that the 
Western Reserve was practically a new Con- 
necticut in the west, and Ohio, though a thor- 
oughly cosmopolitan people, owes to Connecticut 
more than to any other of the original thirteen 
States. 

Mr. Mathews develops his thesis along two 
leading lines. One traces the devotion to indi- 
vidual liberty, which always distinguished Con- 
necticut, and which there moulded Theocracy 
into the friendly relation now established be- 
tween state and church, through the Ordinance 
of 1787, which dedicated a great empire to 
Freedom and gave Ohio a place as a bul- 
wark against human slavery, into the final 
anti-slavery movement of which Giddings and 
Wade were such efficient factors. The other 
line follows the individuality of the leading 
Connecticut pioneers through their children to 
their descendants, and calls a long roll of 
statesmen and public officials, commencing 
with Wilmot and Grow of Pennsylvania, and 
closing with an almost innumerable list of 
prominent men of Ohio, who were of New 
England descent, and who have been at the 
head of state and national affairs, active in 
doing the work of finally ridding the country 
of the incubus of slavery, and giving a national 
scope to the principles of the Great Ordinance. 
It is the newer states, developed out of ter- 
ritory consecrated to Freedom, in which the 
American types of religious and civil liberty 
have now become so readily domesticated as 
to prove themselves part of the birth-right of 
the American citizen. The volumes in this 
group are persuasive to convince the reader 
of a fact which many political economists of 
recent years are urging upon public attention, 
namely, that the residents within the United 
States are growing into a thoroughly homo- 
geneous .people. James Oscar Pierce.

most gifted of our representative Americans. 
Few lives have been so significant in aspira- 
tion and accomplishment ; few have been so 
unappreciated. Again, this life was passed 
amid circumstances of nnequaled inspiration 
and fellowship with some of the greatest minds 
of the last century. The background of the 
life-history is vital with new and rare glimpses 
of the men and women whose names are synony- 
mous with the best literature and art of the 
Victorian period. A third cause for congratu- 
lation in this work is found in its editing. 
Mr. James's discrimination and taste in the 
use of his over-abundant material have been 
unerring. Whatever may be the individual 
opinion regarding his rhetorical manners, his 
writing bears a literary stamp of positive and 
permanent influence. His first sentence is 
almost daunting, with that peculiar haziness 
which must be accepted — and deplored — as a 
fixed quality of Mr. James's style. 

■ It may appear a new application of the truth that 
honour, where honour, as to any frank advance, attaches, 
is especially due to the light skirmishers, the eclaireurs, 
who have gone before ; yet there are occasions on which 
it comes home to us that, so far as we are contentedly 
cosmopolite to-day and move about in a world that has 
been made for us both larger and more amusing, we 
owe much of our extension and diversion to those com- 
paratively few who, amid difficulties and dangers, set the 
example and made out the road." 

The thoughts of Mr. James are well worth a 
second or third reading to gain full compre- 
hension of them; and as he continues, in his 
opening chapter, his pseudo-philosophic memo- 
ries of these eclaireurs, — these precursors in 
art and letters, to whom we owe an unacknowl- 
edged debt of gratitude, — he permits the reader 
to share his attitude of mind, as, in reverence 
and joy, he unfolds the contents of his rt boxful 
of old papers." 

With ' careful insistence Mr. James has 
emphasized the noble inheritance of William 
Story, his legacy of culture and conscience, his 
early opportunities and successess at the law, 
his published reports that required several edi- 
tions to meet the demand of his own time, and, 
in varied republications, have stable value. 
Such were tentative episodes of his manhood ; 
his true life began when, past thirty years of 
age, he made his first long visit to Italy, and, 
after anxious hours of conflict between expe- 
diency and aspiration, renounced the former for 
lifelong devotion to art and the life of the spirit. 
This decision met with the parental frankness, 
"Well, William, I've known in my life many a 
fool, but I've never known so great a one." 



The allurement of art came to him early in life, 
even in college days ; but its dominance as a 
factor must date from that commission, given 
him after his father's death, to model a com- 
memorative statue, — a testimony that his ear- 
lier dabbling had revealed promise. That he 
might accomplish a work worthy of his father's 
memory and his own art, he travelled and stud- 
ied in Italy in 1847, and, on returning to Amer- 
ica, found that his "heart had gone over from 
the Law to Art." 

This transference of life-interest from Amer- 
ica and an inherited profession to Italy and a 
slow though progressive recognition in the world 
of art, was really the crucial event in Story's 
life. Coming in early manhood, it left him 
long years for gradual unfolding of gifts, for 
happy, varied companionship with poets and 
artists. His tardy recognition, especially in 
America, his later honors as the sculptor of the 
Libyan Sibyl, Sappho, and Cleopatra, receive 
due attention in chronological order ; but after 
the earlier pages, the chief charm of the volume 
is derived from the vivid portrayals of the 
friends of that long Roman residence, the elu- 
sive "ghosts" and strong personalities that flit 
across the pages and are summoned into our 
presence by the biographer's magic. 

The one companion who made possible this 
life of aspiration and realization was the wife 
of his youth, the adored friend of all his friends, 
a woman of rare grace and endowment. To her 
" admirable ef&cacity " Mr. James bears ample 
testimony. Fully rounded, even to the golden 
wedding, was this happy married life. When, 
in 1894, Mrs. Story died, her husband received 
his "death-blow"; for him the few remaining 
months seemed only " a blank of silence." 

Among the earliest acquaintances in Italy 
with whom the Storys cemented a friendship 
of the past was Margaret Fuller Ossoli. With 
frank acknowledgment of her haunting power, 
Mr. James encounters this " Margaret- ghost " 
and finds her " evocation " (to use his favorite

interest, even affection, which Margaret Fuller 
won from the little circle of English and Ameri- 
can associates during these days of her nobler 
womanhood.

artists and authors, whose lives became inter- 
linked with that of Story, — Page and Craw- 
ford, Cranch and Boott. To the most intimate 
friends in America, Lowell and Charles Sum- 
ner, were written delightful letters during the 
first years in Rome, — letters of permanent 
value both as chronicles of literary friendship 
and also as revelations of the tense Italian con- 
flict and siege of Rome, 1848-1849. " Salad 
and conversation " became their only resources, 
while their hearts were anguished at the reports 
and evidences of suffering all around them. In 
lighter vein are descriptions of excursions into 
the fields with their glories, evenings of pleasure 
listening to Ristori and Modena, sojourns in 
Germany and impressions of the great leaders 
in thought and letters, — Humboldt and Nean- 
der, Ranke and Bettina von Arnim. 

In England the Story s always found conge- 
nial and appreciative friends, and the letters 
contain delightful hints of happy hours with 
Dickens, Leigh Hunt, and others of their time. 
These minor glimpses of literary charm, how- 
ever, must be abbreviated in attention to the 
major friendship of the Storys and the Brown- 
ings, of which these volumes furnish a true 
memorial. Here are side-lights upon the charac- 
ters of the poets that have never been fully 
revealed before. The letters and journals tell 
the story of the gradual acquaintance, ripening 
into life-long affection, between these two fami- 
lies of kindred race and tastes. We first hear 
of the intimacy in a letter to Lowell, — " My 
dear Jim," — from Rome, in March, 1849, 
when Story records their common pleasure as 
he read " The Biglow Papers " to " convulsed 
audiences at our weekly ' at home ' on Sunday 
evenings, giving them as well as I could the 
true Yankee note, and one evening I interpreted 
in the same tones one of them to the Brownings, 
who were quite as much amused and delighted 
as I." 

The letters of Mrs. Browning to Mrs. Jame- 
son, written four years later, have already given 
testimony to the assiduous devotion of herself 
and husband to their American friends during 
that fearful month of illness and death in the 
Story household. The loss of the first-born son 
was followed by days of intense anxiety for his 
sister, and durmg her convalescence she was 
the recipient of unsurpassed honors. To her, 
Thackeray read the unpublished version of 
" The Rose and the Ring," — " between daylight 
and dusk, as the great author sat on the edge 
of her bed." Later, Browning entertained the 
young friends of the Story home by reading 



" ' The Pied Piper,' which led to the formation 
of a grand march through the spacious Bar- 
barini apartment, with Story doing his best on 
a flute in default of bagpipes." 

Interwoven with the companionship of the 
Brownings during the months in Florence and 
Rome are sundry references to a common in- 
terest in the irascible but ill-treated Landor. 
All students of Browning's life are familiar 
with his sagacity and unswerving kindness 
in managing the affairs of this erratic but 
inspiring countryman. His efforts were sup- 
plemented by those of the Storys. One of the 
most interesting of the letters is written by 
Browning to Mrs. Story from Florence in 1859. 

" You need not be told how entirely we owe to you 
the delightful summer we have spent at Siena. Its one 
fault was its briefness. Ba is hardly so well as when 
she was let thrive in peace and quiet in that dear old 
villa and the pleasant country it hardly shut out. She 
is forced to see more people and talk of tener than suits 
her. I am very anxious to get away, and see no ob- 
stacle to our doing so by the end of the first week in 
November, when Mr. Landor will be finally established 
in his winter quarters. We are papering and carpen- 
tering and doing things superiorly. He is quite well; 
as gentle and affectionate as ever; and I shall regret 
his loss more than there is any use in dwelling upon, 
now that it must be. Ba enters the room at this mo- 
ment, saying, 'I wish we were in Rome!' Tell us, for 
we count on your goodness, the day you expect to be 
there, and when you get there, any news about houses, 
sunny ones, and prices of the same: in short, as usual, 
trouble yourselves infinitely for the sake of us poor 
do-nothings-in-return." 

Only three years of happy devotion remained 
for Browning before the death of his wife sev- 
ered his strongest heart-chords. The Storys 
hastened from Rome to Florence at news of 
Mrs. Browning's death, and here, standing in 
the consecrated rooms of Casa Guidi, the poet- 
husband uttered words of matchless tenderness 
and beauty, which have been retained in Mr. 
Story's journal. In summary of the years of 
productive life at this chosen home, Browning 
said: 

"The cycle is complete; here we came fifteen years 
ago; here Pen was born; here Ba wrote her poems for 
Italy. . . . Looking back at these past years I see that 
we have been all the time walking over a torrent on a 
straw. Life must be begun anew — all the old cast off 
and the new one put on. I shall go away, break up 
everything, go to England and live and work and 
write." 

Browning never lost his affection for the 
Storys, as occasional later letters testify. He 
advised the sculptor about his contracts and 
his books, wrote him fully regarding English 
sentiment during the Trent affair, and reiter- 
ated his personal cordiality ; but his departure

from Italy left a void of great depth in Story's 
life. 

In later life, when honors had been won, 
Story and his wife paid two or three brief 
visits to America ; but the records of them 
are seldom satisfactory. Their critical facul- 
ties were sharpened toward American defects, 
with that jealous patriotism which must ever 
characterize one who has lived long abroad 
yet is at heart a loyal American. Moreover, 
Story always realized that, despite commis- 
sions for statues, he never gained the sympathy 
of his countrymen in his aspirations. After 
*' Roba di Roma " had been rejected by Amer- 
ican publishers, but accepted in England, he 
wrote to Professor Norton : 

" It is in America no use for me to hope for anything. 
I do not expect to find a public there until I have ob- 
tained it elsewhere. They will resist to the last con- 
sidering me as anything but a poetaster, dilettante, and 
amateur." 

In a large measure this statement was true; 
his American contemporaries, with the excep- 
tion of a few friends, did not appreciate his 
facility or ideals. Mr. James has confessed 
the inadequacy of some of Story's work in art 
and letters ; yet one must not forget, amid the 
diffuseness of u A Poet's Portfolio " and other 
volumes, such worthy lyrics as " Io Victis " 
and "The Sad Country." Considered in the 
large, his life and work were significant in in- 
fluence and are destined to have honor in the 
history of American culture.

The Moral Law in the World of 
sh akesp e are.* 

" It is a commonplace of the schools," so I 
read that it stands in the writings of Pico della 
Mirandula, " that man is a lesser world." The 
old fancy of the microcosm was certainly, and 
is in many ways, but a fancy ; in some ways, 
however, true, and in none more than when we 
think of a great artist. For a good many years 
now, critics have pursued the thought, although 
I do not recall the idea in Aristotle or Samuel 
Johnson. Ruskin, with his obsession that all 
art was directly didactic, yet really understood 
that a man's work had didactic value chiefly in 
giving his particular idea of the world. That was 
what he looked for in the authors he read most,

Shakespeare's Portrayal of the Moral Life. By 
Frank Chapman Sharp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 



— Scott, Dante, Shakespeare. " Suppose," 
he says, " I had asked you to seek for Shake- 
speare's opinion. . . . Shakespeare knew men 
better than most of us, I presume." Shake- 
speare in his plays had a chance to put together 
the world as he saw it ; and because he did 
know men better than most of us, as well as for 
other reasons, his presentation has always been 
of immense interest. But I do not recall that 
his view of the world has ever before been sys- 
tematically considered from the standpoint of 
two books lately published. 

Mr. Moulton in his presentation of " The 
Moral System of Shakespeare," and Mr. Sharp 
in "Shakespeare's Portrayal of the Moral Life," 
have not precisely the same idea, but nearly 
enough to bring their books into natural com- 
parison. "The contents of these thirty-six 
plays make a world of their own," says the 
former. " It is surely possible to survey this 
imaginary world from the same standpoint from 
which the moralist surveys the world of reality." 
Mr. Sharp also speaks of ** the world " Shake- 
speare " has created "; his object is to give " an 
account of the moral life as it is represented 
upon Shakespeare's stage." 

So far, there cannot be much disagreement 
with our authors. We are accustomed enough 
to think of the world of any great writer of fic- 
tion, — Dickens's world, we say, or Thack- 
eray's ; and wherever there is any such large 
presentation of human life (except, according 
to Charles Lamb, in the Restoration Drama) 
there will be moral facts and phenomena, moral 
life or moral system. 

The last word offers a possible difficulty. 
We may speak of Shakespeare's portrayal of 
the moral life, because Shakespeare portrayed 
live men and women, and therefore must have 
made some portrayal of the moral life, — more 
through the nature of the circumstances, than 
he could of the physical or intellectual life. But 
can we speak of the moral system of Shake- 
speare without assuming that Shakespeare had 
a moral system, and that he made some sort of 
effort to present it? Mr. Moulton disclaims 
such an assumption in his first words. His 
title " is not intended to suggest that the man 
Shakespeare had formed in his mind a certain 
system of morals, which he proceeded to put 
into his plays." 

Neither of these books, then, has directly 
anything to do with Shakespeare as a drama- 
tist, poet, artist. Here is the work of " a man 
who was one of the most gifted students of 
human nature the world has ever seen," to use 



352 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Mr. Sharp's words. " The record that he left 
no worker in the humanities can afford to 
neglect." We need not raise the question how 
far the artist will play the moralist. The 
artist will present us men and women as he 
may choose, and for what causes he may see 
fit. In the presentation there must be a moral 
element (or they will be singular men and 
women), and that element we may study. 

As to the precise value of such study, these 
books have different ideas. Mr. Sharp says 
he will not, on the whole, consider " how far 
these offspring of a poet's imagination re- 
semble the men and women with whom scien- 
tific ethics attempts to deal." We may settle 
that matter for ourselves. If we think, with 
Ruskin, that " by Shakespeare humanity was 
unsealed to us," that " Shakespeare never be- 
trays his reader's moral judgment," that " all 
Shakespeare knows is, — that is the way God 
and nature manage it," we shall consider such 
a study an extremely valuable thing, even if 
we do not go to the length of Mr. Moulton's 
Zolaesque conception that the work of the poet 
offers us, as in a scientific experiment, possi- 
bilities of life which one may wait long before 
meeting in actuality. 

So much will give a general conception of 
two very interesting books. Both are to be 
read by the Shakespearean student with profit. 

In regard, however, to the net value of 
Mr. Moulton's studies, I must confess myself 
skeptical in spite of his ingenuity and his know- 
ledge of the plays. The chief standpoint is that 
of the analyist of plot. Now, whether through 
personal failing, or from unfortunate educa- 
tion, or from black prejudice, or for some other 
reason, I cannot bear Mr. Moulton's analyses 
of Shakespeare's plays, and never have been 
able to from the moment I read his earlier 
work on the subject. Mr. Moulton does some- 
thing to relieve me here : he says definitely 
that he has no idea of suggesting that Shake- 
speare really intended all these effects of de- 
sign which are so wonderfully pointed out. 
That is something : once grant that Shake- 
speare did not dream of there being a clash of 
primary and secondary plots through subaction 
in one play, a link action properly complicated 
and resolved in another, three phases of com- 
plicating intrigue with triple irony in a third, 
and the air seems a bit clearer. 

Still, I cannot help asking myself, if we ad- 
mit that Shakespeare made these complications, 
not out of the particular materials to which Mr. 
Moulton reduces them, but in other ways here 



unconsidered, is it not probable that there will 
creep in elements that will vitiate our conclu- 
sions ? Or, to be specific, let us take " Ham- 
let." Mr. Moulton notes in the main plot a 
six-fold system of graded wrong, with appro- 
priate nemesis and pathos, and regards the play 
as an illustration of " the association of acci- 
dent and overruling providence " which he 
finds definitely alluded to in the last speech 
of Horatio. That there are six wrong-doers 
(omitting Hamlet and counting Rosencrantz 
and Guildenstein as one), is clear ; also, that 
they are all come up with ; and, further, that 
in each case accident plays a part. But sup- 
pose the real reasons for this fact to have been 
ethically trivial. Suppose Shakespeare made 
Polonius die because he wished Laertes to have 
a father to revenge as well as Hamlet ; made 
Ophelia die because it was the only end for her 
madness, and gave him an opportunity in her 
funeral ; made the Queen die because it would 
have been inconvenient to have had her about 
at the end of the play ; made Kosencrantz and 
Guildenstein die, and, indeed, any or all of the 
rest, because they did in Belleforest, — and 
these may well enough have been Shake- 
speare's actual reasons, if we admit that he did 
not hold in mind the elements of analysis; — 
suppose that much of the nemesis comes from 
non-ethical causes, and much of the accident 
from stage convenience, and what sort of place 
does it all hold in a moral system ? 

Possibly it will be thought that Shakespeare 
(never betraying, etc., as above) would not 
allow such things to remain in a play, unless 
they actually presented his view of the moral 
cosmos. This opinion appears to me entirely 
to beg the question, and I incline to think, " If 
so, the less Shakespeare he," and even to add, 
and the more someone else. 

This objection, such as it is, does not lie 
with Mr. Sharp, who merely assumes on the 
part of Shakespeare a normal desire to be life- 
like in his characters, and an extraordinary 
ability to be so. It must be admitted that he 
does not concern himself with Shakespeare's 
own opinion. " Which if any of these different 
views represents the dramatist's own position," 
he remarks, " it is unnecessary to ask even were 
it possible to answer." What, then, is the im- 
portant thing ? Undoubtedly this : that, taken 
by and large, Shakespeare's world represents 
fairly the world he knew. With all the confu- 
sion and often chaos of dramatic presentation, 
the Shakespearean microcosm will practically 
represent the Elizbethan macrocosm, and there-

fore has the same interest for the student. We 
have in a small compass what were the ideas 
and motives of that world ; we can resolve their 
problems, or note ethical theories that have 
been propounded by later scholars, or determine 
principles that will be seen to obtain in the 
world of to-day. " If Shakespeare portrays 
human life aright," says Mr. Sharp, we are 
assured of such and such a principle. 

Such an object is rather different from Mr. 
Moulton's, and it is pursued by different means. 
Mr. Moulton, as has been said, presents a sys- 
tem based chiefly upon analysis of plot ; indeed, 
he analyzes the plot of every play. Mr. Sharp, 
on the other hand, rarely deals with any play as 
such. He is chiefly concerned with the char- 
acters as people, their motives, their desires, 
their judgments. To turn to " Hamlet " again, 
Mr. Moulton points out that the constant ne- 
mesis for wrong by means of accident gives a 
sense of a just Providence; that in the person 
of the hero we see the man of the inner life 
suddenly turned into the life without; that in 
the underplot of relief we get a more definite 
conception of the overthrown moral equilibrium 
of tragedy ; that various elements in the play 
indicate the sway of circumstance ; that the 
Ghost gives an idea of the true nature of what 
appears as supernatural. Mr. Sharp is inter- 
ested chiefly in Hamlet himself, in his concep- 
tion of reason, in his concern for his reputation 
after death, in his statement of a theory of 
values, in his skepticism or faith, his ideal of 
character embodied in Horatio, his view of the 
freedom of the will. It would not be quite 
correct to say that Mr. Sharp concerns himself 
with individuals, and Mr. Moulton with the 
more general aspects of life offered by the com- 
binations of the dramatist ; but such is the gen- 
eral tendency. 

It is probably unnecessary to express any 
opinion as to the comparative excellence of 
these two presentations. One is the work of 
a student of literature, the other of a student 
of philosophy. It is natural enough, perhaps, 
that the philosopher should have a more tech- 
nical and more available view of what is to be 
included in the term M moral " than the man 
of letters. For myself, I read with more in- 
terest about motives, right and wrong, con- 
science, than about moral balance, retribution, 
life in equilibrium, the momentum of character. 
These latter conceptions are moral ideas, but 
they do not seem to get down to the real phe- 
nomena and principles of morality. Let us 
suppose we are taking Shakespeare as a guide : 



I should prefer to learn from him by a num- 
ber of examples the way in which men come 
to do great wrong, let us say, than to infer 
from some of his plots that there is an over- 
ruling Providence that works by what seems 
accident. 

Whichever be better, I note with interest 
the abandonment by both writers, save in mo- 
ments perhaps of forgetfulness, of the view 
that Shakespeare's moral ideas have any espe- 
cial value as his. We are far removed from 
Ruskin's " There are certain men who know 
the truths necessary to human life ; they do 
not ' opine ' them ; and nobody's opinions on 
any subject are of any consequence as opposed 
to theirs." Shakespeare is no moral oracle 
imparting sound principles in aesthetic forms. 
Our authors regard him as presenting life 
truly, and find it convenient to study life in 
his plays just as a scientist may prefer to study 
Nature in a museum or a laboratory rather 
than out of doors, because he finds there the 
particular things he wishes to study, selected 
from the exuberance of the universe and put 
in such order that it is convenient to consider 
them. Edward E. Hale, Jb. 



A History of Prehistoric Times.* 

The earliest scene of authentic history is the 
Valley of the Nile. When the curtain rises, 
forty or fifty centuries before our era, it reveals 
in that region a civilization that must have 
been the product of a long period of develop- 
ment. But the story of its growth is a sealed 
book. Recent discoveries have, indeed, thrown 
considerable light on these early ages ; still, it 
can hardly be said that our knowledge has 
penetrated very much further back into time. 

But of all questions, those of origins are 
perhaps the most fascinating. It is not strange, 
then, that these border-lands have attracted 
many earnest students. Among the more re- 
cent workers in this field is Mr. J. F. Hewitt, 
formerly commissioner at Chutia Nagpur, In- 
dia. Mr. Hewitt's interest in ethnological 
questions was first roused in 1863, when he 
began his official life in Southern India among 
a people whose social organization is of the 
most primitive order. In 1894 he began to 
publish his investigations in the form of a se- 
ries of essays entitled " The Ruling Races of

Prehistoric Times." These were followed, in 
1901, by a large volume of some six hundred 
pages, in which his earlier theories are re- 
stated in a somewhat modified form, and worked 
into a chronological system which is at least 
interesting. 

Mr. Hewitt's present book, " A History of 
Prehistoric Times," will not seem unreasonably 
large when we consider the fact that it pre- 
tends to trace the path of civilization through 
a period of nearly twenty thousand years. The 
author limits his discussion to the subject of 
how the primitive man reckoned years and 
seasons ; but incidentally many other matters 
are brought in. It cannot be said that the his- 
tory of the year is the most valuable contribu- 
tion that could be made to historic science ; but 
if Mr. Hewitt's conclusions were trustworthy 
his work would add greatly to our knowledge 
of the earlier ages, and would push the bounda- 
ries of history far back into prehistoric fields. 

The author takes us back nearly twenty- five 
thousand years into Central India. He finds 
there the earliest form of social life, the village- 
community of the Dravidian Malays. These 
people, nomadic at first, soon learned to culti- 
vate rice, and with agriculture came a settled 
life. Trees were cleared away and rude shel- 
ters built. In the centre of the clearing, a 
grove was left under the shade of which the 
festivals of the race were celebrated in dance. 
These villages were grouped into provinces, 
and these again sometimes into confederacies. 
Family kinship was unknown ; village was 
married to village, and descent was traced 
through the mother. As the villagers were farm- 
ers, it was necessary for them to know the se- 
quence of the seasons ; this led them to study 
the stars. The god of this early age was the 
pole-star, then in the constellation Cepheus. 
This gives the historian his initial date : the 
village community must have existed in India 
before 21,000 B. C. 

Not long after this began a period of mi- 
grations. The Dravidians moved northward 
and westward, up the Indus and along the 
shores of the Persian Gulf, till they finally 
reached the Euphratean delta. Here on the 
plains of Shumir the Indian star-worshippers, 
later called Chaldaeans, at last settled. From 
this region two routes of further migration are 
traceable ; the one running through Southern 
Arabia to Abyssinia and thence down the Nile 
to Egypt, the other and earlier leading toward 
the headwaters of the Tigris and the Euphrates 
and thence on into Asia Minor. 



In Mesopotamia these Indian workers of the 
soil came into contact with the Accadian Finns, 
a pastoral race from the far north. These two 
races were soon joined by a third : the men 
with the bow. These were a tall people, with 
fine regular features and wavy hair. The au- 
thor traces them back to the Cro-Magnon races 
of the early Palaeolithic age, the cave-dwellers 
of the Garonne region. The date of their 
migration is placed at 17,000 B. C. From the 
union of these races, so utterly unlike in ap- 
pearance, in social institutions, and in mode of 
life, sprang the Iberian Basques, the people 
who settled Europe in the Neolithic age. To 
the arts of the Dravido-Finns the northwestern 
people added pottery and brick-making. From 
Armenia this new race spread eastward and 
westward ; a few thousand years later they 
were in Greece and Italy. They were the 
builders of the oldest remains at Tiryns and 
Mycenae. Later they appeared in Spain and 
Brittany. 

About 8000 B. C. another great change 
came over the world. The old social organi- 
zation based on federated village communities 
began to be somewhat modified by the intro- 
duction of a commercial element. Indian 
traders passed up into the Mediterranean re- 
gion, everywhere finding the villages that the 
Basques had built in the later Stone Age. 
These villages now grew into large cities, such 
as the Athenian Acropolis and the Italian 
Caere. The traders brought with them the use 
of bronze (the Bronze Age had begun in 
India about 15,000 B. C). The migratory 
movements continued. Tribe after tribe came 
up from the Indus and passed on to the Pillars 
of Hercules. Tribe after tribe left the shades 
of the Ardennes region and travelled the long 
way to the Himalayan slopes. Amalgamation 
continued and new types were constantly form- 
ing. On the whole the age was a peaceful one. 
But soon came a conquering race from the 
North and disturbed the peaceful dances under 
the village-tree. These conquerors were the 
M Northwestern Goths, — the race of cattle 
herdsmen who based their national organiza- 
tion on family property and divided their lands 
. . . into tracts owned by the families united 
to form tribal territories as the village com- 
munities formed provinces. They were the 
Teutonic Frisians, and Saxons," and left their 
homes about 10,000 B. C. Arriving in India, 
they reorganized that country, and an era of 
great commercial prosperity set in, continuing 
from 7000 B. C. to about 4000 B. C. The

latter date marks the coming of .the Aryans, 
" a Gotho-Celtic people " who overcame the 
commercial princes, and with whose invasion 
began a new era — the Iron Age. 

A brief review such as the one just given 
can, of course, do but scant justice to a system 
like Mr. Hewitt's. But when a writer proceeds 
to construct and reconstruct history by methods 
radically different from those in general use, an 
effort should be made to state at least a few of 
his leading conclusions. 

Mr. Hewitt assumes that primitive peoples 
are conservative almost to the point of absolute 
inertia; he therefore believes that a great deal 
of the world's early civilization has come down 
to us in some form or other. These survivals 
he finds in myths, in rituals, in the classic 
festivals, in existing customs, in words, and 
particularly in the Sanskrit writings. That a 
continued search for the fossilized forms of 
earlier civilizations is a laudable effort, will be 
admitted by all; the difficulty comes when we 
are called on to determine what is and what is 
not a survival. But such problems evidently 
do not interest Mr. Hewitt. His materials do 
not appear to have been sifted ; he brings to- 
gether everything that can in any way be 
twisted into the appearance of a survival. And 
if an institution cannot be shown to go back 
more than ten thousand years, the inferential 
method easily carries the author's conclusions 
back another ten thousand. 

He also assumes that all myths have some 
significance, usually historic ; if they do not, 
why were they invented? Still, every stu- 
dent of history knows that myths have often 
been invented for no good reason whatever. 
But supposing the author's contention to be a 
good one, how are we to know whether the 
myth is properly interpreted ? Significant or 
not, the legend will never yield great results 
in historical study. 

Bad as the author's choice of materials un- 
doubtedly is, the manner in which he uses 
them is far worse. His method is the compar- 
ative method gone mad. Irish tales are used 
in elucidating institutions that developed in 
Mesopotamia twenty thousand years ago. We 
are told that the Jews blew rams' horns at the 
opening of their year, because it originated 
with the sun-god who was born when the sun 
was in the sign Aries, about 15,000 B. C. 
Tacitus's description of the Germans is used to 
illustrate conditions on the shores of the North 
Sea ten thousand years before that writer was 
born. Not only does the author ignore time 



and space in the use of his " evidence," but 
forced interpretations frequently appear. We 
are told, for instance, that when Tacitus speaks 
of the Germans as a people who did not live in 
cities, he meant the Saxons and Frisians only. 

Perhaps the most interesting part of Mr. 
Hewitt's work is the chronology. He believes 
that certain myths and Vedic poems record 
the position of the pole-star at various periods, 
as well as the constellations in which the sun 
was found at the equinoxes. Astronomy is then 
made use of to determine the years or periods 
of years. It cannot be said, however, that the 
author's use of the sidereal science to determine 
chronology convinces the reader as to its gen- 
eral utility. 

It should be added that the author seems to 
have mastered the whole field of myth and le- 
gend. The book contains a vast amount of 
material, much of it perfectly incomprehensible 
to the general reader. But all is skilfully used 
and carefully systematized. Not so much care 
has been bestowed on the literary part of the 
work. Laubence M. Larson.

The " book of the year " in English poetry is 
undoubtedly provided by the new volume of Mr. 
Kipling's poems. We mean by this that no other 
book of poetry produced of late has attracted any- 
thing like the same amonnt of attention, or been 
treated with so much consideration by the organs 
of criticism. That this is proper, considering the 
author's world-wide fame, we make no pretence of 
doubting; yet we are by no means sure that some 
modest and unheralded product of the same season

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



may not, in the ultimate reckoning, tarn out to 
occupy a larger place in the world's regard. Even 
the great reputation of Mr. Kipling has shown signs 
of being overworked during the past few years, and 
we cannot say that the contents of the new volume 
are of a nature to stem the current of reaction from 
the excessive praise of which he was the subject not 
so long ago. Turning over the pages of " The Five 
Nations," we renew acquaintance with the noble 
" Recessional," with the striking " Kitchener's 
School," «tnd with that canting apology for im- 
perialism, "The White Man's Burden." Other 
familiar pieces — " The Truce of the Bear " and 
" Our Lady of the Snows," we also find. Among 
the new pieces we discover a group of fine poems 
having the sea for their inspiration, a group of 
which the finest is called " White Horses," and 
opens with this spirited and imaginative stanza : 
u Where run your colts at pasture ? 
Where hide your mares to breed ? 

'Mid bergs about the Ice-cap 
Or wove Sargasso weed : 

By chartless reef and channel, 
Or crafty coastwise bars, 

But most the ocean-meadows 
All purple to the stars I " 

But strong as this poem is, and as are the sea- 
poems that go with it, we are reminded by the very 
theme of them that England still possesses a poet 
of the seas who is a poet indeed, that Mr. Swinburne 
has so far surpassed the best of these verses that a 
comparison with the younger singer would be an act 
of wanton cruelty. Turning the leaves still further, 
we come to " The Feet of the Young Men," a swing- 
ing piece in the most characteristic Kipling manner. 
Then there are some dignified memorial stanzas ded- 
icated to Cecil Rhodes, and some even more impres- 
sive stanzas dedicated to General Joubert. Passing 
over many other things well worthy of mention and 
of praise (although always qualified), we come at 
last to what the author calls " Service Songs," which 
occupy the closing third of the volume. These, at 
least, bear no conceivable relation to poetry as that 
term has hitherto been understood. They are 
extraordinary compositions, no doubt, full of vigor- 
ous life and acute observation of humankind as 
represented by the soldier, but their slanginess and 
the general brutality of their diction puts them out- 
side the pale of literature, if literature and beauty 
are still to be considered as being concerned with 
one another. These strictures must be held to 
apply in considerable measure to the contents of 
the earlier pages as well, although before we reach 
the " Service Songs," we do not come upon such 
unrelieved tracts of uncouth vulgarity. If only we 
might have Mr. Kipling's gold without its heavy 
admixture of dross ! A generation hence, when he 
shall be read only in the anthologies, he will prob- 
ably seem a more important figure in our literature 
than he can now seem to readers of the discrimi- 
nating class, who find it impossible to blink the dis- 
tressing and unlovely aspects of his work, to say 
nothing of its pernicious ethical tendencies. 



Mr. Alfred Cochrane is a poet of light and grace- 
ful quality whose work commends itself to a refined 
taste, and who may be read with much quiet satis- 
faction. His "Collected Verses," now published, 
comprise the contents of two earlier volumes, with 
the addition of a considerable quantity of matter 
that has not hitherto appeared in book form. Sing- 
ing, as these verses do, no " epic hymns of Life and 
Time," they are as far removed as possible from 
Mr. Kipling's turgid measures, but they have a 
charm of their own. Most of them are indeed 
plucked leviore plectro, and their themes are such 
as the cricket field, the golf links, and the ball- 
room ; they are, in brief, vers de societi of typical 
sort. In his more serious mood, Mr. Cochrane 
writes such lines as " Integer Vita," which we re- 
produce. 

" A man with sympathies that moved 

To human interests, human needs ; 
And with unwearied kindness proved 

By courteous words and friendly deeds. 

" One, upon whom his neighbors thrust 
The burden of their constant cares, 
A counsellor to love and trust. 
He mixed in other men's affairs. 

11 Yet with the soul serene, for which 
The restless thinker vainly looks, 
That made him in contentment rich 
Among his birds and flowers and books. 

"For in his faith abiding strong, 

Nor by regret nor doubt dismayed, 
He st^od asunder from the throng, 
And spake with Conscience unafraid. 

" No fierce ambition for the strife, 
No master wit to scheme and plan, 
But through a sane well-ordered life 
The wisdom of the upright man." 

Nature and love are the themes of Mr. Joseph 
Russell Taylor in " The Overture." The author's 
manner is characterized by spontaneity, careless- 
ness of the poetical conventions, and an audacious 
realism that sometimes takes the breath away. We 
quote "The Bachelor in the Wood," which is so 
good a poem that it deserves a less prosaic title. 

" Beauty I trod, who footed in the wood 
A midnight galaxy of violets, 
A milky way of flushed spring- beauties, starred 
With pleiads of all-golden adder-tongue, — 
How could that blossomed fire be else than this, 
The height of a woman's ankle in the wood ? 

" Passion I breathed, who found all air a harp 
To the mad brown-thrushes quivering and quick, 
The spaces in that daring minstrelsy 
Thronged with enkindling echoes, sparrow and wren, — 
How could that warbled fire be else than this, 
The height of a woman's lips within the wood ? 

" I trod the stars, I breathed the flame ; but love, 
O April, can I find it here alone ? 
Those send the bees to find their sister-flowers, 
These sing unto their mates ; but love, my love ? 
Is it where the hawk hangs on the morning cloud, 
The height of a woman's heart above the wood ? " 

Here is something very like the "lyric cry," and 
we find it again and again in Mr. Taylor's fresh 
imaginative utterance. His sonnets, also, have

marked beauty, although more restrained. This 
one is called " Veteres Ineunt Proscania " — one 
of a series of Latin titles happier than those of the 
author's English choosing. 

" Ah once again upon the rock to lie 
Under the water-maple, half awake, 
Shnt in from wind and sun, mountain and lake. 
Save for a space of dimpling under-sky, 
With you beside me in a boat hard by, 
Yon with your book of verse beneath the bough, 
Up whose green curtains, and across yonr brow, 
Ripples of water-fire forever die ; 
And ever while the squirrel, hidden above, 
From leafage burdened yet with yesterday 
Shakes down light rains on us, reading to me, 
To hear yonr voice seem near and far away, 
Reading of her who to the sacred grove 
Led the blind wanderer, Antigone." 

Mr. Russell's volume will well repay the atten- 
tion, although its approach, through a queer com- 
position called " Penelope in Love," is set with 
thorns. 

Mr. Frederic Crow nin shield has many excellent 
opinions upon politics, education, yellow journalism, 
the temperance problem, and other serious themes 
— and he expresses them in lines that measure up 
as verse, and have the correct number of accents, 
but somehow he fails to produce the effect of poetry. 
A sonnet on " Utopia" may be given as an example. 

" It seems scarce credible to us to-day 

That thon, good More, shouldst in thy time create — 
When Violence was Right — a perfect state, 
Wherein a man might work his chosen way, 

And yet unto the Weal his best convey ! 

And thou didst hold that if we could abate 
Our fatuous lust for gold, all fraud, all hate 
From very inanition would decay. 

Alack, to those who have not read thy book, 
Its title meaneth but a madman's dream, 
And thy fair commonwealth a wild conceit ! 

Oh, madmen they who will not squarely look 
At life with thy sane eyes. For well I deem 
Thine is no dream, but a great truth concrete." 

We are in hearty agreement with these sentiments, 
but why should they masquerade in verse? Mr. 
Crowninshield's volume is called " Tales in Metre, 
and Other Poems," and we may admit the metre 
as unimpeachable. But we should not call any of 
his pieces poems, although they have touches of 
poetic fancy here and there, especially when they 
reflect the impressions made by art and travel upon 
the cultivated mind of their author. 

Dr. William J. Fischer is a young Canadian who 
has put forth a thin volume entitled "Songs by the 
Wayside." We quote two stanzas from " A Song 
of the Sea." 

" sea, bounding sea ! thy fond music is ringing, 
Thy voices vibrate in their wave-symphony, 
And bring to my heart such a wealth of sweet singing, 
That fills me with joy and a feeling of glee. 

" And fain would I be a glad child of the ocean, 

And feel, on my lips, the cool breath of thy waves, 
That stir in their hissing and frenzied, wild motion 
The fishes at play, in their deep marine caves." 

A friend of the writer, who contributes a " fore- 
word," informs us that the voice of Dr. Fischer 
"is a young, glad voice." He also tells us that 



" here we find no lines reminding us of Poe, Long- 
fellow, or Lanier." We certainly do not. But 
among the things that we do find, and that obtrude 
upon our attention, are a great number of unneces- 
sary and irritating elisions, and a quite unaccount- 
able sprinkling of commas in the wrong places. 

A volume of verse-triflings by Mr. Edward W. 
Barnard has for its title " The Conceits of a General 
Lover." At least, this is the legend of the title- 
page, although the word "Conceits'" appears as 
" Conceit " on the back and covers of the volume. 
We quote " Urbs in Rure — A Moving Tale ": 

" In vain the May wind wanders on 

And softly whispers me, 
When sultry summer days are done, 

Of nights in Arcady. 
But what great miracle shall my 

Arcadia restore ? 
The place that knew Calphnrnia 

Will know her nevermore. 

" For months a Damoclean sword 

Hung trembling o'er us all : 
We shut our eyes, and laughed and sung, 

But knew that it would fall. 
'Twas on the year's unhappy scroll 

Immutably decreed, 
That she must go — Calphnrnia ! 

And now she 's gone, indeed. 

" She lives ? Ah ! Yes she lives, but where ? 

Not where our hearts are still ; 
But in pa's new ' colonial ' 

At East Westmoreland ville. 
A suburb — near, and yet so far ! — 

Whence — O the cruel fate — 
For him that's faring cityward 

The last train leaves at 8!" 

This bit of verse has some slight point to it, but the 
case is an exception. Most of the pieces are flat and 
unprofitable, besides showing an almost incredible 
defect of ear. How some of the stanzas could have 
been thought to be written in metre passes compre- 
hension. 

"Semanoud" is a narrative poem, in stanzas, 
of a slave who loved a princess. The princess 
spurned his mission, and sent him to labor in the 
quarries. By-and-by he saves her life at the cost 
of his own, and she is sorry that she had spurned 
him. " A Dream " is one of the lesser pieces in 
this collection. 

" I dreamed, my love, that you and I had died 
And passed away to some fair southern clime, 
Where roses bloomed beside a sapphire sea, 

Where all the radiant world was Love, and Time 
Was but Eternity. 

" I waked, my love, but knew that you and I 
Only in dreams can meet forevermore. 
The pine and palm were not more far apart, 
Yet, 'cross the sea from that wide distant shore 
You speak unto my heart." 

The author of these poems is Miss H. Talbot 
Kummer, a talented young woman of Baltimore, 
who has spent much time abroad. 

" Fate and I, and Other Poems " is the work of 
Miss Gerda Dalliba. The poems are outpourings 
of the sentimental sort usually written by young 
women, "A Mood " being a fair example.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



" Calm the morning falls from Heaven, 
Dim and over-spread with clouds, 
And the mountain-tops are driven 
Back into their mists of shrouds. 
"And sweet rest is on the valleys, 
Weary of their swaying grass ; 
For the sun far eastward tarries, 
And the winds no longer pass 
" To and fro — but all are sleeping 
Quiet in the soft gray shy ; 
And the peaceful Heavens are weeping — 
It would save my heart, could I ! " 

Miss Hattie Horner Loutban's " Thoughts Adrift " 
are little poems of nature and the human heart. 
There is nothing very- distinctive about them, al- 
though now and tben a pretty conceit is voiced, as 
in the case of the lines called " Inconstancy." 

" The Night unto the New Moon clung — 

Moon, so sweet, so fair, so young ! 
And o'er his face her hair was flung, 

A veil of misty light. 
He said : ' O Moon, why haste away ? 
'Tis dark, so dark, without thy ray : 

1 love thee as can not the Day.' 

So sang the fickle Night. 
" The Moon upon Night's breast lay cold — 
O Moon so pale, so sad, so old ! 
He said : ' Why tarry. Moon ? Behold 

How many hours thou'st stayed I 
These arms another soon shall fold — 
The Sun, all youth and warmth and gold.' 



" Then swift came Day, the conquerer bold. 
So died the Night, betrayed." 

" A Field of Folk " is the titular poem in a vol- 
ume by Miss Isabella Howe Fiske. The suggestion 
is from Piers Plowman, and this is the poem itself : 
" Piers Plowman, hermit-robed, one May of yore. 
Stood on the hills, his soul at gaze to see 
Round Holy Church, fair Malvern's priory, 
Outlying counties spread, his eyes before. 
And when the vision passed, his waking spoke 
Of a fair woman and a field of folk. 
" My hermit heart wins Malvern's hills to-day 
And, looking far afield on human life, 
Sees the same toil, still the same timeless strife. 
And a fair woman stands midmost the way. — 
Who has so climbed can scarce look out in vain 
A summer season on the busy plain." 
The verse of Miss Fiske has a noticeable element 
of originality, which may be illustrated by "An 
Apostle of the Oak." 

" I believe in the mighty oak 
Conceived by God, 
Born of the virgin sod, 
Suffered the woodman's stroke, 
Whose leaves were crucified 
By the frost's sting, 
And rose again in spring 
Toward Easter heavens wide, 
At the right hand of Nature spread 
It heals the sick, 
Restores the quick, 
And broods above the dead. 
And in thy spirit mine believes, 
In temples of the catholic wood, 
Communion of the good, 
Made audient in the leaves. 
Then since new life thou hast in ken 
And pardon for who need, 
I face the east, repeat the creed, 
And standing cry : Amen." 



We close this review with examples of the work 
of two Canadian women, one a new-comer, the other 
a writer of past achievement. The new-comer is 
Mrs. Katherine H. McDonald Jackson, and her 
volume has " Summer Songs in Idlenesse " for a 
title. The following lyric of the reflective type is 
called " Life ": 

" Light ships afloat on a misty Sea 
With pain in store. 
Anchored by Love from Eternity 
To Time's bleak shore. 

" The ropes that moor them to Happiness 
Are cobwebs frail : 
111 can they bear the strain and stress 
Of Sorrow pale. 

" The cable of Hope from the anchor slips 
All worn by tears. 
And out to sea drift the frail white ships 
Mid doubts and fears. 

" But as Death's cold tide in the crnel night 
Bears them away, 
Who knows where they go as they pass from sight 
Into Distance grey ? " 

There are three long poems in Mrs. Jackson's vol- 
ume, one an idyl of love in June, one a legend from 
the Isles of Shoals, and one a blank- verse setting 
of the story of Penthesilea. The closing lines of 
this latter poem may be reproduced. 

" Thus Achilles felt 
A woe that would for aye his soul impress. 
While keeping vigil there beside the dead. 
Till o'er his anguish kindly, gentle Night 
Drew the soft mantle of her shadowed veil 
And Sleep possessed him. Sleep the highest gift 
Of all the Gods to Mortals when in pain 
Of mind or body. Sleep that gives to man 
A foretaste of the Everlasting Rest." 

This has just the right touch of simple dignity, a 
touch not unsuggestive of the older " Hellenics " of 
Landor. 

The city worker who has been off on his vacation, 
according to Miss Wetherald, returns to his desk — 

" Tangled in stars and spirit-steeped in dew." 
He is made the subject of a sonnet, and the phrase 
"Tangled in Sfcars" serves as a pretty title for 
both the sonnet and the volume which it introduces. 
Another sonnet, "At Waking," is one of the most 
exquisite of Miss Wetherald's songs. 

" When I shall go to sleep and wake again 

At dawning in another world than this, 
What will atone to me for all I miss ? 
The light melodious footsteps of the rain, 
The press of leaves against my window pane, 
The sunset wistfulness and morning bliss, 
The moon's enchantment and the twilight kiss 
Of winds that wander with me through the lane. 

" Will not my soul remember evermore 

The earthly winter's hunger for the spring, 

The wet sweet cheek of April, and the rush 
Of roses through the summer's open door ; 

The feelings that the scented woodlands bring 
At evening with the singing of the thrush? " 

Nearly all of these poems are nature lyrics, and 
many of them share the delicate beauty of the son- 
net just reproduced.

Briefs on New Books. 



So rarely now does Mr. Thomas Bai- 
ii^aging tifle*. le 7 Aldrich publish anything that his 

"Ponkapog Papers" (Houghton) 
will be sure of a welcome. The queer name, which 
may well have puzzled many a reader of "From 
Ponkapog to Pesth," designates an actual town, 
formerly an Indian reservation, a few miles south 
of Boston, and is to be found in the gazetteer. 
In this quiet retreat the author has put together 
sundry entertaining odds and ends, which "no 
more dream of inviting comparison between them- 
selves and important pieces of literature " than 
Ponkapog dreams of mistaking itself for a metro- 
politan centre. The sketch of Robert Herrick, 
which concludes the volume, is the only piece of 
any length, and is an excellent appreciation of the 
poet. The rest of the book is devoted to " Leaves 
from a Note Book " and " Asides," whose charm 
lies in their daintiness of execution. But this very 
exquisiteness of polish makes even the slightest flaw 
conspicuous. As an instance of the poet Thom- 
son's notorious laziness, the author represents him 
as standing "in his garden of an afternoon, with 
both hands in his waistcoat pockets, eating peaches 
from a pendent bough," — a difficult feat, one would 
think, even for a man of the most active habits. 
However, lazy folks always take the most pains. 
There is a subtle psychological truth in the remark 
of our Ponkapogian philosopher that " extraordi- 
nary names never seem extraordinary to the per- 
sons bearing them "; and he favors us with some 
names almost too good to be true. He quotes with 
approval, one regrets to note, Buckle's assertion that 
" after the love of knowledge, there is no passion 
which has done so much good to mankind as the 
love of money." But there is consolation in the 
thought that Buckle is now an exploded authority. 
These are trifles, to be sure ; but of such, and of 
many much better ones, the book is composed. The 
little poem on Japan, which sings its way through 
ten neatly-turned quatrains, is perhaps the gem of 
the volume. 



Artist i and 
artitl days 
in Barbizon 



It is a peculiar spot to look for great 
achievements, — a tiny hamlet of a 
single street, bounded on the one 
side by the forest of Fontainebleau and on the other 
by a broad plain. And yet, as we are again in- 
formed, there gathered about an inn, table in this 
hamlet the largest group of men of creative power 
with the brush that have ever assembled anywhere 
since the Renaissance. In " Barbizon Days " 
(A. Wessels Co.), Mr. Charles Sprague Smith has 
pictured again the lives of Millet, Corot, Rousseau, 
and Barye, and the glad and sane " vie de Boheme " 
these men led in those early days — when each new- 
comer had to smoke Diaz's pipe, and when if the 
color of the smoke were iridescent he was declared 
a colorist, if gray a classicist. Here Millet found 
the work given him to do. " Its fruits were rugged, 



harsh to the taste of his generation. He might 
have drawn, from shallower soil, that which pleased. 
But his simple peasant nature, close in its qualities 
to the homely, industrious, fruit-bearing earth, akin 
in its tenacity of purpose to the firm-rooted oaks 
of his beloved forest, refused and refused again, 
and turned back to work and suffer." The author 
aims obviously at the fluent, desultory, imaginative 
style of Vernon Lee ; yet in his apparent emulation 
of this author's highly brilliant essays his metaphors 
ring true, — for he has absorbed the atmosphere of 
the locality under discussion. Whether describing 
Rousseau's personal struggle with nature, or the poet- 
ical legends and summer idyls of Corot, or the aca- 
demic sculpture of Barye, suggestive of the gorges 
of Apremont and Franchard, the author speaks with 
an air of authority. It is true that a more critical 
mind would cope with the facts more suggestively, 
deducing from them new aspects, new interrela- 
tions, new philosophical truths ; but to the average 
art-lover Mr. Smith's interpretations will broaden 
and deepen the simple power of appreciation and 
enjoyment. To-day, the good "vie de Boheme" 
has vanished from Barbizon ; the forest of Fon- 
tainebleau has been transformed, its solitudes have 
been made accessible, and thus, to the artist, pro- 
faned, — for the hamlet has been bound to the 
great world, not merely by broad carriage roads 
displacing a footpath across the forest, but even 
by a railroad that passes Rousseau's and Barye's 
cottages and Millet's atelier. The many half-tone 
illustrations enhance the charm of Mr. Smith's text. 



Love-letters of 



Before she found happiness in the 
M^gar* Fuller, love ^ of the Marquis Ossoli, rumor 

has it that Margaret Fuller's heart 
was twice deeply wounded by men unworthy of the 
confidence she so generously placed in them. The 
second of these tender episodes is now made public 
in the "Love-Letters of Margaret Fuller" (Apple- 
ton). The dainty little volume is not for profane 
eyes. In one of the later letters, Margaret herself 
wrote, " I want the mysterious tie that binds us to 
remain unprofaned forever"; and the sympathetic 
reader must feel, with all his enjoyment of the book, 
a sort of guilty regret at having suffered himself to 
become, in a way, an accessory after the fact (of 
publication). James Nathan, a German Jew, a 
commission merchant, a man of no education com- 
pared with Margaret's, captivated her fancy, and 
for the better part of two years she luxuriated and 
agonized in the raptures and spasms of what seemed 
to her an elective affinity. But the Jew went abroad, 
a few months before she herself sailed for Europe, 
and there he seems to have married. At any rate, 
his innamorata learned his unworthiness, and with 
wonderful fortitude calmly turned over that leaf in 
her troubled life, and pasted it down. Only a woman 
of like ardor and tenderness, and with experience of 
a like disillusionment, can read Margaret Fuller's 
heart-utterances with full sympathy and apprecia- 
tion. Painfully introspective and overloaded with

psychological analysis these outpourings certainly 
are ; hut the final impression is of a beautiful and 
confiding nature that has suffered cruelly. The 
frontispiece portrait, highly idealized and bearing 
no physical resemblance to its subject, well matches 
the ethereal beauty of these letters addressed to a 
lover who, as conceived by his correspondent, had 
no earthly existence. The fact that, after her death, 
he offered her letters for sale to a publisher, may 
serve as an index to his real character. The letters 
were at that time — or so the story goes — restored 
intact to the Fuller family by the publisher, greatly 
to his honor. The cream of the volume, to many 
readers, will be Mrs. Howe's introduction and the 
reprinted reminiscences of Emerson, Greeley, and 
Charles T. Congdon. 

It is a difficult thing to write of spir- 

f/hUto SPring * itual f orce8 in the making of history. 
This task, the Rev. Joseph B. Clark, 
Secretary of the Congregational Home Missionary 
Society, has attempted in his volume entitled 
" Leavening the Nation " (The Baker & Taylor 
Co.), in which he gives an account of the spread 
of churches throughout the United States. This 
church growth originated in the efforts of separate 
Home Missonary Societies in the East, which united 
in national organizations early in the nineteenth cen- 
tury. The first chapter of the book indicates the 
early habits of thinking and living that led to the 
first society in 1798. The larger part of the vol- 
ume is taken up with the story of the growth of 
churches accompanying the great pioneer move- 
ments that have attended the settling of the country 
in the Northwest Territory, the Louisiana Purchase, 
Oregon, the Mexican Cession, the Southern belt, 
and the present-day invasions of Alaska, Cuba, and 
Porto Rico. The implication of the title, as well as 
the purpose of the author, is to give due credit to 
the missions of the leading religious denominations ; 
but except for the interesting summaries of present 
religious conditions in each State, the story is prac- 
tically untold except for the Congregational denom- 
ination to which Dr. Clark belongs. Even for one 
denomination, the history can only be given in out- 
line in such a volume ; but even in its abbreviated 
form, one is surprised at the record of heroic cour- 
age and endurance, the marshalling of honored 
names, and the close relation of these self-sacrificing 
missionaries and their work to the development of 
the country. One feels that here, even with the diffi- 
culty of estimating the true value of such efforts, a 
glimpse is had of the deepest motives, and of the 
underlying facts that explain our measure of civili- 
zation. The Home Missionary effort in the North- 
west and in the Louisiana Purchase is not given with 
the spirit which marks the account of missionary pro- 
gress in Oregon, California, and Oklahoma. This 
seems due to the fact that the author did not delve 
into the records of the earlier years, so abundantly 
at his hand, sufficiently to reproduce the spirit of 
those days of giving and doing, surely as stirring 



then as the spirit which to-day fills Porto Rico with 
schools and churches. Dr. Clark does not close 
without paying tribute to the part women have 
taken in this work, or without vindicating New En- 
gland from the charge of " decadence." He admits 
the danger from the foreign population in New En- 
gland, and the lessened number of the old Puritan 
stock in the hill churches, but contends that the 
remedy is at hand and is effective in the application 
of Home Missions to the very region where they 
originated. This remedy he thinks also effective 
for the problem of the congested foreign popula- 
tions in our large cities. This, however, is the field 
of the prophet rather than of the historian. 

That humor is impossible to the man 
wuandwtdom. 80 economical of his mental processes 

that he " runs only one train of 
thought a day," will be readily admitted. The Rev. 
Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers, as he stands at once 
disguised and revealed in " The Gentle Reader " 
(Houghton), is evidently not such a man. Whether, 
with a New-England regard for the Sabbath pro- 
prieties, his intellectual time-table schedules but one 
train for Sunday, is a query that may arise; but 
those who have heard him in the pulpit will hardly 
believe his mental railway less travelled on the first 
day of the week than on the following six. Readers 
of the " Atlantic " do not need to have their atten- 
tion called to the Gentle Reader's bright, humorous, 
thoughtful, and thought-provoking reflections on 
sundry themes, chiefly literary. They will, however, 
be glad to possess, in book form, these delightfully 
readable essays, and will judge them not unworthy 
of a place beside the genial disquisitions of the 
Autocrat. In lightness of touch, playfulness of 
fancy, and a certain pleasing addiction to the para- 
doxical, the two authors are not unlike. A knack 
of happy characterization is conspicuous in Dr. 
Crothers. Alluding to the fondness of the quasi- 
logical mind for arguing in a circle, he aptly styles 
this diversion "an intellectual merry-go-round." Cer- 
tain other minds, not of the first order, are spoken 
of as prone to indulge in an equally exhilarating 
career through space, — "the toboggan slide of 
alliteration." The painfully accurate historian's 
obtrusive footnotes are conceived of as running 
along at the bottom of the page " like little angry 
dogs barking at the text." It is such sprightly 
touches as these that tickle the reader's fancy and 
keep him ever alert and expectant. 

Mr. W. D. Ellwanger's book on "The 
i*£5J£. Oriental Rug " (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 

traverses somewhat the same field as 
Mr. Mumford's monumental work, but is much 
slighter, and is written more from the point of view 
of the connoisseur and collector. The author's ap- 
preciation of the intrinsic beauty and artistic value 
of fine rugs and carpets is keen and intelligent. It 
may, however, be doubted whether he has altogether 
succeeded in imparting that point of view to the 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



361 



general reader. The task, indeed, is an impossible 
one. For those whose eyes are trained to see, there 
is in Mr. Ellwanger's volume mnch useful informa- 
tion about the qualities and characteristics of the 
different weaves. There is also some practical 
advice to the collector, both as to the choosing and 
the care of his treasures. The chief difficulty in 
utilizing such counsel, aside from the inherent one 
of inability to supply the fineness of perception that 
makes all qualities good and bad almost instantly 
visible, is that the really fine specimens of the 
oriental rug weavers' art are distinctly individual. 
Their value as works of art (which they indubitably 
are) depends not upon the weave, — that is to say, 
upon the locality whence they come, but upon such 
qualities as coloring, texture, fineness, condition, and 
beauty of design. Books, therefore, can serve only 
in a very limited and imperfect way as guides. The 
one way in which they can be of real help is through 
their illustrations. Those which embellish the vol- 
ume under consideration leave nothing to be asked 
for except that there should be more of them. With 
one exception, they reproduce rare specimens from 
the collections of the author and of Mr. George H. 
Ellwanger. So beautiful are they, that the lover 
of such things, especially if he happens to be a poor 
man, cannot escape a pang of regret that the pref- 
erence of the mass of mankind for what is crude, 
garish, and vulgar, alone prevents works of equal 
merit from being generally produced to-day instead 
of the inferior wares with which the bazaars are filled. 

The Old Testament ranks of Ger- 
Babei and Bible, many have been mysteriously stirred 

up by a lecture delivered in Berlin 
in January, 1902. Professor Friedrich Delitzsch, 
the well-known Assyriologist, was the author of the 
lecture. Its suddenly acquired popularity was due 
not so much to its contents as to the fact that it was 
delivered in the presence of his Majesty, the Kaiser. 
The lecture dealt with the Bible and its new light 
from the mounds of Babylonia. Professor Delitzsch 
presented the matter in a dramatic manner, and, as 
was to be expected, magnified very greatly the sub- 
stantial gains made through the marvellous revela- 
tions of excavators in the Orient and decipherers 
at home. Such stupendous statements were chal- 
lenged within a year by a score of brochures written 
by university professors and scholarly pastors in 
Germany. In January of the present year the same 
scholar delivered a second lecture in the presence 
of the Kaiser and the German Oriental Society. 
These two lectures, abundantly illustrated, have 
been translated by Mr. C. H. W. Johns of Cam- 
bridge, and published as Volume I. of the " Crown 
Theological Library" with the title "Babel and 
Bible" (Putnam). Of the 255 pages, 93 are 
" Notes," controversial, literary, and archaeological. 
They reveal some of the unpleasantnesses which 
exist between rival schools and scholars in Ger- 
many. The immense mass of literature on this 
theme that has appeared in Germany within one 



year and a half has not disturbed the equilibrium 
of American and English scholars. It is a Ger- 
man quarrel over things not new, nor things said 
for the first time. Imperial countenance gave im- 
petus and provoked challenges, and the fight was 
on. Mr. Johns has given us a good translation, so 
that American and English readers, who care to 
know why German scholars have been wrangling 
over " Babel and Bible " and how Professor 
Delitzsch handles them, now have the opportunity 
to read up the case. 

The inexpensive pocket editions of 
Noble Author*. standard authors, so predominant 

now in the booksellers' windows, 
have their own especial virtues and advantages 
which no one may gainsay. But the idea is some- 
what overdone, and we are glad to note the appear- 
ance of at least one new series that will make its 
appeal to those whose delight it is, in Hazlitt's 
phrase, to "browse on folios." From all such book- 
lovers of an older fashion, the " Chiswick Library 
of Noble Authors," undertaken by the Scott-Thaw 
Co., deserves cordial greeting. To present a few 
noble books in noble form, embodying the very 
highest ideals in modern bookmaking, is the object 
of the series. Appropriate commencement is made 
with Landor's " Pericles and Aspasia," reprinted 
without new editorial matter from the text of 1876, 
and issued in an edition limited to two hundred 
copies. The volume is of folio size, imposing in 
appearance, yet light and easily handled. The text 
is printed on Arnold handmade paper, from a per- 
fectly simple but distinctive cut of old style pica 
type, with marginal running-heads and chapter- 
titles in red. Beyond a frontispiece portrait of 
Landor, a designed title-page, and floriated chapter- 
initials, there is nothing of decoration in the volume. 
Its marked distinction of appearance rests upon a 
basis of irreproachable typography and presswork. 
In these details the Chiswick Press, around which 
centre the highest traditions of more than a cen- 
tury of English printing, has fairly surpassed its 
own best efforts, — which is saying a great deal. 
The little company of book-lovers into whose hands 
this limited edition may come should count it 
among their choicest treasures. 

Ntm-medieinai The 8eries of five volumes entitled 
therapeutic " A System of Physiologic Thera- 

procedure*. peutics," edited by Dr. S. S. Cohen 

and published by Messrs. Blakiston, is in effect an 
exposition of the current views of medical men on 
various non-medicinal therapeutic procedures. It 
includes a wide range of subjects of interest to the 
ordinary reader, and is a proper and valuable con- 
tribution to general education. It is a series which 
is adapted to the public library and to the libraries 
of colleges and high schools, and contains informa- 
tion which might be called for in almost any library. 
Like all composite series, different chapters are of 
different scientific and literary value, but nearly all 



362 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16» 



of them can be read with advantage by the average 
reader. It is a series devoid of repulsive illustra- 
tions, and it is filled with maps, diagrams, and 
pictures, illustrative of the very extensive subjects 
covered. One can hardly consult a work of this 
kind without finding defects and deficiencies, and 
we would only call attention to the extensive treat- 
ment of the life-history of some of the more re- 
cently discovered parasites, and the very brief way 
in which some of the more common and better 
known are passed over. For example, no mention 
is made of the number of eggs which the female 
bedbug deposits in her lifetime, or the period of 
incubation required for each egg ; nor is there men- 
tion of the time required for an adult and fertile 
bedbug to be developed from the egg. Little is 
said in regard to the methods of destroying this 
pest, and such directions as are given are inefficient 
and inexact. In only a few households does the 
life-history of the malarial germ or the tsetse fly 
become a matter of vital importance ; but the sta- 
bility and permanency of many a family hangs 
upon the successful understanding of the life and 
death of the bedbug. 



The latest 
Egyptian 
History. 



Dr. E. A. W. Budge, author of the 
latest "History of Egypt" (Henry 
Frowde), has certain admirable qual- 
ifications for his task, — some familiarity with 
Egyptian texts, an immense mass of material at his 
disposal in the British Museum, a painstaking dili- 
gence in the collection of authorities, and in general 
a clear way of putting things in English speech. 
But he lacks some indispensable requirements for 
success, — such as accurate knowledge of the Egyp- 
tian language, critical ability, and a sense for his- 
torical development. The result is that in these 
eight volumes the student has an unequalled survey 
of the latest results of excavation, good and useful 
pictures, some valuable discussions of minor points, 
but no ordered presentation of events or critical 
estimate of the sources of knowledge, and so erratic 
a handling of Egyptian texts as to make the use of 
his results by a layman quite unsafe. Of course it 
follows that the work is very far from being the 
ideal history of Egypt, although it is an agreeable 
and interesting account of things Egyptian, and 
gotten up in admirable style by the Oxford Univer- 
sity Press. 

To architects and students of archi- 
iSSL tvei. tecture the name of C. R. Cockerell 

is probably somewhat familiar, 
though thirty years have passed since his death. 
His son, Mr. Samuel Pepys Cockerell, now edits 
his journal of " Travels in Southern Europe and 
the Levant, 1810-1817" (Longmans). The re- 
mains of the temple of Jupiter Panhellenius in 
^Egina were discovered by him and his party, and 
also the bas-reliefs forming the frieze of the temple 
of Apollo Epicurius near the ancient Phigaleia in 
Arcadia. The reliefs are now in the British Mu- 



seum ; the iEgina marbles were unfortunately lost 
to England, being purchased by Crown Prince Louis 
of Bavaria. Beside Greece, Cockerell travelled in 
Crete, Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy, exploring ruins 
and sketching them, and also noting peculiarities of 
the places and people visited. An attractive ex- 
terior, a high spirit, a dauntless courage, and ap- 
parently an ample supply of ready money, did him 
good service wherever he went; and he bad need 
enough of boldness and energy in exploring Greece 
in those days of Turkish misrule and violence. It 
is these occasional incidents of peril and of daring 
adventure that make some pages of the book very 
readable ; but its literary charm is slight, and its 
archaeological information has been largely super- 
seded by works of later origin. The editor admits 
that the young traveller disliked and had no talent 
for writing. The products of his pencil excelled 
those of his pen ; but of the former we have no 
specimen. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A subscription edition of " The Novels and Stories of 
Ivan Turgenieff," newly translated from the Russian 
by Miss Isabel F. Hapgood, is one of the most impor- 
tant among the enterprises of the Messrs. Scribner for 
the present season. The volumes are to be fifteen in 
number, each with a photogravure frontispiece and a 
special introduction by the translator, while no less a 
critic than Mr. Henry James has contributed a general 
introduction to the edition. Of the four volumes al- 
ready issued two contain the " Memoirs of a Sports- 
man," the third gives us "Rudin " and " A King Lear 
of the Steppes," and the fourth," A Nobleman's Nest." 
Four more volumes will suffice for the novels proper, 
leaving no less than seven for the short stories and 
sketches. A complete translation of these minor mas- 
terpieces has long been desired, and we are happy to 
note that it is at last forthcoming. 

" Webster's Collegiate Dictionary," published by the 
G. & C. Merriam Co., is an abridgment of the " Inter- 
national," but an abridgment that contains enough 
matter to be really worth while. Condensation has 
been practised at every possible point, and the use of 
thin paper still further reduces the dimensions of the 
volume, which contains over eleven hundred pages, 
although it is of only moderate thickness. The work 
is indexed, and includes the most important of the 
supplementary collections of words and phrases. The 
copy on our desk is bound in limp seal, and is altogether 
both attractive in appearance and a marvel of judicious 
editing. 

Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. publish an edition, in a 
single volume, of " The Complete Works of Edmund 
Spenser," with an introduction by Professor Trent, and 
a life of the poet by Mr. J. W. McSpadden. The word 
M complete " is to be taken literally, for the volume 
includes " A View of the Present State of Ireland " as 
well as all the poems. Although there are over nine 
hundred pages, the print is perforce inconveniently 
small, and anything but tempting to the reader. But 
the whole of Spenser in a single volume is worth having, 
for reasons of space-economy, if for no others. An 
etched portrait serves as a frontispiece.

" Representative Men " and " English Traits " have 
been added by Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. to their 
" Centenary " edition of Emerson. The notes to both 
volumes are extensive, and place this edition in a class

Professor Friedrich Kauffmann's litttle book on 
" Deutsche Mythologie," translated as " Northern My-

The booklet is attractively illustrated. 

Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. publish a small "Antigone " 
volume, being an account of last year's performance of 
the tragedy at the Stanford University. The booklet 
contains many pictures, a bill of the play, and three

A four-volume set of " Don Quixote," in Ormsby's

James Fitzmaurice Kelly, comes to us from Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co. The text is absolutely unabridged, 
and there are illustrations — one to a volume. 

Dr. Henry van Dyke's " Joy and Power," printed 
at the Merrymount Press for the Messrs. Crowell, con- 
tains three occasional addresses which may be described

The" Epistolse Ho-Elianae" in three volumes, Brown-

One of the most useful and instructive of the sea- 
son's books for younger readers will be the two-volume 
work on " Famous Battles of the Nineteenth Century," 
written by various well-known authors and edited by 
Mr. Charles Welsh, an authority on juvenile literature. 

" Phcenixiana " is now nearly half a century old, but

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons publish a series of 
¥ Little French Masterpieces," edited by Mr. Alexander 
Jessup, and translated by Mr. George Burnham Ives. 
Four volumes are at band, illustrating Me'rime'e, Flau-

are neatly bound in flexible leather. 

Mr. Rudyard Kipling's " Just So Stories " and his 
new volume of poems, " The Five Nations," are added 
by the Messrs. Scribner to the " Outward Bound " edi- 
tion of his writings, while " The Five Nations " appears 
simultaneously in less sumptuous form from the press 
of Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

Book collectors will be interested to know that 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. are issuing a limited 
large paper edition of Fiske's " Dutch and Quaker 
Colonies " in its illustrated form. " Ponkapog Papers " 
by Mr. T. B. Aldricb also appears in a small uncut edi-

"The Little Tea Book" and "Over the Black 
Coffee " are two compilations, made by Mr. Arthur 
Gray, and comprising verses, anecdotes, and other mat- 
ters of interest to devotees of the respective beverages. 
These books come in novel and suggestive cases, and 
are published by the Baker & Taylor Co. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. announce a de luxe 
holiday edition of " The Leopard's Spots," by Thomas 
Dixon, Jr., printed from new plates on large paper. 
It will contain illustrations not included in the regular 
edition, and the binding will be in white and gold of 
special design, protected by a case. 

The Macmillan Co. will publish this month an impor- 
tant and timely volume on " The Opening of the Mis- 
sissippi," by Mr. Frederic Austin Ogg, Instructor in 
History in the University of Indiana. The author is 
said to have made a thorough study of his subject, bring- 
ing together much exceedingly interesting material. 

" The Structure of the Glands of Brunner," by Pro- 
fessor Robert Russell Bensley, and " The Battle of 
Kadesh," by Professor James Henry Breasted, are two 
monographs that have nothing in common save their 
scholarly character, and the fact that both are included 
in the decennial publications of the University of Chicago. 
The twentieth edition of " Switzerland," and the 
twelfth of " Norway, Sweden, and Denmark," are the 
latest Baedekers to be sent us by the Messrs. Scribner, 
who import these best of all guide-books for the Ameri- 
can market. These manuals are so well known that 
they need no description, and praise would be super- 
fluous. 

"The Geography of Commerce," by Professor Spen- 
cer Trotter, is a text-book for secondary schools having 
commercial courses. It belongs to the " Commercial 
Series " of the Messrs. Macmillan, prepared under the 
general supervision of Dr. C. A. Herrick. The illustra- 
tions are numerous, and the suggested exercises of a 
practically helpful sort. Altogether, it is a book to be 
praised. 

Two publications of an artistic nature to be brought 
out by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. during the present 
month are likely to be much in demand as the holiday 
season approaches. One of these is " The Boy Calen- 
dar," comprising enlarged reproductions of twelve of 
Mr. J. T. McCutcheon's well-known " boy " cartoons, 



printed on separate sheets in the form of a wall calen- 
dar. The other is Miss Hazel Martyn's " A Portfolio 
of Sketches," which includes a striking series of ten 
facsimile reproductions in red and black of heads of 
women. 

The Messrs. Appleton are the publishers of an 
" author's edition," limited to one thousand sets, of 
the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. " The White 
Company " and " The Hound of the Baskervilles," the 
two volumes first published, are handsome productions 
of the bookmaker's art, and leave no doubt in our mind 
that the set is one well deserving of a place on the 
library shelf. 

Mr. Lorado Taft's " History of American Sculpture " 
will be the first volume to appear in Professor Van 
Dyke's projected series on " The History of American 
Art," to be issued by the Macmillan Co. This series 
will bring together for the first time materials for a 
complete history of art in this country. Each volume 
begins with the founding of the nation and carries the 
record down to the present year. 

A new novel by Mrs. Humphry Ward has been se- 
cured by " Harper's Magazine " for serial publication 
during the coming year, to commence immediately on 
the conclusion of Miss Mary Johnston's romance, " Sir 
Mortimer." The same magazine is also fortunate in 
being able to retain the exclusive services during 1904 
of the two foremost American illustrators, Messrs. 
Edwin A. Abbey and Howard Pyle. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the publishers of a twelve 
weeks' college course in " Mechanics, Molecular Physics, 
and Heat," by Professor Robert Andrews Millikan. 
From the same publishers we have also a revised 
edition of Professor C. A. Young's " Lessons in Astron- 
omy," and a thin bound volume containing all the 
questions set last June by the College Entrance Exami- 
nation Board, with the names of examiners and readers 
in each department. 

The labor of preparing and putting through the press 
of Mrs. Wheelock's handbook on " The Birds of Cali- 
fornia," has compelled the publishers, Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co., to postpone the publication of the book 
until January of the coming year. The work treats of 
some three hundred birds found in California and the 
adjacent islands, and with its profuse illustrations by 
Mr. Bruce Horsfall will no doubt form an indispensable 
hand-book for bird lovers generally and tourists in 
California specifically.

"In Lord Kelvin's Address to the British Association the following passage occurs: 'If a probable solution con- 
sistent with the ordinary course of nature can be found, we must not invoke an abnormal act of Creative Power.' 
The anthor has endeavored to conform strictly to this principle. Darwin's theory of a natural selection has been 
accepted in every case as far as appeared adequate to accounting fairly for the phenomena ; an additional cause has 
only been proposed where that theory appeared inadequate or inapplicable." — Author's Preface.

STELLA FREGELIUS. A Tale of Three Destinies. 

By H. Rider Haggard, author of "Jess." "The Pearl Maiden." etc. 12mo. Cloth, ornamental. $1 50. 

"The main idea of this new story by one of the most darinsr inventors of the modern tale of adventure is a novel one, and the enlist- 
ment of the services of science in a search for a knowledge of the hereafter, the employment of an instrument for the transmission of one 
of the earthly senses in the opening up of communication with the spirit world. . . . The invention which serves him in these pages is 
that of a wireless telephone which is to call back the departed across the chasm. . . . Mr. Haggard has written a story that is much 
of a novelty from him, and, truth to tell, it is far more interesting than would be another tale of Jerusalem or South African wonders 
from his pen." — Mail and JExprett, New York.

" An interesting novel in which love, music, and human weak- 
ness and the waywardness of woman are strangely and cleverly 
blended. Each chapter is headed with a bar of music and the 
entire story is keyed to respond to the musical theme. Dramatic 
and absorbing." — Pittsburgh ChronicU-Telegraph.

the paintings of Mr. Sargent, particularly \ sargfj 
of his portraits, of which there are fifty-four. The

a sufficient area for the rendering of much of the 
technical as well as the general artistic excellence of the 
originals. The selection includes many pieces of portraiture 
celebrated in this country as well as in England, copies of

full descriptions, and an infallible system of discovering the exact date of any piece of old 
silver, as well as determining its genuineness. Its treatment of hall-marks is at once simple and 
complete ; the table can be used successfully by anyone. There is a chapter on noted silversmiths, 
with their portraits. The devices of the unscrupulous dealer are fully entered into, with a descrip- 
tion of the methods of forging plate. The illustrations are numerous and elaborate, including 
six artotypes printed in silver and gold.

MR. GIBSON'S new book is much more attractive than usual, not only 
because of the larger number of cartoons than usual, but, in par- 
ticular, of the greatly increased popularity and the telling character 
of his latest work. The keynote is found in the question mark cunningly 
suggested by the clever drawing accompanying the title phrase. Are 
women really "the weaker sex"? Most of the drawings have a humorous 
bearing on this all-important question, and all of them show the piquancy, 
deft characterization, and rare execution that have made Mr. Gibson's great 
and growing popular success.

Senator GEORGE F. HOAR'S 

AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
of SEVENTY YEARS 

NOT only for its political importance, but for the unusual personal, 
social and literary interest of the reminiscences it brings together, 
Senator Hoar's autobiography will be the most notable contribution 
of the year to memoir literature. It would be impossible to find 
another man in the country who has known more of the important 
men and measures of his time than Mr. Hoar ; and the charm and 
piquancy of his style, with its range, from the eloquent discussion of 
his political principles to the humor of his anecdotes, are as remarkable 
as his experiences. The book is refreshingly frank and full of char- 
acter and individuality — a record of opinions as well as events.

Mors et Victoria 

A DRAMA IN THREE ACTS 

Printed at the Merrymount Press, with a specially designed binding. 
8vo, gilt top. $1.20 net. By mail, $1.25. 

"An anonymous drama of more than poetic skill and power . . . both as a drama and a poem, worthy 
of the serious attention and praise of critics. The details are not the work of a novice and the verse is of 
unusual strength. As a work of both force and finish ' Mors et Victoria' is not likely to be forgotten." 

— Courier-Journal, Louisville. 

"... The tale that he or she unfolds — and unfolds in capital literary fashion — is of the Duke of Guise, 
Vallon de Vallonbois, and Marguerite of Navarre. The blank verse is stately and rich in poetic feeling. . . ,*' 

— Dramatic Mirror. 

"... It is brief, but it is eloquent of the courage and power of love. . . . The love interviews of Vallon, 
the Huguenot, and Marguerite de Bonne-Grace are quite charming. She, though no Huguenot, is a lover, 
and at the end is strong enough to die with Vallon in the barn where Guise's ruffians in arms break in upon 
the Huguenots at their evening psalm. The author's name is not given, but a woman who could write this 
can write larger things." — Republican, Springfield. 

"... 'Yes, I have read, during the week,' said I, 'one poem really worth while — a very beautiful 
dramatic poem called " Mors et Victoria." There is no author's name on the title-page, and I don't know 
who wrote it, but whoever did, certainly need not be ashamed of it.' . . ." 

— Literary World (Editors' Club), Boston. 

"... Picturesque and full of fine character drawing, and we do not see why it could not be presented 
before the footlights with success. It resembles the old stock plays in which our fathers delighted, and that 
were not intended for a day but for all time. It is written in smoothly vigorous blank verse; its plot is full 
of interest, and the play throughout shows literary culture and a study of the best dramatic models." — Beacon.

THE BARTLETT CALENDARS FOR 1904 




The Canterbury Calendar 

Designed by T. M. Cleland, is a departure from 
the ordinary forms of decorative calendars and is 
sure to delight the heart of the lover of beautiful 
things. It depicts three stages in the journey of the 
Canterbury pilgrims, in triptych form, with one 
large central panel and a smaller one hinged at 
either side. In the left-hand picture is shown the 
start from the inn at South wark ; in the centre, the 
journey through the woods ; and on the right the 
arrival at the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket. It is 
drawn in the quaint style of the early English wood- 
cuts and a tapestry- like effect is produced by the use 
of dull shades of red, green, blue, brown, and gold. 
Size 12x15 inches. Price $1.00

Twelve prayers by Robert Louis 
Stevenson, including the much- 
praised "Morning Prayer" and

type, with initials rubricated, on 12 
sheets Japan paper, with decorative 
designs by Mr. Herbert Gregson.

point, and for its delicate sentiment, one of the most beautiful and 
appropriate offerings for the year's beginning." — The Church Review.

ON LETTER-WRITERS AND LETTER- 
WRITING. 

" Solitude is sweet," says a French writer, 
" but I desire a friend to whom I can say solitude 
is sweet." The best letters, the letters that 
speak to the heart and soul, have been written 
by those whose loneliness left them no other 
adequate means of self-expression, and who, 
writing to their friends with no thought of pro- 
ducing literature, have put into what they wrote 
so much of their inmost and truest selves that 
their letters could not fail to live and breathe, 
whether or not they enjoyed the distinction, not 
always an enviable one, of being published to 
the world to whom they were not addressed. 
Thousands of the best letters must have escaped 
this fate, their very excellence as personal mes- 
sages putting their publication out of the ques- 



408 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



tion. But of those that have been offered to the 
general reader, the most eloquent and touching 
are from the pens of writers solitary in their 
nature and habits. Eugenie de Guerin, in the 
country, poured out her soul to her beloved 
Maurice in Paris ; and after his death she still 
wrote to him in her journal, " to Maurice in 
heaven." This intimate communion was a 
necessity of her being and of her situation, and 
it was only natural that the brother's death 
should be followed before very many years by 
her own. Cowper, another solitary, wrote 
letters that will live as long as John Gilpin 
remains a familiar figure. That most delight- 
ful recluse, Edward FitzGerald, put the best 
of himself into his letters. Although Charles 
Lamb was a convivial soul, may it not have 
been the essential loneliness of his unmarried 
life, as well as the pathos of bis relation to his 
afflicted sister, that gave his letters their inim- 
itable quality ? No man can spend himself in 
an unlimited variety of ways ; but self-utterance 
•of some sort he must and will find, or die. Thus, 
when a rich and generous nature is denied the 
(bestowal of its treasures in other directions, its 
letters are sure to have warmth and life. 

That this is not a letter-writing age may be 
true. But readable letters are still written, 
and occasionally get into print. A little volume 
of excellent ones has recently appeared, in a 
privately-issued edition. They are by Edward 
Chipman Guild. The name will indicate) the 
writer's good New England ancestry. With 
the blood of the Guilds there mingled in his 
veins that of the Quincys, the Fly nts, the Eliots, 
and the Dudleys, all of whom took root in our 
soil within twenty years of the Mayflower's 
arrival. His conception of the well-written 
letter is the true one. It is a " miniature work 
of art." 

" It has its just and due proportions, like a poem, a 
picture or a statue; it has its beginning, middle and 
end, like a little drama, and it must not be patched and 
seamed, it must not be spun out; when the natural and 
fitting end has come, the < vale ' must be spoken and the 
sheet folded and the envelope closed; if there is more 
to be said it must be put into another letter, tho' it be 
written the same day." 

Most letters, as Mr. Guild admits with regret, 
are mere sketches or memoranda, and convey 
no impression of warm, spontaneous outburst 
and overflow of the writer's personality. Our 
correspondents are too often circumspect and 
self-conscious ; they do not write as they talk ; 
they no sooner put pen to paper than unreality 
stamps itself on every word they utter. Doctor 
Johnson long ago declared that letters should 



have " an even flow of unlaboured diction, and 
an artless arrangement of obvious sentiments." 
One may query, parenthetically, whether such 
a thing as unlabored diction is possible to the 
writer of pure Johnsonese. Channing wrote to 
one of his numerous correspondents, in apology 
for supposed defects in his letters : 

" I cannot start a subject without clinging to it, and 
I am very apt to run it down. The excellence of letter- 
writing, as of conversation, is thought to consist in a 
free and rather desultory movement of mind, in easy 
transitions and graceful allusions, in flitting from sub- 
ject to subject, and in sportively connecting remote 
topics by means of light and delicate resemblances." 

He regrets his lack of the " lighter graces," and 
regards the ability to make oneself agreeable 
as not the least effectual means of being useful. 
This self-estimate is, of course, to be taken with 
modifications. 

The letter-writing mood comes not every day ; 
in fact, for long seasons, the heavenly fire may 
refuse to descend, and without inspiration a 
letter is as dead as the implements with which 
it is written. Sterne felt this when, excusing 
his tardiness in answering a correspondent, he 
said: 

" It is not every hour, or day, or week of a man's life 
that is a fit season for the duties of Friendship. Senti- 
ment is not always at hand ; pride and folly, and what 
is called business, of ten-times keep it at a distance; and 
without sentiment what is Friendship? — a name! a 
shadow!" 

Just here is suggested another characteristic 
of good letter-writing. Although Cowper calls 
friendly correspondence " talking upon paper," 
it has, with all its points of inferiority, some 
points of superiority to conversation. It admits 
of a fulness and warmth of personal expression, 
a certain depth of sincerity, that would be 
frightened away by the sound of the voice. The 
sentiment regarded by Sterne as so essential to 
friendship gains a more deliberate utterance. 
It is true, sentiment may degenerate into sen- 
timentality, as came very near being the case 
in an amusing letter written to his wife by a 
certain Lord Ogilvie, a Scotchman, about the 
middle of the eighteenth century. " I aske par- 
don," he begins, 

M for troubleing you when I have nothing to say that's 
worth your while heareing from the Port of Cambray, 
where I could not get into last night. I have no other 
design by sending you this Billet but to make me think 
and dream over your Charms, with which I am Ass 
enough to be intoxicate, and for to pray you to write 
me every day, and to appoint when I shall come back." 

This excellent man was probably better with 
his tongue than with his pen. Not less strong 
than the impulse to write when the mood is on 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



409 



is the impatience to have the letter off one's 
hands as soon as written. Something like the 
thwarted feeling of the stammerer takes hold 
of us at finding in our pocket the letter we 
had intended to mail yesterday. We began to 
speak, but could not get the words fairly out. 
Every good letter- writer has a lively interest 
in what he writes, and he imagines his corre- 
spondent's interest will abate with his own if 
the letter is withheld. So he hastens to de- 
spatch it, exclaiming with St. Paul, " See how 
large a letter I have written with mine own 
hand!" 

Another advantage of the written over the 
spoken communication is that we are less often 
troubled with vain regrets at lost opportunities 
to say a bright thing, or with self-reproach for 
having said a stupid one. Dull wits, and nim- 
ble wits too, keep pace more easily with the pen 
than with the tongue. The writer has time to 
put his thought into the best possible form, 
and to embroider it with all the suggestions 
of a playful fancy. " Trifles " — to quote Dr. 
Johnson once more — " always require exuber- 
ance of ornament ; the building which has no 
strength can be valued only for the grace of its 
decorations. The pebble must be polished with 
care, which hopes to be valued as a diamond." 
Our friend Guild would heartily subscribe to 
this. He says : 

" I like to use a great many words and to say a great 
deal more than is necessary to convey my meaning. I 
do not say anything which I do not really mean. But 
I like to put my meaning in a vivid and striking way, — 
to expatiate upon my feelings; it may not be the best 
way, but it happens to be my way, and it is not a bad 
way; only what I say is not to be read with a micro- 
scope." 

The essential thing, then, is that the letter- 
writer should take a lively interest in his own 
life, however uneventful, and impart this in- 
terest to his reader. Little things are usually 
more significant than big. The best letter- 
writers have led lives devoid, outwardly, of 
stirring incidents. It is the inner life that 
signifies. Eugenie de Guerin had nothing but 
the unfolding of her soul to chronicle for her 
brother's reading ; but that was enough. Can 
anything exceed in interest the pulsing thought 
of a human brain, the throbbing emotions of a 
human heart? In letters we seem to get nearer 
to the writer's intimate self than in any other 
form of literature, unless it be now and then 
in lyric poetry. The good letter excels both in 
the skill with which its writer handles his me- 
dium of expression and in the self-revelation 
which so arrests the reader's attention that he 



loses sight of that medium and seems to stand 
face to face with the writer. Without con- 
scious effort the fine qualities of a perfect style 
escape notice, which is occupied with the thing 
told, and not with the manner of its telling. 

A word now in defense of the good old 
fashion of making a graceful exit at the end 
of one's letter. The letter that comes to so 
sudden a stop as to hurl the reader forward onto 
his nose leaves a less happy final impression 
than the one that ends less abruptly. To be 
at once suave and sincere in one's parting com- 
pliments is the thing to aim at. Suavity un- 
doubtedly predominated in the courtly endings 
of eighteenth-century letters. But honesty and 
elegance were sometimes combined. It is a 
never-failing delight to read that famous let- 
ter, proud at once and reproachful, from Dr. 
Johnson to Lord Chesterfield. Boswell praised 
it as a literary masterpiece. Its conclusion is 
so happily worded as to excuse its reproduction 
here, familiar though it must be to most readers. 

" Having carried on my work thus far with so little 
obligation to any favorer of learning, I shall not be dis- 
appointed though I shall conclude it, if less be possible, 
with less; for I have been long wakened from that 
dream of hope, in which I once boasted myself with so 
much exultation. 

" My Lord, your lordship's most humble, 

" Most obedient servant, 

"Sam. Johnson." 
Another neatly-turned ending is found in that 
pithy and pungent communication from Frank- 
lin to his old friend Strahan in London, on the 
outbreak of our Revolution, — 

" You have begun to burn our towns, and murder 
our people. Look upon your hands! They are stained 
with the blood of your relations! You and I were long 
friends; you are now my enemy, and I am 

" Yours, 

« B. Franklin." 
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu took commend- 
able pains not to conclude her letters so ab- 
ruptly as to jar her correspondents. Note in 
the following how cleverly she at once excuses 
and avoids precipitation. At the end of a letter 
dealing largely with the Babel of tongues heard 
by her in Constantinople, she writes : 

" As I prefer English to all the rest, I am extremely 
mortified at the daily decay of it in my head, where 
I '11 assure you (with grief of heart) it is reduced to 
such a small number of words I can not recollect any 
tolerable phrase to conclude my letter with, and am 
forced to tell your ladyship, very bluntly, that I am, 
yours, etc." 

The artificiality here is too manifest and inten- 
tional and innocent to give offense. Not all 
of us know so well how and when to lift pen 
from paper. Percy F. Bicknell.

MORLET'8 LiIFE OF GLADSTONE.* 

In commenting on the difficulties of his task 
in writing a life of Gladstone, Mr. Morley 
acknowledges that he has found it wholly im- 
possible to treat in detail more than the polit- 
ical aspect of the career of one who was for 
over a half a century an important, and often 
a central figure, in wider English life. For 
Gladstone was a theologian and churchman as 
well as a statesman. 

" He cared as much for the church as he cared for 
the state; he thought of the church as the soul of the 
state; he believed the attainment by the magistrate of 
the ends of government to depend upon religion; and 
he was sure that the strength of a state corresponds to 
the religious strength and soundness of the community 
of which the state is a civil organ." 

This duality of interests (though Gladstone 
would not have recognized it as such) consti- 
tutes the main problem of presentation which 
Mr. Morley has striven to meet — the problem 
of analyzing the political principles and actions 
of Gladstone, without permitting the essential 
spirituality of the man to be lost sight of in the 
maze of party struggles. His method of meet- 
ing it constitutes the distinctive feature of his 
work, and at the same time serves to make his 
three large volumes a genuine biographical 
characterization rather than a mere history of 
contemporary politics. For to-day men are 
interested most in what Gladstone was, not in 
what he did, and in the present work the inter- 
est is in Mr. Morley's estimate of the man, 
rather than in his resume of the man's activities. 
Having excluded from his labor more than 
a superficial notice in passing, of Gladstone's 
religious and doctrinal writings, Mr. Morley's 
method of still impressing upon his reader 
this side of his hero's character, is to show 
by quotation from Gladstone's diary or let- 
ters, and by frequent repetitions of statement, 
the constant presence of religious sentiment 
and conviction in all political acts. Thus while 
yet a student at Oxford, Gladstone writes 
in his diary (December 29, 1831), "May God 
use me as a vessel for his own purposes, of 
whatever character and results in relation to 
myself," and was in truth very nearly convinced 
that his own best future lay in service as a min- 
ister of the church. A year later, when but

twenty-three, unexpected opportunity brought 
him a seat in parliament, and of his own in- 
tense interest in the campaign preceding the 
election, he tells himself. 

"I wish that I could hope my frame of mind had 
been in any degree removed from earth and brought 
nearer to heaven, that the habit of my mind had been 
imbued with something of that spirit which is not of 
this world." 

At first, indeed, politics seemed to him to be 
endangering his spiritual life, for after a brief 
experience of parliament he notes: 

" Twenty-four years have I lived. . . . Where is the 
continuous work which ought to fill up the life of a Chris- 
tian without intermission ? . . . I have been growing, 
that is certain; in good or evil? Much fluctuation; 
after a supposed progress, terminating in finding myself 
at, or short of, the point which I deemed I had left 
behind me. Business and political excitement a tre- 
mendous trial, not so much alleviating as forcibly drag- 
ging down the soul from that temper which is fit to 
inhale the air of heaven." 

Intensity of religious feeling, then, was a vital 
necessity to Gladstone, both in his early career 
and always. He looked for direct divine aid 
and inspiration in every act of his political life. 
"Spoke 30 to 35 minutes on University bill, with 
more ease than I had hoped, having been more mindful, 
or less unmindful of Divine aid." (July 11, 1834.) 
" Spoke on the Irish church — under forty minutes. I 
cannot help here recording that this matter of speaking 
is really my strongest religious exercise. On all occa- 
sions, and to-day especially, was forced upon me the 
humiliating sense of my inability to exercise my reason 
in the face of the H. of C, and of the necessity of my 
utterly failing, unless God gave me the strength and 
language. It was after all a poor performance, but 
would have been poorer had He never been in my 
thoughts as a present and powerful aid" (May 30, 1835). 

This confidence in divine aid naturally rested on 
the conviction that in each case the cause to be 
plead was in itself just and righteous, and in- 
tensity of religious conviction, whatever else 
may be said of it, was an unquestionable source 
of strength in the energy with which he sought 
to give life to his political ideals. Well has 
Mr. Morley said of him : 

" All his activities were in his own mind one. This, 
we can hardly repeat too often, is the fundamental fact 
of Mr. Gladstone's history. Political life was only part 
of his religious life. It was religion that prompted his 
literary life. It was religious motive that, through a 
thousand avenues and channels, stirred him and guided 
him in his whole conception of active social duty." 

And this was as true of his later as of his 
earlier years, for in 1868, on his birthday, the 
day on which each year he seems to strike a 
balance of his activities and progress, he notes : 
* This birthday opens my sixtieth year. I descend 
the hill of life. It would be a truer figure to say I 
ascend a steepening path with a burden of ever gath-

ering weight. The Almighty seems to sustain and spare 
me for some purpose of His own, deeply unworthy as I 
know myself to be. Glory be to His name." 

Postulating, then, this one great central char- 
acteristic, Mr. Morley further furnishes a de- 
tailed analysis of various elements constituting 
Gladstone's personality. Briefly stated, these 
were : bodily strength, permitting the full play 
of a magnificent intellect ; strength of will and 
definiteness of purpose ; political courage, not 
merely to stand by his political opinions under 
censure, but to venture on new and untried 
ground in the full confidence that his ideas 
would soon meet acceptance even if at first in- 
volving political disaster ; a real human inter- 
est in his fellow men (a quality which Mr. 
Morley asserts, though acknowledging that he 
is expressing a disputed opinion) ; impetuosity, 
controlled by a sense of his own shortcomings 
and by prayer ; genuine oratory, both natural 
and studied, and for the first thirty years of 
his career customarily exercised in parliament, 
where mere words without logic and conviction 
could not have prevailed ; hatred of injustice, 
tempered in action by the knowledge that evil 
conditions must wait their remedy until the 
time is ripe ; too great a readiness to believe in 
the sincerity of others; steady attraction to 
the practical and feasible, rather than the ideal, 
in legislation; unchangeable mental attitude 
toward religious dogma ; lack of comprehen- 
sion in things metaphysical and abstract ; per- 
sonal good manners and courtesy; and, finally, 
a deep religious feeling of responsibility for 
his talents, without any trace of purely per- 
sonal ambition. The qualities thus grouped by 
Mr. Morley are in the main those which, at 
various times and by different writers, have 
been separately ascribed to Gladstone, saving 
only that of the dominating religious element, 
which Mr. Morley is the first to prove con- 
clusively. But there remains the question of 
consistency, which Gladstone's opponents have 
always denied to him, drawing a line between 
sincerity and consistency. These argue that 
while perfectly sincere in each crisis of his 
career, and in each political act, Gladstone was 
frequently wholly inconsistent, and moreover 
that he always refused to recognize his own 
face-about on vital questions. In other words, 
that while he was sincere in believing himself 
consistent, this was a distinct failing in his char- 
acter, though a real strength in political life. 
Of this Mr. Morley has little to say, and by 
his silence gives some ground for the accusa- 
tion itself. Gladstone's speeches abounded in 



conditional clauses, which frequently permitted* 
him to escape from the consequences of his- 
own logic, and which, unnoticed by parliamen- 
tary opponents in the heat of debate, often 
tripped up those opponents who sought to pin- 
Gladstone down to an admission of inconsisr- 
tency. These very conditional clauses, how- 
ever, Mr. Morley considers as evidence, not of 
a fear of exact statement, but of a certain slow- 
ness of grasp, combined with a desire to be 
fair, which he represents as characteristic ofc 
Gladstone's political evolution. For Mr. Mor- 
ley does not deny that Gladstone changed 
materially in political sentiment from time to 
time, terming him a "wonderful pilgrim" on 
a "shining progress," and Gladstone himself 
in an autobiographical fragment, never printed,. 
but here frequently quoted by the author, seems 
to look with something like wonder on his ear- 
liest political conceptions. 

Any estimate of the character of Gladstone 
as shown in his political acts, inevitably in- 
volves at least an indirect comparison with 
those leaders of opposing parties, who were 
contemporaneous. There were many such, but 
in public opinion no one occupied the position 
of an essential rival, in the same way as did 
Disraeli. Both made their first impression 
upon parliament as members of the Tory party, 
though very early owning allegiance to oppo- 
site wings of that party after the split which 
followed the repeal of the corn laws. For 
fully ten years after this event Gladstone felt 
himself a Tory, and it is evident from Mr. 
Morley's resume that he long considered the 
possibility of a reunion of the party under 
Derby. One great obstacle was Disraeli,, 
whose leadership in the Commons would have- 
been personally distasteful to Gladstone, and- 
whose integrity Gladstone could never bring 
himself to believe in. Added to natural po- 
litical opposition, there was evidently in each 
a total inability to appreciate the other's ideals 
and character. A real though veiled personal 
dislike accentuated the issues between them, 
and it is interesting, if not wholly instructive, 
to note the few instances in which Gladstone is. 
here permitted to state his impressions of his 
great rival. Writing to his wife in 1850 of a 
debate in the Commons he says : 

" Disraeli showed the marvellous talent that he has 
for summing up with brilliancy, buoyancy, and com- 
prehensiveness, at the close of a debate. You have 
heard me speak of that talent before when I have been 
wholly against him ; but never, last night or any other 
time, would I go to him for conviction, but for the de- 
light of the ear and the fancy."

THE DIAL 



[Dee. 1, 



In 1852, in a letter to Lord Aberdeen refer- 
ring to the acts of the Tory party under 
Derby, on the questions of protection and re- 
ligious liberty, Gladstone is more direct in 
accusation. 

" The shifting and shuffling that I complain of have 
'been due partly to a miserably false position and the 
giddy prominence of inferior men ; partly to the (surely 
.not unexpected) unscrupulousness and second motives 
• of Mr. Disraeli, at once the necessity of Lord Derby 
.and the curse." 

Mr. Morley is himself too much of the Glad- 
Etonian type to be able to appreciate to the 
tfull the real constructive genius of Disraeli, 
"fantastic in form and expression though it 
frequently was. To Mr. Morley, as to Glad- 
stone, the trifling of Disraeli on serious topics 
appears an unforgiveable sin, and he asserts 
.that such trifling "though it may divert a 
Hater generation to whose legislative bills it 
■can do no harm, helps to explain the deep dis- 
favor with which Disraeli was regarded by his 
•severe and strenuous opponent." That Dis- 
raeli had political genius of a high order, 
Mr. Morley freely admits, as when Disraeli 
appreciated, earlier than any other man, the 
development of a great national interest in 
British empire and in social questions. 

" This coming mood the Tory leader, with his rare 
faculty of wide and sweeping forecast, confidently di- 
vined, and he found for it the oracle of a party cry in 
phrases about Empire and Social Reform. When power 
fell into his hands he made no single move of solid 
effect for either social reform or imperial unity. When 
Mr. Gladstone committed himself to a policy, he brought 
in bills to carry it out. Forecast without bills is in- 
teresting, but not to be trusted." 

This is the customary judgment of English 
liberals in comparing the two men. Gladstone 
is lauded for his actual and practical legisla- 
tion, and Disraeli belittled for his lack of it. 
But, in fact, sufficient time has not yet passed 
to permit any sure judgment. Immediate pos- 
terity may regard exact and constructive acts 
of legislation as the basis of a statesman's claim 
to fame, but if the reputation of men famous 
at a more remote period of history is any cri- 
terion, it is rather upon a genius and ability 
for constructive principles, not specific acts, 
that a true claim to fame rests. 

In a career so full of incident as that of 
Gladstone's, it is wholly impossible to select 
any two or three events of superior importance, 
and it is not intended therefore to specify here 
any such for particular notice. Home rule 
naturally occupies a large part of Mr. Morley 's 
attention in his third volume, but the discussion 
given to it is far too intricate to permit brief 



analysis, though it may be noted, in passing, 
that Gladstone is energetically defended against 
the charge of a sudden face-about and surren- 
der to Parnell in 1886. But there is one inci- 
dent that will be of great interest to students 
of American history. Gladstone, as is well 
known, was a sympathizer, though in no sense 
a partisan, of the South in the Civil War. In 
this connection Mr. Morley says: 

" Of this immense conflict Mr. Gladstone, like most 
of the leading statesmen of the time, and like the 
majority of his countrymen, failed to take the true 
measure. The error that lay at the root of our En- 
glish misconception of the American struggle is now 
clear. We applied ordinary political maxims to what 
was not merely a political contest, but a social revolu- 
tion. Without scrutiny of the cardinal realities be- 
neath, we discussed it like some superficial conflict in 
our old world about boundaries, successions, territorial 
partitions, dynastic preponderance." 

Viewing the struggle in this light, and much 
more interested at the moment in Italian than in 
American affairs, Gladstone failed to see any 
moral issue at stake. Many Englishmen had 
no interest in the American conflict save as it 
affected commercial and industrial conditions 
at home, and it was in this way that the con- 
flict appealed to Gladstone. Mr. Morley shows 
us, it is true, that Gladstone argued in Cabinet 
against the first sharp note drawn up by Pal- 
merston in regard to the Trent affair, and that 
presumably he also urged his objections to the 
Queen and to the Prince Consort. The infer- 
ence is that these objections were of influence 
in producing those suggestions from the Queen 
which modified Palmerston's note, but the basis 
of Gladstone's objections was not in any sym- 
pathy with this country; it was that "I could 
not feel sure that we were at the bottom of the 
law of the case, or could judge here and now 
what form it would assume." Gladstone was 
in fact anxious to have his government inter- 
fere in some way and put an end to the conflict, 
while the only feasible end, in his mind, was 
the separation of North and South. In 1862 
Palmerston wrote to him that a movement was 
on foot by which England, France, and Russia 
were to offer mediation to the contending par- 
ties, and that if both North and South accepted 
this, an armistice would follow and negotia- 
tions on the basis of separation ; while if both 
declined, the mediating powers would acknowl- 
edge the independence of the South. Glad- 
stone was heartily in favor of this plan, but 
curiously enough was himself largely respon- 
sible for thwarting it. He was at Newcastle at 
the time, and in a speech evidently premature 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



413 



and unconsidered, he practically disclosed what 
he believed to be the determination of the Cabi- 
net. 

" We know quite well that the people of the Northern 
States have not yet drank of the cup — they are still 
trying to hold it far from their lips — which all the 
rest of the world see they nevertheless must drink of. 
We may have our own opinions about slavery; we may 
be for or against the South; but there is no doubt that 
Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the South have 
made an army; they are making, it appears, a navy; 
and they have made what is more than either, they 
have made a nation." 

Gladstone quickly found himself in difficul- 
ties both with the public and with his fellow- 
ministers. Russell wrote to him : 

". . . You mast allow me to say that I think you went 
beyond the latitude which all speakers must be allowed, 
when you said that Jeff. Davis had made a nation. 
Recognition would seem to follow, and for that step I 
think the cabinet is not prepared. However, we shall 
soon meet to discuss this very topic." 

Very naturally Gladstone was now urged both 
by conviction and by pride to press for an 
offer of mediation, and became most energetic 
in this object. The question came to an issue 
in the Cabinet in November of 1862, when the 
English government was forced to answer a 
suggestion from France that a joint offer of 
mediation be made. Russia had already de- 
clined. Gladstone writes home at this time : 
"Nov. 11. We have had our cabinet today and meet 
again tomorrow. I am afraid that we shall do little or 
nothing in the business of America. But I will send 
you definite intelligence. Both Lords Palmerston and 
Russell are right. — Nov. 12. The United States affair 
has ended and not well. Lord Russell rather turned 
tail. He gave way without resolutely fighting out his 
battle. However, though we decline for the moment, 
the answer is put upon grounds and in terms which 
leave the matter very open for the future." 

Of the various causes which brought about this 
change in Cabinet opinion, the tempest aroused 
by Gladstone's Newcastle speech was by far the 
greatest. In his later career Gladstone often 
freely confessed his great error of judgment in 
regard to the then existing political situation 
in America, and professed also an error of 
sympathy in the struggle itself. 

These comments on some few characteristics 
of Mr. Morley's work do not adequately repre- 
sent either the magnitude of the work itself 
or the ability of the author. It is certainly not 
over-praise to say that no other such thorough, 
scholarly, and interesting biography has ap- 
peared in recent years. Mr. Morley is without 
question gifted in biographical writing, as his 
life of Cobden, issued in 1881, abundantly 
proved; but even this earlier notable work, 
when compared in point of style, method of 



treatment, and historical insight, with the 
present work, seems weak and insufficient. 
Mr. Morley has put his best into this Life of 
Gladstone. His fitness for the task was pre- 
eminent, both from an evident sympathy with 
and belief in Gladstone himself, and from an 
intimate personal acquaintance in Gladstone's 
later life — an acquaintance which has per- 
mitted the inclusion in the work of many re- 
ports of delightful conversations on literary and 
other non-political topics. It is true that too 
great sympathy is in danger of becoming ex- 
treme bias, and so may render a biographer 
unfit rather than fit for his work. Mr. Mor- 
ley's own explanation on this point best repre- 
sents his conception of his duty. 

" That my book should be a biography without a trace 
of bias, no reader will expect. There is at least no 
bias against the truth; but indifferent neutrality in a 
work produced, as this is, in the spirit of loyal and 
affectionate remembrance, would be distasteful, discord- 
ant, and impossible. I should be heartily sorry if there 
were no signs of partiality and no evidence of prepos- 
session. On the other band there is, I trust, no importu- 
nate advocacy or tedious assentation." 

For the reasons here indicated it is perfectly 
possible that some of Mr. Morley's historical 
interpretations, particularly in the later period, 
may be attacked on grounds of accuracy. But 
considering the political and social relations of 
the two men, it is difficult to see how the biog- 
rapher's task could have been approached, or 
concluded, in a fairer spirit. e # d. Adams. 



A Book-IjOvkr's Small-Talk.* 



Some two years ago Mr. Adrian H. Joline 
entertained us with " The Meditations of an 
Autograph Collector," and the reception ac- 
corded that volume has occasioned the writing 
of another in a similar vein. In " The Diver- 
sions of a Book-Lover " anyone of a bookish 
nature will find small-talk to suit his idiosyn- 
crasy. And when a " deep and winsome " man 
invites you to his fireside of an evening, there 
to listen to a conversation that is at once collo- 
quial and confessional, character is apt to be 
shown in and through the lines spoken. 

The title of Mr. Joline's new book appears 
at first misleading, because it leads us to expect 
therein the ravings of a bibliomaniac, or the 
adventures of a book-collector in unearthing 
historic treasures. But the present author 
does not confine himself to the " royal family

of books," nor to that field so long occupied by 
the pedantic Thomas Frognall Dibdin — long 
rest his tedious chronicles ! — of Roxburghe 
Club fame. 

a I address myself to people with a fairly good educa- 
tion, conscious of an affection for books, who have a 
secret, bashful fondness, often afraid to confess it, for 
the fruitless, nugatory and unprofitable; who like to 
browse aimlessly in libraries without the presence of a 
censor; who love a book merely because it is a book, 
the octavo or duodecimo expression of somebody's ideas, 
no matter how trifling or how feebly unimportant those 
ideas may be." 

He aims to attract by felicitous selection, not 
by elaborate exhaustiveness ; but we may add 
that his "Diversions" are not characterized 
by what Mr. Richard Burton terms " stylistic 
distinction." We hope we have Mr. Joline's 
sanction in assuming that criticism should con- 
cern itself not only with the thing said, but also 
with the author's way of saying it. Still, he 
somewhat disarms criticism by his remarks on 
the subject of book-reviews. 

" Laying aside those which are palpably advertise- 
ments in the guise of criticism, one will find the reviewer 
in ecstacies over that which his fellow-reviewer feels 
obliged to treat with contempt or severity. It has never 
been otherwise in the history of literature. Reduced 
to a truism, it is all a matter of taste. ... It is quite 
likely that some solemn person may say my remarks are 
lacking in good taste; which, correctly defined, is what 
some people think that every one else ought to think. 
. . . Mr. Zangwill says of some of his utterances that 
they are « egoistic' ' To be egoistic,' he tells us, ' is not 
to be egotistic. Egoism should be distinguished from 
egotism. The egoist offers his thought to his fellow 
men, the egotist thinks it is the only thought worth their 
acceptance.' I plead guilty to the most pronounced 
egoism. It is wholly immaterial to me whether any 
one accepts my thoughts. If I am right, it is not my 
fault, but the reader's misfortune if he refuses to accept 
them; if I am wrong it is better for all that they should 
not be accepted." 

There is a tradition in a college town that a 
professor was once questioned at an evening 
party as to the meaning of a word in Byzantine 
Greek. Turning to his questioner he slowly 
asked : " Madam, is this for information or for 
conversation ? " And this is precisely the 
inquiry we are sometimes inclined to put to 
Mr. Joline. 

Speaking of American humor, the author 
points out that if anyone cares to encounter 
a real Yankee, he is more likely to find him 
in Lowell's " Biglow Papers," or the pages 
of "Artemus Ward," than in the works of 
"Major Jack Downing" or "Sam Slick" 
(Haliburton), — the latter of whom he calls a 
pseudo-humorist of the callow age of American 
literature. We cannot agree with him entirely 



when he would have us accept as truth the 
assertion that, as a nation, we are dangerously 
near to being decadent in humor ; though we, 
likewise, question the dubious fun of our pro- 
fessional comic papers and the jocosity of 
American dailies. 

" There are sundry illusions, cherished for generations, 
regarding certain nations and races. The roast beef of 
old England may long ago have been worthy of glori- 
fication in song and story, but in modern times it is 
usually transported from Chicago across the ocean, and 
it is by no means as good as English mutton. The 
politeness of the Frenchman is a delusive shadow of a 
vanished past, as one who has been rudely thrust into 
a Parisian gutter by a swaggering officer in soiled uni- 
form is ready to attest. The Swedes seem to have 
taken to themselves the famous French courtesy when 
they borrowed Bernadotte in order to place the marshal 
of Napoleon upon the throne of Gustavus Adolphus. 
The corpulent German, with his huge pipe, his towering 
stein of beer, and his elongated dachshund, I have en- 
countered more frequently in the many-colored pages 
of ' Puck ' and ' Judge ' than in the domains of the 
War- Lord. Is the celebrated American humor another 
departed dream? " 

In further proof he would have us dissect the 
stories in our Sunday newspapers — " no such 
awful examples of vulgarity, such dilapidated 
relics of bygone times, such puerile specimens 
of playful idiocy, could ever be palmed off 
successfully upon a people capable of appre- 
ciating true and original wit." Let the right- 
eousness of his indignation be the excuse for 
his vituperation ! 

Touching upon dramatic literature, et cetera, 
we are reminded that play-goers of this genera- 
tion would stare in dissatisfied astonishment at 
the plays and players of forty years ago — as 
the luxurious Roman who sat in bored silence 
through the Heauton-Timoroumenos of the 
popular Publius Terentius Afer may have 
regretted " The Frogs " of Aristophanes. 

" Our revered fathers used to shake their heads even 
at Wallack and thought that all the dramatic perform- 
ances of the sixties were degenerate. So we have with 
us even now the praisers of past times who sneer at 
Ternina, and Nordica, and Melba, and tell us how much 
better Jenny Lind was, and how infinitely superior the 
piping tones of Mario were to the manly notes of Jean 
de Reszke. We gray-bearded devotees of reminiscence 
easily recall the alleged wickedness of a certain play 
called ' The Black Crook,' wherein the loveliness of the 
female form divine was displayed in a liberal, gorgeous 
and spectacular fashion; but when we compare it with 
the present day productions of burlesques and operettas, 
the light artillery of the drama, the old show seems 
almost Diana-like in its modesty. Whither are we 
tending? When I dream of what may come three 
decades hence I am inclined to hide myself in the re- 
tired precints of the Century Club and blush furiously. 
It is all a matter of custom, but I cannot help feeling 
a sense of sorrow at the decline of good taste when I

put in parallel columns the coarse and common crudi- 
ties of Weber and Fields and the sweet dignity of the 
plays which used to fill the old Wallack Theater with 
crowds of cultured people. Yet I go to Weber and 
Fields, and I laugh at their ridiculous antics, while at 
home I sigh over the decline of the theater and mourn 
over the departed glories of the legitimate drama." 

There is always a piquancy to those remarks 
in which a writer is visibly striving to discover 
why he is magnetically attracted by what his 
intellect condemns. 

We are compelled to state that the chapter 
entitled " Of American Novelists and of Robert 
Louis Stevenson, with Some Remarks about 
Criticism " strikes us as hardly adequate to the 
theme. After reading it one is apt to say, as 
Carlyle said after reading Hegel, that one has 
often enough been over this road before, but 
never with a chain and ball at one's ankle. 
Now and then Mr. Joline indulges in a quiet 
little pasquinade at the expense of writers of 
history ; still, accuracy in history, according to 
Mr. Andrew Lang, is a fond delusion — the 
historian is merely a prosy pedant or a decora- 
tive falsifier. The chapter on " Gas-logs and 
the Private Library " forces one to the conclu- 
sion that, after all, cosmopolitan New York is 
to be regarded as more favorable to gracefully 
witty small-talk than the air of the London 
drawing-room or the thinner and more crystal- 
line atmosphere of the Paris salon. 

In speaking of novels and literary asso- 
ciation, the author quotes a story of George 
Augustus Sala to the effect that a worthy citi- 
zen of Edinburgh, who settled his quarterly 
accounts with unfailing punctuality, always de- 
ducted fifteen per cent on the ground that he 
had been intimate with Sir Walter Scott. The 
vast majority of the readers of the present 
generation occupy themselves principally with 
what are called "novels" — or "history that 
didn't happen," as they are styled by that 
admirable historian, John Richard Green. 
*' These sweets," says Mr. Joline, "have always 
appealed to the palate of mankind from the 
days of Boccaccio and of Marguerite de Na- 
varre to those of Hall Caine and Sir Gilbert 
Parker. I do not wish to be understood as 
giving to Boccaccio the title of first of the 
novelists or to Parker the distinction of being 
the last of them, although the lively M.P. has 
apparently acquired a right of way to the seats 
of the mighty." Quod bene notandum I 

We have touched upon a small portion only 
of these chatty " Diversions." Their author 
has the faculty — a faculty curiously rare — of

would be a trifle more interesting if a little less 
iconoclastic. Chapters on books, authors, fine 
bindings, and curious editions are interwoven 
with anecdotes and stories in the narrative, and 
all go to make up a volume which every book- 
lover must find entertaining and in some degree 
instructive. Ingram A. Pyle. 



The New Orthodoxy.* 



The publishers advertise Dr. Gordon's book 
on " Ultimate Conceptions of Faith " as " a 
comprehensive statement of the working the- 
ology of one of the foremost representatives of 
the liberal orthodoxy of today." Dr. Gordon 
is minister of the Old South Church, Boston, 
and a leading exponent of the opinions of the 
more radical wing of the Congregational de- 
nomination. He frankly recognizes the down- 
fall of the old orthodoxy in the minds of 
thoughtful people, and the utter impossibility 
of reconciling some of the ancient dogmas with 
modern science, or even with modern morality 
or common-sense. So far from deploring all 
this, he rejoices in it, and believes it necessary 
for the purification of religion. When we were 
required to accept the Bible, word for word, 
as the inspired work of God, we were justly 
exposed to the ridicule and contempt of the 
enemies of religion. What a strange mixture 
of truth and fiction, of good morals and sav- 
agery, had we adopted! What heroes and 
heroines of those ancient days demanded our 
reverence ! Only our colossal stupidity could 
excuse us, — we knew no better. 

Yet, after all, we did know a little better 
than that. Forgetting the logical outcome of 
our professed creed, we did instinctively seek 
out the good and hold by it. The attitude of 
the Roman Catholic Church toward the Bible 
is in itself a recognition of the absurdity of 
the situation ; the writings are infallible, but 
you must not take them at their face-value, 
they must be interpreted : — of course. But 
now it is different. The new faith sees in the 
Bible the hand of God, interpreted by the 
mind of man. Recognizing the alloy, the gen- 
uineness of the gold is the more apparent. We 
have the story of a great nation illuminated 
by spiritual insight ; it is for us to discern the 
thread of precious metal woven into its sub- 
stance. It does not matter what history may 
now reveal; the thing is proof of itself. A

scbool-boy is reputed to have said that "the 
works of Homer were not written by Homer, 
but by another man of the same name." It is 
all the same ; and if you can prove that Jesus 
Christ or William Shakespeare did not exist, 
there are the gospels and the plays. 

As the Bible is proof of its own validity as 
a source of light, so in mankind is found the 
true testimony to the existence of God. The 
subjective workings of the human mind result 
in the formation of ideals, and when these are 
believed in, we have the beginning of the idea 
of God. As understood by us, God is the per- 
sonification of our best ideal. That he is more 
than this, Dr. Gordon frankly recognizes, for 
the human mind has its limitations, the great- 
ness of which modern science daily emphasizes. 
The argument here presented has an exact 
parallel on the objective side. The things we 
see and feel are believed by us to have genuine 
reality, although in fact we know only that we 
experience certain sensations. Moreover, we 
are assured that the facts thus demonstrated to 
us are not all the facts ; there are vast realms 
of objective reality concerning which we have 
no sensations, and never can have any, as we 
are at present organized. There is a common 
saying: "One man, with God, is a majority." 
The true believer in the validity and reality of 
his ideal will die for it, and his death is not a 
defeat, but a triumph. So it was with Jesus 
Christ ; through shameful death came glorious 
victory ; — a sufficient reason in itself for the 
event, — a demonstration for all the ages of 
the supreme worth of things spiritual. 

Against all this it may be said that the truly 
modest and wise man is he who does not thus 
glorify the image he has made, not with his 
hands, but with his mind. If he is thoughtful, 
he must know that it is imperfect, and that 
others are wiser than himself. Should he not 
therefore, submit to guidance ; get his religion 
second-hand, as it were? It is a plausible ar- 
gument, but it breaks down if, as religious peo- 
ple in all ages have believed, there is a better 
source of spiritual power in communion be- 
tween the individual and his God. Just as the 
modern scientist goes first to nature, and only 
to books when nature is not available, so the 
religious man may seek his insight from God, 
nor be ashamed of so doing. To a materialist, 
this will doubtless seem absurd ; but it is nev- 
ertheless an objective fact of history that the 
great men who have moved the world to better 
things have above all things been believers in 
the reality of the ideal. 



Perhaps the greatest advance of the new 
orthodoxy (if here it be truly orthodox) is in 
its conception of Jesus. According to Dr. 
Gordon, he is but returning to the old ortho- 
doxy, for he says (p. 292) : 

" The preexistence of Jesus I do not find in the 
teaching of the great theologians, with the exception 
of Origen, and he teaches the preexistence of all soul. 
It is not Jesus who preexists before his advent; it is 
the Logos, the Christ, the eternal Son who preexists." 

In other words, we have in Jesus the vehicle 
of the Word, the perfectly transparent window 
of Heaven, through which the spirit of God 
shines with undimished brilliance. But as it 
seems to me, there is here no radical difference 
from the rest of humanity; it is a matter of 
degree rather than of kind. Many men have 
shown spiritual insight in preeminent degrees, 
all probably have it in some degree ; but Jesus 
was the perfect jewel without a flaw. Even 
this last opinion may well need amendment, 
for after all, is not such perfection inconsistent 
with human nature, and is not the story of the 
temptation a demonstration of the fact that 
Jesus had to struggle with his own baser ele- 
ments like the rest of us ? But here we are 
going beyond our author. 

Dr. Gordon supports the doctrine of the 
Trinity with the observation that God is neces- 
sarily parallel to humanity, and therefore must 
be a social being. 

" He is not an eternal egoist in eternal isolation " 
(p. 370). 

"The contest today is between God as an eternal 
egoist and God as an eternal socialist. If God is an 
eternal egoist He is the contradiction of humanity; 
and as history shows, the distance from deism to athe- 
ism, from an unmeaning God to no God at all, is short. 
If God is an eternal socialist, He is in himself the 
ground and hope of mankind " (p. 374). 

A species of polytheism (though the term 
would not be admitted) seems to be the out- 
come of the argument, only the plural God- 
head is in perfect harmony with itself, and by 
virtue of that fact a unit. Thus is the Trinity 
explained. 

The permanence of matter and energy, on 
the objective side, have become axiomatic in 
science. The conviction of the reality of our 
spiritual being leads us to the idea of immor- 
tality, which is as much a corner-stone of the 
new faith as it ever was of the old. Says Dr. 
Gordon (p. 167), the " reciprocity between 
God and man, whether in terms of love, as in 
the case of all the holy, or in terms of dis- 
cipline, as with all defiant souls, would appear 
to authenticate the immortality of man." And 
moreover, "death is one of the hardest facts 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

with which optimism has to deal. By itself it 
seems to me fatal. Death as a finality is the 
supreme sarcasm upon life" (p. 229). As 
Tennyson has it, — 

" Why should we bear with an hour of torture, a 
moment of pain, 
If every man die for ever, if all his griefs are in vain, 
And the homeless planet at length will be wheel'd 

thro' the silence of space, 
Motherless evermore of an ever- vanishing race, 
When the worm shall have writhed its last, and its 

last brother worm will have fled 
From the dead fossil skull that is left in the rocks 
of an earth that is dead? " 

For the rest, the book is full of interesting 
thoughts, though its literary form does not seem 
to me good. There is too much of the preacher's 
mannerism, which exhibits itself in the repe- 
tition of the same thing in innumerable dif- 
ferent ways. One is reminded a little of the 
sailor who boasted that he could swear for ten 
minutes without using the same word twice. 
On page 137, Dr. W. G. Ward is curiously 
referred to as " a Mr. Ward, a minor person 
in the Oxford movement."

Fox, and his Part m English Politics.* 

In the preface to his political study of 
Charles James Fox, Mr. Hammond discloses 
his attitude toward his subject in the state- 
ment that he " is one of the many readers in 
whom Sir George Trevelyan's Early Life of 
Charles James Fox excited a sentiment which 
it is perhaps not an exaggeration to describe 
as a personal affection for the great Whig 
statesman," and that the book " is an attempt 
to portray the great ideas that Fox stood for, 
to vindicate the essential consistency of his 
career, and to appreciate the magnanimous 
inspirations he gave to politics." He says fur- 
ther, after stating the great questions of the 
period : " These questions call for a minute 
treatment in a presentation of Fox as the 
champion, during the frenzied years of panic, 
of government by public discussion, and as one 
of the few Whigs who anticipated the great 
Liberal doctrine of national rights." This 
minute treatment he pursues through three 
hundred and fifty pages, devoting one or two 
chapters to each great aspect of the struggle 
against the policy of the king. 

It is unfortunate, from the point of view of 

•Charles James Fox. A Political Study. By J. L. 
LeB, Hammond. New York : James Pott & Co. 



a forcible presentation of the career of Fox, 
that the stage was occupied, during the greater 
part of the time included in this study, hy 
William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister,, 
while Fox was not only in opposition, but was 
hated by the king as no other statesman of the 
time was hated ; and that he had also, by his 
foolish coalition with North, forfeited a large* 
part of his influence with the people. Mr. 
Hammond, as a partisan of Fox, is less than 
fair to his great rival ; and the constant criti- 
cism and repeated denunciation of Pitt, and of 
nearly all that he did, weaken the otherwise 
able and convincing presentation of Fox's 
career. One should read with this some book 
like Lord Rosebery's life of Pitt, which gives 
another interpretation of the policy of the 
great minister. It may also be said that Mr. 
Hammond, writing for English students of 
their own history, assumes a knowledge of the 
details of the political history of the times that 
makes the book hard reading for any except 
special students. 

After an excellent preliminary chapter, in 
which the author gives a summary of Fox's 
life to 1782, setting forth briefly his youthful 
escapades, the recklessness and blunders that 
marred his career, and the fine qualities of the 
man, the relations of Fox to the king are dis- 
cussed in two chapters of forty pages. They 
include a description of the king's policy of 
personal government, and of the disgraceful 
methods that he used to gain his ends ; an 
account of the short-lived Rockingham min- 
istry of 1782, and the effective blows that it 
struck at the king's power ; and a discussion 
of the Coalition. Mr. Hammond labors val- 
iantly to show that Fox's motives were credit- 
able, even though he must condemn his judg- 
ment. But it takes more convincing special 
pleading than the author gives to make us will- 
ing to free Fox from blame for joining hands, 
without any justification on the ground of a 
national crisis, with the man against whom he 
had been thundering for years as the incarna- 
tion of all that was vicious in politics. Fox 
never regained the influence that he thus wan- 
tonly threw away. 

After two chapters on Parliamentary Re- 
form and The Reign of Terror, which seem to- 
have been written to show up Pitt, the pro- 
fessed reformer, as faithless to his principles, 
we have two on Fox and Ireland, giving the 
melancholy story of the years between the 
granting of parliamentary independence and 
the shameful purchase of the Union. The

chief actors in the first part are G rattan, 
Burke, and Fox, all devoted to the Irish 
cause. But with the advent of Pitt's govern- 
ment, relations became steadily worse, owing 
largely to the king's opposition to Ireland; 
suspicion and hatred followed quickly upon 
the burst of gratitude that accompanied the gift 
of independence, culminating in the terrible 
outrages of the Rebellion. Pitt cannot be 
cleared of blame for giving up so easily and so 
fully to the king's prejudices ; but Fox was 
also blameworthy in allowing party spirit to 
dominate him in his opposition to the Com- 
mercial Propositions of Pitt, a measure based 
on modern economic principles that Fox did 
not understand, thus joining interested mono- 
polists and manufacturers to thwart the en- 
lightened efforts of the great minister. Fox 
«lid indeed stand here for the spirit of freedom, 
as he did through all his career; but Pitt had 
almost insuperable difficulties to surmount, in 
the king whom he served, and in the absorbing 
questions connected with the French Revolu- 
tion and the wars with France. 

American readers will be especially inter- 
ested in the chapter on Colonies and Depen- 
dencies, for in it Fox is shown as dealing his 
strongest blows for freedom, in company with 
Burke and Chatham, against the policy of En- 
gland in her treatment of the American colo- 
«ifes. The shadow of the Coalition had not 
yet covered him, and, though his views of trade 
were those of his time, he was ahead of his 
time in seeing " that it should be the sovereign 
end of British statesmanship to empty the re- 
lationship between the colonies and the mother 
country of any notion that would do violence 
to the self-respect of the former." He knew 
that the cause of colonial freedom was the 
cause of English freedom. The same spirit 
he carried into his dealings with India; and 
hie made a noble struggle against the slave- 
trade, having the satisfaction in his last days 
of carrying into effect two acts that practically 
abolished it. 

The remaining chapters of the book take up 
Fox's relations to the French Revolution, in 
several chapters, showing him to have been a 
consistent advocate of the principle of the right 
of a nation to settle its own affairs. Burke 
opposed the Revolution with the utmost vio- 
lence, because he saw that in destroying the 
old order " the enthusiasts who were impro- 
vising a constitution were making a highway 
for a usurper." Fox saw that the old order 
was bad, that it was already broken, and that 



its ruin opened the way for the people to secure 
their rights. In advocating the right of France 
to decide for herself whether she would have a 
Bourbon to reign over her, and the right of 
every nation to settle its own internal prob- 
lems, he voiced one of the leading principles 
of the nineteenth century, during which this 
spirit of nationality has created two great na- 
tions and others have made desperate efforts 
to come into complete existence. 

An interesting account is given, in the last 
chapter, of the efforts that were made while 
Fox was in public life to mitigate the un- 
reasonable and unrighteous abuses which all 
suffered who were not in accord with the Estab- 
lished Church. In all these efforts, Fox helped 
vigorously as a consistent champion of tolera- 
tion and equality. Mr. Hammond closes with 
these words : " If he fought relentlessly against 
all the sophistries by which statesmen who dis- 
owned persecution still perpetuated the intol- 
erance of the dead, it was just because no 
statesman had combined so passionately as he 
respect for the rights of man with respect for 
the rights of reason."

Books about Dante.* 



A year or two ago, the Rev. Charles Allen 
Dinsmore published a pleasant little book on 
" The Teachings of Dante." It was a book 
neither original nor profound, and it made no 
pretence of being either the one or the other ; 
but it was marked by reverence for the poet, 
and by a deep sense of gratitude for his spir- 
itual guidance. It seemed to be the report of 
one who had just discovered Dante for himself, 
and was eager to share the new inspiration with 
his fellows. Its enthusiasm had a naive quality 
that disarmed criticism, and it was a book at 
once so honest and so earnest that its helpfulness 
might be allowed even by those whom long study 
and great love had caused to search the volume 
of the divine poet through and through. Its

chief interest to us was in its unconscious reve- 
lation of the broadening influence exerted by 
the sacred song to which both heaven and earth 
had set their hand upon a mind still struggling 
in the meshes of a narrow conception of reli- 
gion, and instinctively groping toward a wider 
range and a freer outlook. The author of that 
volume now shows us that his studies in Dante 
have been continued to some purpose, and that 
his desire to help others along the same shin- 
ing path has not slackened. Under the title 
of " Aids to the Study of Dante " he has 
brought together in a second volume a well- 
considered selection of such documentary and 
critical matter as the beginner will find most 
useful in his studies. In the category of docu- 
ment, we have such things as the accounts of 
Boccaccio, Bruni, and the two Villanis, the 
Letter to Can Grande, and excerpts from 
Aquinas. In the critical category, we have 
lengthy passages from the essays by Church 
and Lowell, and treatments of special topics by 
Professor Charles Eliot Norton, Mr. James 
Bryce, Mr. P. H. Wicksteed, Mr. Edmund 
G. Gardner, Herr Scartazzini, Signor Com- 
paretti, and others. The editor contributes 
notes, introductory paragraphs, and special 
chapters on Italian lyric before Dante and on 
the " Paradiso." There are also illustrations 
in the form of portraits and plans. In spite 
of the somewhat similar works of Symonds, 
Scartazzini, and Maria Rossetti, there was 
room for such a book as this, and we are glad 
to accord it a welcome. 

" Dante and his Time," by Dr. Karl Federn, 
is a work of far more serious scholarship than 
the one just mentioned. In its present form, 
the work is not a mere translation, but " a re- 
vised issue by the author himself in a foreign 
tongue of a work originally composed in his 
own." We are reminded of this fact by the 
English scholar, Mr. Arthur John Butler, who 
contributes an introduction to the volume. Dr. 
Federn takes for his text Carlyle's saying that 
u in Dante's poem ten silent Christian centuries 
have found a voice," and endeavors, in a series 
of chapters preliminary to the discussion of the 
poet himself, to analyze the deposit left by 
those centuries upon the minds of men in 
Dante's time. In order to understand Dante's 
thought, he tells us, 

" We must know the remarkable men of this re- 
markable time, one must know what occupied them, 
how they looked upon the world and lived in it, what 
were their aims and what ways they took to carry 
them out, what they thought and believed, learned and 
taught, what seemed of importance to them in their 



lives, what happened in their world, its movements, its 
great struggles, its petty interests." 

All these things, and many more, are con- 
cisely and clearly discussed in the section of 
Dr. Federn's work called " The Time," the 
larger half of the volume. The chapters deal 
with such subjects as the destruction of the 
ancient civilization, the political and moral 
ideals of the Middle Ages, the secular conflict 
between Church and State, the knowledge and 
literature of the time, and the special condi- 
tions surrounding a thirteenth century Flor- 
entine. All these matters are handled with 
unfailing interest, and with what wealth of 
illustration is possible within rather closely- 
restricted limits. Having thus prepared the 
way, the author comes to the second section of 
his book, which " follows Dante's path through 
that dim and distant world which to us is but 
half-illuminated — the path of his life, which 
is the road to his works." The following im- 
pressive passage marks the transition from 
the one section to the other : 

■ We shall find the same world through which until 
now we have walked in ever narrower circles, totally 
changed and altered in Dante's head. We shall find it 
arrayed as a wonderful, immense building; we shall en- 
ter a cathedral, the foundations of which are laid in the 
depths of hell, and reflect all the horrors of those wild 
and cruel times in the terrible judgment which the 
wrathful Deity of mediaeval Christendom deals. Then 
we shall mount on serene and lucid stairs, leading on, 
through penitence to purification, to a splendour of daz- 
zling light, such as never poet before or after him knew 
how to evoke in men's fancies, as painters may perhaps 
have dreamt but never known to paint. And in every 
part of this cathedral we shall encounter the men who 
lived in the world we have tried to describe, and from 
the howling yells deep below, through the slow, peni- 
tential chants of the stairs, np to the blessed choirs in 
the celestial space, there sounds one music of many- 
sounding harmonies, in which the voices of all speakers 
join — the terze rime of Dante." 

To interpret the work of Dante through the 
study of his life and environment is thus the 
task which the author has set himself, and 
which he has performed with sober and con- 
servative judgment, placing much stress upon 
the psychology of the poet as reflected in his 
writings. The central fact of Dante's inner life 
is one with that of Shakespeare's, a fact which 
Dr. Federn clearly perceives. By what process 
of spiritual change could the poet of u Romeo 
and Juliet" become the poet of " King Lear," 
and the poet of the " Vita Nuova " become the 
poet of the " Divine Comedy " ? As the author 
says, " a sea of events and strange destinies had 
to roll by " the poet before this revolution 
could be wrought. The problem of this trans- 



420 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



formation is, of course, one that lies far beyond 
adequate explanation ; but it is something to 
have realized, as Dr. Federn has done, that 
this is the problem, and to have touched upon 
its solution with much psychological insight, 
and a complete avoidance of pedantry. 

Mr. W. J. Payling Wright's little book 
of " Studies and Notes " on " Dante and the 
Divine Comedy " offers practically nothing in 
the way of research, but merely represents a 
few simple points of view that have been taken 
hundreds of times before, and gives elementary 
explanations of the leading facts of Dante's life 
and work. It is dictated by reverence, and, 
for the most part, by sympathy, although we 
find a jarring note in the opinion that in 
Dante's character " there lurked a vein of 
innate ferocity." The author selects his mat- 
ters judiciously, and presents them in a sin- 
gularly lucid style. The first chapter, which 
sums up the historical significance and impli- 
cations of the battle of Benevento, is perhaps 
the most useful of them all. 

Dr. Richard Thayer Holbrook has made a 
deeply-interesting study of the animal lore of 
the Middle Ages as reflected in the writings of 
Dante, and this work, entitled " Dante and the 
Animal Kingdom," appears as a publication of 
Columbia University. Altogether, Dante men- 
tions about a hundred animals, real or legend- 
ary. These references occur most abundantly 
in the " Convito " and the " De Vulgari Elo- 
quentia," but those who are acquainted with 
the " Commedia " alone will realize that the 
subject offers abundant material for investiga- 
tion. Dante made use of animals chiefly for 
imagery or symbolism, and we must not look 
to him for anything like a forecast of the mod- 
ern scientific spirit, but it is certainly interest- 
ing to search out his allusions to the animal 
kingdom for the light which they shed upon 
mediaeval notions of natural history. Doctor 
Thayer's work is done with great thoroughness, 
and makes a copious use of quotations. The 
illustrations, some of them colored, are mostly 
from old manuscripts and designs, and add not 
a little to the value of the book. Besides ani- 
mals in our understanding of the term — from 
the fungo marino to man — we have all kinds of 
monsters, most of them grouped under the cate- 
gory of " The Devil and his Brood." Here come 
Charon, Minos, Geryon, and Lucifer, besides 
furies, harpies, and centaurs. The angels also 
receive treatment in a special chapter. There 
can hardly be a doubt that Dante accepted these 
imaginations as realities. To affirm that he did 



not would, as the author remarks, " betoken an 
inadequate knowledge of the age in which he 
lived. Whoever reads carefully the works of 
an Albertus Magnus, a Thomas Aquinas, or 
those of Dante, cannot fail to perceive how 
greatly their credulity exceeds our own." 

An excellent service to students of Dante 
has been performed by Mr. George P. Hunt- 
ington, who has compiled a volume containing 
all the " Comments of John Raskin on the 
Divina Commedia." Readers of Ruskin know 
how suggestive and illuminating are his crit- 
ical observations upon the great masters of 
literature, however wrong-headed they may be 
in particular instances. In the case of Dante, 
his power of penetrative sympathy is so great 
that we are not often required, as we are in 
the case of some of the great writers whom he 
discusses, to take exception to what he says, 
on the ground of whimisicality or petulance. 
In almost every instance, his words about 
Dante ring true, and are helpful to our under- 
standing. His references to Dante are prob- 
ably more frequent and substantial in amount 
than his references to any other poet, and we 
are not surprised that they should make, when 
brought together, a volume of considerable 
dimensions. Professor Charles Eliot Norton,, 
who writes an introduction to Mr. Hunting- 
ton's book, makes the following summary of 
Ruskin's relations with Dante : 

" But whatever errors may be found in Mr. Ruskin's- 
comments, or however fanciful some of them may be, 
his imaginative insight and his intense moral sentiment 
brought him into such sympathy with the poet that he 
entered deeply into the spiritual purport of the poem, 
and was thus enabled to reveal and illuminate the truth 
which often lies hidden within verses that to most read- 
ers seem simple narrative. There is no student of the 
" Divine Comedy " but will derive stimulating sugges- 
tion from these comments and be helped by them to read 
the poem with keener intelligence and fuller apprecia- 
tion of its interest and significance." 

The opening section of the present volume 
collects the general references to Dante, his 
artistic relations, his interpreters, and the char- 
acteristics, sources, and inspiration of his great 
work. The comments upon special passages 
of the " Divine Comedy " then follow, arranged 
in the order of the cantos concerned. There 
are references to every canto but two of the 
" Inferno," every canto but three of the " Pur- 
gatorio," and to more than one-half of the 
cantos of the " Paradiso." Where Ruskin uses 
the English translations his text is followed 
without change; where he quotes from the 
original, the text is amended according to a 
modern recension.

It is not altogether inappropriate to include 
within this review, and to conclude it there- 
with, a word descriptive of " The Great Poets 
of Italy," by Professor Oscar Kuhns. The 
chapters upon Dante occupy nearly a third of 
this volume, and are well adapted for the needs 
of beginners. The entire work is, in fact, ele- 
mentary, as is seen from the fact that it is the 
rearrangement of an earlier volume which was 
prepared for the special uses of the Chautauqua 
Circles. Besides dealing with the five great 
classical poets of Italy, the work gives us an 
introductory chapter on the origins, and con- 
cludes with two new chapters on the modern 
age from Alfieri to Carducci. Copious quota- 
tions are supplied throughout, and the trans- 
lations are selected with admirable taste. As an 
elementary introduction to the history of Italian

" Madame de Montespan was something more than 
the mistress of le Grand Monarque, the mother of 
legitimated princes and princesses. . . . She was the 
symbol of her age, the spirit of seventeenth century 
France incarnate. In her we find almost all the best 
and worst characteristics of the great epoch in French 
history — its dignity and splendour, its genuine admira- 
tion for literature and art, its exquisite courtesy, its 
light-hearted gaiety, its brilliant wit, side by side with 
its arrogance and egotism, its senseless prodigality, its 
flagrant disregard of the moral law, its gross super- 
stition. In studying her life we are studying not her 
alone, but the whole society of which she was the rep- 
resentative." 

It is thus that Mr. H. Noel Williams apologizes for 
devoting a bulky volume (imported by Scribner) to 
Madame de Montespan, bat his real justification lies 
in the fact that he has folly succeeded in painting 
her in this larger aspect ; has written " backstairs 
history " so as to lift it above the level of scandal, 
and make it fulfil its legitimate function, — that of 
supplying atmosphere, of giving vividness and real- 
ity, to the great transactions of any age. After his 
excellent life of Madame de Pompadour, he could 
be trusted to approach a similar task in this spirit, 
and to carry it on with thoroughness and brilliancy. 
His view of Madame de Montespan is essentially 
that which modern research has established beyond 
reasonable doubt ; that far from being Louis's un- 
willing victim, she deliberately planned, for finan- 
cial reasons, to become his mistress ; that all through 
the twelve years of her reign she resorted to the 
basest means to keep her power ; and that ruin over- 
took her when, in 1680, Louis discovered her deal- 
ings with the prisoner La Voisin and her fiendish 



associates. As this is the first biography in English 
which embodies the discoveries of Ravaisson and 
other modern scholars, it is a distinct contribution 
to the history of its period, and deserves much fuller 
comment than can be given to it here. But as an ex- 
ample of splendid bookmaking, it deserves first place 
among the season's holiday publications, and it is in 
this aspect that we wish to call attention to it. It 
is printed in large type with generous margins, and 
bound in green buckram stamped in gold. In pro- 
portion to its large size, the volume is remarkably 
light and easy to handle. There are sixteen superb 
portraits reproduced in photogravure from old 
French engravings. Among the subjects represented 
are Louis XIV., his queen and his three mistresses, 
Colbert, Bossuet, la Grande Mademoiselle, and the 
Due da Maine. The frontispiece is a beautiful plate 
from Picart's engraving of Madame de Montespan, 
of whom there are also two other portraits, one by an 
unknown painter, the other from Pierre Schenk's 
engraving. 

" World's Children, by Mortimer Menpes, text 
by Dorothy Menpes," — thus runs the title-page of 
a richly-bound volume issued by the Macmillan Co. 
As is indicated by the reversed order which pats the 
illustrator's name first, this is a picture book ; and 
it is a very delightful one. The color printing, which 
was done at the Menpes press under the superin- 
tendence of the artist and his daughters, is remark- 
ably satisfactory, being brilliant bat not glaring. 
Mr. Menpes's studies are charming ; there is not a 
child of the hundred pictured in the book who is 
not both childlike and lovable — whether he be the 
little Canadian toddler bandied in far for his first 
walk, a pensive Roumanian lassie, a yellow baby of 
Burmah, or a pampered little Miss from America. 
It is perhaps unfair to criticise the text. One may 
paint the children of the world, but no one can 
write of them all except in platitudes. National 
traits are not strong in children. In every land 
they are inevitably the creatures of their parents' cir- 
cumstances, so that there are endless social strata to 
be considered. The London street arab has nothing 
in common with the children of Mayfair, and there 
are dozens of grades between. So Miss Menpes 
has possibly made the best of a bad matter. We 
can well afford to smile at some of her pleasing 
generalities, and still admire the book for the sake 
of the really interesting information which it con- 
tains, and for the pictures. 

" Between the high Sierras south from Yosem- 
ite — east and south over a very great assemblage 
of broken ranges beyond Death Valley, and on 
illimitably into the Mojave Desert," — there Mrs. 
Mary Austin tells as lies " The Land of Little 
Rain." The Indians call it the Country of Lost 
Borders ; and she prefers that name to " Desert " 
for a place that, to the patient observer, is far from 
being void of life. There are hills there, "blunt, 
burned, squeezed up oat of chaos, chrome and ver- 
milion painted "; and between the hills are steep 
and narrow canons, oftener than not dry at the

bottom, and high sun-baked mesas where the dust- 
devils dance to the wind's piping. By day, the land 
is very still, spell-bound in the glare of the sun ; but 
in the late afternoon the birds appear, and the little 
furry folk creep out from cover and take to their 
tiny ribbon-like water trails. Then the hawk and 
the eagle skim over the sage, the coyote lurks by 
the rabbit-form, the " billy-owl," the bob-cat, and 
the red fox gather at the water-holes, all watching 
their chance to prey on smaller creatures. Where- 
ever there are cattle there are scavengers, — buz- 
zards and ravens ; and in the dry years vultures, in 
terrible black clouds. There are men, too, in the 
desert : cattlemen, miners bitten with tales of lost 
treasure, and Paiute Indians ; there is Jimville, a 
Bret Harte town, and Las Uvas, a Mexican pueblo. 
There is indeed tragedy in the desert ; but Mrs. 
Austin wonders if convention has not over-empha- 
sized that note. The lonely land takes heavy toll 
of the visitor, but it pays high returns; and once 
its charm is on you, you may curse it and leave it, 
but you will surely come back. Mrs. Austin did 
not go to the desert to write it up. She has lived on 
its borders for years, and because she knows and 
loves it she can reproduce its atmosphere of ro- 
mance, of silence, and of strangeness. Mr. E. Boyd 
Smith has done admirable work in illustrating the 
volume and decorating the margins with character- 
istic and suggestive bits of desert scenery. The 
book is published in handsome holiday binding by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

Miss Elisabeth Luther Cary's illustrated mono- 
graph on the Rossettis, published two years ago, is 
now followed by an elaborate edition, in two hand- 
some volumes, of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poems, 
with illustrations from his own work, and an intro- 
duction and critical notes by Miss Cary. The bind- 
ing is similar to that of the previous work, but a little 
less ornate. The paper and printing are of the same 
excellence as before, and the photogravure reproduc- 
tions, thirty-two in number, naturally include several 
pictures that appeared in the earlier volume — not- 
ably the " Found " and the " Lady Lilith " then first 
reproduced from the originals through the courtesy 
of their, owner, Mr. Samuel J. Bancroft, Jr. The ad- 
vantage of having Rossetti's poetry and paintings 
between the same covers is obvious, and to the 
Rossettian the bulk of this edition will be, in 
proportion, a very slight drawback. Miss Cary's 
notes call attention to important variations occur- 
ring in different editions, and supply such biograph- 
ical detail as will serve to connect the poems with 
the man whose very incomplete expression they 
were. Without being technical or exhaustive, these 
notes add greatly to the interest of the poems. But 
the peculiar value of the edition lies of course in 
the pictures, with their many-colored cross-lights on 
the poems, which in turn often define or add sugges- 
tivenesB to the meaning of the pictures. (Putnam.) 

The publication by Messrs. A. C McClurg & Co. 
of a beautiful portfolio of sketches by Miss Hazel 
Martyn, will arouse increased interest in the work 



of this talented young Chicago artist. The present 
collection contains ten plates in color from chalk 
drawings, the subjects all being heads of young 
women. The originals of several of the sketches 
were exhibited in Chicago last spring ; others are 
from French types studied during Miss Martyn's 
recent stay in Paris. The drawings are marked by 
an economy of line and a dash and brilliancy of 
finish that suggest Helleu, but the faces are often 
prettier. The lithographic process of reproduction 
has produced excellent results. The portfolio cover, 
which is made attractive by Miss Martyn's design, 
is strong enough to protect its contents — as too 
many portfolios are not. The collection will make 
an ideal Christmas gift. 

Mr. E. F. Benson, of " Dodo " memory, has 
written a " Book of Months " (Harper) in which he 
relates, in the first person singular, the experiences 
and adventures that filled twelve months in the life 
of a London man-about-town. There is some vivid 
description in the book, considerable witty philoso- 
phizing, and the inevitable love-story, which, begin- 
ning very unpropitiously in May, ends happily in 
the December chapter. It is perhaps not unfair to 
assume that the literary confidences are autobio- 
graphical and that Mr. Benson shares many of the 
habits, beliefs, and opinions with which he endows 
his hero. But the romance, related in quite a dif- 
ferent style, is clearly an interpolation which results 
in an odd lack of unity in both style and subject 
matter. This, however, seems appropriate rather 
than otherwise for a " Book of Months." The dec- 
orative features of the book are unusually handsome. 
They consist of marginal borders which change in 
design and coloring with the four seasons, and a 
very effective cover of heavy green buckram, in 
which is set a panel with a sun-dial design and the 
legend, " Horas non numero nisi serenas." Mr. 
Benson has not quite lived up to his motto, but the 
" cheerful yesterdays " are much in the majority, 
and there is a good deal of the spirit of Christmas 
about the entire book. 

When Mr. Egerton R. Williams, Jr., wished to 
make some preparation for a contemplated visit to 
the cities of the Apennines, he was disappointed 
to find that there was nothing to read upon the 
subject except profound archaeological treatises and 
fugitive essays. It was the lack of a comprehen- 
sive book about the most interesting country in the 
world — as Mr. Williams calls central Italy — that 
led him to write his volume on " Hill Towns of 
Italy" (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.). The record is 
a personal one ; the hill towns are described in the 
order in which Mr. Williams visited them, and 
their history, treasures of art and architecture, 
legends and romance, are set forth as he sought 
them out in his summer wanderings. He thor- 
oughly enjoyed the picturesque, dilapidated little 
villages, always built on the edge of a ravine, with 
their noisy and precipitous streets, dirty inns, tum- 
ble-down houses, and ruined castles ; and he makes 
his readers see and enjoy them too. His work is 



1903.] 



THE DIAL

careful and detailed, calculated to appeal especially 
to students of art and history. Most of the illus- 
trations are intended as aids to an appreciation 
of the architecture of the hill towns, but natural 
scenery is not neglected, and there are a few repro- 
ductions of great paintings. The cover design is 
one of the most attractive to be found among the 
holiday books. 

Mr. John Lane, publisher of " The International 
Studio," has prepared two collections of plates for 
the holiday trade, " The Art Portfolio " and " The 
Art Album," representing the best work that has 
appeared in " The Studio " during the past seven 
years. The former consists of sixteen plates in color 
and photogravure, intended for hanging or framing. 
To that end they are artistically mounted, fitted with 
brass rings for hanging, and enclosed in a handsome 
portfolio. " The Art Album " is a book of one hun- 
dred plates, similarly chosen and meant to show, in 
compact and convenient form, a little of the progress 
of contemporary art during the period covered. 
Both selections have been made with a view to 
securing variety in subject and in method of repro- 
duction, and both represent very adequately, though 
of course on different scales, the somewhat bizarre 
and " modern," but always interesting, type of art 
for which " The Studio " stands. Either will cer- 
tainly prove a very acceptable gift for an art-loving 
friend. As the memory of even the most constant 
reader of " The Studio " can hardly be expected to 
stretch back infallibly over seven years, an accom- 
panying list of the names and artists of the plates 
in the " Portfolio " and an index to the " Album " 
would have added to the value of each. 

A book for those who like to read about the stage 
and its people is Mr. Gustav Kobbe"s " Famous 
Actors and Actresses and their Homes " (Little, 
Brown, & Co.). The book is devoted to entertaining 
accounts of the private life, families, homes, friends, 
and favorite amusements of nine popular stage 
favorites of to-day, with two supplementary chapters 
upon " The Lambs' " and ■ The Players' " Clubs. 
Most, if not all, of the sketches have already ap- 
peared separately in " The Ladies' Home Journal." 
The decorative cover and the illustrations are an 
important feature of the book. The frontispiece is 
a beautiful photogravure from Mr. Irving R. Wiles's 
portrait of Miss Marlowe. The other pictures are 
excellent half-tones representing the actors and 
actresses in their homes or enjoying their favorite 
recreations. The last two chapters are embellished 
with pictures of the rooms of the two famous actors' 
clubs, and portraits of their founders and choice 
spirits. 

Appropriately bound in royal purple is Miss 
Sarah A. Tooley's large octavo volume entitled 
" Royal Palaces and their Memories " (A. Wessels 
Co.). Windsor, St. James's, Hampton Court, 
Kensington, and Buckingham are the palaces de- 
scribed. As they have, collectively, been the homes 
of all English monarchs since the days of William 
the Conqueror, their "memories" might easily 



lapse into a compendium of English history. But 
Miss Tooley has used considerable skill in picking 
out vivid bits of incident to stand for each period, 
in showing the every-day round that went on within 
the palaces — the human and personal, rather than 
the public and ceremonial, side of court life, — and 
in building up a personality for each inmate rather 
than crowding her narrative with plot interest. 
The result is an entertaining and intimate account, 
necessarily sketchy considering the space of time 
it covers, including enough descriptive detail to 
make the settings real but not enough to be tire- 
some, — in short, a book to please the average 
reader, if we may speak of such a person. It is 
beautifully illustrated, the large size of the pages 
making possible exceptionally clear and effective 
half- ton es. 

Romance seems to be a popular note with the 
holiday writers. Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champney'a 
"Romance of the Bourbon Chateaux" (Putnam) 
follows two similar volumes by the same author, 
dealing respectively with the feudal and the renais- 
sance chateaux. Like its predecessors, this book is 
luxuriously bound and copiously illustrated, having 
a colored frontispiece from a water-color by Mr. 
J. Wells Champney and numerous photogravure and 
half-tone plates of the chateaux and their surround- 
ing parks and gardens. Mrs. Champney spent years 
learning to know Versailles, and hunting out other 
Bourbon chateaux near Paris or in remote corners 
of Burgundy and Brittany. And now, instead of 
giving us the result as an architectural study or a 
detailed record of her wanderings, she prefers, as 
she has done twice before, to write ten little stories 
whose scenes are laid in the old chateaux. There 
is, to be sure, an eleventh chapter entitled " The 
Bourbons and their Chateaux — a Summary of the 
Period for the Serious- Minded "; but most of us 
will uphold Mrs. Champney by leaving this serious- 
minded chapter where she puts it, at the end. In 
her preface Mrs. Champney humbly suggests that 
her stories may make a future visit to the Bourbon 
castles more enjoyable, but they are far too deftly 
written, too fresh and spirited, to deserve any such 
second-hand recognition. As romances they are ex- 
ceedingly entertaining ; as a serious interpretation 
of the times of Louis the Grand, their value would 
be greatly increased by a bibliography and an index. 

Two years ago, when " Alice in Wonderland " 
appeared with pictures by Mr. Peter Newell, some 
of us felt inclined to cry " Hands off ! — we want 
no Alice pictures but Sir John Tenniel's." The new 
beasts are very amusing, but they do not belong in 
our " Wonderland," and no other will ever be quite 
so delightful. But it is different with " The Hunting 
of the Snark, and Other Poems " which Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers offer this year, bound, like their 
"Alice in Wonderland," in vellum with gold letter- 
ing, and having page decorations in color and forty 
full-page tinted pictures by Mr. Newell. The rhymes 
from '• Alice in Wonderland " and " Through the 
Looking-Glass " are included, of course ; but there 



424 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



is only one illustration which duplicates Sir John 
Tenniel's, and so far as we know he never illustrated 
any of the other verses. Mr. Newell's Snark is 
delightfully mysterious and " boojum "; the Badgers 
and the Herrings could not be better ; and the Phan- 
tom is very ghostly indeed. We feel that the artist 
has missed a point in not drawing a Jubjub bird, 
and we hardly consider his Bandersnatch sufficiently 
" frumious." Nevertheless, the edition will be a 
rare treasure to all who enjoy " Lewis Carroll's " 
delicious fooling. 

" Old Quebec," a bulky volume by Sir Gilbert 
Parker and Mr. Claude G. Bryan, comes to us from 
the Macmillan Co. The authors make no claim 
to originality, but present their work as an assim- 
ilation, in popular and accessible form, of the abun- 
dant data recorded by Jesuit priests and pio- 
neers, by Francis Parkman and other historians of 
Canada. The story of Quebec is told in historical 
sequence, from the time of the city's foundation by 
Champlain to the present day, when, shorn of her 
commercial and political prestige, she watches the 
dreams of her youth come true — for another na- 
tion. There are surely few more fascinating fields 
of research in all the annals of history. Romance, 
pathos, stirring incident, noble characters, give vivid 
interest to every stage of the story which is here 
done full justice. The style of the book is direct, 
yet brilliant and picturesque, — such as we should 
expect from Sir Gilbert Parker. The numerous 
illustrations are of two kinds, small half-tones and 
full-page portraits in photogravure, the latter being 
very effective. The impression left by the book is 
one of authority, solidity, and thorough-going excel- 
lence ; of charm which involves no sacrifice of truth 
to meretricious interest. These qualities will com- 
bine with its handsome exterior and copious illus- 
tration to recommend it to holiday buyers. 

While many modern nature-writers are remark- 
able for habits of close and careful observation, 
Richard Jefferies is conspicuous for having in addi- 
tion a rare refinement of feeling and much delicacy 
of imagination. In him, as has been well said, 
" the naturalist and the poet were harmonized." 
That American readers may know more of this man, 
who is undoubtedly the foremost interpreter of 
nature among Englishmen of his century, a new 
edition of his characteristic work on " Wild Life in 
a Southern County " has been prepared under the 
title of "An English Village" (Little, Brown, & 
Co.). The scenes described in the text are made 
more vivid by means of illustrations from pho- 
tographs taken for the purpose by Mr. Clifton 
Johnson, who has supplied a brief biographical note; 
while Mr. H. W. Mabie furnishes an appreciative 
interpretation of Jefferies's work. Mr. Johnson's 
photographs harmonize in their clearness and care 
for detail and in their emphasis of the human ele- 
ment in the picture, with jefferies's text. But they 
lack subtlety, as photographs always must ; so they 
furnish no hint of the poetic imagination and sense 
of artistic form by which Jefferies glorified his world 



of common things. This is merely to say that no 
photographs can do justice to Jefferies's " English 
Village. " What they do show, and that very well, 
is the country around Coate in Wiltshire, where his 
early life was passed, and in and around which he 
rambles with his readers. To the Americans in his 
company pictures of this background will be par- 
ticularly valuable. So Mr. Johnson's beautiful and 
painstaking work is certain to be appreciated, at 
the same time that its limits are understood. 

Miss Geraldine Brooks's volume of " Romances 
of Colonial Days" (Crowell) contains nine short sto- 
ries in which, working on a more or less secure foot- 
ing of fact, the author has built up as many half- 
fanciful, Colonial romances of the years between 
1621 and 1785. John Alden and Priscilla, Major 
Andre*, Governor Wentworth, the Pepperells, Cus- 
tises, Adamses, and Bryds, with others less familiar, 
have their part in the narratives, which depict in 
simple and entertaining fashion the everyday life 
of pre-revolutionary times in America. In writing 
of " Dames and Daughters of Colonial Days," Miss 
Brooks learned her ground thoroughly. She is not 
a finished story-teller, yet she succeeds in giving 
some very effective and convincing pictures of life 
in the mansions of our colonial ancestors. A unique 
and attractive cover, with nine illustrations by Mr. 
Arthur E. Becher, reproduced in half-tone and pho- 
togravure, give to the book the distinction of a hol- 
iday publication. 

Mr. Clifton Johnson has chosen "The Land of 
Heather" (Macmillan) as the title for his record 
of rambles through Scotland, because he thinks that 
" the hardiness and warm bloom of the heather " 
expresses the racial individuality of modern Scot- 
land better than the prickliness of the national 
thistle. In accordance with this theory and also 
with his previous practice, it is the less strenuous 
side of Scottish life that Mr. Johnson depicts. He 
and his camera spent a summer at Diumtochty, 
which is described rather as a typical Scotch village 
than as Ian Maclaren's workshop. Then they took 
a leisurely journey to Edinburgh, and spent some 
time among its historic landmarks. Later they paid 
a brief visit to Kirriemuir, alias Thrums, went by 
stage and boat through the Highlands, got a glimpse 
of life in the Hebrides, saw the Burns country, and 
rounded up in Galloway. Records of similar trips 
through rural France, England, Ireland, and New 
England, have made Mr. Johnson's simple an- 
ecdotal style and quiet humor familiar to many 
readers. The new book owes the usual debt to the 
author's camera, which has contributed about eighty 
photographs of peasant life and natural scenery. 
The decidly unique cover design shows a solemn 
Highland piper playing busily on his queer instru- 
ment. 

A very individual book on a commonplace theme 
is "Cities" (Pott) by the Euglish poet and critic, 
Mr. Arthur Symons. The title would indicate 
either a guide-book or a traveller's account of his 
experiences, and its vague generality is not pre- 



1903]

possessing. But closer examination shows that Mr. 
Symons's method is very different from that of the 
ordinary traveller-author. He writes only of what 
really appeals to him, keeping himself well in the 
background. He has a keen power of analysis and, 
as we should expect, a fine feeling for words. His 
essays are consequently brilliant impressionist pic- 
tures, full of color and movement, very subjective, 
yet real and convincing. " Rome is a sea in which 
many worlds have gone down and its very pave- 
ment is all in waves." " Naples has ceased to be 
merely horrible to me, a boiling pot ; it has become 
a witches' cauldron." There are many sentences as 
picturesque and suggestive as these, which have 
been taken unfairly from their setting. The cities 
of which Mr. Symons writes are Rome, Venice, 
Naples, Seville, Prague, Moscow, Budapest, Sofia, 
Belgrade, and Constantinople. Eight excellent 
photogravure illustrations from old pictures harmon- 
ize in finish and distinction with the style of the 
essays. The binding is plain and beautiful, in keep- 
ing with the contents. Text and make-up will appeal 
to readers of discriminating taste. 

Five years ago there was published a book of 
essays entitled " Friendship " by that most popular 
of Scottish preachers, Mr. Hugh Black. This is 
now reprinted uniformly with a new volume by 
the same author on "Work " (Revell). Those who 
have read and enjoyed Mr. Black's inspiring words 
about Friendship will be glad to re-read them in 
this handsome volume, whose fine binding and dec- 
orative headings and page borders ought to win for 
it many new friends. The same earnest spirit and 
vigorous mode of expression characterize the new 
volume also. Mr. Black's main contention is a 
telling protest against the common social ideal that 
makes ease and pleasure, instead of work and serv- 
ice, the end of living ; that considers the profits of 
employment, instead of the moral dignity of labor 
for its own sake. He discusses no social or eco- 
nomic problems, but treats his subject in that largest 
aspect which applies equally to all classes and indi- 
viduals. "Idleness and Work," "The Habit of 
Work," "The Duty of Work," "The Gospel of 
Work," " The Consecration of Work " are a few of 
his chapter-headings, but they give no idea of his 
fresh and original treatment of a somewhat hack- 
neyed theme. Like its companion volume, this is 
richly bound and printed on deckle-edge paper, with 
colored marginal borders and other decorations. 
For a friend of a philosophic turn of mind few bet- 
ter gifts could be found than these two books, full 
of "high thinking," but written in a way to appeal 
to the average man. 

" Old Paths and Legends of New England " 
(Putnam), by Miss Katharine M. Abbott, is an 
outgrowth of the wide demand for the little paper- 
bound "Trolley Trips " by the same author. Finding 
that the public was really interested in the his- 
toric spots of New England, Miss Abbott has pre- 
pared a 460-page book on the same theme, with 
careful annotations and a complete index. The 



amount of material here presented will amaze most 
readers. Accustomed to think of their country as 
still young and comparatively bare of literary and 
historical associations, they will not be prepared 
for the rush of Miss Abbott's words, nor for the 
number of interesting cities and villages in Massa- 
chusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire that 
she mentions. Fifty-six towns besides Boston are 
described. The homes and haunts of famous men, 
historic spots of national or local interest, pictur- 
esque bits of scenery, places associated with Indian 
legends or quaint Yankee traditions, are all noticed 
in Miss Abbott's pages, so that whatever the reader's 
taste he should find something to suit it. Of course 
the book is illustrated ; there are pictures on nearly 
half the pages, representing in pictorial form all the 
varied, interests of the text. In a pocket in the back 
cover is a travellers' map. 

The Outlook Company has reprinted some of 
Mr. Hamilton W. Mabie's critical papers in a 
handsome volume entitled " Backgrounds of Lit- 
erature." The seven essays included treat of 
Wordsworth, Emerson, Irving. Goethe, Blackmore, 
Whitman, and Scott. They differ considerably in 
scope and method of treatment, but most of them 
combine an analysis of the author's work with an 
account of the environment — whether physical as 
with Wordsworth, or human as with Whitman — 
which he wrote into it. There is nothing striking 
or iconoclastic about Mr. Mabie's judgments. As 
usual, he says the rather conventional thing grace- 
fully and well. The numerous pictures of the 
" backgrounds " show to much better advantage in 
the book than they did in the pages of " The 
Outlook," where Mr. Mabie's essays fir*t appeared. 
Those of Concord, made from drawings by Miss 
Elizabeth Roberts, are especially interesting. 

The new volume in " Miranda's Library " (Dent- 
Dutton) is Browning's " Men and Women," re- 
printed with many line drawings by Mr. H. Ospovat, 
set in red page-borders, with the title- page and the 
headings of the poems also in red and bla> k. The 
dramatic picturesqueness of " Men and Women," 
which must appeal to the least imaginative reader, 
aids the task of illustration, while at the same time 
it renders it more exacting. For previoux concep- 
tions are hard to satisfy ; and it is inevitable, too, 
since not every poem is or can be illustrated, that 
some favorites will seem to be slighted. That one 
wishes for more of Mr. Ospo vat's work, is perhaps 
the highest tribute that can be paid to it. The book 
is beautifully printed on firm soft paper of very 
light weight. 

Two new volumes of Mr. Elbert Hubbard's 
"Little Journeys" (Putnam) are now published 
— to the homes of "Famous Musicians" and of 
" English Authors." Whatever their faults, Mr. 
Hubbard's essays are never commonplace. There 
is a briskness about his epigrams, a breezy enthu- 
siasm about his point of view, that is admirable, and 
that is undoubtedly the key to the continued popu-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



Hubbard has chosen to "visit" are Wagner, Paga- 
nini, Chopin, Mozart, Bach, Liszt, Mendelssohn, 
Beethoven, Handel, Verdi, Schumann, and Brahms. 
The English authors are Morris, Browning, Tenny- 
son, Macaulay, Addison, Burns, Milton, Johnson, 
Southey, Coleridge, Disraeli, and Byron. The 
chapter on Burns, being entirely devoted to an 
exposition of Mr. Hubbard's ideas about love-mak- 
ing, ends with a scant half-page of biography and 
a dismissal of the reader to the " Encyclopaedia 
Britannica" ("a compilation that I cheerfully re- 
commend") for the rest of the facts. The chapter 
on Mozart is picturesquely divided into sections ac- 
cording to the stations on the Lake Shore railroad, 
travelling on which Mr. Hubbard hastily endeav- 
ored to replace the manuscript which a careless 
porter had thrown out of the window. A number 
of fine portraits are scattered through each volume, 
and the binding is at once tasteful and serviceable. 

It was probably Mr. Elbert Hubbard who set the 
fashion of attaching the term " pilgrimage " to a 
biographical and critical sketch. We have long 
since learned what to expect of Mr. Hubbard's 
journeyings, but it is annoying to find his per- 
nicious use of the word adopted in other quarters. 
We have, for instance, the " Little Pilgrimages " 
series (Page), two new volumes of which have 
appeared this Fall. One of these is the second 
volume of " Among the Men who have Written 
Famous Books," by Mr. Edward F. Harkins. It 
consists of brief accounts of some living American 
authors, among them Messrs. George Ade, Robert 
W. Chambers, Peter Dunne, Jack London, Hop- 
kinson Smith, Booth Tarkington, Owen Wister, 
and a dozen others. A photograph of the subject 
precedes each sketch. Mr. Harkins's idea of a 
famous book is very elastic and his style savors of 
Newspaper Row, but he has succeeded in produc- 
ing a book that is at least thoroughly readable. 

The other new volume in the " Little Pilgrim- 
ages " series is called " The Romance of Old New 
England Churches," and is written by Miss Mary 
C. Crawford. It is a curiously heterogeneous col- 
lection of fact and surmise, often very loosely con- 
nected with any church or even with any minister. 
" Courtship according to Samuel Sewall," for ex- 
ample, one of the most interesting chapters, is 
brought under the main title by virtue of the facts 
that Judge Sewall made his famous confession at 
the Old South Church, and that his son later be- 
came its assistant pastor. But the Old South had 
absolutely nothing to do with his delicious wooing 
of Madame Winthrop. But if Miss Crawford does 
not always keep within the limits of her title, she 
picks up some very entertaining bits of story by 
the way. So the reader is inclined to be tolerant. 
The book is illustrated with portraits and photo- 
graphs of churches and personages. 

" In the Palaces of the Saltan " (Dodd, Mead & 
Co.) is the story of Mrs. Anna Bowman Dodd's 
stay in Constantinople, which city she visited as the 
guest of General Horace Porter, United States 



Ambassador to France. As a member of General 
Porter's party, she was received at the Sultan's court, 
decorated by him with the order of the Shefakat, 
entertained at dinner, and conducted through his 
miles of parks and palaces by an official deputed 
for the purpose. In company with General and 
Mrs. Porter, too, she got her first glimpses of the 
composite city of Constantinople, and after their 
departure she remained behind to study its life more 
closely. The account of a visit made under such 
unique conditions could scarcely fail to be interest- 
ing. Mrs. Dodd has a gift of graphic description, 
and her boundless and sometimes well-nigh breath- 
less enthusiasm for everything in and out of the 
Sultan's palaces results in a fresh and racy picture 
of life in the land of the Arabian Nights. Mrs. 
Dodd seems inclined, however, to take her work a 
little too seriously. She was after all only an out- 
sider, with exceptional advantages for observing 
the ways of the Sultan's court, but limited in her 
resources by the shortness of her visit and her 
ignorance of the Turkish language. As a very 
entertaining account of a very unusual experience 
her book deserves considerable praise and will 
attract many readers. Its white and gold cover is 
delicate but handsome, and the illustrations in half- 
tone and photogravure are both profuse and beau- 
tiful. The pictures cannot of course reflect the 
sacred splendors of the palaces, but Constantinople 
is picturesque enough to supply all the needed 
material without any infringement of the Sultan's 
privacy. 

Mr. Henry Harland's clever little story of " The 
Cardinal's Snuff-Box " has been selected by Mr. 
John Lane for a holiday reprint. The gay scarlet 
cover, — symbolic of his Eminence, — is decorated 
with golden snuff-boxes. The twenty dainty illus- 
trations, in pen-and-ink, are by Mr. G. C. Wilms- 
hurst, who has also drawn suggestive head and 
tail pieces for each chapter. Mr. Wilmshurst has 
caught the spirit of the story perfectly, the pub- 
lishers have provided excellent paper and typog- 
raphy, and the sum total is an unusually successful 
illustrated novel. 

" The Limerick Up to Date Book " (Paul Elder 
& Co.) is a combined calendar and memorandum, 
embellished with a series of limericks, old and new, 
for every week in the year. Miss Ethel Watts 
Mumford composed and collected the rhymes, and, 
assisted by Mr. Addison Mizner, illustrated them 
and drew the scarlet page-borders. The little book 
contains such old favorites as 

" There was an old man of Tarrentum," 
and 

" There was an old sculptor named Phidias," 

and there are many clever new ones. One, called 
" Truth," runs thus : 

" There was a young lady named Maude, 
Who said she was ' awfully boahed,' 

For all men she hated, 

Both single and mated — 
But in the dark corners — Good Lawd ! "

Golfers will appreciate "At a Cursory Glance," 
which tells how 

" A curate once smote at a tee, 
And threw his new club np a tree, 
Saying ' Fie ! My ! ! Oh dear ! 1 ! 
I must give up, I fear, 
Either golf or the Ministeree ! ' " 

The lovers of nonsense-verse are legion, and all of 
them will enjoy " The Limerick Up to Date Book." 

In preparing their illustrated holiday edition 
of John Fiske's "Dutch and Quaker Colonies in 
America," the publishers, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co., have spared no pains to secure everything 
in the way of illustrative material that would add 
in any degree to the historical interest of the text. 
" Portraits, maps, facsimiles [of documents, letters, 
title-pages, and autographs], contemporary views, 
and prints " — to quote from the title-page — have 
all been utilized, in many cases for the first time. 
The portraits, notably those of Erasmus, William 
Penn, and Robert Livingston, are very beautiful ; 
but the old maps and the " views," such as " Am- 
sterdam in the Seventeenth Century " from a Dutch 
engraving, and the quaint pictures of early New 
York, are rarer and more unique. There are in all 
twenty-four photogravure portraits, and over two 
hnndred other illustrations and maps, but in spite 
of this lavish abundance nothing has been included 
which does not possess distinct historical interest. 
The result is a complete, scholarly, and beautiful 
reprint of a fascinating original such as is seldom 
found even to-day. The edition is in two volumes, 
bound in polished green buckram, uniform with 
the similar edition of " The Beginnings of New 
England," which this work follows in historical 
sequence. The publishers also announce a large- 
paper edition in boards with paper label, and lim- 
ited to 250 numbered copies. 

A very alluring library edition which includes 
most of Stevenson's essays and sketches of travel 
is published in seven handy-size volumes by Messrs. 
Herbert B. Turner & Co. " Essays and Criti- 
cisms," " Memories and Portraits," " Familiar 
Studies of Men and Books" (in two volumes), 
" Virginibus Pueneque," "An Inland Voyage," and 
" Travels with a Donkey " are the titles. The first 
volume is the notable one, for eight of its essays have 
appeared in the " Edinburgh " and " Thistle " sub- 
scription editions only, while four have never been 
reproduced since their publication in the " Pall 
Mall Gazette." Walking tours, Swiss life, and the 
study of literature are the principal topics. The 
contents of the other six volumes need no comment. 
The frontispiece in each volume of the set is a dif- 
ferent photogravure portrait of Stevenson, the series 
of seven making a very interesting study. The title- 
pages are decorated with vignetted photogravures of 
scenes associated with the author, and there are a 
few additional photogravures and other illustrations 
in some of the volumes, and decorative initials, head- 
bands, and tail-pieces in all. The binding is of 
maroon silk cloth, stamped in gold, the paper of 



superior finish, the typography attractive, and a rib- 
bon marker is bound into each volume. The small 
size and daintiness of this edition will make it a very 
desirable holiday gift, and the fact that it is the re- 
print of a master^ work will give it a lasting value. 

Following close on the heels of the first edition of 
Mr. Charles Sprague Smith's chronicle of " Barbizon 
Days" comes the beautiful " Fontainebleau " edition 
in octavo form, limited to five hundred copies 
(A. Wessels Co.). The name of this edition is appro- 
priate, for it is the Fontainebleau of reality or the 
greater forest of the painters' imagination that is 
constantly brought before the reader by text and 
illustrations. Most of the latter are half-tones 
printed in an effective brown tint and surrounded 
by wide margins which set them off to advantage. 
Bits of forest vista, scenes in the hamlet of Barbizon 
and the near-by fields, Millet's peasant groups, 
Corot's and Rousseau's landscapes, and Barye's 
sculptures, all furnish numerous subjects for illus- 
tration. There is also a photogravure portrait of 
each of the four great Barbizon artists, that of Millet 
forming the frontispiece. It would be hard to find 
a more artistic gift-book than this. 

Two of the late Paul Leicester Ford's short sto- 
ries, "A Checked Love Affair" and " The Cortelyou 
Feud," have been brought together in a prettily dec- 
orated booklet by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. The 
tales are of the clever sentimental sort that Mr. 
Ford could write so well, and are unified by the fact 
that the redoubtable Mrs. Baxter figures as goddess 
ex machina in them both. Mr. Harrison Fisher 
has furnished five dainty pen-and-ink drawings, 
which are reproduced in photogravure. His pictures 
are charming, but we wish he had not used the same 
models for the characters in both stories. The 
cover design and the page decorations, consisting 
of elaborate marginal borders in blue and yellow, 
are by Mr. George Wharton Edwards. As a whole, 
the book is one of the prettiest of the lighter publi- 
cations of the season. 

" Miladi " is the fantastic title of Miss Clara E. 
Laughlin's new volume of essays about the twen- 
tieth century woman (Revell). The name is that 
of a bewitching heroine of romance who was Miss 
Laughlin's girlhood ideal. In this book she stands 
for the ideal womanly, and the essays attempt to 
show how she would solve the perplexing problems 
and fulfil the manifold duties that beset the young 
woman of to-day, keeping meanwhile a balance be- 
tween the claims of self and the claims of others. 
The point of view of the essays is distinctly femi- 
nine ; sometimes it is sentimental ; but generally it 
is sane, helpful, and convincing, evidently that of 
a woman with first-hand knowledge of the equivocal 
position of many girls of to-day, who, though not 
forced to earn a livelihood, long to set aside the 
small world of home for the larger world of in- 
dustry, and yet wish to do their duty. As is fitting, 
the volume is sensibly but prettily bound in deco- 
rated board covers, and there are rubricated initials 
for each chapter.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



"Among the Great Masters of the Drama," by 
Mr. Walter Rowlands, contains thirty-six brief 
sketches of great actors from the days when 
Shakespeare and Moliere took the boards in their 
own dramas to the present time. Bat among living 
actors, only those whose work is practically over 
and whose genius is assured have been included. 
The sketches make no attempt at complete biogra- 
phy, but amplify some typical episode or character- 
istic anecdote in bright and entertaining fashion. 
Each sketch is illustrated by a well-known painting 
of the subject, some explanation of which, with a 
brief mention of the painter, is included in the text. 
This volume makes the seventh in Messrs. Dana 
Estes & Co.'s " Great Masters " series of illustrated 
gift-books. 

A holiday edition of Hon. John Hay's " Castilian 
Days" (Houghton), with a few of the less pic- 
turesque chapters omitted, and about seventy illus- 
trations by Mr. Joseph Pennell, is a delightful 
addition to the season's publications. Secretary 
Hay's account of his travels in Spain has the unique 
charm that comes from a power of keen analysis, 
enthusiasm, a sense of humor, a feeling for the 
picturesque, and the gift of graceful and vigorous 
expression — a felicitous combination of qualities 
not often found in these days of made-to-order 
books of travel. The fact that the sketches were 
written some time ago, when Spain was greater 
than she is to-day, detracts nothing from the read- 
er's enjoyment. Mr. Pennell's drawings are the 
result of a special visit to Castile. They consist 
of full-page and text pictures in crayon, pen and 
ink, and wash, and form a suggestive and beautiful 
complement to the text. The cover design is bold 
and effective. 

Somewhat similar in form and spirit to " A Gbild 
of Nature" and "Under the Trees" is Mr. Hamil- 
ton W. Mabie's new book " In Arcady " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.). Mr. Charles L. Hinton has again 
provided the border designs and incidental deco- 
rations, and Mr. Will H. Low has illustrated the 
book with four exquisite photogravures. The text 
is a parable tracing the development of man's know- 
ledge and appreciation of the world of nature. The 
imagery, which is Greek, is emphasized by the pic- 
torial allegory of the illustrations and decorations, 
while the woodland atmosphere is carried out in 
the marginal decorations. This is one of the most 
complete and artistic of the smaller holiday pub- 
lications. 

Miss Onoto Watanna's charming Japanese stories 
are so widely known that extended comment upon 
the new one, " The Heart of Hyacinth " ( Harper) 
is quite unnecessary. Hyacinth is an American 
girl born and brought up in Japan, ignorant of her 
foreign parentage, and much ashamed of her blue 
eyes and her soft brown hair, which the best efforts 
of the hair-dresser cannot keep smooth for more 
than a fortnight. She speaks fascinating broken 
"Engleeh," prays to Kuannon, Mother of Mercy, 
and to the God of her fathers in turn ; and her heart 



is a wayward mixture of east and west, which she 
at last appropriately consigns into the keeping of 
a Japanese-English lover. Her story is printed on 
gold-topped pages, whose wide margins are deco- 
rated with fantastic designs in soft gray, by the 
Japanese artist Kiyokichi Sano. There are also 
five full-page plates in color. The cover design is 
a spray of white hyacinth on a lavendar ground. 
Altogether " The Heart of Hyacinth " is one of 
the daintiest and most attractive of the holiday 
publications. 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis's popular dog story, 
"The Bar Sinister," has been separated from the 
collection of tales with which it was first printed in 
book form and now appears by itself in a sumptu- 
ous little holiday volume (Scribner). The original 
drawings by Mr. E. M. Ashe, which accompanied 
the story when it came out in " Scribner's Maga- 
zine," are here beautifully reproduced in color, and 
suggestive marginal sketches in pen and ink have 
been added. The author answers the letters that 
came to him when the story first appeared, by a 
short preface which explains that " Kid " was, as 
many of the correspondents hoped, a real dog ; and 
his name and history, and the identity of his owner 
— Mr. Davis himself — are divulged. The very 
effective cover design shows " Kid's" escutcheon, a 
gold bar on an azure field. 

The central figure in Mr. Forrest Crissey's " The 
Country Boy " (Revell) is a solitary, shrinking little 
fellow, with ideas of the world, loves, hates, and 
longings that would be strange if so many children 
had not had them before him. The girls call him 
" ninny," and the reader is half inclined sometimes 
to call him prig. But he always saves himself from 
that appelation because, unlike many children in lit- 
erature, he is neither self-conscious nor precocious. 
His unreasoning fear of the dark, his shame-faced 
adoration of his mother, his awkward confidences 
to the " new teacher," his thrilling conquest of 
the " girl with the brown braids," and his " industri- 
ous vagrancy," are only a few of the things that 
make him real and lovable, and his adventures well 
worth reading. In her illustrations Miss Griselda 
Marshall McClure depicts the boy many times, and 
always charmingly. 

Mrs. Helen Philbrook Patten's volume on "The 
Year's Festivals" (Estes) is full of the merry 
spirit of the holiday season. Its simple, readable 
accounts of the origin, legends, and traditional 
methods of celebrating nine of the year's great 
festivals are gathered from many sources ; and the 
amount of interesting information that has been 
collected will surprise most readers and furnish 
many hints to hostesses in search of suggestions for 
a novel entertainment. The illustrations, from 
paintings representing scenes of holiday revelry, 
give an additional touch of festivity to the book, 
which is prettily and appropriately bound. 

A new edition of " Don Quixote," in four pocket 
volumes, with cloth, limp leather, or half-calf bind- 
ings, is issued by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. The 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



429 



standard translation of the novel by Ormsby is fol- 
lowed without abridgment, and his foot-notes and 
appendix of the proverbs of Don Quixote are re- 
tained. There is also an extended preface by the 
editor, Mr. James Fitzmanrice- Kelly ; so that the 
edition is scholarly, as well as compact and tasteful 
in form. A portrait of Cervantes and three etch- 
ings by Lalauze furnish the frontispiece illustrations. 

"The Shepherd's Pipe" is a slender little volume 
compiled by Mr. Fitzroy Carrington from the 
pastoral poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries, and published by Messrs. Fox, Duffield 
& Co. The selection has been made with taste and 
discrimination, and considering its small size it rep- 
resents very adequately the bucolic strain that once 
ran so sweetly through English verse. The arrange- 
ment of the poems is chronological, and there is an 
index to authors and to first lines. Portraits of half 
a dozen of the lyrists serve as illustrations. The 
grey board covers are novel and attractive. 

A collection of "Christmas Songs and Easter 
Carols" by the late Phillips Brooks is a holiday 
booklet that will appeal to many admirers of the 
great divine. It contains his beautiful " Little 
Town of Bethlehem," four other Christmas poems, 
and three carols for Easter. Paper and typography 
are of superior quality. The decoration consists of a 
rubricated title-page and ornamented headings and 
initials, besides a tasteful cover design in cream and 
gold. (Dutton.) 

" In Perfect Peace," a thirty-page booklet by the 
Rev. James R. Miller, D.D., has been reissued as a 
gift-book, with profuse illustrations and an ornate 
binding (Crowell). Dr. Miller's work always com- 
mands attention, and there will be many to enjoy 
and profit by this earnest and inspiring sermon, 
which gains a new emphasis from its dainty set- 
ting and from Mr. 6. H. Edwards's harmonious 
drawings. 

A sheaf of calendars for 1904 shows nothing so 
amusing as Mr. McCutcheon's " Boy Calendar " 
(McClurg), a series of twelve cartoons, some of 
which Chicago newspaper readers will remember. 
The episodes in the Boy's year are characteristic 
and full of humor. The Boy himself is omnipresent, 
and so is his Dog, with a horde of other boys and 
dogs only less delightful ; and Aunt Mary has not 
been forgotten. The Boy and his friends will cer- 
tainly prove cheering companions for the fleeting 
days of the new year. — "A Calendar of Prayers by 
Robert Louis Stevenson" (Alfred Bartlett) is one 
of the most beautiful of the season. Each of the 
twelve pages shows an artistic border in black enclos- 
ing a prayer whose rubricated initial letter adds a 
touch of color to the design. Even Stevenson could 
not write another petition equal to his familiar 
" At Morning "; but the spirit of the other prayers 
13 the same, and each one is good to think upon for 
a month. — Very similar in its decorations to the 
Stevenson Calendar is " The Symphony Calendar " 
(Alfred Bartlett). The brief quotations, which are 
meant to put the reader in tune with life, are vari- 



ously chosen from the words of Emerson, Thoreau, 
Huxley, Phillips Brooks, or Theodore Roosevelt, 
but the key-note of all is energetic optimism. — 
"The Canterbury Calendar " is in triptych form, the 
side panels showing the pilgrims starting from the 
inn and their arrival at Canterbury, while the cen- 
tral division represents the company riding merrily 
through a wood. The design, which is in antique 
style, is printed in colors, and the general effect is 
very pleasing. — A fourth of Mr. Alfred Bartlett'a 
publications is " A Stenciled Calendar " with seven 
animal pictures in color by Mr. Edward Penfield. 
No particular symbolism is apparent in the choice 
of beasts to stand for the various seasons. They are 
interesting, but we should enjoy them more if Mr. 
Oliver Herford or Mr. Gelett Burgess had written 
rhymes to accompany them. As it is, we are not 
sure just what sentiments they are intended to 
arouse. 



Books for the Young. 

L 



Of the books provided for children this year, there 
is little to say in the way of general comment. The 
output is at least as large as in past years ; the literary 
quality is about as it has been. In one respect only is 
any marked characteristic to be noticed, and this is the 
very considerable advance shown in the mechanical 
make-up of this season's books — especially in the mat- 
ter of illustrations. Not more than three years ago 
colored illustrations in children's books were something 
of a rarity ; to-day they are to be found in possibly a third 
of the season's output. The work of the best artists, 
the finest processes of reproduction, are to be met with 
as frequently now in books for children as in any other 
department of publishing activity. 

As regards literary quality, perhaps the best of the 
season's books are those dealing with school and college 
athletics. Historical romances for the young are as 
numerous as ever, but a tendency exists to bring them 
nearer the present time, as if in response to a journal- 
istic demand for something imminent enough for con- 
temporary interest. Stories dealing with business life 
are rather less numerous than usual. War, which has 
seemed to be losing ground of late, looms large in the 
reading for boys this year. By way of compensation, 
however, there are more volumes with a sociological 
tendency. One rather marked feature of the children's 
books of the season is the absence of reprinted classics 
in new and decorated editions; there are some books 
of the sort, but they are much less in evidence than in 
recent years. 

Beginning with the books dealing with 
out-of-door life, and bringing into the 
category those having to do with school 
and college life, since their interest is largely that of 
out-of-door games, we find in " Trapper Jim" (Mac- 
millan) a clever account, by Mr. Edwyn Sandys, of the 
manner in which a young man, a writer on hunting and 
fishing topics, takes in hand a small boy and brings him 
into rational interest and accord with the great animal 
world and with the breadth and freedom of life in the 
open. A more fascinating book for boys could hardly 
be selected. — Intended for those of fewer years and 
more imaginative qualities, Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton

has limited himself more than usually to facts in 
"Two Little Savages" (Doubleday), wherein a party 
of youngsters have good times playing at being Indians. 
This book, with its numerous illustrations and enticing 
make-up, should add many new recruits to Mr. Seton's 
large juvenile following. — A wholesome and readable 
story of college life, by Mr. Ralph Henry Barbour, en- 
titled " Weatherby's Inning " (Appleton), tells how a 
college freshman who is suspected of cowardice comes 
into his own again through good ball-playing and a 

faculty for minding his own business Mr. Eustace 

L. Williams also writes about baseball in " The Mu- 
tineers " (Lothrop), giving a vivid account of the 
manner in which a set of boys, debarred from the 
school " nine " by favoritism (as they aver), prove the 
fact to their comrades by beating the regular nine fairly 
and squarely. — Football is the interest back of Mr. 
Albertus T. Dudley's well-written " Following the 
Ball " (Lee & Shepard), a story of boarding school life 
and athletics. 

Among the children's books dealing with 
rtoruTorm historical subjects, special praise belongs 

. to Miss H. Twitchell's " Famous Chil- 

dren Who Have Gained Renown in the Fast " (Lee & 
Shepard). It combines a wealth of valuable informa- 
tion with matters of real interest to children, and its 

illustrations are taken from the masterpieces Flora 

Macdonald, the savior of the Young Pretender, is the 
heroine of " A Lassie of the Isles " (Lee & Shepard), 

an entertaining book by Miss Adele £. Thompson 

The North and South, Indians and whites, have their 
several interests represented in "Little Betty Blew: 
Her Strange Experiences and Adventures in Indian 
Land " (Lee & Shepard), by Miss Annie M. Barnes, 
in which a little Massachusetts girl removes to South 
Carolina in the earlier days of the settlement, and 
so brings into modern view a little-known chapter in 
colonial history. — The third volume of Mr. Edward 
Stratemeyer's " Colonial Series " is called " At the Fall 
of Montreal" (Lee & Shepard), and has Montcalm, 
Wolfe, and many another hero of the time, in its pages. 

— One of the better sort of books about the Revolution- 
ary struggle is Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth's " Brother 
Jonathan" (Appleton), a well-written biography of 
the Jonathan Trumbull who was so stanch a patriot 
throughout the struggle for American Independence. — 
"The Fifer Boy of the Boston Siege" (Jennings & 
Pye) is the subject of Mr. Edward A. Rand's well- 
realized account of the earlier period of the Revolution. 

— Dr. Everett T. Tomlinson covers the battles of the 
Brandy wine and of Germantown in " A Lieutenant 
under Washington " (Houghton), ending with Valley 
Forge. — " The Spy of Yorktown " (Appleton), by Mr. 
William O. Stoddard, carries the war of Independence 
through to a successful conclusion, and is a thrilling 

book After having kept reasonably quiet about the 

Mexican war for many years, three American authors 
now blossom out into books about it. It is too bad that 
not one of these three books has pointed out the rank 
injustice of this war, the more so that its evil effects 
upon civilization were never more apparent than now, 
when it is being used to justify other wicked wars of 
conquest. " The Giant of Three Wars " (Appleton) is 
a life of General Winfield Scott, the earlier chapters 
concerned with Scott's gallant part in the war of 1812 
and the final chapters with the war of the Rebellion, 
but the greater part of them filled with the tale of 
Scott's wonderful march from the Gulf to the City of 



Mexico. — "In the War with Mexico" (Scribner), 
by Dean Cyrus T. Brady, follows the fortunes of a mid- 
shipman who marches with Scott. — The invasion of 
Mexico from the north is discussed in Mr. William 
O. Stoddard's "Ahead of the Army" (Lothrop), its 
hero being a young American who acts as guide to the 
American armies at the beginning of the fighting. — 
Mr. Byron A. Dunn's "Raiding with Morgan" (Mc- 
Clurg) is the only boys' book of the year dealing with 
the war between the States. In it a number of char- 
acters familiar to the readers of the earlier books in the 
" Young Kentuckiaus " series reappear, and the writing 
of the narrative from the Southern point of view affords 
a desirable variety. — Captain F. S. Brereton takes the 
British and aristocratic view of the French Revolution 
in " The Red Cockade " (Scribner), which does not help 

it for American readers " In the Grip of the Mullah " 

(Scribner) is a better story in every way from the same 
pen, narrating what happened to a shipwrecked English 

officer after he fell into Moslem hands Two books

Tirah, and Ashanti" (Scribner). In it the British 
army is seen at its best, as usual. The other of Henty's 
books, "With the Allies to Pekin" (Scribner), also 
places the British in the van in that questionable inter- 
national competition. — Dr. Eva March Tappan's " In 
the Days of Queen Victoria" (Lee & Shepard) is a 
well-written and entertaining compendium of the reign 
just past, addressed particularly to the young, but use- 
ful to readers of any age. 

Not a large, but an instructive and enter- 
arimal'torie*. gaining, class of books deal with Nature 

in various forms, and with the animal 
world; their purpose being to impart to young people 
a feeling of sympathy for their fellow creatures. 
In Mr. Robert W. Chambers's " Orchard- Land " (Har- 
per) much information about the trees, flowers, birds, 
and insects, is woven into a pleasing and fanciful 
story. Mr. Birch's illustrations, in color and other- 
wise, are a charming feature of the book. — " The Lit- 
tle Foresters, a Story of Field and Woods" (Crowell) 
is made up of bird and animal tales by Mr. Clarence 

Hawkes, with pictures by Mr. Charles Copeland 

" Rover's Story, the Autobiography of a Calico Dog " 
(Lee & Shepard) is illustrated by photographs of 
the putative author, and other pictures done by Miss 
Helena Higginbotham, to prove the reality of the fine 
collie whose life the story chronicles. — " Jack the Fire 
Dog" (Little, Brown, & Co.) is a rattling good city 
story, by Mrs. Lily F. Wesselhoeft, with conviction and 

interest on every page Mrs. Gabrielle E. Jackson 

has written "Little Comrade, the Story of a Cat" 
(Taylor), which contains also three tales dealing with 
dogs of various degrees. These are good to read ; and 
so is another collection of seven animal stories, by the 
same author and publisher, " Big Jack, and Other True 
Stories of Horses." — Another animal autobiography is 
told by one of the inhabitants of the Mediterranean 
Sea, in "Lord Dolphin" (Estes), the work of Miss 
Harriet A. Cheever. It tells a great deal not gener- 
ally known about an interesting fellow-mammal. — 
Birds and insects play their parts in Mrs. Clara Dilling- 
ham Pierson's " Dooryard Stories " (Dutton), which 
have been admirably illustrated in color by Mr. F. C. 
Gordon " The Insect Folk" (Ginn) is both written

and illustrated by Miss Margaret Warner Morley, and 
it treats in an interesting way of dragon-flies, mos- 
quitoes, and the private life of several other insects we 

would quite as soon not have too near us " Ways of 

the Six- Footed" (Ginn) is by Mrs. Anna Botsford 
Comstock, with many pictures by the author and by 
Messrs. W. C. Baker and O. L. Foster. — Spiders of 
many sorts form the subject-matter of Miss Alice Jean 
Patterson's account, at once instructive and charming, 
of "The Spinner Family" (McClurg). Few books 
contain as much useful information in palatable form, 
and the numerous textual illustrations by Mr. Bruce 
Horsfall add conspicuously to its value. — " Jane and 
John, their Plays, Parties, and Picnics " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) is a pleasant story of children on a farm and at 
the sea-shore, in which a love for lower forms of life is 
insisted upon everywhere. — A new edition of Miss 
Effie Bignell's " Mr. Chupes and Miss Jenny " (Baker 
& Taylor) has been issued, a proper recognition of this 
interesting life story of two robins. 

Several new editions of old favorites, and

deserve a paragraph to themselves. Miss 
Eva March Tappan, Ph.D., has used the best resources 
of the skilful modern historian in telling " The Christ 
Story " (Houghton), following the career of the Saviour 
from the Annunciation to the Ascension, illuminating her 
narrative with stories from the Bible country. The book 

is well illustrated " Bible Stories for Young People " 

(Crowell) is a well-informed book by Mrs. Sarah E. 
Dawes, containing a simple and direct version of twenty- 
four incidents in biblical history, about equally divided 

between the Old and New Testaments In the series 

of " Children's Favorite Classics " (Crowell) appears 
" The Fables of iEsop," the text from the versions of 
L'Estrange and Croxall, edited by Mr. J. Walker 
McSpadden. It is a small and useful edition of an 
indispensable work. — " Jo's Boys," the sequel to Louisa 
M. Alcott's "Little Men," is sumptuously reprinted 
(Little, Brown, & Co.), with admirable pictures by 
Miss Ellen Wetherald Ahrens. — A book first published 
twenty years ago, " Six Girls," by Miss Fanny Belle 
Irving, justifies itself in its rehabilitation, being of 
more than average merit (Estes). — Mr. Thomas Nelson 
Page's pretty story of " Two Prisoners " is issued in a 
new edition (Russell), with colored illustrations by 
Miss Virginia Keep. In its present form this cheerful 
little tale will be read with delight not only by the 
children of to-day, but by those of a larger growth who 
recall its original publication in the pages of " Harper's 
Young People." — The "Uncle Charlie "who stands 
sponsor for the illustrated volume of " Childhood Clas- 
sics " (Laird & Lee) is no other than Mr. Charles Welsh, 
who has made the study and editing of children's litera- 
ture a life-work. So it may be taken for granted that 
this compilation of old tales and nursery rhymes is as 
good as experience and careful judgment can make it. 
— As part of the general " reading-made-easy " scheme 
of modern education, Mr. Frederic Lawrence Enowles 
is editing a sort of pre-digested series of books (Estes), 
in which, taking from the English classics as mnch about 
some hero's youth as he thinks a small child should 
know, he makes a little book for the young out of it. 
Two volumes of the sort appear this year, " The Story 
of Little David " from Dickens's " David Copperfield," 
and " The Story of Tom and Maggie " from George 
Eliot's " The Mill on the Floss." Both books are illus- 
trated. 



" Young Heroes of Wire and Rail " (Lee 

SEEST 1 & s^p*" 1 ) i8 b y. Mr - Alvah Milton 

Kerr, himself a train dispatcher, and it 
tells of the modest gallantry of railway men, proving 
when proof is hardly needed that peace too hath its 
victories. — Mr. Samuel Tra vers Clover devises a se- 
quel for an earlier work of merit in " On Special 
Assignment " (Lothrop), based on his own varied ex- 
periences in the newspaper business. It is a strong and 
faithful story, to be read by all youths of journalistic 

tendencies as a true picture of that life at its best 

"The Young Ice Whalers" (Houghton), by Mr. Win- 
throp Packard, is a tale of stormy seas and cloudy 
skies, reminding one of " Two Years before the Mast." 
Arctic Alaska is the scene of the adventures of two 
Yankee boys, and gold-mining and hunting, as well 
as whaling, appear in the pages. — In " Joe's Signal 
Code" (Lee & Shepard), Mr. W. Reiff Hesser gives 
his readers the benefit of his extensive knowledge of 
electrical subjects, and ends by having his hero and 
companions, cast away on a Pacific island, rescued by 
a most ingenious device. — "Joe, the Surveyor" (Lee 
& Shepard), the work of Mr. Edward Stratemeyer, 
describes the life of a country boy in " field-work " in 
the Alleghenies, and a rare bit of rascality unearthed 
through his watchfulness. — "Defending the Bank" 
(Lothrop), by Mr. Edward S. Van Zile, shows how two 
boys and a girl constitute themselves into a sort of pro- 
tective police and prevent a bank robbery. — Two boys 
of the most opposite point of view, one a believer in 
hard work and the other in luck, are contrasted in 
Mr. Edward S. Ellis's " True Blue, a Story of Luck 
and Pluck" (Estes). — "A Partnership in Magic" 
(Lothrop) is a sort of commercial fairy-story by Mr. 
Charles Battell Loomis, showing how easy it is to make 
money selling fruit when it is supplied free by super- 
natural means.

juvenile plebiscite, we feel rather safe 

in predicting a majority in favor of first place for Mrs. 
Edith Ogden Harrison's " The Star Fairies" (McClurg). 
Like the same writer's " Prince Silverwings " of last 
year, these new stories are of the old-fashioned sort 
dear to childish hearts. The colored illustrations by 
Mrs. Lucy F. Perkins are graceful to a marked degree. 
— A Christmas season without one of Mr. Andrew 
Lang's books of fairy tales would be but a dull affair. 
This year it is " The Crimson Fairy Book " (Long- 
mans), made up of some three dozen tales chosen, as 
in previous collections, from the folk-lore of all nations, 
and adapted and translated mainly by Mrs. Lang. 
Mr. H. J. Ford's illustrations, colored and otherwise, 
are hardly equalled in artistic quality by those in any 

other children's book of the year " Algonquin Indian 

Tales " (Jennings & Pye), by Mr. Edgerton Ryerson 
Young, is a collection of fairy stories and aboriginal 
traditions, some of which were used by Longfellow in 
" Hiawatha." — Mr. Everett McNeill's " Dickon Bend- 
the-Bow, and Other Wonder Tales" (Saalfield) has 
thirteen stories of more than average merit, their inten- 
tion admirably borne out by Mr. Rob Wagner's pic- 
tures in color. — "The Magic Forest" (Macmillan) 
is a fairy tale in both the inception and the telling, in 
which Mr. Stewart Edward White follows the fortunes 
of a little sleep-walking boy, who leaves the train on 
which his parents are, is picked up by Indians in the 
Northwestern fur trade, and lives an enchanted life

among them for half a year. It is an excellent book. 
— Original stories of admirable quality appear in M The 
Giant's Ruby, and Other Fairy Tales " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.), by Mrs. Mabel Fuller Blodgett, with illustra- 
tions by Miss Katherine Pyle. This is Mrs. Blodgett's 
third book of the kind, and her touch grows firmer 
with each succeeding effort. — A book of merit, filling 
a place hitherto vacant in contemporary literature, is 
Miss Netta Syrett's " Six Fairy Plays for Children " 
(Lane). Intended for production in the school or at 
home, with numerous characters in some of the plays 
and very few in others, and all well contrived, this 
book will be a valuable acquisition to the children's 
library. — " The Golden Windows, a Book of Fables 
for Old and Young " (Little, Brown, & Co.) is Mrs. 
Laura £. Richards's pleasant collection of stories of 
many kinds, enchantments and talking animals finding 
their wonted place, with a not too obtrusive moral be- 
hind each story. — " Maisie and her Dog Snip in Fairy- 
land " (Harper) is a pretty story of a little girl who 
learns a number of valuable things in one short excur- 
sion. — A translation of merit has been made by Mrs. 
M. Cary, and its result bears the title of " Fairy Legends 
of the French Provinces" (Crowell). The stories are 
familiar in variant forms in most cases, but they read- 
ily bear repetition. — Granted an old Virginia manor 
house with its collection of traditions coming down from 
colonial days, and visitors who leave good stories to be 
remembered, while the colored people on their part 
bring tales well worth hearing, and there results such 
a volume as Miss Honor Walsh's "The Story-Book 
House " (Estes), a book worth the while of almost any- 
body, old or young. — Legends of many sorts, all with 
a supernatural suggestion, make up the contents of 
" Elizabeth's Charm-String " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
by Miss Cora B. Forbes. Saints have much to do with 
the book, and it is " moral " accordingly. — Mrs. Edith 
Rebecca Bolster sends her small heroine into an en- 
chanted forest, in " Ethel in Fairyland " (Lothrop), 
bringing her back a happier and a wiser girl " Twi- 
light Tales Told to Tiny Tots" (Crowell) is Miss 
Anita D. Rosecrans's combination of old and new fairy 
stories and stories of adventure, adapted to the intelli- 
gence of the very small Mr. Ray M. Steward has 

written, and Miss Laura J. Bridgman illustrated, a 
book with a self-explanatory title, in full as follows: 
« The Surprising Adventures of the Man in the Moon, 
Showing How, in Company with Santa Claus, Robinson 
Crusoe, Cinderella and Her Prince, Jack the Giant 
Killer, Little Red Riding Hood, Old Mother Hubbard, 
Jack Spratt and His Wife, Tommy Tucker, and Some 
Others, He Made a Remarkable Tour over Land and 

Sea and through the Air " (Lee & Shepard) " The 

Truth about Santa Claus " (Crowell) is Mrs. Charlotte 
M. Vaile's account of the good St. Nicholas, by which 
a waning faith in the legendary saint can be supplied 
with something better, the belief in a fine reality. — 
Two really clever books have been devised by Mr. 
Neville Cain and published as "The Fairies' Mena- 
gerie " and « The Fairies' Circus " (Russell), the latter 
a volume, as the author writes, " where elves and 
sprites with one another vie in feats of most unique 
agility." — The new edition of Mr. William Dana Or- 
cutt's "The Princess Kallisto" (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
with its attractive drawings by Miss Harriette Amsden, 
serves to renew the interest and educational usefulness 
of these charming fairy tales. — " The Wonderful Elec- 
tric Elephant" (Saalfield) tells of a marvellous bit 



For girls 
especially, 



of rapid-travelling mechanism in the form of an ele- 
phant, in which Mrs. Frances Trego Montgomery's 
pleasant party makes an interesting tour of various 
foreign parts. 

For girls of the larger or older sort, 
there are not many new books in com- 
parison with former years. "The Bea- 
trice Book " (Lane), by Mr. Ralph Harold Bretherton, 
shows what may happen to a sweet and loving woman 
when her children weigh too heavily upon her, and it 
can be read to best advantage by worrying mothers to 
worried children. — "New Fortunes: How Molly and 
her Brothers Came to Boulder Gulch" (Barnes) is 
two-thirds Molly as Miss Mabel Earle writes it, and 
shows what a smart young girl can do in the way of 
civilizing a mining-camp. — Of more than usual inter- 
est, and with a really unusual theme, Mrs. Mary Mc- 
Crae Culter's " The Girl Who Kept Up " (Lee & Shep- 
ard) tells of a grown girl who does not let her youthful 
lover's departure for college, when her high school days 
are over, interfere with her own intellectual devel- 
opment. — " Ursula's Freshman " (Little, Brown, & 
Co.), Miss Anna Chapin Ray's sequel to her earlier 
" Nathalie's Chum," is one of the increasing number 
of stories that recognize the growing feeling of class in 
the United States. The heroine is an Iowa girl resi- 
dent in New York, and her freshman is a rich young 
fellow whom she persuades into doing something, 
after his money is gone. — "A Daughter of the Rich " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.) is another of the same sort; 
but in this, the author, Miss M. E. Waller, reverses 
the situation by having the sickly daughter of a New 
York millionaire visiting in a sturdy Vermont family. 

— Col. Prentiss Ingraham, after acting as escort to a 
party of young women on a long ride across the plains, 
makes a book of it with the title " The Girl Rough 
Riders" (Estes), having in it a great deal about the 
Grand Canon of the Colorado, and other interesting 

things " Sophie May" (Miss Rebecca Sophia Clarke) 

has another of the stories her girl readers love so 
dearly, in " Joy Bells, a Story of Quinnebasset " (Lee & 
Shepard), the scene being laid half a century ago, and 
many of the characters in other Quinnebasset stories 
reappearing here. — Four school-girls, driven from a 
vacation at home by illness in their families, spend their 
leisure in an old farm-house not far from the school; 
and their interesting experiences there, with an older 
cousin who acts as mentor, are well told by Miss Annie 
H. Donnell, in " Camp Fidelity Girls " (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) — "Miss Frances Charles's "The Awakening 
of the Duchess " (Little, Brown, & Co.) is a book for 
nearly every age, telling of a mother given to all sorts 
of charities and public enterprises, who is brought to 
a realization of closer duties by her neglected little 
daughter. — The popularity of the work of Miss 
Amanda M. Douglas will not suffer through her latest 
book, " Helen Grant's Schooldays " (Lee & Shepard). 
It tells of a young girl brought into a broader life by a 
kindly woman, boarding-school life occupying much of 
the story. — A youthful school-teacher obtains the 
privilege of educating her younger sister in lieu of an 
increase in salary; and what ensues is told by Mrs. 
Gabrielle E. Jackson in " Three Graces " (Appleton). 

— The fourth and last volume in an interesting series 
is Miss Helen Leah Reed's " Brenda's Bargain " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.), which is one of the first books 
written for young girls dealing with social-settlement 
work, and is unusually well worth reading.

THE DIAL,

There are not many books for small boys 
For ***" 6<,3 ' , or small girls separately this year, nearly 

all being directed generally to children 
of both sexes. A large proportion of tbem have been 
written by women, however, and this gives them more 
of a feminine than masculine aspect. Miss Evelyn 
Whitaker, for instance, in " Gay " (Little, Brown, & 
Co.), has made a good story about the little son of the 
widow of an officer born of wealthy people, his parents' 

marriage having been a secret one So in ■ Blake 

Redding, a Boy of To-Day " (Little, Brown, & Co.), 
Miss Natalie Rice Clark has quite as many girls as 

boys concerned in the progress of the story " The 

Children Who Ran Away " (Macmillan), in Miss Evelyn 
Sharp's story of that name, are a fourteen-year-old girl 
and her little brother, the account of their mild adven- 
tures and what came of them making very good read- 
ing. — Small boys and small girls keep " How the Two 
Ends Met" (Crowell) just about even, the two ends 
being those of a city block. The story, which is by Miss 
Mary F. Leonard, bas a sociological suggestion, rich and 
poor coming to a better understanding of one another. 

— This is even more true of " Children of the Tene- 
ments " (Macmillan), a collection of episodes written 
by Mr. Jacob A. Riis out of his full experience. It is 
a valuable book, without literary pretension, but none 
the poorer for that " Sheba " (Crowell) is of some- 
what the same sort, Miss Anna Chapin Ray taking 
some little Jewish children and their homely lives for 
her story, which has the effective commendation of Mr. 
Riis. — "Little Dick's Christmas" (Estes) is a happy 
little story of an old-fashioned sort, by Miss Etheldred 
B. Barry, in which a small boy gives up his own presents 
to those more needy, and through this is able to recon- 
cile his grandfather and his parents as well as to settle 
a strike that had made the village poor. — Miss Amy 
Le Feuvre has written two small books with a strong 
flavor of religion in them (Revell), one, " Two Tramps," 
telling of the adventures of a small nephew and his uncle 
while rambling over the beautiful English countryside 
in search of health; and the other, "Jill's Red Bag," 
of a family of small orphans left in an elder sister's 
care and brought into a better spiritual condition 
through the efforts of a wise and pious governess. — 
Some good short stories of the poor as well as of 
the well-to-do may be found in Mrs. Kate Dickinson 
Sweetser's "Micky of the Alley" (Appleton). — Not 
at all the people she expected to find, but exactly the 
sort of people she needed to find, greet the small 
heroine of " Winifred's Neighbors" (Lee & Shepard). 
Miss Bertha 6. Davidson has made the story interesting 

beyond most of its kind Twins with good names, 

Theodore and Dorothea, spend a vacation in a jolly 
little country town, and descriptions of the good times 
they have together crowd the pages of Miss Marion A. 

Taggart's "At Aunt Anna's " (Appleton) " Dorothy's 

Playmates " (Lee & Shepard) is the sequel to Miss 
Amy Brooks's " Dorothy Dainty " of a year ago, with 
three small aristocrats and a child of the poor in the 

story A waif and stray is also in Miss Harriet A. 

Cheever's " Gipsy Jane " (Estes), and her time is 
divided between the rambling life that had been her 
mother's and the ordered existence of a rich English 
home. — Two brothers and two sisters are the leading 
characters of " The Frolicsome Four " (Lee & Shepard), 
and they have good times and bad times, after the 
fashion of children, with the good times predominating. 

— Sent all the way across a continent to an uncle in 



Baltimore, the little maid in " The Mislaid Uncle " 
(Crowell) comes upon the wrong man, but finds him a 
charming fellow just the same, as the story shows. — 
The fourth of Miss Amy Brooks's " Randy " books 
is " Randy and Prue " (Lee & Shepard), a pleasant 
story. 

For little readers there remain a num- 

%**'£%!?' ber of book8 ' most of them with verees 

and jingles attached, and all with pic- 
tures in quantities. An anonymous work, " Peter 
Piper's Practical Principles of Plain and Perfect Pro- 
nunciation" (Scott-Thaw Co.), contains enough allitera- 
tive lilts of the " Peter Piper " and " Theophilus 
Thistle " sort to fix the letters forever in the youthful 
mind. — Mr. Oscar von Gottschalk imparts information 
concerning cotton, sugar, tobacco, oil, lumber, and other 
essentials, in his " Innocent Industries; or, Kindergar- 
ten Tales for Industrious Infants" (Russell) . — " Jungle 
Larks " (Laird & Lee), by Mr. Raymond H. Garman, is 
an amusing portfolio of pictures in which the birds and 
beasts of Africa disport themselves in human fashion, 
and make no bad satire on human ways. — " More Five 
Minute Stories" (Estes), by Mrs. Laura E. Richards, 
comes out in response to the demand awakened a year 
ago for more of these pretty stories in prose and verse, 
just what children enjoy again and again. — Miss Ger- 
trude Smith has done another book in the fashion of 
the " Roggie and Reggie " book of several years ago, 
"The Stories of Peter and Ellen" (Harper). It is 
fully illustrated in color by Miss E. Mars and Miss M. 

H. Squire Mrs. Frances Trego Montgomery has a 

more instructive if less humorous tale in her sequel, 
"Billy Whiskers' Kids " (Saalfield), than in the orig- 
inal " Billy Whiskers " of a year ago. The two little 
goats go on shipboard, and the reader travels with them 
on their adventurous voyage. — Always clever and often 
touching, Mr. George V. Hobart has written " Li'l 
Verses for Li'l Fellers " (Russell), the Misses Mars 
and Squire providing sympathetic illustrations — Verses 
by Miss Margaret Page and pictures by Mrs. Katharine 
W. Greenland make up the enticing pages of " In 
Childhood Land" (Saalfield). — Miss Myrtle Reed as 
rhymester, Mr. Ike Morgan as illustrator, and Mrs. 
Eva Cruzen Hart as composer, have combined to make 
" Pickaback Songs " (Putnam) a most interesting con- 
tribution to child-song. — The ninth volume of com- 
bined pictures and verses concerning the delectable 
Golliwogg, the pictures by Miss Florence K. Upton and 
the verees by Miss Bertha Upton, appears as "The 
Golli wogg's Circus " (Longmans), with all the familiar 

accessories of old A sort of Little Red Riding Hood 

story reversed is told by " Joe Kerr " in " Mr. Sharp- 
tooth " (Dillingham), a book abounding in colored plates. 
— No better presents have been designed this season 
for small folk than " Denslow's Picture Books for Chil- 
dren " (Dillingham), twelve paper-covered booklets in 
the newest and best manner of Mr. William Wallace 
Denslow, comprising "The ABC Book," "One Ring

Mother Hubbard," "Jack and the Bean Stalk," "The 
Visit to the Zoo," " The House that Jack Built," " The 
Three Bears," " Little Red Riding Hood," " Five Little 
Pigs," and " Mary's Lamb." — The ever-welcome 
"Chatterbox for 1904" (Estes), and the perennial 
" Sunday Reading for the Young, 1904 " (Nelson), 
must not be left without a word of welcome. Each 
volume contains the usual generous store of text and 
pictures.

Notes. 



Bede's "Ecclesiastical History" in Doctor Giles's 
translation of 1840, is the latest "Temple Classic," 
published by the Macmillan Co. 

Charles Kingsley's " Hypatia," in two volumes, is 
added to the new library edition of that author's writings 
in course of publication by Messrs. J. F. Taylor & Co. 
A selection from the poems of Tennyson, edited by 
the Rev. Henry van Dyke and Mr. D. Laurence 
Chambers, is a new volume in the " Athenaeum Press 
Series " of Messrs. Ginn & Co. The selection is judi- 
cious, covers the poet's entire development, and has an 
extensive apparatus of notes. 

We have received from the Messrs. Appleton " The 
Prisoner of Zenda " and " Quisante'," being the first two 
volumes of a new library edition of the novels of 
" Anthony Hope." Fifteen volumes will complete the 
set, and the edition is limited. In mechanical execution 
this edition is a counterpart of the edition of Dr. Conan 
Doyle's novels, recently mentioned by us as coming from 
the same publishers. 

The " Puritan " edition of Bunyan's " Pilgrim's Prog- 
ress," published by the Fleming H. Revell Co., has for 
its special feature a series of thirty-one illustrations, by 
Mr. Harold Copping, which represent the characters in 
the costumes of Bunyan's time. The text, also, has 
been the subject of a careful editorial treatment, and is 
given as nearly as possible in the shape finally authorized 
by the author's own revisions and corrections. 

The " Denmark, Norway, and Sweden " of Mr. Will- 
iam Eleroy Curtis, sent us by the Saalfield Publishing 
Co., is a reprint of the author's recent newspaper corre- 
spondence from the three Scandinavian countries. The 
work is rambling and far from accurate, but it makes 
fairly interesting reading, and is written from a stand- 
point of genuine sympathy and admiration. There are 
nearly a hundred full-page photographic illustrations, 
which constitute perhaps the most attractive feature of 
the volume. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. continue their ad- 
mirable work of republishing, in agreeable, but inexpen- 
sive form, the standard productions of English literature. 
Their most important enterprise of this sort for the 
present year takes the shape of companion sets, in twelve 
volumes each, of the works of Fielding and Smollett. 
In the case of Fielding, we have the works nearly com- 
plete — novels, essays, dramas, and miscellanies — while 
in the case of Smollett we have the five novels alone. 
Both sets are edited by Dr. Gustavus Howard Mayna- 
dier, and are illustrated in photogravure. 

The favor accorded Messrs. Laird & Lee's "New 
Standard Dictionary " has led to the publication of a new 
library edition of the work. For those seeking an inex- 
pensive lexicon of compact dimensions, this one offers 
several points of desirability. It contains nearly all 
words in general use, with a considerable number appear- 
ing now for the first time in a dictionary. The defi- 
nitions, while short, seem to be sufficiently explicit. 
Biographical and geographical dictionaries, with much 
other useful matter of the same sort, are contained in 
an Appendix. A special feature of interest, not usually 
found in similar works, is the series of colored plates, 
eleven in all. In addition, there are hundreds of draw- 
ings in the text and a number of full-page illustrations. 
The volume is neatly bound in half leather, and provided 
with a thumb index.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
of SEVENTY YEARS 




' • Indeed, so packed is it 
with memorable things 
that the reviewer, se- 
lecting here and there a 
chapter or a passage for 
special notice, feels like 
one gathering pebbles 
on the seashore/ * 

— The Dial. 



"A book which, considered as, a contribution to 
the materials of American history, will rank with 
Benton's 'Thirty Years in the U. S. Senate' and 
Blaine's 'Twenty Years in Congress,' is the Auto- 
biography of Seventy Years, by George F. Hoar. 
From one point of view the narrative is decidedly 
superior to either of the works with which we have 
compared it. The author is not only a statesman 
but also a scholar and a man of letters. It may be 
doubted whether any citizen who has played for an 
equal length of time an important part in American 
politics has possessed in an equal measure the gifts 
and the attainments that make an accomplished 
writer." — New York Sun. 



"Senator Hoar's sense 
of humor is keen and his 
book is illuminated con- 
stantly with flashes of 
fun that relieve its more 
solid qualities. It is a 
dignified, optimistic, 
entertaining, and inspir- 
ing record of a long and 
useful life." — Chicago 
Record-Herald.

A NORTHERN OPINION : 

" There is not a page in the book which bears the 
stamp of prejudice, not a sentiment which can 
offend any honest man. It is a big, brainy, full- 
blooded, manly American story, passionately 
thrilled with a high spirit of American hopeful- 
ness." — St. Paul Dispatch.

" His battle scenes are living pictures} his com- 
pact force of statement is remarkable."

" His abounding good-will to all sections of the

The Story of a Soldier's Life 

By Field Marshal VISCOUNT WOLSELEY 

Two volumes, with portraits and plans. Price, $8.00 net. 



Some of the Events in the Career of 
Lord Wolseley 

The Burmese War of 1852-3. 

The Crimean War. 

The Great Mutiny and the Relief of Lucknow. 

The Oudh Campaign under Sir Hope Grant. 

The Chinese War of i860 

Sir Hope Grant's Expedition to Japan. 

The Mission to the Tai-Ping Rebels in China. 

The Expedition to Canada to watch the American War. 

The Visit to the Southern Confederacy. 

Fenian Campaigns to Niagara and the Welland Canal. 

The Riel Rebellion. 

The Reformation of the War Office, London. 

The Ashantee War. 



""THIS soldier's life story, told by himself, is not only 
1 a work of much historic value, but a stirring tale 
as well — a piece of martial autobiography of very 
genuine interest. It is the sort of book, in a word, 
that interests a man because he is a man, wholly apart 
from whether he is also a student or a lover of history. 
Lord Wolseley was Field Marshal because he was 
first a soldier and won his promotions by fighting for 
them. Once, during the Great Mutiny, wearied in 
battle, he slept soundly over night among the dead in 
the field. It was he who led the advance in Colin 
Campbell's relief of Lucknow. It was he who 
stormed the Toka forts in the Chinese war of i860. 
He put down the Riel Rebellion after a march of 
800 miles through the Canadian wilderness. He 
conducted the Ashantee war. 



Central Asia and Tibet Toward the Holy City of Lassa 

By SVEN HEDIN 

With 8 illustrations in color, 16 drawings by distinguished artists, 400 photographs and 
4 maps. Two volumes, large 8vo, $10.50 net. 

""PHIS book, one of the most important works of exploration and discovery for many years, is the first adequate 
* description of Dr. HedhVs remarkable expedition and its accomplishments, an expedition so rich in adventure, 
as well as solid achievement, that he has been called, by the London press, "the modern knight-errant of 
science." The work has, in fact, much of the quality of a tale of adventure, while it embodies scientific facts 
and investigations of the utmost importance, including Prof. Himly's readings of the ancient MSS. discovered.

TEE HERD ER C ENTENARY. 

On the eighteenth of the present month, it 
will be one hundred years since Johann Gott- 
fried Herder died at Weimar. The German 
Department of the Northwestern University 
has arranged for that date a memorial celebra- 
tion for the purpose of calling renewed attention 
to the intellectual services of that great thinker 
as well as to the singular elevation of the char- 
acter which gave to those services a heightened 
impressiveness. It is well that we should thus 
recall the memory of the distinguished dead, 
and the centennial pretext, although obviously 
an artificial one, is as good for that purpose as 
another. It is particularly well that we should 
recall the memory of Herder, for he belongs to 
the class of men whose work, while profoundly 
influential upon the thought of the age, becomes 
in time so mingled with the general intellectual 
current that its special identity ceases for the

general consciousness, and is to be restored or 
recreated only by the student of literary history 
who takes a plunge into the past for that par- 
ticular purpose. 

The fame of some men is sufficiently pre- 
served in their own works, while the fame of 
others is preserved, largely at least, in the 
reflection of their influence from minds to which 
they proved an inspiration. We still read 
Goethe and Schiller and Lessing for the sake of 
their genius as embodied in the masterpieces of 
their creation ; the writings of Herder, on the 
other hand, are left undisturbed to collect dust 
upon our shelves, and even the professed student 
of German literature will in many instances be 
compelled to admit that his chief impression of 
that profound thinker comes from the associa- 
tion with Goethe when both were young men at 
Strassburg. 

It is indeed fortunate for Herder's memory 
that in his youth he was thrown for a year 
into the still more youthful companionship of 
Goethe. We turn over and over again to the 
Strassburg pages in " Dichtung und Wahrheit " 
chiefly, no doubt, to read of the idyl of Sesen- 
heim ; but the second feature of interest in 
those pages is provided by the poet's confession 
of his indebtedness to the literary critic and 
philosophical historian who came into his life 
at just the psychological moment when the 
ferment of his ideas was ready for clarification, 
and when he was seeking to set in order the 
house of his intellect. 

" Because his talk was always significant, whether he 
questioned, answered, or communicated himself in some 
other fashion, he spurred me daily, and even hourly, on 
to new views. . . . The more eagerly I received, the 
more generously he gave, so that the hours we spent 
together were of the most interesting sort." 

Throughout Goethe's career we find abundant 
evidence of the fructifying influence of this 
early association with the philosophical critic, 
we find it in his broader outlook, in his rigor- 
ous standards of appreciation, and in his 
constant striving toward the largest possible 
synthesis of the facts of nature and human life 
as presented by direct observation and the 
examination of the past. 

The history of culture offers no more inter- 
esting field of study than that of the transition 
from eighteenth to nineteenth century modes of 
thought. The eighteenth century was arti- 
ficial ; its successor became natural. Rous- 
seau's appeal to men to get back into natural 
ways of thinking and living seems to us now 
even more significant than it did when it was 
made over a hundred years ago, for the trans- 



formation of which his activities concerned 
only particular phases is now perceived to have 
been farther-reaching than the compass of all 
his dreams. The world into which Herder was 
born was crystallized by tradition and prescrip- 
tion. Its life was one of convention, its scholar- 
ship was lacking in philosophical breadth, its 
whole fashion of thought was trammelled by 
an artificial method from which even the mighty 
intellect of Kant could not shake itself free. 
Literature was judged by artificial canons, 
history was envisaged without perspective, and 
religion was conceived as a formulary. How 
clearly do all these limitations confront us in 
the work of Voltaire, the typical master-mind 
of the eighteenth century, who for all his wit, 
and lucidity, and amazing energy, has an im- 
portance in the history of intellectual develop- 
ment that falls far short of what seemed to be 
his measure to the age in which he made so 
great a stir. 

Herder was nearly enough the contemporary 
of Voltaire to justify a comparison between the 
two men, and in a certain sense the compara- 
tively obscure German pastor outranks the 
brilliant French worldling whose intellectual 
dictatorship hardly brooked a rival. We should 
be the last to underate the magnificent services 
done for humanity by Voltaire in his crusade 
against superstition and injustice, but he does 
not belong to the class of constructive thinkers 
who constitute the links in the chain of intel- 
lectual progress. Even when his cause was 
entirely just, he was battling for ideals as old 
as human thinking; his face was turned toward 
the past, and he had no " Vision of the world 
and all the wonder that would be " when the 
men of a later time should set resolutely about 
the task of reconstructing the fabric of know- 
ledge upon the firm foundations of first-hand 
observation and logical method combined. 
Herder, on the other hand, possessed a sin- 
gular insight into the underlying and sub- 
conscious processes that were shaping the 
intellectual development of the future ; his ideas 
were germinal where they were not absolutely 
constructive, and he made all the coming gen- 
erations his debtor. We may not now read 
his writings, but his thought has become so 
fully our possession that we are in danger of 
forgetting that it ever was his thought alone, 
imposed upon a reluctant age, and made ours 
through the mediation of Goethe and many 
lesser men. 

" Herder gave the initiative in all directions," 
says Scherer, " in history, philology, and liter-

ary criticism." In his character as a Lutheran 
clergyman, his inflaence on religious thought 
was marked, and he so outgrew the pietism and 
narrow orthodoxy of his earlier years that he 
ended in a modified acceptance of the philos- 
ophy of Spinoza, and in the conviction that 
** theology is a liberal study, and requires no 
slavishness of soul." In a word, he fore- 
shadowed the higher criticism of the Scriptures, 
and more than foreshadowed their modern 
natural interpretation as works of literature. 
As a student of the creative writing of all ages 
and races he prepared the way for that spirit of 
cosmopolitanism in appreciation and compari- 
son which is in our own time bearing rich fruit, 
and he pointed the way to that conception of 
world-literature which has ever since held the 
imagination of far-seeing thinkers. He was 
also one of the pioneers in the modern move- 
ment which has made of literary criticism much 
more than a matter of judgment by fixed rules 
or of rhetorical analysis, and which demands 
of the critic that he shall be the natural his- 
torian of literature, taking into account all of 
the conditions under which work is produced, 
and occupying the point of view of the men by 
whom it was written. In his unfinished yet 
monumental treatise on the philosophy of his- 
tory, he developed a grandiose conception of 
the scheme of the development of civilization, 
and of the underlying unity in the annals of 
mankind. 

The man of whom these things, and many 
more of like import, may be said is one who 
deserves well of his posterity, and in this year 
of the special remembrance of his achievements 
it is not without profit to ourselves that we turn 
to his own pages, and learn from them directly 
something of the obligation of the modern world 
to his teaching. There are few writers of his 
century with whom we have so much in com- 
mon, or whose books we may read with less of 
the feeling that their message has been long 
outworn, and that they offer standpoints be- 
yond which we have far advanced. If Herder 
fails of his due effect upon the student of to- 
day, it is not because his essential ideas have 
grown antiquated, but rather because they have 
won such general acceptance, and become so 
incorporated into the very fibre of our minds, 
that they seem to us commonplaces of thought, 
and can no longer appeal to us with the preg- 
nancy of meaning that was theirs when they 
flowed directly from the springs of his intel- 
lectual being, and were charged with the vital- 
ity of his impressive personality. 



THE ILLUSTRATING OF CHILDREN'S 
BOOKS. 



On a shelf in my library is an old volume, now 
yellow and dog-eared, which was a treasure of my 
grandmother's girlhood. It was one of the few 
picture-books vouchsafed the children of a century 
ago. I regard it with more than a book-lover's affec- 
tion, and am constrained to look at it when at all 
pessimistic about the juvenile books which are being 
put forth by the publishers of to-day ; for it empha- 
sizes, as nothing else can, the development in the art 
of making books for children, and teaches us to be 
thankful for what the young people of the present 
generation have escaped. 

This volume is " A Xew Hieroglyphical Bible for 
the Amusement and Instruction of Children ; Being 
a Selection of the most useful Lessons and most 
interesting Narratives, Scripturally Arranged, from 
Genesis to the Revelation, Embellished with Famil- 
iar Figures and Striking Emblems Elegantly En- 
graved. . . . Recommended by the Rev'd Rowland 
Hill, M.A. Xew York : Printed for and Published 
by the Booksellers. MDCCXCYI." The Preface 
further informs us that the author's object is " to 
imprint on the Memory of Youth by lively and 
sensible images the sacred and important truths of 
Holy Writ," and that *• the utmost attention has 
been paid to select such passages for illustration and 
embellishment as contained truths the most obvious 
and important or historical facts the most interest- 
ing." Turning over the leaves, we find one of the 
first i; obvious and important truths " to be the fol- 
lowing, labelled Exodus xxxrx, 28, — without a 
suggestion of context : u And a Mitre of fine linen, 
and goodly Bonnets of fine linen and linen Breeches 
of fine twined linen." The " striking emblems ele- 
gantly engraved " consist of an episcopal mitre, two 
sunbonnets, and a pair of boy's trousers. — the 
pictures taking the place of the words which they 
are supposed to represent, and thus forming a sort 
of illustrated rebus to attract and interest the 
young. 

Contemporary with this stimulating volume was 
the well-known " Xew England Primer." with its 
crude representation of Adam's Fall, and its mildly 
exciting picture of Mr. John Rogers being consumed 
at Smithfield, with a cheerful smile upon his face, 
and ; ' His Wife with nine small Children & one at 
her Breast following him to the Stake." 

The period which gave to the children of America 
the " Hieroglyphical Bible " and the "Xew England 
Primer " did not recognize the humorous or the 
fanciful as in any sense legitimate matter for the 
young, though the children's books of that epoch 
appeal to us of to-day with a humor that is quite irre- 
sistible. A child's book was then a serious matter, 
and mere amusement was an end at which it seldom 
aimed. The child was considered quite able to 
amuse himself without assistance, and the proper 
function of the book was to instruct, correct, and 



458

admonish. As the " New England Primer " had it : 
" Thy Life to mend, This hook attend." 

Turning from the juvenile volumes of the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century to those of to-day 
is like passing from a darkened room out into the 
sunshine. Illustrating is now a distinct art, and 
illustrating for children is an important branch of 
it. Some of the best artists of the present genera- 
tion have devoted their lives to the service of the 
child ; and the function of illustrating has risen 
from merely embellishing the text to really inter- 
preting it. We sometimes speak of the illustrations 
of a book, in connection with its typography and 
binding, as its " mechanical features "; but this 
characterization is not as often made as formerly, 
and should not be made at all. The pictures of a 
child's book are an organic part of it. They are as 
much to the child as is the text, — often more than 
the text, — and determine in many cases his literary 
likes and dislikes. The interpretation which the 
artist gives to Cinderella may decide whether she is 
to be admired or only pitied, and Robinson Crusoe 
may be made an altogether kind and friendly per- 
son or a frightful semi-savage. This influence is, 
of course, especially strong in the case of the very 
young. A picture is the simplest and most ele- 
mentary expression of an idea. It precedes written 
language. The savage read his primitive stories in 
picture-writing, before his descendants learned the 
use of letters ; and as the childhood of the individual 
is a counterpart of the childhood of the race, the 
child to-day gets his story also from the picture, 
before the text is open to him. 

If we grant the importance of pictures in fixing 
the child's impressions and forming his tastes, we 
must see to it that he has good pictures, — pictures 
that, first of all, will attract him ; for if they do not 
attract they will not influence him, unless it be neg- 
atively. Then, while they attract they must also 
cultivate his ideals of beauty and his appreciation 
of art, — for how is he to learn what good art is un- 
less it is often before him? And, finally, while it 
is not the function of children's pictures, as it is not 
the function of art in the large, to teach morality, 
they should teach nothing that is low, cruel, or de- 
basing. 

Having stated, then, as the first requisite of good 
juvenile pictures that they must attract the child, 
the question arises, What sort of picture does the 
child prefer ? This is not easily answered. I have 
experimented with children in different grades of 
the public schools, and with others who have never 
attended school. The experiment has shown that 
the tastes of children vary almost as much as those 
of adults, and that they change as the child de- 
velops. There are, however, several well-defined 
likes that belong to every normal child. 

The child likes color. The normal untrained 
child likes bright color. A red hat attracts the 
infant, while a black hat does not. But as the child 
grows, he comes to see beauty also in subdued tones, 



and his training helps him to do this. He should 
never be taught, however, to despise pure bright 
color. The love of it is the natural heritage of the 
child, and he never outgrows it. All that we need 
concern ourselves about is to show him the beauty 
of harmonious combinations, and he will soon come 
to dislike those that are inharmonious. 

Again, the child naturally likes a broad, simple 
treatment, whether in color or in black-and-white. 
This fondness for simplicity is somewhat modified, 
as the child grows older, by an interest in detail - r 
but it may safely be affirmed that a child of two 
years or less does not want detail in a picture. He 
wants only a distinct impression. My little girl at 
the age of two preferred a series of simple outline 
drawings in a " First Reader " to all her other pic- 
tures. There was a cat which she could see at a 
glance, and a cup which she instantly recognized as 
a familiar friend. This stage was passed in due 
season, and she began to show interest in a cat with 
a bell around its neck, and a cup with figures on it ; 
but it was not until the perceptive faculties had 
developed that the love of detail came to her, and 
even when it did come it did not supplant the fond- 
ness for simple treatment and clear images. It does 
not do this in any normal child. 

The tendency of modern illustrators is to go back 
to the antique. The child is confronted with archaic 
line-drawings suggestive of Dttrer and the early 
German wood-engravers. All the life and dramatic 
interest of a situation are conventionalized out 
of it, and the dead remains are set forth in faded 
colors with a decorative framework of historic or- 
nament. Mr. Walter Crane is perhaps the best- 
known exponent of this style. Mr. Howard Pyle, 
in his later work, seems also to have adopted it, 
though he mingles with it the poster style, which 
is even more conventional, and at least equally 
objectionable. 

The poster style seems to be borrowed from the 
Japanese. It has some elements that appeal to 
children. It may, from one point of view, be re- 
garded as the child's own method of expressing his 
ideas of form, as he draws his outline with a pencil 
and fills it in with the colors from his paint-box. 
But it is adapted only to the simplest subjects, and the 
average modern artist makes a mistake in trying 
to show by means of it all the details of a complex 
story. He gives us a background of distant trees 
which have no distance at all, but in which the 
figures of his foreground seem to be hopelessly 
entangled. This idea of ignoring perspective and 
making objects at a dozen different distances all 
appear to be in a single plane, after the Japanese 
fashion, is entirely vicious. It is an affectation, 
which copies the faults quite as servilely as the 
merits of the method it affects. Another manifes- 
tation of this conventional insanity is seen in con- 
centric spirals of hair and beard, and in hard ellip- 
soid clouds lying on a sky of parallel lines. Now, 
a child does not want to see his Crusoe or his Sinbad 



1903.] 



THE DIAL,

stiffened into a knave of spades. He does not care 
for the decorative. What he wants is life. 

A boy of eight made a fair criticism on one of 
these crowded, flat, ultra-conventional illustrations, 
when he gave as his reason for not liking it that it 
was "all muggled up." The illustration was one 
of Mr. Charles Robinson's, but was in that artist's 
most involved and chaotic manner. No modern 
illustrator perhaps possesses more sympathy with 
children, or can make more delightfully attractive 
figures of little folks when he keeps to the simple 
treatment ; but he often attempts more than the 
method which he has chosen will allow. What is 
true of Mr. Robinson is true also of Mr. Crane, Mr. 
Pyle, Mr. Heywood Sumner, the Rhead brothers, 
and other well-known illustrators whose skill is un- 
questioned but who have become so wedded to this 
particular method as to refuse to recognize its lim- 
itations. One of the best exponents of the legiti- 
mate use of linear drawing is the French illustrator, 
M. Boutet de Monvel, who appreciates the beauty 
of simplicity, and who possesses, moreover, the rare 
sympathy with child-life and child-nature which is so 
essential in work for children. 

Another quality which is almost a sine qua non 
in pictures for children is action. Children like to 
see things go. and the figures which appeal to them 
are those which are doing something. A boy in 
the second grade chose a spirited picture. •• A is for 
archer," by Mr. Stuart Hardy, in preference to a 
decorative treatment of Grimm's girl at the well, 
by Mr. Crane. When asked why, he replied, 
••Because I like to shoot." The picture must tell a 
story in order to interest the average child, and 
the story must be such as he can appreciate. This 
leads me to say that Mr. Hardy is one of the most 
thoroughly satisfactory of modern illustrators for 
children. He is known mainly through his black- 
and-white pictures in the Nister books. Mother 
Goose, Andersen's and Grimm's stories, and a few 
other volumes of the same class. His figures are 
drawn with a few strong strokes of the pen. and de- 
pict the most beautiful and most lovable children. 
Besides the life and spirit which his drawings show, 
there is also sympathy, imagination, a rare sense of 
the humorous, and a treatment of the grotesque 
which never descends to coarseness. If his pictures 
lack at times the perfect naturalness of M. Boutet 
de Monvel's, they compensate for the loss by more of 
grace and vigor. Miss Fanny Cory has done some 
excellent things in a similar style, and gives promise 
of becoming one of our most successful illustrators 
for children. 

Beauty is a quality which children are not slow 
to discover and appreciate in a picture. They like 
pictures of beautiful children. Miss Maud Hum- 
phrey's little doll-faced cherubs are perhaps a shade 
too pretty. Certain boys, upon arriving at the su- 
perior age of twelve to fourteen years, affect to scoff 
at them: but it is doubtful, after all, whether the 
contempt is not directed mainly toward the elabo- 



rate frills and ruffles which encircle them. Miss 
Kate Greenaway's quaint little figures are pictur- 
esquely attractive, and though the fitful aesthetic 
impulse which gave them birth has passed away 
there is something too sweet and beautiful in them 
to let them grow old. Mr. Reginald Birch's chil- 
dren are always popular. True, they are idealized 
children : if they were not, they would lose much of 
their charm, — for children themselves are idealists. 
Their admiration goes out toward the things that are 
different from the everyday, and an ideal face ap- 
peals to them where a face expressing individuality 
does not. The tendency of modern art is to despise 
ideal beauty and to strive for individuality — for 
character. It is a tendency which does not meet 
with the approval of childhood. 

As to the grotesque, it does not appeal equally 
to all children. Young children usually dislike it, 
though they are sometimes fascinated by it as ani- 
mals are charmed by a serpent. There is in most 
children a stage, which begins at the age of about 
six or seven and lasts for several years, during 
which this desire for the extravagant, the uncouth, 
and the terrible sometimes becomes a passion. To 
fail to recognize the craving is usually to drive your 
children to satisfy it, sometimes surreptitiously, with 
the worst possible material. There is the grotesquely 
fearful and the grotesquely comic, and both have 
their fascination at this period. Your child will 
probably try your soul by discarding the artistic 
picture-books which you have bought him and 
showing a decided preference for the adventures of 
" Buster Brown " and " the Katzenjammer Kids," 
as depicted in vivid red, blue, and yellow on the 
pages of the Sunday newspaper. Discourage these 
pictures by all means ; but give him something good 
to take their place, — something really funny, that 
is bright wiihout being lurid and comical without 
being vulgar. Mr. Denslow has done some good 
things in this field, though he often comes perilously 
near the line of vulgarity. An expurgated edition of 
his •' Father Goose," which should omit about one 
picture in ten, would make an excellent nonsense- 
book for children, and would satisfy this temporary 
demand for the grotesque. 

As to the grotesquely terrible, your child must 
have a little of it if he insists, but don't let him have 
it at night if you value either his comfort or your 
own. A child must be treated tenderly at this pe- 
riod, and the imaginative nature, which is then most 
intense, must be so trained as to lead him to enjoy 
the fanciful in beauty rather than in ugliness. Fair- 
ies are better than hobgoblins, and the child should 
be allowed all the fairies he wants, until he outgrows 
them and asks for something more substantial. 

Children like animal pictures in almost any form, 
— dictionary- and geography animals included. The 
most delicately fanciful treatment that has perhaps 
ever been given to the animal creation is that of Mr. 
F. S. Church. Church's animals combine the im- 
aginative, the poetic, the grotesque, — all with the 



460

most delicate sense of humor, and with a sympa- 
thetic touch that makes the child at one with them. 

So much for what the child likes. But his pic- 
tures should not only give him what he likes, — they 
should give it to him in the best possible way. The 
touch of the true artist should be manifest in them. 
Your child will find color in the vivid pictures of 
the Sunday newspaper already referred to, and at 
first he will appreciate it in that form quite as much 
as in the most artistic color-plates which you can 
get for him. He will find a broad and attractive 
treatment in the advertisements in the street-cars, 
and will be quite pleased with them. He will find 
action in the scrawls which he makes upon his slate, 
■and will satisfy his craving for the grotesque with 
the crudest of caricatures. But here is where he 
needs your careful and discriminating guidance. 
Let his books be illustrated by a master-hand, and 
accustom him to the best art. It will not be long 
before he will recognize and appreciate it. By the 
best art, I do not mean necessarily that of Botticelli 
or of Raphael, though he should know some of the 
world's great art works as soon as he is old enough 
to understand them. I mean simply good art, 
whether the drawing be that of a tin cup or of a 
cathedral. There are too many illustrators who try 
to atone for poor draughtmanship by a wealth of 
carefully wrought details, — textures, shadows, and 
all that. Scores of amateurs have found a market 
for their work in the multiplicity of modern books, 
but their touch is readily discernible. Their figures 
are wooden or putty, and their faces are expression- 
less or idiotic. 

The child naturally assumes that the pictures 
which adorn his books are right pictures, and from 
them he gets his ideas of drawing, — his first im- 
pression of what art is. There is no harm in giving 
him such entirely natural and enjoyable scrawls as 
those which illustrate Lear's Nonsense Books. The 
■child is not deceived by them. He takes them as 
a, joke, and the joke is healthful and stimulating. 
These pictures of Lear's, with all their crudity, are 
far more expressive than many finished pictures 
which the child finds in his books and which he 
supposes to be in some sort a standard of artistic 
excellence because they pretend to be something. 
Do not buy for your child books which are falsely or 
poorly illustrated. Better give him no pictures at 
all than wrong ones. Should you not teach him 
good art as well as good literature? Many a man 
confesses with regret that he does not know the 
difference between a good picture and a bad one. 
If this is true of you, see to it that your children 
know more about such matters than you do ; and 
if you cannot trust yourself to select their picture- 
books, ask the assistance of some friend in whose 
discrimination you have confidence. The well- 
illustrated book costs a little more, sometimes, than 
the poorly illustrated book, but not always, — and 
if it costs more it is worth more. Often it does not 
<;ost more, but only requires a little more care and 
judgment in its selection. 



We come now to the moral effect of pictures. 
They should not be used as a vehicle for teaching 
morality, but on the other hand they should never 
by inference or example teach immorality, — and 
by immorality I mean anything that is mean or 
degrading. I have before me a child's book in 
which several boys are pictured as having tied a tin 
can to a dog's tail, and are immensely amused at 
the struggles of the poor beast to rid himself of it, 
as he flees wildly down the street. The accompany- 
ing story ends with the moral that this was a very 
wrong thing for the boys to do ; but the artist has 
not expressed this saving moral conclusion. Both 
story and picture are bad ; for while one boy will 
pity the dog, another will think it a good joke and 
will perhaps decide to try the experiment on the 
next unfortunate canine that crosses his path. 

A small boy of my acquaintance became highly 
interested, not long ago, in the adventures of a 
naughty youth presented in the comic supplement 
of a well-known newspaper. The youth in the news- 
paper shampooed his sister's hair, and anointed the 
poodle, with a mixture of ink, glue, and the family 
hair-tonic, leaving the remainder of the compound 
in the bottle for the use of his father and mother. 
The results, as pictorially set forth, were so intensely 
amusing that the small observer immediately took 
steps to repeat them in real life. Much mischief 
is suggested in such ways as this, and the sugges- 
tions come from artists who have little sympathy 
with children, knowing them mainly as a theme to 
make jokes about. 

All this emphasizes the point that the true artist 
for children must have sympathy as well as experi- 
ence with his audience, must know what is good for 
them, and must love them too much to offer any- 
thing that is not of his best. The artist shows his 
character in his work. Let it be a good character, 
and your children will unconsciously imbibe from 
his pictures heroism, gentleness, and nobility. Let 
it be a mean character, and its influence will be 
mean. Fortunately, there are plenty of good men 
and women who are illustrating children's books, 
and who are putting into their work not only skill 
and genius, but also good judgment, sympathy, and 
love. 

Let the parents and teachers, — those who buy 
books for the children of the present generation, — 
but discriminate in their choice, realizing that the 
picture is as important as the printed page in form- 
ing taste and influencing character, and they will 
soon see in their children the results of this power- 
ful educative influence. They will see, too, an 
improvement in the illustrations of the books which 
are being offered to the young. Publishers will 
not issue poorly illustrated books, if it is found that 
well illustrated books are in demand. It is thus 
in the power of book-buyers to raise the character 
of all books by demanding what is best, — not what 
is most expensive, but what is elevating both to the 
taste and to the morals.

Disraeli Self-Portrayed.* 



Close on the heels of Mr. Morley's Gladstone 
comes a life of his great rival, Disraeli. It 
would have been too much to expect from Mr. 
Meynell a biography equal to Mr. Morley's ; 
and so no one will be disappointed. Neverthe- 
less it is somewhat remarkable that no writer 
has yet come forward to make full and satis- 
factory use of the wealth of biographical mate- 
rial left behind him, now more than twenty 
years ago, by the Earl of Beaconsfield. Per- 
haps this may be explained in part by the fact 
that he is a far less sympathetic subject than 
his great antagonist. His brilliance, his wit, 
his statecraft, his indomitable determination 
to overcome disadvantages of race and station 
and to raise himself to the summit of his ambi- 
tions, compel our admiration ; but hardly would 
one wish, either as writer or as reader, to linger 
over the not always edifying details of that 
astonishing conquest of success, as one lingers 
over the successive stages of Gladstone's rise. 

Mr. Meynell does well to call his book an 
unconventional biography made up as it is 
very largely of selections from Disraeli's con- 
versations and writings. Book I., forming 
the first third of the volume, is entitled, " His 
Talk from Youth to Old Age." The second 
book, which comprises the remaining two- 
thirds, is headed, " His Letters, Books, and 
Public Life." The work is thus a scrap-book 
rather than a formal biography ; it furnishes 
no complete and consecutive account of the 
man's career, and no large view of him in rela- 
tion to his country and his time. It will serve 
some future biographer as a valuable source to 
draw from, and meanwhile it will amuse the 
lover of personal anecdote and the unassiduous 
student who likes a book that can be opened 
anywhere and closed at any time without doing 
violence to the narrative. The arrangement is 
topical rather than chronological, and the para- 
graph and page headings serve as useful finger- 
posts to the desultory reader. The author 
refers to himself, not as a biographer, but as a 
collector of Disraeliana, and he is manifestly 
enamored of his chosen subject. To him Dis- 
raeli is a hero, else the book had never been 
written. A few quotations will give a taste of

its quality. The reported utterances of Disraeli 
are hardly ever to be taken at their face value. 
With him truth was a pearl not to be cast before 
swine ; or, to use the author's words, — 

■ Some people we all know whom we, serious, refuse 
to treat seriously. . . . ' Before you can understand 
Pitt, you must understand Shelburne,' Disraeli once 
said ; and before you can interpret the sayings of Dis- 
raeli, you must in some instances have an acquaintance 
with the character of those to whom they were spoken." 

By a curious chance, both the names by 
which we know the author of " Contarini 
Fleming " are variously pronounced. " Oh, 
knock out the apostrophe ; it looks so foreign. 
Write my name in one word — Disraeli." This 
to a newspaper editor when the young politician 
was canvassing the Maidstone vote. The name 
" Israel," according to Mr. Meynell, indicates 
the correct pronunciation of " Disraeli "; and 
the Countess of Beaconsfield, we are told by 
Lord Rosebery, once gave him very emphatic- 
ally to understand that she was not the Countess 
of Beckonsfield. Friction in this small matter 
being smoothed away, we proceed. 

Disraeli's early shifting from party to party, 
and his unheroic encounter with O'Connell, our 
author presents in as favorable a light as pos- 
sible. Of the eccentricities and absurdities of 
conduct and attire by which the young novelist 
sought to attract attention, little is said; and 
we are willing to pass over them as belonging 
to the follies of youth. Disraeli's relations 
to his family, especially his love for his sister 
Sarah, as evidenced by his letters to her, are 
matters one may dwell on with pleasure. 

"Domestic love — the patrimony of the Jewish 

race had a conspicuous illustration in Disraeli ; and 

he knew, even when he wrote of schoolboy life, the love 
that two men of his race felt for each other, passing 
the love of women. His love for his father makes a 
delightful record; there is nothing quite like it to be 
found in the memoirs of other statesmen, from Pitt to 
Macaulay and Gladstone. . . . This familiar love of 
fathers and brothers was not then so common among 
Englishmen as it now is. Some sons rarely saw their 
fathers, thought of them and addressed them by formal 
titles, and never kissed them. Disraeli was too manly to 
think that affection unmanned men; and in this regard 
he may be quoted as one of the revivers of masculine 
friendship among Englishmen." 

We read, too, of Disraeli's private character, 
that he was by nature so averse to all that is 
questionable in conversation and anecdote that 
no one dared twice tell him a story unfit for 
ears polite. Further matters of personal in- 
terest are contained in the following : 

" Disraeli, who knew railways when they were yet a 
novelty, never got over a certain nervousness about 
catching a train. ... In other ways than those of the

[Dec. 16, 



rail, Disraeli showed himself a man of instant anxieties. 
A seemingly phlegmatic man may in reality be a very 
nervous man. . . . Disraeli had the nervous man's one 
hope — courage. He did not fly; he overcame. He 
liked to be asked to the Royal Academy Banquet; but 
on such occasions there was an indigestion under his 
plate in the slip of paper containing the name of his 
toast. His buttoning and unbuttoning of his coat during 
the stress of a Parliamentary oration, his handkerchief 
play, and half his gestures, were the tricks of a speaker 
in search of distractions that put him and his audience 
at ease. He never made a speech of any consequence 
that did not cost him a moment of reluctance." 

That this nervousness never stood in the way 
of a swift and masterly despatch of business, 
we may rest well assured. Bismarck, as quoted 
by our author, has said of him : 

" I repeatedly had Lord Beaconsfield to spend the 
evening with me during the Berlin Congress. As he 
was unwell he only came oti condition of being alone, 
and I thus had many an opportunity of getting to know 
him well. I must say that in spite of his fantastic 
novel -writing, he is a capable statesman, far above 
Gortschakoff and many others. It was easy to transact 
business with him. In a quarter of an hour you knew 
exactly how you stood with him; the limits to which he 
was prepared to go were clearly defined, and a rapid 
summary soon defined [sic] matters. Beaconsfield 
speaks magnificent and melodious English, and has a 
good voice." 

Queen Victoria's liking for Disraeli and aver- 
sion for Gladstone are well known. "Gladstone 
treats the Queen like a public department," 
said Disraeli, in explanation ; " I treat her like 
a woman." It has elsewhere been recorded 
that the Queen gave as one reason of her dis- 
comfort in Gladstone's presence, that he always 
addressed her as if she had been a public as- 
sembly. Yet before yielding her approval and 
confidence to his political opponent, she had 
to overcome strong prejudices. 

" She, more than most, had to overcome prejudices 
against the alien, against the trespasser upon the en- 
closure of British politics, against the fiction-writer's 
appearance upon the stage of fact. The Prince Con- 
sort's dislike for him was another bar to his approach 
to the Queen; and the Court's conversion to the Repeal 
of the Corn Laws, together with its adhesion to the 
popular reverence for Peel, produced something ap- 
proaching a feeling of positive dislike for the stripling 
David who with a rude sling of speech brought low the 
Goliath of the Philistines. Little did the Queen im- 
agine in those days that Disraeli was to be more to her 
than Peel: more to her than even Melbourne, that very 
fine British gentleman to whom she brought the affec- 
tionate homage which the young girl yields to the most 
accomplished man of the world among her senior friends; 
that he was to rank, not merely as her Prime Miuister, 
in the ordinary sense of the term, but as the Prime 
Minister among all the ministers of her long reign." 

In discussing these two statesmen, Gladstone 
and Disraeli, Mr. Meynell shows plainly to 
which of the opposing camps he belongs. He 



speaks of Gladstone as having " the habit of 
identifying himself with the Deity and his 
opponent with the Devil," and adds : " Glad- 
stone had, from the first, formed a low opinion 
of Disraeli. There are those who say that he 
joined the Liberal ranks because he could not 
bear association with Disraeli in the Tory." 
In proof of the favorite minister's attachment 
to the Queen, a letter of his is given, written 
in 1879, soon after a slight misunderstanding 
between the two. One paragraph may be 
cited. 

" I love the Queen — perhaps the only person in this 
world left to me that I do love; and therefore you 
can understand how much it worries and disquiets me 
when there is a cloud between us. It is very foolish 
on my part, but my heart, unfortunately, has not 
withered like my frame, and when it is affected, I am 
as harassed as I was fifty years ago." 

Of Disraeli's witty sayings the book contains 
a good number, but not all of unquestionable 
paternity — as, indeed, the author admits. To 
an author, in acknowledgment of his book, he 
is reported to have said, " Many thanks ; I 
shall lose no time in reading it." Much the 
same formula is ascribed to Gladstone. Oliver 
Wendell Holmes, as cited by Mr. Meynell, 
made use of a still neater phrase when, after 
a few compliments, he concluded with "I am 
lying under a sense of obligation." One more 
smart saying of Disraeli's, and we have done. 
" Everybody knows the stages of a lawyer's 
career — he tries in turn to get on, to get 
honors, to get honest." As already remarked, 
this entertaining volume is not to be taken too 
seriously. There is diversion, and also infor- 
mation, to be found within its covers, and the 
many illustrations add greatly to the interest ; 
but a full, critical, and impartial biography it 
decidedly is not, and does not pretend to be.

A New History of the Middle West.* 

The days of the pioneer history seem to have 
come again — this time in a large volume which 
revives the border legends and stories of the 
Indian wars so familiar to our forebears. This 
" History of the Mississippi Valley, from its 
Discovery to the End of Foreign Domination," 
by Messrs. John It. Spears and A. H. Clark, is 
avowedly a "popular" work and ought to be so 
judged ; yet it is difficult to restrain impatience

when finding this legendary matter under the 
title " history." No one would think of com- 
paring the work wjth Winsor's " Westward 
Movement " or Doctor Hosmer's " Mississippi 
Valley," two scholarly and discriminative 
works covering the same ground ; it is rather 
to be placed on the same shelf with Mr. Roose- 
velt's "Winning of the West" and Albach's 
" Western Annals." 

A description of Champlain's discoveries 
opens the volume, under the happy title, " On 
the Brim of the Great Basin." Stories of the 
later French explorations in the Valley proper 
follow in order, condensed from Mr. Thwaites's 
translation of the "Jesuit Relations." A chap- 
ter on the Indians in the Valley is followed by 
a description of the expulsion of the French. 
Accounts of Pontiac and Dunmore's wars, 
George Rogers Clark's expedition, the battle 
of King's Mountain, Spanish intrigue in the 
Southwest, and the Louisiana Purchase, make 
up the bulk of the volume. Interspersed are 
chapters on frontier life and on the Christian 
Indians. 

The volume is difficult to estimate or to clas- 
sify. The reproduction of many old maps and 
original illustrations would lead one to expect 
a thorough treatise based on the sources of 
information. On the contrary, the material is 
almost without exception second-hand. Fre- 
quently passages and even paragraphs are 
quoted from some present-day writer, with 
proper acknowledgement. There is no bibliog- 
raphy, but the local histories of the states in the 
Valley must have been drawn upon largely for 
the details and stories. In the same way, the 
illustrations include some rare and instructive 
reproductions, with others that require a strong 
imagination to determine their pertinency to 
the subject-matter. Portraits of General and 
Mrs. Jackson appear, for instaDce, in a chapter 
on Frontier Life about 1775. The naming of 
Marietta, Ohio, furnishes the raison d'etre for 
a portrait of Marie Antoinette. One portrait 
of George Rogers Clark bears the legend, 
"Said to be from life "; and another, " Said to 
be the only portrait from life now in existence." 
Somehow this reminds one of the skull of St. 
Patrick when a boy. The title on Lewis's 
map has managed to creep around to a margin. 

No doubt many readers will follow the 
ancient legends and enjoy them fully as much 
as if they had not been disproved again and 
again. George Rogers Clark will continue to 
lean with folded arms against the door-post at 
Kaskaskia, and bid the dancers continue — 



but to remember that they are dancing under 
Virginia and not Great Britain. This story, 
first emanating from Denney, is clearly dis- 
credited by Clark's narrative and by the other 
contemporary descriptions in the Draper MSS. 
collection. Clark's brave expedition into the 
Northwest is here given credit for the Amer- 
ican title to the region in the peace negotia- 
tions, regardless of the fact that the American 
negotiators never mentioned Clark, and Con- 
gress gave them no instructions that mentioned 
him or his expedition. The Jesuit "college" 
at Kaskaskia still finds a place in this history. 
The absurdity of an institution of higher learn- 
ing at an Indian mission in Illinois in 1721 
ought to stop the circulation of the story from 
very suspicion, even if different investigators 
had not shown that " the Jesuits from the 
seminary at Kaskaskia " meant Jesuits in 
Kaskaskia from the seminary at Quebec. The 
inscription, "D. Boon cilled a bar," on a tree 
near the head of Wautauga, is referred to as 
confidently as though it rested on some good 
authority. John Sevier is picturesquely made 
into a fugitive from justice, although he was 
dwelling quietly in Greene county until elected 
to the state legislature in 1789. These are 
illustrations of history as it is written from 
current books and legendary tales, instead of 
from the sources of historical fact and know- 
ledge. 

" Strenuousness " is evidently the motive 
sought in all actions of the pioneers, and of the 
national government concerning them. This 
" my country " style of writing history ignores 
the fact that there is another side to the story. 
The authors bitterly arraign Britain for using 
Indians in the Revolutionary war, yet the use 
made of them by the Americans is barely men- 
tioned. The action of the Spanish authorities 
at New Orleans in closing the port in 1802 is 
condemned as a violation of the treaty made 
seven years before ; yet a reading of the treaty 
would have shown that the right of deposit was 
limited to three years, and had long since been 
abrogated because not renewed. In another 
place, a chief reason why Napoleon sold Louis- 
iana is said to have been his fear lest the fierce 
Americans would pass down the river with the 
current and make war upon Louisiana. An 
interview with Napoleon on this point would 
be interesting, although scarcely supportive. 
The swashbuckler style of American history 
might be passed without comment, if it did 
not breed jingoism and offensive ultra-Amer- 
icanism. On the other hand, it must be said 



464

that the book is likely to prove attractive to 
the general reader, and that any production 
which may lead to the study of local history is 
to be commended. The handsome appearance 
of the volume will no doubt attract attention 
to a perusal of its contents. 

Edwin E. Sparks. 



An Heir of Velasquez.* 

The writer about painting, even when ad- 
dressing himself to general rather than special 
interests, must always remember that it is the 
•outside, the appearauce, of things that is pri- 
marily the painter's concern, and that he is 
limited to a single aspect of his subject and to 
a single instant of time. The failure to realize 
this fundamental difference between the art of 
the painter and the art of the writer is a pro- 
lific source of much literary misappreciation of 
painters' work. The very thing that is deserv- 
ing of highest praise, — that quality of the 
picture that makes its excellence altogether of 
its own kind, — is thus counted against it as a 
fault, and the splendid self-containment that 
holds the painter strictly to his own terms is 
reckoned as narrowness or superficiality of 
view. 

In the making of an illustrated art book, it 
has been quite impossible until lately to pro- 
duce plates that are the just equivalent in 
light and shade of the works themselves. It 
follows, therefore, that we have often to take 
what the writer of the text has to say about 
the pictures with a large measure of trust, for 
we are unable, on account of the imperfections 
of the reproductions, to determine from our 
own independent standpoint whether this or 
that judgment be faulty or sound. But there 
is no such difficulty in the case of the volume 
under review. The reproductions are so per- 
fectly executed, and convey so exact an idea of 
the originals, that most of us will accept the 
very high praise of Mrs. Meynell's introduc- 
tory note, and lend our consent to an estimate 
which, subtly implicit to the last clause, finally 
affirms that John S. Sargent is "one of the 
family of Velasquez, and no less than his chief 
heir." 

Were the sixty-two photogravure plates here 
presented one touch less excellent than they 
are ; were they not such that the significance 
of no single brush stroke is confused or lost ;

ductory Note by Mrs. Meynell. London : William Heinemann. 
New York : Imported by Charles Seribner's Sons. 



such, in a word, as only the most highly evolved 
processes of reproduction in this kind could 
make them, we might hesitate, judging only 
from the evidence in hand, to accept so high a 
verdict. As it is, we are able to follow the master 
line for line, and value for value, and almost 
tint for tint — for such perfection of light and 
shade has in its suggestion the full potency of 
the colors themselves ; and our conclusions need 
be hardly more or less at fault than if we had 
before us the paintings themselves. 

The introductory note by Mrs. Meynell is 
brief, comprising hardly more than four thou- 
sand words, but it is vastly suggestive. It 
brings before the mind all of those considera- 
tions that bear upon the subject as it concerns 
those for whom pictures are made. It also 
presents the claims of the art considered as 
handicraft ; for, as the writer points out, tech- 
nical procedure, while on one side the concern 
only of those who paint or are trying to, is also 
an unnegligible quantity for others, when, as 
in this art of painting, it becomes so very a part 
of what addresses itself to all, and is perceived 
by all. 

There is a " display " of the brush made 
familiar to us in a good deal of modern paint- 
ing that has little in common with Mr. Sargent's 
splendid assurance, we might almost say auda- 
city, of procedure. But even in such a por- 
trait as " Carmencita," or in that of Coventry 
Patmore (which Mrs. Meynell finds to make 
" permanent, too singly, one aspect of an often 
altering face "), Mr. Sargent does not seem to 
be consciously recommending his art. Though 
the manner in which he has given the effect of 
life to these painted images is greatly impres- 
sive, so also are some characteristics of the 
people depicted. Not even in those portraits 
in which the technical method most asserts 
itself does it seem to arrogate authority, or to 
claim for itself anything higher than a ser- 
vant's place. 

But while Mr. Sargent's most conspicuously- 
displayed art of painting seems not for its own 
sake, but rather for the subject's, it would ap- 
pear that perception had been here and there 
too instant, and touch too swift, to get quite 
at the heart of the matter. So, while in the 
opinion of the reviewer, no exception can fairly 
be taken to the most commanding exhibition 
of a skill perhaps incomparable in modern 
painting, some of these portraits do, as Mrs. 
Meynell suggests, hold us too definitely and 
firmly to the chosen aspect of the subject. We 
have a vivid realization of a particular appear-

ance of the person, but remain uninformed to 
a degree as to what that person is at other 
times and under other circumstances of lighting 
and of place. 

There are, however, many of Mr. Sargent's 
pictures that seem to carry a clear suggestion 
of the whole personality. He appears often to 
have divined what intimacy reveals, and to 
make us feel as though we had known the 
subject long and well. Those portraits that 
tell us most about their subjects are, as a rule, 
less pictorially impressive than the ones that 
fix our attention more exclusively to the appear- 
ance of the person in the selected moment. 
They would be less arresting seen on a gallery 
wall, and at a distance ; but they hold our in- 
terest longer, for they get nearer to that mean 
of character, that blend and union of compos- 
ite traits, that is the person. " Miss Cary 
Thomas," "Lady Agnew," "Lord Watson," 
and "Lord Russell of Killowen" are notable 
examples of this wholeness of characterization, 
and we find their pictorial simplicity and un- 
aggressiveness a condition of this wholeness. 

It had not been our privilege until we saw 
this volume to know those works of Mr. Sar- 
gent that have inspired the highest praise. 
We can now find a warrant for what, judged 
by the paintings of his that we have seen and 
by the more or less inadequate reproductions 
of those that we had not, had seemed extrava- 
gant laudation. We believe the excellence of 
such portraits as " The Misses Hunter " and 
of those to which we have just referred, as well 
as of some others, could hardly be overstated, 
nor can we conceive of any environment of art 
in which they would fail to assert themselves 
and make good their own individual claims. 
They have the directness of a Hals, the solid- 
ity of a Rembrandt, the combined subtlety and 
sureness of perception and touch of a Velasquez, 
and with it all the well-stamped impress of this 
new master's hand. 

Mrs. Meynell says that Rodin recognized 
the supreme master of painting in the por- 
trait of that " bouquet of flowers," the three 
••Misses Hunter"; nor would he, we think, 
have found less in any one of perhaps a dozen 
of the pictures here shown. But he would, we 
believe, have been chiefly impressed with an- 
other distinction, great but not "supreme" in 
this field, in viewing some of the portraits that 
make up this splendid volume. He must have 
felt what Mrs. Meynell discerns, that the point 
of view is here and there too "sudden," and 
that the artist's sense of some graphically- 



expressive or captivating aspect of his subject, 
has been more keen than his appreciation of 
the character itself, viewed as a whole. 

There is, however, about those of Mr. Sar- 
gent's pictures that fall sensibly short of the 
greatest distinction, a decorative charm and 
splendor that is almost if not quite unique in 
portrait art, and that independently of its truth 
to life makes each new work of his an event. 
His power to realize the potentialities of his 
theme, in those ways that minister to the de- 
light of the eye, is clearly marked in " El 
Jaleo " and in "A Spanish Dance "; and best, 
perhaps, in that marvellous picture of two chil- 
dren in a garden, the title of which, " Carna- 
tion, Lily, Lily, Rose," acknowledges the master 
motive, and where the two children are but 
incidents of line and color in the entrancing 
blend and play of evening, day, and candle light. 
Here the artist frankly acknowledges that for 
him beauty is enough. Even in the field into 
which his genius has been diverted, in works 
like " Madame Gautreau," where the motive 
is portraiture pure and simple, the subject 
walks hand in hand with the graces, and we 
are as much convinced of beauty as of life. 

It is in Mr. Sargent's portrait groups, how- 
ever, that his superb appreciation of the de- 
lightful possibilities of his subject are most 
fully displayed. The group gives fuller scope 
than the single figure to his genius for captiva- 
ting arrangement of picture furniture, and for 
the employment of those devices of foil and 
counter-foil, accent and contrast, that make 
pictures pleasant to look upon. 

Apart from his " Carnation, Lily, Lily, 
Rose," which we think has no rival for purely 
aesthetic charm in all this artist's work, his 
three groups of " The Misses Hunter," " The 
Ladies Alexandra, Mary, and Theo Acheson," 
and " Lady Elcho, Mrs. Tennant, and Mrs. 
Adeane," have peculiarly the qualities that touch 
us where music does. These are subordinated 
in the impression of the first-named group to 
our sense of what the subjects themselves are, 
— and this is the picture's great distinction ; 
while in the others our delight in the fluent 
grace of line and in the harmony of the forms 
and color is more vivid than our appreciation 
of the things that a portrait should first make 
clear, and from which no graces or beauty of its 
style should be able to divert attention. Nor 
is the first of these three groups anything less 
than superb in all its superficial art. It is in 
the very best manner of this master ; and yet, 
first and last, mastering our consciousness of

all graciousness of an art that to pause upon 
is to marvel at, we are held by these living 
vital presences, and all the grace and beauty 
of the pictorial arrangement is as an open door 
leading to them. 

It is to be remarked in even the briefest note 
on Mr. Sargent's work, that he paints man, 
woman, and child with an equal art ; nor are 
we able to say, after a careful comparison of 
the examples shown, that he excels in any one 
of these three directions ; for whether it be a 
man's strength, a woman's charm, or a child's 
naivete that is his concern, his sympathy seems 
equally engaged and his art equally fit. 

In his portraits of children, we must find 
that characteristic of his genius which makes 
some pictures impress us as too " sudden " in 
their point of view, a first condition of their great 
charm. A child's face is as plastic as potter's 
clay, as quickly changing as April weather. 
All is fluent, mobile, unfixed. Art then, to fix 
it, must be instant in perception and swiftly 
sure in touch. Mr. Sargent's art is, almost 
ideally, both ; and because it is, he has been 
able to catch that flashing butterfly thing, a 
child's soul, as it shows on the face of it. 

Speaking lightly, it might be said of Mr. Sar- 
gent's portraits of men that they are " speaking 
likenesses "; but the description would leave 
what is best in them undefined. Notably in his 
portrait of Mr. Asher Wertheimer would this 
be the case. There is much more here than 
could ever come out in the man's speech, more 
even than he is silently conscious of. We feel 
in looking at this portrait that we should know 
what he would do, even before he himself had 
made up his mind about it. Mrs. Meynell calls 
attention to the fine way in which Mr. Sargent 
differentiates the English lady from women of 
any other race or class. Her observation would 
apply equally well to the English gentleman, 
and here. This head and figure are most 
deeply informed with things racial and con- 
genital; face and gesture are so animated with 
the spirit of that unconscious ego that has the 
casting vote in closely balanced alternatives, 
that what would still be an open question for 
him is for us a foregone conclusion. In a word 
we are convinced that through Mr. Sargent's 
portrait we know Mr. Asher Wertheimer bet- 
ter than he knows himself. » 

All whose interest and care it is to be well 
informed about what great painters are doing, 
must feel indebted to the publishers of this 
volume for thus bringing this master's most 
representative work within our reach. Mrs. 



Meynell says : " The coming of a great painter 
is so rare, and his contemporaries are so much 
and so often taken by surprise by the annual 
exhibition of his genius, that it must be difficult 
for them to assure themselves of what he is." 
Those whose privilege it is to possess or to have 
access to this book will find it less difficult to 
reach such assurance.

a New Book about Hawthorne.* 



If we cannot adopt the enthusiastic sugges- 
tion of the publishers and welcome Mr. Julian 
Hawthorne's new book as " the most important 
and valuable literary contribution of the year," 
we can pronounce it a volume of extreme inter- 
est, and well worthy of a place in the rapidly 
accumulating mass of material upon which 
someone will ultimately base an adequate his- 
tory of the New England writers of the last 
century. 

After saying this much, we must stop and 
point with some indignation at a few of the 
flies unnecessarily present in the ointment. In 
the first place the volume is full of passages to 
which the reader, for various reasons, will wish 
to turn again ; but there is not the slightest 
trace of an index to assist one in realizing such 
a desire. The page headings, grouped together 
at the opening of each chapter in the outward 
semblance of subject analyses, would have less- 
ened the difficulty somewhat if they had been 
selected simply with a view to service. But 
here comes in the second fly in the form of 
a sacrifice of such service to the method of 
the headline writer in the daily newspaper. 
" My Father's Decapitation," " I Kick My 
Aunt Lizzie," " Hindlegs," " A Respectable 
Female Atheist," "Lovely but Reprehensible 
Madam!" "Unsentimental Little Quadruped," 
"It Gnawed Me Terribly," "Her Skeleton, 
Huddled, Dry, Awful," " Rivers of Human 
Gore," "She Ripped the Man Open," "Fleay, 
Malarious Paradise," " Not Even a Bone of Her 
was Left," are a few of the headings which 
strike the eye as one turns the pages rapidly 
over. At the top of one page we find the well 
known Horatian line, " Dulce est Desipere in 
Loco." Very good ! but Mr. Julian Hawthorne 
should hardly find the allowably pleasant place 
for playing the fool in the headlines of a book 
devoted to his father's memory. It is not to

be supposed that he made the selections, but it 
is not too much to suppose that he could have 
prevented such vulgarity. 

We are sorry to say, however, that the evi- 
dences of bad taste in the volume are not wholly 
confined to the headings. We may illustrate 
by the flippant references to James Martineau: 
"Like Emerson, he had ascended a Unitarian 
pulpit, but, unlike Emerson, he stayed there 
long after what he was pleased to regard as his 
convictions had ceased to possess even a Uni- 
tarian degree of religious quality." " He was 
so elevated and superior that one could hardly 
help believing that he must know something of 
value, and this illusion was the easier because 
he did know so much in the way of schol- 
arly learning." The Brownings are certainly 
worthy of respectful treatment, but they fare 
even worse than Dr. Martineau. After admit- 
ting graciously that Browning's son " was not 
such a mollycoddle and ass as he looked," he 
continues, " My mother took him at his moth- 
er's valuation, and both she and my father 
have expressed admiration of the whole Brown- 
ing tribe in their published journals." Mrs. 
Browning herself seemed to him " a sort of 
miniature monstrosity ; there was no body to 
her, only a mass of dark curls and queer, dark 
eyes, and an enormous mouth with thick lips ; 
no portrait of her has dared to show the half 
of it. Her hand was like a bird's claw." Per- 
haps Mr. Hawthorne would do better to trust 
the portraits than to base such a description 
on recollections from mere childhood. 

But after all these unpleasant features are 
discounted, we still have a book of great value 
to the history of American letters. Its general 
tone is not unkindly, in spite of such passages 
as we have quoted concerning the Brownings 
and Dr. Martineau. In some cases the feeling 
is distinctly warm where others have shown an 
emphatic tendency in the other direction, — 
as with Charlotte Cushman, who fared so badly 
in the notable autobiography of William J. 
Stillman. The attack of Stillman, however, 
had none of the flippancy which is so marked 
a feature in the cases before us. Not the least 
valuable point in Mr. Hawthorne's book is the 
information we get concerning many minor 
characters with whom his father came into in- 
timate contact, such as Herman Melville, Henry 
Bright, and Francis Bennoch. The happy home 
life of the Hawthorne family is constantly com- 
ing into the foreground, and this is well, for 
much of Hawthorne's published work lends 
itself not unnaturally to the mistaken inference 



that he was not personally of a happy disposi- 
tion. 

The author promises another volume, at 
some indefinite time in the future, dealing 
with his father primarily as a man of letters. 
The best hand to deal with a man's standing 
as an artist can hardly be that of a son, but 
we may at least hope for a more intimate know- 
ledge of Hawthorne's literary methods than 
another would be likely to give.

Recent Nature Chroxicl.es.* 



Winter is the time to read nature-books. 

"Id summer, -when the shawes be shene 
And leaves be large and long, 
It is full merry in fair forest 
To hear the fowles' song." 

But it isn't merry at all to stay at home and 
read about the shawes and the forest and the 
fowles. Even in the autumn, so long as the 
sunshine holds and the air is full of cheery 
good-byes from birds southward bound, the best 
nature-book ever written is but dull business 
compared with a walk in the open. But when 
winter shuts the nature-lover in, and bids him 
have recourse to the inward eye which is the 
bliss of birdless days, the nature-book comes 
into its own. It reenforces the inward eye, and 
prepares its outward counterpart to see new 
sights next spring. Given a good fire and 
plenty of nature-books, the lover of birds and 
blossoms can get through the winter in com- 
parative comfort. 

If the season's publications do not provide 
very plentifully for the nature-lover's need, 
they at least furnish one book which is perfect 
of its kind. This is Mr. Bradford Torrey's 
" The Clerk of the Woods." Those who have 
already seen the brief chapters in the Boston 
" Evening Transcript " or the New York 
" Mail and Express " will be doubly glad to 
have them printed in this more permanent form. 
The title, which savors too much of the " desk's 
dull word " to bp. quite fair, is nevertheless

" expressive of the modest purpose of the writer, 
whose business was not to be witty or wise, but 
simply to ' keep the records.' " The records 
are kept from May to May, not only of the 
woods, but of birds and flowers, and (at least 
in outline) of mountain, meadow, and brook. 
They are kept, too, as part of life, and not as 
something remote. No one is more sensitive 
than Mr. Torrey to the reaction of out-of-door 
nature upon human nature ; nor does the inter- 
play often become too subtle for his power of 
words. Here is a prose poet who has the grace 
of walking and talking at the same time. You 
are unconscious of reading what he says ; rather 
you are. walking with him and listening, while 
he brings his delicate power of expression to 
the service of his love for nature. If the winter 
fire tempts you into analysis when " The Clerk " 
is finished and you have nothing else to do, you 
will realize that Mr. Torrey is not so scientific 
as Mr. John Burroughs. He does not pursue 
his subject so far, nor make you so certain that 
he knows the entire alphabet of it. Nor is he 
so philosophical as Thoreau, — not so bent on 
knowing the reason of things, nor so given to 
practical and common-sensible deductions from 
what he sees. He seldom turns the right side 
of out-door nature over, to show you the wrong 
side of human nature. His work is slight, per- 
haps, compared with that of either of these 
great men. But it is easy to be happy in his 
company. While you walk with him you know 
that bluebirds and violets are the really impor- 
tant things in life, and you are not oppressed 
either by your own ignorance or by dubious 
comparisons between nature and civilization. 
Of less general range and less literary excel- 
lence, but of no less healthiness and sincerity, 
is Mr. Walton's " A Hermit's Wild Friends." 
The writer's friends are the birds and small 
animals with whom (no one will be tempted to 
say with which, after reading the book) he has 
become acquainted in his eighteen years of life 
on Bond's Hill, Gloucester. "To some of these 
wild things," he says, " I am caterer, protector, 
and friend. They do not object to my presence 
when engaged in domestic affairs, so my ability 
to pry into their secrets is increased in ratio to 
the confidence accorded me." But the word 
"prying" quite belies the hermit's feeling. 
He and his proteges live together on terms of 
mutual respect and affection. The happy result 
is that be introduces us, not to species or groups, 
but to individuals. Wabbles, the song sparrow 
who for fourteen summers visits the door-yard, 
and confides to the hermit his sorrows over the 



death of the first Mrs. Wabbles, the hen-peck- 
ings of the second, and the loss of numerous 
nestlings ; and Tiny, the red squirrel who holds 
the premises for years against all other squir- 
rels and has various contests of wit with his 
protector, are both worth knowing. And so 
are all the hermit's other friends. Mr. Walton's 
stories about them are not exciting, but they 
have the stamp of truth which only long and 
sympathetic intimacy can give. Consequently 
they are the best sort both to enjoy and to make 
deductions from. 

The attitude of Mr. Long in "A Little 
Brother to the Bear " is confessedly somewhat 
different from Mr. Walton's. Mr. Walton is 
merely an observer. Mr. Long is both observer 
and interpreter. He believes that the natura- 
list " must collect his facts, at first hand if 
possible, and then he must interpret the facts 
as they appeal to his own head and heart in the 
light of all the circumstances that surround 
them." This is a perfectly possible theory, but 
in order to understand the application of it 
the reader should know just what is meant by 
interpretation. It is at this point that Mr. Long 
fails to make himself clear. There is no line of 
demarcation in his stories which says : " This 
is fact, for I saw it ; this is interpretation, for I 
only thought it." He makes as if perfectly equal 
in point of fact the two statements that the king- 
fisher hides her nest carefully on the bank of a 
stream, and that three young kingfishers he sees 
plying their trade together are playing a game 
to see which one can catch and swallow his fish 
first. He asserts with equal confidence that 
does rather than bucks usually lead the herd, 
and that the young deer he watched running in 
circles on the beach are " being taught to twist 
and double quickly." In each case, the first 
statement is fact, the second interpretation. It 
is through failure to make this distinction clear 
that Mr. Long has laid himself open to criticism 
by other naturalists. But whether the reader 
takes this matter seriously or not, he cannot fail 
to enjoy this new book. Mr. Long knows his 
animals well, loves them unfeignedly, and tells 
their stories artistically. The names he uses, 
which he says he has taken from the Milicete 
Indians, are a stroke of genius. Almost any- 
one, it would seem, could write stories under 
the inspiration of such names as Mooweesuk 
(raccoon), Mooween (bear), Whitooweek 
(woodcock), and K'dunk (toad). Yet it is 
doubtful if anyone, with or without the names, 
will soon write more entertaining stories than 
these.

Less skilful in treatment are the stories of 
coyotes, antelopes, prairie dogs, and other 
animals, in Miss Cook's " Along Four-Footed 
Trails." Among the multitude of animal 
books these children of the plains have scarcely 
received the attention they deserve. Miss Cook 
has seized upon much that is picturesque in 
their lives, for she has lived neighbor to them 
all, and knows their ways by heart. Her best 
stories are of a pet coyote and a tamed wild 
pony. Some of her other tales, about rabbits, 
beaver, mice, and buffalo in the wild, are told 
too discursively, and a few have the unfortu- 
nate tag of a human story that does not belong ; 
but they will be interesting, especially to chil- 
dren, even if the art displayed in them is not 
quite equal either to the knowledge or the 
sympathy. 

A little English bird-book from the pen of 
Mr. A. J. R. Roberts, forming one of a series 
of practical " Country Hand-books," is inter- 
esting partly by way of contrast to American 
books. After the tone which our best nature- 
writers take toward the birds — the tone which 
assumes that they are as human as we, — this 
English book sounds stiff and remote. Does 
the English genius preclude familiarity? Or 
must a book sound formal because it is a hand- 
book? However, it is pleasant to get the 
specialist's point of view toward nightingales, 
skylarks, and other songsters known to us be- 
fore only through the poets. Even more in- 
formation about those whose names we know 
best would not have been amiss. And the 
American reader wishes that at least a few 
comparisons between English and American 
birds might have been given, — but that was 
scarcely the object of the book. Its purely 
English destiny is evinced by the fact that 
more space and rather more appreciation are 
given to the English sparrow than to the 
thrush ! But though the text is less minute in 
description and less intimate in tone than an 
American hand-book would be, the balance is 
restored by photographs, many of which were 
taken by the author. The pictures of young 
blackbirds and jays are paralleled in Mrs. 
Wheelock's "Nestlings of Forest and Marsh," 
but we have nothing to equal the daring beauty 
of those which show kittewakes and razorbills, 
herrings and cormorants, in their nests on 
dizzy cliffs over the sea. 

Last in our list, but last only by reason of 
our prejudices, is Mrs. Patterson's spider-book, 
which she calls " The Spinner Family." A more 
delightful book was never written on an appa- 



rently less promising subject. Miss Muffet 
herself would have welcomed the immortal 
spider if it had been introduced in this author's 
charming manner. This is a case in which 
all of us who belong to an older generation — 
including Miss Muffet — must lay aside our 
prejudices, and let the children have their due. 
No child should be cheated out of acquaint- 
ance with Mrs. Epeira, Mrs. Grass-Spider, 
Mrs. Theridion, and all the other well-dressed 
and delicately industrious members of society 
celebrated in these pages. 

The writers of all of these recent nature- 
books believe in the reasoning power of the 
lower animals, some of them citing their be- 
lief with a joy akin to that of discovery. The 
belief and the joy are well ; but has someone 
forgotten what Darwin said long ago — that 
"a little dose of judgment or reason, as Pierre 
Huber expresses it, often comes into play, even 
with animals low in the scale of nature '? The 
truth is not new, except as it seems new when 
new manifestations of it are found. Another 
feeling which these nature-lovers have in com- 
mon is that of hatred for the man with the gun 
— in Mrs. Patterson's case, the woman witb 
the broom ; but that is very much the same 
thing. In view of man's inhumanity to brutes, 
it is no wonder that we find these lovers of wild 
life suggesting rather broadly that on the whole 
human nature is inferior to that of our feath- 
ered and four-footed kindred — that, as Mr. 
Walton puts it, " the feathered biped's hu- 
manity contrasts sharply with the human 
biped's brutality." 

It is inevitable that companionship with the 
beasts of the field and the birds of the air 
should foster pity for these creatures, who are 
subject at once to nature "red in tooth and 
claw," and to a lord of creation who carries a 
gun. Mr. Torrey and Mr. Walton are restrained 
in the expression of this pity, though they feel 
it deeply. Mr. Long and Miss Cook sometimes 
rather invite the reader to tears. It is here 
that nature-writers encounter their greatest 
danger. There is a point of pathos beyond 
which they should not go. Human nature that 
is worth anything has to bear a good deal of 
its own that is pitiful. It should not be weighed 
down, to no good purpose, with the groaning 
and travailing of the whole creation. Perhaps 
by another generation of nature- study in school 
and the reading of nature-books at home, we 
shall be able to eliminate the man with the 
gun. But it is not likely, no matter how much 
nature-writers make us feel the tragedies of the

struggle for existence, that we shall take to 
the woods to do sentinel duty over the victims 
of that struggle. Nor are we likely to take to 
the fields to learn our inferiority to the crea- 
tures who live there. It is the duty of the 
naturalists to keep us modest and teach us in 
this matter ; but it is also their duty to teach 
us without making us over-sad.

M What shall you give me, dear? " now that the happy time 
For the giving of gifts is near, when the bells of Christmas 

chime ; 
Friend of the steadfast eyes, friend of the loving look, 
Quickly my heart replies, "Always give me a book." 

For you and I know, dear heart, as the swift-wing'd years 

goby, 
And the valors of youth depart, and the waiting days draw 

nigh, 
What joy and cheer may come, in the quiet fireside nook, — 
The strife of the world shut out, — with a shaded lamp and 

a book. 

Then to our silent room come sounds of the woods and seas, 
Twitter of joyous birds, hum of the summer bees, — 
Lovers whose bliss we share, heroes whose brave deeds thrill 
Our hearts with the fires of youth, poets whose visions fill 

Our souls with a joy sublime, — infinite hope and desire, — 
Till the bonds of earth and time, the burdens that chafe and 

tire, 
Are loosed in the vision bright, and our souls transfigured 

stand, 
Illumed with the golden light that was " never on sea or land." 

Oh, the infinite fields of thought, where free from earth's 

stress and thrall 
We walk with the souls who have wrought, who have braved 

and conquered all ; 
Have won from sorrow and pain, from struggle, defeat, and 

loss, 
Snow from the crimson stain, crowns from the heavy cross. 

These are the souls we meet, and with them joy and aspire, 
As we sit at their sacred feet, by the quiet evening fire. . . . 
So, friend of the steadfast heart, friend of the loving look, 
When you would give me a gift, always give me a book.

Notable among the more substantial holiday pub- 
lications are " The Memoirs of D'Artagnan," for 
the first time translated into English by Mr. Ralph 
Nevill, and issued in a three-volume edition, lim- 
ited to five hundred copies, by Messrs. Little, 
Brown, & Co. It is now more than two hundred 
years since Courtilz de Sandras published his fas- 
cinating historical romance, claiming, as was his 
custom, that the work was an authentic memoir. 
In those two centuries the methods of biographers 
and historians have changed radically, and it is 
only too easy to dispose of Sandras's assumption of 
either title. But the vivacity and charm of this his 
masterpiece still remains, and so does Dumas's en- 
during tribute to it, — for in Sandras's pages he 
found " The Three Musketeers." This is not the 



place to speak in detail of Sandras's vivid picture 
of seventeenth-century France, of the relation of 
Dumas's work to his, nor of Mr. Nevill's excellent 
translation. This is unabridged, except in volume II., 
where certain passages having no connection with 
D'Artagnan's career have been compressed to suit 
modern taste. To holiday buyers, this edition will 
appeal by virtue of its attractive and yet substantial 
red-and-gold binding, and its illustrations, which are 
carefully selected portraits of fifteen of the prom- 
inent personages of the time. ' Louis XIII., Hen- 
rietta of France, Henrietta of England, Cardinal 
de Retz, Ninon de 1' Enclos, Anne of Austria, and 
the Comtede Guiche, are among the subjects. The 
portraits are reproduced on parchment, which gives 
them an antique air well suited to this quaint chron- 
icle of the old rSgime. 

One volume in the Macmillan Company's pic- 
torial series dealing with places and people has 
already been noticed among the holiday publications 
— Sir Gilbert Parker's "Old Quebec." Another 
new volume in the series is " Boston, the Place and 
the People," by Mr. M. A. DeWolfe Howe. Sir 
Gilbert Parker explains that for many years the 
history of Quebec was the history of New France ; 
Mr. Howe does not need to point out to good 
Americans a parallel case for Boston. The first 
chapters of the history thus present a difficult task ; 
and it is due to Mr. Howe to say that his treatment 
of the foundation of Boston and its colonial, pro- 
vincial, and revolutionary epochs is admirable in 
its grasp of essentials and in its avoidance, at the 
same time, of the appearance of a brief history of 
the United States. " The Hub and the "Wheel " 
chapter is a suggestive exposition of Boston's com- 
mercial enterprise. " The Boston Religion " is as 
clear and fair-minded a recital of the Unitarian 
controversy in brief form as we remember to have 
seen. Literary Boston is not forgotten, nor the 
. abolitionist movement, nor the civic energy of the 
city ; and the final chapter on "The Modern Inher- 
itance " shows the spirit of Boston to-day. The 
interest of the book rests on the same solid founda- 
tion of real worth that characterized "Old Quebec." 
There are many illustrations by Mr. Louis Holman, 
besides others from photographs. The latter in- 
clude portraits, autographs, quaint prints, and views 
of old and new Boston. 

Readers of " Stringtown on the Pike " will re- 
member the boy " Red Head," and will enjoy his 
story in full as Mr. John Uri Lloyd has now told it, 
in a holiday volume published by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. The primitive life of the Kentucky 
mountains of course furnishes the background for 
the plot. The feud around which it centres dates 
back to the wars of the Roses, but though its cause 
has long since been forgotten the terrible obligation 
of maintaining it is still binding. There is stirring 
adventure in the book, and a love story for variety. 
Mr. Lloyd vouehes for the accuracy of his picture 
of the Kentucky mountaineer, that curious and fast 
vanishing survival of a strange and lawless past, and

hopes that his story may possess a serious interest 
for students of Americana. The frontispiece is a 
picture of " Red Head " by Mr. Reginald Birch, 
who has made a number of other drawings and a 
border for every page. Mr. Birch's drawings are 
well executed and pleasing, but his page decorations 
are too heavy and elaborate for the best effect. 

"Warwick Castle and Its Earls" (Dutton) is a 
chronicle of all the lords of the line, both legendary 
and historic, written by the present Countess of 
Warwick. It is published in two bulky volumes 
whose solidity and mechanical perfection pay fit 
tribute to the dignity of their theme. For a history 
of the house of Warwick comes close to being a 
history of England. The castle is nearly as old as 
the nation, and its earls have played a part in all 
the most conspicuous dramas of the nation's history. 
They have been prominent in foreign and civil 
wars; they appear as the hosts of kings and again 
as their executioners; they have dictated the law 
of the land and bowed to its majesty on the scaffold. 
The Countess has found one earl who was a pirate, 
and a pretender to the earldom who invented a 
valuable patent medicine. So the history lacks 
neither largeness of interest nor variety. The 
author has had access to all available sources. 
The text is annotated, appendices furnish genea- 
logical tables and reproduce documents of special 
interest, and there is a full index. The many beau- 
tiful illustrations show Warwick Castle in every 
stage of its development, portray the earls and 
countesses and their friends, and reproduce all sorts 
of interesting relics. Portraits in photogravure of 
the author and her husband form the frontispieces. 
The book will interest anyone who traces his de- 
scent from a branch of this great house, and others 
who enjoy the more intimate disclosures of history. 
The fine binding of polished green buckram, stamped 
with the family coat of arms, and the abundant pic- 
tures, will commend the work to holiday buyers. 

In two small volumes, handsomely bound in 
polished red buckram and boxed together, Mr. 
Charles M. Skinner gives us an interesting collec- 
tion of "American Myths and Legends" (Lippin- 
cott). In the preface, Mr. Skinner confesses to 
once having thought his previous work, " Myths 
and Legends of Our Own Land," fairly complete; 
but these full and fascinating volumes disprove that 
supposition. The new volumes include Indian folk- 
tales, beast-lore, ghost and spectre stories, traditions 
that have named our towns, added words to our 
vocabulary, or romantic associations to our land- 
scape, with much besides. Each legend is briefly 
and clearly told, without much comment or any strict 
classification. The abundant and interesting ma- 
terial here presented will no doubt surprise many 
readers. Each volume has a photogravure frontis- 
piece, with four or five half-tones, showing char- 
acteristic bits of scenery in different sections of the 
country. 

" Stately Homes in America " (Appleton) is a 
large and imposing volume, whose object is to pic- 



ture and explain the various types of houses that 
the American multi-millionaire inhabits. The text, 
consisting of a popular account of the colonial, 
transitional, and modern styles of domestic archi- 
tecture, i3 written by Messrs. Harry W. Desmond 
and Herbert Croly. The pictures, more than a 
hundred and fifty in number, are from photo- 
graphs showing interior and exterior views of old 
colonial homes and modern palatial residences in 
New York and Philadelphia, at Newport, on the 
Hudson, and on Long Island, with a few in other 
localities. The typical and the magnificent rather 
than the unique or artistic seem to be the subject 
of both text and pictures. The book will appeal to 
those who take an intelligent interest in the de- 
velopment of this phase of our architectural ideal. 
Its sumptuousness of make-up and its beautiful 
pictures will commend it to holiday buyers. 

A book intended for the gratification of the 
Beardsley cult is "Under the Hill and Other Essays 
in Prose and Verse," being Mr. John Lane's compi- 
lation of such of the literary and artistic remains of 
his friend Aubrey Beardsley as had not hitherto 
appeared among the artist's published works. 
"Under the Hill " is a whimsical bit of narrative 
describing the visit of the "loving Abbe Faufre- 
luche " to the " Venusberg." It has the sensuous 
suggestion, the satiric turn, and the brilliantly ar- 
tistic touch that is characteristic of everything 
Beardsley put his hand to. Five of his drawings 
furnish the illustrations. Two eccentric ballads, a 
translation from Catullus, reminiscences of Beards- 
ley's table-talk, and two letters make up the rest of 
the literary remains. Several hitherto unpublished 
drawings and a photogravure portrait of Beardsley 
at Mentone are included among the illustrations. 
Mr. Lane, in a publisher's preface, gives an inter- 
esting account of Beardsley's connection with " The 
Yellow Book " and an estimate of his genius and his 
relation to the development of the art of black and 
white. The feeling that is uppermost as one closes 
this sumptuous memorial volume is perhaps aston- 
ishment that the davs of " The Yellow Book " seem 
so far behind us. Yet the very fact that progress 
in line drawing has lately been so rapid makes a 
backward glance interesting; and since Beardsley 
died at twenty-six, all that he did is surely not too 
much by which to judge him. 

In spite of an imposing bibliography, an elaborate 
index, and the dignity of a two-volume edition, it is 
impossible to regard Mr. Rupert Hughes's "Love 
Affairs of Great Musicians " with much seriousness. 
The style is both careless and flippant, straining 
after sensation and ignoring the canons of good 
taste. " Heart-busy" (p. 68), "Musickers " (p. 98), 
and "readeress" (vol. II., p. 256), together with 
this sentence, "Sand was the former of the two to 
fall in love " (vol. II., p. 297), will illustrate the 
author's unfortunate mannerisms. As for his flip- 
pancy, it is possible that, not sympathizing with 
the popular interest in the love affairs of famous 
men, he has made a etude attempt to put the sub-

ject on what he considers its proper plane. Bat the 
prefatory note, calling attention to the timeliness of 
the book in view of many recent contributions to 
the subject, sounds serious, and the long list of au- 
thorities consulted shows industry, which, rightly 
directed, ought to have produced an entertaining 
and profitable study, and even now has not been 
wholly without interesting results. The best chap- 
ters are naturally those on well-known musicians. 
It seems unnecessary, to say the least, to include 
myths of Orpheus, Pan, and Apollo in such a book, 
and the " Omnibus Chapter " is too general to be of 
value. The conclusion is too long for a summary, 
and its main thesis — that the musician may be 
noble or the reverse, like any other man — hardly 
needed a two-volume proof. The publishers (L. C 
Page & Co.), who bring out this book as a part 
of their "Music Lovers' Series," have provided 
abundant illustrations, decorated end-papers, and 
an ornate binding. 

An exceedingly interesting contribution to the 
history of modern French art is made available to 
readers of English by Mr. P. G. Konody's transla- 
tion of Monsieur Camille Mauclair's "Great French 
Painters." The sub-title, " The Evolution of French 
Painting from 1830 to the Present Day," gives a 
clearer idea of the author's intention. The transla- 
tion is published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. in 
a well-bound folio, with lavish illustration from the 
work 8 of the modern French schools. The paintings 
of Monet, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Millet, and Puvis 
de Chavannes are accorded fullest representation 
among the hundred and ten half-tone reproductions. 
M. Mauclair's sympathies are clearly with the mod- 
ern schools — the symbolists, impressionists, and 
intimists. But this bias is so frankly stated that it 
cannot mislead the reader, and it serves to lend color 
and interest to the exposition. The programme of 
the book is vast, covering as it does seventy years 
of great progress. This confused body of material 
is, however, unified by the attempt to show how, 
since the days of Ingres and Delacroix, French art 
has grown steadily more national and also more 
individual ; and how the great masters like Corot, 
Courbet, Millet, Manet, and Degas, arraying them- 
selves against the claims of a pseudo-classicism, have 
become both the real upholders of tradition and the 
advance guard of the evolutionary movement in favor 
of personal and national freedom in subject-matter 
and method. This evolution is traced through chap- 
ters dealing with its successive phases. A word of 
praise should be said for the translator, who has 
succeeded in preserving the flexibility and compact- 
ness which are characteristic of the French critical 
style. 

Last year we had a beautiful reprint of Thack- 
eray's arraignment of the Christmas Annuals, the 
atrocious " table-books " of his time. This year 
another neglected satire, " Reading a Poem," has 
been reprinted in a limited edition by the A. Wessels 
Company. This sketch, which originally appeared 
in a weekly paper called " The Brittania," has been 



reprinted only twice before. In May, 1891, fifty 
years after its first publication, it was printed among 
the " opuscula " of the " Sette of Odd Volumes," 
and in 1897 it was issued in a limited edition by 
Mr. De Vinne. The fact that the piece was com- 
pletely lost sight of for so long is strange, inasmuch 
as it is specifically stated to be by " Mr. Michael 
Angelo Titmarsh," is characteristic in style and sub- 
ject, and introduces the ever-welcome " Yellow- 
plush." The text of the present reprint is from a 
copy of "The Odd Volumes," an interesting account 
of which is contained in the preface. The frontis- 
piece is a photogravure portrait of Thackeray. The 
book is printed on fine deckle-edged paper, and 
bound in plain green boards. It will be a treasure 
to the collector. 

For a bibliophile of fastidious taste in the matter 
of fine printing, no more acceptable gift could pos- 
sibly be found among the season's books than the 
reprint of More's " Utopia," published by the Scott- 
Thaw Co. in their " Library of Noble Authors.' - " 
Printed at the Chiswick Press, London, in an edi- 
tion limited to 200 copies for America, the series 
of which this is the second volume represents the 
highest attainments in modern typography and book- 
making. The folio form, the dignified typography,, 
the impressive effect of beautiful handmade paper 
and generous margins, are peculiarly appropriate to 
the text in the present reprint. The second (1556) 
edition of Ralph Robynson's translation is here fol- 
lowed, in all its archaic spelling and punctuation ; 
Roper's life of More, collated and edited by Mr. 
George Sampson, and a selection from his family 
letters, are also included in the volume. A splendid 
photogravure from Holbein's portrait serves as 
frontispiece, and there is a graceful title-page de- 
sign in line drawing by Mr. W. L. Bruckman. It 
is safe to say that More's noble vision was never 
clothed more fittingly than in this noble edition. 

Equally commendable as a piece of good printing, 
though less imposing and less expensive, is a reprint 
of Emerson's " Conduct of Life," also a product of 
the Chiswick Press and issued by the Scott-Thaw 
Co. The text, presented without editorial accom- 
paniment of any sort, is set in a simple old style face 
of type, large and easily read, and printed with gen- 
erous margins on Dutch handmade paper. The 
binding is a pleasing combination of linen cloth and 
vellum, heavily stamped in gold. A Christmas gift 
of more intrinsic value, especially for the young, 
could not be desired. The edition is limited to 350 
copies. 

Mr. Roy Rolfe Gilson's "In the Morning Glow " 
was a new and charming type of the literature of 
childhood. The two favorite sketches in the book, 
"Mother" and "Father," have now been reprinted 
separately in a beautiful volume (Harper), with 
pictures and marginal designs by Mrs. Alice Bar- 
bour Stephens. The eight full-page illustrations are 
printed in a soft brown tint, and neatly mounted on 
blank pages of the book, without damage to which 
they might easily be detached for framing. They

are certainly worthy of preservation in this way. 
The borders are very pretty, but the cover shows a 
tendency, too common in holiday editions, to an 
excess of ornament. 

Another lavishly illustrated book about childhood 
is Mr. Walter Russell's u Bending of the Twig " 
(Dodd, Mead & Co.). Mr. Russell explains that 
the purport of his book is not to show how the 
u grown-ups " should mould the lives of children, 
but how, inevitably, the children mould the lives of 
the " grown-ups." As a matter of fact the book 
suggests answers to both these questions, and inci- 
dentally gives a clue to Mr. Russell's power of 
understanding and drawing children. He can tell 
them fascinating stories and — what is a rarer gift 
— can make them tell him even better ones in 
return. His tales generally have the realistic back- 
ground that children love, and often deftly conceal 
a moral which some of the children in the book are 
amazingly meek in accepting. However in the main 
they are real children, — particularly the boys, — 
and they have ample reason for being, apart from 
the fact that they are the originals of the pictures, 
which are naturally the main features of a book by 
Mr. Russell. There are about fifty of these draw- 
ings, each representing a different mood or aspect 
of childhood. Marginal sketches on every page 
supplement the full-page portraits by helping to 
make the book abound from cover to cover in the 
joyous spirit of childhood. Mr. Russell's work is 
too well known to need praise. He has put some 
of the best of it into this volume, which is unique 
among the holiday publications. 

A book full of the joys of youth and spring-time 
is "On the Road to Arcady" (Revell), by Miss 
Mabel Nelson Thurston, with frontispiece, decorated 
end-papers, headings, and marginal drawings in 
pen-and-ink by Mr. Samuel M. Palmer, a member 
of the artists' colony at Wilmington, Delaware. Mr. 
Palmer's work on the inside of the book is original 
and pleasing ; but he has overloaded the cover with 
ornament until it is bewildering rather than impres- 
sive. The story takes the form of a journal written 
by an eccentric but very attractive middle-aged 
woman, with a love for nature and for solitude. 
The former taste is strengthened, the latter for the 
time entirely obliterated, by the advent of a fasci- 
nating young cousin. The latter overturns all the 
older woman's habits, fills her quiet house with 
young men, induces her to adopt two waifs from an 
orphan asylum, and finally wins the heart of a bach- 
elor cousin for whom, we are led to believe, the dia- 
rist has cherished a secret fondness. If ho, she 
accepts the situation with commendable tranquility, 
considering, no doubt, that the joys of spring-time 
in Arcady still remain to her. The story is grace- 
fully told, with plenty of humor and a keen appre- 
ciation of the charm of the out-door world and the 
vagaries of human nature. 

Two companion volumes whose charm the lover 
of choice editions will be quite unable to resist, 
are "The Essays of Douglas Jerrold " with an edi- 



torial preface by his grandson, Mr. Walter Jerrold, 
and "The Essays of Leigh Hunt," edited by Mr. 
Arthur Symons, both volumes being illustrated by 
Mr. H. M. Brock, and published by Messrs. J. M. 
Dent & Co. (imported by Dutton). The plain silk 
cloth cover with a gold monogram as its only deco- 
ration has an air of quaintness and distinction that 
is quite in keeping with the contents of these two 
little volumes. Mr. Brock's pen and ink drawings 
will be a surprise even to those who know his work 
best. Their dainty finish, quaintness of conception, 
delicate humor, and perfect appreciation of the 
text are as unusual as they are delightful. Each 
of the essays has a head and a tail piece, and these 
are quite as carefully wrought and as illustrative 
as the other drawings. Paper and printing are all 
that could be wished, and these volumes are easily 
among the half dozen ■ best things " of the holiday 
season. 

The volume entitled " Through the Gates of Old 
Romance " (Lippincott), by Mr. W. Jay Mills, is 
made very attractive by a cover of heavy white 
buckram and many pictures of the belles and beaux 
of bygone days. The absence of a preface leaves 
us in doubt about Mr. Mills's claims to historical 
authenticity, but apparently the nine stories which 
make up the volume are historical novelettes, with 
a foundation of fact and a considerable superstruc- 
ture of fancy. The stories of the Franklin family's 
connivance at an elopement, of Philip Freneau's 
poetic courtship, and of Pinderina Scribblerus, 
poetess of Perth Amboy, are among the best. In 
all the tales the quaint picturesqueness and the 
romantic gaiety of colonial life in America is 
strongly brought out. The very dainty and allur- 
ing form of the book is appropriate to the holiday 
season. 

A book to delight the few who care for such things 
is " The Life of Saint Mary Magdalen " (John 
Lane), a translation, by Miss Valentina Hawtrey, 
of a fourteenth-century Italian manuscript of un- 
known authorship. In the introduction, Vernon 
Lee classes this devotional romance with "Aucassin 
et Nicolette " as " one of the absolutely satisfactory 
works, so few but so exquisite, of the middle ages." 
This is high praise ; but the quaint and charming 
narrative, with its interesting psychology, seems to 
merit it. The legend is that Mary Magdalen was 
the sister of Lazarus, and was married to John the 
Evangelist, who deserted her on her wedding-day 
to follow Christ to the desert. The recent stage 
interpretation of another version of the same story 
gives timeliness to the translation of this medieval 
legend, which, however, needs no extrinsic sources 
of interest. The illustrations, showing the Mag- 
dalen as fourteen great painters have conceived her, 
are a beautiful and impressive commentary on the 
text. The binding is quaint and dignified. 

" Gardens of the Caribbees, — Sketches of a 
Cruise to the West Indies and the Spanish Main " 
reads the title-page of two daintily proportioned 
volumes written by Mrs. Ida M. H. Starr, and 



474 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



published with many illustrations by Messrs. L. C. 
Page & Co. as a part of their " Travel Lovers' 
Library." Before she started on her cruise, Mrs. 
Starr had thought of the Caribbees as veritable 
Islands of the Blest. On the first day out she de- 
cided that Mr. Kipling was quite right about the 
impossibility of reaching them by any steamship 
line. But a few days later she landed at Haiti, 
a.nd began to realize most, if not all, of her dreams. 
Mrs. Starr was accompanied on her journey by her 
husband and two small daughters, and they, with 
friends made on the way, play a considerable part 
in the narrative, which is written in a simple, chatty 
style, with the emphasis on the people of the islands 
and their ways of life and thought. The recent 
desolation wrought by Mount Pele"e gives these 
volumes a certain timeliness, and their artistic form 
will make them acceptable gift-books. 

The volume entitled " My Favorite Book-Shelf " 
(Paul Elder & Co.) will prove an acceptable gift for 
a busy friend who, having little time or taste for 
thorough reading, likes to get some small knowledge 
of the world's prose literature by means of brief 
selections. The compiler, Mr. Charles Josselyn, 
does not claim for his anthology any basis of selec- 
tion beyond his own choice and a due attention to 
variety. The authors represented are as diverse as 
Schopenhauer and Macaulay, " Ouida " and Doctor 
Johnson, Mr. Robert Grant and Charles Lamb ; 
but most of them are classic writers. The selections 
are brief — often only a paragraph or two — but 
complete in thought. They are generally expository, 
and in spite of the diversity of subject-matter and 
point of view most of them touch on the authors' 
philosophy of life. The compilation would lose none 
of its popular character, and be much more useful 
for reference, had the name of the work from which 
each selection was chosen been given. The book 
is handsomely bound. 

If Mr. Howard Chandler Christy were not so 
successful in picturing the fashionable world of 
to-day, we should be inclined to judge his Puritans 
and Indians more leniently. His illustrations for 
the new holiday edition of " The Courtship of Miles 
Standish " (Bobbs-Merrill) are very pretty but they 
do not fit the text. John Alden looks as if he had 
stepped out of a New York drawing-room, the rest 
of the characters are stiff and unreal, and the In- 
dians positively grotesque. Of the forty-odd illus- 
trations nine are in color, and there are besides 
decorations on every page and a special cover de- 
sign. The paper is of excellent quality and the 
type attractive. It is a pity that so much trouble 
should have been spent to so little purpose, but 
doubtless many of Mr. Christy's admirers will be 
loyal enough to like his latest departure, and to 
commend the publishers' choice of an illustrator 
for Longfellow. 

"Colonel's Carter's Christmas" (Scribner), with 
Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith's ingenious explanation 
of its late arrival as preface, and several daintily 
colored illustrations by Mr. F. C. Yohn, is sure to 



be popular among the holiday books. Some of the 
Colonel's friends may question Mr. Smith's wisdom 
in attempting this revival, but they will find little 
justification for their fears. The story deserves to 
rank with the rest of the Carter chronicles ; it will 
please the Colonel's old friends, and make him new 
ones. Mr. Yohn's illustrations and the pretty cover 
design emphasize the Christmas spirit that pervades 
the story. 

In "The Forest," whose chapters will be familiar 
to readers of "The Outlook," Mr. Stewart Edward 
White has achieved the difficult task of writing an 
outdoor book in a new way. The thread which 
holds it together is the story of a thousand-mile 
canoe trip through the woods of Canada and 
Northern Michigan. But in addition to chapters 
of experience and adventure there are practical 
hints to would-be campers, character sketches of 
Habitants and Indians, and suggestive analyses of 
" the call of the wild " and the subtle spell that the 
" blazed trail " casts over its captives. " One cannot 
imprison the Forest inside the covers of a book," 
says Mr. White, and this is true ; yet there is a 
great deal of the composite, changeful spirit of the 
great woods within these covers. " The Forest " 
is beautifully illustrated and decorated by Mr. 
Thomas Fogarty, a friend of the author and his 
companion on the trip of which this book is the 
outcome. 

The work of Miss Esther Singleton in compiling 
descriptive passages by great writers under various 
attractive headings has obtained wide recognition. 
She has this year edited and arranged a new volume 
(the sixth in her series), called " Historic Buildings 
Described by Great Writers " (Dodd, Mead & Co.). 
The buildings dealt with have been chosen for their 
artistic beauty or interest, and also for their his- 
torical associations. None of those already described 
in"Turret8, Towers, and Temples" or "Romantic 
Castles and Palaces " are included in the new vol- 
ume. The buildings are of all periods and many 
countries, and the commentators as diverse as G. W. 
Steevens, Dickens, Pierre Loti, Ruskin, Gautier, and 
Gibbon. There are forty-two excellent illustrations 
in half-tone, and the binding is uniform with the rest 
of the series. 

Holiday editions of " Mrs. Wiggs " and " Lovey 
Mary " were the only logical outcome of the popu- 
larity of the Cabbage- Patch heroines, and they have 
just been issued by the Century Co. The pretty 
cloth binding, with gold lettering, is uniform for 
both volumes, in each of which are two dozen 
drawings, half in color and half in black-and-white, 
by Mrs. Florence Scovel Shinn, whose clever work 
in the original edition of " Lovey Mary " assured a 
welcome for her additional drawings in this larger 
edition, and for the entirely new set of pictures in 
" Mrs. Wiggs." It is difficult to believe that any- 
body who reads current books has overlooked Mrs. 
Rice's stories, but there will be many to enjoy re- 
reading them in their holiday setting. The two 
volumes are neatly boxed together.

The special winter number of " The Studio " 
takes the form of a richly illustrated brochure on 
"The Genius of J. M. W. Turner" (John Lane). 
From many sources a large and representative 
selection of the drawings, paintings, and engravings 
of Turner has been gathered ; a collection repre- 
senting every period of the artist's career and every 
type of his work. There are sixteen plates in color, 
a facsimile letter from Turner to his father, two 
portraits, and nearly one hundred and fifty other 
beautiful reproductions. Four essays upon the art- 
ist's various modes of work furnish the text. The 
volume will make a holiday gift that should be 
acceptable in many quarters. It is well worthy of 
a substantial and artistic binding. 

Twenty of Mr. Paul Laurence Dunbar's dialect 
poems are published in holiday form by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co., under the title of the first piece 
in the collection, " When Malindy Sings." Like 
" Candle-Lightin' Time " by the same author, the 
book is uniquely illustrated from photographs taken 
by the Hampton Institute Camera Club, and deco- 
rated with marginal borders by Miss Margaret 
Armstrong. The photographs are in excellent taste, 
being humorous but dignified, with none of the 
burlegque suggestion that turns bo many pictures 
of negro life into caricature. A few very beautiful 
landscape views add variety to the illustrations. 
Of the poems, it is only necessary to say that they 
are in the same delightful vein which has won for 
Mr. Dunbar so enviable a reputation as a poet of 
his own people. 

"Reflections of the Morning After" (H. M. 
Caldwell Co.), written and illustrated by Mr. 
Herman Lee Meader, is a pocket volume appro- 
priately bound in highly-colored calico, with a 
symbolic and also highly-colored heading. The 
decorated end-papers are in the same lurid style, 
but the title-page and marginal borders are illus- 
trative of the author's mood without being ugly. 
The " Reflections," which are grouped under such 
headings as " Alcoholic Fumes," " Grouches and 
Grins," and "The Lockstep " (marriage), are 
always well put and sometimes very pithy, but 
more often only sharply cynical, and occasionally 
vulgar. It would possibly idealize " The Morning 
After " to omit this last element altogether, but 
it would have made a better book. However, by 
judicious choosing one can get considerable good 
philosophy from Mr. Meader's " Reflections." 

For the last six or seven years Mr. Bliss Carman 
has been writing essays for newspapers and period- 
icals. Some of these he has pruned and gathered 
into a volume entitled "The Kinship of Nature," 
now published, with a photogravure frontispiece of 
the author, by Messrs. L. C. Page & Co. The essays, 
which are short and informal, follow no continuous 
trend of thought, though they are unified by the 
author's cheerful philosophy, which the " Songs from 
Vagabondia " and the rest of his verse have made 
familiar. Such titles as " The Art of Life," "The 
Crime of Ugliness," " April in Town," " The Wan- 



dering Word," " The Courtesy of Nature," and 
" Trees " will give the reader who is unfamiliar with 
the author's prose style some notion of what he may 
expect. 

Mr. John Luther Long's " Madame Butterfly " 
is offered to holiday buyers in a new "Japanese 
edition " (Century Co.). The piquant charm of 
the story is known to many readers, and to play- 
goers as well ; for it has long since been dramatized, 
and now — so Mr. Long's preface tells us — the 
Italian composer, Signor Puccini, is writing an 
opera with " Madame Butterfly " as the libretto. 
The new edition is printed on heavy paper, with 
wide margins, and illustrated with very artistic 
photographs of Japanese subjects, taken by Mr. 
C. Y. Abbott, an amateur photographer of Phila- 
delphia. The cover design is the most authentically 
Japanese feature, being made by a native artist, 
Genjiro Yeto. 

A beautiful edition of William Morris's " Defense 
of Guenevere, and Other Poems " is issued by Mr. 
John Lane, with many illustrations and decorations 
by Miss Jessie M. King. The designs have much 
of the spirit of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, though 
Miss King's use of the fantastic, sweeping line is 
more suggestive of Aubrey Beardsley. Altogether 
the edition will be pleasing to admirers of William 
Morris's work. It contains about thirty of his 
shorter poems, printed on excellent paper, with gilt 
top and uncut edges, and bound in red and gold. 

Miss Carolyn Wells's "Nonsense Anthology " has 
already become in its way a classic. Everybody who 
cares for nonsense verse approves of Miss Wells's 
choice and wants to own the handy little collection 
of favorite pieces. Because of its great popularity 
as a gift-book, the publishers (Scribner) have now 
issued a holiday edition, prettily bound in full limp 
leather and printed on thin paper. The new edition 
is certain to be a favorite one. 

Miss Marie Corelli wields so versatile a pen that 
it is impossible to declare any sort of literary work 
out of her range. But we may safely say that 
" Angel's Wickedness," the booklet which she has 
furnished for holiday consumption, is hardly char- 
acteristic — except of her versatility. " Angel's 
Wickedness " is a " true " story of the Sunday- 
school book order, with a heroine who becomes at 
the end of the short tale as angelic in nature as 
she had previously been in name. There are no 
illustrations, but the heavy paper, wide margins, 
and gray board-cover with its pretty gold stamp, 
give the little book a festive air, and the moral of 
the story has a Christmas turn. (New York: 
Walter R. Beers.) 

" Little Henry's Slate," by Mr. W. D. Nesbit, is 
a collection of the choicest of Little Henry's sayings, 
published in a unique booklet by Mr. William S. 
Lord. Chicago newspaper readers will remember 
these juvenile epigrams and enjoy seeing them 
realistically printed in reproduction of Henry's own 
work and illustrated by the same hand. Every 
other page of the book contains a saying and is deco-

which will serve as a sample of the rest, reads : 
"My Paw ses a man is never to oled to lurn & wim- 
men is never to yung to teech him." 

The 1904 edition of " The Cynic's Calendar of 
Revised Wisdom " (Paul Elder & Co.) will appeal 
to many holiday shoppers in search of a unique and 
inexpensive gift. As before, Mr. Oliver Herford, 
Miss Ethel Watts Mumford, and Mr. Addison 
Mizner have collaborated in its preparation. The 
general form of the calendar, with its checked ging- 
ham cover and poster label, red and black decora- 
tions, and blank pages for memoranda, has been 
retained ; but the illustrations are different and 
much better than those of last year, and many new 
bite of wisdom have been revised for 1904. M Eat 
your steak or you '11 have stew "; " Consistency, thou 
art a mule ! "; " Many hands want light work," are 
a few of the new " twisted " proverbs. If enjoyment 
of " The Cynic's Calendar " is a test, most of us 
must confess to being cynics.

Literature for children has received so 



few additious of decided merit this sea- 
sou that the publication just at this time 
of Miss Josephine Preston Peabody's "The Singing 
Leaves" (Houghton) calls for a word of especial com- 
ment. This is not a book inteuded as a whole for 
younger folk, but one of its chapters, " The Little Past," 
is designed for small people, and another, " The Young 
Things," for young girls. Of the eleven titles in the 
former chapter, the pieces called "Journey," "The 
Busy Child," " The Masterpiece," " Late," and one or 
two more, deserve all the good that can be said of them. 
The distich, " Concerning Love," may be quoted. 
" I wish she would not ask ma if I love the Kitten more 
than her. 
Of course I love her. But I love the Kitten too : and It 
has fur." 
Of the other chapter mentioned, it may be said to form 
perhaps the only poetio interpretation of the life of 
young girls as revealed by one of themselves. Mr. 
Norman Gale has doue what a young man can to inform 
his brethren of that enviable and delicious life, but it 
has been reserved for Miss Peabody to reach the heart 
of the matter. For the delightful mingling of moods 
which constitutes humor at its best, " Vanity, Saith the 
Preacher," a little poem on a young girl's frocks and 
footwear, deserves high praise. 

Mr. Howard Pyle, preserving something 
mmdkiti*ry. °* th «? archaic speech of Mallory aud all 

of his archaic spirit, has rewritten from 
that great original "The Story of King Arthur and his 
Knights " (Scribner), and provided as well the brilliaut 
series of drawings with which it is illustrated. The 
result is a volume unusually harmonious and of extra- 
ordinary literary and artistic value. The whole round of 
the Arthurian myth is not here exhausted either, leaving 
a prospect of another volume in the future. — Miss Eva 
March Tappan has left for a time the more serious field 
of history, which she has been so busily rejuvenating for 
youthful readers, and now gives us " Robiu Hood: His 



Book " (Little, Brown, & Co.), bringing into one volume 
all the old ballads and folk-tales concerning the prince 
of robbers. There are many outline drawings in the 
text, and six full-page pictures in color, all from the 
skilful baud of Miss Charlotte Harding. — Four stories 
addressed to half-grown children, written by Miss 
Evaleen Stein, are published under the title of " Trou- 
badour Tales" (Bobbs-Merrill). Three are from old 
France, and one, relating to the discovery of a lost canto 
of the "Kalevala," from Finland. This last is a rare 
bit of work, while all show Miss Stein's knowu poetio 
qualities. The illustrations are numerous, being the 
work of Miss Virginia Keep and Messrs. Maxtield 
Parrish, B. Rosenmeyer, and Edward Edwards. — From 
the profound erudition of the Rev. H. Pereira Meudes 
comes " In Old Egypt: A Story about the Bible but not 
in the Bible " (Stokes), with abundant illustrations by 
Miss Mabel L. Humphrey. The book coucerns itself 
with the coming of the prophet Moses into the world, 
beginning with the deeds of his father Am rani and 
carrying the tale as supplementary to the scriptural 
narrative on through numerous interesting episodes of 
the life of the Hebrews in the days of the Pharaonic 
captivity. Nothing but good can result from a book 
so conceived and written. — In Mr. William Henry 
Johnson's " Pioneer Spaniards in North America " 
(Little, Brown, & Co.) may be obtained a great deal 
of succinct and accurate history relating to Ojeda, 
Amerigo Vespucius, Balboa, Pouce de Leou, Las Casas, 
Cortes, Narvaez, Coronado, aud De Soto. There are 
numerous illustrations from portraits and scenes in 
ancient books discussing the doughty deeds of these 
explorers. As a bit of Americana for the young, the 
book should find an appreciative audience. — Copious 
excerpts from typical speeches of oue of the greater 
American statesmen maybe found in "Daniel Webster 
for Young Americans" (Little, Brown, & Co.), an 
introduction being provided by Mr. Charles F. Richard- 
son, the editor, who has also included Whipple's essay 
on " Webster as a Master of English Style," aud added 
the Declaration of Independence, the federal constitu- 
tion, and Washington's " Farewell Address." Numerous 
portraits of Webster at different stages of his career, 
and pictures of scenes in which he was an actor, illus- 
trate the book, which is a worthy contribution to 
the knowledge of a man whose greatness was always 
human. — The first volume of " Famous Battles of the 
Nineteenth Century " (Wessels), edited by Mr. Charles 
Welsh, begins with Nelson at Copenhagen and ends with 
the battle of Waterloo. It is both a conclusive and 
various work. Several of the accounts are from dis- 
tinguished hands, such as Sir Walter Scott's story of 
Napoleon's overthrow; but most of them are the work 
of contemporary writers, such as G. A. Heuty, Archi- 
bald Forbes, and others. The conflicts between the 
United States and Great Britain are told from the 
American point of view, aud those of Great Britain 
with other nations from the Euglish side; so that the 
English-speaking peoples have much the best of the 
argument in every sense of the word. The volume is 
fully and attractively illustrated.

authors are evidently in sympathy with England rather 
than Ireland. — The late Paul du Chaillu left " In Afri- 
can Forest and Jungle " (Scribner) behind him, and 
seemingly as a reminder of the field in which he attained 
his first popularity. It is in his earliest manner, telling 
interestingly and convincingly of the adventures of a 
European naturalist in the darker parts of the dark 
continent. The pictures, by Mr. Victor Perard, represent 
the hero, his native assistant, and their dog in various 
difficult situations. — " With the Treasure Seekers: A 
Tale of the Florida Cays" (Lippincott) is a story of 
some gold and silver bars which were not found, and 
some plate made of precious metals which was, the 
party of discoverers setting forth in a private steam 
yacht and having numerous exciting times before they 
returned to New York again, a shipwreck being the last 
of their troubles. The book is illustrated, and is a good 
example of Mr. James Otis's writing at its best Al- 
most the earliest and one of the greatest of American 
industries concerns itself with the felling of forests, 
which has doubtless led Mr. Edward Stratemeyer to 
the writing of "Two Young Lumbermen; or, From 
Maine to Oregon for Fortune " (Lee & Shepard). It 
has two young men for its heroes, and these hardy and 
hearty Maine Yankees work from their native state 
across the continent to Oregon by way of Michigan, 
achieving success at last through a contract with a rail- 
way, after many difficulties. The book is a romance 
of contemporary business life. Mr. A. B. Shute pro- 
vides the pictures. — A few stories of life at school may 
be included here, notably a book about the National Mil- 
itary Academy called " West Point Colors" (Revell). 
It is written by Mrs. Anna B. Warner, with the active 
cooperation of a number of the cadets themselves, and 
gains thereby a reality attainable in no other way. The 
only illustrations are from photographs. — " Riverton 
Boys: A Story of Two Schools " (Nelson) is an amusing 
book by Messrs. K. M. Eady and R. Eady. One school 
is aristocratic, the other a seminary of learning where 
the pupils actually learn. The rivalry is intense, and 
involves two cousins, one in each of the opposing schools, 
in some curious little scrapes. The end comes with the 
boys on the battlefield. — For somewhat smaller boys 
Mr. Harold Avery has written " The House on the 
Moor" (Nelson), also an English school story wherein 
a careless boy loses his overcoat containing a valuable 
letter of his father's, in recovering which he succeeds 
in bringing an escaped convict to justice. The story is 
mildly sensational. — Here may also be included " The 
Ship of State: By Those at the Helm " (Ginn), a useful 
series of accounts of the manner in which government 
governs in this country, republished from the pages of 
" The Youth's Companion " and fully authenticated by 
the names of the contributors to the little book, repre- 
senting the present executive department of the federal 
government most fully. 

A large number of this season's books 
have been addressed particularly to girls 
of all sizes and ages. At the head of this 
supplementary list may be placed Mrs. Mabel Osgood 
Wright's " Aunt Jimmy's Will " (Macmillan). It is 
the story of a small gentlewoman who is left seemingly 
destitute in a small New England town by the death of 
her widowed father, a highly unsuccessful artist of Irish 
extraction. In spite of the determination of a kindly 
farmer near by to give her a home, she is taken by her 
uncle to a New York flat of the grade just above a 
tenement, and there remains until the kindly farmer's

wife and her son, between them, make her return pos- 
sible. The contrast between the healthy life of the 
country and the strenuosities of the metropolis is viv- 
idly drawn, and Mrs. Wright is given the opportunity 
to do some delightful character painting. Mrs. Florence 
Scovell Shinn contributes some excellent pen-and-ink 
drawings to the book. — Miss Gwendolen Overton has 
taken a western army post for the scene, and its com- 
mander's adolescent and only child for the heroine, of 
" The Captain's Daughter " (Macmillan), in which is 
shown most entertainingly how a young girl can plunge 
herself and everyone she loves into hot water by acting 
on her own responsibility in a situation where a head 
was needed much more than a heart. Though a series 
of crimes is committed and several accidents occur, the 
book is not in the least melodramatic. It will certainly 
make the duty of parents somewhat easier when girl- 
hood is at its most difficult moment. Miss Frances D. 

Jones supplies some spirited pictures " Half a Dozen 

Housekeepers " (Altemus), by Mrs. Kate Douglas 
Wiggin, is a brisk account of how six young schoolgirls 
kept house at the home of one of them during an enforced 
absence from a New England boarding-school during a 
threatened epidemic. No girls ever had a better time, 
and they left an impression on the quiet old town where 
they disported themselves which was not without per- 
manent effect. The illustrations are by Mr. Mills 
Thompson. — Mrs. Laura E. Richards, always a good 
story-teller, has collected a number of tales into a vol- 
ume entitled, from the first of them, " The Green Satin 
Gown " (Estes). She has taken a number of significant 
episodes in the life, high and low, of a New England 
city of the smaller sort, gentlefolks, mill-hands, and the 
rest appearing in her pages to advantage. The initial 
story is especially charming. Miss Etheldred B. Barry 

illustrates the book " Three Hundred Things a 

Bright Girl Can Do " (Estes) is a volume written by 
Miss Lilla Elizabeth Eelley, with numerous illustra- 
tions, from which any girl can get valuable hints toward 
usefulness both at home and in the community. Self- 
help is the best helpfulness, and to this good end Miss 
Keller's book makes valuable contributions. 

Prominent among the books dealing with 
small girls and boys is Mrs. Ruth Mc- 
Enery Stuart's "George Washington 
Jones: A Christmas Gift That Went Begging" (Alte- 
mus). Mrs. Stuart here fairly repeats the brilliant 
success of last year's " Napoleon Jackson," the same 
delightful mingling of tears and laughter being trans- 
ferred from adult to youthful life. The little colored 
boy who remembered that his grandfather had been 
sent in early boyhood as a holiday gift with the 
inscription, 

"I'ma little nigger, 
But I '11 grow bigger," 

induced the child to set forth and offer himself as a 
Christmas gift. How he adopted an aunt in the search, 
and how he came at last into his own after many dis- 
couragements, make a charming Christmas story, the 
sympathetic pictures of Mr. Edward Potthast adding to 

the general result " The Little People " (John Lane), 

by Mrs. L. Allen Harker, is quite as much for grown 
persons as for the immature, being a collection of short 
stories of English life in which children play a varied 
part, sometimes reconciling differences between parents, 
and sometimes getting into mischief which affects their 
elders. The stories are unquestionably interesting to 
the elders, but are in most instances beyond the range

of simple childhood. — Miss Elizabeth Hill records a 
pleasant recollection of a summer spent in the country 
in " My Wonderful Visit" (Scribner). " When I was 
a little girl," she begins, " I made an enchanting never- 
to-be-forgotten visit," and the words fitly describe the 
event. The visit was to a certain Cousin Sally, who 
seems to have been as sympathetic as Miss Hill and her 
illustrator, Miss Beatrice Stevens, here prove them- 
selves to be. — Mrs. Martha Finley continues her famil- 
iar annual volumes with " Elsie and her Loved Ones " 
(Dodd), wherein the " Elsie " family spend a winter in 
California, beguiling the time with stories from American 

history, generally of war " Daddy's Lad : The Story 

of a little Lass " (Nelson) is Mrs. E. L. Heverfield's ac- 
count of a small maiden with great capacity for fun on 
one side and self-devotion on the other, her father need- 
ing her more than do most fathers. — Miss Jocelyn 
Lewis's small heroine in " The Adventures of Dorothy " 
(Outlook Co.) is ten years old when she has her first 
experience in the country, a visit resulting in much inno- 
cent mischief. A small boy adds to the ensemble much 
devotion and an equal capacity for getting into trouble, 
the most exciting episodes being depicted also in Mr. 
Seymour M. Stone's illustrations. — " Five Little Pep- 
pers at School "(Lothrop) shows Mrs. Margaret Sidney's 
interesting little flock divided, the boys goiug to one 
place and the girls to another in pursuance of education, 
but not until they have done several things to show their 
kindness of heart. Mr. Hermann Heyer, evidently a 
lover of children, provides the illustrations. — " Jaue 
and John: Their Parties, Plays, and Picnics" (Little, 
Brown, & Co.) has a distinct leaning toward nature 
study in its pages, the children of the book spending 
their time inland and at the sea shore, and collecting 
everywhere specimens of all sorts of living things. The 
pictures in color by Mr. Charles E. Heil add to the 
worth of the volume. 

Fairy books seem to be as numerous 
Tales of ^ig year as ever, and more pains are 

bestowed upon them than upon any other 
class of books for small people. In this season's list 
Mr. L. Frank Baum holds the place of honor with no 
less than three books, of which two are entirely new, 
all published by the Bobbs-Merrill Co. " The Magical 
Monarch of Mo " tells of a country where everything 
the human heart can wish for is found as fruit upon the 
enviable vegetation of that favored land, a consumma- 
tion that makes socialism impossible and recommends 
itself at sight as a complete solution for all social ills. 
The pictures, as in the others of Mr. Baum's books, are 
in color, in this instance being drawn by Mr. Frank 
Verbeck. "The Enchanted Island of Yew " is in four 
quarters, " like a mince pie," and through its confines 
three mortal children ramble and make friends under 
the care of Prince Marvel, one of the best of fairies. 
Miss Fanny Y. Cory has made the illustrations and 
decorations, hardly a page being without embellishment. 
The last of Mr. Baum's three books is a new edition of 
" The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," with the text un- 
changed, but with several new pictures by Mr. William 
Wallace Denslow. The chapter in which the scarecrow 

comes to life remains one of the best of its kind. 

" Six Giants and a Griffin, and Other Stories " (Russell) 
is by Mr. Birdsall Otis Edey, with clever pictures by 
Mrs. Beatrice Baxter Ruyl. The stories show an abun- 
dant fancy, and cover a great deal of ground, mythical 
and modern. — An excellent compilation from the fairy 
lore of many lands has been made by Miss Esther 



Singleton in " The Golden Rod Fairy Book " (Dodd, 
Mead & Co.), with many pages in color from the de- 
signs of Mr. Charles Buckles Falls. France, Germany, 
England, Poland, Denmark, India, China, Bohemia, 
Ireland, Spain, Russia, and Arabia are laid under con- 
tribution, some of the stories being translated by Miss 
Singleton herself, and due credit being properly given 
in all other cases. — " The Outlook Fairy Book 
(Outlook Co.), compiled by Miss Laura Winnington, 
has not the same distinction as Miss Singleton's book, 
and the curious credit is given for several famous tales 
as taken " from the German of Hans Christian Ander- 
sen," not flattering to the countrymen of that most 
lovable of Danes. Some fairy ballads are included with 
the prose, and the pictures are by Mr. J. Conacher. 

Books of child-rhymes are this year 
aTd^ilSZ^ generally good, though not numerous; 

Miss Peabody's book, already mentioned, 
being of another class entirely and a much higher one. 
Mr. William Wells Newell has issued a second and 
greatly enlarged edition of his " Games and Songs of 
American Children," (Harper), adding much new ma- 
terial to the former book, and appealing to students no 
less than little people through the width and treat- 
ment of his subject. — " The Just So Song Book " 
(Doubleday) contains all the children's lyrics from Mr. 
Rudyard Kipling's well-known volume, set to music of 
a modern and alluring sort by Mr. Edward German. 
This is a real contribution to childish enjoyment, and 
the elders will not be lacking in appreciation of it. — 
"Songs of the Trees: Pictures, Rhymes, and Tree 
Biographies " (Bobbs-Merrill) has been written by Mrs. 
Mary Y. Robinson, with music for the songs by Miss 
Josephine Robinson. The book is arranged by months, 
each of the twelve having three full-page pictures in 
color, showing some tree or shrub having especial refer- 
ence to that time of year. The book is filled with useful 
and unobtrusive information. — " Laurel Leaves for 
Little Folk" (Lee & Shepard) is edited, illustrated, 
and decorated by Miss Mary E. Phillips, who has 
covered almost the entire range of modern American 
writers, many of the contributions from well-known 
pens being here published for the first time. The book 
is certainly stimulating, and should give many a little 
one some conception of what it is that constitutes litera- 
ture. — " Rhymes of Real Children " (Fox, Duffield & 
Co.) is by Mrs. Walter L. Goodwin, who writes under 
her maiden name of Betty Sage, with charming pictures 
in color by Miss Jessie Willcox Smith. There is more 
than average merit in these taking little bits of simple 
verse, and Miss Smith's illustrations are certain to give 
additional popularity to the volume. — Mr. O. H. von 
Gottschalk has made the pictures in color and written 
the verses for " In Gnome Man's Land " (Stokes), in 
which he sings the adventures of a small boy in a won- 
derful country where the vegetables have human life. 
The boy is present at the great battle between these 
inhabitants of the garden and a horde of army worms, 
success being finally won for the vegetables by the useful 
if irascible wasps which constitute their flying artillery.

ooksfor remain to be considered, are of many

is sure to flatten 'em," — and others of his comments on 
animal life are equally pertinent. The pictures by 
" H. T. B." are so bad that they are really good; and 
the only wonder is that we have had so long to wait for 
an American reprint of the book. — " Wanderfolk in 
Wonderland " (Small, Maynard & Co.) is a superior 
book of animal stories, the text by Miss Edith Guerrier 
and the pictures by Miss Edith Brown. The tales are 
not only witty, but under the humanizing of the birds 
and beasts which take part in them there lies real knowl- 
edge of animal psychology and habits Two pretty 

little tales of animal life have been written by Miss 
Beatrix Potter and published in separate volumes 
(Warne) with graceful illustrations in color. " The 
Tale of Squirrel Nutkin " tells of the real life of a real 
squirrel, and " The Tailor of Gloucester " relates how 
the kindness of an ancient artisan greatly troubled by 
commissions and illness is repaid by the mice he has be- 
friended "The Curious Book of Birds" (Houghton) 

is written by Mrs. Abbie Farwell Brown and illustrated 
by Mr. E. Boyd Smith. Out of many lands and from 
many sources these quaint and veracious stories have 
been gathered. Many of them are from ancient mytho- 
logical origins, and the illustrator has had these deriva- 
tions in mind in planning his designs. The book has 
no little literary merit. — " The Life of a Wooden Doll " 
(Fox, Duffield & Co.) is a long series of incidents in the 
life of its heroine, told for the most part by photographs, 
a few words being added by the book's inventor, Mr. 
Lewis Saxby. The fact that the scenes are unquestion- 
ably from real, though still, life, gives them powers of 
conviction not otherwise attainable. — " Children of the 
Arctic, by the Snow- Baby and her Mother " (Stokes) is a 
result of Lieutenant Peary's arctic life in 1893-5 in 
company with his wife, Mrs. Josephine Debitsch Peary. 
The " snow-baby," Marie Ahnighito Peary, was born to 
the exiled couple while among the eternal snows, and 
it is of what was seen through her childish eyes regard- 
ing the life of the little Eskimo youngsters that the 
book treats. Quite as much information is conveyed 
through the reproduced photographs as through the 
text, interesting though the latter is.

sible, some form of family service," and for this his

mical and efficient care of dwelling-houses." The work 
is published by the Messrs. Macmillan, and is illustrated. 

" A Calendar of John Paul Jones Manuscripts in the 
Library of Congress," compiled by Dr. Charles Henry 
Lincoln, and "A List of Lincolniana in the Library of 
Congress," prepared by Mr. George Thomas Ritchie, 
are recent bibliographical publications of our National 
Library. 

"Porto Rico: the Land of the Rich Port " is a sup- 
plementary reading-book by Mr. Joseph B. Seabury, 
published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co. At the 
same time we have from the American Book Co. a 
similar volume on " The Philippines," the work of 
Mr. Samuel MacClintock. 

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. expect to publish shortly 
a Life of Napoleon, by Professor Fournier of the Uni- 
versity of Prague. The American edition has been 
carefully translated under the editorship of Prof. E. G. 
Bourne of Yale, and will be supplied with a very useful 
bibliography of Napoleonic literature. 

Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. publish a third 
edition of " The Historical Geography of Europe," by 
Edward A. Freeman. This is a work that is not likely 
to be outdated, and the changes made by Professor 
J. B. Bury, the editor, are neither many nor of great 
consequence. The work is in two volumes, a thick one 
and a thin one, the latter containing the maps. 

Mr. Henry Frowde is the publisher of " The Songs 
of Robert Burns," now first printed with the melodies 
for which they were written. This " study in tone- 
poetry," provided with bibliography, historical notes, 
and a glossary, has been prepared by Mr. James C. Dick. 
There are included no less than thirty songs now for the 
first time printed as the work of Burns. 

" Poems You Ought to Know " is a publication of the 
Fleming H. Revell Co. It gives us in book form the 
series of brief selections that have recently appeared 
from day to day upon the front page of a Chicago news- 
paper. Mrs. Elia W. Peattie is responsible for the 
selection, which is queerly miscellaneous, although a 



majority of the pieces might fairly be admitted to be- 
long to the treasury of good English poetry. Illustra- 
tions and biographical notes add to the interest and 
usefulness of the volume. 

Messrs. Ginn & Co. publish " The Modern Age," a 
text-book by Professor Philip Van Ness Myers. This 
work is a revision and expansion of the latter part of 
the author's " Mediaeval and Modern History," the 
former part having appeared some time since in the 
revised form and in a separate volume. 

"The Alphabet of Rhetoric," by Mr. Rossiter 
Johnson, is a book for the uses of the general reader 
rather than for teaching purposes. The topics are 
alphabetically arranged, and the work is an excellent 
guide to good usage, conveniently planned for reference. 
The Messrs. Appleton are the publishers. 

" What to See in England," by Mr. Gordon Home, 
is a guide-book published by the Macmillan Co. It is 
a book of alternating pictures and text, each subject 
treated having a single page of print set opposite a full- 
page illustration. One hundred and fifty subjects are 
thus dealt with, and there are two maps. 

The late Ross Winans's "One Religion: Many 
Creeds," first published about thirty years ago, is repro- 
duced by the Messrs. Putnam in a new edition, upon the 
initiative of Mr. Walter Winans, a grandson of the 
author. The Rev. Charles Voysey contributes an intro- 
duction to the work in this its latest form. 

Ferdinand Gregorovius's " Lucretia Borgia," a study 
from the original documents, is translated from the 
third German edition by Mr. John Leslie Garner, and 
published in a handsomely-illustrated volume by the 
Messrs. Appleton. The date of the first edition was 
1874, a fact that may be worth bearing in mind. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.'s new descriptive list 
of their own publications, just issued, is made especially 
attractive by a number of colored inserts, from illus- 
trations in books published by this firm. It is, besides, 
an unusually well-arranged and intelligently-prepared 
catalogue, which every book buyer will find of use. 

The editors of "The Psychological Review" will 
celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of that 
journal by the commencement, in their January issue, 
of a special literary department, to include prompt 
consideration of current literature in psychology, phil- 
osophy, and cognate subjects, with literary news and 
announcements. 

" The Temple Series of Bible Characters and Scrip- 
ture Handbooks," published by the J. B. Lippincott Co., 
is edited by Mr. Oliphant Smeaton, and will extend to 
a considerable number of small volumes. The two now 
before us are " Abraham and the Patriarchal Age," by 
Dr. Duff, and " David, the Hero-King of Israel," by 
Canon Knox-Little. 

A number of interesting items are contained in the 
Atlantic Monthly's programme for the coming year. 
Of especial importance may be noted a series of hitherto 
unpublished extracts from Emerson's private journals, 
edited by his son; six reminiscent articles by Col. T. W. 
Higginson, entitled "Part of a Man's Life"; and Mr. 
Robert Herrick's new serial, " The Common Lot." 

Mr. Sidney Norton Deane has translated from the 
Latin, and The Open Court Co. have published, a selec- 
tion of the most important of the writings of St. Anselm. 
The selection includes the " Monologium," the "Pros- 
logium," and the " Cur Deus Homo" together with 
Gaunilon's "In Behalf of the Fool," written as an 



1903.] 



THE DIAL 



481 



appendix to the first-named of these works. Criticisms 
of the ontological doctrine by various philosophers are 
also added to the volume by way of apparatus. 

" Witnesses of the Light," by the Rev. Washington 
■Gladden, is a volume made up of the William Belding 
Noble lectures for 1903. These lectures are given at 
Harvard, during the season of Advent. They are six 
in number, in the present instance, their subjects being 
Dante, Michel Angelo, Fichte, Hugo, Wagner, and 
Ruskin. Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. publish the 
volume. 

About a year ago, Dr. Edward Everett Hale was 
persuaded to write for the New York " American " at 
the rate of three articles a week for the period of three 
months. The thirty-nine leaders thus resulting, together 
with some other contributions to journalism made at the 
same time, are now collected into a volume entitled 
" We, the People," which is published by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. 

« The Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe " and « The 
Best Poems and Essays of Edgar Allan Poe," are two 
companion volumes edited by Mr. Sherwin Cody, and 
published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. Both 
volumes are supplied with biographical and critical 
matter by the editor, and are issued in uniform style 
with his earlier illustrations of the short story and the 
English essay. 

"A Little Booke of Poets' Parleys," by Miss Charlotte 
Porter and Miss Helen A. Clarke, is a series of imag- 
inary conversations upon such subjects as America, 
evolution, love, music, war, and woman, each involving 
two poets, whose works are drawn upon for character- 
istic quotations. The idea is a capital one, and it is 
skilfully carried out. Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. 
are the publishers. 

Mr. L. Cope Cornf ord's " Essay-Writing for Schools," 
published by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co., is not exactly 
a text-book, although it might well serve for one. It is 
addressed to young writers, whether in or out of school, 
and its method is that of persuasion enforced by ex- 
ample. The case of the novelist turned rhetorician is 
somewhat unusual, but in the present instance the meta- 
morphosis is certainly praiseworthy. 

Dr. E. Moore's third series of " Studies in Dante " 
will consist of miscellaneous essays, dealing with the 
astronomy and geography of Dante, the date assumed 
by Dante for the vision of the Divina Commedia, sym- 
bolism and prophecy in the last six cantos of the Pur- 
gatorio, the genuineness of the dedicatory epistle to 
Can Grande, etc. The Oxford University Press will 
issue the volume very shortly. 

The Macmillan Co. publish " Practical Lessons in Hu- 
man Physiology, Personal Hygiene, and Public Health," 
a school text-book by Mr. John I. Jegi. The book is 
marked by exaggerations and one-sided statements on 
the subject of narcotics that are usual in texts of this 
character, resulting from the unholy activities of the 
" temperance " fanatics, and their ill-advised meddling 
in the matter of public education. 

" Tittlebat Titmouse " is the title given to what is 
called " a new and improved edition " of Warren's 
" Ten Thousand a Year." The volume is published by 
the Funk & Wagnalls Co., and the " improvements " 
have been made by the Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady. 
They turn out to be sins of omission, the resulting vol- 
ume being about one-third the size of the original. Mr. 
Brady's excuse for the abridgment is found in the 
approval of Dr. E. W. Warren, the son of the author. 



The Messrs. Scribners are the importers of the 
following reprints: "The Cavalier in Exile," by the 
Duchess of Newcastle; "Dante's Divine Comedy: the 
Book and its Story," by Leigh Hunt; and a thin-paper 
edition of the novels of Thomas Love Peacock, seven 
books in one, a veritable multum in parvo of literary 
delight, filling nearly a thousand pages, printed on thin 
paper, and bound in flexible leather. It would be diffi- 
cult to get more money's worth than this within a single 
pair of covers.

"The Dial" has always stood for character. It has 
the old Puritan conscience on which everything that is 
lasting in our country is built. It is sane, wise, truthful ; 
it is honest, hopeful, and kindly, and with all this it is the 
best journal of literary criti- 
cism which we have, and we 
ask no better. 

David Starr Jordan. 
Stanford University, 

April 18, 1900. 



"The Dial" seems at present the most unbiased, 
good humored, and sensible organ of American 
criticism. 



The good sense, the sound critical judgment, the liberal 
spirit, the high principles of " The Dial," all maintained 
with simplicity, steadiness, and without pretension, have 
secured the respect as well as the cordial regard of its 
readers. 

Charles Eliot Norton. 
Harvard University,

" The Dial " is easily our

continue to be so. John Burroughs.

Poems of Tennyson i b 57 n *V l $ 

*** WITH AN INTRODUCTION *** 

By HENRY VAN DYKE 



The work of the most popular of English poets is here arranged and edited by one of 
his most distinguished students. Dr. Van Dyke's Introduction is most comprehensive 
and comprises one quarter of the book. It includes the following chapters. 



J. Tennyson's Place in the 

Nineteenth Century. 
II. An Outline of Tennyson's 
Life. 
III. Tennyson's Uses of his 
Sources. 



IV. Tennyson's Revisions of 

his Text. 
V. The Classification of 

Tennyson's Poems. 
VI. The Qualities of Tenny* 

son's Poetry. 



The book has been made by the Merrgmoant Press in special anticipation of the holiday 
sale, and is unusual in its attractiveness. The photogravure illustrations, which are 
also Dr. Van Dyke's selection, are from sources not easily available, and some of then) 
have been hitherto unpublished. It is the intention of the editor and publishers to make 
this volume the most inviting form in which the poet has been offered to the general reader.

The Variorum Edition of Shakespeare 

Edited by HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Ph.D., LL.D., L.H.D. 



THE monumental -work undertaken by Dr. Furness has been received everywhere with high critical approval, and 
with its extended preface, its various readings, its explanatory and critical notes, its discussion of the merits of the 
different texts, of the date of composition and of the source of the plots, and its array of English and Continental 
criticisms and bibliography and alphabetical index, it supplies what is indispensable to the thorough study and 
intelligent enjoyment of the plays. 

" These monumental volumes are the admiration of every true student of Shakespeare," says Dr. Wit.T.tax 
Axjdis Wright. 

The London Athenceum states, "This, the most exhaustive work on Shakespeare's plays, comes from America." 

Dr. W. J. Rolfe declares of a recent volume. " This, too. like its predecessors, is . . . the entire literature of 
the subject compressed into a single volume, and the more valuable for the editor's personal contributions thereto." 

The thirteen volumes which have so far appeared are :
